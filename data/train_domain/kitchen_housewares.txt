i picked up dozen home depot less than $5 . same concept , just lot cheaper ! two them holding huge heavy shelf my kitchen . hole they make depends upon weight what they're holding . i'm sure it pinhole sized if you're hanging something weighs few ounces ( which case , you don't need this - use pushpin ! )the holes shelf bigger than pin-sized , but it heavy shelf . hole still way smaller than hole i'd make using any kind hook would hold such heavy shelf . it also takes little practice figure out where hang hooks ( drop hook below where you might want thing actually hang . ) this small detail , but if you need two these things you don't it right , your object gonna crooked . but bright side , you won't huge hole patch when you redo it ! recommended product ( but look around knockoffs .	1
kitchenaid kfpw760 exactly advertised . it three nested work bowls . inner , smallest one takes special blade ( smaller version standard processor blade ) . it perfect pulverizing/mixing small quantities things . pulling used bowl out leaves next one ready use without stop clean something . same true next one until you reach largest , 12 cup bowl . number blades come well designed transparent strong storage box ( finally , way keep everything together ) . unit even fruit juicer accessory replaces bowl . it kind rotating hub ( two hub sizes included , one lemons larger one oranges , etc ) . while it seems work , it not convenient low cost dedicated version such black decker , but what heck , it worth trying . motor quiet you get real feeling professionalism when using it . first i disappointed there weren't any fancy front panel switch options , but after thinking it , you only need provided , off pulse . would i buy it again ? absolutely . would i buy it again amazon ? again , absolutely . transaction without difficulty shipment actually came earlier than promised	1

after reading every review deep fryers i could find , i finally decided this one . it great i couldn't ask anything better or more easy use . i put it my cooktop let my big hood suck away any odors . it heats up quickly food always come out great . we made donuts after cooking shrimp halibut no cross-odors or tastes ! my family only tolerates fish , so this greatly appreciated . cleanup easy also . after waiting oil cool , pan , lid rack go into dishwasher . only heating element cleaned hand it quite easy . oil used many times without problems so it more economical use than i originally thought it would . i would recommend this no caveats	1

i've through four these expensive units . they work great my great pyrenees dog . least they work awhile . then i end up trying figure out if batteries dead , then if new batteries i put dead begin , then i send it back repair . once i got back unit worked again - awhile . then i got back unit never worked again . i stopped sending my broken units after . so - desperation , impending poverty , i switched shock collar ; it either or what my breeder calls " blue juice special " . it also worked - yes , i tried it myself decided it wasn't cruel all . but punchline this : shock collars broke same rate citronella collar . least they cheaper , so i didn't lose much money	-1
i set it up my dogs because they bark whenever they hear noise or if someone rings bell , i 3 dogs , i put it they went beserk , they started going after each other , i didn't hear anything myself , but i am quite sure dogs , like i said they acted very badly towards each other , tone must made them lash out like . i cannot use it anymore .	-1
it appears viatek product ( bark stop pro ) related lentek design ( pc16 ; asin : b0002q89o6 ) - they based common design lentek engineer . i used ( tried ) viatek bark stop pro it definitely not work . my experience same reviewer lentek pc16 who noted unit only works " audible " setting - dogs least perk up their ears high pitch tone ; they completely ignore whatever emitted " ultrasonic " setting . furthermore , it often activated extraneous noises like birds , banging doors , wind noise , etc . this really poor functionality due either poor design or poor construction / quality . i've tried two different units they both not work . negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices tuned noise environment could filter out all except actual barks .	-1

i black fusion my home office ( which next basement-level theater room ) , my wife i already love this machine . we tried all sorts mixes , we've only scratched surface what this machine . this one first times i've so impressed product i wanted write review it . physical properties : it handles travel mugs ( if you remove drip tray , which largely unneeded anyway ) , all our " standard " mugs . drink head moves up down , so it sit flush against rim your mug cut down already rare splashbacks ( more common " frothy " drinks than coffee tea ) . when it brews filterpack , it blows air through end cycle clear it out ( , thus , keep it dripping you remove it ) . water tank could larger ( if only because we're so enamored it we keep making drinks all day long ) , but if you ready source water nearby , it shouldn't problem . tank fits better slides easier than senseo ( which we also ) . flavor-wise : it made mm/mars , so you bet sweeter drinks ( so-called indulgence fare ) excellent . coffee blends quite good , especially darker roasts like " french roast " " sumatra " . lattes made espresso roast taste similar starbucks , moreso than other chains . clean-up : wipe inside drink head , possibly front plastic column ( colored portion ) after any particularly " splashy " drinks . no need worry cleaning up area around machine , especially if you keep drink head rim your mug . course , you can't watch its magic when drink head low , so your first few times , you'll probably get drip here there . final bits : we've senseo since its launch . pods need " pre-wetting " avoid blowing past seal portafilter not-so-great varieties drinks , senseo lagging behind flavia . we drink coffee , tea , espresso drinks , mixed blends , swee t-t ooth-friendly " indulgence " mixes every day flavia , it brain-dead-easy use . certainly easier clean up after , too ! if you're fence flavia other single-cup offerings ( like senseo ) , get flavia . keurig other single-cup offerings can't touch variety drinks you make flavia . i'm sipping lemon/blueberry tea blend now , made over ice , it fantastic . highly recommended	1
like many people , i ignorant neighbors allow their yappy mutt bark . despite talking neighbor politely such , they still no concern noise pollution . i losing sleep , barking getting so bad i even considered moving ! desperation , we looked online something stop barking dogs . we came across viatek super bark stop decided risk money . wow , talk worth money ! my husband affixed device piece wood , staked it 5 feet high our back yard . it unsightly , yes , but we're only ones really see it . more importantly , it right line barking mutt . first time he tested it , he told me dog jumped out its skin ! we laughed gleefully . could good night sleep actually horizon ...? it several days super bark stop worked amazingly . dog lie far it away device ... when it usually lay middle neighbor yard . if it starts yelp little , it stops almost immediately . it if it afraid bark . yay ! you select volume , tone , number barks help eliminate false activation ( say , talking or loud bird squawking ) . audible inaudible both work fine , but we now keep it inaudible two bark setting . device waterproof plastic you need 4 batteries ( not included ) operate it . i am so thankful we found super bark stop ! my nerves really getting jangled i dreading early mornings , when they put mutt outside . it amazing how inconsiderate neighbors ; just because you may want dog doesn't mean i want saddled its noise while you neglect it ! p.s. after using bark stop 2 weeks ( yes , it work ! ) , we noticed neighbors dog started bark bit more . ( not bad before , though . ) we it silent , realized it stopped working . apparently , it not 100% waterproof , despite claims manufacturer . person i bought it said " once it opened , we find it not 100% waterproof " . well guess what ? you gotta open it put batteries it ! either buy faux bird house protect bark stop or house it where it won't get wet . otherwise , you may find yourself same position we . we got refund , fortunately us , our neighbors got rid their dog ... so we didn't bother getting new one	1
