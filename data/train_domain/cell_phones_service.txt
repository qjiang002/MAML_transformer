my motorola c139 net10 crashed me . i called net10 they promptly sent me out new phone , except they sent me this flip phone ( v171 ) . i liked my candy bar phone didn't want this flip piece junk . i happy net10 service up point my old phone failing , then things quickly went downhill . net10 would not transfer my number replacement phone , even though i minutes available old phone . i gave my wife v171 use took back her our cingular phone , which works awesome no problems . she problems all time v171 . she always type area codes all numbers dialed , even local numbers . she also problems trying dial number phone would not dial after pressing all numbers phone hitting send . my opinion , v171 completely worthless . overall , i am very dissatisfied customer . my recommendation stay away this phone this service . go shop cingular all great deals they	-1
i agree " it too good true " statement this package . material used earbud charger really cheap !. charger melted car after sunny day , i couldn't even test it . earphone quality not good well , giving constant humming noise . case best out these three so far . so one out three 10 bucks . i am not recommending anyone buy this item .	-1
i looking forward speck rubberized cover some excitement , however i disappointed . while cover fits very well it may work industrial environment , after first day it looks like it two years old . if you sd card your treo forget it -- belt clip pop your card daily . belt clip itself afterthought easily sliding off your belt . don't even think putting treo your pocket non-slip cover won't begin slide into your pocket . finally , price $32.95 outrageous $5 cover . if you're industrial enviroment this may your cover , but rest us ... keep shopping or buy insurance	-1
i sprint almost 10 years , all told . i picture mail account them 3 years . just recently , without any warning , whatsoever , they deleted over 500 my precious pictures my picture mail account ... pics accumulating many which safely soundly sitting there most period time . most these pics very important me now lost forever . ( i only backed up 45 them . ) i guess it my own fault trusting sprint , but they offered no real explanation when i tried pics recovered , not only could they not , but they said they no record me ever picture account i them almost three years !!! this worst thing any service company ever me ! so , my advice : don't trust sprint !!! again , this happened any warning ! it could happen you too ! trust me : avoid sprint all costs ! i should	-1

i got this cyber monday $20 too . i thought i couldn't go wrong $20 . well , i wrong -- it twenty dollars completely wasted . i'd feel bad giving this pos away ... i could not get thing stay put , boom mike so bottom-heavy it won't stay close my cheek even sitting still ! it pokes out 3 feet side my head ( it seems like it anyway ) if i am moving around all ! almost like it designed get far away my voice possible . but even holding stupid thing my hand not help sound quality . i got constant complaints i could not heard very well . there only couple things saving this 1 star rating . first , i only pay $20 it . second , it decent quality , just piss-poor design . three , i liked when i clicked button ( not due incoming call ) , it automatically launched voice dial menu , so i could really make call without ever touching my cell phone . i guess one perks same mfr both headset phone . but it fails miserably it primary design goal , so i heartily recommend staying away this product	-1

great concept : protective rubber skin protects blackberry unit accidental drops scratches . rubbery material tends collect all sorts dust lint . it very hard get it off ( unless you wash it water or use tape peel it off ) . protective cover doesn't fit around screen too well . mine tends stretched out little more left side than right ( even if i try reposition unit itself ) . plastic screen cover ( removed ) already scratched due way it packaged . all all , i am pretty disappointed ... mainly because i paid over $33 it . it now sitting my desk work collecting dust	-1
i enjoyed using this phone some time . it functional , it felt solid , it nice low profile look . however , after around year half , continued act opening closing phone caused hinge crack , gradually break off completely . i now hold phone together my hand while i talk , which extremely awkward . this especially frustrating given rest phone so well made . furthermore , it seems unfortunately failed just before my " upgrade " opportunity ( couple months ) , right after my purchase some extra accessories ( batteries/chargers ) . search around online " a670 hinge " you find lot other people problems like mine . this itself wouldn't problem if samsung would willingly replace phone . however , they not claiming it design defect , neither samsung nor verizon offering replace it . bad form both , although perhaps verizon isn't much blame . i would avoid both samsung this phone because this incident . this phone seemingly designed durable , but it frankly not meant long haul , too pricey given its average performance .	-1

when i recieved this item , i mixed emotions product . one hand , black finish looked very nice , clear plastic covering protected screen but still easy read . also , all side buttons fairly easy reach average-sized fingers ( except maybe camera button ) , so navigating phone cover still closed pretty easy unless you need use touch functions or open qwerty keyboard . however , due padding nature metal materials , case very thick bulky - when using belt clip , phone sticks out far enough it not even rest evenly your hip , but leans angle . but , deciding factor my two-star rating this case cause only two times i dropped my cingular 8525 ( which such steep price , not something i like drop ) . problem lies snap-shut system closes case . because metal so thin , it not secure very well , come open pretty easily . fix this , i simply bent piece metal downward towards phone , so it much harder both open close case . this , most part , solves problem , but it still dangerous caution definately order . my favorite thing this case you open case slide keyboard open without actually taking phone out case . this nice because it enable quick replies text messages . this only reason i not give it one-star rating . i am currently looking soft case , preferably leather sleeve case i just pull my phone out off my hip , rather than bother clip anymore . final warning - careful if you buy this case . plus , i seriously not believe it worth its steep price point	-1

prior buying this phone i heard lot people say motorola hardware very good , but their software left lot desired . nonetheless i decided try this phone out when it came time start new cell plan . i made decision switch t-mobile this looked like one best phone options . right off bat i found out people who criticized moto software right money . there host poorly designed software aspects this phone , not least which -- frankly -- idiotic way phone book designed . eventually i made peace all things i disliked v360 since least it seemed work well enough phone . time went i started noticing i missing lot calls . phone would my bag or my pocket or sitting my desk when suddenly it would ring voicemail notification message i received anywhere minutes hours before . during course last few months ( phone less than year old ) i've also found it begun crashing . lot . opening or closing it result " white screen death . " putting it charger cause it switch back forth messages it charging , it unable charge it sim card cannot found , after few minutes which it simply shut itself off . full battery charge it continually shut itself off . this point i am forced conclude this phone absolute piece junk . i am also forced conclude it isn't only model which . none my coworkers ever good experience motorola phone . my wife motorola shown its own host problems . people working t-mobile several stores i visited confided they never , ever recommend motorola phones anyone . fact i've t-mobile employees urge me not buy any phones them , but rather shop unlocked nokia online . so that what i'm going . until i buy new phone all i recharge this phone every night , restart it five or six times day , keep apologizing my friends , family employers always missing their calls	-1

i think logitech make best accessories . i camera , fancy dinovo bluetooth keyoard ..... so naturally this headset no brainer . reason i got it use it my computer setup opposed looking like dork walking around public . it worked my dell 9200 laptop fine skype however it not work my dell 8400 desktop using logitech bluetooh hub . don't you find strange ? aside , it also not work my sony ericsson phone ( can't remember model ) . addition , it really hurts my ears .. not most comfortable .... so you decide if this product works you .	-1
i originally purchased logitech mobile freedom headset but when clip goes behind your ear broke , logitech exchanged it mobile traveller . unfortunately , this one not comfortable all . i agree others after 30-45 minutes , it feels like your ear vise . it true . it hurts . sound quality very good . people say they hear me just fine , i hear them just fine . but it also disconnects my cell phone when it not use . what good ? then when phone rings , i don't hear it . then clip broke this one well . logitech again replaced it . but how long this one lsat ? yourself favor skip this one	-1
i ordered motorola razr v3 mauve phone ( unlocked)a month ago . i hoping get color i saw web page ... that where problem lies . image shown completely misleading . phone i received , mauve but different one picture shown amazon web site . mauve phone i got grayish dull mauve not pretty pinkish mauve advertised . also , phone 2 different color tones . night/in lighting night , top part phone(the part flips open ) its corresponding part back phone looks completely gray . needless say , i spoke customer service sent phone back exchange . i didn't pay shipping charges . 2nd phone came same color problem again , so 2nd time i returned it got my money refunded . i gave 1 star due customer service provided , but again they could not help me . some one said it could item defect .... but methe whole experience disappointing . if you ready spend so much this phone its because brand , ' color ' which you never get because amazon put wrong image web page ... very misleading wrong all customers . incidentally , this color seen offered verizon they call it ' pink ' , but amazon calls it ' mauve ' , though phone image shown not match . so stay away ordering this pretty mauve phone ... all you get loads disappointment your time wasted .	-1

i reluctantly bought this phone because my kyocera slider suddenly died me conveniently 3 months after vm warranty up i just purchased $20 phone card + airtime credits which not refundable . now i am not teen my phone things not receive harsh treatment . my kyocera slider actually looked like new when it died no scratches what-so-ever so i pretty upset . after multiple calls 2 emails vm it pretty clear they weren't going anything help . i offered replacement slider $20 . obviously i didn't want same one could possibly die me after couple months so like i saying i no other recourse but purchase this audiovox 8610 . way after i purchased phone local store town ( when i called activate phone)they nerve tell me i could've purchased same 8610 them discount price $24.99 because slider died . ! @%ng idiots ! hello could ya not told me sooner ??? after i spent $50 + tax . sheesh ! anyway back phone review .. ringer indeed low others reported here . its so low if its my purse i can't even hear it ! wtf ??? also battery life sucks , no sooner thing ring batteries half . it also doesnt get good service vm/sprint network , my slider xcellent service w/it despite everything rarely if ever dropped calls . so i've it 5 days i'm considering attempting bring it back where i purchased it . however i don't want buy expensive phone vm because i'm seriously reconsidering continuing w/them . way i see it vm leaves alot desired quality phones they sell + they expensive . i am lite user but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet- wise . prior these issues i happy vm customer but not anymore .	-1
bought cell phone battery this company it defective died one week after their return/replacement deadline . shouldn't cell phone battery last longer than month ?? they refuse refund or replace . they shady company i'll never business them again warn others same	-1
i bought this because my 8525 eats batteries it nice one charging while i'm using other -- you don't tied wire charge your phone . so i also bought one boxwave batteries 8525 . well , spare battery charger charge boxwave battery just fine , but it refuses charge battery came my 8525 . this really limits its usability off-line charging device . cradle itself plugs into usb port phone , which not designed cradling mind , so it not easy get thing lined up use actual cradle . since camera button bottom phone ( who idea anyway ? ) it almost always gets pressed while i'm wiggling phone or out cradle . this just bit nuisance it just means you quit camera application every time you put it or take it out docking station . anyway , just my opinion , but it actually easier connect standard usb charger phone than it put it cradle , so i'd recommend save your money just sticking standard usb charger . if you really want all charging off-line you may need buy two boxwave batteries instead just one	-1
when i first received items they didn't work them i returned spend more money they still don't work . i even computer specialist work try they couldn't even get them work . i sent them e-mail receive my money back , because i didn't want keep spending money send items back don't work back . who would guessed , but they never replied . thanks waisting my time money . i never buy any you again inform others beware	-1

i got rid bulky i355s end our contract bought two these our account . we return first phone ( line1 ) within days getting it it would randomly shut off ( crash ) , other times volume would fluctuate its own . exchanging it ordeal sprint - they charged me replacement phone still haven't credited my account after two billing cycles . few months later now second phone ( line2 ) crashing . i'll make call hang up - it shuts off . other times it shut off middle call . other night i went charge it it said invalid battery - so i took battery out put it back . then it said " invalid charger . " i might go back i355 , it rugged , reliable ( but large ) phone . i guess i'll haggle motorola getting this one fixed/replaced	-1
i've my headset month now . noted reviewer , this headset not come any buttons or switches - only thing cord shirt clip . 6 different ear gels included accomodate different ears , which nice ( though i've only ever used one ) . headset very easy slip into my ear ( only takes 1 second ) comfortable up 2 hours wear ( which point my ear starts get little sore ) . my boyfriend reported similar experience other headsets use ear gels . if you regularly stay phone longer than 2 hours , it something keep mind . however , it suits my needs just fine , low price , i think it really great buy	1
my perception headset very confortable use clarity my voice fine . i use headset all day without any discomfort . i higly recommend it over other types headset	1

phone great . you check all specs online other posts . you'll see they're awesome . my experience ... pros : - lots features- slick phone ... i care how my gadgets look like . - camera resolution pretty good . cons : - hard find good case . i'm still looking good one . one i got , my phone slip out it once while . - if you bmw want bluetooth it , fugget'boutit .... althought it not really phone fault , but bmw ( i've read other msg boards ) , it quite frustrating me when i tried hook up my new phone my new bmw ...	1

i owned one these three months , then it started fall apart . it $30 best buy . i haven't replaced it , $30 * lot * . $10 ? i'm buying two more . i moving 20 mph my bicycle , talking someone , no problems . it far better sound quality than my ' backup ' , which jabra no boom . ear volume adjustable my phone , i'm wondering what phones other reviewers won't let them adjust volume	1
these work great keeping earbuds comfortably place while allowing one hear others speaking , say grocery store . course they not provide audiophile quality sound , but they're great listening podcasts while doing shopping . only downside they bulky so not fit any earbud holder while not use . taking eargels off store earbuds off possible but difficult enough annoying	1
i purchased pink razr cingular service couldn't happier . i it month no problems all . i am very happy it . t-mobile not very good service my opinion why i chose cingular	1
i this almost 6 months i like it lot . right off , it looks great . black leather , blue piping going around edge . blue vivid color one those exotic/expensive fish tank fish : neons or tetras ? whichever it , it very sharp looking . i keep i860 cell phone ' glove all time . it not add much bulk/size/weight phone . it fits it , after all , like glove . when i am taking photo , i simply unsnap half flip-up half my cell phone which where camera lens , take photo , slip it back . before i used know this , i used press down little strap it would get way , like wayward lock hair . turns out futzing strap unnecessary . they designed it so you just remove half case , take photo(s ) , snap it back . smart . fact , reason strap there first place so you easily remove other half . look what end strap before you curse it , guys . it snap ! snaps unsnap ; what they . glove well named . it makes phone much easier grip your hand . i easily pivot it around my hand , flip it around , pick it up , basically not expect it skid around . without ' glove , you bare metal or plastic case . smooth looking - well , maybe too smooth something small costing hundreds dollars ! i like fast release belt hook . so far , it not failed me . i think it bottom , not back way some people said , but i cannot remember certain . i know it goes off easily me but never come off its own yet . i don't use it way much though . i860 not much bigger than one those little matchbox cars 1960s . i easily fit it my pocket . glove , i know it probably not going get scratched too easily	1
this headseat pretty neat when you're road or just relaxing work . it easily switches media player handsfree headset when you get call also controls pause/play answer/hangup features . comfort ear budds could little better , but stereo sound great	1
this really cool phone many features . unfortunately , you could not use some these features u.s. one thing i not understand why unlocked phones so expensive us retailers charge much more price . its price just 429.99 nokia web page . phone gets 5 stars but retailer price gets -2 stars .	1
if you don't use this phone , it costs $3/month . normal hours til 9 p.m. it 12 cents per minute , which bit less than half what most prepaid phones cost . perfect my occasional use locating family members when i'm transit feel i simply must know where they what they doing . i don't use cell phones much , but if i must one , i might well one doesn't make me worry huge bill . kids who think they mangle budget , forget it cuz when card used up -- that it kiddo . once they use up card , only number they dial 911 , but that it . bonus features : clock always accurate it great alarm which tells me when get up go work tell me when go home end day . some point , i might not able live without this .	1
i this motorola v171 year now i absolutely love it . features so easy understand . customer service reps net 10 wireless very hard understand . this phone net 10 wireless phone . net 10 wireless subsidiary tracfone . i would this phone anybody looking prepaid cell phone plan . i love it because only limited time you get 300 minutes free upon activation your phone . i would also strongly recommend if anybody purchases this motorola activate it [ ... ] its whole lot easier than calling	1
i use this all time . it gives good protection , ease use , good handling . only disadvantage you not keep it when putting unit vetical dock . however , this true any protective skin . outstanding product .	1
when i first got this , it not look like it big enough my phone , but soon i opened package put my phone it i could tell it perfect fit . i really like clear window , which i not my previous case , now i see who calling answer my phone without take it out case every time	1
provides great protection treo , but add noticeable amount thickness , making it more bundle	1
i'm not really gadget guy , what gadgets i get pretty beat up . when company gave me treo 650 so i " stay touch " , i needed least take care thing . so , i bought this skin speck products . its absolutely awesome ! no more dings or scratches . i'm minimalist , treo 650 skin perfect ! cool look , not bulky . easy access buttons . they their homework this product . must anyone who owns treo 650 . i also see they these blackberries	1
when i bought my motorola v220 , my cingular store charged top dollar car charger - they sold out . i thrilled when i found this starter set amazon . car charger compatible v220 , it comes case hands-free ear bud - all less than i would paid charger alone . ear bud not best sound - voices come across somewhat muffled , though still audible - case adequate . i wouldn't buy this set specifically those items , although they both work with/fit v220 . i see it , they bonuses purchasing charger . five stars charger , three rest	1
i really like this phone .. its cute , its little , its perfect young woman . i pocket pc prior this it so complicated just making call . i wanted something simple , wasn't mp3 player ( i ipod ) , wasn't professional camera ( i nice digital cam ) , or pda ( i palm tx ) ... its just simple cute . its bluetooth compatible ... although doesnt work great my bluetooth , but i'm not sure if its headset or phone .. ** ringer it super quiet ... almost point you barely hear it your purse . i'm grown accustomed " listening " vibrate feature instead . i like how you put person picture next their name your contact list . i wear it back pocket my jeans its comfortable . sound quality good , both endsi dig it . im sure you too	1
fits cell phone well seems secure . i like catch holds it belt keep it slipping off belt when sitting dow	1
i purchased this phone replace my land line not disappointed . i haven't used all functions yet ( downloading music ) , but haven't any problems anything else . here some pros cons : pros1-colorful/clear display2-good volume ( ringer volume loud enough i hear callers just fine)3-easy menu navigationcons1-no shortcut get main menu ( keep pressing " back " button)2-battery access ( it really hard take casing off get battery sim card-could good thing though)3-on/off button ( it very small-basically use my fingernail )	1
i'm quite happy this car charger . it much faster than old one i used earlier ericsson cf388 . quite simply , it what supposed	1
easy snap it wont come off easy like others . protects well not hinder any functions	1
this cover great , it provides buffer scratches absorbs some trauma phone if dropped . it isn't soft leather so if you want protect your razr you might want consider shield	1
this case pretty good snaps sec it not too bulky . come belt clip if u need i	1
this great product . it actually fits into my ear properly i hear clearly through it . it easy operate charge last many days . i would recommend this product anyone who looking earpiece fits comfortably just right size	1
i motorola h300 before ... this leaps bounds better . sound quality both units great but i'm impressed weight this lg unit . it like comparing stones feathers ( bit exagerated but you get point ... ) . this lg unit also protruding ear bud , which sits snuggly my ear . motorola unit didn't ... which often dangled swayed like last apple tree right before it falls . caused discomfort i tilt my head bit keep unit against my ear . new lg , i no longer look like i stiff neck while i'm driving	1
it fits great but doesn't cover corners phone ... kinda point case . seam top ear piece sharp stabs your ear if not careful . bolt back not removable so if you not plan use belt clip you're stuck it sticking out your pocket .	1
use it every day , it nice connector just what it says it . all treo/palm connectors , you need make sure contacts clean get good connection . wiggling connector where it meets treo usually enough it work me	1
this nice cellphone . i got it local cellphone shop . free only 1 year contract . eventually prices free like motorola razor v3 . small phone i like mp3 player mode :	1
this holster holds v220 securely place . only problem might it hard pull it out holster without flipping it open thus answering phone .	1
i'm long-running virgin customer , but additionally i work developer mobile industry , so i've experience using literally scores handsets every imaginable carrier ( including non-us ) . previous virgin phones i've used include vox 8610 kyocera 2255 . my 8610 still works , but it bit bulky heavy my tastes i decided upgrade . let start positives : -very compact design . this probably cheapest phone its size/capabilities available anywhere . it so thin when i put it same pocket my wallet , i sometimes forget it there . -for cost , it pretty decent terms features . 128x128 screen fullscreen graphic support , 10 mb downloads ( 32 total ) , speakerphone , web capability , comparable performance most nokia series 40 devices . very long battery life , fast charging . those trouble battery i suggest you try turning off backlight . it might ... interesting ... effects . -uses sprint network . i've found this very reliable my area , signal quality excellent both outdoors . -call quality good . comparable 8610 far i tell , which also good ( my old kyocera , other hand , garbage ) . -ui solid , standard design . predictive text included messaging . phone graphics bit odd , but not necessarily bad ways . -durable . utstarcom knows how build last . this handset no exception . -good library games , ringtones , graphics available . now i actually something spend all balance ... -virgin very low cost provider . it no good if you want video demand , 3g , or whatnot . but just making calls/texting now then , you simply can't beat $20/3 months . no annual contract well , which huge plus ( many who've one know all too well ) . downside : -keys bit small . this typical ultra-thin handsets . they bit stiff well , which good bad ( good because you won't accidentally press them easily , bad because typing more pain ) . -virgin web browser lame . their web service costs extra , it problems viewing many page formats ( says ' network gremlins ' when you try ... cute ) . you browse basic html , that it- good luck reading e-mail it . -no bluetooth built-in , though this expected . -no camera either , also expected . this actually good thing , since camera phones off-limits more areas than you might expect . bottom line : this handset great price . there flaws it , any phone , but pluses outweigh minuses . i've seen many reviewers complain both virgin phone , but my professional opinion ( it expert opinion ) these people need realize you get what you pay . this isn't $200 samsung t519 , you're not paying $60 month service 2 year contract . considering costs , slice great handset excellent service ,	1
two week reviewi got this phone use phone am very happy it . i it two weeks now so this early review . first , qualifier . i nice canon camera don't want use my phone take pictures . i don't want use my phone listen music or surf internet either , i just want it make receive calls maybe text here there . if you one those people different agenda your phone , then this probably not phone you . goodsize great . this phone comparable hershey bar thickness width , but shorter . it fits my pants or shirt pocket without feeling bulky . it makes razr feel thick , but i am guessing it comparable slvr . slice good sound quality such small phone . it also good reception . sprints network not best my area , but my slice able connect wherever i am maintains strong connection even 1 bar . when i car , road noise got too loud hear , but when i hit speakerphone button i could hear fine , keep my hands wheel . virgin definitely most affordable option if you not planning use phone lot . i expect spend $150 $200 this first year , including $50 up front phone . cheapest monthly plan big carriers would cost me least 500 over same period local taxes fees included . although i haven't tried them , it looks like monthly plans virgin pretty reasonable too if i start getting into kind usage level . many other virgin phones look like toys . although this ones name sounds like toy people under 18 recognize it , it also looks like real piece equipment . older professional i am not embarrassed plop this phone conference table meeting vp . ( vibrate mode course ) same time , my 12 year old hoping i hate it get phone so he this one because it so cool . ui well designed easy navigate except ridiculous menu . what they smoking when they decided use pig " my account , " dragon " messaging , " etc . other than , features all where you would expect them navigating menus quite intuitive . can't really comment reliability this phone after just two weeks , but it already dropped twice still works fine . badperhaps because they affordable other ways , virgin screws you ringtones background . four ringtones included unacceptable , you blocked up or down loading your own . they pretty big collection their website you get $2.50 pop , but none them sound like phone . included wallpapers chosen most despicable choices possible too , so you likely fork out $2.00 wallpaper their web site well . buttons little too small . most time i fine , but every once while i hit two keys or wrong key because they so small . course once numbers all loaded into contacts speed dials set i haven't run into problem any more . battery life not lived up what i read , but might because how i use it . if i charge it every night i am fine . i ordered extra charger keep office one car well just case . summaryafter two weeks i am happy this phone would recommend it someone looking phone use making phone calls . it not big extras like camera , but what it it well . virgin uses sprint network , see if you find out their network your area before you buy virgin phone .

almost 2 years ago , my fiance i signed up 2-year contract verizon . we got great deal both phones . two years later , both phones excellent condition very few scratches dents . this great phone someone who would still like option take pictures short videos but not use it heavily . i 38 pictures saved my phone right now sending picture messages extremely easy relatively quick this phone . pros : - sturdy : it not thin or flimsy some newer ultra-thin phones . i dropped my phone so many times my phone still excellent condition . thing i really like when you drop phone , battery doesn't detach easily . everytime i dropped my old sony ericsson , battery would also detach i'd restart my phone . - compact : though it thicker side , this samsung very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it . - good buttons : those who text message lot , way buttons feel really make difference . buttons this phone smooth great texting . - menu short cuts : side phone , you adjust your ringtone volume simply pressing up or down arrow . if you hold # , your phone goes into vibrate mode . if press camera button right hand side phone camera video menu pop up . you also choose which shortcut you'd like when you press " up , " i mine set calendar . - long battery life : i'm not one spend hours my cell phone , but every day use , this phone great respect its battery life . there times when i forget charge my phone go 2 days without charging it still close fully charged . - camera flash other neat options : you also adjust brightness level , self timer , take multiple shots , 10 different " fun frames , " 5 different colortones like sepia , monochrome ( black white negative . - zoom : you zoom upto x4 . - phonebook : contacts easy access it easy search entries . i like fact you enter multiple numbers under one name . you enter persons home , mobile , fax , office pager number . you also enter alias email address . you assign personalized ring tone picture you categorize your contacts different groups . - voice commands : pressing holding * button , voice command menu appears . it nice feature but not something i often use . - speed dailing : one feature i take advantage speed dailing . it nice only press button instantly connect person . - menu styles : there 2 different menu styles you use . i like nature option which cute animation each subcategory you scroll through . my fiance uses icon style which more simple design . - custom welcome goodbye screen . cons : - video quality poor very pixelated . my phone only holds 2 15-second videos . - despite generous 15 ring tones , it hard finding ringtone doesn't make you want pull your hair out . out 15 ring tones , there only 2 decent ring tones . - antenna : i don't use antenna very often but when i , it hard time staying up very flimsy . - picture quality not best . if you intend taking lot pictures i would recommend investing better picture phone . - not v-cast . - no mp3 player . overall : this cell phone exactly , cell phone make calls . it some additional features like picture taking video organization tools like phonebook planner but it still fairly basic phone .	1
this phone great !!! i love this phone . i no problems this phone all . camera pretty good , it small cute size , it good reception . i would definitely reccomend this phone !!	1
if you cell phone , you need charger . you don't get car charger , but it good idea , if you car . this works well	1
it snapped right , looks great . but sometimes it slip press buttons side your phone . it either make phone not work , or run down battery	1
case fits like glove ! appears high quality rich leather look feel detailed stitching . cover back easy attach not scratch my phone , which i checked removing case . my only complaint i not like small mount back attach carry clip since i never carry my phone my belt . attachment kept my phone laying flat . no problem , if you slide off back cover , take off small foam piece inside , you see tiny screw . just unscrew remove mount . there hole your cover ; if you not like just reapply foam piece . attach back cover phone then fill hole piece felt . looks fantastic . if you clip user , clip clear plastic cheap looking i found it difficult remove phone it . but maybe good thing so it won't fall off accidentally . i cannot comment how well case wear since i only few days . my friends seen it love new look . i chose navy blue case am truly amazed how well case fits phone . awesome !!	1
i like shape plug so it doesn't cover up any other outlets . it works , what else i say	1
$50 bucks you pay here , you get phone plus 300 minutes airtime . that not bad deal considering if you bought phone itself elsewhere , it would $20 bucks , buying airtime separately would also total approximately $20 some odd bucks or so . plus tax . so cost works same . frankly , i see no savings buying this phone this site versus elsewhere . regarding sim card , i noticed nothing unusual or problematic insertion . sim card delicate silicon apparatus highly susceptible esd -electro static discharge- just like computer ram . esd probably primary reason why so many reviewers phones here failed . i'd bet every single one them reside geographical locations where weather cold snows . before you handle sim card , you should " ground " yourself touching something metal . otherwise you run risk destroying sim card esd . phone itself ok . it basic . emphasis basic . i just transferred my mobile # motorola v120c notwithstanding annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones c139 , only edge c139 over v120c color display . please also note c139 not any kind interface pc so means you stuck bundled ringtones wallpaper . imo , motorola could added port accomodate usb interface this model . it short-sighted just dumb not considering v120c -also same price range- such port . voicemail extremely problematic set up this time . i only just phone activated this past saturday ( 10/28/06 ) it took over 5 hours my number transferred over new phone . also , it entirely new network . southern california , network this model tracfone uses cingular . suffice it say , i followed all instructions website explicitly , however cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message it doesn't recognize my number input my voicemail number . around around it goes . i anticipate nothing but problems " technical support " when i contact them . they very polite customer service reps , however they barely speak or understand english . i am envisioning hours bs call i make because past experience indicated me these reps not technical whatsoever . note tracfone : customer service reps mexico who barely communicate your american consumers most assuredly not tech support . also , i wasn't overly impressed keypad where it concerns text messaging . v120c actually more intuitive . it much easier use . but c139 one advantage this regard - text messages cost only 0.3 units versus v120c , tracfone deducting 0.5 units each incoming outgoing text message . i'm not sure why considering deduction units zip model phone . it should one uniform deduction across board . consumers should contact tracfone customer service inquire this phenomenon . bottom line i would recommend this phone anyone who upgrading monochromatic led phone wants * inexpensive * phone much easier eyes color display . inexpensive you bought it retailer $20 bucks . but if you want pretty new ringtones wallpaper , little more flexibility , then get yourself nokia 2126 . same money you spend here , nokia better phone . it usb port , speakerphone , plus other extras . you probably won't any trouble setting up voicemail either .	1
my tracfone good reception . i like it free call waiting free caller id . if you haven't activated your tracfone yet then ' refer friend program ' give each us 100 free minutes . please send me email i send you fast referral . it win/win ! thanks	1
after two no-brand aftermarket cables which invisible phone nokia phone suite , this cable included software driver worked perfectly . ( note : nokia phone suite must separately downloaded , but free charge . ) we uploaded photographs our nokia 6102i our computer added phone numbers computer keyboard phone . nokia gone pains ensure you buy expensive cable . i recommend pricing accessories before selecting your next phone . some motorola phones accept universal mini-usb cable which i believe cheaper	1
careful - amazon identifies this phone gsm 850mhz . it not . read ' vital statistics ' section full write up you see no mention 850mhz . check sony web page ( other people who sell this phone ) you see it not work 850mhz . i don't own this phone but researching it friend when i discovered this discrepancy . i gave it 4 stars because cool magic mirror case - i no idea if this phone really good or not	1
i bought this phone part sprint/nextel sero plan . i used it 14 days before deciding it didn't fit my needs several reasons outlined below : - battery life sporadic -- i got maybe day worth power it . one time it completely discharged overnight . price phone ( two year contract it carries ) this dealbreaker . - nextel network coverage gone downhill my area ( i former nextel subscriber 3 years - so i some experience coverage around town ) . i getting disconnects sporadic no signals . - phone would sporadically mute ringer . incoming call would light up display but there would no ringing . this seems happen after i put phone vibrate then turned it back ring . - same monthly service fee , i getting less access web services no high speed internet ability . admittedly high speed access not useful tiny screen -- but if i'm going locked into 2 year contract i would like some fast internet access phone . i880 still uses slow nextel data network . i not direct connect/walkie talkie user . if i , then my opinion this phone might little higher ( since nextel presently arguably best fully functioning walkie talkie network ) . i could not justify locked into 2 year contract equipment seemed sub-par network not ( likely never ) support latest high speed technologies . below my initial impressions during time i used phone : thankfully motorola designed phone so micro-sd card accessible outside -- no need pull battery update card . here big things i don't like . 1 . you cannot use any mp3 songs you transfer micro-sd card ringtones . 2 . you also cannot readily load additional wallpapers unless it picture you took phone or paid download . any message ( mms ) you send yourself only set caller id image not wallpaper . 3 . battery life my phone flaky - i'm getting maybe day one-half usage approximates 60 minutes talk time perhaps 6 10 picture messages . you must pay nextel download ringtones . there some users who modified phone reportedly able use ringtones off their micro-sd memory card - however process more technical than what your average user might want tangle . note : sprint nextel both owned same company . if you're making decision sprint vs . nextel , there only couple reasons i think recommend nextel over sprint . first , if nextel coverage better . second , if you need use nextel walkie talkie feature . sprint side company features phones significantly enhanced web browsing higher speed data communications . nextel side clings larger phones aims their services industrial/construction market . almost every consumer , sprint side better deal . sprint my experience better customer service whereas nextel tends transfer you endlessly among variety customer service representatives . here my summary this phone after using it two weeks : good : -beautiful speaker phone-compact design / solid feel-2 megapixel camera , ability capture movies-flip swings open when you push button-nextel sms/mms messages now auto-downloaded - i believe this first nextel phone sport this feature-nice loud audio-both nextel walkie talkie directalk supportthe bad:-can't play ringtones off micro sd or via any other non-nextel transfer ( note : technically some people using motorola product called webjal make transfers cable - but this may more technical than average user would like tackle)-nextel my opinion their way out carrier , soon completely assimilated into sprint side things . while not entirely unexpected , it means nextel plans features not attractive non-construction users ( nextel core group ) . if you want mobile mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versus most sprint plans which include them . nextel doesn't super fast data speeds or network web browsing competing carriers . most web browsing nextel limited character based wap sites both crawl speedwise present unexciting character based screens . -the phone little bigger what some grown accustomed . -while not phone related , some users larger cities reported iden system nearing capactity lot busy signals . -i am only getting day battery life - which extremely low .	1
i very happy see amazon shipped me palmone brand stylus not some generic . this great deal i'm going order some more . thank	1
great battery , now phone goes way longer without needing recharged	1
excellent sound quality . noise cancellation really works . button headset string lets you automatically place call end call . very nice . works much better more reliably than any bluetooth set i've tried - i've tried almost all them .	1
this case good quality construction fits properly . it solves problem able plug proprietary cord ear phones while still case . two things kept me rating it 5 stars . i prefer magnetic closure velcro which this case uses . i also prefer option phone horizontal my belt which i find less cumbersome while working . fixed belt clip design only allows vertical positioning . this still best optional case if you want use mp3 player feature require use earphones	1
it not rocket science ... it works or it doesn't . device works fine . my only " complaint " cord bit short but lesser concern considering price . short cord only reason it didn't get 5 star rating . it well worth money	1

hi , i just recently purchased this phone . so far these problems . yes you restart device , it get hung , but i don't blame phone , after all it windows mobile 5 it . restart occurred twice me past week , so careful . this phone pretty close perfect . other than fact it windows , 3g connection crazy fast it amazing . if you take this phone ready take good data connect plan even thought it wifi capabilities , cingular programed it first connect their data connect feature .. which return give u nice thick bill .. once you buy phone i suggest you get this software spb pocket plus . it helps shutting down softwares running background , adds more features . screen clarity amazing it great features . it connect up 6 bluetooth devices once . overall i give it 4 because hardware . one star missing cause it windows . sorry microsoft but you need remove bugs outta this windows too .	1

i got this phone 2 weeks back although i seen this my cousin singapore quite sometime back . just right off box , phone quite impressive . many complain response time - yes , this phone slow but doesn't bother me - far better than my windows machine overall , very good phone what it offers . pros : * this phone tops ergonomics , ease use , presentation , features , bluetooth , speakerphone call quality . * wi-fi worth mentioning separately . it simply superb . * nokia connection manager far superior than anyone else market . it handles very efficiently one easily choose several access points save lots money . i accidentally downloaded big chunk data going pay through my nose next month ! * all apps come this phone quite good . * bt sync my apple just fine isync . also i transfer music/themes/ringtones using data cable my wintel . phone automatically toggles " mass storage " mode when it connected pc , which pretty neat . * i haven't faced any such problem i charge my gadgets daily . i also tried leaving it uncharged it comes 2-3 days , good enough my call volumes . * symbian browser fast stunning . bookmarks feature neat . wi-fi feature helps you set all bookmarks while you're home then use it wisely while you away . * camera quality good . dual camera just great idea . camera settings similar professional cameras - very very impressive ! * tried video mode came fine . * battery life , many claim , seems short - but i charge my gadgets daily - so not big issue * headset comes phone really good . * tonnes themes , apps etc available this phone ..... cons * my first biggest problem main navigation key badly designed . it made cheap plastic almost 8 out 10 times i " selected " option when i actually trying navigate left . it so frustrating . * my second biggest problem this phone when slider , screen light not come up . so you won't know - even day - which button press answer question " unlock phone ? " - you get practice but it truly pain . * process taking picture sucks . picture what you see screen when you hear shutter sound not what you get . there serious lag shutter click final image . i sincerely hope if there would some s/w patch this . i am anyway not big fan phone cameras - exception sony ericsson w810i . one far superior camera quality i saw so far . * slider lock unlock feature good bad . i am putting this bad section even if slider opens your pocket , phone could turn end up accidental redialing . so you would need small app locking properly . overall - good phone . this point , nokia better phones like n95 etc - course very expensive .	1
i've this phone year half no problems . it good making calls which really all i ask phone . it easy enough use i even bought one my elderly parents they've no problems . my carrier cingular i've excellent service ny tri-state area because it quad-band phone , i've also able use it while roaming internationally . battery life just okay ( not good my old nokia ) ... i recharge every other day normal use . overall , it lasted me long enough i would call it good value .	1

these javoscreen treo 650 protectors really very different anything you've normally seen . typically , 95% screen protectors very thin material you stick screen , hope against hope you don't bubbles , but you almost always . when screen off , you see bubbles , thankfully when screen , bubbles pretty invisible ..... but these javoscreen protectors completely different animal . they thick , tough , relatively firm . because those properties , they go no bubbles , they easily moveable ( adjustable ) should you not get it perfectly first time . further , they come little squeegee thingy make sure its there good . this state art screen protectors . this all becomes even bigger issue men , because whiskers , over time screen get dulled scratched . because thickness quality these , scratches screen no longer issue .	1

pros : - best pictures yet ( 3.2 mega pixels ) cell phone i used - built flash ( rare cell cameras ) - cover over lens camera - good music player - expandable memory sony m2 flash memory - fm radio - bluetooth works great - screen great size wonderful resolution - edge device makes internet data fairly quick usable pc modem ( via bluetooth)cons : - keys small difficult press - camera lens cover needs lock switch ( mine opens just walking around takes pictures lint my pocket ) - very annoying - sleep timer bit quick should adjustable - i shouldn't expect it thinner since it size very small digital camera but i'd still like it slimmer .	1
product delivered timely manner functions properly	1
i used carry my treo 600 original case came device . but soon , i found out original case kind loose my treo fell out it once . luckily , it carpet so no damage ( least no visual damage ) . after incident , i started looking better case , this one what i found . what i say , you don't know how bulky treo until you wear one your belt . case its job - it provide nice secure protection treo it allows you clip your belt sideway so you don't carry it around your hand or you pocket ( which barely fit ) . but treo quite heavy it thick , so you definitely aware your treo hanging your belt . sometime , i just feel like it too much burden i want get it off me . but overall , i still prefer this than original case . , heaviness not this case fault , should blame handspring ( now palmone ) not making it lighter ... : -	1

this great phone i've used year now . i'd like highlight standout features make this phone unique , especially its price . mp3 player . just get adapter usb port ( few bucks ebay ) you plug your stereo headphones . too bad they haven't offered update motorola digital audio player . microsd slot . you take microsd card , put it into included adapter plug into sd slot your computer copy mp3s ( you take any mp3 make it your ringtone , cropping it make it more effective ) , 3gp videos ( animation looks great , but sound slightly out sync , search web video converters convert your content ) , or pictures . i love making my own ringtones not buy them . bluetooth . i got explorer 320 headset $20 it works great it . battery . easily exchangeable . easily slide off cover pop fresh one . battery life isn't very long , so it good spare battery , they're cheap . video camera . not high quality video , but its something old razr couldn't . customization . i love customization . you set up hotkey side phone , two top keypad , directional pad go directly most functions phone . it even shortcut list list all your favorite features . you easily make any picture including pics you take into your wallpaper . also you find replacement faceplates make your phone unique . speakerphone . works even when closed . good using automated phone menu systems when you're put hold . speaker loud great ringtones mp3s . plastic may resonate certain sounds though . vibrating alert . vibe then ring ! why doesn't every phone this ?? it should default standard all phones . vibration definitely strong enough feel pocket . if you one show off your ringtone , let it move onto ring , otherwise descreet answer immediately . ----------------------------------------------------------- what i don't like . i don't care much motorola menu style . i prefer sanyo samsung interfaces . menu same razr or slvr . all lettering outside well some case paint rubbed off . i carry my phone my pocket so phone aged bit . i scraped off remainder lettering so it wouldn't look half worn off . ----------------------------------------------------------- all great features what keeps me getting samsung t509 or other more expensive phones . this phone just all fee-free features you could want	1

i used i530 little over two years no problems unit , or nextel service . simplify your reading , here list pros cons . cons : little chunky ; lacks up date features tech ( such color screen , external display , etc . ) ; battery life nothing write home . pros : durability ( dropped off roof , still going strong ); looks ( yellow model ); call quality excellent ; good speakerphone ; digital 2-way great feature . overall , i am very satisfied my i530 . only issue among cons any real concern battery life , but this characteristic most nextel phones - perhaps due nature iden network which they operate . even after two years , my original battery lasts more than day moderate use . pain ? slightly , but given advantages nextel , its worth remembering charge up more often . please beware several overly negative reviews nextel posted below - my experience their coverage , customer service , etc . very positive . just make sure you your homework respect coverage before you sign up any wireless company . go one gives best coverage areas which you live , work , or travel . it always best actually put printed coverage maps test real phone . some providers overly optimistic . nextel maps pretty legit , least far i discovered	1
what i say ? it works very well - i keep this my car so when i travel i don't worry my palm tx batteries	1
i i850 , but i560 what my wife using 3 months . phone so good , my 2 year old can't destroy it ! ( he tried ) there only 3 things i don't like it : it doesn't very big screen , external screen isn't color , it no camera . other than it pretty much same higher priced models like i850 ... holding them together i suspect they fact same electronics inside , minus 3 things i mentioned above . if you don't take pic this really phone you ! you even submerge this thing water , it still work without needing anything special ! it gps built , all java apps . it everything higher priced models minus camera smaller screen . even though screen smaller , it color , very legible	1

samsung a900 great phone - motorola razr steroids . ( , it much more durable than razr . ) but battery life awful !!! you literally charge this phone least two times per day get any real talk time . not any more ! bargaincell price so low , i skeptical . perish thought ! i got battery time ; it very well packaged . it fit phone perfectly , cover it came . i plugged it let it charge completely . i then used phone three days without recharge ! whoo hoo !!!! bravo bargaincell ! way - even though this somewhat " thick " battery , it surprisingly unobtrusive : it not add " bulk " you might think , looking its picture . fact , i think phone actually looks better larger battery . i leather bytech carry case designed razr/a900 . it tight fit now , but i'm sure case stretch much like new shoe after it worn few days . not hesitate buy one these batteries !!	1
i gone through several smartphones past 4 months ( including , cingular htc 8125 , nokia e62 ) safely say this best phone i owned . palm operating system much easier use than windows operating system ( albeit , less powerful ) much more customizable synchronization-friendly than symbian os . its great easy installation software . pros : - very customizable interface , making phone very user friendly . you set any application or any number dial preset button . - palm os easy use , thus , you actually get take advantage many features phone , unlike windows mobile , which definantly more powerful than palm os , but cumbersome difficult use times . - you use this one handed phone ... very important people like me who like drive text/email . - perfect size , weight feel phone your hand your ear . lack antennae stub this model huge aesthetic improvement . - easy synchronization your outlook mailbox or palm desktop - set phone automatically retrieve your emails alert you , which very useful ( although limits battery life ) cons : - battery life somewhat worse than other phones . i charge my phone every night , i probably use 15 minutes internet , 30 minutes mp3 player , autoretrieve email every 30 min , 2 hour talk time well some other palm functions . if you it set auto-retrieve your email , battery life seems decrease impressively . newer manufactured 680s fix installed this problem apparently . - you cant plug your own headsets into device ( like your ipod headphones ) you use specific headphone fits you get it palm . i hate . i suggest buying this phone unlocked palm , instead cingular . i got it 350$ 1g sd card stereo headphones included . also , if you get it cingular , they always ruin look phone plastering their logo all over both sides phone . overall : extremely satisfied this easy use , highly customizable , powerful smartphone , despite somewhat shorter battery life .	1
i needed bluetooth headset because all driving i traffic but i didn't want look like dork some giant blinking contraption sticking out my ear . i took chance this headset even though i read review saying it didn't sync up well vx8300 . i couldn't more happy . even though it small(about 1-1/2 " ) buttons still large enough use ease . it also fits snug comfortabe my ear works well my vx8300 .	1

this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1
overall i'm happy skin . it fits treo 700 very closely . this custom formed every curve , bump , button treo . my one complaint they advertise it compatible 700w 700p . i should paid more attention pictures thought it . 700w , if you don't know , almost identical except buttons just below screen . button layout same , but they different icons purposes . well , skin images button covers 700w , not 700p . not huge deal , just slight annoyance . i'm going see if there way remove these somehow	1

this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1
overall i'm happy skin . it fits treo 700 very closely . this custom formed every curve , bump , button treo . my one complaint they advertise it compatible 700w 700p . i should paid more attention pictures thought it . 700w , if you don't know , almost identical except buttons just below screen . button layout same , but they different icons purposes . well , skin images button covers 700w , not 700p . not huge deal , just slight annoyance . i'm going see if there way remove these somehow	1
great price vs buying it your cell phone company	1
this case made l6 . l2 uses same case , so they both fit within this rubber case . however , keys laid out differently l6 - so this case grooves slightly off keys . i didn't give it low rating , because it well built actually really great product - just wanted give other l2 owners warning . it works well , but it just little funky l2 , but totally usable . price , you just can't beat it - it much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out your pocket	1
works great , its bit bigger than some headsets , but this case i feel thats good thing , microphone lot better job filtering out background noise you don't get feedback loop where person you're talking hears themself since mic futher away speaker . only complaint would i wish volume went up just bit more , it hard hear people sometimes while driving freeway if they talk too quietly . one note anyone buying one ... hole plug charger into under thing holds it onto your ear , it rotates out way . it took me awhile find it when i first got it	1
my first blackberry i love it ! i wanted stop lugging around phone rather heavy dell axim just contacts , calendar task-to-do list . i wanted phone synched outlook great phone . pearl definitely best choice . i didn't really care internet , music or camera , but cheapest $30 internet plan cingular lets me unlmited internet access home email instantly - it just great ! i bought $40 1gb card now 150 mp3 songs pictures it . i use mp3 songs ringtones it great able instantly recognize who calling music . camera ok - not great , but ok very nice on-the-spot photos you don't want lug around regular digital . i actually emailed picture spot - very cool . battery life phenomenal so far . however , i'm not heavy user i used profiles phone automatically shut off 2am 6am every day . only cons so far : 1 ) getting used keypad - believe what every one says intuitiveness keypad figuring out correct word . i've followed other folks ' advice don't really look words letter letter - i type sentence then look - it works like charm 9 times out 10 keyboard correctly identifies each word . still , this type entry so different first time blackberry user , but getting used this still better than using stylus touch screen like axim . 2 ) also trouble restart if i change ringtone someone - i reseat battery get change take effect . hmmm ... 3 ) volume when talking , even speakerphone , average - not terrible , but ok . so far , my reception fine . 4 ) i also wonder how long track ball last - i'm not heavy user i still use it constantly . i think i'm going buy insurance plan just case . these minor cons far outweighed simply great phone synchs outlook so very much more . bye bye dell axim . it true what some say - i'm " crackberry " because playing this thing addictive . i'll update this review again 3 months or so , but i don't anticipate any problems . my only regret i didn't hold out until red pearl came stock my local cingular kiosk . i would honestly give this phone 4.5 out 5 stars if they let you	1
i just recently bought blackberry pearl i love device . its stylish , beautiful , small , it some awsome features . however , since i bought it amazon , cingular took forever just approve me give me new number . so i constantly call amazon ask them my order . then i receive phone almost week later than day i placed my order i follow instructions my phone didn't want work . so representatives told me there something wrong my sim card ... when it wasn't . luckily i called cingular very helpful representative helped me set up my account actually service when amazon told me there something wrong my sim card lol . overall , amazon should more careful how they describe their phone activation process because it wasn't easy . but whatever i love shopping @ amazon i truly love my phone i bet you love it too . :) !!	1
i palm 650 two years . it few issues , but generaly speaking it worked well . unfortunately one my big concerns phone size . when i first bought it , i not think it woud big deal . but after it while , it felt like i carring brick my packet ( if you smart phone user , then you know what i am talking . ) i wanted switch phones but all smart phones market same disadvantage good but huge size . i debating bjack when i discovered pearl . first i thought it would not same capabilities palm , , or bjack ; but i it 3 months now tell truth , there so many advantages this phone i not miss my palm all . pearl not only not flaws palm , but also same ( or more ) capabilities browsing speed . trackball works way better than touchscreen . so far i am very happy my purchase i am glad i got pearl not or bjack . best part i finally feel i am carring phone not brick my packet . not sure it ? then not believe me ; simply check reviews all smarth phones online . you surprised find pearl gets usually higher grades than most other smart phones	1

i bought this little phone 8 months ago am truly pleased it . i don't use it every day , or even every week . i got it keep me when i'm driving those inevitable times when something goes wrong you need phone right now . it paid me more peace mind than it could ever cost dollars . what i like phone itself it very small light easily tucked inside pockets or small bags . it charges fully very short time , under two hours first time out box under hour after . it holds charge very long time i just found out recently . driving appointment i running late needed call let them know . i'd forgotten recharge phone over 2 months expected it dead doornail . my delight it turned right i made call no problems . can't beat . virgin prepay plan perfect users like me ends up costing $6 month . tell me there something better i'll say prove it . i looked long hard find best possibility this it . i think it still . nice , dependable " insurance " type phone , i couldn't more pleased genuinely recommend it .	1

this phone great corporate phone . it best windows mobile phone currently available , my oppinion . they overlooked few features : -there no lcd light tell you its charging status - instead screen all time . -there no way know when num lock key - so you just press number key see what comes up . -in order unlock phone , you press on/off button top phone , which not very convenient location . -the track wheel feels pretty cheep	1
i used seidio rubberized case before this . it thinner pearl barely noticed pocket . this case 1/2 inch wider thicker , but it protects phone all sides except top . phone slips out effortlessly . it looks great , magnet puts it sleep , which nice . even though it bit more bulky i can't go back seidio because protection looks . i just use screen protector , but many use best skins ever it no problem . it also pretty cheap ($15 ) . less than seidio other pouches out there .	1

i've treo 650 long time . i wasn't 100% sure i'd want 680 , when it first announced , but big nasty scratch my 650 screen helped me decide take plunge . i'm so glad i . lack protruding antenna makes it fit my pocket much better , internal slot sim card eliminates my worry it might get lost , covered sd card slot very welcome , because darned thing always popped out my 650 . only thing lost 650 reset button . reset 680 , you take out battery . that not big deal , since even 650 , you remove battery cover get reset switch . what better 650 ? main thing me cell phone radio slightly more sensitive it take 8gb sd cards ( sdhc ) . i use this phone everything , since it also great palm organizer . addition , i've installed registered version pocket tunes , so it very good mp3 player . it even compatible playsforsure , if you're into . that why i'm so happy see 8gb support . i also use phone play games , like monopoly scrabble , when i'm waiting line or boring meeting . i absolutely zero complaints this phone .	1
pros : pda , good mobile phone really gets out , camera all those ' kodak moments ' , all packed one good pricethe cons : you'll need get replacement longer life battery ( seidio makes one ) , browser ( blazer ) many problems . i'm very happy purchase this smartphone . i've wanted treo few years but could never justify spending big bucks one . you work around problems unit new battery browser software , it nice little phone . i haven't bought memory card it , so i can't report mp3 capabilities , but i am going direction . somehow i don't think it replace my ipod , but you never know	1

i can't believe technology advanced it , samsung could produce this giant pos . it flashy , yes . but it deliver ?? no . i actually refused pay bill let them shut my service off . i loved clarity pictures , even though 1 megapixel camera pretty lousy , i even liked video feature . but phone only good if you use it !!! it years since i've such lousy reception phone . i'm considering taking dealer court over this , since they pushed it me told me what great phone it . i want my money back !!	-1

i bought these use my ipod earbuds . i old pair ( they green ) worked great , but i lost one . within minutes putting them earbuds , they split open - all three pairs ! if you're planning using these your ipod headphones , look into older colored ones - i believe they're different material less prone cracking	-1
i ear gels before , but none this cheap ( i don't mean cost ! ) . there no consistency size ( they come different sizes , but no two same ) . without fail , every single one i tried use split half after installed ear piece . every one ! it didn't seem matter if they small or larger -- or even larger than ear piece . material just began tearing both sides ended up falling off ever instance . i am sure there must better quality version these things somewhere . i seriously not recommend these anyone	-1

i got this phone basically free , but even taking into account , i'm pretty disappointed phone . this my first samsung , i'm pretty sure , my last one ! i owned nokia before i regret i " betrayed " it . now i wouldn't get anything besides nokia worst case maybe sony-ericsson . so here short list those " little things " make your life , this phone ( it combination t-mobile ) , annoying : - keys not comfortable use . - it not really comfortable open/close slider make it easier you put your thumb screen which leaves greasy all time . - putting comma , while writing text message , capitalizes next word - what logic ?! ( it annoys me because i use text messages lot)- you can't set camera shutter silent ... - you only save 1 phone type each category - what if person 2 business phones ... - you cannot choose e-mail address person contact list when you want send picture message e-mail address . there lot more those little illogical things just not thought through , like it would've nokia ( even model 5 years old ! )oh yeah , t-mobile really " contributed " " greatness " this phone , removing some features limiting others , like setting your mp3 ringtone ( although , there easy hack around it : just change extension . mp3 . 3gp	-1
i bought this $30 best buy . what waste money ! ear gels comfortable first , but after hour or so , your ear starts really hurt i t.t he sound quality terrible ! people i am talking sound very muddled overly loud , even lowest volume setting my motorola v300 . what worse , people i am talking hear me very poorly . they say there so much background noise it sounds like i am noisy bar , even when i'm just sitting my car . people barely hear me over background noise racket	-1

useless piece junk . worked 3 minutes then broke . since bought motorola-brand one three times what i paid this piece junk . not attracted cheap price tag , because you get what you pay ( or what you dont pay this case ) .	-1
product description should state it not work verizon v3c ! when plugged , it states " unauthorized charger " not charge all ( although , if battery dead , it give you enough juice speak , but it still won't charge (?)) .	-1
service good but product didn't enough info me make wise decision . end i couldn't use product my jabra ear piece . item description should information compatible ear sets help make better purchasing choice	-1
others mentioned , front window blanks out almost immediately , even worse , it doesn't show your missed calls . you open phone . stupid design . it not any exterior lights , such my old samsung , showed when it charging , when charge completed , when voice mail waiting , etc . this phone needs opened get any info . can't even see time without opening phone . while talking phone it blacks out after 1 minute . i don't like either . it also very hard hear it . especially if car , traffic noise . no , i'm not driving , but i'm passenger trying use my phone . forget it . re color someone mentioned . cingular light pastel pink , tmobile magenta ( dark pink ) . one thing i like this phone quad band , if you travel interationally , it great . i just got phone , so haven't used it interational yet . oh , it must tmobile get international service . phone camera , plus other tech features , but i don't use them . i want my phone only phone , no other gadgets . i would never buy this phone again , soon i'm eligible upgrade this phone history . i doubt i would get motorola ever again , i'll stick samsung .	-1
whereas body glove cosmetically looks good , it diabolical flaw inherent its poor design . attachment button mounted rear glove allows quick engagement disengagement belt clip seriously defective . plastic button resides small pocket sewn into rear glove . problem button flange holds button connector glove floating inside rubber elastic glove . pocket stretches ! soon any pressure applied phone when it hanging your belt ( like when you sit down or bump anything ) , connector easily ( silently ) dislodges its elastic pocket !!! your valuable cell phone drops ground you lost it ! you lost your phone but button still attached your belt clip . this dreadfully constructed device designer should ashamed . use this glove your own peril	-1

skin great idea , but it not practical . it too thick work seidio cradle i , so i must pull off skin sync my treo . skin buttons not always line up treo buttons , so i misfire applications . holster joke it snaps over top expansion card slot constantly ejecting card every time i pull phone off holster . not place phone your pocket skin unless you need see inside your pocket liner it not come out cleanly	-1

excellent high-res lcd , but rest phone disappointment . poor overall interface configuration options non-intuitive locations . particularly disappointing how it handled wifi . each application seemed want tied particular wireless source . so , i'd go home try get it wireless , but i'd bring up app , let it spin while , told it couldn't connect , then i'd tell it use local wifi . it just clunky . poor utility things like wifi mean this unlikely used anything beyond phone , very expensive bulky one . i check respond email far faster my blackberry than i could get this thing get appication running connected via wifi . much better wifi management must before i'd consider this phone . this serious example one device trying everything , doing nothing very well . device relatively nice , but i gave it two stars because $500 price tag means it deliver . i bought quickly returned phone	-1

hi , before buying this phone amazon , i called palm they told me there would 1 year warranty this item long it new . i subsequently bought this unlocked version phone i am using it t-mobile network . i now problem display within 2 months purchase . i call palm after multiple run arounds tech support , they asked me read out my serial number . it starts haga which , they indicate , means it att wireless network . according them , i am violation warranty since i am using it t-mobile network . how am i know what serial number back phone means prior my purchase ? if i am purchasing gsm unlocked phone , obviously i need flexibility move different network . palm taking easy way out - they want you buy unlocked phone their site not amazon . amazon , itself , not provide any warranty . if any you better luck palm or any suggestions - please let me know . thank	-1

advantages : 1 ) superior protection : i dropped my phone twice onto concrete there no damage phone or case . 2 ) all buttons accessible , though bit difficult get cases . disadvantages : 1 ) signal quality worse when phone case ! 2 ) belt clip useless , since case easily open , spilling out phone when one belt . 3 ) side " ok " button difficult press , same top two front front buttons ( above " start " " ok " buttons ) . summary : usable only protection during transportation , this well . phone should removed case during usage	-1
same comments latch opening easily . my complaint belt clip - it made inexpensive plastic broke off after two days mild use . wouldn't buy again	-1

i've silicone case my treo 650 long time . it thin rubber very grippy ( great anti-slip)- once i left my treo top my car ( not recommended ) drove 10 miles , case so grippy phone still top when i arrived ! after it finally broke i ordered this one replace it . rubber boxwave case much thicker than my original case , so much so it difficult use 5-way navigator without it doing what i didn't want it . case not nearly grippy slides off my car seat , unlike original . boxwave offers full refunds if product defecive- since this isn't , i probably won't bother . but my opinion , there better products out there	-1

i got hs805 call home while trucking . i sold aaa battery power source , because rechargeable ones won't last 14 hour work shift even then i no 120v outlet recharge . however , i say audio output when adjusted max volume barely audible 18 wheeler highway speeds . wind engine noise much higher than car similar heard 757 35000ft . this reason alone , this headset junk . advertisements criminally overstate talk standby time well . regular new duracell aaa battery , i get low battery tone after 1 hour standby . 900mah duracell rechargeable battery i get only 6 hours standby time before hearing low battery tone . marketing department motorolla , i say great job deceiving misrepresenting inferior product lacks stated function durability . i hope you enjoy earning check based lying people . hint : get job actually contributes society versus fleecing society . you should proud !	-1

i hate this phone . i moved miami cannot get reception anywhere . it cuts me off minute i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside talk . i get land line first time over 5 years because i cannot use it my apartment , so i am wasting tons money land line overpriced long distance rates . but here thing : other people verizon using different brand phone like lg absolutely no problem ! they actually get couple bars reception , whereas i always one or none all . i returned phone all they could give me just like it ... all same problems . i actually over 30 dropped calls one month . i am now stuck it next 2 years unless i want purchase one full price . top , people right when they say battery life ridiculous . unless you never talk it , battery wears out hurry . volume buttons side very hard use when talking . i usually end up putting it speaker phone accident . i am trying decide which lesser two evils .. chucking this one drawer purchasing different one , or wasting money land line . whatever you , don't get suckered it cute pink color , because underneath it pretty exterior it junk	-1
well im 16 [ writing kids review because i dont my own amazon account ] when i first got my pink razr verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink , but now ive it 2 months or so im not so fond it . first off , it takes eight seconds clear home screen , takes forever , phone general slow . also theres obnoxious buzzing earpiece . im stuck this phone while , am not happy it	-1
this very basic holster , often simple best - but not this time . good news : 8700 slips right out ease , swivel works great , clip reasonably secure . minor issue , becuase its plastic , when virbrate " ring " active , it makes annoying rattle sound . real problem 8700 held case two flimsy plastic tabs ( one each side ) . everyday use must weaken plastic , becuase after two months one these tabs broke my case , which meant they 8700 would not stay put . it slipped out fell floor several times . i replaced case , month later , tabs new case broke too . due cheap build quality , i'd suggest you look third-party case options instead this one .	-1
ahhh i see your battery dying . forewarned . i'm betting this doesn't fix problem . i mean really how old your phone ? not old enough yet made this battery tired . li-ion batteries usually last around 18 months ( hence 18mon bunch i-pod users gonna get pissy when i-pod doesn't work anymore you can't change battery . ) why hasn't yours lasted long ... oh because your phone sucks . you like me get new battery it only last 7 hr standby first then drop down 4 hr standby . why ? you noticed yet how hot phone running ? it cooking its internal electronics , your ear , battery . when you get new phone - new one only 90day warranty . t-mobile charge you shipping . you spend least hour them phone . aren't these costs adding up you yet	-1

first pros : clear plastic window designed cover keys well screen , protecting them wear . fit tight so case takes up little additional space my pocket . now cons : dirt debris easily finds its way plastic phone . this actually exacerbates damage dirt grinds plastic phone . plastic screen also attracts dust . when i tried remove phone cleaning , side case ripped . all all , i would not bought this product again . please avoid	-1
if you buying this connect nokia phone beware . it non-nokia part no easily interface nokia software . it uses different chipset than nokia data interface cable , which prevents it using standard nokia drivers . you may able get it working , but i spent four hours not met success . i installed drivers provided . i installed nokia drivers . i even installed pl-2303 serial driver , but i could not make it work . also note this cable serial interface . if converts usb connection your computer into serial port , so you likely not happy data transfer speed . i would recommend against this purchase . spend extra money buy real thing . you'll save yourself some head aches heart aches . god bless you	-1
i impatient buy successor my beloved treo 650 , so last january upgrading treo 680 . i faithful customer palm technology since 1997 , first time , i am disappointed . course , i still friendly palm os , tailor made smart phones . i also upgrade compatibility my 15,000 records stored treo four main applications . but minuscule battery 680 forces me curtail versamail sync phone conversations , its clumsy command bar results unexpected commands ( contrary 650 , buttons too close each other ) . reliability 680 also left desired , especially compared 650 after firmware update . finally , i use intellisync dual sync both user-friendly palm desktop heavy duty email ms outlook ; acquisition pumatech nokia results clumsy new release intellisync treo : intellisync new version added record number " note " field all my records ! i quickly reverted older intellisync version i wonder what happen when i need upgrade ms office 2007 compatibility ... nokia low blow palm ? it time palm responds decent dual sync solution their own . if not , it decided : i switch pearl	-1
i've used palm os going 10 years now . when my treo 270 died , i bought used 270 ebay . eventually one died too i bought unlocked 650 amazon . i called palm " tech support " issues i it ( dial up networking didn't work internal browser t-mobile ) . forgive me saying it , but guy palm support dumb dumb . i got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after ( he insisted my treo 270 never allowed dial up networking internal browser -even though i told him first hand i used it all time- he think i lying him ? ) . he knew nothing phone kept deferring supervisor , constantly keeping me hold it just huge waste time . after few calls like this no resolution i gave up decided return 650 . i then tried t-mobile mda . i uneasy idea switching windows pocketpc but decided give it try . me it huge mistake- pocket pc joke completely unintuitive . they expect you study how use their os order make use its clumsy interface . friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications make it easier use , but c'mon- when you buy phone you expect it work right beginning- i don't want spend time learning installing additional software it work properly . finally , i give up pocket pc ( sold it ebay ) give palm try when i see 680 come out . dialup networking issue no longer problem 680 ( compared 650 ) i buy it unlocked directly palm . overall , it decent phone i just feel way more comfortable palm os over pocket pc . palm customer support still useless , others mentioned , lack standard mini-usb connector simply inexcusable . still , i'm much happier palm-os over pocket pc . i use it , i see battery doesn't seem last very long ( just over 2 hours talktime most ) . i hesitantly call palm support get some flunkie again- i decide cut my losses stop wasting my time their " support " . i'm just going buy second battery second charger keep phone charged . i hate idea making such compromise , but me it lesser two evils . fact palm would release phone such terrible battery life indicative their customer mindset . they just don't care . clunky my windows mda , its battery life least 3 4 times what treo gives me ( even though mda much bigger screen ) . imho smartphone market still going through growing pains- original handspring treo designed good people , when palm bought them out they cashed treo product line but customer oriented mentality handspring went right out window -along any intelligent design evolution treo . most better designed smartphones market ( samsung , motorola , htc wizard ) all made pocket pc because microsoft used it clout take over market . i just wish other manufacturers offered palm-os based smartphones again- this way you'd get intuitive interface palm , without limited palm poorly designed hardware ..... maybe it time i finally give blackberry try .... :	-1
my phone broke after month or so . after spending 30 minutes phone during which time t-mobile continually wanted blame me ( you put it fluorescent light , you put it sun , you drop it , you put it your pocket bend it , you put it your pocket bump into something , you drop it , you break it , you something bad it ) they finally relented agreed send new one oft repeated comment if they determined phone damaged then they would charge me untold sums money . most amusing part conversation went like this : would you like ups ground which take 10 days or ups 3 day which cost $15 ? when i responded ground would fine she said " ok , $9.95 " . i laugh their arrogance .	-1

i've used headset little over year , although plagued disconnects when idle , relatively pleased sound quality . not connected when calls came major annoyance . there no notice when it disconnected . recently plastic ear clip broke i contacted logitech informed , since it over one year warranty , my only option would purchase new headset ; huge price pay piece costs pennies . logitech concern its customers appears nonexistant	-1

i owned one these three months , then it started fall apart . it $30 best buy . i haven't replaced it , $30 * lot * . $10 ? i'm buying two more . i moving 20 mph my bicycle , talking someone , no problems . it far better sound quality than my ' backup ' , which jabra no boom . ear volume adjustable my phone , i'm wondering what phones other reviewers won't let them adjust volume	1
device works fine i don't feel i over paid . sure there better hands free devices out there , but this one reliable .	1
so i bought this thing based amazon reviews saved bundle over local retail cost ( yeah amazon ! ) , but that not why i'm writing this review . i'd like talk performance comfort earboom . eargel thingies designed quite well , three different sizes each ear you're bound find one fits very comfortably . turns out i couldn't find any fit my right ear comfortably extended periods use but found perfect fit my mate other side . my wife exact opposite experience - hopefully our daughter inherit more symmetrical ears ! i hate jogging so can't comment fit during activity but say gels fit suprising well folds your ear boom quite secure when installed . i'd imagine it'd take big hit knock it loose once place . sound quality earbud decent , but i feel earboom lacks some fidelity , especially higher frequencies . normally this not problem , but it sometimes make person you're talking sound like isaac hayes . speaker plently loud lack high frequencies allows you tune into tonal range where us humans tend converse , without voices washed over background noise . gels block appropriate amount external sounds allowing you concentrate discussion hand without impeding your ability hear say ambulance while driving . there small slot gels funnels some external noise your drum , while rest gel fits snug ear blocking out other stray noise paths . i've asked people how i sound thus far feedback positive , my voice comes through loud clear despite boom apparent lack length , reinforcing my belief size doesn't matter . fact , i found mic very sensitive even small sounds . forget talking phone subtly typing keyboard our mouse click surfing - they'll hear every click . example , i my house person other end could hear kids playing pool 40 feet away house windows closed !! yes , mic sensitive . even while driving they could hear when i shifted gears . not it obtrusive other person phone , it just good aware they hear it all . what more say such simple device . form fit function all there i would recommend this product . fact , i just ordered - it makes great gift	-1

i love these eargels . my ears funny shape i can't wear regular earbuds , but when i add these gels , they fit great don't fall out . they block outside noise make sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds . sometimes i need small , sometimes i need medium , depending day , weather , how long i use them . ( i gave large size my boss , he loves them too , so don't say you can't use all sizes , guys .	1
every new gadget imaginable i must report i love this phone because i take pictures make videos ! i loathe charge battery everyday ! perhaps i just got bad battery but i've never charge any phone daily . keep mind i leave my phone 24/7 . maybe i should turn it off . anyone else this same syndrome ? if you're shutterbug like me , you love this phone . i didn't even mention hot pink/magenta color which all gals love . one note caution , if you live hurricane alley like me , you may want carry spare battery just case they don't take down cell phone towers before storm . it may useless locally but you least tell your people you're still among living need money escape carnage	-1

i think this pretty good earpiece ... granted , i've only used one other ( it flimsy little thing came w/ my friend nokia ) , but this one far surpasses one sound quality comfort . where my friend would fall out my ear , this one ( once i got it figured out ) never comes loose . second , listening people my friend , i would turn up sound hear person well , then they sounded muffled distorted ; but my jabra i actually turn down volume my phone they sound crisp clear -- moreso than when i'm not using earpiece . finally , when my friend calls me uses her earpiece , she sounds distant muffled ; i've no complaints people i'm talking using jabra , , fact , my mom said it sounds better when i use earboom than when i don't . ear gels bit hard get used . they oddly shaped ( you see picture ) , there six them total -- three them each ear . lots reviewers complained fit comfort ear gels , while others claim these most comfortable earpieces they've used they fit perfectly ... i honesly say i've both experiences . when i first got this unit earpiece kept falling out everytime i would turn my head : * very * frustrating . i tried pushing it into my ear hard i could , i tried holding it place my hand , but only seemed defeat purpose hands-free earpiece . nothing seemed work . i thinking returning it . i thinking throwing it into traffic i-95 . then one day , somehow , i came realization you sort twist it into your ear -- little poky-out part stuck fold your ear next ear canal ( not fold top your ear ; if you it'll just pop out again) -- then * voila * it stays put . matter o ' fact , it'll stay put so well it'll little bit difficult -- even * painful* -- get out again . i imagine people different ear sizes , different patience levels , lower iqs might different experiences than my own . but all i say once i this little bugger figured out , i golden . i love this thing almost never talk phone without it . admittedly , it bit difficult get into your ear -- i'd say it takes upward 2 seconds get properly ( before you're good practiced it ) , which may not sound like lot , but it long enough not recognize somebody voice or hear first sentence they say , or whatever . * very mild * frustration . but like all things good pleasant , it takes little practice get it just right now i it so i answer phone , slip earboom my ear start conversation without missing beat . fact , i find this earpiece so comfortable i forget it until i go scratch my ear or something ! other complaint i saw here it not compatible nokia phones . fact , it even says right package it not compatible nokia . that funny , i nokia 3589i it works just fine . they make two other models earboom ( one which clearly would not worked my phone ) , both which claim nokia compatible , * neither * those works my phone ! confusing ? yes ! problem it doesn't work * all * nokia phones . while browsing store i noticed ones claimed nokia compatible list phones it works , but it didn't include mine ( it included one , numerically speaking , very close my model : 3590 ); which piqued my curiosity . so i went friendly manager store i he opened two different packages me let me test both them . one them worked , other didn't . strange part it we couldn't see visible difference two units ... then one us noticed one them jack two small black stripes around it ( that this one , if you look closely picture you see them ) , while other one ( one marked nokia compatible ) three . hmmm ... curious . so my advice either know your phone well ( , little book handy ) or ask help before purchasing . all all 4 5 stars . i'd give it 5 stars performance comfort , but take it down notch extended period getting used it confusing packaging . addendum : several months later little piece foam fallen end boom so any sound wind becomes almost unbearably loud person other end ... living windy providence , this bit annoyance . also , while i problem where earpiece would cut out seconds time so i couldn't hear person other end line ( , likewise , they couldn't hear me ) unless i jiggled little jack . this * very * frustrating . ** now , some reason , i'm not problem anymore . i'm not really sure if problem due my phone or earboom . either way , it something buyers should aware	-1

just received it this week . replacing my nokia n90 this model , photos much better ( both optical carl zeiss lenses , but this 3.2 mp vs . 2.0 n90 ) . also , n73 covers all radio bands , making reception my cingular coverage very very strong everywhere ( supposedly two internal antennae ) . n90 lacked one frequency ranges used cingular , so depending city i , i occasionally very spotty coverage . symbian operating system n73 faster than older version n90 , best all , it much more compact than n90 , fits nicely palm my hand my jeans pocket . last , there very smooth operating lense cover back phone , protecting camera lense ( why aren't they all like this ? ) . usual , flash isn't equivalent even moderate digital camera , but otherwise i see this phone best both worlds .	1

i am love ... my phone ! i know sounds absurd , but it true . originally , i suggested friend upgrade their handset getting this one ; seeing how i already so motorola v3t . ironically after displeased 2 different motorola v3t razr handsets ( both them freeze startup ) , i called customer service told ' em i wanted this handset instead . minor contract extension/handset upgrade , i glad i made switch nokia . i've only it 24 hours i'm totally satisfied it . below list " pro con " you consider : pros : - bright visible lcd screen . - mp3-ringtones enabled ( make sure cut your tracks 25 seconds if doing so ) . - video ringers . - pretty fast charge , even while messing around it . - bluetooth infrared-enabled making quick file transfers . - dialing keypad raised easy input . - date enabled screen ( which v3t lacks ) . - comes " headphone jack adapter " which enables use any standard headphone you may . cons : - vibrate functionality disabled handset charges ( default ) . - power button somewhat small difficult execute . - fm radio plays static ( this may varies area ) . you see , pro outweight con this one , so give it try . also , if you decide it not you , return it t-mobile within 14 business days your purchase get full refund . me , i won't returning it because it definitely keeper ! :	-1
i purchased this nokia 5300 black t-mobile store . it come 1 gb memory card i able easily load up 160 songs last night no problems . phone comes usb cable connect your computer . i mac so this easy . you not able download songs bought itunes but you load up aac files mp3 mp4 . you hold up 500 songs if they all 3.5 minutes long compressed 128 kps . my music usually remixed and/or longer than 3.5 minutes each . i wasn't able sync up bluetooth my ibook but i able pair my motorola t305 i using my car . apple not approved nokia 5300 yet sync . i am sure it matter time since phone rather new . overall , i love feel this phone , wonderful 2 screen , color great , camera cool , it very intuitive use . i samsung over last three years i concerned going back nokia . however , speakerphone absolutely great compared motorola 195 i originally got but returned . once you load up your songs , speaker impressive . this morning , i phone playing music one part house , i go get something other end house , i could still hear music perfectly . calling phone better than expected . i talking my friend during busy traffic lots people/background noise i able carry pleasant conversation her unlike my samsung difficult this . phone quite sturdy . i am happy phone not everyone - motorola razor . this nokia 5300 looks bit chucky compared phone but i feel like i very unique phone more than phone . who needs ipod mini when you get this your phone all one ? i just ordered boxwave frost case this phone . there very little chose t-mobile store far accessories nokia.com didn't much either . ***** alarm feature wake up cool too . you choose wake up your favorite song you downloaded you program it slowly increase volume song your alarm . it also comes programmable snooze . what dream ! *****you make calls without even slide phone dial . long you number you want already stored your phone book , then all you look up press green button ! ***** when you playing your music , if incoming call comes , it stop playing song then alert you normal ring tone call coming . once you phone call , you resume playing your music . ***** i said , this phone gem all areas - speaker , sturdy , colorful , i think it contemporary acquired taste sure but nonetheless appealing , call quality great even loud areas , lots little creature comforts . definitely consider this phone if you really like music bluetooth speakerphone . else , this may not phone you	-1

i this phone ( virgin mobile pay you go service ) only day or two , but i wanted write this review before i forget . i'll update it if i change my mind . once you get over industrial strength plastic clamshell monster it comes , it good ride . phone resembles small remote control . it sleek unassuming . turn it things get bit zany animations color screen , but it pleasant experience . sound quality good both ends conversation . it attractive . it works . it seems real no-brainer given other choices virgin mobile service . you fun it or just ignore fun stuff -- but you'll get used funny graphics . ui totally intuitive . you interact menus screen few keys below it if you've doing it while after only setting up your preferences . one thing : this whole service software this phone marketed younger demographic than mine ( thirties ) . while it good basic cell phone plan appealing ( pay you go -- me 18c/min ) , there ton stuff play if your train gets stuck tunnel . i lily tomlin operator character answering my voicemail found wallpaper my first name spelled out diamonds ; if i should ever receive text message , among my canned response options ( come standard phone ) " hell no , " " can't talk , " " leave me alone .

speck rubber case best case i've found my blackberry 7290 . said , it not ideal i'd make few changes . pros -- protects case well ; no screen scratches ; minimizes accidental keystrokes while your bag ; no need use belt clip ( most women prefer purses/totebags belt clips ! ) ; i love fact you easily see whether you new messages ( no need take it out case addition taking it out your purse or totebag ) . cons -- clear case collects dirt ; screen cover slightly opaque requires greater use backlight ; screen cover doesn't fit squarely into rubber case ; screen cover gets scratches it , making screen harder read . i get lot compliments this case , it different enough noticed , people envious my ability quickly check messages without fumble opening closing case . however , because cons , i suspect i'll need replace this case more than once year . but i like it enough i'll pay $35 so . maybe next version some improvements . meantime , i feel like i'm getting my money worth out it .	-1

this samsung most reliable phone i've ever . i've it two years , dropped it numerous times , it still going strong only few scratches . battery life declined during this period time , but it still lasts two days before charging . while it not many features new phones out now , i am impressed how many applications i use daily - alarm clock , scheduler , memo pad , etc . reception usually good too . all honesty though , camera not terribly great . pictures tend weird color tint when you transfer them your computer often blurry . i still enjoy camera , if only fact you fiddle options ( black white , brightness , flash , etc . ) make pictures look decent . video option rather lame though , footage choppy you can't even transfer or send it anything . recently when i shuttle , two girls , both razors , saw my phone exclaimed they used it well . both said they missed it liked it better than their new phones . i am supposed getting new phone too , but i know i keeping this one back up . if you looking decent relatively cheap phone , this good one	1

consumer reports correctly deemed samsung wep200 bluetooth headset best . i hear my callers while driving they hear me . samsung also extremely small discrete headset , so you won't look like cheesy phone operator while driving your car . if you want one " those " people who use their bluetooths while walking around public places , it small enough where people really wonder if you're crazy person talking yourself . gimme break ! samsung also comes cool carrying case doubles charger . this super handy since headset so small would easy lose or damage if not sturdy ( but not all bulky ) carrying case . samsung first bluetooth headset i not quickly return due poor headset volume . i returned my lg nokia bluetooths after my first few drives my car . i simply could not hear people whom i talking . samsung first provide enough volume . i'm still happy it after two months ownership . samsung also approximately $35 cheaper amazon than best buy or other retailers , whether online or person . so buy it amazon retailers . only reason i gave samsung four stars not five because short talk time because it not stay your ear while running . i learned this one morning when i late work ran my car my office . samsung quickly began fall out my ear . if samsung short talk time not concern you , then i doubt there too many other bluetooth headsets this price range provide better performance such extremely small package	-1

this wonderful device . build quality typical htc , meaning very good . call quality good provided you're decent service area ( system not overloaded amr-hr kicking ) . scroll wheel very useful addition hermes line makes one handed use much more manageable . slide out keyboard easy use provides very good tactile feedback . there huge user community very large knowledge base consult ( this perhaps ultimate " geek " phone ) . wm5 rom it currently ships fairly stable provides usual suite applications productivity tools . there learning curve involved windows mobile , but imho it not nearly so bad some ppl make it out . general , things work they supposed this phone . one drawback while device support bluetooth a2dp profile ( stereo bluetooth sound ) , microsoft bluetooth stack found this device horrible . phone ships a2dp forced mono , which means you'll manually edit registry enable true stereo sound over bluetooth . bluetooth stereo sound also set very low quality , which also involves series registry tweaks improve . even after all , there still exists audible inaccuracies artifacts audio . other words , don't waste your money set stereo bluetooth headphones if you take your audio seriously . however , bluetooth work very reliably most regular ( mono/one ear ) bt headsets ( i recommend jawbone ) , call voice quality experienced call these devices perfectly acceptable . audio related drawback this device : there not even 2.5 mm stereo jack . only physical audio out through htc proprietary jack which also power data jack . saving grace here earbuds unit ships actually passable , also availability htc-to- 3.5 mm jack adapters market . even few shortcomings , i would remiss not point out this probably best pocketpc phone us carrier subsidized market . it packs incredible amount power into remarkably usable form factor . if you're need windows mobile device fan slide out qwerty keyboard instead dedicated keyboard devices , this your phone	-1

i've this phone week . i'm using it t-mobile , so your mileage may vary . my opinion , it feature-packed phone reasonable price ( unlocked smart phone , least ) . symbian 9 os runs pretty well , although i experience some lags software freezes ( third-party apps ) . fixing it matter rebooting . i think menu organization could smarter , but you customize much it . i love default screen displays your day calendar agenda . but screen hides main menu . not huge drawback , but it confused me first . photos 3-megapixel camera grainy ( it also vga camera ) . since this phone first , not camera , there also no stabilization control . it , however , come flash . sound quality phone calls okay . your friends , family colleagues hear you clearly . your end , however , it sound like you're talking cell phone . it not bad , but i've conversations better sounding phones . i disagree slightly commenter wireless internet ( wlan ) access . it possible set default access point . problem if you aren't location regularly , you search new network . one way around it pony up cash data plan through your wireless provider . i agree , however some kind one-button auto-detect would ideal . i don't like sim card slot . metal cover pops off fairly easily -- i found out while trying insert my sim card without reading manual first . phone slider form factor moves smoothly , perhaps too much so . default , sliding phone completely open -- something that hard , but not impossible accidentally -- unlocks keypad . n-80 also bit awkward . it feels thick lack better word . its 5-way controller button also looks feels bit cheaper than you'd probably expect . drawback : no qwerty keyboard . you connect wireless one via bluetooth . but assumes you want carry keyboard . upshot predictive text feature solid sensible . when enabled , it works contextually : automatically sms email messages off when typing urls . overall , i give this phone high marks features , but few annoyances mean it far perfect phone	-1

battery life this unit great . i use it daily hour or so every day , single aaa least two weeks . ( it appears other reviews this vary lot . ) i use this headset both treo 650 phone , apple powerbook g4 . apple , i use it generic output device . ( i'm sure same goes other headsets . ) signal strong enough apple use it 30 feet away ; treo 650 , signal not nearly good . sound ok . it not best . if it noisy -- e.g. , like driving , or hotel room air conditioner fan blowing full-blast -- or if person other end not talking very loudly , then it sometimes hard hear . it'll drop audio -- i.e. , call goes back my cell phone -- when battery getting low . you milk it while longer , but that really your first clue battery . earpiece ok ; it not secure i'd hope . if you're outside gust , you may want hang it . also , people other end sometimes tell i'm headset this one -- they mention i sound little staticky . this my first bluetooth headset , so perhaps my rating higher just because it nifty gadget . but battery life this really winner -- my work-mates rechargeable headsets , it seems like they're always charge them . i use rechargeable nimh aaa , they just last really long time this unit	-1

personally , i think if you buying any sort razr its " functionality " you buying wrong phone . i personally owned numerous lg phones while they may not small , light , attractive motorola phones , lg phones built last . however , if you just looking cute phone easy carry your purse/pocket use just nice looking phone , this great one own . i previously lg vx9800 before i bought pink motorola razr v3c . i vx9800 because when i college i would text people constantly use aim feature during boring classes . phone incredible . however , now i am working world basically only use my phone call people , i wanted phone easier carry around " cute " . enter razr . i don't recommend this phone if your phone your life -- it doesn't much . however , if you just going using it make calls send occasional text , it wonderful . pink color verizon put out absolutely gorgeous--it almost purpley-pinkish lavendar color . my opinion , this pink prettier than t-mobile magenta much much much nicer than cingular pink ( i am not fan one all ) . essence , if you're looking high-tech phone , this not it . if you're looking lightweight , attractive phone just use calls some texting , this great buy	-1

i love my nextel i530 . purchased it almost year ago now . i am northern ohio travel many places around state . no matter where i gone , i take my phone everywhere me , i yet find place where my phone doesn't nextel service . also , very durable phone . i live farm here , we use two-way often communicate . my phone particular dropped several times , once off grain bin onto concrete 35 feet below , once also driven over four wheeler mud . still works like new . i am extremely happy nextel service phones . i know several other people different model nextel phones also can't complain . i would definitely recommend nextel over verizon , alltel , cingular , sprint . other companies such cheap phones it seems . it shame sprint nextel merged - my experience sprint , they terrible no service anywhere , their phones suck too	1
i this nextel it works verry good im verry happy it	1
great phone ... durable so far dependable . i buy larger battery . there one complaint , sometimes person you call sounds like they drunk . i don't know if it service or phone	-1
my previous phone motorola v60i monochrome screen cingular , so i am still getting used all differences phone capabilities barely scratched surface what i560 . here breakdown pros cons so far ( after week ) . pros ( order coolness , best first ): 1 . nextel direct connect amazingly fast their network very clear . 2 . any call , either directconnect or regular call made flip open or closed . you scroll through recent calls flip closed call any them . 3 . if you're concerned radio ( rf ) radiation - you should even though nobody talks it anymore , this phone extendable antenna get transmission point further away you ( improves transmission ) . 4 . speakerphone loud you need it , even dinning room table tv sound patched through stereo system ( very impressive ) . there virtually no lag switch listening speaking using speakerphone ( full duplex ) . you also turn its volume down whisper if you want . 5 . phone little wider than some phones ( like v60 ) , but very light . yet phone meets tough military specs . 6 . rubberized grips phone make it easy grip dial one hand phone comfortable feel my medium-sized hand . phone slight hourglass shape ( wider bottom ) fit nicely into hand . 7 . charger charges battery fast ... much faster than my v60 ever charged . 8 . phone all standard stuff i love couldn't live without : voice dialing , custom rings calls my contact list , handsfree , long recent calls list ( up 20 ) , ability store number contacts recent calls ( without key number , just enter name ) . cons ( order annoyance , worst first ): 1 . phone almost completely made plastic , i've never thought plastic durable metal . while motorola makes truly awesome phones , i worry there might over-reliance plastic protect insides phone . 2 . when phone holster , outside display not visible , forcing me remove phone holster see who calling ( those don't custom ring configured ) or check time . very annoying , i'm used using my phone watch . 3 . icons outside display small those who overdue new eye prescription might trouble seeing interpreting icons . only two parts clear : battery ( important ) date/time . 4 . flimsy port cover bottom phone ( where you connect charger , etc ) make me think someday i'm going look down there find it missing . it easy enough pop off , but sometimes takes " persuading " put back it cover slot completely ( because it needs snug fit meet military spec ) . overall , i really like phone highly recommend it all	1
i'm very happy this purchase overall . this battery huge improvement over ridiculous battery comes phone . talk time internet time increased greatly . i gave it 4 stars instead 5 because bluetooth eats this battery pretty fast . though still better than original battery . it may just phone . i no idea if it good one sprint sells 60 dollars . it definitely worth 20 bucks all day long	-1
only complaint i my a900 battery life . i am conference calls lot use my bluetooth headset which tends drain battery pretty quickly . this extended battery i am able use my headset without charge phone repeatedly . totally worth $15 , plus it arrived 4 business days standard shipping	1
i initially same lousy battery life lot people complained , until i applied fix : palm identified treo 680 device experience reduced battery life when camera used . camera may continue draw power battery when device standby mode . treo 680 users should install treo 680 camera update address this issue . [ ...	1
when i first got my phone , i quite excited . it more memory than my current treo 650 however only after one day i noticed battery life draining much faster than i anticipated . my research , i discovered few things needed before i extend my battery life more than 10 hours . 1)i apply camera patch since my phone manufactured prior jan 18th . this patch found palm support site . 2 ) i needed completely drain my battery until there nothing then charge it 24 hours . once i these two things , my phone lasted few days without charge , i've set my versamail retrieve messages when they arrive . this big plus me going getting emails every hour getting them when they arrive . i've no problems any my sd cards or mini-sd cards . increase internal memory also helps since i use my tomtom navigation my treo . i've heard various complaints , but you work through some them . it great phone	-1
i carrying pda razr cell phone . when i got this phone i gave my pda my brother my razr my daughter . i love full contact list addresses , all phone numbers notes my outlook it syncs outlook . calendar really nice too syncs outlook . i don't try use it browsing internet , but i use t-mobiles t-zones collect all my email all my various email address types . it took some learning find easiest way get everything , but it there you look , called received numbers one key press , extremely easy contact look up my favorite applications stay screen so they only push or two away . it everything any cell phone works well or better easier . speaker phone great one touch ( or speed ) dialing great . i store hundreds phone numbers numbers i choose , then use spot number make call instead looking up numbers ( ie : lee cell spot 5 , home spot 15 , office spot 25 ) i found message board especially dash helped me learn lot phone . coverage t-mobile good any . some areas i service where friends other providers don't some areas they service i don't . all all , i find i service across country without much trouble i drive . if you t-mobile cell service , their t-zones email many other internet based services only $5 wifi service only $20 ( monthly ) , can't beat . full keyboard makes text messaging keeping notes much easier more fun . it not full pda , but it everything i my pda . it way more than phone , really small thin , easy carry , easy lock unlock keyboard . it takes nice pictures emergencies if i don't my camera it uses mini sd card , which i installed use store pictures videos . personally , i can't think negative thing it . it not laptop computer , but i think it best cell phone market . my cousin blackberry he jealous me my dash	1
i tried many many cell phones but this phone unbelievable . i put 1 gig memory card it . right now , i 140,000 word dictionary it , niv bible , star wars , many videos my son , 100 wma songs , ton pictures . it syncs up ms outlook like charm so all my contacts , appts , tasks , emails always up date . it comes bluetooth works great my logitech headset . it also wifi which flawless my wireless network very speedy . screen absolutely gorgeous . camera takes decent pictures video . one best features battery life . all it it lasts incredibly long time . i not found smartphone even comes close these features especially price . i like it waaaay better than treo , blackberries , , or any other qwerty device . it glued my hip i use it all time . i love it !!	1
after trying this phone out few days here my personal resultspros1 . what attracted me this phone fitness features , flip phone design rugged design . so far i like pedometer/running tools . you calibrate it manually if you want best results , but right out box it okay so far . 2 . i've other mp3 cell phones ( lg vx8500 chocolate , samsung sch-a930 , motorola slvr l7 ) this one blows all others out this category . granted this not going contend ipod but cell phone walkman abilities impressive . 3 . user interface . far cleanest most intuitive i've used . but then i guess almost anything upgrade over verizon os . cons1 . i can't stand armband came this . length headphones cord way too long running , least me personally . it taken me few times figure out something comfortable terms cord management . 2 . button layout . my hands aren't big any means but i still trouble some dedicated buttons ( walkman , internet , shortcuts , power on/off ) . 3 . 2 megapixel camera . i said i don't use camera feature often i'm glad i don't this camera . this most stripped down , barebones 2 megapixel camera i used . overall i must say i am satisfied my purchase ; i'm still tyring figure out some features this phone . i choice this w810i same price sony store i opted this one because flip phone style fitness features i must say these two features haven't let me down yet , otherwise i would've gone w810	-1
mp3 player simple use , accessible while phone closed , sounds great . you use any headsets or earbuds you prefer , radio makes it device choice gym-rats or runners alike . sturdy , fairly easy figure out , fine reception . great phone if you don't need " smartphone " features	1
i only this phone few days now but i used every feature it offer . i must say this best phone i ever owned . only real problem i my fat fingers sometimes hit buttons i didn't intend but it really not big deal ; i just need re-train my hands . i am happy picture quality well video quality . audio options great me all i really wanted able load my own songs use ringtones motorola made this pretty simple task	1
great new phone here . advanced video captures , decent zoom playback ability . great travel , excellent sounding mp3 player integrated , bluetooth ready , big hard drive tunes . real good looking design well . so far so good	-1
i just got cable software my motorall v600 it very easy use . i just backup all my contacts , pics music ;	1
i really like fit function this cingular 8125 case . all holes correct location belt clip comfortable ( no sharp edges irritate ) . i ordered 2 other cases elsewhere not fit properly i sent them back . this one keeper	1

product what offered came quickly . no hassle , great seller amazing price	1
i ordered this case just my wife it fit like glove . we both sprints katana you cannot find better case its price . definate buy	1

silicone protective covering treo exactly what i wanted just what i expected it . it fits my treo 650 perfectly i couldn't happier . i am going buy different color	1
i use this all time . it gives good protection , ease use , good handling . only disadvantage you not keep it when putting unit vetical dock . however , this true any protective skin . outstanding product .	1
hey this great phone . i it week now it works flawlessly . i never owned sony ericsson phone before but i am really happy . camera awesome call quality clear it gets great reception . definetly phone pick up if you looking new one	1
ordered 2 cables dln . they shipped quickly , keep me updated cables arrived well packaged . they good quality work well . i like it charges phone you sync up . highly recommended - such good price	1
i like this more than one reason ... so read , reason #1 - it keeps charging your cell phone when you transferring data , trust me this helps , when you transferring 1 gb data you loose reasonable amount battery charge your cell phone . reason #2 - only data played your cell phone gets transferred , so this way you know before hand all data you transferred actually play when you back seat your car . you use windows media player sync this phone ( samsung sync sgh-a707 ) order transfer files . mp3 wmv/wma formats work this phone , i not know whether other formats work or not . let me explain brief how sync this phone windows media player . connect one end cable your phone first usb end your computer usb port ( preferably usb 2.0 ) . if you already inserted media card into phone you see two drives named samsung phone samsung media card when you open my computer your computer . now open windows media player , you able see following tabs just below main menu . left right you able see this order - now playing , library , rip , burn , sync , guide . click sync . make sure your cell phone connected , now you see two halves same window , left half you drag drop your file needs transferred right half where it goes ( your cell phone name apears top ) , usually windows media player prepares transfer file , this takes while . also just above right window drop down box make sure you select samsung media card , samsung phone option very limited memory . once you well versed what your phone play , i would recommed copying files your microsd using usb reader/writer windows media player takes time preparing windows environment sucessful transfer , this saves you chunk time battery power .	1
silicone protective covering treo exactly what i wanted just what i expected it . it fits my treo 650 perfectly i couldn't happier . i am going buy different color	1
i use this all time . it gives good protection , ease use , good handling . only disadvantage you not keep it when putting unit vetical dock . however , this true any protective skin . outstanding product .	1
this kind thing you don't care unless it malfunctions . i've no problems all it . it seems sturdily built , unlikely break easily . right-angle bend plug means it less likely snap off device ( problem straight plugs ) . it doesn't seem made cheaply possible , but instead made well	1
holds phone attractive , snug , leather case ! clips belt holds tight . since phone horizontal not vertical , i don't trouble catching it things . i've broken clip several cases getting out car . phone would catch something plastic clip would snap . this case works great eliminates problem ! perfect solution	1
after year , ear support this bluetooth headset broke . bad news . good news : it 2 year warranty logitech replacing it mobile traveller model since mobile freedom no longer made . contact logitech tech support / audio phone ( can't over web ) . it nice see company stand behind their products . way go , logitech	-1
i've several gens candybar blackberries , 7100 nice but reception/mike horrendous , 7130 much better , finally nailed it . dubious when i take pearl when my 7130 went funky .... but i'll give it full thumbs up now . slightly smaller than 7130 , which oddly make difference , like size decreases give exponential feasibility increases or something . makes my partner treo look like firstgen cell comparison . unobtrustive yr pocket . " pearl " trackball just fine , like it better than roller actually . reception , mike quality also good , despite concerns they reviewed worse than 7130 . writing good too , suretype continuing so durn accurate i sometimes forget check . hey , i like camera . so , i thought 7130 my perfect smartphone , one i just stopped thinking cause it it all just great .... but actually ... i like pearl better . if you need bulletproof email , pda , phone , this yr baby . slightly shorter battery life , but hasn't stranded me yet .	1
this my first blackberry device . fact , this first cell phone i've where i data plan setup . i gotta say i'm luving it ! my email gets me sometimes even before it shows up my desktop . browser very robust seems work great . i've installed few extra applications ( google maps , bbweather , yahoo go name few ) i haven't any problems . applications cover broad spectrum interests really useful . i still yet try opera browser bb . camera so clear without flash it scary . it beats my old cameraphone hands down!i've discovered moniker " crackberry " so true . i'm just hooked getting emails , surfing web listening some tunes , all same device same time . i've discovered whole community simmilar bb addicts they really helpful discovering ins this device . pearl suretype keyboard learns i go words it didn't get right first it now picks up selects i type . i don't even need censor typing too often anymore . i stuck suretype mode caught it right quick . this may because i've never used any other type mobile device keyboard prior pearl . learning curve but shallow hill . my only complaints mp3 player not play through wireless headset . you trick it into doing so , but normal play only through speaker device or through wired headset . also speakerphone bit muffled battery cover actually covers up speaker ! now there after mod kits oem battery cover hole speakerphone , but come . finally vibration phone kind weak . not big complaint but it bears mentioning . overall this device great beginners like myself . i cannot recommend it enough	-1
this my first blackberry phone i must say it awesome device ! my husband blackberry through his work so i got one too . how we pin each other , keep touch via email , etc . while he away . pearl wonderful reception , great style , great features , etc . i highly recommend it	1

this phone great ! i got it christmas it works like charm ! loud speaker excellent ringtones cool . some wallpapers bit weird but they nice ones too . ringtones loud you easily hear it ringing . lcd screen big menus easy navigate . buttons comfortable size i love this phone . so far i haven't found any flaws all phone great battery life . i keep it few hours bars stayed same ! i highly reccomend this phone any who like it . phone light weight small it doesn't get way ! i love this phone encouraged someone get one already . even though it doesn't camera , i'd say it still great ! cons .... i cannot think any anyone who says you cannot hear it ring or virgin mobile no good wrong company . virgin mobile great but not designed those people who their phones all day . it not phone fault .	-1
i admit , if you want more prepaid , virgin mobile rip off . but if you're only going use your phone once while , then it alright . i bought my audiovox year or two ago it good investment . sleek phone , outer dsiplay , calls good quality i never would get dropped calls . furthermore , color display great battery life amazing . phone all basic features , looks great , practical anyone who not looking anything outrageous like cameras or mp3 . i also say despite service vmobile good phones . but now i'm needing my phone more more i'm ready dump virgin mobile because whole 25 cents minute 10 cents after too expensive . i agree other reviews . their new " promotions " those hardly last only new customers .. so much customer service . ringtones little pricey , but still reasonable ; test messaging available 10 cents , good price . if you want get more features , minutes , whatever , i say look into other prepaid offers like net10 , tracphone or t-mobile . you get more prepaid t-mobile but phones good stuff cost you bit more	-1
ok . i say i realtor , nurse , hr person , mom . means heavy phone user- since 1990 . my first phone old motorola brick analog . one greatest biggest phones ever . i remember my first digital phone , first pnone games . i total 5 phones , motorola , nokia , ericson , panasonic . this kyocera best . i don't want treo palm because i already travel lap top . what i want text phone small easy use . this querty key board rocks . menu just like computer easy make selections . more features you need phone , more you want qwerty key board . get this phone happy . also saleslady threw it ground when back came off she snapped it back used it . very sturdy little phone , antena loop so it won't poke you . comes very easy read guide book so start up easy . i paid $199 this phone my region it worth every penny	1
i've using my blackjack 3 months now i love it . sure there things i would change , but blackjack come very close fulfilling all my wishes . cons : * keyboard buttons really small , but then i'm not sure how you could fit all them phone if they bigger . i wouldn't want phone get any bigger . * if you ever see ad number like this - " 1-800-big-deal " good luck figuring out alpha-to-numeric translation . haha . i issue not long ago . however , i think all smartphones issue . * lacks voice dialing via bluetooth headset . this one big me . i upgraded bj razr really miss this feature . pros : list would too long if i mentioned all great features this phone . so here few : * browser support awesome ! i view everything , even flash apps ! * vpn support . if you corporate , ' nuff said . this rocks . * easy bluetooth setup management . * perfect size smartphone . not too wide very thin . * glass screen ( doesn't scratch ) screen resolution unbelievable . * quick toggle scroll button side life saver . * extended life battery comes phone . * easy side access sd card . no slide battery off remove or replace . there ton great things this phone . i hear iphone supposed real deal , but until i see myself , i'm sticking this beauty . buy one . you won't sorry . i got mine $75 $75 rebate . free ? can't go wrong which ever way you look it . :)	1

sansa e200 good all things it considering it only flash memory based player similar ipod nano . unlike , nano it play video comes its own video conversion software . further , unlike nano , sansa built fm tuner fm recorder which nice . finally , sansa voice recorder which i not personal use but just goes show how feature rich this mp3 player . negative side : sansa , which accept upto 2gig microsd memory card , but turns slowly when memory card placed expansion slot . i like listen audio books sansa not ability bookmark . this makes listening audio books very difficult . overall , sansa very feature rich player great battery life only few shortcomings	-1
great choice casual heavy duty sansa user . strong looks good . it even comes clear plastic screen saver . i am very happy this product	1
i'm previous owner body glove cel phone cases ( moto v810 ) . i purchased this item amazon few days ago my 6255 . my cel fits perfectly . case protects every part my cel ( buttons , screens , jacks ) use every option cel so comfortable it would without case , looks nice . my next phone its body glove case too	1
this great case ! i motorola v180 purchased returned 2 phone cases prior this purchase only phone month because they such poor quality or holes didn't line up . because this flip phone , most cases move when you open shut phone , covering speakers , etc . this case 2 pieces connect together so movement , when you open close phone , doesn't affect placement holes , etc . case . also , quality materials fit this case excellent .	1
this device works great . i use it usb laptop charge treo 650 . i also use it wall outlet car . no problems . cords retract when you want fold it up so very convenient . it not come case , so you'll use your own bag or whatever . part fits into treo very secure . it not pop off like other chargers . only thing i see could problem if you rough pieces or they just loose bag they get lost or possibloy damaged	1
functions same more expensive chargers sold cellphone stores . excellent product price . i bought two ... one home one work	1

i bought this even though i saw lot negative reviews , some battery life , some dropped signals . so far i neither . i owned many palm devices over years i first one say palm make lemons , when happens they usually deny it until they come up patch much later , if they ever . not most customer-oriented , quality-oriented company out there . but their os still easiest use my mind , myriad apps out there you make it whatever you want , pretty much . screen smallish side compared tx , but it not bad , especially phone . it pretty reliable , i put lot my old software it . battery what surprised me most ; i expecting something really bad , but so far i never under 50% , i am heavy palm user . i don't use phone part it much , just call here there , i turn phone function off night . i also bought kblightsoff , which turns off keyboard lights unless you using it , which probably helps lot . so these two settings , battery life close tx my opinion . i one dead pixel , but happen any electronics manufacturer . i don't like 2.5 mm jack bottom device , that terrible place put it . but adapter i use my good headphones sound good . get ptunes deluxe so you use subsription music like napster or yahoo music . i should receive my 8gb sdhc card tomorrow , which turn my treo into iphone killer , imho . way less than $599 ... sound level ok , you get software boosts it up if you're deaf . speaker level loud ! sms program great , phone app great fast . so , overall , it great device . i wish palm wouldn't charge arm leg accessories , but you don't buy them ..	1
my chocolate phone obviously valuable me , so i want keep it tip top condition , this skin incredibely sexy allows me use my phone ease .	1
whole process took only 5 minites phone cingular wireless customer service port over my number verizon . treo 750 snap figure out , setting up my email took only few minutes . i've owned it three weeks now i am still discovering great phone/pda features . i bought 4gb mini sd card ( samsung memory ) ebay $39.99 . combined it hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 300 songs . i also bought shure tec3 earbuds $110 . they're best sounding earbuds you get 2.5 mm jack .	1
i bought my treo 750v couple days ago . i got really impressed its features none problems already reported , like short time lived batery . only problem i am facing setting my voice mail . icon shown today page not accept any number i attach it . result , i forced create new speed dial icon my voice mail number . i really hope this problem fixed soon palm downloadable file because , except this problem , treo 750 really great	-1
my husband uses this phone work it one funniest ringtones i've ever heard . i don't know what it called but it upbeat techno rhythm it . walkie talkie feature very useful everyone his business network uses it all time , including him . it great business many locations . i only give this product four stars because i haven't tried it myself so i don't know all features . but i hope review i've provided helps	-1
i problems my second i730 transmitting receiving , so i decided upgrade my phones . ( first 730 speaker grill came off , i tried glue it back myself . word wise , don't use too much glue . ) so , i went nextel get my new i760 after researching it internet . i didn't need camera phone , since i digital camera takes awesome pictures . one bad thing since i changed my phone back april , i couldn't sign back up two years get $150 . i could only sign up year , i pay $275 . i don't understand . but this review phone : cons : super short battery life , especially if you web . instead separate button each number key , it three big keys , little squares make it look like there separate keys . unfortunately , you careful hit button fairly close center , otherwise you'll dial number above or beneath it . jury still out this one , but i'll list it under cons . casing looks like it might break easy since it mainly plastic , whereas 730 least looked like some sort metal . pros : huge displaya whole lot lighter than 730i enjoy photo caller id . it also shows photo when you call personthe sleep mode good addition . if you don't use phone couple minutes , phone power down little like your screen saver so all you push button wake it up . only thing i really miss 730 multitude lights around motorola emblem front , especially since there several colors . this phone just blinks lot your ring tone light blue . oh well . i'll write more more i explore phone .	-1

i got this phone basically free , but even taking into account , i'm pretty disappointed phone . this my first samsung , i'm pretty sure , my last one ! i owned nokia before i regret i " betrayed " it . now i wouldn't get anything besides nokia worst case maybe sony-ericsson . so here short list those " little things " make your life , this phone ( it combination t-mobile ) , annoying : - keys not comfortable use . - it not really comfortable open/close slider make it easier you put your thumb screen which leaves greasy all time . - putting comma , while writing text message , capitalizes next word - what logic ?! ( it annoys me because i use text messages lot)- you can't set camera shutter silent ... - you only save 1 phone type each category - what if person 2 business phones ... - you cannot choose e-mail address person contact list when you want send picture message e-mail address . there lot more those little illogical things just not thought through , like it would've nokia ( even model 5 years old ! )oh yeah , t-mobile really " contributed " " greatness " this phone , removing some features limiting others , like setting your mp3 ringtone ( although , there easy hack around it : just change extension . mp3 . 3gp	1

originally , i purchased this heavy-duty case protect my new expensive 8525 . however , wearing case my belt belt clip , my phone fell out case several times when case cover accidentally opened up . luckily phone not functionally damaged , but i several big dents scratches case . i'm going stop using case now , since phone now already beat-up . latch mechanism cover loosen up use , especially since you'll open close it repeatedly access touch screen . also , it took bit getting used , open case make phone call . overall quality this case very good tho , because it fits phone very snuggly holes line up all buttons . i guess its great case if you don't wear it your belt . but i can't justify such huge case if i carry it my pocket .	1

after my nextel phone started acting up , i decided switch services because i liked razr style lot people i calling already verizon so " " calling bonus . i this phone all 3 days already miss my motorola i860 . you import only couple mp3s before phones memory full , unless you buy their $50 transflash card ( 1 gig largest ) . then , you cannot assign mp3s you import ringtones either , major disappointment me - again missing my i860 its 400+ ringtones i imported random wav , midi mp3 files . you cannot change softkeys main menu either calendar hard input events ( you set reminder all , there no option no reminder ) . all all , not what i grew accustomed my i860 . i'm already thinking $175 early term charge bargain compared what i spend over life my 2-year contract . leads me rip-off verizon , they charge you extra $35 sign only one-year term ! next time i'll read fine print , just upgrade my nextel	-1

there nothing quot ; universalquot ; this product . it'll split lightweight stuff like cell phones , but don't trust anything more demanding than this splitter . i hooked my laptop up through it fuse blew within one second . sadly , i'd bought four these since shipping cost much item itself , all four died when i tried them my laptop . back package says not use items use over total 10amps , which seemed reasonable , so i got out my ammeter figured out my laptop used 6amps most , so not only this busted , but they lie package . i managed open up splitter put some more heavy duty wiring stronger fuse , then it worked short time until i started smelling plastic melting -- it turns out even one springs inside couldn't handle 6amps heated up enough disfigure melt plastic around it . i give this item two stars only because you might want plug two cell phones simultaneously . anything else , beware	1
my problems nextel not stop when i canceled my service . i get problems service . when i went get new phone day before my contract expired , i course wanted keep my number . so i went get my cingular phone ( highly recommended ) , i old number switched my new number . today , i get mail my nextel statement month $200 early termination even though i not canceled my service , but simply got new phone switched my number over . this icing cake after 2 years absolutely amazingy bad service nextel . my town , not small town any means , there very few places any service . largest subdivision , you cannot get service anywhere . i constantly get comments people trying reach me get classic nextel line ... please hold while nextel subscriber you trying reach located . most time i would not even recieve incoming calls , calls would go straight my voice mail . not only would i not get calls , but often i would not even get voice mails until days or even weeks later . when i actually take calls ( call out ) , i cannot count number times i've my call dropped . i recieved so many different error messages sometimes i wonder if they just spend all their time nextel thinking different error messages program into their phones . brings me selling point nextel , famed well-loved direct connect feature . this absolute joke . direct connect only works maybe half time i tried use it . even then , middle conversation i would greeted loud beep my phone telling me i wont talking person anymore . course , i would expect nothing less nextel network . text messaging nextel next impossible . if it not take hours send or recieve message , it took days , or maybe didn't even come all . internet access fine , it rare instance it worked . course , when you don't service , you don't get internet access either . i constantly getting message " network not available " . calling trying complain nextel futile . trying get through customer service takes forever once you get through they nothing . my experience nextel nothing short disaster i write this trying warn anyone considering nextel . stick verizon or cingular you much happier end . don't make same mistake i .	-1
purchased this phone upgrade i530 , which i loved . i end 2 year contract , felt i would get something few more bells whistles - excited color screen icons . two my family members higher end nextels all work well . i would purchased one those , except i didn't really care camera my phone , this one reasonably priced ... i found out you get what you pay ! i560 felt almost cheap construction compared i750 , i870 even my old i530 . i it couple weeks when i started trouble clarity my calls - i could hear them , but they couldn't hear me . couple times , i screen go airplane mode , even when i hadn't touched it . fact you take whole phone out see who calling downside , too . my previous phone flipped open see who calling , but i holster could hold phone without disengaging it . not great design this holster . problem power supply . when charging phone , it especially important make sure plug seated tight - check says device attached - it comes out easy stops charging even when it appears plugged into phone correctly . then i am phone call speakerphone whole speaker just stops working . living california apparently gives us advantage - 30 day risk free guarantee . fortunately , we day 12 , after 54 minutes , one accidental disconnection nextel 6 customer service agents , i finally received return authorization placed new order . terrible , terrible phone . stay away it . hoping new one it way works much better ! michell	-1

although this product very nice , i feel though wording they use describe it incorrect . me words " charge all once " means i charge all devices only one cord plugs into wall . however , this not case . this item simply method organizing you devices . although it nice idea , it certainly not worth $34.99 i paid , if it wasn't gift , christmas wasn't 3.5 days away , i would return it . i feel using words , " charge all once " they purposely misleading customer .	1
i ' upgraded ' this phone recently treo 650 speaker audio problems ( don't all treo 650 suffer within year usage ? ) already replaced once refurbished one developed same problems . i loved my treo 650 anyway so i expected something equivalent 650 but what i got ' smartphone ' quite stupid battery life . i decided there definitely some glitch design ( some online geeks suggest it might actually sim card ) causing power run right out phone , sharp decline , even when its not use all possible extraneous functions disabled . add this fact palm website online user group not active right now ( so no users visibly discuss this among themselves ) , you don't think too long conclude palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward , when they recently dumped this cheaper " smartphone " market recently . palm , all i say pretty " stupid " wonder if this your last hurrah before exiting " smartphone " market ?	1
summary , microsoft software t-mobile service ruined brilliant design ( although couple flaws ) htc . there many pros cons this device service it shackled . i break it down hardware , software cell phone service provider . hardware pro's:a lot written this aspect device , so i'll keep this minimum - best form factor i've ever seen . this device provides you power blackberry without bulky hardware so i put it my pocket comfortably not look like geek belt holster . - key selling point me combined bluetooth , wi-fi quad-band connectivity enabled me connect wireless headset , cruise web pages access email when us or europe . - phone quality excellent . - keyboard layout excellent easy use medium sized emails . - battery life great when wi-fi not enabled adequate when it . ( i've rarely struggled dying battery . ) stand-by power management appears excellent . - charging device very quick . - display , while little small , crystal clear surprisingly easy use given its size . - camera pretty good it really great emailing photo people i'm traveling around . [ after all cons you'll read below you'll wonder why i ever bought device why i still use it . well here it : 1 . t-mobile locked me into 2 year contract very expensive device . 2 . it great hardware i use us europe , i'm just hoping microsoft finally get it right . ] hardware con's- touch sensitive volume button most ill-conceived feature i've ever seen . even after playing around various settings it still hard quickly set volume desired level . even worse , when using phone your ear or finger inadvertently hit control randomly change volume . - ti omap 850 201mhz not beefy enough software loaded onto device . however , blame could well laid microsoft door writing inefficient code poor scheduling software tasks applications . either way , performance very slow some basic functions ( see below ) i'm afraid some blame needs laid choice processor . software pro's- not many really come mind . software con ( i hope you're sitting comfortably)- when call call waiting phone fails give option user select which call take which call put hold or drop/ignore . occasions this problem occurred me call dropped/kept appears random preference switch incoming call no matter what depressed . other call dropped not put hold . - when call incoming keyboard locked , if user depresses green phone key call dropped . this extremely counter intuitive . if user presses anything other than " answer " key call dropped sometimes call dropped even when i depressed " answer " key . - contacts database extremely rudimentary very limited number views filters used . even worse , upon selection , contacts database takes 5 8 seconds open . now , i what some would call large database contacts , but considering palm os version responded immediately far more sophisticated use model this excuse not wash . it simply poorly architected database . - user interface entering new contact rudimentary ( all dialog windows this device . )- one most annoying aspects this device alarm clock . user interface looks like it written 10 minutes clearly not verified correctness . digital watch i 1982 same degree sophistication but more intuitive use model more thoroughly debugged . first all , user only gets select time if alarm or off . interface you would assume you could only set single alarm .... if only it obvious . best way explain this buggy piece software example : i set alarm 6am ; next day alarm goes off 6am . day i set alarm 7am - following day alarm goes off 6am 7am . next day i set alarm 7:30 am you guessed it , alarm now goes off three times . best i've able deduce ( course , this type behavior not documented user manual comes device ) user actively select " off " current setting before setting " " new time . but there no indication what alarms set , so after while or particularly busy week you loose track what set what isn't .... only way clear all alarms set hard re-boot . - calculator joke . if this took engineer 10 minutes write they should fired . calculator watch ' 80 more sophisticated features . user interface so bad it hard describe it words . - microsoft truly not understand how user would like use device instead insists using same usage model they've inflicted upon us since windows 95 . most features or function navigated through start menu button . applications nested features hidden behind several annoying menu selections . some features simply hard find , but should it really take so many menu selections find common tools or applications ? - use alarms or reminders ambiguous - put device " silent " mode , but leave alarms because you want sleep only want your alarm wake you up , example , not work . calendar reminders active they assigned alarm property instead their own or notification property . only way around this cancel reminders all day events .... otherwise you get alarm midnight . - so , my nokia phone thousand years ago , when i went europe my phone would simple selection new frequency i needed once landed . phone would then automatically connect provider available . it wasn't completely automatic , but user interaction simple intuitive . not dash . first all t-mobile doesn't help keeping radio button your online account you select enable international roaming . feature free so why not add selection anyway ? all you know when you get your destination your phone won't connect local network no matter what you . now , assuming you worked this out , you now faced challenge actually connecting local provider network . my blackberry this automatic , but course microsoft there selections make , searches activate various other contortions need gone through before you connect provider choice . assuming you get connected all . - activesync : this most annoying piece software it just not work . worse still , when it not work it gives cryptic error message stating error occurred some data lost next time you perform synchronization . it not provide you fix , hint or path so you don't lose data . it not even tell you data lost . so , i'm using microsoft mobile os microsoft xp microsoft outlook they can't get right ? ( ok , it maybe serves me right signing up so much microsoft , but come . ) this primary purchasing driver me . i am very busy want my schedule up date my pc pda - all time . it only way keep organized . i thought same provider all software i'd ok . also , this feature around over decade palm perfected blackberry .... how hard it ? there probably annoying nits i software , but those major ones . they major . considering this windows mobile 5.0 what earth they doing 1.0 , 2.0 , etc .? service provider pro- t-mobile useful me traveling europe . they much better coverage over there than us ( where i'm actually paying ) . - their package competitive . service provider con : - coverage not good enough . i'm san francisco i dead spots my house . - their back-end connectivity your email providers terribly buggy . random times you get cryptic messages saying you must something wrong your connection emails can't accessed . but you know there nothing wrong your connection because you've browser . also , there whole day emails not accessible . because many issues i'd email set up maintaining connection i went through various debug routines wondering what failed . when i finally called technical support they told me their service down - no apology , no notification , no nothing . certainly no minutes make up inconvenience . ( so , why didn't i call technical support earlier ? read below ... )- their technical support structure terrible . i collectively wasted over 12 hours my life their " help " line . i'm not going go into details it would just take too long . bottom line , if you problem your phone say " dash " prompt then ask tier three data support . everything you get before waste your time technicians you'll encounter inadequate training . if you then put hold given number dial - not it - this cycles you back around tier two data support you go back back line someone understands device . so , should you buy it ? wait until windows mobile 6.0 comes out least . maybe provider pick up device time . then see what else available	1

after reading numerous positive reviews this phone , i purchased . here main issues i found this phone : 1 ) buttons too small , particularly main control button . you used side your fingers ensure you not hit too buttons same time . , believe me , i not very large hands . 2 ) if you quite few contacts your phone , you irritated delay when you scroll down quickly select contact . you notice if you not careful , you dial wrong contact due delay when scrolling selecting quickly , so if this you , aware . 3 ) you must open cover look inside see if you missed call or message . very inconvenient !! there no indication show this top screen , only inside screen . 4 ) occasion , display outside phone stops working entirely . what you just need power phone down they back up again . not optimal , i probably just got bad phone , but i am just waiting situation get more frequent , so i then deal likely nightmare get replacement phone motorola . note : i no personal vendetta against motorola , but wanted provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff i bought into before purchasing	-1

phone may fine but i never know because my virgin mobile service never really worked . perhaps it phones fault i never received text messages even though they deducted my account . overall their customer service awful . days waiting receiving no information . i file 4 investigations because they would close them without resolving issue or they not filled out right . i spent hours phone them never problem fixed . now i thrown away bunch money crappy service . i plan just run out minutes then disconnect phone . its garbage . i went t-mobile sidekick already am way happier	-1
i've this thing two weeks . coming blackberry 8700c , this phone big disappointment . work issued this took away blackberry i'm stuck it . all i whine internet , so here it goes . more i use thing less i like it . here my list , good bad . * battery life - attrocious . use extended battery , throw away standard one . trust me . grade : . * navigation - cumbersome . keys too small , 5-way nav buttons get pressed accidentally . workable if you don't huge hands . grade : * windows mobile - i hate it . why applications not quit when you end them ? instead they stay memory resident you manually cancel them using task manager . menu pre-loaded goodies buy cingular , how convenient . grade : c+ if you bother learn shortcut keys . * java broken , google email doesn't work . maps work new version , thankfully . grade : . * no standard headphone jack . hello ?? this suppose mp3 player , right ? somebody explain me why this ok . grade : . * phone quality - grade . yes , they something right . phone works great , reception great , speakerphone great . bluetooth great . * outlook email - this workable , but difficult . you write email , you edit your schedule tasks , but it not easy . if blackberry gets " " ( it ) , blackjack gets . it doesn't synch notes , so if you're outlook notes person you're just left out , sorry . why ?? * hardware quality - very good , b+ . thing really feels solidly built . screen vibrant attractive . camera seems work fine , although i may use it twice per year . short , if you really want get work your phone get blackberry . if you want phone lot things poorly but looks nice , this could one you .	1

i ordered before brent birckhead review came up i got taken . this not leather case lg env vx-9900 . correct internal dimension : 4 " 1 3/4 " 0.5 " , clearly not size vx9900 fit into . considering seller enters " product dimensions " 4 ounces instead measurments , one might suspect this may not honest mistake . i think amazon needs take better responsibility ensuring sellers fill out description properly	-1

i've using my t809 since january mostly love it . three main problems : 1 ) there some sort pinhole leak upper right corner screen where dust gets behind screen lens . looks like crap when display inactive . i've read other people this problem too . 2 ) i hardly ever use this mp3 player because you use their poorly designed headset ( they won't stay my ears ! ) because you can't hear phone ring over headset while listening music . 3 ) ring starts off softly builds louder volume . if i phone my pocket i miss first couple rings ( too quiet ) time i realize i'm getting call fumble get it out my pocket , i've usually missed call . this sucks i don't think there setting disable this " feature " . it close ideal , but no cigar . camera great , reception great , easy use . but i'll probably look something similar but better after my contract expires . btw , if you get insurance thru tmobile any phone , make sure you see it bill . i problem water damage three weeks after buying . tmobile claimed i never asked insurance , but fortunately amazon exchanged it .	1
i just picked up one these my motorola cell phone . it more than enough volume . it comes both right left ear adapter . fits pretty good i medium sized ears . its really light but because it clips your ear earpiece fits slighly your ear you feel you wearing it . it very comfortable though . if you make lot cell phone calls this very good ear headset .	1
these work great keeping earbuds comfortably place while allowing one hear others speaking , say grocery store . course they not provide audiophile quality sound , but they're great listening podcasts while doing shopping . only downside they bulky so not fit any earbud holder while not use . taking eargels off store earbuds off possible but difficult enough annoying	1
i recently got this phone love it . t-mobile service may not best , but i no problems phone itself . all people saying it isn't really magenta-it . pink razr offered cingular pale pink , t-mobile phone hot pink magenta shown . i looked them bestbuy before buying saw different carriers different shades	1
i purchased pink razr cingular service couldn't happier . i it month no problems all . i am very happy it . t-mobile not very good service my opinion why i chose cingular	1

love it . sort metallic red soft touch rubber feel . some soft touch coming off corners wear but it still red which nice . i probably get color it spring . fit so snug phone ppl actually ask me where i got my razr since sprint red little different . also maintains all openings data cables etc	1
this protects my ppc 6700 wonderfully ... i've dropped it many times this case protected it like i wanted ... no scratches , nothing ... room extended battery great too , because extended battery adds hours hours too life my phone	1
fast service , good price . look forward future business dealings .	1
i keep this short point this best phone i ever owned . its great taking pictures pictures come out so clear	1
these javoscreen treo 650 protectors really very different anything you've normally seen . typically , 95% screen protectors very thin material you stick screen , hope against hope you don't bubbles , but you almost always . when screen off , you see bubbles , thankfully when screen , bubbles pretty invisible ..... but these javoscreen protectors completely different animal . they thick , tough , relatively firm . because those properties , they go no bubbles , they easily moveable ( adjustable ) should you not get it perfectly first time . further , they come little squeegee thingy make sure its there good . this state art screen protectors . this all becomes even bigger issue men , because whiskers , over time screen get dulled scratched . because thickness quality these , scratches screen no longer issue .	1
i not any problems this phone . i dont use it long periods time ... only car text . adding minutes easy i really get my moneys worth rollover . i averaged it less than 10 bucks month 600 minutes spare ... so its great me . i got better ringtones online still waiting see wallpaper . overall , i would recommend this phone if you dont need more than 100 minutes per week	1
overall i'm happy skin . it fits treo 700 very closely . this custom formed every curve , bump , button treo . my one complaint they advertise it compatible 700w 700p . i should paid more attention pictures thought it . 700w , if you don't know , almost identical except buttons just below screen . button layout same , but they different icons purposes . well , skin images button covers 700w , not 700p . not huge deal , just slight annoyance . i'm going see if there way remove these somehow	1
this best bluetooth i used . wind noice no problem , user friendly coustomer support cardo great . i 5 co worker who order headset . just great product . great pric	1
overall , i like it . best part flip up screen protector . i 2 zire models managed break both screens . my dislike i it 4 months it no longer form fitting . i tried get info how shrink it tight again , no avail . sd card issue , i remedied carfully opening up slot xacto blade allow room card clearly eject . keep take skin off reset my treo , i drilled hole back , right through battery cover allow easy resetting when my treo crashes	1

this good holster my v220 . it doesnt hang up me much erson who last reviewed it . holster i give it 4 stars because its function hold cell phone place your belt . one problem i it it holds phone down where strap should , so strap it wouldnt work too well . also because it holds it where strap , it adds little wear area . other than its good holster price . thats one my problems . i paid 14 dollars this my local mall , which highly over priced my standards . amazon seems like great place buy it , but if you search motorola v220 phone accessories , then you find site free shipping it , its 7 bucks . theres also site it 3 bucks , but shipping . i trust amazons shipping though . so if you want functional holster , get this one	1
i've virgin mobile customer few years now agree earlier reviewer -- if you want phone-phone ( without all extra hoopla ) this isn't bad deal . i " * bought " red slice couple weeks ago ( take note i'm not one those people cell phone perpetually growing out one ear ) my needs ( emergencies , quick calls family grocery store ) it just right . good points : i got mine " * free " reward zone points best buy . fits into small purse or pocket easily . nice looking ( someone mistook it " chocolate " other day ) . clear reception ( long distance calls just crystal local ; not sure if this " area " thing , but apparently service around chicago solid ) . pay-as-you-go option works well someone who doesn't spend lot time phone . my slice holds charge just fine ( i've noticed other reviewers said this problem , but so far , so good ) doesn't heat up , someone else mentioned ( maybe reviewer got defective phone or battery ? ) . not so good points:it so slim my husband bet me i'll lose phone within couple months ( could easy misplace if you keep stacks papers books your desk ) . someone else mentioned odd graphics ( hot dog dripping blue sauce , some sort pipe looking cartoons teeth . seriously , i no idea what those things might ) , but i say it workable if you sense humor (: yes , buttons small . i small hands , slender fingers , i still manage bump " 3 " whenever i'm trying shut off phone . sometimes it difficult turn ( button doesn't always respond when i push it , though could i'm wimp ) , but once it it fine . i'm thinking this get broken more use . all all , it not bad phone . beautiful red . i find myself staring it just appreciate its beauty ( phone confessions ! ) . i'm satisfied mine . since i haven't forked out hundreds dollars -- or any dollars , really -- i won't feel too guilty when/if i manage lose it under pile paperwork !	1

what it needs ... hell palm changes stylus every new model	1
i ordered this headset silver - webtreo sent out white , but said even though it appears white , it really silver ! we argued color , i finally convinced them samsung makes white , silver , red , black . it took almost month get resolved , but i finally silver headset i ordered . it very small , light , easy use . there 3 different size earpieces better fit . headset gets 4 stars , webtreo only gets 1 star . i wouldn't order any products them again	1
only problem it easy drop scrren smudges easil	1
i recently took chance this item , i am happy report its not bad ! i actually not looking forward swivel ( bad experience ) but swivel very solid . it looks good . skin not best , but i like it . only problem i it you take out phone completely order use it .	1
i nothing but good things say this purchase product . it works looks great . i only wish they could make pda phone wasn't big boat	1
i wasn't expecting lot this extremely inexpensive case , but i'm very impressed . i bought accessory one , total cost $4 . case fits nearly perfectly , every hole right size right place , not exact possible but everything works just well without case . others complained chipping paint but week i've using this it hasn't chipped yet . can't any better $$$	1
if you're looking slim cover won't add lot bulk your razr , this one great . no , it probably won't provide much protection if you drop your phone . it protect your razr scratches fingerprints , rubberized material easy grip feels great your hand . cutouts outside display , camera ( i v3m ) , logo perfectly placed whole cover fits well . i don't use belt clip , cover itself adds hardly any bulk so i just keep my phone my pocket . without belt clip , there small ' snap ' sticks out bit back cover but it really no big deal . $3 , you can't beat this . : -	1
thought i'd post this info here , since this subject still confuses people . i just talked cust care representative , who confirmed cancelling included data plan before 180-day period invalidate $250 amazon phone rebate . well , i guess major turn down me this phone this offer , since i don't really need data plan , planned use wifi connectivity most time . any comments ? i still would like give it 5 stars since i believe it great product . i'll take one star off however , due its weak battery life , lack standard audio connection ( 2.5 " or 3.5 " minijack ) .	1
many my colleague use blackberry emails but i give try this brand-new 3g/wi-fi/camera equipped smartphone . 3g wi-fi works very well our area . it also worked very well europe after activation cellphone cingular customer service . e-mail internet works very well both locations . addition 1gb microsd chip actually solve many bluetooth file transfer issues , since i simply stick microsd card into regular sd cassette , use card reader usb cable file transfer pc or mac like other memory chips . color calibration default focus camera very good video very good quality cameraphone . again , 1gb allow you take very long video windows media player format . installation good mail system automatically synchronize lotus note emails , contacts , calendar any time , any place , automatically chime schedule notices . only drawback battery life , which require frequent charges , slow keypad phone calls ( i not know how silence keypad ) , little tough keyboard touch . lack shift keys both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult ( especially shift+a ! ) . addition , microsoft word processing slow , so excel , which require faster chip . overall , great all-around pocket pc this generation	1
battery came quickly performs describe	1
i've my tracfone 5 months now . reception generally good . once i got phone activated , i haven't any problems . tracfone ' refer friend ' program give each 100 free minutes . all you send me email asking referral . my email debsclay@gmail.com thank you	1
product came promptly i am happy quality . however fitment wasn't perfect ends would sit little higher than my treo . not huge problem , but something i would feel everytime i reach stylus . but pen works pretty good , it feels sturdy my hands . i would definately recomment this product others	1
price good cable working well . i very good experience this cable .	1
i've this case under month , but it working great . when i first got case , i thought i going send it back because i thought it too small my phone(i lg cu500 cingular . ) . it pretty tight fit , but it worked . case since seemed stretch little so it lot easier get my phone out	1
cheap . simple . good looking . only thing missing belt clip . there stick belt clips work fine this	1
this best phone i ever . reception crystal clear , it also mp3 player , ablility add memory card . video , voice recording capabilities , 8x zoom camera . best all very , very user friendly .	1
i think this going very good phone , but advertized price this web site says retail some 800.00 + dollars . well i called nokiausa direct regular retail them 499.00 all day many you want , so it should considerably less amazon . you would think ? i guess not !	1
incredible price all three items . just car charger alone , verizon wanted $24.00 . plastic cover phone very good razr phone scratches pretty easily	1
this charger awesome . it very compact when retracted when cord extended , it doesn't get way like spiral cords . cord thin , not bulky . i never measured cord when extended , but it much longer than most	1
i like way it doesn't take up space console when i am not using it it seems charge l6 just fine ! no complaints devise or service amazon	1
car charger serves it purpose , it charges cell phone car or any cigarette lighter . design basic no hidden features . you just need make sure you plug connector right way . i would liked some type label would identifed it motorola compatible device . otherwise perfect gift !	1
not much say battery . i installed it - it works fine	1
i used forget my wallet but i always my blackberry so i bought this then since i take my phone every where but not my wallet this salved problem . this good people who forget their wallet or phone but remember bring other	1
this great little desktop charger pocket motorala v60 additional battery . however , it seems expensive what you get , not mention fact what text doesn't tell you you need * additional * ( expensive ? ) serial cable/adapter order use it your regular charger cable . unless you want charge additional battery same time , save money just get nifty travel charger folding plug bargain price ... just place phone down your desk or tabletop while it charges	1
product great products such samsung cell phone models : a630 , a850 , a950 , a970 , a930 , a990 , a645 , a870 . thin adapter makes this charger very easy plug into crowded outlets allow you charge your cellular phone home or office	1
picture quality sucks price . colors way freaky . screen perfect text but not pictures . viewing pictures this terrible . keyboard ackward first . manual needs much more detailed . sorta confusing use if not familliar palm pilots . i expected use it like typical pilot , where you write screen . this feature not implemented . overall , this very good phone . good reception , great sound quality !! speakerphone great ! neat features . worth $$	1
this good , thick screen protector stays solidly stuck your screen . i don't foresee it peeling ... ever . it slightly frosted surface cut down glare , but frosting impossible see when screen . i've washed mine , it comes out clean new sticky side stays sticky . just very careful not bend it all or stress it one place . it extremely sensitive bending if you bend it , it never go back . so extra careful	1
i it up running minutes my lg vx-8600 ( verizon ) . i downloaded bitpm free software use cable . i just followed installation instructions came cd comes cable . i clicked " discover phone " bitpm it automatically find phone . ( i didn't even need go look com port installation says because bitpm scans ports until it finds phone)note .. when installing , make sure you pick right driver .. if you xp , choose xp driver , not nt , or win98 or other driver . it part file name .. look xp driver file name .	1
i recently purchased black metal case my 8525 , few problems w/it . first belt clip kind small broke when i tried clip it my belt . second aluminum case isn't sturdiest , so now it sort bent ( referring hinge , i guess i've really rough my phone ) , but i just bend it back where it supposed ( referring hinge ) . but case what it supposed ... my phone looks performs just day i got it . when i informed vendor belt clip broke i just wanted new clip , instead i recieved full refund , so pleasant suprise . i actually liked it so much i bought my wife one when she got her phone	1
this great phone . pity you cant get subsidized version via carrier . bit pricey but worth it . great camera interface . super easy upload pictures straight flickr via phone . this top selling handset europe - but tricky get hold us which still relatively dark ages when it comes mobile technology	1
this phone all feature i wanted . camera takes really good picture . better than all phone i've seen so far . xenon flash really helps taking night pictures . i use own w800i this one takes way better pictures . it auto-focus other several fucntion i haven't used yet . mp3 player also very useful . i love how u just drag drop mp3 files phone . it also very easy navigate through phone functions . my computer no problem recognizing phone once drivers loaded . it just like plugging flash drive . screen very bright clear . screen resolution decent . it very easy customize also . i dl program online customize theme . battery lasted lot longer than i expected . usually last around 3-4 days . only complains i this phone headphones . walkman series way better headphones so when you get this make sure buy new headphones adapter . complain expensive memory stick micros . i couldn't use memory my w800i phone . i wish they use sd micros which cheaper more widely used	1
photo this premiun side case not photo . side case photo treo logo producto don't i	1
this case great protecting my treo , but downside i remove it case use it . i purchased it because i actually dropped my treo when walking it balanced my portfolio , now i clip it portfolio it secure safe , i don't run risk leaving it behind	1
this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1
driver install easy bitpim access works just fine . cable i received also charges phone ( vx8300 verizon ) .	1
i ordered this cable ( two them actually ) use lg 8300 . driver disc contains software 8300 only not 5300 . once loaded , it found phone easily . i used bitpim ( free program you find internet)to transfer data phone . price cable excellent . i unable locate data cable locally happy find one amazon , even though it only available through third party . all all , i recommend product those need cables lg 8300 . those wishing use it lg 5300 please aware there appears no driver included your phone .	1
got this couple weeks ago . rubber suit covers every bit phone so i am confident i won't getting any scratched . it flips open ok . you attach charger data cable just fine but ear peice jack seems little scrunched . you can't access tf card . there strap goes over top so your v710 definitely isn't going fall out . 3 minor qualms : see through plastic little glare it , especially when there oil lcd suit . also , it adds just enough weight it flips open little knock . ( noticed this most when phone horizontally mounted my belt ) . last , flap sort comes into field view camera . you already know v710 camera crap its specs , but i occasionally hold down little flap . i got used it real quick	1
top part telephone gets loose very often , elastic band apparently looses its elasticity easily	1
this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1
overall i'm happy skin . it fits treo 700 very closely . this custom formed every curve , bump , button treo . my one complaint they advertise it compatible 700w 700p . i should paid more attention pictures thought it . 700w , if you don't know , almost identical except buttons just below screen . button layout same , but they different icons purposes . well , skin images button covers 700w , not 700p . not huge deal , just slight annoyance . i'm going see if there way remove these somehow	1
this cable saves me lot money . i don't need buy stuff online when now i download it straight my pc . makes it easy transfer pictures , videos , ring tones , contact numbers . it great put things off . also great keeping back up	1
this holster far better than stock holster comes phone . it lower profile which means it sits closer your belt . it also much easier actuate than stock holster . thumb tab oriented just right direction easy in/out . phone clips solidly doesn't fall out	1
product functions well , looks good . if i could change one thing , swivel action just little looser than i would like , but definatly not problem	1
i highly recommend this bundle price . less than cost offical verizon travel charger , you get travel charger , home charger usb cable driver cd . everything works just fine . instructions usb cable very lacking , so here my suggestions : you use windows media player move music over your phone using sync feature , you use free program such bitpim other file transfers your pc phone .	1
if you want cell phone well made , looks good , feels good use really good phone opposed phone bunch other things v360 excellent choice . it enough features keep things interesting but easy use above all really good phone not sacrifice call quality or battery life bunch useless features i don't want . it also looks feels good thus pleasure use	1
i purchased this 24.99 steal ! pros : -clear voice clarity . nice signalseasy set up sync phoneruns nimh batteries . cons : -not good range . if cell my back pocket jean , blutetooth set doesnt work well there quite lot signal break up	1
this charger excellent value . it works beautifully my treo 700p smartphone . i love retractable cable quickly rewinds inside device touch button , making whole unit quick easy store . only complaint i've heard large , blue power light too bright night . it doesn't annoy me , but my wife asks me turn device sideways or upside down , so blue glow doesn't shine up into her eyes . no problem	1
this excellent product it protects my treo 650 without hiding its style . i chose treo because its unique look excellent features however , case palm didn't work me because i use phone lot i dont time put phone back case everytime . so , it gets thrown my purse other items which then scratch it . i also bought body glove case while i use phone while it , it hides treo real look plus typing keyboard covered plastic drag . this one seems even enhance treo style	1
good battery life ( certainly much better than old one it replaced ) . most part it indistinguishable original . however it doesn't fit quite snugly dock-style charger came my phone ( not kind plugs into bottom phone , but kind sits your desk contacts battery directly ) . little annoying it tends fall out -- if i'm not paying attention i'll wake up next morning my phone won't actually charged -- but it still works	1
item arrived quickly exactly advertised , charges phone 15 minutes driving	1
cable exactly what i needed , much more inexpensive than other alternatives . drivers provided accompanying cd worked but not complete i would liked . i am still very satisfied , it only cable i really after , especially price which i bought it	1
you might pay little bit more but reliability offered oem products gives one much peace mind . i am always willing wait little longer pay little more if i know what i am getting not just counterfeit . i think i got my money worth	1
great product - works quickly when charging my moto v555 car . highly recommend it	1
i just bought this case few weeks ago , it holding up very well . it hasn't broken or scratched yet . plus , it makes my phone looks lot better . well i hope this thing last many months down tough road . ciao	1
very good clip-type phone holder . came advertised quickly .	1
this product great ... i'm glad it came cloth , too	1
but it some faults . i it some time now , i got it my 11th birthday . i reviewed cingular version too , even though mines verizon . faults : very short battery life - i charge it almost every day ! camera - picture you take can't move or it comes out all messed up . good parts : big screen - easy read ! recording videos - even though you get 15 seconds , i still use make funny videos my friends . it style - i love color style ! my friends all jealous . overall , i think it great phone	1
much longer lasting than standard battery . fast shipping	1
this item very excellent . i suprise it not comes 2 screen protector only , but also squeegeem , cloth cleaning instructions . this shield fits very nicely over my phone screen	1
i am very satisfied holster my motorola phone ... i would recommend this holster anyone who needs one work phone easy carry get when needed ..	1
extra lithium battery ideal new i860 camera phone . desktop charger comes second charging slot so you always spare battery ready those last minute low battery alerts . it saves time one last thing worry . charge itself fast too .. i found 750 mah lithium ion battery dependable nomatter what stage remainng battery life you begin recharging . it doesn't weakin my i1000 battery when charging started mid range . however , first time you charge or recharge your lithium battery most important charge all . you must let initial or first chatge run out completey before begining recharge battery . " deader " battery it first run better life battery standby time charges come . highly recommended	1
two years now i not any problems my motorola i530 cell phone , which serviced telus-nextel . over all i would rate service good , not excellent . rarely i trouble getting service area where i would normally get strong signal . this problem normally last roughly under minute before my phone once again operational . i'm daily commuter canada united states . my phone doesn't miss beat , it automatically switch telus canadian server nextel american server still same great reception . cell phone itself big , bulky , heavy , ugly . it not come equipped any cool picture or video features . it direct connect feature so you use your phone like walky-talky when talking friend same option their phone . neat fun . reception phone clear crisp , it seldom cut out conversation . therefore i not expect quality sound down loaded music so poor . what most impressive phones durability . this cell phone really take beating . i dropped my phone numerous times . i thrown my phone across room friend who failed catch it more then once . one those fancy little phones would smashed into million peaces . road trip , my phone fallen off my lap , out car sat side road three days rain . i finally backtracked relocated my phone . i recharged phone it worked expected . my phone never let me down , i always gotten service , battery not died me thus far . battery when fully charged last thirty hours low moderate usage . if you looking quality phone built stand punishment not desire all those new phone gimmicks this phone you .	1
i'm very happy this case . i just looking simple belt carrier would protect my treo 700p , but would allow complete access treo when i wanted use it . other words , i didn't want something attached treo permanently . this trick . it simple , but looks good . seems solidly made well	1
motorola i560 nicely sized , easy use , indestructible . these features what look when looking new cell phone . not only i560 smaller than most bulky nextel or sprint phones , such i710 , but it unbreakable model outside display . this something new unbreakable model . size important , especially nextel , because most their early models very big awkward , like i710 . i560 perfectly massive tiny . this nice because it not vulnerable cracked screens antennas . it equipped gripping well which helps when it comes using direct connect , placing calls , receiving calls . i710 very smooth exterior . it nice looking , but harder keep your hand . more damage i710 because there no gripping . if , however , i560 slip out your hands , don't worry . dropping this phone not concern due extreme durability . if you worried scratching outside , get leather or plastic cover i t.t he ease use i560 i710 close because they very similar menu options simplicity ; however , big difference outside display i560 . without even opening phone , you place call pushing stop butt top phone scroll through your most recent calls . this safe feature use car . speaker phone clarity improved i560 . i710 speaker phone cuts out every third word , where i560 still not perfect aspect , but improvement better than nothing . durability cell phone essential . there nothing worse than take cell phone repair , or even worse , replace it . much use most people get out their cell phones , how it stands up daily wear tear vital satisfaction phone . i560 one unbreakable models nextel , exceptionally tough . when i710 dropped , it often goes blank screen causes problems reception service . i560 completely opposite . overall performance , mass , resilience i560 surpasses i710 . when compared , i560 better choice .	1
i've battery week now . simply love it . i'm heavy user gps applications power vision web-surfing go . i used charge phone twice day , now i charge it once day sometimes i even forget plug it night i still 2 bars battery left half way through day . even when i forget charge it hasn't died me . this great deal $16 + shipping vs . one sold sprint stores around $60	1
going charging my phone couple times day charging it once every couple days definitely changed opinion my a900 , making it less high-maintenance allowing me some web browsing , headset using , general multimedia mayhem without constant paranoid fears this fooling around cost me when oem battery decides die most inopportune time . quite cheap price freedom peace mind . it 12 hours thing yet change 3 bars . what !? aside piddling cost this battery ( which double tax you'd pay battery sprint dealership ) , there tax bulge it creates its backside . me , this not insignificant , but ignorable , it doesn't detract aesthetics phone it provides way grip it when dialing , talking , or using buttons	1
samsung a900 blade excellent phone . i say so many good things it . only bad thing it i encountered horrid battery life . battery life problem second i walked out sprint . nobody wants charge their phone 2-4 times day . standard battery a900 i charging my phone ridiculous amount times . but that what you get razor thin phone . so course i searched finally found this battery which crucial . this battery life saver . sure get this one because it cheapest i found , i extensive searching . also this one comes door which very crucial . i've seen some extended batteries sold without this door i almost made mistake buying one without door . you would screwed without door fits extended battery . what would you , put rubber band around it ? heck no . well anyway , now i this battery , my phone last all day without worries dying just like my previous models thick batteries . my a-900 still very thin even this extended battery sticks out little . don't worry , you're phone still look great this battery you enjoy all it features without dying	1
i palm tx which i loved , but didn't like go wifi sites web . i also moto v557 phone which best cell phone i've ever owned . i purchased treo best both worlds . i like treo 680 , but i read all instructions , call customer service practice using certain features not frustrated phone . example , i difficulty answering phone using touch screen practice pressing small send button . ( which i usually missed while rush answer phone . ) i like web because it fast enough i don't miss wifi . i get used fact many web sites aren't small enough phone , but it excellent using google maps , looking up business giving number easy dial ( just tap blue line ) , checking bank accounts , online orders , movies , weather especially news . email good too palm software . i didn't use express or getgood email . i absolutely love chat setting messaging . now , phone story . i miss ease dialing traditional cell . my bluetooth not work well 680 . people typically tell me they can't hear me so i now use corded ear bud . bluetooth doesn't work voice dial feature purchased separately . you can't insert hard pauses phone numbers require you dial extensions . there no way delete one digit time if you misdial number . you leave phone dialing page return redial . phone dials slowly if there other programs running . lastly , you can't check your calendar or other features after answering phone if key pad locked when you answered phone . you hang up person , unlock phone , check calendar call them back . battery life poor , but i keep charger car which helps great deal . all all , i love my treo 680 . i purchased additional software i strongly recommend . they : launcher x(excellent ) , mobil write , treo voice dialing , oxford dictionary thesaurus , scrabble mars needs cows . i also recommend you keep you treo locked security password . i not found carrier offer insurance this $400 phone	1
well i read through just every review prior purchasing this phone almost thinking twice it after reading some reviews here , but i decided take plunge go it . well i'm glad i . all i say this phone pleasure use get-go . it its flaws but what phone doesn't ? question whether you're going go flip out over alarm clock or volume strip or it trivial issue you . most gripes others just seem little me . let talk pros cons : pros : 1 . call quality excellent . no static what so ever . no dropped calls . my area good t-mobile coverage so i can't complain . phone it what it supposed . make good quality calls . it also pairs my bluetooth headset ( plantronics 510 ) really well . speaker phone good quality too . 2 . internet works great . i $5.99 plan yes edge isn't fastest but it gets job . it doesn't matter where i'm i check my email , finds restaurants or directions , or just surf web when i'm bored . it really came handy when i out vacation lost . wifi works well too . didn't want fork out money hotspots though . 3 . camera 1.3 megapixels decent quality . no it not going replace my regular camera but i found it really handy when i forgot take my camera my friend wedding , but still able take quality pictures . i haven't tried videos yet though . 4 . mp3/video player : now speakers this phone aren't greatest so i wouldn't use them listening music but when plugged into headset it sounds pretty good . i bought 2gb microsd card bought here amazon now i hold ton music movies . videos looks pretty nice i'd admit . this thing my travelinig entertainment center . i even found way play original nintendo games this thing trying mike tyson punchout like back old days . 5 . calendar/schedule : i pda but some reason i'm more compelled actually use my calendar keep my schedule this thing than i my pocket pc . probably because convenience reasons . 6 . smartphone applications : i'm medical field i keep all my medical applications this phone . i quickly look up drug references or research diseases . i really thought i'd need touchscreen order better navigate these programs while it might slightly easier stylus , i don't find it all necessary still navigate pretty well . i just wish processor slightly faster some these apps , but it more than adequate . i'm not sure why people don't think there lot programs smartphone . programs written wm5 compatable ppc well smartphones equally . [ ... ] . 7 . appearance : everyone who sees this phone absolutely loves its looks so i . it looks great feels great . i saw this side side motorola just looked so much bulkier ... well ... not nice . rubber backing feels awesome . 8 . battery : all i use this phone it makes it through day plenty battery spare which all i really ask . i wouldn't go 2 days without charging battery though . you should charge it every night . cons : 1 . windows mobile 5 : mighty microsoft needs write cleaner program . however windows mobile 6 way free download t-mobile customer soon so hopefully that'll take care some problems . i swear just turn bluetooth pair up my bluetooth device takes me whole minute just because how hard it navigate wm 5.2 . volume strip : yeah like everyone says it sucks . i disabled mine . adjusting volume this thing tedious best . luckily my music/video programs well my stereo headset allow me easier ways adjust volume so it not such issue me . 3 . alarm clock : now i don't use this all much but i see what everyone says it yeah it pretty idiotic written program . however rather than writing half page how bad it i downloaded free one internet works great so my life now goes . summary : so i use this device make quality phone calls , surf web , check email , play games , listen music , watch movies , monitor my schedule , check my medical references , take decent quality pictures . all this thing needs now laser beam cut through metal it'd greatest gadget known man	1
this my first smartphone i've lot fun it so far . so small , keys remarkably easy use . i often connect it my laptop via usb cable . if you windows xp ms activesync 4.2.0 , your pc/laptop recognize it network device . little bonus app dash lets you share internet connection ( granted you data plan ) no extra cost . if you get add-on micro sd card ( $80 ) , you'll no need buy ipod . windows media player ( which comes standard ) works just well . it built 802.11 ( or ? ) card . when i'm range wi-fi , i use skype save my minutes . i hope t-mobile doesn't read this since they'll probably patch loophole :) few cons : -there no scroll wheel like blackberry . -the battery charge doesn't last longer than day or so if you've got data push outlook enabled . if i forget charge it night , i'm sol . -the volume strip righthand side drives me nuts . i'm constantly hitting it mistake . when i , annoying popup interrupts whatever i'm doing . you disable volume strip , but it kindof important certain apps like skype windows media player . simple classic volume dial side would huge improvement . strip never seems work right when i really intend adjust volume . -the keyboard nice , but touch screen would better certain apps . there no way cut-and-paste	1
headset works fine , people who i talk says they get better sound so wind prevention goes well , but i doubt battery stand 7 hours talk time , also it not too easy put it your ear other headset	1
note : i am transitioning using sony ericsson p910i smartphone so my review based how well w710i features work comparison . i purchased this because i go remote areas p910i needs heavy bandwidth order phone function . my son z500 would work areas my p910i would not . review based 1 week usage . i've also purchased z710i my son review one later . strengths : * improved picture quality 2.0 megapixels vs . 1.3 *excellent voice quality headsets ( wired or bluetooth)*text , sms , mms*shortcut buttons quickly use 4 your most used features*battery life outstanding*mp3 player*rss reader*bluetooth synchronization files*ability set up phone non-english languages*ability buy international sim card avoid extra fees*sync cord charges battery*can double modem via bluetooth or usb cable ( if you don't unlimited internet package very careful they charge big $$$)*fm radio - reception so-so downtown area*standard or flight mode option use while airplane*edge technology - my p10i not this . i download email extremely quickly now !!! *step counter calories expendedneutral : * international charger adapter us outlets . it very wobbly outlet . i'll invest us version . * inability sync any computer using windows vista ( i'm sure workaround coming)*i haven't used armband yet but it may improve stepcounter accuracy . * others warned holdling phone interferring antenna , i haven't problem this . * over-the-ear earbuds don't fall out ! weaknesses : * since i other sony phones , i am disappointed they changed shape connection sync charger . translation , you no longer use current chargers previous generation phones . * there no way charge phone use wired headset . you either listen radio or charge phone . * you not use standard over-the-counter headsets because there no outlet it . * need switch settings view more than one email account*yet memory card format ( micro)another adapter needed*memory card only 512mb ( purchase 1 or 2gb)*picture caller id only works after you open phone ( edit march 21 , 2007 - if you answer open set)i purchased my w710i internet company $254.00 it shipped directly hong kong 2 business days . i'm unsure if i provide their name here . overall : sony always produced quality products . i love this phone it very good comparison smartphone . i miss using my styllus . if you don't need bells whistles smartphone , go z710i it bit cheaper but great contender . if i could rate it more than 5 stars , i would even though i haven't tried all features this phone . buy it without hesitation ! addendum march 5 , 2007i dropped phone tiled bathroom floor . when it hit , clip , battery cover battery scattered different directions floor . amazingly , phone still operates . damage barely noticeable mark upper left phone . mark like could happen my purse ! i am really impressed now but hope i never again !	1

many people issues 2.5 mm 3.5 mm adapters treos . this adapter works fine my treo 650 . plugs fit fine ( i got 2 pack ) i get stereo sound through both headphones . if you not headphones proper impedance you not get stereo sound . my crappy panasonic headphones better sony ( isolation ) headphones work fine this adapter . maybe i'm just lucky , but this low price , this adapter fine . if you want sterling sound you shouldn't listening mp3 anyway . i hear limitations my files treo , so it clearly good enough	1

this better than we thought it would . even though keys covered , it still pretty tactile . would liked something protect screen . overall , great protection price . looks better in-hand than pictures on-line	1
me main problems all headsets come receiving end either : . feedback loop : where other person hears themself speakb . ambient noise : other end hears everything around you , especially carin minimizing these , mobile freedom bluetooth best . i've tested my other 3 headsets people same call this one ranks highest voice clarity without extraneous noises . me , i hear everyone fine all headsets , but conversation two-way street if you've ever used headset , i'm sure you're tired hearing , " take me off stupid thing ! " negatives this headset far outweighed call clarity . yes , it big ugly , but your friends thank you . other negative aware ( although i assume this more due age my headset it only recently started doing this ) i've found after 1 year , while battery still holds charge well , it sometimes drops link phone when i hang up after call i can't get it back until i recharge thing . like i said , it getting bit old though . overall , if i going buy new one , i'd get this one . far other 3 tested , i'll rank them order call quality ( best worst ) . plantronics discovery 655 ( not too bad , but hard keep your ear)jensen stereo headphones wbb100rx ( more wireless stereo headphones than calling)motorola hs850 ( looks cool , but total piece garbage) p.s. if you're wondering why i 4 headsets it because there nothing worse than losing use one your hands while talking phone . 1 car , 1 home , 1 ... well you get picture .	1
top line : this best blackberry i've ever used , among best phones i've ever used . i use it work after hours out compromise functionality style/size . i've ( some what grudgingly ) using blackberry since first " pager-style " 4 line text device 8100 breakthrough me . finally , i corporate device treats me like consumer ! good : - great voice dial : particularly if you commuter headset . no need record your voice each address entry- just say who you want call it it doesn't understand you it prompt you more info . - size appearance : finally i don't look like dork talking something size my palm . phone small many phone-only candy bars . - easy private email set-up ( all modern blackberries ) . seems some sort auto set-up mac mail gmail , others too i imagine- macintosh compatibility : i just bought " missing sync " apple mac os ($40 usd ) synchronize my address book , calendar , tasks notes my macbook pro . works great ! software provided rim not very easy use . - fantastic screen innovative " outlook today " style summery screen missed calls , latest emails etc . look this feature one alternate themes ships phone . - others mentioned , keyboard very good . coming full size bb keyboard , i thought i might miss it , but 8100 breeze use . not good : - speaker phone functional sound quality general fine . nothing like my sony ericsson though ... - i think i minor voice quality issue phone my motorola h700 headset ( best headset i've ever owned ) . i think it might compatibility issue . - more mac compatibility would appreciated - like native isync bluetooth support	1
i've this phone week now i'm glad i waited post review because my initial reaction not very positive . coming owning razr many windows-based devices , there initial learning curve some functions . also , i not convinced strange keyboard would really recognize what you attempting type . boy i wrong one . ok , so review . my motivation purchasing primarily get phone first , few bells whistles when i just want play device . pearl fits bill perfectly . phone quality excellent . loading ringtones ( pain first ) proved relatively easy once i little research . ringtones play very loud clear . music player much better than first impressions would lead you believe . after few hours frustration , i all ready purchase 3rd party app . again , some research , visited few forums , found out there much more functionality included music player than you might realize . owner nano , i disappointed interface player . but once you go into menu functions , you'll find much more functionality . it not ipod , but it works decent replacement . if you're not ipod owner , you'll likely no complaints . sound tunes quite nice when using headphones . camera only so-so , but i don't really care anyway . must admit i thought it would better since it megapixal camera . couple pictures i took dark somewhat grainy . part why i dropped my rating 5 stars . far email , i bb work they won't let me use non-work issued device access network , so i no opinion email functionality . organizer features ( calendar , tasks , notes , etc ) seem more than adequate . much better than any my old pocket pc devices . only complaints i would there still 2 basic things i haven't able figure out while i'm admittingly not techie , these should pretty basic intuitive . one , i would like set one my ringtones default ringer . should fairly simplistic but i can't figure it out . two , i would like change order icons some themes . again , should pretty basic , but no go . almost forgot , can't listen music through bluetooth . not sure why , but this really my only major complaint . only minor complaints . all all , pretty sweet device . btw , form factor looks simply best out there . i came so close purchasing blackjack , very happy i went pearl . update - figured out how set default ringtone move icons . coming windows mobile environment , i expecting something lines : start-programs-etc-etc . everyting windows takes so many keystroks . pearl , it so easy . i simply expecting it much more difficult based my prior experience . i'm going still keep it 4 stars because lack bt stereo . otherwise , close perfect device i've used ( i've used quite few )	1
this product perfect , all i needed move pictures my phone my pc . highly recommended .	1
this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1
overall i'm happy skin . it fits treo 700 very closely . this custom formed every curve , bump , button treo . my one complaint they advertise it compatible 700w 700p . i should paid more attention pictures thought it . 700w , if you don't know , almost identical except buttons just below screen . button layout same , but they different icons purposes . well , skin images button covers 700w , not 700p . not huge deal , just slight annoyance . i'm going see if there way remove these somehow	1
this phone great ! it all basic features i wanted out phone i able fix low ringtone problem searching " audiovox 8610 hack " over internet . you purchase cable ebay d/l some free softwares over net . then you make all ringtones you ever wanted free . course you computer-savey so . so don't it unless you know what you're doing . phone allows 20 seconds mp3 midi playback each ringtone . cool thing each ringtone attached phone number phonebook so you know who calling ring . i downloaded bunch sound effects wav files net mix ' match them into mp3 file some great ringtones . example : 3 stooges sound + bell ring + whistle + homer " doh " + wolf howl - all one 20 second ringtone . i also made some ringtones out my favorite rock songs well . i noticed some songs sound-effects louder than others . thus i only keep loudest ringtone they're very loud ! i only set sound volume 3 i hear ring my pocket backpack . overall , this phone always sale places like target . if you make your own ringtone download it into phone , you all free custom ringtones you could ever dream	1
i bought my cell through auction site 2 months ago , so i got good deal it . well , some mentioned phone shutdown me only once while i using qwerty keyboard . other than i no problems , call reception great . camera this phone isn't greatest but i don't need it high end basic fun pics i take . if you're looking get zoom , larger , clearer pictures this isn't phone you . camera screens bit confusing but i've learned deal it my pics come out i like . strange feature speakerphone , while it quite loud clear , kyocera placed it inner flip side phone which muffles sound . aside these things , i love my switchback . qwerty keyboard perfect txting but may too cumbersome larger fingers keys small . far plans concerned i don't any problems w/ over charges since i 18 cents/min plan . it good know monthly plans aren't recommended though . bonus per minute plans sugar mama service , where you get free airtime giving your opinion minute video clips . good purchasing games or ringtones w/o using up your top-up money . this cell isn't only young crowd , i'm over 25 mom . i got this phone b/c other carriers hardly carry qwerty phones those require addt'l internet service plans ( like blackberry , black jack palm treo ) . i only wanted easily send txts it one compact phone . this ideal me	1
i purchase this phone both my wife i , we both love them . windows mobile 5 takes little time learn navigate , but very versatile functional . reception call quality great , pairing bluetooth headset quick painless . screen bright crisp . there no 3g my area , but edge works good speed bearable simple web browsing . media player works well . battery life good 3g turned off . this phone comes both standard extended battery . pretty heavy usage , i still 1/2 battery power night . 3g said really suck power , though . lots lots 3rd party software available make this phone pretty much whatever you want	1
product ok , don't think it'd protect you phone if you dropped it while standing up . but it aesthetically appealing , protect small scuffs scrathes	1
you pretty much anything you would like this product !! only draw back i could find it doesnt charge while you it plugged . other then , you manager anything you would like	1
silicone protective covering treo exactly what i wanted just what i expected it . it fits my treo 650 perfectly i couldn't happier . i am going buy different color	1
compared " face out " belt clip i previously , this " face " version proved bit more stable sturdy so far . hopefully , it remain so . price , it not too hard appreciate .	1
this great cover sansa mp3 player . it heavy duty rubber thin where it thicker all necessary places . it hard plastic screen shield protects sansa screen scratching or shattering . you'd silly not purchase this $20 case protect your $150+ investmen t.t he one downside i forsee cover too thick bottom allow player sit most cradles , docks , or speakers . it not difficult put case , but it would frustrating take it off often . just something consider if you see yourself using player docks or speakers often . standard usb cable come product works great toughskin	1
while i thankfully haven't test protective qualities this product , it appears it job nicely . only thing i would change give it fixed belt clip	1
i really like this protective cover . it very well made , seems like it excellent job protecting sansa even fall . funny thing now it toughskin i am much less likely drop it . before i bought toughskin , my e280 very slippery easily dropped . now it case , it very easy hold grip very little pressure . it true buttons easier push toughskin than it without it . hard plastic screen cover surprising positive this case well . only problem screen cover seems scratch more easily than i would expect . overall , this excellent product i would not hesitate recommend	1
i little skeptical buying this case my phone . i wanted holster wasn't sloppy generic model didn't fit . i absolutely pleased when this one arrived i tried it my motorola v180 . it fits like glove looks good . no complaints here . so if you v180 your fence taking plunge buying this let me assure you , you won't disappointed . added bonus money you save over buying one your cell phone dealer :	1
this all folks who got free or nearly free motorola v180 - spend money this case protect your phone ! i looked many different cases stores online hoping find something handsome but even more importantly - really protective . v180 apparently few comments home screen going ka-plooky - ' nuf said - i needed better grade , clear interior protector screen touchpad . sydney harbour gets high marks this feature - not flimsy dull plastic but very clear , quality stuff . secondly , super-soft , matte black leather sweet fit - nice snug , form-fitting no feel strain or awkward stretching . cut outs perfectly lined up too - there one speaker phone feature back ( not mentioned ads ) . snap antenna loop it gives whole thing very nice custom look feel . sure this might look like lot review simple product - but if you're like me only allow few little bits finery your life , you try make smart carefully considered purchases . nice yourself your phone - go sydney harbour avoid cheaper stuff	1

i love my blackberry pearl my swivel case icing proverbial cake . good quality swivel mechanism appears potential last long time , something prior holsters failed . i also like magnetic closure , which snaps closed securely quickly once i place my pearl into case , without need finding snap fitting . my older blackberries cases which , after use , their entries obstructed flaps fold over causing me use " two-handed " method nesting my phone , one hand move flap out way , other insert phone into case . this very frustrating occurence since i am usually attempting more-preferred " one-handed " approach . although still relatively new , my new case appears no such appendage which might later date become worn tired thereby causing obstruction . before i purchased my leather swivel case , i looked 3rd party generic cases . each these unable " notify " my blackberry it its holster . my new swivel case , soon i insert my pearl , display shuts off thereby extending battery life . addition , this feature allows different profiles selected when my bb holstered or not . also , since this oem case , it made especially my pearl . when holsetered , both usb connector , earphone outlets volume control buttons all accessible . non-oem cases , order use hands free device or charge my phone , i might remove phone its case . i am little disappointed pearl came no case all . this probably due its small size your ability just slip phone into your shirt pocket , unlike prior blackberry devices . course , still exposes vulnerable display significant scratch-potential . they should least provided simple pouch , which would provide some protection . this course comment pearl itself not swivel case , which subject this review . all-in-all , i highly recommend this case those you who still wear your phones your belt ... since i'm it , i love my pearl	1
though still not quite enough battery juice-sucking , it worlds better than included battery . i would love see clip back attach original battery well swap when extended one dies	1
i really like this case ! it easy put take off . it not stupid plastic cover over screen . it not add lot bulk my phone i think it makes my phone easier hold . i would like more colors . i would really like something glow dark , so i could find it easier black hole my purse .	1
believe it or not , i consider going blackjack treo 680 upgrade . i guess whole battery problem depends usage person . my battery problem i cant kill darn thing ! i am one those people depletes battery completely before recharging it . i it my laptop my ipod pda i before blackjack , tungsten 2e . devoted palm users absolutely dispise windows mobile 5 available blackjacks . mainly because you not create edit word , excel or pdf files biggest problem me its complete depndence outlook . which i absolutley not put up . even contacts wouldn't backup ! needless say , treo 680 saved me . if you go way blackjack without outlook , look into sbsh programs facade papyrus . however , if you go lovely treo check out " dialbyphoto " i think coolest part how you set up " favorite 5 " like tmobile offers but still all reliability cingular	1

bought this replace my three-year-old cell phone ancient but still working palm iiic . my observations after 30 days ownership : 1 . setup time consuming but unavoidable . patience required . i've couple questions i asked cingular , only forwarded palm , only forwarded microsoft , then back cingular . it seems no customer service department really mastered this unit . 2 . soft reset every once while . unit turns off sound itself only way i've found fix it soft reset . 3 . i'm not crazy microsoft outlook calendar compared palm . i miss several palm features , like " go " " today " buttons . outlook calendar just isn't easy manuever palm . 4 . phone listening volume low , especially when unit protective case , which puts it little further your ear . 5 . love bluetooth option . it new me it just great . 6 . love able press picture make call . we five kids ; i each kid picture linked their phone number . even my technology-challenged husband call them simply pressing their picture . 7 . this phone talks ! female voice announces who calling when your next appointment . first time she spoke it scared me death . voice reminds me computer star trek -- but not clear . however , after getting used her accent , she intelligible , which means computer translating my written input into spoken words -- amazing ! 8 . internet connection limited use me . i don't need email run i could live without this extra monthly cost . most traditional internet web sites take much too long load display too small portion page useful . it nice check weather or get directions go . 9 . can't imagine watching movie or any complex video this tiny screen . what point ? 10 . splurged sweet little vaja leather case wonderful . very expensive , but terrific luxury . 11 . amazon prices best far this product ! saved over $300 off my local retail cingular dealer . 12 . best part : i no longer carry pda cell phone ! they one same ! 13 . conclusion : this phone very smart fun use , although it comes big learning curve . low volume issue could problem someone bad hearing	1
