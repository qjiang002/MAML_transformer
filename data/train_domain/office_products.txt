i bought small one these blank , unlined pages pocket sketchbook . pocket sketchbooks commonly sold art supply stores one two varieties , either wire-bound or stitched . thing , wire-bound notebooks uncomfortable back pocket ( i just don't like feel , bumping up against ridges wires edge ) , most stitched bindings don't fold well moleskine ( folding nice wide so there plenty blank page use ) . honest , i may've fallen just little pompous tripe sketchbook great artists . thing , paper terrible . all ' bloggers geeks i've heard raving these notebooks use them their laundry lists or their ideas write or god knows what . while i'm not best artist around , i minor fine arts school , so i'm not completely clueless . so take my word ( or don't; it your loss ); paper just plain bad . most drawing paper some degree " tooth " -- roughness paper , which rubs off your graphite or charcoal smoothly onto page . tooth these sketchbooks nonexistent . rather than describe more detail paper , however , i believe i give apt description two words . manila folder . that what paper these books like , so nearly indistinguishable ( slightly smoother , fact , than manila folders -- even less tooth ) . while paper quality something personal preference , i've never seen anyone use any paper remotely similar this drawing , so i question claim these pads identical those used picasso et al . positive note , binding great , covers great , elastic strap , bookmark ribbon , back pocket all great features . but when it comes down it , i care most paper quality . if you want just write , get one these . if you intend any serious drawing , don't bother .	-1
this great address book , but you should know price coming out factory $9.95 , not higher prices cited this listing	-1
poor communication . i notified printer not coming when they said it would , but never given date . after waiting some time i cancelled order said i ordered one someone else . i guess they don't read their email either . next day they shipped item . now i two , but am not going spend $20 ship it back them . believe me i would never buy this company again	-1

throughout years i used owned many different versions brita pitcher water dispenser . all these filtered water containers great . only complaint i ever these filters size . brita ultramax water filter dispenser supposed answer this problem . unfortunately due bad design , it introduced multitude problems never existed past brita products . pro : size : this water dispenser definitely hold lot water . ( ironically , this really disadvantage ; you find below . ) con(s ): mold : if you not let this filter dry within maximum two days , you get mold . this mold probably make you ill ( sore throat ) ( conversely if you look it point view - it strengthen your immune system ) . avoid this problem , water dispenser should washed every week very least ( safe you should wash it more often ) . i never this problem brita other products ( i friends who never washed their brita pitchers months , there not even slightest sign mold when they wash it ) . left over water : due faulty design product , there left over water both above filter below it . besides turning product upside down , you cannot dispense all water . this just stupid hints lack quality assurance testing this product . not surprisingly , this helps further contribute mold growth . conclusion : save your money buy brita other well designed pitchers or even pure pitchers . ( key word pitcher . ) you only waste time possibly your health this poorly designed product	-1
planner nice , but i charged $6.25 shipping ! rip off !!	-1

this got most poorly manufactured item i bought long time . six plastic deviders either cut too short so they wont fit into both groves spanning opening , or bowed arc shape . so my 31 day monthly organizer now 16 or 17 day organizer . you would think someone would check quality something they going attach their name too sell	-1

i purchased this mount hang 15 " lcd tv , weighing less than 9 pounds ( specifications rate it up 33 lbs ) . i carefully measured used level mount swing arm wall , but when i hung tv , position arms small amount " give " arm segments caused tv hang slight , but noticable , angle . you tighten arm segment joints , which helps problem somewhat , but you won't able swing arm around once tightened . swivel adjustments only allow you change side-to-side angle vertical tilt , there no way fix rotation set .	-1

i'm very disappointed this shredder . i got it back october 2006 , i only used it 3 or 4 times . first all , although product supposed shred up 5 sheets time - it not . it get jammed , so i only shred 1 or 2 sheets time . tonight i used it again , it became completely jammed few sheets . i cannot get it work again . it very loud bit slow , but i live , i just don't like fact it jams after only using it few times . i recommend others spend few extra dollars get reliable shredder , unlike royal " 5-sheet " crosscut shredder ht500x	-1
we royal 8 months , used it sparingly made sure not overload it it stopped working . we read reviews prior purchase it recommended then find other reviews now support our experience . stay away this shredder .	-1

i beat hell out everything i own . my pda which this partially replaced aluminum hardshell case metal body . i broken just every watch i ever owned ( i have/had few excellent watches ) . i am naturally hard things due my focus life not my gear . this little notebook kept itself together so far , while looking very hip . i am software engineer/project manager am cognisant my technological options , this just faster , lighter thinner than my pda scribbling notes . i am never without it office . back folio pocket elastic strap looked dumb when i first bought it . however , i use folio pocket receipts reimmbursed ( better than leaving them pocket washed or thrown out)and elastic strap serves double duty second bookmark keep notebook together ( keeping it closed helps it survive ) . i like construction archival quality book . my notes look more like those disorganized madman than manager ( i am starting wonder if they synonomous ) but if i ever refer back them i assured they there long time . it only received 4 stars because they [ ... ] piece my current scrawling rate , i probably need 4 or 5 year . just get your company pay it if you , because they notebooks you rely there long while . lastly : person who likes their montblanc notebook tear out pages , they partially missing point . these books archiving keeping records ( questionable usefulness my case ) not making quick throw away notes . i also highly doubt their notebook thin one these either . each their own place	-1
this book many others attempt duplicate but simply cannot . addition cool little features like elastic band ( keeps book closed when stuffed full other found items papers ) , pocket back durable cover this very well made book . student book making , this classic piece . most books nowadays form " perfect binding " where pages just glued spine . needless say this non-archival non-durable it gets . moleskine they classic way : pages folded sewn together signatures then sewn binding . they last forever , which why we still sketchbooks around likes van gogh , etc . overall great choice , i recommend it constantly	1

i write noodler black ( brand " standard " black ink ) almost every day because i can't always choose paper write . noodler black used two-sided writing bad paper , even newsprint , which rare among all fountain pen inks world . i also write noodler black because it waterproof , forgery-proof , good-looking , pleasantly smooth during writing . i confidently write checks noodler black , it safe signing valuable or important documents too ( when black acceptable color ; ask your lawyer ) . please keep mind noodler company carefully says which brand colors waterproof which not . my experience noodler black far best noodler color writing both sides bad paper . one behavior you might notice , if your pen nib exposed metal surface ( not covered colored enamel ) , noodler ( standard ) black spreads itself over exposed metal surfaces . this " nib creep " harmless behavior because ink doesn't run down onto grip area . wiping ink off nib only temporary ; more ink soon spread replace what you wiped off . again , this harmless behavior very small price pay security your marks , signatures important handwritten texts	1

( whole sheet transfer , i first iron around transfer set it down ; then i press increments three inches five long seconds , all way across , making four or five rows presses get top bottom , then start all over again going up down , making four or five rows presses get one side other . i press lift , rather than pushing . when i'm pressing , i move iron kind circular pattern all around transfer again , pressing firmly . then i lift up one edge peel it back ways check tranfser . if it looks good , i warm it up again where i'm going peel , then start peeling , let iron follow me so transfer doesn't cool down i'm peeling so i don't get shiny edges . phew what pain ***.) anyways , just when i really got hang it , my supplier let me down i couldn't get my professional paper time weekend . so i went back hp , using same technique . it burned first time , so i set iron half number under what i it set before , didn't iron it quite long . it looked really good , but i wanted see if transfer strong enough , so instead waiting , i threw it right washer ( inside out , cold water , no bleach ; knits-delicates setting dryer ) . i surprised how soft it ! i couldn't even tell it transfer , color good ! so it wasn't hp problem initially , it me . if you're gonna use this stuff ( or any iron-on transfer ) , best thing i tell you experiment old shirt . try hottest setting first , turn it down if it burns . ( you'll know you've burned when you see something like tea stain your shirt , it feels bit fuzzy , you'll see part your graphic left behind transfer paper when you peel it off - i think that because instead ink going into shirt , it burns back into paper . ) sure count seconds make sure every inch transfer gets even , hard press . i found cracking mainly due iron not hot enough , not pressing down hard enough . polymers gotta sqooshed into fabric . also , i iron onto nice smooth piece wood , i don't use pillow case or anything shirt wood , i stretch shirt very slightly tuck it so it doesn't move when i iron . then i let shirt cool down slowly , before i take it off wood ( thinking if it cools down too fast , might make it crack more ) . before i got new iron , i ironing piece sheet metal top wood conduct heat . better , but new iron , getting temperature right , ironing hard evenly , trick me .	-1

what it : this " charmin ultra bathroom tissue " very soft , absorbent , long lasting , terrific value . shortcomings scott standard mainstay , roughness , not concern here . " charmin ultra " nearly perfect every way . new " gold standard " bathroom , arguably become " charmin ultra " especially if your needs require softer tissue than scott . scott standard bathroom tissue stronger than charmin ultra , but " charmin ultra " strength ample intended use product . 2-ply construction makes 200 sheet rolls go much farther than one might expect add body mass product . add this extra absorbency " charmin ultra " over scott , i would say " charmin ultra " clear edge . bottom line : basically , these two products compare much like " bounty " versus " viva " paper towels . while both products score high marks every area there significant differences . bounty stonger viva softer , making both choices excellent but dependent needs individual consumer . results our in-house trial this charmin " scott extra soft " : we compared " charmin ultra " " scott super-soft " what turned out no-contest event . " charmin ultra " much softer than " scott extra-soft " , though " scott extra-soft " improvement over their standard product , but still quite rough .

i've recently swapped sitting desk ( which i nearly 20 years ) working " stand-up " desk . i found standing office carpets , even while wearing comfortable shoes , tough - i would barely last 5 10 minutes . accumulative effects enough i doubted i would get acclimatized anytime soon . tried this mat week now , i found i stand it 20 minutes or more time straight away . even end 20 minutes my feet don't feel bad - i am just sitting point because i am sick standing , not because i sit . rather than move mat out way , i am allowing my chair roll over it . it not conducive rolling ( high chair i don't leverage move it much even normal carpet - mat i no hope ) . when i move chair away , i see definite indents mat where wheels , however these spring back within 5 minutes or so . this excellent purchase far i am concerned	1
well , it sounds funny , but it sure pretty . i wanted make my own beads because some i purchased making jewelry lost their outer coating turned white ! these glass beads .... i found sculpey ordered 10 pack see how it would work . colors beautiful clay holds its shape , mixes well marbling blends form additional colors . make your creations permanent , just bake them your oven low temperatures . easy this , sculpey baking instructions ( use glass , 15 minutes per 1/4 inch , etc ., ) little too specific my taste . beginner , i find it troublesome some things i am baking may thicker than others therefore undercooked , or thinner ones may burn if i try compensate , so i bake them separately ? @ ! * ! or what ? i notice old handers just seem lower temperature cook everything 30 minutes . i'm not brave yet . but so far , nothing burned nothing turned back raw clay so i must doing something right . or sculpey more cooperative than its makers know .... i'm actually quite proud some my beads now , i've if less than month . sculpey get you off good start too	1

i am big fan pilot precise v5 v7 rolling pens . their stark black ink(as well other beautiful saturated colors ) incredible . people know me using this pen . it makes your handwritten papers letters oh so attractive professional . well , there no skipping or ink clots ( you know when regular ball pen stops writing then all sudden yucky ink clot smears appears your paper ! ) . not pilot precise . well they rival any art pen when drawing sketches , cartoons , anime , lettering . etc . i cant thank them enough making such beautiful pen . ( i like simple design ... no fancy schmancy rubber grip , or thick barrel ... just smart see through barrel indicator ) buy them you wont disappointed .	1
let me tell you how wonderful these pens : whenever i'm writing pen , i find myself longing pilot v5 . after writing these 7 years , there just nothing else compares . me , pilot most conducive pen getting thoughts my head onto paper . it smooth fluid , writes epitome ease precision , nice minimalist look . i'v graduated buying these boxes rather than just single pens because i hate without them use quot ; otherquot ; pens . once you try v5 , you'll know what i mean	1

first , let me say i love fountain pens -- all types , but especially sheaffers . colleague mine turned me lamy pens they've become my workhorses . i teach english so i grade many , many papers i refuse write boring pen . i used use my antique shaeffers until student almost dropped one . i daily pen , well , near disposable . i remembered lamy ordered safari . now , if something happens it , i don't stroke . plus , broad nib wonderful ink flow ! i give them gifts . they good pen start using they very forgiving . they write well my older pens ? nope . they more user-friendly ? yup . ( think mid 60 jaguar e-type versus 2005 honda civic . which more fun drive ? which would you drive grocery store ? get my point ? )bottom line : it $25 pen you'll use more than your $100+ antique pens .	1
former kgb agent formerly stationed former czechoslovakia , i can't tell you how useful moleskine city notebook : prague would me back when i junior agent just beginning my career former prague bureau . i remember one time i supposed tail dissident his way meet his cia contact . i followed guy over charles bridge towards old town , but then lost him crowd near town square . i went back bureau shame-faced , but my understanding superior told me write up detailed report what i saw where . i sat down write report , i realized without accurate map or detailed notes , i could not reconstruct what i witnessed , so i made something up . i ended up making up many my reports , mostly due my poor organizational skills . if i my maps notes one , compact convenient notebook , i might saved myself lot trouble . my understanding superior became much less understanding when he found out i writing fiction , soon i found myself noril'sk , siberia , north arctic circle , where i seen people eyeballs freeze their heads . after soviet union collapsed , i packed my things left kgb , but idea revisiting prague never left my thoughts . this time , however , i plan my moleskine city notebook : prague me , you sure whatever notes i write nothing dissidents or defectors , everything best restaurants , oldest architecture , warmest hotels prague offer	1

this review avery 3279 ink jet dark t-shirt transfers . but i wouldn't surprised discover rest stuff they make also junk . this stuff expensive .... over $15 five sheets office depot . i put brand new ink cartridge just couple days prior ( hp psc 1410 inkjet ) it working fine normal paper . read all directions carefully more than once . first time , paper cut off top portion image ..... sure , blame it printer ; but if so , why didn't normal paper this ? second time , it printed really wimpy hazy grey .... yet i set printer use maximum dpi ! i thought , " ok , maybe it darken heat iron . set kitchen timer , ironed it exactly instructed .... it still sickening hazy grey instead crisp black i wanted ! some darkness fabric below showing through white portions . oh yes ... it incredibly difficult peel off backing ... you end up tear portion design you create , pretty much ruining it . so .... wasted time shopping this . overpaid product . wasted hours prepping image . now i ruined tote bag can't replaced . avery scum , i hate you	-1
this stand nicely designed terms function , it also looks very appealing . problem there no assembly instructions , just few pictures , design faulty assembly . instance , hardware attach wrong way bottom smaller shelf when it would easy design it so hardware only go one way ; it took 90 minutes assemble 2 skilled men because pole each shelf didn't fit well into mainframe poles ( we use soap three people holding pushing ) , stand some gashes it though it advertised new . changing height this stand takes 2 people because first it won't move , then it falls hits your knee . now it together , we're using it , but what price	1

i very excited this product , given good reviews . however , i found refilling pencil took so much force i afraid i'd break it . even worse , eraser useless , due both design material . if i could find replacement eraser taller better , this would much better product . if i carry this plus separate eraser , it not really saving me much . oh , highlighter isn't marker . maybe i'm stupid , but i assumed it would . it just orange ink pen , which not same any other highlighter i'd choose use	1

this heater died after month usage . i would rather go walmart buy cheap one ( which i ) it lasted me 2 months so far ( heavy usage ) . if one breaks i atleast drive down return it vs hassle shipping it .	1
nib this pen far too broad . most fountain pen manufacturers would probably rate it " medium " . it write nice , smooth line , it conveniently disposable , but it also looks very disposable . its appearance less elegant even than most rollerball pens . if you considering buying this pen because you like elegance fountain pens , or its " fine " point , then this not pen you . these both major considerations me , i quite disappointed	1
i've gone through three shredders but this one worst . it loud jams easily . others loud jammed too but this particular one lasted me only three months . when it jammed , power automatically shutdown . i kept it reverse waited power come back one two hours later . i'm kinda ruthless shredders , sticking papers staplers , tape or dried glue , i'm pretty impressed other shredders lasted so long . not this one , it came planet pms work only when it mood . i kept baskets placed one each room . looking one i bought before this one . least it lasted almost four years . wish me luck	-1
i would not recommend this product . when i plugged it , it would not stop chirping . directions said it might chirp " few times " while powering up , but thing chirped all day . also , 9 volt battery came product not fit into battery compartment . company i bought it told me just throw it away , although i receive full refund .	-1

these journals five , or three ? these journals truly something special . nice , firm cover ; lots pages ; pocket ; elastic keep them shut , they offer ton function compulsive scribblers . but ... they demand little flexibility journalist return . they don't handle all inks well , particular they handle very few fountain pen inks without significant bleed-through . so if one commits moleskine journal , one commits pen/ink combination won't bleed -- opening up both sides paper -- or one resigns oneself wasting back half each page . those willing little research , though , pen/ink combinations out there ( fountain pen users should look up noodler black ; gel roller users , pilot g2 refills also work splendidly moleskine ) . if you want solid , utilitarian journal , it tough beat these , especially reasonable price -- but bleeding pages require adjustments . it up you	1

i first encountered moleskine notebooks bookstore london this spring , what lodged my memory their marketing claim " legendary notebook hemingway , " et cetera . i since learned various sources those claims may touch exaggerated . but now i own one myself am starting make daily use it , i'm beginning see , least , why moleskine notebooks so many fans . more than ten years , i've used calendar/day planner/all-your-information-in-one-place system isn't just notebook but entire philosophy how you're supposed live your life tied into it . i never bought into aspect company , but grown used one reference containing all stuff two covers , place pen besides . going moleskine , its one small pocket back no place put writing instrument , definitely switch . it part change i'm least sure . other hand , moleskine definitely wins portability , ease use , style , handiness-to-have-around case brainstorms . so i'm still not completely sold this best all possible notebooks . but it definitely good one , i appreciate both attractiveness design quality construction . sure , you get serviceable notebook tenth price , whole " lifestyle system , " updated annually , quite bit more . it all matter taste , my taste starting run this direction	1
i beat hell out everything i own . my pda which this partially replaced aluminum hardshell case metal body . i broken just every watch i ever owned ( i have/had few excellent watches ) . i am naturally hard things due my focus life not my gear . this little notebook kept itself together so far , while looking very hip . i am software engineer/project manager am cognisant my technological options , this just faster , lighter thinner than my pda scribbling notes . i am never without it office . back folio pocket elastic strap looked dumb when i first bought it . however , i use folio pocket receipts reimmbursed ( better than leaving them pocket washed or thrown out)and elastic strap serves double duty second bookmark keep notebook together ( keeping it closed helps it survive ) . i like construction archival quality book . my notes look more like those disorganized madman than manager ( i am starting wonder if they synonomous ) but if i ever refer back them i assured they there long time . it only received 4 stars because they [ ... ] piece my current scrawling rate , i probably need 4 or 5 year . just get your company pay it if you , because they notebooks you rely there long while . lastly : person who likes their montblanc notebook tear out pages , they partially missing point . these books archiving keeping records ( questionable usefulness my case ) not making quick throw away notes . i also highly doubt their notebook thin one these either . each their own place	1
i've trouble finding avery 3297 dark t-shirt transfers any local store . some peculiar reason staples office depot carry many packets light fabric transfers , which worthless ( they fall apart after slightest use colors run when washed ) , but never more than 3 or 4 really terrific dark fabric transfers . i can't give enough praise these heavier plastic , opaque transfers dark colors , use them regardless color fabric . military veteran political activist , i use them peace rallies marches , made flags , banners , shoulder cap patches -- even occasional t-shirt ! highly recommend them , but where they stores ? some managers tell me they cleaned out during christmas season , i now suspect recent store stock bought up other political activists getting reading our rally march washington dc jan 27 . if you're activist , think how you use them . ps : i always hand-wash all my finished products cool or lukewarm water , no problems colors running . just sure design thoroughly ironed !	1

i tried lots other brands . store brands generally cheaper daily printing needs . compared others ( staples , office max etc ) i think office depot 24lb white printing paper better both terms quality price . i buy these print stuff myself , maps , emails etc ., they work fine . but if you want print something business purposes , submit or give someone else , job applications , you wouldn't want this one . you need something least 28 lbs case . but using heavy paper daily printing not really environmental friendly . that why i prefer light weight ones . i tried 20lbs too , but really believe me , if you injet printer , you wouldn't want print 20 lb paper . that why 24lbs optimum , least me	1

i went looking through amazon replacement chair my computer desk . old chair refurbished myself purchased second-hand market . it beautiful , but after couple years wear hours sitting computer , my neck killing me ! keep mind i relatively physical job lifting baggage 12 hours+ airport , so my body aching when i get home . i needed comfortable chair high-back rest my weary neck . i read some reviews other chairs say they easy assemble actuality not . ( keep me , i'm going sum-up raving review ! )i looked few chairs massage features - vibrate knead embedded rolling balls . well , i tried one those chairs . features great , but chairs ultimately uncomfortable . ( here it comes , i'm going tie this all together . ) not this chair ! it most comfortable chair i ever sat ! i wasn't sure what i getting looking picture , so i went office max . all their chairs sucked ! i went office depot fell love ! i sleep this chair ! i put my head back play computer heating pad my neck . it roomy oh sooooo comfortable ! words cannot express how much i love this chair ! when i took it out box , i thought , " this going so hard put together air lift wont work ; it probably wont feel same way it store .

just few months ago , i hadn't ever heard moleskine , let alone know global fan culture exists these little notebooks . when i first saw them display business bookstore london , i taken their design functionality much evocative marketing . now , nine weeks later , i've bought my third moleskine , this small squared " reporter " notebook . i know some people take their moleskines deep into jungle , exotic global treks , or journey them very heights imagination or contemplation . spirit , i take this notebook harshest environment i regularly encounter : gymnasium . my previous gym notepad eventually ended up looking pretty thrashed . i'm confident moleskine fare better , both because it smaller because fairly sturdy cover . if i one complaint , though , it cover . it doesn't flip fully over back , way cover spiral-bound notebook , so when you're reading or writing it , top sort flops around . ( maybe top * * flip over , i just haven't brought myself brualize notebook much yet . but it not obvious it designed so . ) still , it solid , attractive , functional , easily portable notebook . utilitarian environment like gym , that very good set characteristics	1

prismacolor pencils well-known their range rich colors vibrant laydown , setting them apart any other type colored pencil . i've tried them myself i agree . lead wonderfully soft , therefore makes blending colors pushing them into one ease . downside lead little too soft , makes it harder get colors smooth ( it easier crayola because crayola harder lead ) . it , however , these great pencils especially go well prismacolor markers . :	1

this tray awesome storing wrapped dimes . hard plastic color coded green	1
i bought this light table my own use very happy size ease use . light bright . i highly recommend it artwork or aligning	1
i am particular paper cutters/ trimmers . i used many over years . this like traditional guillotine cutter but laser light guide you where you should cutting paper or photo . this gives very clean cut . no burred edges , no paper getting caught , straight line exactly where you want it . i not recommend small personal paper cutters fixed blades push/pull . i also don't recommend rotary blade cutters . both these type cutters get blunt quickly quite frustrating . they also difficult line up exactly where you want cut . they purport cut through few layers paper , but this simply not case . i find it difficult even using one page these cutters . after not very much use - such one or two batches whole page photos , they quickly give you burred edges blades need replacing often . they tell you grips large easy use , which definitely not case . i find grip this particular trimmer much more comfortable user-friendly . i also really love laser guidance . i highly recommend this product any person uses it home office or personal use .	1
this my 3rd this type mop . i only replace them because eventually something rusts out , so i recommend getting maybe one replacement mop head . what i like best it dries minutes since it basically soaks all water back up . i won't use any other kind after this am reminded how dismal other mops when i visiting others . we fake hardwood floors , terrazzo , ceramic tile it great all them . one improvement i would like see wider mop head so i cover more area faster . buy this mop ! this seller order time ship receipt 7 days fl .	1
i loved this so much i am buying one each several friends . it beautifully made , functional , works perfectly . thank you so much offering this , amazon . thank you woodform making them !	1
this sharpener only one i use my colored pencils- i've tried them all , i think . it only one put short point them , i realize this review similar one above . what i don't understand how everyone else above seems getting such long wear out them , because i go through one these every 3 months or so , just time warranty wears out ( how strange ) . if anyone better sharpener puts same short-angle point these pencils , but last longer than three months , i would love know it , especially since staples no longer carries it my area .	1
i am college mathematics student thus i find myself writing lot . i write notes class , recopy them , write down proofs over over , well write out lot homework . student means i'm also budget ! thus , nice , inexpensive pen key my success . i love fountain pens over ball point pens because you don't press so hard write . pressing hard so long turns writing into painful task . this particular pen actually designed comfort i no problem writing it hours end . it slightly triangular grip which makes it easy hold , it also very light . strong clip its cap such pen never rolls off any desk . nibs or tips these pens very strong take lot abuse . they same fine craftmanship more expensive lamy pens , but , body made plastic makes these pens very affordable . i am no expert plastics but one this pen made very high quality strong . i don't imagine body this pen would break even if you drove over it car . adding inexpensiveness these pens , converter cartridge , they also refillable . you buy this cartridge separately , but it only few dollars , available wherever pens sold . extra fine nib , one bottle ink easily lasts me year i drain normal pen day or two . clear plastic converter cartridge one which you twist order refill it . i like cartridge much better than more traditional squeeze fill ink bladders which messier you can't see how much ink actually them . this pen particular interesting look . it see through , which fun look but also helpful because i see how much ink i left know if i need refill it before class . decent single use pen cost you 5 dollars easily . initial price this pen more but it last you forever well spoil you writing quality far above decent 5 dollar single use pen . fountain pens general timeless style this one especially good looking . it designed comfort most all , its really cheap	1

never assume colored pencils children . never assume cheap art item poor quality art item . crayola , me , best known most afforadable widely ranged set pencils market . they hard lead gives very smooth laydown . these pencils , it always best start out light layer your colors until you get sleek , natural result . problem crayola lead too hard blending , i.e , ' pushing ' colors into one . if you type artist who into such things , i suggest prismacolor pencils . but you mix little white crayola pencil , so give it try if you like . overall , wonderful hardcore traditional artists or beginning scribblers . it definately won't burn hole your pocket .	1
i use fountain pen gel-ink pens everyday make notes , complete forms write cheques . left-handed i also dislike handwriting . i two expensive traditional fountain pens - rotring parker - well varsity . varsity good others . rotring heavy , cap doesn't fit properly any more nibs alone $60 each . parker , left-handed italic nib , good but parker ink awful - ' black ' merely dark grey . varsity black ink intense black - almost black pelikan fount india - dries quickly . it writes smoothly ( if little noisily ) . if you hate ballpoints ( i ) but like gel-ink fountain pens , this great alternative - effective inexpensive	1
fiskars knack not only sharpening their blades , but affixing both pieces scissors way they don't wobble or cut poorly . whether you buy them new or use them years , these babies right mark . they cut crisp , clean line through paper used fabric , hair or just anything else needs cutting . if you cut hair and/or fabric , however , it good idea different pair each thing you're cutting . scissors dedicated cutting fabric won't always well paper or hair vice versa	1
this item really great people arthritis or metacarpal problems . one disadvantage : one sliding arms broke when dropped . still , i'll order replacement it really helped my hands .	1
i highly recommned this jewelry cleaner anyone . it great investment something last last . it safe everyday use much more effective than those amonia cleaners . i just got mine couldn't happier . my diamonds shine just they when i got them jewelry store . it small light , great home use .	1
i've using this model pen over 15 years . i started using this pen when i military , where my job required me transcribe live , foreign language radio transmissions . my colleagues i tried many different brands models pens , me this pen offered best performance . when speed essential you learn write small extra fine point perfect . over years i've noticed some problems this pen , but nothing bad enough make me choose pen . after beginning use new pen , if you leave it tip up long time ( several months ) it stops working . also , it necessary use lighter touch this pen . if you press too hard tip bend if it bends too much pen useless , so using this pen rough environment , i.e. trying write while vehicle driving off-road , not recommended . i still keep my eye out try new pens every so often , but i keep coming back pilot precise v5 extra fine point	1
next time you find yourself classroom , check out teacher pen . whether used grade kindergarten handwriting or comment english 101 compositions , pilot precise v5 ( especially color blue ) seems first choice teachers everywhere . rollerball pens clearly more expensive than commonplace ballpoint models , but justify their cost . despite their similar name , ballpoints lack fluid line , precise control quality ink found rollerballs . i make cheap ballpoints take notes medical school patient records hospital ( my handwriting deserves no better ) , but my wife , english major ( actually linguist ) , accept no substitutes . joyanna loves bright , classy blue these pens way she control thickness line lightest touch . pilot apparently makes use proprietary ink control system ; it makes up funny stack baffles first part shaft behind tip . fine , pointed tip , it makes lines even thickness color only light touch ( it hard get used pen-mashers like me ) . clear plastic ink-gage side useful . joyanna tried slightly cheaper pens , but 12-pack like this seems only option truly satisfactory . pilot v7 similar , but makes thick 0.5 mm line instead thin 0.3 mm line produced this model . cap precise v5 seals tightly strong metal clip . all standard rollerball pens , changes pressure airplanes dangerous . pilot tells you hold pen upright when removing cap low-pressure plane cabin , but joyanna still keeps her pens plastic bag when flying . i seen other pens made pilot other manufacturers claim safe planes , but you might well get cheap ballpoint put you carry-on .

i bought this pen myself , but ended up giving it my daughter who college student great writer . lifetime writing , since i got refillable cartridge too . world increasingly devoted emails ball points , worse still disposable fountain pens -- isn't sort contradiction ?? -- lamy offers affordable writing style great , i mean great , grip . i never knew it mattered so much until i held pen properly designed . i think i'll buy myself , irresistible .	1

nutshell : standard size - well-made - easy use - comes good boxthese envelopes little bit pricey , but they accomplish what one needs #10 security envelope ; 1]- they made relatively heavy paper reinforced where something like check might within envelope . 2]- they self-seal , which me very big deal , i usually either get them too wet or i cut myself , if i seal them myself . 3]- they come nice box , which i usually give one my kids when its empty . it keeps them thinking re-cycling . 4]- i pick them up office depot avoid shipping this item . bottom line : real no-brainer -- just can't go wrong here ! excellent product it very easy take granted	1
i bought small one these blank , unlined pages pocket sketchbook . pocket sketchbooks commonly sold art supply stores one two varieties , either wire-bound or stitched . thing , wire-bound notebooks uncomfortable back pocket ( i just don't like feel , bumping up against ridges wires edge ) , most stitched bindings don't fold well moleskine ( folding nice wide so there plenty blank page use ) . honest , i may've fallen just little pompous tripe sketchbook great artists . thing , paper terrible . all ' bloggers geeks i've heard raving these notebooks use them their laundry lists or their ideas write or god knows what . while i'm not best artist around , i minor fine arts school , so i'm not completely clueless . so take my word ( or don't; it your loss ); paper just plain bad . most drawing paper some degree " tooth " -- roughness paper , which rubs off your graphite or charcoal smoothly onto page . tooth these sketchbooks nonexistent . rather than describe more detail paper , however , i believe i give apt description two words . manila folder . that what paper these books like , so nearly indistinguishable ( slightly smoother , fact , than manila folders -- even less tooth ) . while paper quality something personal preference , i've never seen anyone use any paper remotely similar this drawing , so i question claim these pads identical those used picasso et al . positive note , binding great , covers great , elastic strap , bookmark ribbon , back pocket all great features . but when it comes down it , i care most paper quality . if you want just write , get one these . if you intend any serious drawing , don't bother .	-1

okay , here deal . this thing built well , but it dimensions performance work against it . it height width just right pocket book , but it thickness gets it trouble . it clunker , if you put this thing your pocket ( if it fit ) you feel it . hell , it might even pull your pants down . thickness also makes it awkward write since it never folds flat there always resistance when jotting down idea , which makes writing chore ( which counter productive pocketbook ideal , which maximum convenience ) . if you looking real nice small notebook , opt moleskine . pass this clunker	-1

when i first purchased papermate phd multi , i thought , " wow ! " what awesome instrument . felt great hand i iove flow ink . very smooth . nice pencil stylus bonus ! " however , because i liked pen so much used it every chance i got , within 3 weeks , ink cartridge empty . that when my love pen began falter . i opened pen , according package instructions , removed ink cartridge . however , it never worked same again . twist click feature failed hold pen advanced position , so whenever i would bear down write , it would retract push up into pen again . so , i bought , thinking i must something wrong . carefully , after ink ran out 2 weeks this time ( guess i more writing ) , i changed cartridge again . same thing . high price tag ($8-9 ) plastic pen , i bought third gave it one more try . same luck . so , while i loved feel flow pen , it certainly not worth price tag pen whose mechanisms , housing construction only last month . won't buy one . three times you're out .	-1

this product worked ok 3 months then shredder began fall apart . there little finger like pieces ( breaking off ) underneath shredding area which began collect paper cause paper backup jammed shredding mechanism . more fingers fall off , faster paper backs up gets jammed . so after every 10-15 pages i get out pair needlenose pliers pull impacted paper out these tiny slots . it takes 10 minutes extreme frustration unclog this clunker . that minute page . this obviously completely unacceptable because if i enough time spend 1 minute shred each piece paper i would paper mache artist . now , i just use it store paper until i buy new shredder . this product complete disappointment me	-1

first i thought it difficult justify added expense paper , but you get good quality . one reviewer comments stains ; but after buying using 5 or 6 different moleskines , i believe exception would replaced . i like reporter style writing quickly or limited space , but i like bookmark standard notebooks	1
this notebook fabulous ... its history inspires . i think it last type notebook i use my journaling writing . i adore it	1
i afficionado blank books since childhood , this one best . moleskine usually lasts me year -- that year grocery lists , ideas , business plans , sketches where furniture ought , phone numbers , recipes , all things i might written scraps paper lost if it weren't my moleskine . who needs blackberry ? this notebook sturdy , pages sewn ( rather than glued ) , so they don't fall out . paper good quality , pleasure write . there ribbon keep your place , elastic keep notebook shut while it bashing around your bag or pocket . there even clever little accordion-pleated pocket back receipts or ticket stubs or other small paper treasures . moleskines come lined blank well squared , but squared best my purposes -- you'll amazed how many uses you find graph paper once you it	1
without question greatest journal i've held , including those priced much higher . i travel lot , find notebooks hold-up all conditions . just owning it makes me want write	1
many us who searching great notebook years found moleskine best . number reviewers commented price too high . it worth price . after you buy moleskine you never buy brand . amazon great place purchase these books because they not found many stores . my favorite characteristic moleskine notebooks they stay flat no matter what page you . no matter what your profession , there notebook you . they music notebooks , storyboard notebooks , even japanese album notebooks photos	1
when i ordered this item , i kind skeptical how well it would really work . i purchased it impulse i trouble holding up my large psychology text book i took notes my laptop . i looked many items ended up choosing this one because ( 1 ) price ; ( 2 ) its versatility . when i finally got package , i doubted its performance even more because how light it , but , wouldn't you know it , it holds up my large text book no problem all -- thanks pop up tabs hold it place . good thing it light plastic it flexible , so all i need turn page pull back page tabs cross page over then it bends right back into place . i definitely recommend this item . [ ... ] .	1
anyone even remotely familiar moleskine books know they standard which others looked down upon . my only advice not buy them here unless you're not spending your own money--you'll pay same price any local stationer / hip-urban-gen-x shop , but won't get raked over shipping coals like i foolishly	1

while history cool , extent which everyone drinks kool-aid gobbles it up bit startling me . i suppose those people who still care enough physical writing experience pen paper might more inclined romanticize it ( other words , not only great notebooks , see below , but also smart marketing , more power them ) . i also enjoy writing , but respect little 3.5 " 5 " books , purely practical level , i like these simply because there very few notebooks out there provide such high quality writing experience such small volume space . little ( 3.5 " 5 " ) softcover almost ideal shoving your back pocket carrying everywhere , nice , high quality paper . covers durable smooth enough still work well even after acquiring some " character " your back pocket ( ie they actually mold your [ ... ] bit ! ) . i haven't tried fountain pen it ; although i enjoy writing them , i wouldn't use one this application anyway . these little books not really writing great american novel ( or great novel your country origin ) , they're more jotting notes or to-do lists , they work extremely well this role . only reason i withhold one star lack feature would make them completely perfect me ; pen attachment/enclosure provision . my ideal book would able accomodate thin pen spine , so book could slid into my pocket easily no fear snagging or worry whether i remembered " click " pen retract it . i realize this would make it bit bulkier , though . it , my leading pen choices this fisher space pen or zebra g-301 medium point gel retractable , former very , very short ( but bit thicker ) when capped , latter very nice skinny , but longer . anyway , these notebooks pleasure use , though bit costly , how long they last me pleasure ( utter utility ) i get using them , they seem like " reasonable extravagance " me . i'll go through many , many these before i spend what i would cheapest pda	1

" it personal preference , but i'd opt fine nib over medium if you're going use this everyday--you'll write faster use less ink . medium nice big john hancock-ish signatures weighty thoughts , but you lose little expression ( those personal shadings slight angles even untrained can't help but produce ) . steel nib writes surprisingly smoothly , mentioned above , ink doesn ; evaporate too quickly . you can't refill pen ( it disposable just because ) , but you buy several different colors nib sizes , get some idea what kind pen suits you . if when you feel like you want purchase re-fillable fountain pen , try something under $50 . levenger.com excellent " true writer " " retro " brand pens sell this much . although those liquidy smooth gel pens taken some over some non-ballpoint market , mechanically-minded enjoy physics bottle-filling pen ; others simpy dig tradition using pen rich history . when it comes fountain pens , " " panache .	1

i use fountain pens everyday , so i know what i am talking : this great fountain pen everyday writing -- one you not care gets lost or damaged due its very low price ( unlike average ( non limited edition ) fountain pens , which cost over $100 -- sometimes much more ) . pilot varsity pen lays down great fine-to-medium line ink , nib ( ie : writing tip ) not dry out too fast when left uncapped -- pen seems write forever its large internal ink reservoir . fantastic buy ; no muss-'n-fuss refill pen either ! [ one reviewers below stated these varsity pens not " real fountain pens " but " fact ballpoint pens " : this not true slightest , so i assume writer review must gotten his pens confused , since all pilot varsity pens absolutely true fountain pens .	1
