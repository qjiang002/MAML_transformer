this product so disappointing i discarded entire box after trying one bar . there much better raw food bars market terms both nutrition taste	-1
silly me ! i assumed these bars would taste like spirulina cashews , but only ingredient you taste them , or any their other " flavors " dates . if you really love dates , go it . otherwise , forget it	-1
flavor just passable . cracker too thick , not found topping soften it ..	-1
i really enjoy organic foods , so when i came upon this item i thrilled they making organic popcorn- especially newman own , brand i've liked past . i agree other poster , flavor bland almost flavorless . there other brands organic popcorn i've found more recently far better . don't waste your money so many them !!	-1
purchased these my sons lunch box , can't it , they too salty . he always happy veggy booty , what he'll continue get	-1
only recieved one instead 12 boxes amazon not able fix- still waiting remainder orde	-1
because tummy troubles , my doctor ordered me very bland diet . well this stuff just what doctor ordered , it almost completely tasteless . i can't give it one star which qualifies hating it , i can't hate anything pasta one ingredients , but it not good . it makes kraft mac cheese seem very exciting ! i would not reorder would fear ordering anything else annie . this would only young children who hate anything taste it	-1
most strip either hard brittle or so tough they could barely chewed . they put no expiration date bags so i don't even know if i given old product or they allowed salmon leave processing plant this way . top this , they too spicy . my dog seemed enjoy it though . ahi tuna , other hand , great	-1
i very disappointed taste this item . not all what i expected splenda . it much too overpowering , strong when added your beverage , all you taste . instance , if added coffee , you not detect any coffee flavor , only splenda flavor . much too strong . i prefer subtle taste other coffee additives over this splenda product - without question !	-1
... who said texture this product somewhat strange . i love beef jerky , especially peppered hot spicy varieties . but this jerky lacks chewy-ness i expect quality beef jerky . this stuff kind breaks down little too easily takes mushy , grainy consistency . flavor isn't bad , but after reluctantly finishing first bag , i can't bring myself open second one . perhaps i wasn't paying proper attention , but i somewhat surprised learn this product originated brazil . i would not purchased it if i known this	-1
i picked up bag these my local health food store few months ago after hearing pirate booty great product . these tasted rather odd me i wound up getting rid bag quickly possible . puffed corn chocolate type taste just don't go well together my opinion . it might ok if cocoa all you could taste , but not case here	-1
i am really disappointed this beand they marketing this kids . 4% iron no other vitamins ?? childhood obesity epidemic proportions , why would anyone feed their children all these empty calories ?? it like giving them coke or pepsi breakfast !! ok organic coke but still coke !! i am sad because i heard great things this brand really like what they doing endangered species !! but they not thinking their target consumer children	-1
cautioned when ordering this product . what happened i ordered this product month ago , sent flatbread version instead clear tub bite-size version . i called amazon , explained my problem , they promised fix it sending me replacement . well , replacement came last week , it still flatbread . i'm not going bother call amazon again because i know it just result them sending me flatbread once again . flatbread itself tasty crunchy . i think seeds really helped put more complexity into flavor . you eat just flatbread snacks or maybe put bit peanut butter or jam top . it tastes very different than wheat , i like taste spelt quite bit . so please prepared receive flatbread version when you order . you may well just order flatbread version start save yourself couple bucks well call amazon straighten things out	-1
i trouble getting cups function properly without getting grounds my coffee . first i thought it my coffee maker but other brand coffee i use worked fine . sometimes it took 3-4 cup changes finally find cup would work correctly without getting grounds my coffee . most time i would just give up . again , other brand coffee i use never this . not getting this coffee anymore - i would comment taste , but i never got really taste it grounds all . donna - marylan	-1
after extensive research grains nutrition , our family added amaranth our staple diet . there not wide range suppliers amaranth we started purchasing bob red mill amaranth . well , honest , our experience this product it pretty poor quality . out 8 packages we've bought so far , we've return 3 outlet we purchased them due amaranth mouldy . i mean " open package you smell it off right away " mouldy . addition , one packages didn't smell mouldy but after we'd cooked it added it baby food we making , mouldy smell cooked amaranth very noticeable . not good , particularly we're using amaranth making baby food our toddler mouldy grain not really something you want include ankle-biter diet . addition , we found we hand pick stones , grit dirt each package very very carefully . seems they included bonus . ( note grain itself very small , stones , dirt grit very small too - but big enough damage teeth if they slip through cleaning process - particularly toddler teeth ) . this cleaning sorting process involves lot work , which we wouldn't mind so much if amaranth consistently good quality , but it hasn't . i say while , after our research , we'd recommend inclusion amaranth anyone diet , bob red mill amaranth grain not product we would recommend . if you no choice but this , very careful cleaning it hand picking stone , dirt grit out before you use it , make sure you check very carefully evidence mould both before after cooking . addition , i'd recommend checking retailer they refund you purchase price if product you bought off . so far , we've sucessful getting our money refunded ( when we receipt - we didn't once we didn't get money back time , but first time after we poorer but wiser ....	-1
this coffee doesn't anything special it . i like good kona coffee i think 2 stars really tells it all	-1
first all , tea chest disappointing say least . chest made cheep compressed sawdust then coated plastic like ' finish ' which makes box look like it constructed cardboard plastic . tea its self alright , sadly nothing special . this item arrived good 6 weeks after it ordered , all tea packets wrinkled crushed box broke after i opened it few dozen times . needles say , this product way disappointing all around .	-1
this coffee off , sour taste . it almost if it " went bad , " milk that past date . i only made one cup before throwing out rest bag . i certainly won't ordering this brand again	-1
i tried this once . you get same thing buying some popping corn your local grocery , popping it , pouring it into bowl , adding milk . this made me reluctant try other kashi products . frankly , i don't see why people continue pay outrageous price what amounts popcorn . ps . amazon should add zero star rating	-1
really dry just not good could . disappointment after using this companys other products	-1
we buying melita buzzworthy dark roast pods over two years quite satisfied . recently , they increased diameter pods enable them fit other machines . i also understand thet they increased diameter pod holder new machines they selling . time melita made these changes , i believe they also reduced quality coffee their new pods because it just not taste nearly good . accordingly , i rated old pods 4 stars but new pods deserve only 2 stars . we now sampling pods other companies find good dark roast coffee	-1
date bottom shows expiration june 2007 . i would expect longer shelf life . also label shows mechanically extracted chicken meat . this generally equates bone fragments . i'm not confident this product	-1
" highest quality , wholesome ingredients " my aunt ida . seriously . how companies get away this nonsense ??? first ingredient corn syrup , followed closely sugar .

i bought this before snack store i love combination beef white cheddar . i figure i would try buy it bulk instead paying $2 pack store . however , i'm not sure if it stored too long warehouse or if it too hot warehouse , but cheese disgusting ! it dry crumbly this awful taste . i even opened second third pack see if it fluke , but all packages like this . beef stick good , however , if i order again , i'd order product without cheese . it just not fresh . ( yes , i check expiration date it wasn't expired	-1
anyone who really loves gourmet cup coffee hate this ! it burnt , bitter , weak , battery-acid ! , consequence , those coffee lovers may begin hate their new senseo -- but take heart ! many online coffee shops now offer decent delectable coffees prices rival this cheap swill . i don't specifically want endorse any one product or online retailer but google search " senseo compatible pods " you'll find several first page . also , please note while these may initially seem pricier , most third party pods work just one make 8-ounce cup instead two pods senseo brand products demand . you math it works out comparable costing cup joe .

i purchased these other day . i received them 11th jan 2007i ordered some other ones before , 100ct box slim jims which very good but unfortunately , they kept revising my order dec 19th until jan 10th so , i canceled order because it taking way too long . i thought these would just good . ($15 dollars more than 100ct box , but just good there 180 them , instead 100 ) . wrong ! these really bad . they all dried out hard rocks , top it off , they expire 24th feb . less then month now . i've never this problem amazon before . usually their stuff fresh . you not able return them either . once they opened you stuck them . i contacted amazon this problem they gave me little my money back . i not buying these future . amazon must these quite some time them so bad .	-1

" no sweeteners " , yet first ingredient listed after carbonated water " white grape juice concentrate " , which might not sucrose , but since when not sugar ? each small ( 8.4 oz ) 170 calories 41 carbs . i so excited find healthy fun drink , but this not it flavor ? lot like mountain dew . mostly sugar , yes there some lemon it , but it hard tell it meyer lemon opposed some other type . example food manufacturers slipping very unhealthy drink into market " 100% juice , no preservatives , no sweeteners , all natural " -- better they should say " drink this make sure you get fat type 2 diabetes !!!	-1
great looking beans . unfortunately , packages also full drug store beetles , common pantry pest . i could see them soon i opened box . why they not catch this bob red mill	-1
i thought this would full dried fruits nuts ( other words , healthful ) but it really just sugar laddened bits hard fruits only flavorless peanut pieces . i given local food bank all but one package i opened which made me feel so unwell it now rubbish . i am truly very disappointed this product . it description belies it reality . if sugar contraindicated your diet .... steer clear this product !! it low salt low fat but so over sugared actually nauseating . it too bad because it sounded delicious so nutritious . all i say yuk !!! i suggest you leave this product alone unless you think high sugar good you	-1
i hardly eat this all salt , it leaves you thirsty it so bad . ingredients list reads , literally , " 100% organic sweet corn , sea salt , nothing else " . they need make it " 100% organic sweet corn nothing else " , they'd probably something really great . it i'm stuck 23 1/2 bags salty corn i'll give away	-1
i beat this mix longer than 10 minutes suggested , it still too runny even stay my angelfood cake pan . it baked flat disgusting rubbery texture , completely inedible . when i very nicely wrote my concerns request product refund , customer service person said they could not give me refund , said " thank you your understanding " -- huh ?? i'll never purchase any more their products	-1

i got this gift person who appreciates fine teas , this undrinkable . fact , it unsmellable . i opened tin , smell overpowering clearly not natural . smelled tasted like handcream . yes , i actually tasted it . furthermore , tea practically powder teabags cheesy - quality you'd find no-name tea dollar store . tab simply said ceylon tea . it looks like " bentley " got stuck load crappy teabag seconds , sprayed them jasmine perfume stuck them fancy tin . i gave it one star tin . if you even tiniest discrimination when it comes tea , don't buy this one	-1
i never eaten these , because well , they're not vegan . they amazon vegan section however . whey not vegan it very first ingredient	-1
first , quality tomato products should never packed plastic . high acidity may cause plastic leech into food . then , these pooly packed amazon , 2 orders -- both arrived cracked open amazon just throws them box , so they crack make nasty mess . sauce , well it tastes fine , but i think it not well balanced , very acidic , we feel horrible after eating it hours . simple good ingredients , so i'm not sure what it making us feel sick	-1
while flavor unique , three five packets nuts rancid ! say i am disappointed understatement . unfortunately , this not first time i problems freshness food products purchased amazon . now , one two non-rancid packets . i got through one few days , i working other ... them i realized i major head-fog , you know , like hangover , but without anything drink . i gave up nuts it went away . me , that tell-tale sign additives food . not good choice someone chemical sensitivities . i purchased this sd recommendation . but it complete utter waste money me .	-1
got deal machine , love concept . but every senseo coffee i tasted absolutely horrible . i've tried 4 oz one pod- way too bitter so 8 oz 1 pod ... still most awful coffee i've ever . normally i drink gevalia , but i use folgers sometimes or millstone ... i don't think i could drink this stuff regular basis if someone paid me . all purchases i've made amazon , this first time i've ever felt compelled give feedback . itself speaks volumes	-1
i second other reviewer comments partially hydrogenated oil kellog using kid cereal !?!? it year 2006 , time start making these cereals healthy without trans-fat ridden cheap oils !!!!	-1
sell date package less than month . so they would not go bad , i felt like i needed personally eat more than i would . i retail store i need bit more time new products . this costly mistake . also , " wholesale price " business itself same amazon price except amazon gave free shipping discount coupon worth ten bucks ! cool deal beans amazon ! retailer , i would think i would able get better deal betty lou or get reasonable sell date . very tasty addicting	-1

i tried really hard like this stuff . you know , organic all . elbow macaroni fine but sauce gummy , pasty tastes like cheez-whiz . if you like cheez-whiz , you love this mac cheez . if not , pass it . i'd given it mikey but he doesn't live our house anymore . my recommendation make your own scratch . it not difficult it so much better .	-1
this type mac cheese pasta doesn't produce much elbow mac cheese . other than , it tastes same . good stuff	-1
tastes just like regular skippy i.e. unnatural texture because it contains palm oil	-1
i ordered loose tea tins received 6 boxes tea bags . only labeling box barcode sticker tea tins , which incorrect . when calling customer service i only two options -- return tea bags or keep them overcharged . there no follow up , so there no way know if i would receive correct product if i ordered again . price gone up 20% mean time . rather than without tea ( i can't buy brand where i live ) , i kept it . you can't get your money back if you over charged , you can't complain it anyone who cares . i never use amazon grocery again if i help it , i suggest you same .	-1
this bar would great if it wasn't so full sugar . it gives me sugar headache .	-1
" without any sulfites , preservatives , hydrogenated oils , artificial colors or flavors . " ... but not without great deal sugar high-fructose corn sweetener . like previous reviewer i bought these costco . brought them back due sickly-sweet taste . there so much added sugar it getting little difficult taste berries . if you prefer berries au naturel or just little extra sweetness , watch ingredient list these . sugar second ingredient weight - corn syrup fourth	-1
i didn't like them , too sweet sticky . my dog likes them , though . these just didn't it me .	-1
i so very disappointed this cereal . it taste very sweet . if you look ingredients , it filled sugar , corn syrup more sugar . i counted 12 ingredients really just forms sugar ! it also loaded salt . i would give this zero stars if i could , because it more sugar than most " sweet " cereals . why mislead public into thinking they making healthy choice when all you doing serving sugar new label adding little bit soy package ? absolutely ridiculous	-1
bought dozens different varieties these - all arrived way past expiration date terribly stale . don't chance it - i'm not only customer who this problems these products	-1
almonds slightly seasoned ' barbecue ' kind flavoring , which subtle but nice . cashews , other hand , hard believe . taste conjures up images me them stored semi-pervious containers paint-and-finishing room my high school industrial arts class . they really awful , any lover cashews appalled	-1

i love most jack links jerky products , however , i disappointed this product though it all heat - flavor lacking true pepper taste . it tasted like bunch powdered old hot spices not true fresh pepper cure . i think mistake most people make hot peppers not removing seeds before using , this give bitter well hot taste . i not given up jack links - just ordered their turkey jerky	-1
i thought these would slightly sour , like dried cherries i enjoyed past . no -- hfcs high fructose corn syrup -- so these taste strangely sweet , like weird raisins . they ok if i cook them oatmeal or if i'm really hungry , but i wouldn't buy them again . if you looking tart dried cherries look elsewhere	-1
i purchased two these packages mid jan 2007 . i only finished one box ( four ) am finding 1 out 4 packets caked . due apparently small air leak packet so moisture get ( only my personal theory ) . i just pound packet knife handle break it up use it anyway but it problem . they known it now long time , seems like they would solved problem ....	-1
i drink lavazza coffee nearly every morning local restuarant . when i saw this amazon , i assumed it would great -- but it isn't . even though this sold " drip grind coffee " , grind way too coarse drip coffee maker . result you need use nearly twice much coffee get decent cup . decent good it gets -- not great , not even very good -- just decent . illy ( admittedly much more expensive ) drip grind delivers much nicer , smoother cup using 1/2 much coffee -- so mabye it not all much more expensive long run .	-1
it arrived rancid mold all 4 jars ... not so great . i purchased there other products enjoyed but not this . pretty gross overall .	-1
my wife bought these me i just putting them my morning cheerios like madman i said , " hey , these good ... where you get ' em ? " " oh , amazon ... you believe they only $17.00 ? " silence . i just looked her , " you nuckin ' futs ? gimme those things . i'm going put them into our safety deposit box our bonds , our living trusts , my favorite hot wheels ... " blueberries good you i would suggest eat them regular basis , but price these things simply absurd . i look like i'm wearing my shirt says , " stupid " ? i don't think so . i'm sure you get frozen blueberries less hey , fresh always good , if you can't get frozen or fresh , get hostess blueberry pie . sure it sugary feel like you've got leadweight your stomach after eating it but pie only . 50 cents .. these little blue suckers $17.00 . that more than my whole wedding cost . just kidding . i'm not cheap . actually , i'm not cheap all , but i like money i refuse pay $17 some humiliated looking berries ... geesh	-1
wish i would paid attention this one , previous review . cost what you get outrageous . only reason i gave it one star because there no place give zero starts . don't waste your money like i !!! find more economical product ( plenty more choices amazon btw )	-1
i exact same experience " heather " shown below . they sent me less expensive non-organic version this product twice then informed me they couldn't guarantee when problem would fixed . remember strawberries cherries every list crops containing most pesticide . now add freeze dried snacks concentrated . finally , take these concentrated levels place them small child or toddler body their pesticide exosure goes through roof . math . note amazon : this great product fruit " nothing else " its ingredients . please retain it get it right benefit scores us enjoy providing healthy treats our kids .	-1
i don't recommend any baxter soups . these terrible . waste money . not buy again . amazon i'm beginning see why item sale , you want get rid them . zero stars	-1
it almost seems like i received different soup based other 5 star reviews . broth thin , mostly cubed potatoes very fishy smelling . don't get me wrong , it edible , but i won't ordering case this flavor . i'm still waiting receive mushroom blue cheese flavors	-1
these little mealy or grainy , but ok . pretty high carbs though	-1

my product should delivered month ago . this very bad buisness think you ship something whenever you feel like it . i am paying customer should reinbursed some way mistake your copany made .	-1
i trying these change pace turkey jerky i normally eat . they taste ok ( nothing special ) , but several medallions ( least 3 bags so far ) ' crunchy ' bits them . i suspect it gristle , or possibly small bone fragments . not pleasant eat . i may just gotten bad batch ( other than crunchy bits , i'd give these 4 star rating )	-1
i bought this just try something new . i love peach mango flavors , this sounded very good . i think it good drink , but whether or not i am able think better because it up debate . i doubt i'll buy these again if only because they quite pricey . 12 small cans ( liquid volume only smidgeon over one cup ) over twenty dollars ? it close enough $2 make it not cost effective get vitamins minerals this way . taste good , but i lots other healthy drinks taste just good less than third cost . but now i know , this drink not me . if you like good-tasting nutritious drinks cost lot money , this one you !	-1
these absolute worst crackers i ever tasted . if styrofoam could served box it would taste like these . save your money	-1

pro : no trans fat . con : no flavor . basically tastes like cardboard . my children won't eat it	-1
i gave it one star concept . i'm fan dave hot sauces . his combination smoky barbeque flavors straight heat always gets my saliva going . but this spray disappointing heat . fact , there nearly none i could even discern . it also poor flavor . it tastes like bad watery vinegar . so why buy stuff if it doesn't taste good or get your endorphins pumping ?? oleo-resin habaneros which supposed give spray heat like come out solution pool up top bottle . so instead homogeneous red color , you get blood red color floating top pale yellow color you shake furiously get spray looking normal again . i called dave it they told me that typical behavior ! i excited this sauce because i always wanted way evenly disperse sauce onto pizzas , but all i got over-priced spray bottles filled something i really can't describe edible . i'd fill it sauce but it'd probably just clog nozzle . it also intended use natural pest repellant . dave suggest spritzing some your garden keep rabbits bay . i've never tried so i wouldn't know if it works claimed . i hope it or there'd no need this product exist all	-1
this product came me packed bags , not cans . disappointed	-1
i am always looking quality nutricious treats my teens . i bought samplers see if anyone favorite . sorry say we just not like any these . little too spicy we looking crunch got chewy .	-1

i thought these gummi bears tasted funny , like there perfume them . i eaten other brands gummi bears ( or gummi bear wannabes ) , these not taste anything like those . flavors not very distinct or fruity . texture also very different not very palatable . i know these vegan gummi bears not contain gelatin , i assume why texture so different . however , i eaten brand ( sunny bears ) gelatin-free " gummi bears " , their texture very different , more like jelly candy . i would buy regular gummi bears , but i am allergic dyes i can't find any dye-free except these sunny bears . after i wrote amazon customer service product explained them i could not stand eat any more wanted return them , they immediately refunded my money - no questions asked - even though product not eligible return because it grocery item . i impressed	-1
" contains 50 percent more caffeine than other gourmet coffees " this because it not arabica beans , which beans quality coffee brewing . it rubusta , cheap mostly vietnamese " filler " coffee mostly found ihn supermarket blends such folgers , maxwell house , etc . flavor burnt twigs but you get more caffeine . that pretty much robusta . i guess it ok since most people who go into starbucks ask vanilla caramel almond suger drinks rather than caring coffee ... or it because they've never told there big flavor difference arabica robusta they incorrectly believe if they order without all suger flavoring they'd taste folgers ( or shock) ? if you like coffee - good coffee - stick arabicas . if you like good coffee flavor also lke more caffeine then just find lighter roast arabicas . if all you want caffeine you'll look smarter if you avoid markeing silliness shock buy nodoze .	-1
i love blueberries , both fresh dried , but these sugar added which makes them far too sweet my taste . dried fruit always naturally sweet , added sweeteners just turn them into pure candy , instead naturally healthy snack . thumbs down this one	-1
i've tried several brands gluten-free pizza crusts , i bought ener-g my latest product exploration . huge fan many ener-g products , i thought this one would slam dunk hit . how wrong i . ener-g pizza crusts too thin , dense , heavy , very little taste . you would think " thin " " heavy " would contradictory , but that what i really mean say . contrast , kinnikinnick pizza crusts light fluffy , such outstanding declicious flavor . i would strongly suggest buying single package ener-g pizza crusts your local health food store first . i made mistake trusting ener-g this product before i bought whole case it . it expensive lesson . but , nonetheless , huge thanks amazon offering so many gluten-free products . here us , we just starting become familiar how many people affected gluten	-1

if you dont like mangos , you not like this drink . it not taste like " organic " mango , but rather , it tastes more like " essence mango " you would smell air freshener . this mix pretty well cold rum . i would suggest you find this brand locally try it before you buy it . this water not taste like water you would get asian countries . i cant really explain why either	1
zico coconut water tastes natural it coconut . if you never coconut water before i would suggest drinking one before buying pack 12 . some people may say it aquire taste , but i think most importantly it all depends what culture you raised . i started drinking coconut water ever since i baby . it very healthy low sugar . currently i give it my [ ... ] son part his snack instead high sugar content orange juice or other juices	1

i tried lose weight long , o , time . also long , o time , i seen newpaper advertizements this tea . it seemed ridiculous me first .... i mean , lose weight drinking tea ? this idea just much credibility me some those sauna belts , ( which help you lose weight full 24 hours .... after which time it comes back again ! )well , last year i getting pretty desperate . i somehow managed lose 40 pounds .... drinking only regular tea , instant coffee , home-made lemonade , eating only bird eye vegetables turkey . ( fact , i invented " turkey diet " ! it very simple : eat turkey , fall asleep ( tryptophan ! ) ..... if you fall asleep , you can't eat , you see . variation , i guess , " hollywood diet " , which used only weekends .... because most people need stay awake during week go work ! ) anyway , this diet worked me .... but it pretty boring .... took most my free time away , .... turkey expernsive ! i gradually stopped this diet , gradually got back 20 those 40 pounds . i looked desperately way lose weight .... but drinking tea it just didn't logical .... however , no other method presented itself inexpensive drinking tea .... after all expensive ( but delicious ! ) , turkey , it seemd good way go . now , this particular tea itself quite expensive -- $43 4 ounces , ( sale .... ouch ! ) .... but 4 ounces lose tea would make least 60 6 ounce cups , ( 360 ounces ... i'd course adding my own water sweetener ) .... so i figured , why not ? ( well ... because possible bad taste , that why not . i've tried herbal teas past , -- delicious exception jasmine tea -- thoroughly disliked each one . ) but even so , i decided risk it ... i've tasted far worse things than herbal tea , after all .... so , year ago , i sent away it . when wu-long tea arrived , ( lovely little transparent green plastic bag , lined aluminum foil , giving impression crushed green diamond ) , i made it drank it . hmmm , ( or rather , " mmmm ! " ) not bad tasting all ! it tasted like best black tea ... kind , ( other than jasmine ) , i like best . but ,,,, tea so expensive , i decided not drink it too often .... owner " healthy refrigerator " , ( one loaded vitamins , which i take only emergencies , because i can't afford keep buying them ) , i now this " healthy tea " , which i put refrigerator keep it fresh ) , sort keep vitamins company ! i throughly read literature came tea , however .... noticed many people praised medicinal qualities this tea , it weight-loss abilities . hmmm .... i decided i happily gotten more than i bargained .... weight-loss tea one which helpoed other health problems . nice get such bargain -- but , $43 4 ounces lose tea , it still quite expensive . so , after first cup , i restrained myself drinking it , quite some time ..... actually , i didn't drink cup until two weeks ago ! i beginning feel if minor cut i gotten week before somehow let infection , ( though cut itself didn't look infected . ) anyway , i beginning feel very , very , very .... .... ... ..... two years ago , fact , i hospitalized infection .... very same infection killed my mother month before ! my mother , hospital , said she " felt like vegetable " , , gotten same infection , i knew how accurate description really : i so weak , then , fact , i trouble raising my arms above my head ! now i felt it starting happen again ! my first thought call 911 . but my second thought , strangely , concentrated those glowing testimonials i read other customers who used wu-long tea . i figured i'd try make myself cup .... if tea didn't work , i could always call 911 .... after all , though i felt very weak , i didn't feel totally paralzyed .... yet , anyway . but i knew i make drink tea fast ..... before total weakness engulfed me . i feel up doing so ? yes .... i ... took my time , i ... i very careful , ... i .. i stayed very near telephone i made tea .... just case .... i managed make myself cup tea .... wait it cool down bit .... drink it . within hour , feeling weakness left me ! , this writing .... taking place full two weeks later .... weakness , ( presumably infection ) , not come back ! (oh , if only i courage buy this tea .. o .. years ago , give it my wonderful mother !!!!!! )now , i'm not saying this tea work miracles everyone , every circumstance . tea not transform my looks those princess grace , ( whom i consider most beautiful woman all time ) , not cured me very slight case myasthenia gravis ... neuro-muscular ailment which i since age four . i doubt very much it made me immortal , i know fact it not granted me super-powers , or ability fly , or transcend time . ( no one ever accused me not good imagination ! : ) however , upon drinking tea , my feelings infection , ( feeling weakness quite different myasthenia gravis ) , go away ! i don't remember what other testimonals this tea .... but i'm sure , now , least 98% them true ! perhaps there no real " fountain youth " . but this tea ... which seems cure many ailments , most probably helps one lose weight well , if taken often enough , seems very close second . ponce de leon would happy it , i'm sure . i don't know if it help everyone ... but i know it helped me , ( probably other people who gave testimonials , too . ) second cup tea -- even whole 4 ounces lose tea -- certainly less expensive than going hospital ! those budget , like me , wu-long tea , it seems , destined used luxury , and/or emergency . but i really feel it belongs every home ..... just like aspirin . -- emergency use ... please take same precautions i : 1 ) sure you energy actually make drink tea , 2 ) near telephone , so you call 911 , case tea doesn't work you . tea work me , above circumstance , anyway . elixir life ? perhaps perhaps not , depending person circumstances . all i know , me , under circumstances described above , it certainly seems saved mine !	1

i originally bought these my kids but they didn't seem like it so i started eating them . they delicious only 70 calories bag . they make perfect snack it keeps me away cookies , candies other desserts . yes , they salted but nowhere near salty potato chips or cheetoes .	1
this some amazing sweet corn . it dried but also very light airy , it really taste like sweet corn great snack . why only 4 stars ? one they put salt it some reason , which really detracts overall taste - if they'd leave out salt maybe tell you add some taste ( neither us would add any , it doesn't need it ) , they'd real winner . second you buy case quantity , while it very tasty snack , it going take long time , waste lot cabinet space , get through 24 packs it - especialy salt content .	-1

i disagree person who gave this product only one star . i find i beat cake longer than box indicated needed bake it longer . i mixed my first one using my portable hand mixer which really too small this product . second time i used my new stand mixer whip attachment . it more than doubled volume after beating it 10 minutes longer than package suggested i beat it high . cake filled my tube pan top i baked it 5 minutes longer than package suggested my first one bit underbaked . my husband , who not celiac , loves this cake also . we can't tell difference this one regular angel food cake mix . i also used 1 teaspoon gf vanilla 1 teaspoon gf almond extract instead using 2 vanilla . i like almond flavoring angel food cake better , but personal preference .	1
tastes pretty good , but it still not starbucks . i like ordering this free shipping grocery coupon codes amazon runs occasionally . last time i got $10 off 2 cases . then its worth price . their chocolate espresso beans great	-1
i'll preface this stating i love hot foods i am not affected them , so i understand other reviews saying world kitches hot spicy too spicy . this not case me though . i found it perfect blend spicy sweet . i really enjoyed it ordered more . i got kick where i thought i would try all spicy jerkys amazon . i found this one i liked most , because bothe flavor fact there lot thin cuts meat , which made it easier eat . this kick , so if potential problem you may want go something milder . i say i even hotter , but if you enjoy some flavor your spice , you may want give this try	1

this tastes great , i love it my coffee , even used it pancakes . it really doesn't give me spike blood sugar , promised . only negative packaging they using . during shipping , some seals underneath lids came off , bottles leaked . i probably lost tablespoon ( each ) 3 6 bottles . lids don't really fit bottles , either . they pop-top , but if you use it , syrup sometimes leakes out under lid where it attaches bottle . if they could fix bottles , this would definitely five-star product .	-1
i enjoyed eating cerial . whether if it before school , work , or just snack . what i like this they come varieties ( frosted flakes , froot loops , cocoa puffs , etc . ) , so i won't eating same thing every time , which also good . if you're rush morning want something grab go within 15 minute period , i recommend this you . also you don't waiste your dishes , because they come their own plastic bowls . my only problem they so small , after 10 spoon fulls , it all gone . sometimes i'm still hungry after eating one packet ( i'm skinny too ) . true this contains trans fats , what breakfast item kids enjoy eating doesn't contain them ? not very many items . maybe eggs , whatnot . also if your kids somewhat active somekind fitness activities , those " deadly trans fats " should worked off end day . using fat free milk cerial would make situation better also	-1
i use this espresso regular coffee drip machine . it loaded flavor , full rich flavors , no bitterness . i purchased it twice , first five pound bag , then 4 one-pound bags . i think individual bags not only better value but they stay very fresh until you need them . i no trouble 5 pound though , it delicious first day last . i highly recommend this coffee	1

these slivered almonds excellent addition salads . i'm sure they good lots other things ( baking , stir fry ) , but they definitely make plain salads seem lot more gourmet . they're perfect size/shape/cut this purpose . shelf life also great . especially if you store them freezer or fridge you should good more than 6 months . bit pricey retail , but you can't beat amazon 6-pack discounted price . i'm stocking up	1
wow , we've never so much macaroni cheese long time ! annie really , really good . this doesn't need additional milk or butter , sauce easy-to-squeeze out paste foil package . it tastes great , makes great receptacle some creativity your own too . tips enjoy it : - just boil plenty water , six-cup requirement minimum . - drain quickly , put pasta back hot pot . remaining heat just right melt thick cheesy sauce into macaroni . don't rinse pasta cold water , it make it hard sauce combine well . - all deluxe versions animal rennet free . annie faq very specific which ones use vegetable rennet ( not all ) but amazon isn't picking up information . i tag really vegetarian ones " animal rennet-free " whenever i . - try blending sundried tomatoes , fresh tomato , olive oil , garlic , pizza peppers , salt , freshly ground pepper , touch balsamic vinegar into paste . this really complements mac cheese gives it new , gourmet taste still doesn't take away " mac cheesiness " it . - tabasco chipotle sauce makes great addition adventurous . smoky taste tempered creaminess	1
i just got case these - my 2 year old i just introduced ourselves ' fruit leathers ' , which we love . i figured i'd look this up it considerably less expensive per bar than buying 8-pack store . my daughter absolutely loves these so i ! we're planning bringing them treats when we go across street play kids who stay one my neighbors . my daughter even told me they're now her favorite treat . i feel fine knowing she getting something that really tasty sweet but it not gonna kill her too much sugar corn syrup	1
great product when you need just little extra stock/broth . it won't replace my use swanson because it would too much open 8 packages 2 quarts stock soup etc . but it great making pilaf etc . or when you're just little short quantity needed	-1

good cereal if you like something other than flakes . it doesn't get mushy like them . however , this product doesn't provide minimum vitamin content some other breakfast cereals , important consideration when one considers how vitamin deprived many us ( carbohydrate stuffed ) .	-1
upon arrival , i read nutrition info myself cereal box pleasantly surprised find they better than amazon listing . they 6 grams fiber ( balanced soluble insoluble fiber ) 1 ounce ( 28 gram =3 /4 cup ) serving only 5 grams sugars , all only 100 calories . all this isn't worth much though , if they don't taste good , right ? well , they good , very yummy , even out box . they rather like " life " cereal , regular flavor , just bit less stripped good stuff taste . whole grains really shine through they tend stay crispy milk much longer . i enjoyed bowl them topped just fine bit honey so flax seeds i topped them would stick not sink bottom , bowl plain milk , also bowl made into " muddy buddies " healthy version . i bought these initially make recipe " muddy buddies/puppy chow " recipe healthier ( using alternatively sweetened chocolate , freshly ground almond or peanut butters some date sugar toss after coating . these would also great alternative choice other " chex " cereal recipes . i like them so much , i give up my usual choices cereal provide same , or less , amount fiber twice calories also soak up too much milk bowl . give these try , they won't replace some worst offending sugar laden " kid " cereals no one noticing , but these really good choice tasty , always handy those " chex mix " recipes healthier spin . if sugar addict really needs more sweetening , just let them top these better choice sweetener your own choice , not giant company choice what makes them most profit . best all , we something affordable we like taste without supporting these huge companies ruining our health economy , well putting family farmers out business . i can't think any reasons why i wouldn't recommend these .	1

this product benefits organic whole grains environmentally responsible packaging , but it also my favorite cereal - flavorful super crunchy even if left milk while	1
these bars fairly good " healthy , " yet they lack flavor texture many other granola or fruit breakfast bars . me they taste like equivalent whole grain rice crispy treats ( if there such things ) added cranberries some ginger . combination cranberries ginger aid flavor , but bars " stickier " than i expected . all things considered , though , they seem healthy alternative more caloric bars	-1
we love peanut butter toast breakfast - but my husband would not eat anything but skippy , no matter how i pleaded . he not like natural peanut butter all . when i found this store i so happy - he loves it ! i too , it tastes great , like skippy but without all crap original . highly recommended	1

annie creamy deluxe shells real aged wisconsin cheddar made all vegetarian ingredients even organic pasta . sauce made cheddar cheese , cream , whey , dry milk , natural flavors annatto color . 12-ounce box enough two six people depending how hungry you time . we serve this side dish many meals normally get four six servings one box . when making pasta , use large stockpot filled halfway water because if you even use medium large saucepan , it might boil over . instructions say use medium saucepan , but i can't recommend personally it always boils over . once you pasta cooked , all you add packet creamy delish cheese sauce . this probably only box macaroni cheese information where get " green " bumper sticker . i also like cute " rabbit approval " sticker annie homegrown products . they all delicious ( not overly salted ) you feel good eating such healthy product . ~ rebecca review	1

this best breakfast cereal i ever found . low sugar content , whole wheat , yummy blueberries strawberries made it my favorite healthy breakfast snack food . now it disappeared store shelves it isn't available online either . kellogg website not list this product under list discontinued products . so why it not available ? my family used purchase 2-3 dozen these per month i know many other people bought this product . i find kids adults searching this product grocery stores looking dejected they helplessly purchase some other product instead . i hope kellogg notices there market this product	1

first , remember you'll getting lot cereal when you order this value pack - months worth if it just one or two people . fortunately , it doesn't too strong or strange flavor so you shouldn't get tired it . i suggest adding sliced banana or apple , or even shake honey-sweetened cereal it not most interesting cereal eat its own . my biggest recommendation - not eat it plain soy milk , grain flavors reinforce each other point bit nauseating	-1
this far best bagged popcorn i've ever eaten . smoked gouda flavor isn't really subtle , but who wants subtle snack like this ? it comes out whacks you head -- hey , i'm powdered gouda -- great , full-bodied flavor .	1

grape nuts trail mix crunch great . i remember regular grape nuts my mom , yuck ... she added almost much sugar there cereal make them taste good . but trail mix crunch different story - they great , nothing more needed . they added little honey , almonds raisins more flavor there 5g fiber per serving boot ! these also easier jaw than plain grape nuts , they not difficult chew , but still crunchy almost like granola . definitely family favorite ! i would say only downfall price ... they could bit less expensive , which true most granola-like cereals .	-1

i tried every goldenvalleynatural.com jerky product . far best all sweet n'spicy peppered flavors . beef tends smoky fatty , while turkey dry flaky , making their buffalo meat varieties best them all . avoid their low carb jerky unless you willing bite off tic-tac size bites chew minute each time . all teriyaki jerkys texture taste like sweet corned beef , so i'd skip them well . if you want try different flavors , instead 8 same amazon , just go directly their web sight buy them only 15% more than amazon sale price	1

this salmon jerky so unbelievably tough , it pretty much inedible . when you painstakingly gnaw it , it doesn't release much flavor , but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks your mouth . i misfortune ordering this , 7 8 bags still untouched , i'm not sure what them . i even tried soaking jerky , tried boiling it some macaroni , nothing seems soften this stuff up ! what waste money . go some beef jerky instead , if you need salmon , eat it fresh or canned . this product joke	-1
we've enjoyed these cookies months they available purchase our local costco warehouse . just purchased them bulk here amazon terribly disappointed find they arrived hard rocks stuck together . they don't expire until july , 2007 , so we're guessing something happened them storage ? we opened several packages they're all same . reason i am even taking time write this review say amazon online policy states grocery gourmet foods not returnable . you kidding ? i case $30 cookies simply not fit prime time snacking . i've e-mailed customer service regarding my delivery . it doubtful i'll order grocery items again i assumed return policy defective goods would same . just not worth hassle . update : amazon shipped us replacement order . unfortunately , again , all twelve packages hard . each package three rows cookies , each row stuck together each cookie must pried next . actually , it mute point doing this cookies simply inedible they hard , hard , hard . date package : 11 jul 07 , i suggest problem exists this batch , either storage or manufacturer .	-1

great idea poorly executed extremely unappetizing presentation . this someone who makes flavored rice few times week . said , this worst review i ever given anywhere , so bear me . you know how sometimes rice sticks bottom pan if you overcook you boil it out it turns oddly clear but covered carbon water ? yeah . like . rice came out sticky ( not it palatable uniform japanese steamed rice way ) almost alien kind translucent brown nothing like picture . nothing . if you look closely , you might able tell it once rice . yes , i followed instructions . my husband , who wanted try fresh rice work , described it abomination , which relief me because when it cooking it stenched up house horrifying yet familiar odor when i put my finger it smelled exactly , exactly , like onondaga lake syracuse ny summer back when it most polluted lake world people warned never eat fish they caught ( assuming there any alive there ) kids weren't allowed wade it . it smells like raw sewage , dead fish , rotting feathers chicken soup . it 45f out i opened window . sometimes you buy case something it turns out something you don't care , maybe it too much onion or whatever , but you know someone else like it . normally i donate these things needy family . i think this case it would cruel . i can't imagine anyone who made rice their own mistaking this rice . yourself favor just drop boullion cube pot your stovetop rice . that what they're trying here failing miserably . i can't sell rest auction site because i'm afraid even if i am completely honest smell i get bad rating . only thing i think use them smoke out people breakroom odor next april fool day	-1

we huge scone lovers absolutely disappointed taste these scones . mix easy enough assemble bake but scones decidely odd smell very caustic after-taste . my husband , who eat just anything , threw whole batch trash after trying his first one . we high hopes , but sadly , this product just didn't deliver	-1
when i think " dark roast " i think full bodied dark . melitta pods worst i've tried . i've tried senseo pods too which only mediocre . i find target brand " archer farms " pods best . french roast really rival starbucks home brewed . its cheap too ... 3.99 18 pods . if you like full bodied , rich , dark strong cup cofee , don't melitta . i found senseo archer farms pods fit my melitta pod brewer just fine	-1

i disappointed this product . we always enjoyed annie products never problem , until now .

i really excited ordering this set thrilled when it came . i noticed something unexpected teas , however . teas i tried this set i noticed unpleasant dry aftertaste . taster noticed same thing without my mentioning it . i really like glass tea pot . it very nice watch tea fill glass orb color flavor . whether flowers beautiful or look more like sea urchins matter personal taste . i high hopes starlight rose tea ( white tea leaves rosebud ) found it far inferior rose petal black blended tea republic tea , which excellent . other hand , numi moroccan mint one finest teas i ever tasted , superior old favorite mine- stash tea moroccan mint . after tasting this tea i am surprised number reviews rating tea comes set quite good . maybe i got bad batch or strange taste buds- but there it . bamboo box quite charming	-1
i bought whole box these , they tasted really rancid . they several months their expiration date , so wasn't problem . maybe i just got bad batch , but i'd unlikely ever try them again	-1
when you dirt your food you wonder what you really eating . otherwise flavor wasn't bad . i just can't eat dirt . it bad teeth	-1
i love flavor this sauce but it rarely arrives undamaged . packaging needs contain little tlc , then it would 5 stars . don't order if you need this certain dinner , it may not arrive usable	-1
but i may never know . i ordered this item october 27 . when shipment finally arrived , there only one container this inside ! i ordered four pack i'm sure . so amazon offered try again sending item , but it now november 30th . item stock whole time so i'm not sure what caused delay . i'm just thankful i ordered it just try it out , i didn't actually need it any certain date .	-1
i din't love these all . flavor combinations struck me off , there no improvement pistachio taste adding harissa . also texture unpleasant , somewhat soggy . i like healthy aspect , but if you aren't enjoying experience why eat all	-1
i ordered chocolate mint variety . amazon them great price shipped them quickly . however , i ordered cookies early november , they arrived " best when used " date december 4 , 2006 . they expire less than month after they arrived!i'm not sure if this amazon fault or not . cookies shipped manufacturer back nature box , so it could company unloading older cases merchandise amazon.com	-1
i going buy these until i saw they contained trans fats ( partially hydrogenated vegetable oil cocoa crispies , fruit loops , corn pops ) . who wants send their kids off school loaded up deadly trans fats ?	-1
you really like spirulina enjoy these . entire center " green " . too strong my taste . try almond butter balls , they delicious	-1
home beyond true value offers this 12 pack coffee filters 40 each pack . i ordered two 12 packs 40 coffee filters each home beyond only sent two packs 40 . not 24 packs i ordered paid . my advice not business home beyond or true value when buying these coffee filters because they not ship what listing says . until amazon starts enforcing home beyond true value honor what they list their offerings , imho then buyers need go somewhere else . weight says 4.20 pounds . they trying say one tiny pack 40 paper coffee filters weighs 4.20 pounds ??	-1
these horrible . i thought i'd try raw foods i amde big mistake	-1
i've found timothy k-cups consistently good , better than green mountain varieties i tried ( i haven't found green mountain i like yet ! ) but parisian night first timothy offering didn't impress me . i bought two boxes it amazon tried using different brew strengths , but it always tastes bland . it bold strong advertised , but plebeian . someone who just bought keurig this blend their first cup , it might taste pretty good ; but compared all other , better k-cup varieties available , this one better off skipped . i think it just fancy name boring blend nothing distinctive it all . their " midnight " dark roast definitely more tasty , even better than their columbian italian k-cups , which very smooth . i think timothy best columbian k-cups market . but parisian night , well ... let just say everybody makes mistakes	-1
i bit disappointed these . they crumble very easily unusual texture . my son ( 6 ) not like them	-1
skippy pulls worst kind nonsense this product - claiming it all natural , which technically true , but also implying since it natural , it healthy , which false this product sice they ruined it . real peanut butter contains one ingredient : peanuts , maybe dash salt . nothing else . real peanut butter very good you . skippy adds palm oil , tropical oil which , while it slightlybetter than soem other tropical oils , still contains saturated fats completely unnecessary , this " spread " . why ? so poor widdle you doesn't spend whole four seconds stirring it . course , this would all lot more clear if amazon actually nutrtion labels available , but they don't - nor they carry any kind actual all-natural peanut butter . skip this , skip all so-called " peanut butters " carreied here , go yoru local store get soem real natural peanut butter . look label - if it any other ingredient than peanuts salt , put it back shelf . nothing else necessary	-1
i drink all types teas , but this one worst tasting teas , my opinion	-1
i wanted like this bar because it high protein fiber , but it also unfortunately high added sugars ( 31g ! ) . it much too sweet . if they took away some sugar , it might edible .	-1
quality this tea not very good , especially compared other superb teas two leaves bud . mostly powder inside bag , very strong " grassy " smell somewhat bitter aftertaste . top it took 2 weeks amazon deliver it .	-1
donot buy it . i got stuff even past expiration day	-1
viewer pointed out this product contains corn syrup not all organic . fact only organic thing this product fig . those us trying maintain healthy organic eating lifestyle you must read list ingredients before assuming front label accurate . this goes all products not all attack against paul newman products which my family consume we enjoy their products truly organic	-1
i really like splenda , but this hazelnut flavor distinctly over-chemicaled taste just doesn't much nuttiness it . perhaps other flavors better	-1
i wouldn't describe this jerky shredded but instead powdered . it not something you tap into your hand eat like snack . best use we found pour one little tubes onto salad added protein . still , it fairly short shelf life jerky ; unopened tubes gone bad ( mold ? or something ? ick ) within 3 months	-1
it not regular , strong earl grey twinings i come love . this version lacks strength flavor - two teabags needed regular strength tea . it even states box - light flavour strenght ( 2 leaves out five ) . beware !	-1
newly re-packaged twinings earl grey tea ( word " classics " package ) much , much weaker than previous twinings earl grey tea . if you used like old teas , then you won't like new version . i wonder if they weakened britsh version twinings earl grey tea	-1
i very disappointed this product . i sure i tried cherries this company but these " off " flavor extremely sweet . i gave away 4 bags i bought .	-1
this biscotti just awful , too sweet too hard . la tempesta real biscotti	-1
5 stars stevia product ... natural , delicious ! 0 stars amazon inability correctly store this item their warehouses . i experienced same trouble other reviewers , packets showing up hard useless . when purchased store , i never one hard or brittle packet . don't bother purchasing amazon , instead head your local trader joe where you purchase 100 packets $5.99 . not fiber supplement type , but doesn't clump more per packet . amazon really shouldn't even bother selling this product if stevia shows up ruined	-1
i should known there something fishy when product details said product dimensions 13 10.5 2.5 inches 3.8 pounds when shipping weight said 2.15 pounds . actuality it 12 10 2.5 comes cheap ( not even know if it wood ) box it weighs 1.14 pounds my postal scale . however , fair , i not taken plastic wrapper off because it gift so it could very , very thin wood . addition , container opens like box rather than chest . there no hinges back . i am very disappointed this tea " chest " it price	-1
i bought this thinking it going good healthy snack raspberries . i surely mistaken . raspberries coated sugar , other syrupy stuff it tastes like you eating gummy bears ! gross	-1
amazon never sent correct order . i spend 2 hours phone trying get them send right item . i eventually decline order 3rd time not getting correct amount pop-tarts . they kept sending once box when i supposed get 12	-1
price this all other 100 calorie packs one box . this means you paying almost two dollars per ounce . this most ridiculous sham i ever encountered . difference price this item amazon this item grocery store outrageous . ( this costs over ten dollars more here than grocery store !!!!	-1
i looking forward this item , but i sent cheaper , non-organic version twice . amazon informed me they couldn't guarantee when problem would fixed . if someone orders this gets organic version , please post . i'd love buy these future !	-1
this purchase my husband . ( need i say more , ladies ? ) this soup(if you even call it ) waste money . there hardly any seafood it all , what little there , it small pieces . it more like ' cream ' . my son husband both big soup eaters , love chowder . let just say he bought case stuff 10 cans still sitting pantry awaiting next garbage day ! i admit i didn't try it ... it didn't smell or look appealing . but if my husband ( human garbage ) says it awful stuff , i take his word it .... so should you !	-1
edited review : my first order came leaking jars . amazon replaced second order arrived good condition . one star , which i can't seem change , reflected fact . my updated review three stars . i mildy disappointed this topping . out jar , black olives artichokes provide flavor definate sour notes . texture ingrediants pasty ( opposed chunky ) . i would given this only two stars if this supposed pasta sauce . however , i followed directions jar create their version bruschetta . it acceptable . since this billed " topping " i am willing give it three stars since capacity performs pleasurable level . vodka sauce much more my liking .	-1
if you really like chinese food , you might like this chicken stew . however , it much too sweet tasting my tastes . main reason i give it 2 stars it contains artificial sweetner splenda ( see " sucralose " ingredients ) , but not advertised anywhere package besides small print ingredient list . i personally don't eat or drink products contain artificial sweetners various reasons , i known product contained splenda , i wouldn't purchased it honestly . it typical splenda " after taste .	-1
it not quite bad i expected , but strawberry delight flavor frosted mini-wheats suffer most how it looks , unnatural pink color dyed into wheat biscuits such way make them wholly unappetizing . otherwise , it offers sweetened taste barely reminds me real strawberries , least point where you wonder what point this variation kellogg . one 42-gram serving , mini-box , equals higher-than-average 140 calories but only five fat . other good news there no measurable sodium cholesterol cereal . i would think adding real strawberries or even dried berry variations would preferable this cereal , so i think i'll leave this pass	-1
i bought two flavors gloria jeans k-cups . i loved price . coffee wonderful (!) , but i hate getting grounds my coffee ! i've 1 5 cups coffee grounds * under * filter , so when coffee brews they end up my cup -- 1/2 teaspoon per cup . lower price = poorer manufacturing standards .	-1
says it all . this cereal just too sweet . their flax cereal better	-1
granola very dry not too sweet . need milk . i prefer costco granola -- it taste much better . i would not recommend purchase this product . now i got find way get rid other 5 packages . also bought fruit nut one . hope that better .	-1
i bought case , they expire one month . they taste great , but shame amazon . i also bough butter rounds , they expired last year	-1
this jello cheesecake mix not nearly tasty their sugar-free banana cream mix ( one tastes like * real * banana cream ! ) . this mix not flavour cheesecake , also vague chemically taste .	-1
although i like consider myself open ' cultural cuisine ' , i found myself spitting this stuff out - after paying $6 it international marketplace . my significant other same . i like salty stuff , i love licorice , but this just plain nasty . not only it too salty , but it terrible rubbing-alcohol-type flavor went up my nose made me wonder if perhaps candy tampered or manufactured incorrectly . i went online read some other reviews ... other people similar experiences . i guess it one those acquired tastes developed early . oh , those dutch !! i love ' em ( but hate this " candy " )	-1
i ordered both this honey nut version . i wish i paid more attention low fat part this version . this version hard too cinnamon/sugary which seems happen w/ some low-fat cereals . they compensate low fat sugaring it up end up w/ hard less tasty less filling product . however , honey nut version very good . it good crunch , but not too hard tasty almond slivers it . it sweet , but not overly granola , no cinnamon taste all . i understand many products w/ raisins add cinnamon i typically like cinnamon , but this version too much raisins too dried out hard . package very convenient though . i now mix regular version w/ this product help me get rid low fat stuff . some label info : low fat w/ raisin ( lf ) 180 calories per 1/2 cup while honey nut ( hn ) only 20 more 200 . there 12 1/2 cup servings hn while lf only 10 . product weight hn 24 oz lf 20.5 oz . finally sugars hn 11g while lf 15g	-1

i purchased diamond pecans their shells december ' 06 ( note , not these , already shelled ones ) discovered after kids eating them they all rancid . sure check dates ( if you , there weren't any in-shell nuts ) because there not much worse than ruining whatever you're trying make rancid nuts . i learned only purchase pecans places dates package or where i smell taste them	-1
i agree quality nothing sneeze . these fill me up , i know they're pretty good you , i like nutty essence too . i guess i really disappointed taste , though . chocolate slightly bitter-tasting , took me surprise . i love other flavors , but this one my leat favorite . i would recommend almond butter balls before this one , they're soft little more sweet side	-1
i bought these because they described : " 100% all-natural dry roasted almonds " . now i read label states these contain : maltodextrin , modified potato starch , sugar , msg , autolyzed yeast extract , modified corn syrup solids , modified corn starch , salt ...	-1
this terrible tasting bar . i tried many raw bars this one far worst i've ever tasted . it leaves after taste .	-1
this type machine just cannot make good espresso . espresso must made fine grind beans , correct temperature water , high water pressure extract right amount flavor beans right amount time . quick/no-fuss machine like tassimo , some these ingredients missing this machine process , so espresso turns out rather sour . adding latte milk covers up worst it , but it not great latte either . stick regular coffee tassimo , although it not wonderful either , it might get you through morning	-1
not fooled this sugar coated seemingly delectable pastry ! i long time fan original pop-tart go-tart just seemed like natural progression things , so i went newest technology mass produced baked goods . go-tart offers you pop-tart go , because everyone knows this 21st century we move . i'm venturing guess go-gurt success so why not make go-tart ? well , there number reasons . actually just one . you already eat pop tart go . it too bad go-tart ruined everything i loved pop-tart . greatest hope i this flop product frosting ( or what you'd like call sugary stuff top ) would reach corners tart , unlike original pop-tart . though sugar covers corners , there barely any frosting all this tart ! it but thin line sugary goodness we would all expect normal pop-tart . filling gooey consistency , worst all , breading part crumbled my hand . i eat my go-tart pieces . this clearly not go . this worse than pop-tart , probably more fattening than one . save your money , boycott go-tart	-1
i excited get these but not read ingrediants before purchasing . big mistake . me they far too sweet almost sappy tasting . i dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some those chewy snakcs they make kids . high fructose insane really i feel they would better off fraction what they add .	-1
i tried one bite this cracker throw it away fear cracking my teeth . buy wasa 7 grain instead -- 7 grain light crispy	-1
not great coffee . rocamojo puravida , which amazon also sells so much better -- those aren't great just good . this cheap coffee tastes like it . i can't complain much $3 pound but it just ok , drinkable , but wouldn't buy again .	-1
i'm sorry , but these just weren't me , they somewhat stale taste . i recommend buying single bag before buying case if you all hesitant	-1
too salty me , there better brand out there	-1
they sounded good , but aren't tart enough my taste prepared too much sugar	-1
i thought this product reasonably good taste , but i two major issues it . first , they describe this kettle corn . it not kettle corn - not even close . this caramel corn thick sweet coating . real kettle corn slightly sweet , slightly salty popcorn . second , each very small bag 1.5 servings it . when last time you opened small bag snack food only ate 2/3 it ? they purposely made serving size unrealistic make it look healthier . whole point paying individual size bags it limits you set portion . remember when coke 1.5 servings it ? fda made them change label . if you eat whole bag , you eating 200 calories popcorn . no better bag potato chips or few cookies , so this not lesser evil - it just same old junk food new name . i won't buy this product again . it same stuff you get anywhere	-1
i bought two flavors gloria jeans k-cups . i loved price . coffee good , but i hate getting grounds my coffee ! i've 1 5 cups coffee grounds * under * filter , so when coffee brews they end up my cup -- 1/2 teaspoon per cup . lower price = poorer manufacturing standards	-1

i prefer this powdered milk condensed form meyerberg sells . condensed more sour flavor it . one realize goat milk not cow milk it richer or creamier flavor so it startle one until your palate get used something which tastes " different " . when it warm , it honestly tastes close what milk product should taste . cold it slight powdered milk processed flavor . i actually made ice cream this powdered milk it turned out pretty good . it like ice milk this milk , but it different enjoyable but quite swee t.t he recipe 1 quart milk ( 8 scoops powdered milk made warm allowed chill)1 cup white sugar1 tsp vanilla flavoring ( you try other flavorings like banana)1/8 tsp saltmy electric freezer freeze this 20 minutes . i like powdered it ease it keeps well . i make up quart it keep 2 weeks , so it hand not wasting or forcing someone who limited use drink gallon milk . granted one used cow milk , but this something one get used if they allergies i am glad it comes nice metal plastic lid reseal after you pop top plastic measuring scoop get it right . one make 3 quarts milk	1
espresso beans roasted different ways . lavazza illy represent best two different approaches roasting beans italian espresso . illy roasts their beans longer time , but lower temperature , than lavazza . result its higher roasting temperature lavazza darker , according some people more robust , than illy . its best , when properly ground , tamped , brewed , lavazza espresso bit stronger tasting also little bit more bitter than illy . lavazza espresso also very pure black color once brewed when it properly it hint licorice aftertaste . personally , though , i prefer illy approach which why i am giving this coffee four rather than five stars . but , even so , i certainly recognize high quality lavazza . my opinion lavazza represents very best widely available dark ( opposed medium like illy ) italian espresso roasts	1

now , one reviewers this product complained sugar content this cereal only looking ingredients list , which not how determine nutritional value any product ( especially when reviewer cannot distinguish nutritive non-nutritive ingredients ) . this cereal just many simple sugars frosted flakes , but cereal not claim low sugar . what important this cereal it offers quite bit fiber vitamins/minerals ( not much some cereals , but since i no deficiencies this area , i didn't mind ) . also , it only 3 times salt half cup milk which not loaded . healthy choice soup , now loaded salt . now , i chose this cereal replacement frosted flakes/honey nut cheerios , which against my better judgment i continued every morning . i should point out i don't drink coffee mornings i don't drink soda ( less than 1 week average ) . i also eat no sweets . simple sugars ( listed just " sugars " nutrition label ) seem treated like carcinogens , while most people don't realize aspartame ( artificial sweetener most diet sodas ) really one . if your diet already low sugar you feel confident you burn through those sugars pretty quick ( since i don't drink caffeinated drinks , i need jolt morning ) , then this good choice . if your diet already quite bit sugar or your doctor tells you cut down simple sugars ( or you also couple cups caffeinated coffee sugar every morning ) , then go bran cereal without oat clusters syrups ( which i really not like much ) . also , if you concerned total carbs , please note normal 2000 calories diet would include 300g carbohydrates ( so yes , high protein diets contradict this ) . since taste completely subjective , i won't put much emphasis it . my opinion , it tastes pretty good ( but i don't consume many sweets during day ) .	1

i use this mostly my coffee tea find it adds kind sweetness i enjoy . i've others try it some liked it much i , others said it wasn't them . i remember reading years ago stevia slight licorice taste it , but i don't detect any sort taste all . my online research leads me believe might something inulin fiber ( fos ) thats also part this sweetener . i tried splenda didn't like it . everyone tastes body chemistry different , but if you're looking reduce amount sugar your diet without feeling like you suffering it , then give this try	1

this best tasting shredded (= dessicated ) coconut i found anywhere usa . it organic sulfite free . this unsweetened , finely shredded , very small pieces dessicated coconut which used south east asia , australia etc . this not same product american style coconut , which most common type baker sweetened angel flake coconut . i like buy finely shredded/dessicated coconut because i often bake australian , british european style cakes cookies , which not work well when made flake coconut . i also discovered finely shredded coconut used make your own coconut milk or coconut cream home . flake coconut dessicated coconut different taste texture . cup sweetened angel flake coconut 2 tablespoons sugar added it , so it very sweet compared shredded/dessicated coconut , which no added sugar all . shredded/dessicated coconut drier pieces very small compared flakes , so it more surface area . because these two things , 8oz dessicated coconut absorb more liquid than 8oz flake coconut . some recipes work quite well either kind coconut , but others not , even if you compensate sugar liquid . its better , especially baking , use whatever recipe originally calls . coconut i received amazon tasted very fresh good use date . if you want increase shelf life coconut , throw bags into freezer or refrigerator . they keep there year . once bag opened , i always keep it refrigerator . i don't like buying this kind coconut health food stores , it often comes bulk bins exposed air . unsweetened organic coconut get stale or even develop rancid taste if it stored open air . sweetened flake coconut much more stable because it contains preservatives sugar . if you australian wanting make things like lamingtons or coconut ice , you need use dessicated/finely shredded cooconut . flake coconut not give right results . dessicated/finely shredded coconut also excellent replicating those little coconut macaroon cookies you find many chinese buffet restaurants . shredded/dessicated coconut mixed water make your own coconut milk or coconut cream . i find this useful because i rarely use more than 1/2 when i cook coconut milk ( curries , soups , laksa etc ) . sometimes i only want spoonful or two , add little flavor smoothie or banana cake . i tried making coconut milk flake coconut , but my taste , it way too sweet not good texture . make coconut milk dessicated coconut : method 1 . put equal parts coconut hot water weight into blender ( eg 8oz coconut 1 cup hot water ) . whizz blender minute or two . if desired , you strain press it through cloth or fine sieve when it cooled down . this not necessary most recipes , unless you require silky smooth texture end product . lighter coconut milk , use 8oz coconut one half cups water , or you use " lite " shredded coconut start . method 2 . simmer equal parts weight coconut hot water until froth appears . not boil . remove heat let it sit until it cools down . if desired , you strain it through cloth bag or very fine sieve , pressing out much liquid possible . make thick coconut cream dessicated coconut : use either method above , but use 4 parts coconut one part water . i thought price amazon excellent , especially organic product . time purchase , it worked out one dollar forty two cents per 8oz bag my case , shipping free . i can't find organic dessicated coconut anywhere else this price . overall i very pleased taste , freshness , price quality this coconut . i don't think i any problems using up 12 packets one year , especially i won't buying any cans coconut milk .	1

taste ok , but not great . one thing this somewhat annoying it two serving packet which means it makes 16 ounces liquid . i really only want eat up 8 ounces time . means i guess how much half then roll up bag save remaining portion . even if i want eat entire packet , i don't bowl 16 ounces ( all my bowls perfectly normal sized ) . bottom line here there nothing wrong taste soup ( still , i'm not love it ) . i just wish there better way packaging . i'm only one eating it , maybe affects my opinion . if you more than one person your family then it won't problem all , you ignore everything i've said .	1

i love soups stews i am love this seafood chowder . it absolute best flavor chock full variety seafood . taste great !! i've tried many many chowders this ranks highest any i ever eaten .... even legal seafood or wolfgang puck or several local massachsetts seaside restaurants . it all natural no artificial ingredients . i recommend this everyone who loves seafood chowders . all baxter soups chowders , this really only one i recommend everyone try . i repeat ... it great !! it bit high salt though ..... ~ 1,400 mg/can but if this only salty food eaten all day ... it ok . try it .... it heavenly !	1

when mini-wheats first came out grocery store , i tried them . however , i found they bland . it like trying eat sticks milk . then came " frosted " mini-wheats . okay , i decided give it go . now i sticks sugar milk . however , i find out if you forego milk just eat them straight box , like potato chips , they excellent ! now kellogg added fruity flavors mini-wheat . these i eat milk ! yippee ! finally ! i picked up " strawberry delight " bite size . even though i eat them milk , i find i still prefer just eat them straight box , like potato chips , type chex-mix , or square wheat thin snack . each serving 140 calories . compare other cereals you'll see it 60 - 100 calories less . no saturated fat . no trans fat . no cholesterol . no sodium . total fat only 0.5 according box . i don't see how , since zero zero , well , zero . but i live 0.5 . here bad news , carbohydrates . there 35g carbs here . but same all other brands . diabetics may want pass this due 10g sugar per serving . remember , single serving size half base ball . not much . so if you just pouring cereal into " cereal bowl " without measuring , you probably getting 2 or 3 servings one bowl . all-in-all , unless you diabetic , this mini-wheat terrific ! reviewed detra fitch huntress reviews	1

i using navitas natural organic raw cacao nibs four months now it gives me feeling happiness , well energy day . we add it our fruit smoothie morning . i don't eat chocolate dairy sugar it gives me pimples . however i tolerate nibs .	1
while i'm quite impressed health claims these nibs , frankly they taste like dirt !

i love granola cereal general , but i say this very best granola i ever . people bear naked philosophy i love , which back every bag : " we believe food should hand-made wholesome natural ingredients you actually pronounce . " although i eat processed food , i appreciate appeal more traditionally prepared foods , this granola tops list nutrition taste . like most granola , it high calories fat , but take note fat comes largely nuts contained ( it also contains expeller pressed canola oil ) , it no trans fat , only 1.5 saturated fat per serving . this cereal softer than most granola , though not soft enough me consider it chewy . it large chunks nuts also contains cranberries flax seed , optimal nutritional digestive health . six-pack sold amazon makes price per package reasonable ( ingredients quite expensive ) , so value proposition , i think this not only great product , but great buy . delicious nutritious : great combination i recommend highly	1

ah , it definite american story - 1969 friends mo siegel wyck hay colorado began selling herbal teas they previously only made themselves . such small beginnings came famous tea company - celestial seasonings . among celestial seasonings ' many products sleepytime , herbal infusion such wonderfully different taste i able win my wife over it , she not consider herself tea drinker . many evenings when i brew up some sleepytime go my famous spiced bread ! anyway , sleepytime largely mixture chamomile spearmint , which produces healthy drink wonderful aroma taste . i'm sure i cannot adequately describe taste - it doesn't taste like anything you've ever tried before , but its seductive flavors win you over . if i could make one suggestion celestial seasonings , it would change name something else . i've friends refuse try it , afraid tea make them feel drowsy . you buy sleepytime valerian root , which definitely promotes sleepiness , but regular product just pleasant herbal drink . i suppose it called sleepytime because its fresh spearmint tastes very good late evening , its natural lack caffeine means it won't keep you awake . but , this wonderful product tastes great any time day ! way , it also makes unique , zingy iced tea	1

though i'm not into so called " guilt-free " foods eat mainly fruits , vegetables , whole grains , beans low-fat dairy , i days when i need make sure i get enough protein pinch . these soy chips often fill gap , new baby house ( who cared full time his mom lieu various mechanical other devices such swings , bouncers , teddy-bears womb sounds , etc ) i'm not cooking quite so much . plus , i don't much taste meat , though i'm not vegetarian . i don't eat many processed foods , these soy chips lower end processed side things , my opinion , they don't bunch dyes , perservatives , etc , just soy flour , rice , oil , salt , spices ... one could much worse . particular , i found them helpful road trips when you don't know when you'll encounter something decent eat ( don't room cooler ) plane trips . few pieces fruit , i've carried through many dicey food situation these non-perishable soy chips . 2 hour ride airport , 2+ hour flight average 2 hour luggage retrieval dash hotel or other lodgings long time go without something eat these days superb airline service . besides , who ever really liked , or much less could argue sound nutrition airplane food anyway ? chips pack lot heart healthy soy protein ( 24 grams per 385 calorie bag ) , low fat sugar . also , bag compressed much smaller size carry-on economy if you don't mind some crushed chips . they may not salad healthy entree cover page meal , but they giant leap up vast majority vending machine , convenience store , grocery snack aisle trash . downside them they relatively high sodium , but if rest your diet pretty low salt you aren't trouble blood pressure , you're probably ok there . i really love new amazon.com grocery venture because one , i get these soy chips 12 packs . price works out just over 50% cost per bag i'd pay any grocery store where i live . when i two cases time get over $25 barrier , i get free shipping which really seals deal . my dad kids me i'm amazon.com junkie whenever he sees package amazon.com his box , he knows who sent it . this not prompted plug amazon , i just really like their service , grocery especially	1

call me traditionalist , but i prefer original , jam-filled pop tarts none overly sweet frosting top . child , i liked it right out toaster would take it me way school . this portable variation seems me like misstep outset . moment i ripped open flimsy packaging , go-tart bar crumbled out my hand onto floor . apparently manufacturers kellogg decided use same bread-like consistency they use their standard pop-tarts this bar . especially shipping aspect introduced amazon , i think this mistake since i assume whole idea behind this iteration snack portability aspect . top bar same execrable , sprinkle-laden white frosting i avoided once it introduced enhancement so many years ago . without ability toasting bar , i find little point frosting except purposeless sugar-rush . consequently , i cannot agree its description " ready-to-eat bar " . one bar , little over ounce , 140 calories , thirty which fat . even though there more fattening bars you could eat , it still excessive-sounding 140 mg sodium . i only tried " frosted strawberry " variation because it part free promotional package i received amazon promote their new non-perishable grocery line . i think i'll just stick granola bar if i get kind munchies this bar targeted satisfy	1

melitta coffee certainly one better brands , i really like each pod individually wrapped . i bought this because senseo hazelnut not stock time . caution senseo coffee maker users : melitta pod not fit well senseo pod holders . single pod holder too small melitta pod , double pod holder too big one melitta pod , too small two melitta pods . i found coffee just bit weak side , but this may only because i used it senseo machine .	1

i excited try this product i love oreos , but don't like all garbage goes into them . we tried newman-o originals ... my wife went first , look her face said it all . still , i see myself . we both decided they taste like wood chips disguised oreo cookies . some reason , others seem think they taste great . just yourself favor try small before you buy large ..	-1
this mix very sour , because way fruits dried , there lot crumbs inside packets	1

i thought this product reasonably good taste , but i two major issues it . first , they describe this kettle corn . it not kettle corn - not even close . this caramel corn thick sweet coating . real kettle corn slightly sweet , slightly salty popcorn . second , each very small bag 1.5 servings it . when last time you opened small bag snack food only ate 2/3 it ? they purposely made serving size unrealistic make it look healthier . whole point paying individual size bags it limits you set portion . remember when coke 1.5 servings it ? fda made them change label . if you eat whole bag , you eating 200 calories popcorn . no better bag potato chips or few cookies , so this not lesser evil - it just same old junk food new name . i won't buy this product again . it same stuff you get anywhere	-1

overall nuts soft lacked flavor we hoped . price we could better .	1
while you could lot worse other snacks , much health benefit eating " fruit " this product outweighed chemical additives . high fructose corn syrup dextrose many , many grocery products , but they not " natural " this manufacturer claims . both chemicals manufactured labs not easily digested body . hfc it called , linked high quantities escalating onset diabetes . i not tried this product , so i can't comment taste . i would like try dried fruit product , one which truly natural not laden chemical additives .	-1
i tried almost all hemp protein products out there , love eating powder raw . but nutiva product not taste good all , compared other products it tastes like dirt , its not milled fine powder , its very coarse so it crunchy if you decide blend it anything . only thing going this product it packs more fiber than other brands . if your looking good tasting hemp protein go living harvest , manitoba harvest or ruth hemp protein . i eat hemp religiously so trust me , take my advice avoid this one . bottoms up ! hemp powder most complete source protein out there , easy digest	-1

i throw out almost all these raisins because they contained crawly things and/or what looks like droppings crawly things . i must say i generally love newman products , i willing give these raisins benefit doubt . natural products , sometimes bugs get them . that part territory organic matter . but i found white grubs little brown dots weren't part raisins box after shrink-wrapped box . some boxes fine , i ate raisins them , but majority tainted . i'll need assured there improvement quality control before i try newman snack-pack organic raisins again	-1

grocery store saturated products high sugar fat frankly i've become weary reading labels . i've started buy more more organic products find many them meet or exceed my expectations flavor quality . nature path organic apple cinnamon toaster pastries taste " slightly " healthy , but they remind me some nutmeg cookies i make also made whole-wheat flour . ingredients : organic apple cinnamon filling ( organic evaporated cane juice , organic apple juice concentrate , water , organic evaporated apples , vegetable glycerin , organic apple powder , organic corn startch , organic cinnamon , locust bean gum ) , organic whole-wheat flour , organic white flour , water , organic evaporated cane juice , organic palm oil , powdered organic eveaporated cane juice , organic invert syrup , salt , leavening , natural flavor , agar , tocopherols ( freshness ) . unfortunately these contain palm oil , although i don't seem allergic organic palm oil . makes me wonder what i'm really allergic , what additional element non-organic palm kernel oil . could it simply this non-hydrogenated version . could . each pastry 190 calories 40 calories fat they heat up fast toaster convenient snack . ~ rebecca review	1

i like these lot . they only slightly salty , bit molasses sweetness , all balanced against mild licorice flavor . they medium-hard very chewy , although they must kept airtight container or they get too hard . personally i would prefer stronger licorice flavor , but these still among my favorites . salty licorice indeed strange thing those who haven't tried it before . if you've never it before , don't start case ( like what sold here ) . definitely stay away double salt licorice until you've learned whether you like saltiness . if you want black licorice but don't want salty flavor , try " haribo licorice wheels " . those more licorice flavor than these coins , less other flavor . they're bit sweet bit softer . note these coins also come bags . buying them way slightly more cost-effective , but tubs might little more airtight	1

i ordered this soup bunch others my goldbox special few weeks ago . soup comes individually packaged microwavable cups easy take work or school you . upon microwaving , soup flavor very good but dehydrated items inside ( particularly noodles beans ) hard crunchy . after letting dehydrated items soak few minutes , i tried it it perfect . very good flavor , but it very strong garlic component flavor , maybe little too strong . i would recommend further diluting soup down which would entail emptying contents into larger bowl heating , defeating point microwavable cups . i would purchase this soup again if it offered goldbox price nine bucks 12 pack . but price currently offered , i'm not certain i would go it again . nevertheless , flavor good if you like strong flavor convenience individually packaged cups , it might worth shot ordering it one time see if you love it	1

originally looked buy wasa light rye , but it out-of-stock . so , bought sourdough rye multi grain instead , glad i because they broadened my selection favorite wasa brand crispbreads . while i normally avoid products yeast , i feel toasty crispness multi grain neutralized any negative aspects ( yeast negative my story , i'm stickin ' it ! ) may derived containing yeast . varied uses , it equally great strengthening teeth ( should great weight loss adjunct because it not easy eat fast , requires some mastication which should satisfy need eaten ) when eaten cracker , or mechanically grinding pouder use coat salmon coquettes . oh , some more good news moths try eat through package rye crispbreads , which means what inside edible humans too . i keep mine stored freezer because it so valuable . should good nutrient source case prolonged emergencies well . still my preference among all wasa crispbreads light rye . only 2 ingredients , rye flour sea salt . just give me simple life ... without two accompanying airheads , .	1

this stuff great ! it funny all previous reviews said use this if your child can't drink cow milk .... no , use this instead cow milk !!! :d this so much better your baby than cow milk ... it much closer human milk than cow milk . goat much closer us than cow ... cow chew cud 4 stomachs .... they eat food , regurgitate it later finish chewing it , then it goes through several processing chambers/stomachs . think it , baby cow drinking milk it mama going process it food same way mama cow processing her , we don't 4 stomachs , why would our babies drink milk ???... why should we think cow milk going sufficient our needs ? goat graze , they eat little bits food all day , their food steadily processes through their bodies ( hence if you ever around goats you'll see they eat poop , eat poop ... it process very quickly through their bodies . just like we , we process our food very quickly need foods we digest/absorb very quickly easily . that really why cow milk not best us ... not just because lactose all hormone/antibiotic stuff ( yeah stuff too but that not main reason ) . however , it main source you see because it cheap easy obtain , thin how many goats it would take produce same amt milk cow produces ... it all supply demand . but heck anyone could own goat milk it , easily ! i can't wait farm my own someday so i goat milk whole family ! :d but meyenberg powdered milk , this stuff so easy mix so convenient toddler !!! just take it you mix it whenever you need it , don't worry it spoiling fridge or running out go store find they out . i really wanted keep breastfeeding beyond year but my supply just couldn't keep up my son needs point . so i weaned him given him some cow milk mostly goat milk now i pretty much stayed only goat milk . i tell he likes flavor much better , his bm not loose watery like cow , he doesn't much gas this either . gosh what excellent price !!!! thanks amazon !	1

my local whole foods sells nature path products $3.79 box , so this amazon.com price excellent deal . cereal hearty crunchy , although it becomes soft few short minutes when submerged milk . i sometimes add little sweetner , sugar not added artificially . my housemate ( who grew up france italy ) , loves this cereal , he says it reminds him his european ' grainy ' musli-style cereals . however , i am not big fan what sold ' musli ' or ' muslix ' this country heritage bites nothing like this . think chex style bites crunch , without chex fake crunch , slimy coating , preservatives sugars .	1

i grew up kraft boy , you wouldn't find me off-brand boxes macaroni cheese . no , sir . just authentic best me . when i got older , i realized ( thanks mark bittman superb cookbook , how cook everything -- if you happen vicinity bookstore , pick it up ) boxed stuff horrid , compared making actual pasta actual cheese . but , well , sometimes i just want something out box . ( our seven-year-old always , he insane tasteless taste buds child . ) those cases , i always went back kraft , until we started shopping whole foods bought pack annie try out -- very skeptically my case , i'd lot off-brand stuff failed live up kraft ideal . even so-called " premium " " deluxe " stuff like velveeta shells cheese just totally weird off-putting . but , heresy heresies , it turns out annie stuff actually better than kraft . both regular box powder , this stuff cheese-gel , taste better than kraft , through some feat food science alchemy . try ' em out . personally , i give nod deluxe over regular , just because it twice easy make ( no mixing milk , butter , powder -- just rip pouch mix noodles ) , " easy make " pretty much whole point boxed food ; but it lot more expensive , so if you're price-conscious willing put forth bit effort , get regular annie . ( or , better yet , get bittman book , learn make pasta sage parmesan same price just much work ...	1
annie deluxe macaroni cheese comes pouch cheese sauce , which tastes better than any dry powder variety it quicker mix . regardless how thoroughly i mix cheese powder , milk butter , dry powder varieties not taste good annie deluxe . our 3 year old really enjoys annie deluxe i feel better offering her this rather than kraft macaroni cheese . even if taste wasn't good kraft , i would choose annie since ingredients natural some organic . kraft uses artificial color their dry powder macaroni cheese , though i don't think they their deluxe version . kids ( adults ) don't need artificial colors ! i would give annie deluxe 5 if they would reduce sodium content make deluxe version included whole wheat pasta all organic ( currently only some dry powder versions all organic ) . while i am creating my dream version , i would give annie 10 if they would enrich it some calcium other vitamins make whole wheat bunny shape version ! :) my big hangup sodium too high ( like all other brands ) . it would still taste great lot less salt ( if kids not given high sodium first place , their taste buds don't crave it ) . unless pasta whole wheat ( or other whole grain ) , there isn't much nutrition it , so whole wheat pasta enriched way go ! annie offers many varieties include some improvements i am looking , but it would great if they would include them all one version . boxed macaroni cheese truly junk food no matter who manufacturer , but annie doing great things make it better . knowing macaroni cheese often " kid food " reason enough improve it nutritionally . price reasonable amazon walmart , however most grocery chains wholefoods charge too much ! best price i found annie home website when they offered 25% off free shipping	1
