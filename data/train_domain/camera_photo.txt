bought these my nikon d200 3 months ago . never used tiffen before i took chance recommendation . vignetting issue polarizing filters vignetting this one worse i've seen . build quality all filters really not very good . going go back hoya which much better	-1
i am not impressed tiffen filters i got this set . finish rings poor . despite previously poor reputaion , i recently purchased some 67mm quantaray filter local ritz camera store which much better quality compared this set tiffen filters . i never got tiffens before , good experience hoyas . i probably stay those now . now come think it , ritz camera indicated quantaray they made hoya . glass all filters quite bit more reflective compared hoyas quantarays . not good sign . circular polarizer some smudges some lense swirl after 10 sheets lense tissue quite bit cleaning solution failed fully cleared off . quite frustrating . all filters came lint few little smudges them , not sure if store handling or manufacturer handling blame , but none other filters i got before this kind problem right out box . set might cheap , but it sure good reason	-1
i paid extra air next day service . item advertised available ready ship immediately . item eventually arrived two weeks later . i left trip . item eventually sent back merchant . merchant didn't credit me item returned . i email merchant wait 2 weeks before item credited . i won't buy willoughby again	-1
i am my third off-camera cord ( one per year ) . two broken . other reviewers noted , four screws under metal retaining clip " female " end cord loosen eventually fail . i found thin narrow knife used remove black " spring " cover over screws shoe . you then tighten screws screwdriver . if you use locktite screws then they not loosen . canon should this factory . i use this cord stroboframe " portrait/landscape " grip which raises flash over camera six inches thus eliminating red eye providing much more pleasing light . stroboframe grip comes right size threaded screw this cord . when my cords failed i lost extended-through lens metering just like reviewer noted . i am not professional photographer only use camera occasionally yet cord still fails . canon should re-engineer this cord make it more durable . unfortunately , i not believe there alternative cords . it looks like i need keep buying canon cords	-1
this kit just junk . quot ; deluxe blower brushquot ; cheap plastic blower tiniest size . there quot ; tweezersquot ; just folded aluminum sheet metal - there no way getting anywhere near my cameras . there few sheets lense tissue few swabs use cleaning solution . quot ; lintless cleaning clothquot ; 3quot ; 5quot ; piece something akin reusable paper towels you'll use three times then throw away . this kit not worth buying any price , because it not worth shipping charges	-1
nearly $100 , this adaptor provides very little ( 1.5 ) magnification . it also nuisance because you switch camera settings every time you use lens it function properly . this no big deal wide angle adaptor , which used infrequently me , but it when you want capture fleeting image distance . it lightweight , but cumbersome doesn't accept filters . real telephoto capabilities , get slr interchangeable lenses . i sent this product back .	-1
300mm this lens very soft , it hard get shot looks like it focus . so , you need shoot f/11 , then since there little light available , you usually bump iso 800 or 1600 just get acceptable shutter speed . course , high iso then introduces other artifacts . focus also dead slow often doesn't lock . this lens i constantly fought . don't upgrade new 70-300 either , it only marginally better . buy 70-200 f/4l . it far superior lens	-1
looks nice . unfortunately not power up camera , so i can't say much else . going cost me return shipping very least . sorry i didn't buy canon product instead	-1
i only wish i could return this camera . its automatic focus not work well photographing landscape scenes plants ( what i most ) its manual focus difficult ( very difficult ) use . my much cheaper , lower resolution , old minolta much better job low light conditions . i find i delete half my photographs due bad focus . addition , photo files take 5 6 seconds save my so-called high-speed memory card . don't buy this camera	-1
i bought this lens based super telephoto ability low cost . you truly get what you pay , this thing isn't worth plug nickel . i took few shots tripod could not believe how terrible this lens @ 300mm ( 480mm digital rebel xt ) . incredibly soft . even stopped down , i would never want make enlargement it . stay away . don't believe fools who novices , you disappointed this lens . you're much better off buy older used 100-300mm 5.6 ( version costs more too ) but both so much better than this junker . you're even more crazy if you think you take decent photo this lens handheld . switched nikon when switching digital , i almost judged canon this one lens , which i'm glad i didn't . don't waste your money or learn hard way like i . this lens also terrible purple fringing , almost bad kit 18-55mm . after extensive research testing i now own am happy following canon lenses : canon 10-22mmcanon 28-105mm ( 3.5 version)canon 100-300mm ( 5.6 non-l version ) i sell version when i afford it . kit 18-55mm makes usable shots , but when i could afford it , i sold it too . you get better results buying rebel xt older 100-300mm than you would brand new xti this terrible 75-300mm lens .	-1
i deeply dissapointed this lens hood . given cost 10% cost lens which it intended ( 70-300 this case ) i expected it stiff durable polycarbonate . -positives-fulfills basic function lens hood- prevents flare , etc . bayonet locking system excellent , much easier deal than scew-on type lens hoods . that it . -negatives-the polycarbonate so thin i half expect it translucen t.t he hood must gripped base remove it , grippng thin end hood may break it ; or least it feels like it may break it . its very long . especially 70-300 which already long lens , this makes fully extended zoom foot long . that pretty conspicuous . it very overpriced vs . generic lenses ($50 vs . $5-10 rubber or metal ) . i traded it went kalt rubber lens hood . 2 stars great bayonet design , but rest it weak	-1

like most people i got this camera because it quite compact quality image . i've pleased image quality when it works , but start it felt flimsy felt like it would die any rough treatment . sure enough : * shutter cover often stuck open or shut . * sometimes it refuses start all . * it sometimes powers you're putting it into your pocket , which opens barrel which got damage camera . * finally , lcd stopped working altogether . this after 8 months . casio decided i'm not under warranty ( no explanation why , no phone number argue them ) , charging me $97 repair it . don't seduced ! it poor quality product	-1
i received this filter it used , seals open case holds filters cracked , piece plastic floating loose inside , smug marks it . i shocked , i order amazon all time never anything show up like this .	-1

after just over year , my lens jammed display read " e18 " . so i pretty upset discover this extremely common defect - defect canon refuses admit . try googling canon s500 e18 " , you'll see what i meant . don't buy it unless you want very expensive paperweight	-1
average people who want camera just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this . i don't know specifics , but like other reviewers mine got stuck quit working no reason after couple months . so , i don't really see what all bells whistles if it doesn't even take picture . it fine while it worked , it ate batteries but pics good	-1

hello all , lens hoods pretty much necessity , but this mostly poorly made hood i've ever used . unlike other hoods screw , this one requires you press opposing clips then slide hood one , release clips . this leads problems alignment , meaning both sides clip need perfectly aligned order hood fit right . although it pain i hate ... i don't really alternative . either go w/o hood , or take this one . either way , guess i'd rather hood lense than not one	-1
close friend made unfortunate mistake plunking down 2 grand this camera . honestly olympus produces cameras same thing $400 . i've used hers image quality horrible colours wrong 9 times out 10 . if you're going spend much camera , get d70 instead buy nice extra lens or some other gadgets go . pictures better it offers more mp	-1
polarizing filters used eliminate glare non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they also used increase contrast color saturation your image . i use my polarizer not only eliminate glare , but also make skies nice shade blue or get some " pop " out clouds . there so many options consider when purchasing polarizing filter your needs . instance , linear vs . circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs . price . if you making use ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers designed work those features . linear polarizers their uses , but they manufactured differently may not work . unless you certain , just get circular polarizing filter . there some digital circular polarizers market . i am not sure what makes cir-pl lens better digital opposed film . i use canon 20d digital slr see no problems caused using supposed non-digital filter digital camera . most time , when it comes filters ; you get what you pay . mean you need expensive polarizer ? course not , just sure get right filter your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it color neutral prevent unwanted tinting . spending more color balanced filter save time post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money using step down rings . currently i use hoya pro1 filters , canon polarizing filters i previously owned without question bulkier heavier . weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items backpack all extra bits weight add up quickly . i spend good amount time my equipment my back so this big concern me . when it came down images , times i would see browning tint my photos . tint easy clean up photoshop cs2 , but i don't see problem hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it canon , it must quality . " since then i replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes cost disadvantages other similarly priced filters . pros : used film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections ghosting cons : bulky heavynot neutral color balance	-1
documentation terrible . its going take lot practice . if you're just going stick it top your camera its fine . however i want use it off-camera trigger 2 sb600s . just setting d200 fire pre-flash trigger sb800/masster sb600s it nightmare its not covered any detail , manual . sb800 designed this purpose . so why not include information how this ?	-1
i bought this lens my canon 30d after reading every professional review i could find . i knew going this lens wasn't perfect but , supposed better than 18-55 kit lens . i liked range it provided image stabilization . i shot pictures this lens extremely dissapointed . pictures not sharp all colors dull . i thought it might my new camera first because i couldn't imagine quality would this bad . i ruled this out after i used my canon 28-105 lens i my canon film slr results much better . digital focal length though , my old lens wouldn't suffice because 1.6 focal factor . later , i decided tamron 17-50/ 2.8 after reading reviews . salesperson professional camera store guessed my pictures very soft when i told him i this canon lens . he said , " let me guess , you'd like try tamron 17-50/ 2.8 . " he said this very best lens buy price range take it home try it . i could return it no questions asked if i wasn't satisfied . he also said he hadn't one person return it yet . my first images this lens great . they sharp way more vibrant color . there absolutely no comparison all . i hesitant buy third party lens but , my fears instantly eliminated after seeing results . this first review i ever posted amazon . i so dissapointed i wanted help others not make same mistake . after spending $$$ digital slr , it would waste not get great pictures it because lens . before taking chance buying canon , yourself big favor try canon tamron local store .	-1
i bought this monopod 3 weeks ago after reading reviews here . i'm not sure if i got defective unit but i've these problems gitgo : -i noticed 2 lower sections not open close smoothly , they would get stuck 2-3 inches lock you'd need force expand/retract them . very interestingly , if section right above one i'm trying expand/retract unlocked then operation smooth flawless ! -the ballhead not support my nikon d80 lightest lens ( 18-55mm ) less than 2 lbs combo , which much lighter than 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated specs . camera just slumps one direction or regardless how hard i try make sure ballhead locked tightly . again , it might defective unit , but i thought i'd point my observations out anyway . i wanted buy this amazon , it wasn't stock , it sitting my shopping cart when it became available amazon bumped price $40+ , so i went elsewhere got it $30 .	-1

i watch videos my kids my 50 " plasma , 32 " lcd mac , trying convince myself i like quality , my wife walks says , " fuzzy .

look feel this camcorder very good . unfortunately my camcorder use limited low light indoor activities . example , evening party , indoor school activities , kid drama orchestra . this camcorder not all suitable these activities . earlier i sony dcr trv140 , which way better than this camcorder . this camcorder very small sensor hence such low price . one easy guide evaluate sensor size look optical zoom . most camcorders more than 10x optical zoom small sensors . these large optical zoom camcorders perform poorly low light . if you planning use this camcorder low indoor light , i not recommend it .	-1
i owned s410 camera almost two years , when new years eve i pulled out my handy camera , padded case it always , my horror , e18 error message appeared ! it hasn't worked since . i paid $400 this camera canon would like $110 ( plus taxes ) fix problem - ridiculous . especially since this seems very common problem their cameras . i've enjoyed camera picture quality ease use , but what waste spend much money take pictures it just under two years ! beware this flaw canon doesn't seem acknowledge	-1
this first digital camera i purchased . i am adventurous person wanted something would stand up my lifestyle . this camera wasn't it . good*it compact , which pretty convenient*it several camera functions potential work well if you techno-savvy . bad*after snorkeling it 30 minutes , camera leaked broke . olympus replaced it , but only after my 2 month stay costa rica over . * functions unreliable difficult use . rarely if ever i get them work how i want . pictures always need touched up afterwards , sometimes seriously . * zoom sucks . don't expect get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you some serious patience . * image stabilization joke . you need tripod or surgeons hands take pictures aren't blurry . * user manual left me lot questions	-1

i bought this camera after owning olympus digital camera years . i extremely happy my olympus , but wanted something smaller would fit my purse or diaper bag since i'm expecting . this camera such disappointment . just every single picture i took huge white blobs all over it . ( this only happened when using flash . i must admit camera takes great pictures broad daylight without flash . ) plus , if you used zoom all , pictures came out fuzzy . first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! store i bought camera wouldn't take it back because i waited two days past 14-day return policy . so , i sold camera took $100 loss . i'd much rather lose $[ ... ] than keep this camera	-1
this tough because this camera takes beautiful pictures . it takes wonderful video . downloading easy general it " fine " camera . however .... flash it nothing short nightmare . it constantly over exposing every subject . i find it practically un-usable . only way i get image i'm looking lower light setting set iso 800 . if it 1600 iso i wouldn't need flash all practically but it doesn't offer . other thing i don't like i didn't realize i wouldn't like it doesn't it own cradle which charge batteries . batteries removed charged seperately . doesn't sound like big deal but it pain when you think it . batteries lose their charge even when camera isn't which results picking up camera after 2 days realizing it no juice . intensely dissatisfying . this camera also really long delay pushing button taking picture . this results lots closed eyes stupid faces . i know most digitals delay but this one epic . i am getting ready sell this camera buy canon . i am wedding photographer shoot mostly my canon 5d . but since this rated camera year american photo ( publication i trust implicitly ) , i decided stray my canon . bad idea . i'm going right powershot . not pass go . not collect $200 . i reccommend you same .	-1

this scope not good starter scope anyone interested astronomy . here why : 1 . objective too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it too small bring light necessary even beginning look universe . i suppose it adequate moon , but it . planets appear very small disks . one able see saturn rings , but image very small . forget it deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc . 2 . mount altazimuth , which not follow celestial object sky . earth rotating , anyone focusing star or moon quickly find object drifting out field vision . better mount equatorial mount which makes it much easier track objects . 3 . 4mm eyepiece too powerful this scope . observer find it hard look through ( very small eye opening ) , most cases cause blurred images . 20 mm eyepiece only functional eyepiece . barlow 3x , which again too poweerful this scope . 4 . mount vibrate when touched , which cause image eyepiece " shiver " , which very frustrating . even low price , don't enticed this scope ; it too many flaws . save your money larger scope better mount . jim " konedog " koenig , astronomy buf	-1

i bought this item gift , it ended up becoming mine . i say , i am greatly dissatisfied . here some main issues i am camera : 1 . it very poorly designed . look feel camera not elegant . buttons really ugly , operating camera awkward , some functions requires both hands operate .. 2 . camera issues turning off occasionally . 3 . worst , far , picture quality . colors just plain terrible . automatic settings disaster photography . i used canon ( 2mp ) before getting this one ( 5mp ) . canon far superior quality , colors , lighting .. i don't need large files trash , i am perfectly fine smaller files great pictures . result , i am strongly recommending getting different camera . i great experiences canon ; seems like sony nikon doind good job too . but hp must stop making cameras , indeed many other devices .	-1
i loved camera , absolutely loved it . i using it one night it died . i went home put charger nothing happened . light charger didn't flash or camera didn't even go after dying . second time i used it , i just got back vacation put it charger . i able turn it look pictures . i looking pictures , it just shut off . i unable find way turn it back or even shut nose . i would not recommend it this reason unless charger you get different than mine .	-1

i bought this camera like 7 months ago since it so small i liked design .... but pictures it takes suck , specially night time or flash , you barely see what you photographing . video feature its ok even though you cant change zoom while making video , but design doesnt suit well this feature since audio-in exact same place where you suppossed hold camera ... so most my videos dont audio since i blocking audio entrace ... its small portable , i could fit it any pocket , so thats good , but its so small battery lasts only aorund 90 min ... that what it says , but it keep going down like 5times faster than regular min , so it only last like 30 min	-1

add e18 error code complaint list ! i purchased camera year ago , e18 error last 2 months . camera intermitently freeze up not work all , just beep you give you error code e18 . i've tried all recommended fixes compressed air alignment twist . nothing seems keep it functioning more than few shots . canon wants nothing fix , estimates repairs $150 $200 . save headaches , buy camera different manufacturer !	-1
i've this camera just over year ( figures ) it gone completely bonkers me . sometimes it works other times it puts black lines across screen making it useless . you never know when you turn it whether it work or not -- making it completely unreliable . keep mind this camera used almost entirely inside my business , so it wasn't abused , dropped , thrown bottom purse , etc . it treated very carefully probably only shot 2,000 pictures total . frankly , i'm kind glad it broke so i excuse replace it . here why : 1 . takes beautiful still shots , but forget any kind action . it takes too long shots get good action . it also blurs nearly all action shots i've ever taken , regardless what mode it . 2 . red-eye aweful . it should better . i doubt i'll ever buy canon	-1

i start off saying , i loved my sony cybershot . when alpha came out i couldn't wait get one . it died after 200 pictures day three three week once life time trip through south america . amazon said it out their hands because it must returned within 30 days . i've spent 3 hours so far dealing sony . most people i spoke or on-line live chat support unfamiliar product transferred me around business support , computers , video . they also contradicted one . when i get someone who knew product i told firmly despite camera lemon malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they would only ' repair it ' not replace it . now i am stuck lemon , i fear i history further disappointment frustration this camera . i highly recommend you read all customer reviews . other people problems camera , i ignored them because i faith sony thought other alpha owners ' dud cameras unusual . if you decide purchase anyway , i highly recommend you not buy through amazon , but through real store good fair return policy , stands behine their products . places like microcenter exhange , no questions ask . i am kicking myself because amazon $100 cheaper then microcenter . penny wise pound foolish . i love amazon , but , i never buy anything other than books dvds them . lesson learned electronics .	-1
i own several great digital cameras . it seems like i get one each use - one good zoom , camera its good flash use lowlight others . this one i wanted high mp small compact size i put into my pocket . first few photos great , taken outdoors my sunny patio . then every picture i took after ( same settings - fine , hq , poster 10m etc ... vertical lines started showing lcd screen pictures all washed out . when i download them computer , they look exactly way too - lines almost all white . i've played around settings ( i know how work them ) but still it same . so time return find better one . that too bad since i read some good reviews wanted it	-1

i one word argus quick clix , horrible . i bought two these cameras give my daughters christmas . camera lists numerous features what enticed me buy them . i looking inexpensive camera general use . this camera takes horrible pictures . all photos blue tinge them fuzzy . when flash used it so strong there nothing but white out subject . one very irritating feature camera comes flash off . there no way change setting let it come flash . you go through series menus turn it then it takes almost 20 seconds flash get ready use . stated when it finally come you take picture , it so bright picture useless . i would not recommend this camera anyone	-1
sd card worked fine week . problems arise then worsens over time one more week then it just doesn't work anymore . problem not pda , nor software it . tried use card separate flash reader/writer . tried formatting it fat32 , create test directory , data stays less than one hour . i would refrain buying this product .	-1
idea wonderful but window too small useful . i it , pictures it , but never show it anyone . trying find right light illuminate tiny picture ridiculous . easier show few pictures my wallet	-1
downside : 1 . i'll add my complaint several others who same problem . camera suddenly stopped working after nearly 18 months no problems . i switched batteries ... let it set some time without batteries or memory card it ... nothing getting it work . top i now memory card photos it i can't transfer my computer without working camera . 2 . not good indoors pictures especially if you try " night " mode . if you use mode , even tripod , keep your subjects still-lifes , only ... if you photograph people they happen move even slightest , they best blurry , worst they look like double exposures . 3 . indoors pictures set normal mode , or without flash , no better may even worse than your standard cheap 35mm camera . upside : 1 . through its usb cable , it booted right into apple iphoto software making organizing editing photos i took breeze . 2 . outdoors , plenty sunlight , gave me near-perfect pictures got lot praise . kodak well this aspect camera ability , given price . 3 . we won this camera ( free ) so me it almost all upside ... except now i shell out $$$ good camera ( hopefully read my current memory card	-1

worst thing this , you bring bench disc you replace disc every 20 min if you capturing hd video . i think most buyers would take hd video if you buy hd camcorder . but small disc only hold 20 min hd video , change disc time time . cmos sensor worse than ccd but it best sensor among cmos this price today . lot noise come low light condition ! i bought it $800 return it . i think you'd better buy sr1 30g hard drive . would much better one !	-1

this product only display 142 photos no matter how many you may able squeeze onto media card . this little fact isn't mentioned all packaging or manual ( hidden consumer ) . i initially loaded 1,400 photos onto 128mb card shocked only see 142 displayed . firmware upgrade offered manufacturer their website increase this number 250 , but i could never get file load into frame . annoying aspect slideshow plays photos same order everytime you start it same music . it would nice hear random music track start each time frame turned see some later photos instead watch same photos play same order each time you turn frame back . definitely not worth price . shell out couple more bucks something supports unlimited photos allows random playback	-1

i very disappointed nikon service . this camera 2in lcd display apparently very fragile . when i returned service , nikon claimed i dropped it ... which i didn't! i very careful handling this camera , but fragile lcd still broke . blamed manufacturer really disappointing . they offered repair it $210 , nearly price new camera . i never nikon product again . if they going sell such fragile product , they should least include hard case it .	-1
manufacturer apparently states this case compatible panasonic fz1 ( extension fz3 which identical body ) . i bought it report it not compatible fz1 . just lens cap you jam it into bag sideways then wrestle camera get it back out . if you prefer use camera lens hood adapter camera can't fit bag all . there also no padding speak this case . comparison my lowe case my canon eos elan provides secure , padded repository you put camera lens down strap top so camera easily withdrawn again . targus makes decent laptop cases , but they great deal learn camera cases apparently . apparently it fit some cameras , just not panasonic fzs . considering product made china one should able expect bit more this price	-1
i spent couple hours , trying get transfer dv my camcorder my mac powerbook . after hours hours i realize usb cable delivered sony camcorder absolutely worthless . if you don't own sony vaio ( which my opinion just overdesigned peace fancy 007 gear i . link connection , which no other pc/mac has)your getting frustrated pretty quick . i would given cable 5 star rating , but way i get cable , buy it seperately , big rip off . however i found exact same cable apple store called " thin fire wire " . exact same cable ( 1.8 meter 4 6 pin exact ) only $29 it works just fine . so check out apple store near you save some money . shame you sony	-1
i bought my kodak v570 less than year ago . first only annoyance i fact i use attachment transfer pictures video mov format made it diffcult edit . but few months ago , focus refused work properly . wide angle , it fine but when i zoomed , image unacceptably blur . i tried every setting , finally gave up called kodak service . i asked mail camera sydney melbourne where i live . few weeks later , camera returns note there noting wrong it . since i still could not take acceptable pictures , i contacted them again . this time told send pictures via e-mail . i my surprise answer poor lighting caused shutter speed slow down hence blur images . but pictures taken broad daylight . when i disagreed logic comment , i told call them discussion over phone . but number they gave me fax number . using my resources , i got touch technical service phone . this time i told try using tripod if pictures come out alright , it probably due shaky hands ! it though they people tech support who never owned camera who never taken pictures before their lives . it so frustrating thinking damage camera my recent india trip when many pictures turned out blur . now i put up illogical incompetent service people . there no way i ever buy kodak again . i recommend it only my worst enemies . i now , again , send camera troubleshooting going level service so far , i am not holding my breath answers . still want buy kodak ? go ahead but don't say i not warn you . way , my other camera casio it works beautifully shaky hands or not	-1

i purchased this digital picture frame after doing my homework , reading all reviews i could different kinds . one i purchased flawed , would take 5 or 6 tries inserting memory card before i could get it boot up . when it running i very disappointed quality pictures . what description this product not tell you - frame not come usb cable- so it not hook up computer . this means you must either all pics you want display already memory card your camera , or you must have/purchase card reader download pics your computer your camera card . ( side note - if you sony digital camera , memory sticks not allow you back any pics onto them your computer not taken their format - so forget using pics someone else sent , you took camera , or you reformatted photo program ) . i went digital pic frame brookstone instead - far better quality , much more user friendly	-1

theory , this camera perfect . fits into your pocket . video quality definately good considering it records compressed format mpeg-4 . pictures good if you know how finesse it . perfect all around anytime camrea , right ? here thing . i got camera mainly video . i just daughter wanted something those candid moments i could always me . also , i not want minidv because uploading computer real time . i wanted sd card film , even if it would sacrfice some video quality . but thing ruins this camera me mic picks up lens motor/ auotfocus nosie . playback i cearly hear zooming zooming out every time lens focuses . it sounds like someone smoking hooka . get this , it even says so instruction manual , page 35 , " caution during video clip playback , sound motor audible .... during recording , sound optical zoom movement or autofocus movement recorded . this not malfunction . " awful . way , take picture while recording video function worthless . it leaves pause your video image while sound keeps recording , still image captured usually blury . whats point anyway , i think camera built function extract still video . or you it whatever editing software you use . oh , one last thing . i keep still camera sports mode get clean pic . my hand shakes too much . there digital stabalization video , but no optical stabilization stills . its big shame , too . camera very cool . if not audible motor noise , i would given this least 8/10 . but lens motor noise unacceptable ! ps . all cameras today should built lens cover . this one cheap plastic one , you'll probably lose	-1

i recommend not purchase this item . look one . lens itself seems ok , although i can't really say , but adapter which built lens shoddy cumbersome ruins whole deal . adapter quick release type where one end attaches camera lens simply snaps , or quickly released . this would great , except two very important things . one , lens fits very loosely quick release adapter . this causes some major distortion , especially when moving . two , housing made thin plastic which not seem very durable . fact it so cheaply thin i am afraid leave it my car because heat may distort plastic . one drop , even small one , it	-1

this awesome little camera . except you can't use it night ! there horrible white spots nighttime photos when flash used . apparently these appear because flash so close lens this camera , so dust reflects badly . it known problem [ ... ] also , it totally annoying sony uses all their proprietary technology . result , cable connecting this camera computer unwieldly ( uhh , you heard usb ??!! ) , you buy sony memory stick , which probably won't work anything else you . flipside , you take movies aren't limited 30 seconds this guy - i think might result memory stick technology . but other than , design operation this little guy seems pretty slick . lens not one those pops out , so not sure if affects image quality all , but far i could tell , quality good . end , what good camera can't take usable pictures its flash ??	-1

some digital cameras no viewfinder all , but nikon 8400 " electronic viewfinder " reviews good price great , so i bought camera . electronic viewfinder turns out too dark see face person you trying photograph indoors flash , you cannot see any expressions , just outline person head , so you guess shoot several times then see photos you just shot viewfinder . outdoors you cannot see enough detail viewfinder know what you including your shot . " display " lcd monitor small washes out sunligh t.t he background flash shots unacceptably dark . after 3 days use 90 shots i mailed it back " ritz amazon " this morning , dec 5 . they require it back " within 10 days receipt purchase " , their " date order " nov 29 it arrived my house dec 3 . it good thing i already compact flash card use , there not one box if i waited one i ordered arrive , well , it not here yet . it cost me $11.65 return it , insured , 2 day delivery " delivery confirmation receipt " . camera some strengths well it weaknesses , but only short time try it out before " 10 days " ran out serious difficulty trying see what i shooting i gave up it	-1
i ordered two items above error . i not think first order submitted properly so therefore second one ordered came antonline . i trying since dec . 19 return wide angle lens adapter them . i am 71 years old not computer savvy . i just wish i could get return labels my account credited . they still original packing received never opened . thank you interested . i informed them my time expired . i not believe this true , or your opening web page not apply them .	-1
if you want quality product , this ain't it . dreaded " remove cassette " error true full force . don't take my word it , search net find hundreds , upon thousands unhappy consumers who purchased this piece junk discovered it hard way . i highly suggest panasonic ag-dvx100 . it costs bit more , but well worth it . before reading other reviews , make sure they comparing gl-2 cam , like tony . shores . he compares canon gl-piece-of-junk-2 sony hdr-fx1 . sure , sony much better , but it also high-definition cam . if you want hd , check out panasonic ag-hvx200 . your research , read reviews	-1
i bought this item gift , it ended up becoming mine . i say , i am greatly dissatisfied . here some main issues i am camera : 1 . it very poorly designed . look feel camera not elegant . buttons really ugly , operating camera awkward , some functions requires both hands operate .. 2 . camera issues turning off occasionally . 3 . worst , far , picture quality . colors just plain terrible . automatic settings disaster photography . i used canon ( 2mp ) before getting this one ( 5mp ) . canon far superior quality , colors , lighting .. i don't need large files trash , i am perfectly fine smaller files great pictures . result , i am strongly recommending getting different camera . i great experiences canon ; seems like sony nikon doind good job too . but hp must stop making cameras , indeed many other devices .	-1

i attracted cannon zr800 due very small size very low cost . however , you get what you pay , although you get much more other brands just little increase cost . i've already returned my cannon zr800 replaced it sony dcr-hc38 . smallest problem canon continued motor noise , which you should aware it if you read any review any zr800 predecessors . problem motor very loud , you hear very annoying whirr if you indoors . this could forgivable given low cost , but problem zoom noise not . when you zoom out , very noticable clicking noise occurs when you let go zoom switch . it loud click when you play back your video this click amplified your video . it impossible watch video not notice this click . it annoying , unusual big flaw these new zr cannon camcorders . i called technical support , person took zr800 tried it out then acknowledged problem exist ( she seemed stunned this noise occuring ) . bottom line , this camcorder absolutely unusable due this clicking noise would not worth using even if it free . not but it . btw , i love sony dch-hc38 which bit more expensive , like zr800 , just recently came onto market .	-1
i can't say sure my experience typical , but i say it horrible . short version : i return it once screen failure , then i return replacement screen failure ( refund ) . returns , i spent significant amount time phone customer support . manual inadequate , especially wireless stuff . i also problems windows ( network bridging , i think ) further complicated things . brief time two units worked , i pleased . picture quality good , once running , i no problems software . i take lot digital photos . this would perfect compliment . i gave memory frame two stars ( instead one ) because , failures configuration problems , i pleased quality display . too bad i couldn't say same quality control .	-1

i bought this camera my 4yr old granddaughter who handle my digital camera quite well found it total waste . camera much smaller than expected , trying figure out what mode you're ridiculous display quite difficult see let alone interpret . nothing simple " one step " procedure which you would expect item geared towards children . i so frustrated setting it up i didn't bother giving it her . software installed okay but also far " kid friendly " . i wish i would've found read these user opinions before making purchase . ironically , reviews i see made it out better than other cameras market kids . i believe you'd better off purchasing " regular " inexpensive digital camera your potential " shutterbugs " .	-1
this camera waste money should taken off market . after purchase we never able retreive pictures . computer would recognize camera but stated no pictures available download . it not only difficult use but not even adult could figure out how take picture this product made child . instructions complicated eventually you give up . even putting batteries complicated you need screwdriver ( smallest one you find ) achieve it . unfortunately , i wasted my money but luckily you don't	-1
overall , i entirely disappointed this camaera . packaging description deceiving . there no view finding screen , only teeny , tiny window regular camera . this gift child who would just much fun throw away camera . i bought it because i wanted give her digital large view finding screen . construction would not hold up single drop ground . i would not recommend this anyone	-1

panasonic very compact , very stylish sexy my wife called it , but photos very disappointing : they way noisy ! even if set lowest asa setting 80asa it just barely acceptable they get progressively worse anything above 100asa . colours good , it take very good videos , but still photos just plain bad when compared other cameras photoshop cs2 . course it easy understand why : native resolution images . if one investigates such things , notice panasonic only 72 dpi , same sony , canon improves this 180 , nikon 300 dpi . it not just megapixels folks , but how those megapixels recorded what resolution . obviously camera 72 dpi more noise than one 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking upgrading newer model , yourself favour . try 4 or 5 cameras same megapixel range good camera store taking photos same subject same light condition . set camera lowest asa highest picture quality jpg format , take photos , pop sd card into computer , compare images photoshop . enlarge full pixel size ( 100%) , look meta data same time you see yourself . what i , since i not very happy images my panasonic produced ! i this camera 11 months 20 days exactly , today i traded it nikon p5000 after evaluating over dozen models including leica d-lux3 10mp camera , driving sales persons crazy all testing spending 4 hours store , but it very educational them too	-1

i spend hours pouring over reviews trying decide which ultracompact best deal best overall camera . end , it came down panasonic fx01 cannon sd600 . i read warnings other reviewers panasonic images weren't top quality , but i chose ignore those reviewers because paper fx01 looks like it would out perform sd600 . i wrong . after using fx01 few days i knew what those other reviewers talking - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera great , but it just wasn't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera amazon ( very easy-great service ) because poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs why you take photos , right ? i know someone sd600 he very happy quality . judging customer images sd600 page amazon , i think i should've gone cannon	-1

owner sony dcr-hc30 model dv handicam , i want warn everyone my horrible experience this product line . design feature-wise , these handicams great . problem , they built like junk . day i opened my box , i got message told me heads dirty needed cleaned . retrospect , i should returned it replacement then there . but basically optimistic guy , i decided it just got dirty transit , i got head cleaner cleaned heads . it worked fine 30 days - just amount time sony crappy labor warranty . point forward , i gotten dirty head messages constantly , which first could `cleaned away , ' but now , even when message gone , problems persist . i often get bars across screen during playback , i already determined i lost many precious memory my infant children . sony solution this situation their standard " flat rate " repair program , truly bargain $250 or so - more than half what i paid camera first place . sony wonders why their brand value all but disappeared ? they just electronics brand now , one sub-par quality service . guess i'll buying samsungs or canons next time around . you listening , sony ?	-1

i bought this lens my canon powershot g5 , because it requires use long adapter , not only it cause terrible vignetting ( circle other poster thought cool , but which actually design flaw ) unless you zoom most way , it blocks built-in flash . i owned four canon cameras over past 15 years , g5 everything related it huge disappointment . ( i would bought digital rebel when it first came out so i could use my eos lenses , but it didn't allow flash exposure compensation ( insane $1000 camera body ) . ) i not recommend this lens or any g-series digital cameras canon . when i've got money i'll buying latest digital rebel upgrading some my old eos lenses , selling my entire powershot kit . if you experienced photographer , you not like this system all	-1
i feel it just way too much money what you get . i own lot professional ( canon ) equipment gladly paid price because they best things out there . but it makes little sense market marginal product still expect command high price . i s80 . no complaint there . leather case just way too tight , which invites fumble you try pull out camera . flap issue issue . neck chain bit short , similar better items lower price . if you shop around you also find li battery less . i'm not upset , but just disappointed what i got price	-1

if you going lay out $500 camera , you should expect fair amount camera . however , i few gripes here . first , there no remote control it which makes setting up shot tough . all nikons series use wireless remote . you buy underwater case those magnificent nikons so you shoot underwater . you get over 10 megapixels d80 , or d200 you get great nikkor lens . you don't get much lens dc500 , 5 megapixels don't get you very far when it comes printing publication quality images . lets face it : this expensive point-n-shoot camera tourist , not serious camera . nuff said . -	-1
sure my canon sd-30 super cute i get lots compliments how small sexy it , but heaven forbid you want take pictures it !! this camera cannot take pictures low light all ! every picture i've taken parties out focus , which adds up lot hazy photos great memories . i took it back camera shop guy said i setting right but " yeah , they don't work well low light . " well if i needed bright sunny day every shot i could make pinhole camera out cardboard box ! pictures it takes daylight nice . but anyone who wants tiny little camera like this planning putting it their pocket taking it parties ! i got sony cybershot 10.1 it takes great pictures low light . later , canon .	-1

i recently bought this lens amid trepidation 85mm focal length would overwhelm 1.6 crop factor my digital rebel xl . my worries needless : just step or two back subject plus some getting used telephoto perspective enough turn this lens into most effective portrait lens i . when attached my eos elan 7n film camera , however , lens really truly comes into its own , full frame 35mm slr delivers entire focal range this lens . focused image incredibly crisp compared any other non-l grade lens . i agree this lens deserves red ring courage around it , like lenses . this glass absolutely essential very short list affordable lenses , should give many non-affordable ones run their money . solidly built too , old-fashioned no-nonsense look it . i highly recommend it	1
i enjoy tc80n3 . you may think it costly , but features out standing . i think it worth buy . only disappointment i there no " , off " power switch	1
this very powerful flash unit works master other canon flash units . you get very nice results small amount experimentation . it what it suppose . i used it 420ex i've several years it worked fine . mounted camera it larger version built popup 30d some extra niceties lots more power . thinking 430ex ? cough up few extra bucks this baby , you'll glad you . it one shot deal , [ no pun intended ] , you'll using it years come . i bought 420ex my elan ii 6 years ago . it great unit . this one recharges faster gobs more power . you'll love it ! don't let all dials switches scare you , read instruction manual	1
i use this little gadget mainly macro portrait work . when you it light emitting flash diffused which gives you more flattering less contrasty light illuminate your subjects . unless you going very shadowy , high-contrast , image this diffuser save day . it very light weight easy pack small places , so you should never good reason leave it behind . sometimes it simple things make biggest difference photo , using this defiantly make very noticeable differences	1
when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
i gone old 640x480 nine years ago 3.1 last few years canon 20d now , what pleasure shot . battery life not issue even over 250 shots , which should sufficient most anybody . there small learning curve but you would expect this any new camera . lens choice great idea which came earlier review excellent walk around ability this lens general shots closeups those favorite flowers . those individuals who fence this product i tout it all i spoken . it turned good photo experience our west coast road trip into real serious photo shoot , it also uses commonly accessable compact flash . built flash works well not explore options this time . delivery this item when promised nice bow package	1
i shoot canon 20d used canon ef 75-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 iii usm lens . i've always noticed limitations this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed lens lineup canon website decided canon ef 100-400mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 usm lens . 100-400mm great lens , but it bit soft . reason i decided add canon ef 70-200mm 2.8 /f usm telephoto zoom lens my lens collection . this serious lens meant serious photographers . lens , there lot features manufactured better materials high level dust moisture resistance . construction sturdy consists 23 elements 18 groups . four super ud-glass elements largely eliminate secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration . improved 8-blade circular aperture offers more pleasing out-of-focus image . canon ef 70-200mm lens weighs 3.24 lbs/ 1,470 , accepts 77mm filters minimal focusing distance 4.3 ft/ 1.3 . this lens compatible extenders 1.4 ii 2x ii . sure get good quality uv haze filter protect front lens element . white , this lens looks bit strange , but helps keep it stay cool when shooting sun . some people concerned white , it attracts attention criminals . my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless what lens i put it . addition , i most likely camera bag tripod/monopod me further attract attention . i personally doubt thief looking something steal taking time evaluate cost item more concerned ease taking something they unload . i try make things difficult would thieves insurance back up . dual system two modes . mode 1 stationary subjects while mode two moving subjects . it recommended function not used tripod ; however i used it my monopod success . helps eliminate camera shake helps stabilize lens when shooting moving vehicle . while there limitations what , it give you few extra stops . just keep mind , attempts eliminate camera movement , not movement subject photographed . this lens permits auto or manual focus depending how switch set . there also switch shift 1.4 m/ 4.6 ft infinity or 2.5 m/ 8.2 ft infinity . included this lens tripod mount , lens hood , storage case . tripod mount best option use when mounting tripod . this helps balance load . mounting camera instead creates unbalanced set up may topple over . case zippered soft case ( lz1324 ) also purchased separately . lens hood ( et-86 ) used reduce lens flare protect front element certain situations . often times , amazon recommends purchasing lens case hood , however they normally included lens . canon ef 70-200mm such awesome lens , it almost fails compare canon ef 75-300mm . canon 100-400mm lens well used option me , but clarity sharpness 70-200mm lens more refined . auto-focus quiet quick . this lens used portraits , landscape , sports or general walk lens . f/ 2.8 combined makes this good option certain low light situations . features add creative versatility . canon ef 70-200mm lens comes price , but it worth every bit it . pros : incredible clarity sharpness quiet quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual system cons : heavy bulky ( this should expected these types lenses	1
i bought this lens whim see what it would like shoot prime lens . $80 it certainly worth risk unlike many other canon lenses which cost thousands dollars . quality pictures this lens only thing making me move away zoom lenses	1

hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shaped offers limited protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . shallow petal shaped , this type protection also limited . even if protection limited , replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing lens easier replace . this hood manufactured canon 28-135mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 ef normally not included lens when sold new . amazon often suggests purchasing one your lens , worth considering . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . this lens itself isn't unusually wide so extra inch may not problem . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality reduces lens flare problems offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store lens	1
this wonderful bag photographer wants light weight bag still hold lot lenses or bodies . bag slings around front allowing user easily switch out lenses without unload entire bag or worry dropping expensive lense . also , bag hold lot accessories . i canon rebel xt bodies 3 lenses just camera compartment . flap opens up user when bag your chest memory card holder , but it hold 8 memory cards which huge ! top small pouch where you tuck away larger objects like water bottle or map . all weather bag cover built into bag so you not worry folding it up storing it . bag cover also velcro pulls latches it onto bag so it stays insuring dry environment inside bag . basically this top notch bag get through anything . yes , i actually used bag few trips find it very user friendy reasonable	1
my all-around favorite lens canon eos system 50/ 1.4 . i find most time , most pictures i want take achieved using hte 50mm focal length , fast aperture allows me take photos low light . i bought 24-70/ 2.8 hopes getting high quality images zoom lens , lot my pictures weren't particularly dark places , flexibility get little wider or closer sounded appealing . i not disappointed . image quality produced 24-70/ 2.8 outstanding . great color , great sharpness . it might not make images quite striking canon 135/2 lens , but they very good indeed . this lens replace 50/ 1.4 ? no way . 50 lot smaller , weighs lot less , still much better low light shooting . but photographing events where you don't want lug around several prime lenses or go extreme lenghts frame shot better , 24-70 great tool	1
i purchased this photographic store because professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4 . just keep mind -- 1.4 only " 40% better " . it worked really well , but didn't increase zoomage enough . i decided go 2x ( that twice zoomage ) teleconverter kenko instead . i gave this one my brother-in-law christmas . you think what you want -- i want get really close birds . i 70-300mm zoom lens 1.4 takes it 98-420mm . it improvement , but not nearly enough ! if you want get twice close , this isn't going it you . if you want get half-again-as close , this almost gets you there . far quality , quality definitely there . five stars quality , 3 insufficient zoomage	1
it good my title says , however , i found one con it there no place i put string it so i put it my pocket when i take it off	1
this camera potential pictures amazing clarity colors but not straight out camera . i too disappointed after converting raw files c1 pro acr . it possible my d-rebel would better than this monster gives me neck pains made my right arm start looking like swartzenegger arm ? even glass results dissapointing . problem not camera but workflow . after using it 2 months i am getting used workflow give me results i am looking . i realize this camera not perform any processing enhancements camera because pros need it themselves . once i got over fact i would sharpen saturate colors lot more than before i content never touched d-rebel ever since . ps beware severe neck pains when attaching any zoom lens . buy hand strap or better neck strap . some photo samples found here : http://www.trekearth.com/members/nbournas/photos	1
i gave this monopod my boyfriend , gift , it perfect his use . he videotapes his kids baseball softball games , tired holding camcorder so long . he didn't want deal bulky tripod when he getting up down , so monopod seemed like great idea . he loved it !! he says it keeps camera very steady it very easy change height so he use it sitting or standing . he no professional , but he uses his camcorder lot , he'll happily using monopod long time	1
my cousin wife professional studio photographer who occasionally lends out her lenses me clothing / lifestyle photoshoots ( i've pretty active this area some time , just now starting go full digital ) , i've used f/ 2.8 four or five times this one best lenses i've used . period . shooting wide open allows you retain high shutter speeds night shots , well get very interesting vibrant long shutter shots ( crowds , freeway night , etc ) . when shooting action shots , tripod mount get way zooming focusing , but it removed easily enough . i personally just purchased f/ 4.0 , which , coupled relatively wide max aperture shooting either 1600 or 3200 my 20d , should nicely , but i still rate 2.8 high up my list	1
balance grip really much better . yes i am aware there problems some earlier ones , but mine seems just fine ( knocking wood i type )	1
i recently purchased this use my 550ex . if you use alot flash event photography , you want this your kit . it expensive , but i think it worth every penny . it keep you changing aas your strobe it quickens recycle times nearly instant . you shoot bursts still get proper flash exposure . you attach strap sling it over your shoulder or slip it your belt . mounting my 20d just not comfortable . it gets way hand-grip	1
this great lens any user , professional or amateur . this lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive/clean results . slight distortion noticeable when shooting 10mm ( 16mm cropped ) but this easily correctable software . addition , very fast absolutely silent usm huge plus . i highly recommend this lens anyone wanting great landscapes or great door/architecture shots ( especially realtors )	1
if you don't need speed or can't afford expensive 85mm 1.4 nikkor lens or both , then this lens may right one you . it took nikon while produce superb compact 85mm lens , but this time they finally got it right . without doubt , this fine portrait lens photographing head-and-shoulder portraits ( only lens which optically better nikon legendary 105mm 2.5 nikkor lens , its close optical twin , 105mm 2.8 micro nikkor . ) . since 105mm 2.5 nikkor lens doesn't autofocus version , then this might perfect moderate telephoto lens owners nikon autofocus slr cameras . regardless , this lens well-earned reputation excellent contrast resolution	1
i bought this lens go my canon digital rebel xt . i absolutely love this lens . i got it try some insect other macro shots it served this purpose very well . some practice this lens produce fantastic macros some great bokeh boot . i read other reviews must say i never scared insect away noise mentioned before . i taken countless insect shots this lens . it bit louder than other lenses i but i don't see it problem . one problem i encounter when using autofocus busy closeup scene it often focus background instead say closer insect flower . when this happens i just flip it manual focus way . no big deal . overall , great lens even greater price . definitely worth it . ( i submitted photo bee i took couple days ago this lens example . )	1
i bought this hood after reading elsewhere it fits 50mm f/ 1.8 mark i ( version metal mount distance scale ) i purchased recently . canon specs discontinued es-65 hood this lens . great thing this et-65iii it longer , so it blocks more stray light without vignetting full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs . interior this mark iii version also flocked , providing bit more light absorption . i've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while college , but this hood definitely worth investment : well built , fits backward lens storage ( but too long while lens camera ) , provides good protection front lens ( it quite deep ) . note this not fit newer 50mm f/ 1.8 mark ii version ( all plastic mount no distance scale )	1
hi rebel extreme , needed use high-speed mode ... but flash couldn't even vaguely keep up . i taking pictures dancers , so needed flash system could keep up . speedlite really this perfectly - i'm able take rapid-fire sequence photos , this flash system there each time . i don't know if it really helps when taking single photo , but if you want flash keep up , this one great ! i like it so much , i'm planning buying one or two more my next shoot , run slave mode this one .	1
i cannot help but giggle when i saw comments like " great lens money " . it selling $440 here , even so-called clearance . however , one easily find same lens least $50 cheaper some decent online camera store , such bh , ritz camera , etc . sad amazon ..	1
i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camea , its beyond description ...	1
when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i'd always loyal film . digital could never take place film . i'm not convinced it replaced film completely . there still something i love putting roll film camera , shooting away , sending film processed , seeing results . i also know it bit expensive . i know argument quality always paramount discussion , but digital cameras improving this regard , most manufacturers assuring users while technology always improving , we point where good investment made digital slr it not outdated soon buyer purchases camera . so i figured now time get digital slr . i loyal nikon user nearly ten years , owned nikon n60 , n70 , n80 . my first love , still n70 ( i've told person who sold me camera he thought i only person who loved n70 ) . i purchased n80 only after my n70 cost too much repair , but i've enjoyed way my various nikon cameras handled all sorts situations fact they simple use point shoot if i don't time use specific controls , but it also options more creative artistic purposes . my nikon cameras allowed me capture family moments ease majestic landscapes , wildlife shots all sorts other things i can't resist capture forever . i decided purchase d70 since it close what i've already experienced nikon . many ways it works similar way n70 80 , except it digital rather than film version . like film versions midrange nikon slr , it dial allows automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , night portrait modes , ability select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . camera auto manual focus abilities . photos easy or technical photographer desires . controls easy use , though it takes practice comfortable . personal level , camera passed halloween test , niece birthday test , fall foliage new england test favorite scenic spots test . only real difficulty i've camera trying capture stained glass windows dark setting . auto focus not worked all i'm not thrilled manual focus these shots , but this point i'm sure it photographer not camera . i one suggestion anyone who purchases this camera . manual very confusing . it uses all sorts symbols more distraction than anything else . i've luck " magic lantern guides " my other cameras , but not yet used it this camera . i purchase nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which helpful . it quick reference anyone already familiar nikon photography general but it also provides introduction novice photography .	1
i switched digital rebel xt . since i already l-glass lenses , i didn't run into problems 5d " exposing " cheaper lenses . 17-40mm really shines full sensor ! burst rate simply astonishing . missing flash doesn't bother me , heck it $3000 camera , i don't expect built-in flash . i speedlite 580ex , which course wonderful itself . i also battery grip which i recommend , well rs-80n3 cable release . image quality superb overall - 5d really shines high iso numbers - more so than even 1d what i've read . even 1600 there hardly any noise . it allows you take great , crisp photos low light where other cameras would require flash . camera also quite light while very sturdy same time . 3 fps might bother some , but i prefer incredible burst numbers .	1
it everything it reported . it works very well . we take it every trip we take	1
i received my 28-200 yesterday amazon . read customer reviews , i immediately put my rebel xt tripod ran two series comparison shots 28-200 my canon 28-135 . three shots each f-stops 5.6 , 11 , 20 , one set indoors iso 1600 other outdoors iso 200 . focal length 135 using same scenes each camera , highest jpeg setting . after shooting both series , i compared them fresh out camera , side side . results : 28-200 least sharp 28-135 both foreground background most instances . it visibly sharper iso 200 f-stops 5.6 20 , ( 28-135 took honors f-stop 10 ) , 20 , it visibly sharper both foreground background . 28-135 one-stop faster shutterwise . both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely photoshop . there vagaries autofocus different shooting conditions consider ; different test scenes conceivably produce different results . my conservative conclusion : 28-200 good it gets super-zoom your canon ( unless you going drop $2200 series 28-300 carry it ) , 28-135 no clear sharpness advantage . these lenses , its tradeoff --- extra 65 mm focal length ( 105 mm after 1.6 conversion ) versus image stabilization low-light shooting capability . both lenses focus quickly silently , both lenses produce usable shots .	1
my sony dscw100 camera small but very functional user friendly , it makes photography easy interesting hobby .	1
it pretty convinient bag . i put canon rebel xt tamron 28-75 lens , canon 70-300 lens external flash inside i still small pocket wallet , keys etc . only drawback this bag , you not put big lenses . canon 70-300 limit . but if you only limited gear collection , you need give it try	1
this excellent device . quick respond my d80 . i use it take family pictures include me . i just point press this remote activate d80 timer it works beautifully	1
i not actually taken this underwater yet , but it appears well made similar quality other cases . it keeps theover-all size camera/case down size could fit into bc pocket . downside , it only limited functionality camera through available buttons . you zoom telephoto , change camera , playback movie mode shoot picture . you cannot any setup functions while it case . regarding stobe , sony makes one looks little cheezy . there " universal " strobe sea life ( sl 960d ) fits , but fiber-optic trigger just taped onto flash camera . i'm waiting how this works . one replacement o-ring comes case-replacements sony outrageously expensive . color-correcting ( red ) lenses $100 sony , but not needed if you use strobe . ( unless maybe shoot movies ? )	1
i am certainly happy i bought this filter kit . starting photographer , price right , i not noticed any quality issues . uv filter stays lens all times , it cheaper replace filter , than it scratched lens element repaired . light polarizer very handy , also works very well , cutting down greatly glare . i not yet occasion use warming filter yet . filter case nice extra , it fits right my camera bag , out way untill i need it	1
well , i've my rebel xti 6weeks now , all i say wow !!! i rebel xt , which awesome camera . i'm not professional , but i take pictures what ever it may outside or inside , youth or adult events hobby . this camera not person who wants just point shoot or camera stuff your pocket . this camera creative person who wants control pictures they taking . sensor cleaner wide lcd just few wonderful advances xt xti . camera me easy use takes great pictures auto mode or my mode . i hope this helps you your decision whether buy or not .	1
i just bought digital rebel month ago . love camera , my old 380ex speedlight integrates camera but just doesn't offer enough cycle speed keep up continuous mode rebel . this flash job rebel plug external battery pack promises even better performance once i grab item . big selling point really makes this unit worth cash , it its own infrared focus assist lamp which digital rebel lacks . when this flash mounted your digital rebel , you don't get annoying set quick flashes camera set off focus low light when using built-in flash . rebel body uses infrared focus assist 550ex focus lens ; this feature alone worth big bucks this baby costs . flash tons features most us might never use , but advanced amateur i'm glad they're there so i play if i should choose try out some fancy stuff . wireless slave capability handy but you've got least one more 420ex , 550ex or 580ex use . i like digital readout back flash also two way bounce head , it important note you press button make head turn either side side or up/down --- this should make head sturdier than i've seen some units get loose after awhile drive you nuts . this unit honker -- really big , , no lightweight either . get yourself big deep camera bag if you want lug this thing around you . what difference this 580ex ? 580 very slightly faster cycle times offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes , me anyway it wasn't worth almost two hundred dollars more 580 . all newer eos camera bodies fully supported this unit , it also works older eos bodies but there functions available newer ones aren't there older stuff . i like this flash it covers well , cycles fast controls fairly intuitive easy use . when you get yours don't lose book , canon doesn't seem them online anywhere i find i've seen places want charge you 18 bucks new one	1
im graphic design student college , so i really needed camera . i decided this one i am really glad i . pictures nice clean . camera itslef very sleek looking one very compact . only downfall this it eats batteries pretty quick , but i just took them out when i wasnt using them . buy this camera	1
this one first lenses i purchased my rebel xt . now after taking several thousand pictures it i honestly say it well worth cost . i very rarely any unsharp pictures this lens unless it my own fault trying use too slow shutter speed without tripod . i also 180mm f/ 3.5 macro lens , which costs 3 times more than this lens , although it very clear extra reach nice times especially since it used both 1.4 2x tc , it very difficult use inside without tripod . 60mm handheld if needed very good results even if you bump your iso up little so . i also used this lens both inside outside portrait work very nice results . all-in-all , given it small size light weight i very rarely leave this lens behind when i go out because you never know when you might see great macro shot	1
i took this me recently australia shot landscapes well others , pictures came out better than film cameras i used recently , plus you don't need scanner . this camera works great , must semi-pros . pros , wait new 1d . pictures come out great 11quot ; x17quot ;	1

this just plain sweetheart lens . it covers useful 18-35 mm range ( which 27-52mm nikon digital slr , which very useful range ) . this lens costs less than half price ( expensive ) professional nikon 17-35 , almost nice job . sufficiently nice , fact , most amateurs not discern much , if any , difference . while not built like tank , i think quality construction this one excellent , more than adequate enthusiastic amateurs even some pros . nikon digital slr , which use center portion this lens ( due size sensor slr ) you expect excellent , even spectacular results . this fabulous lens landscape nature shots , portraits , or just plain walking around taking pictures . someone who only wanted one lens not telephoto could much worse than select this excellent , versatile lens . this one great parties , vacations , works . images i shot this lens all featured superb contrast , very sharp , beautiful color rendition . there just not lot not like this lens . i give it 4 stars overall performance , but 5 stars value price/performance . some lenses just get it all together work become keepers . this one those	1
easily snaps place job . considerably less expensive than local retail outlet - delivery quick well	1
i wish i'd bought this loooong time ago ! it so helpful , esp . macro shots . highly recommend	1
this elegant leather case canon elph cameras . it fits pocket easily . i'm satisfied	1
though lenses my nikon d50 not expensive some they still several hundred dollars this uv protection filter protecting lens glass made whole lot sense . i feel less stress when i clean filter lens than if i wiping dust dirt actual lens glass . this size , 52mm , what specified my d50 it fits perfectly , it should . i no complaints all manufacturer or seller . if you new digital slr like i then get this filter protect your lens . spend your time worrying sensor when you need switch out your lens .	1
i not repeat what other reviews stated already , all reviews below pretty much correct this camera high quality easy use etc etc . only issue focusing small target such name brand logo inside rolex watch . it hard even manual mode ( i actually alot digital camera experience ) . forget trying focus auto mode , it won't happen .. least not without alot tinkering stress . if you need take alot close up pictures small detailed items ( jewelery , insects , etc . ) then i recommend buying digital slr camera , nikon d50 good one ! this fuji you looking here perfect taking pictures normal things like people , cars , buildings , sites , etc	1

i needed lens hood my 50mm lens paying $25 hood $75 lens might seem ridiculous . however , might because $75 lens so inexpensive . if lens $250 then paying extra 10% might not seem too bad . i just saw total cost lens hood $100 that good terrific prime lens its hood . however , please note : lens hood rather shallow ( 1 star reduction ) it screw-on two piece kit ( 1 star reduction ) . one piece adaptor screws-on where filters normally go ( uv filter ) front lens intended permanent integral part lens second piece hood snaps off this adaptor . adaptor ring retains same 52mm rim size so your protective filter go before or after adaptor . ( 1 bonus star ) because $100 still bargain 50mm , 1.8 , super fast , super sharp , super clear , light weight beginner lens hood kit ! i hope this helps rather than confuse . :)	1
i working major daily newspaper baltimore 2 decades . perhaps qualify me expert photography . i shooting digital imagery since late 1990s . maybe qualifies me expert digital photography . this may long- winded , but it extensive useful . i received nikon d2h camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago . i think i got them shortly after d2h system released 2003 . since then , i used them shoot images all types -- documentary , sports , daytime , available light , flash , dead- of- night -- paper i work . this only camera i work . first , please read manual . there ton information there , information terrific begin . d2h highly- configurable , screen after screen you set your own specific use ( resist lending camera anyone long period time , your camera may returned many your settings changed so much it acts like thoroughly different camera ) . i'll just punch right way it feels . camera rather heavy beast , some , there amount shoulder or neck fatigue when using it hours per day , like i . but camera feels well hand controls easy move through . i've long since given up using any camera bag . all i fanny pack 14mm , 55mm , teleconverters 2 extra camera batteries flashes clipped its belt . d2h hold 17-35mm nikon 80-200mm nikon one- touch or sigma 120-300mm 2- touch . shooting breeze . batteries let you shoot long before need recharge . i my d2h set iso 200 or 400 most time sacrifice shutter speed lower iso often i , because higher isos bring digital noise loss color saturation . just today , i purchased digital noise plug ins photoshop limit this , that wonderful thing invest this camera when you must shoot action photography no flash iso 800 above . i now little problems capturing images even barely- limited lighting . i recently shot stars plane wing my seat airbus 36,000 feet over pacific 30 seconds wide open @ f/ 2.8 , it looks tons better than night shots via d1h , which lacked internal digital noise filter . filter kicks around 1/2 second longer exposures , make you wait long your image you've shot strip your long exposure much digital noise . when you shoot this way ( general ) , don't simply react cranking up iso because you not happy your results . camera loud . over 7 frames per second , it make you obvious quiet room . shooting sensitive situations testy , so limit your shooting single frames . i wish this camera option silence this camera , but since mirror raise lower , there no chance this . am i happy d2h ? definitely , yes . there improvements made ? yes . but benefits outweigh drawbacks . people bailing out using nikon system going canon , which some incredible gear , i won't deny . but instead simply giving up your system equipment , learn how use d2h well you'll much happier than ever . means you should push its qualities max while respecting its limitations . instance , white balance . this best thing you , or worst thing you've ever dealt , depending upon how you approach it . daylight , grey skies , dusk dawn easy , because you set camera daylight , flash , shadow ( dusk dawn times ) even fluorescent incandescent tend right ballpark . but horrible mixed light or street lamps glow blue/green or orange- red mercury vapor death image if you don't properly use white balance . preset white balance king , here . i get grey , black white when i preset mercury vapor light . i used preset any light auto white balance setting can't figure . there also setting dial kelvin temps well ! if you this ( i go miles here ) , you're your way . so , trying this d2h , or considering it , read through some digital d2h forums ignore posts slam camera without giving instances . generally , those who pan camera not tried understand it . i bang off images disprove where they suggest this camera fail . when you decent light , you'll decent image . but when you try use it without learning how you maximize system , you come shooting images terrible unprintable . closing , i not paid anyone , i no nikon stock no outside interest writing this except i'm giving d2h credit where it long overdue	1
my 2 year old really active my point shoot camera cannot keep up him . i also don't like washout look when i uses flash . so i researched which slr best meet my needs , mainly catching fast action , candid moments low light photos without flash . canon 30d comes up top list . it best high iso performance its class ( better than nikon sony ) . when i combine 30d fast zoom lens ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 , result amazing . i stop any action daylight , capture every candid expression my 2 yr old fast burst mode , take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod . portraits also excellent sharp image beautifully blurred background ( bokeh ) . even dimly-lit decors disneyland haunted mansion came out superb when we went there halloween party night , without flash or tripod . this really important factor me buy this camera , taking pictures tripod not option when your subject active 2 yr old . but you need good lens make this work well . if you use cheap kit lens , then it probably not matter which camera you pick . remember these 3 all very good cameras small differences image quality you see reviews apparent only when they use best prime lens ( not kit lens)and crop pictures magnify details . sony very good choice if you budget don't need low light performance ( use flash save money ) . nikon more custom function than canon , it really good canon . they both their strength weakness . canon just happens slightly better high iso performance suits my need better than nikon . fair , i should mention nikon d200 tops most reviews camera year , beating canon 30d overall . but d200 bit too advanced amateur like me , better suits someone more serious photography . d80 like " mini " d200 , but slower . so it really boils down what you really need how much you want spend . shooting low light without flash need good high iso performance , good fast lens ( wide aperture , usually expensive ) , image stabilization . if that what you want , canon 30d ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 not disappoint you	1
i purchased this lens take photographs vintage wristwatches . i use original canon digital rebel shots really very detailed . it easy use fact , i hand hold camera capture details hand-made craftsmanship watches . its 2.5 opening welcome change when you use shooting zoom lens it quite sharp edge edge . if you own canon digital slr want pocket some extra coin then this lens you .	1
i don't much stuff , but fits all my dslr gadgets plus my camcorder . fits - my canon xti my canon 50 mm attached . - my kit lens- my new canon 70-300 is- my panasonic video cam- minor accessories ( extra batteries , cables , memory cards , etc)there separators velcros inside , so you configure bag however you want i t.t he only issue i this bag i wan't able configure it store my xti my 70-300 attached	1
if you big lenses ( 400mm f/ 2.8 usm or even 70-200mm f/ 2.8 usm ) this totally worth addition . 2x not kill autofocus f/ 2.8 effectively doubles your lens very little distortion around edges . check compatability canon website . you won't disappointed	1
now , this isn't fastest card market . but it solid , reliable card . camera itself bottle kneck , typically not this card . however , if you using canon dslr recent flavor , i would check if it needs rma'd . known quantity these cards proven lose images . scary . however , i've not experienced mysterious loss images my card or rebel xt . i've only ever pushed cards speed limits my pd70x , definately not my rebel xt	1
i'm new digital slr world . i using built flash my rebel xt . built-in flash alright , but nothing write home . since i spent most my money camera , i needed flash both affordable would get job . this flash met both requirements . if you advance user , you want higher end flash because flash limited adjuastable features . yet , if you newbie like me , this flash great ! it improved my picture quality dramaticly .	1
this lens outstanding . speed sharpness top-notch . i use this lens wide array situations it always delivered impressive results . best lens it class reasonable price . it well built , sturdy , not so heavy so it relatively easy carry around . canon really impressed me this lens . i use it my eos system ( traditional digital cameras ) .	1
pure image quality standpoint , this lens not please pixel peepers . wide end zoom , which i personally use more often than telephoto end , this lens not very sharp , it suffers fairly bad distortion . worse than , me , chromatic abberations ; this lens quite prone significant ca when shot wide end , which look lot worse than little bit distortion or softness . given price this lens , one should expect higher level optical performance . maximum aperture this lens not very large , f/4 wide end , f/ 5.6 telephoto end . image stabilization makes up this some , you comfortably shoot much slower shutter speeds than otherwise , but , let honest here ; this lens poor performer if you want shoot low light no tripod . small aperture makes dark viewfinder , which very big problem if you trying compose picture dark ( using tripod ) . yet , i still gave this very imperfect lens four stars , this not without reason . first all , focal length range quite handy . it isn't mega-zoom everything , however , it covers most often used focal length ranges , appropriate lens use vast majority situations . little bit extra zoom telephoto end handy occasion , it also worth noting lens sharpens up quite bit when you zoom some - it might soft wide end , but zoomed , it quite good . i printed large 20x30 " using this lens digital rebel , no qualms results . yes , there sharper lenses out there , but you lot more likely see difference sharpness your computer monitor than prin t.t his lens ring usm , which enables it focus very quietly , very quickly , whereas slightly cheaper ( 2.8 ) options 3rd parties normal focusing motors slow noisy comparison . if you want use this lens indoors , you best off getting flash go it , such 430ex . lens usable fantastic indoor lighting , or during day , but won't give you good results low light no flash . if you shooting lower light situations ( people particular ) , tamron sigma some good options 17-50mm range 2.8 apertures , i would recommend those lenses over this one . if you'd prefer extra telephoto range , image stabilization so you shoot smaller aperture poorer lighting situations greater depth field ( instead needing shoot landscape f/4 , instance , without image stabilization , you could use f/11 this lens , get sharp picture better depth field . this even more useful close focus range - while this isn't true macro lens , if you take closeup photos without tripod , you want stop lens down greater depth field , helps quite bit . overall , i've fairly pleased performance this lens . if you like worry splitting hairs , zooming all way pictures your computer , this lens likely dissapoint you . if , however , you willing sacrifice optical perfection get very well rounded , useful lens , then i'd recommend it , however , would also recommend you consider 3rd party options , they also great lenses , offer somewhat better value	1
i received tripod ahead expected schedule . i've looking tripods stores around greater boston area . you can't get better tripod money . fact , you can't get anything " decent " under $40-50 even then i'm not sure you get something this good . i it shipped my job few guys office ( which i didn't know ) purchased tripod past where really impressed when i told them i only paid $25 it . conclusion : tripod perfect , no . head looks little like plastic . but it nice rubber feet rubber grip addition everything listed website . this tripod perfect beginner enthusiast photographer .	1
i am impressed quality photos this camera . occaisionally when i turn it lense doiesn't slide out , which little disconcerting . however , if i tap it , or turn it off turn it o again , it comes out operational position . i enjoy using it , amd wouldn't hesitate purchase one	1
if you're looking high-quality telephoto zoom lens fast enough use indoors , you may found what you're looking . 70-200/ 2.8 lens produces beautiful results overall par 135/2 prime lens ( although not quite sharp ) . main downside this lens it big heavy . i don't mind carrying it around my neck camera so much , but when you go use if you put extra effort into keeping lens shaking your hands due weight . it not exactly sort lens i would want toss into my backpack , just due immense size . if you don't mind spending extra $500 , consider also 70-200/ 2.8 ( image stabilization ) version this lens . it weighs even more , but built unit should help compensate shaky hands whilst using lens	1
balance grip really much better . yes i am aware there problems some earlier ones , but mine seems just fine ( knocking wood i type )	1
i owned this lens year before upgrading image stabilized f/ 2.8 version . overall i very happy f/4 lens miss it available because significantly lower weight . sharpness amazing comparable both lenses , f/4 provide plenty background blur . if you shooting mostly outdoors i would recommend f/4 .	1
i taught photography college level , shoot 4x5 view camera work occasion , am very demanding image quality . i am quite satisfied image quality my kodak p880 , particularly after i installed newest firmware upgrade available kodak . i went through several 7mp 8 mp cameras before finally getting kodak p880 . p880 better image quality than some high end sonys olympus 7-8 mp cameras like dsc-v3 or sp350 . i tested p880 against even higher end 10.3 mp large sensor sony r1 difference image quality 13x19 print p880 r1 barely perceptible after minor sharpening noise reduction , which p880 images accept particularly well . zoom lens very useful range generally pretty sharp throughout its range . balance , manual controls features feel high end adequate most semi-professional needs . camera little slow processing storing pictures raw format exposure bracketing modes but really doesn't bother me because i mostly landscape fine art photos . raw file format directly supported most versions adobe photoshop photoshop elements well most other raw processing programs like bibble pro . unlike most sub-$500 cameras , p880 uses regular screw haze polarizing filters , real plus it highly controllable hot shoe . manual focus usable manual exposure control works well . direct mechanical zoom also nice . overall , p880 digital camera either high end point shoot slr-styled camera or one used fully manually most classic 35 mm film slr . although not small enough slip pocket , size still reasonable light	1
there no question paying $100 or more get you better monopod . but $16 sima smp-1 tremendous value . i sony dsc-w5 digital camera everything i think reduce camera-shake low-light photos . this monopod great adding stability making my photos less blurry . key it small enough light enough i take it almost wherever i go . because it so small , i bring it places would frown upon tripod . monopod not total replacement tripod . but this monopod now only addition my camera i take trips	1
if you're professional photographer , you probably ignore this review . but then you probably won't thinking buying this lens anyway , you'll off purchase nice series . however , if - like me - you just happen nice canon digital rebel camera ( or equivalent ) enjoy taking decent pictures , this lens probably work out very well you . i've taken well over 1000 pictures it couple weeks , it performed very much expected . price , it perfect go-everywhere lens . few main points . okay , it not best image quality . even low/medium iso it seems little grainy its not sharp some more expensive canon lenses . it struggles indoors unless you good flash unit , but well-lit outdoor shoots it works very well . course , it would nice nice series , but if you can't afford then this very good value lens . not real professionals , but great if you don't take things too seriously just want bit more zoom - , let face it , who doesn't want but more zoom	1
i read many reviews fredmiranda.com before i purchased this lens i not dissapointed one bit . i lucky enough receive very sharp copy this lens first try . macro shots very sharp contrasty . center part already reaching near maximum sharpness 2.8 anything beyond f4 tack sharp . carefull this lens though . dof 2.8 extremely narrow . don't mistaken out focus shots unsharp . focus properly crank up aperture you'll get some very satisfying macro shots . only thing i wish this lens image stabilizer . canon , how 100mm macro ?	1
this delivered so fast it unbelievable . they sent exactly what pictured it works perfectly	1
bought this remote month ago . it what it says . you even use it behind . great little device price	1
this thing perfect carrying your stuff around not-so-fattening way . i hvae external flash , macro kit , 28-80 lens , 50mm lens , 18-55mm lens , dslr w/batt grip 75-300mm lens attached all fit into main body this thing . everything seperated dividers making me feel confident safe while walking , hiking , biking , etc . addon pouches seem make it bit more bulking you'd want , but bag all itself fantastic i can't recommend it enough - get away huge bulky shoulder bags !! lowepro it again	1
15 years photography experience here ... sigma 15mm fisheye extensively reviewed compared other websites ( go ahead search ) this very good product . canon tighter focus * touch * faster focusing , but massive depth field this lens , it not problem all . aware if you use this 1.6 crop factor digital slr aps sensors like my 20d or digital rebel , then fisheye effect not pronounced film or 1.3 or full frame digital slrs . watch lens flare should direct sunlight hit it also ... but happens any lens protruding or bulbous lenses . this much better bang buck lens than canon equivalent which costs significantly more . if you search around , you find much lower prices this lens	1
this camera called " pro-sumer " model you should really take title seriously . quality pictures it takes just good professional digital camera same resolution . trade off it really not happy thrown bag ( or big pocket , if it fits ) . why ? because canon given it really annoying power-on switch guaranteed turn camera 90% time when you're moving it or bag . compound this problem , lens extends ( your bag ) , pushing off lens cap leaving it open possible damage . so , if you think this professional camera , kept real camera-case , you'll probably okay . if you're somebody , like me , who likes throw his camera bag or pocket , you're going annoyed power switch . said , i love quality pictures all control camera gives you over every aspect taking them . cons : stupid power-on switch always catches turns camera ; lens cap kind loose falls off easily ; widest angle maybe little too telephoto still ( around 35mm ? )pros : awesome pictures ; tons controls all over outside camera allowing you control lot without resort menus ; professional features including flash hot-shoe replaceable lens ; great battery life ; awesome picture	1
i absolutely love this camera . i've told everyone i know buy it . picture quality amazing . there so many options this tiny little camera ! you edit pictures before you even print them . zoom picture already taken save it way , so much more . i take pictures everything ! i charged battery when i got camera , which three weeks ago , it still going . i 7/8th battery life left . i haven't charge it again . i am so happy my purchase ! i hope this helps you	1
yes it very fine lens . 105 mm long end also appealing but after buying this i decided sell it favour my ef 24-70 2.8 after 2 weeks usage . f4 makes clearly autofocus slower fuzzier . bokeh also worse than other one . viewfinder gets darker 1.6 crop bodies . 105 mm make very little difference image size . plus macro option weaker this one . if you don't care weight go ef 24-70 2.8 imho .	1
price quality i rated this lenses 5 stars . if you really want see how good this lens see photos i took europe . i too around 5000 photos . i posted few web ( see link below ) . price i recommend this lens walk around lens . zoom pretty usefull they very realiable ( almost ) very sharp . get this lens instead kit lens ( 18-55 mm ) until you ready spend more . here some my pictures taken europe this lens ( images compressed ): http://www.laplazita.net/europa/	1
this seemingly simple piece molded plastic recommended me professional photographer . basically it shape open box slides firmly onto flash . it small sturdy enough stash your camera bag without worrying damage . when used light disperses more evenly less harsh subject photographed . white box general use . also available green omni-bounce florescent lighting gold omni-bounce warming effect . pros : inexpensive solution better flash photography . quality product works . cons : non	1
works great orignal battery . you never know difference except lot cheaper !	1
this camera amazing . out 3 digital camera under $150 i've used , this far best , beating out kodak sipix . i originally bought sipix , it junk . don't buy sipix that under $150 . kodak some reason didn't seem like it took good pictures finepix , but software little better , kodak . this camera take pictures resolution up 2 megapixels , but i don't even use option because 1 megapixel pictures so amazing . it comes 16mb removable memory card , so you take around 49 pics 1mp , around 24 2mp , it takes short videos 30 seconds mpeg format 320 160 resolution , or more lower setting . lcd screen easily turned or off save battery power , 2 aa batteries it takes lasts pretty long . it nice , sleak design , software no issues windows xp least . only cons i could think only zoom it 2x digital zoom , which pretty much useless , i never use it , since it same thing zooming your picture viewer your computer . so you consider it not any zoom . software it works well , but it could better , options wise . filenames pictures default number depending its order memory card , so if you transfer pics your computer more than once day ( since it creates folders based date ) , you'll rename each pic . but i hardly complain , since pictures come out so incredibly well . i'm so happy this camera ! if you want camera under $150 , this one get . don't even waste your time kodak , unless you want one 3x optical zoom , but that $200 . i use it general purpose , taking pictures freinds such . once while i take picture sunset 2mp , photo quality printed full page . 1mp creates crisp clear desktop wallpaper size images , . 3mp created good smaller images put websites . there no reason buy anything else , go fuji finepix a200 !	1
let honest ... " kit lens " adds approximately $70 overall price camera body not supposed canon l-series quality . sure , you find better quality lens , but not $70 you can't!i plan use this lens knock around lens allows me get more familiar my camera run off some shots . personally ( this personal preference ) , i find i tend want closer subjects anyway - 1.6 factor rebel xt , i'm great shape some my other lenses . if you don't happen already super wide lens your arsenal , you getting digital eos 1.6 magnification factor , then buy this lens . please don't let some other " lens snobs " sway you - few which actually " posers " snap less than 500 pix per year spend more time looking technical aspects picture instead its true artistic value . i hear them now .. " it isn't contrasty enough " , " barrel distortion horrible wide end " , " pin cushion significant " ... i say bah !! these statements true ... sure they ... degree . but let remember not everyone afford picky . buy lens , load camera fresh battery blank memory card get out there !! if you find yourself shooting wide end often , then sell/give this lens colleague go search ( higher quality ) lens ... very little lost . enjoy yourselves take lots pictures ... good luck	1
excellent flash use my canon 20d fantastic price , canon 580ex expensive option , but should i buy one future ? 430ex perfect slave unit . great product canon always	1
i mainly bought this go end lens adapter s2 . it well protect lens , but you can't put lens cap over it . it ends up easier use without lens cap ... quicker when taking pictures . pictures very good through it	1
puts protective glass over your expensive gla$$ without distortion .	1
this handy little tool must not just nikon owners , but all camera owners . genius design function , i would whole-heartedly urge every person camera buy one , or many , asap	1
i love this flash . i just recently purchased it used it 2 big events it worked perfectly . i still don't know everything it capable doing but am still able work it just fine without even reading manual . i would definitely recommend this flash .	1
i chance compare it tokina glass . canon better contrast better distortion , same or even slightly worse sharpness , complete looser build quality . if you ok 12mm - get tokina	1
excellent camera kit . versatile . i lot learn camera , though , it no simple point-and-shoot . however , auto mode , it takes great point-and-shoot pictures . i look forward learning how use it fully . lenses came warranty cards , but camera itself not . i bought sb-600 flash well battery two 1 gb compact flash cards round out kit . camera lens attached large , which i underestimated . $80 camera bag too small it all . great camera , though . price best i could find anywhere	1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
when i bought digital camera , i already knew i would need rechargeable batteries it . what i didn't realize how quickly camera would eat supplied alkalines . i taken barely dozen pictures before they drained point where camera would no longer operate ! so i looked set rechargeable batteries charger quickly settled this one because previous experience monster cable products . it performs better than advertised . initial charge may taken 3 hours , but subsequent charges much quicker . i yet drain these batteries point where they won't operate camera . charger itself attractive unit appliance , led indicator lights up red charging changes green indicate fully charged . it compact enough fit comfortably camera bag plug folds into back it . i good service it highly recommend this charger	1
excellent case , no question it . it stylish well-put together . this not worn belt , though , it must go pocket , purse , or your hand . main thing it keeps awesome camera safe sound , it looks good doing it .	1
i've my d70s year now , haven't regretted it second . controls laid out logically , everything hand . dual control wheels make adjustments fast accurate . i personally love optional grid overlay , i no excuses horizons aren't horizontal . wireless flash system great , though you buy sb-600 or sb-800 get full benefit . this camera bigger heavier than d50 d80 , which my opinion positive thing .	1
if you looking great all around camera , this it ! our kids play sports constant motion sports mode captures it all . also love " last 4 " feature , gets some great action shots . we fuji 7000 before this they definately fixed features bugged me . love new manual zoom ( if you like 35mm lenses your like this ) well battery drain . i used replace batteries every day , now its more like once week amount we use it . my other favorite feature dual memory slots those times where i forget put it back camera after downloading ! so there always one there !. video comes out great new manual lens you zoom during video shots . general , without spending lot more , you get great camera keeps up active " picture happy " family	1
these cameras simple use any i ever seen quality pictures good or better than cameras costing 3 times much . great buy	1
compare price product i highly recommend any one who own canon eos camera ...	1
aside form fact canon charges arm leg 1 dollar piece plastic , remote switch work well . it not feel very sturdy not seem nearly well built canon cameras . people big hands may little trouble using this product . overall , " must " addition anyone interested long exposures , images excellent sharpness depth field	1
this first lens i've owned . i trouble justifying extra expense but am now quite pleased i took step up . keep mind tis ef not ef-s lens . this makes its effective focal length 45-215mm my digital rebel . i love zoom range ( great shooting action shots kids without getting their faces ) ability easily control depth field my nature shots . just uploaded some my recent shots this lens under " share your own customer images " . pete leclair http://www.agentz.com/digitalimagesbyjpl	1
i my canon eos 30d week after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted photography . i bought 17-85mm canon lens it takes phenomenal pics especially using software post-processing raw . i also 70-300mm lens sports/outdoors/nature bursts 5fps beautiful sound . i bought camera through dell rebates currently this best deal out there ! strongly recommend . pay extra $$$ get this over rebel xti . you won't disappointed	1
better than photo album showing off series pictures . buttons fairly intuitive , instructions understandable , there nothing like " first kid block " new toy . getting all sorts comments my picture show	1
what not like ? light , compact comes strap , case wipe cloth . they perfect . keep mind 12 power more challeging hold still	1
i love this camera first day i received it i took 3 rolls film . it best purchase i bought this year . i got real good price it i received it fast !	1
this camera perfect me i [ ... ] [ ... ] it always seems there doing something ide like catch film . this camcorder small enough some days i it my jacket pocket instant makes it really easy catch them moments usually gone time you get them big cameras out bag ready go . also it extract still picture out video clip so them candid shots never missed . settings this camera really easy understand use . it takes really good video pictures although ive not taken alot still pictures because i like extract perfect picture out video clip . this camera takes video cards so your not always downloading onto your pc . ive got few 2 gig cards so ive always one camera ready go . battery not last long time so i recommend couple extra , there pretty cheep here amazon it usually takes one battery download onto pc if you it hooked up your pc any lengh time . i dont know anything camera how they work i just like take pictures so far this easiest camera /camcorder ive seen	1
i'm former 35mm photographer who little older not spry i once i eventually got out habit lugging case equipment everywhere i went . i got re-energized photography digital but small compact point shoot left me wanting more . digital slr pricey friend pointed out i'd back lugging case equipment around me her . she recommended this model more i looked it more i liked it . it fixed lens model , but 12:1 optical zoom what other lenses would really need . it start up fast , zooms focuses internally so there no moving barrel hold . it just every feature advanced amateur could want . it macro . it optical stablization system works advertised . so far i haven't come across anything it can't . this nice unit advanced amateur or even semi-pro who doesn't want go full digital slr yet .	1
it works specified my sony hdr-hc3 hd camcorder . i used it several times cant find any noticeable blurs/distortions using this lens . its little pricey , but well worth money	1
i wasn't sure if it would worth spending money this case . how wrong i . if you're into diving one these cameras , buy it now	1
when i purchased this camera i really conflicted wheather i should get digital still camera or digital video camera . so when i decided still found out canon powershot video feature , i pleased but very low expectations . boy i suprised ! this camera so many fun features both still video pics . quality awesome both ! there video email option so you don't guess if your videos going fit into email . but if you want you create some really good quality video quick adjustment . all it transfers easily my computer . plus still pics there lots easy features choose so you quickly set up any kind shooting sinario .	1
i gave this camera 5 stars because it awesome features . this camera perfect size kids you put video this camera . i love this camera . i think it takes awesome pictures	1
it rated 5 meters but i took it 9 there no sings moisture or single drop . antifogging solution provided works more than hour . microphone records sound well . i high def cam . pack not decrease image quality inside or outside water . specs it stated its buoyancy positive , experience i recomend buy weight it avoid camera going up water while you push push down - even more snorkeling . there special weights mounted enclosure using trypod whole . i would say 14-18 onz it fine . it great item	1
very easy use . menuing extremely intuitive . don't forget order spare disks , 30 mins goes quick	1
i don't like pink so i bought blue bag . i bought black one , but it so skimpy i returned it prayed until this one arrived . i no trouble amazon crediting me return , either . it so cute ! i'm too old " cute , " but i kept it because i needed case my new hp r717 . it small , yet padded enough trust your camera cushioned if you drop it . i dropped my camera it not injured . it little pouch inside store extra battery my camera , not big aa batteries , but flat type come my r717 . i recommend this little bag , or pink one , even if you don't like pink ... or blue . they well cushioned snug , but not too snug you think they tear . sturdy nice shoulder straps magnet closures	1
i recently purchased this camera . it arrived one day before i due fly out palm springs . i took lots pictures this camera pleased all them except night time pictures . this may or may not because i am novice photographer . even night time setting my pictures came out blurry , but all others came out better than i ever expected . i think once i play around it , my night time pictures improve , but straight out box this kinda disappointing me . no regrets this purchase though . also , buy larger memory stick . one comes camera only stored 6 pictures i run out buy .	1
years now i buying " bargain " cameras foolish notion i not need nice one . finally , i got sick it bought exilim ex-z600 . this camera awesome . screen huge , picture quality great , it easy use sooo small . overall , great buy . one downside i only connect it my computer using dock . luckily , i sd card reader , so i normally just use download my pictures	1
this case well thought out snorkeling/diving using your own digital camera without going expense really expensive camera . definitely better choice than using those throw-away underwater cameras or renting one . only drawback it triples size great 720sw camera - since size one its strongpoint	1
this camera everything it says ; yes , it waterproof i very uneasy taking digital camera into water first time !! only reason i didn't give it 5 stars : it slow every other digital camera i've owned far focusing , multiple flashes , then actually shooting . you get your subject attention they smile , frozen , you hold down shutter release good 3 seconds until shot taken ( low light . ) i especially intrigued its " bright capture " technology , but it honestly doesn't seem any different low light than my old sony u20 2mp tiny little snapshot camera . still same flash-in-the-dark look . there fill-flash low light program mode ( among many many others ) , but shutter speed sets itself so slow background becomes messy worthless blob , even if you hold your breath try remain still . my ideal snapshot camera portable , durable , quick , easy , produces excellent results without think your exposure modes . this camera 3.5 out those 5 . it way portable , very durable , easy , produces ok results but you mess settings if you're not daylight , it not very quick . overall i am very happy purchase carry it everywhere	1
philips 8-inch digital picture frame excellent , high-quality device . very easy get it going - included cable computer software make it simple select digital pictures already stored your computer copy them onto device . no need mess around memory cards - although device accepts those well if works best you . everyone who seen ours loves it . it looks great picture quality size excellent	1
i bought this item present , person really liked it !!. he uses it watch deer , other animals . focus very good , i am very happy i bought this product !	1
it lasts lot shots , 1000 shots , it amazing , two these batteries you almost month holiday without any recharge	1
after buying this camera i pleased most part , interface extremely simple picture quality very good . it sleek , smooth design minimal buttons , thus little confusion . there 3 things , however , i'm not happy . one it takes double batteries , eats them up really fast . second thing there no secondary viewfinder , just lcd screen . lcd screen large , which great .. but this why battery life so low . you can't turn lcd screen off , so batteries go fast . third final thing i dislike it there no ac adaptor , so whenever you plug your camera into computer or tv , not using it take pictures , you run it batteries . , unless you somehow find compatible 3 volt ac plug , which neither vivitar website , or anywhere else online i find made specifically this camera . i'm little upset it came no adapter , would so useful camera eats up batteries . i reccomend rechargibles if you're going get this camera	1
10mp , this camera takes some clearest visually stunning pictures i ever taken digital camera . clarity detail alone reason get this camera . display , although pooh-poohed others too small , quite large me . cameras small , lithe design selling point . nothing bulky this camera . you put it your front pants-pocket if you needed . yourself favor get this camera . you won't regret it .	1
i like this small thing . work great cheap	1
canon underwater housings designed protect your camera elements , whether they sand , rain , pool , or ocean . use beach , while snorkeling , or taking shots your kids pool there little or no need worry buoyancy your camera housing . if you free dive or scuba dive you not want your camera housing floating out your hands . these weights easy way adjust buoyancy your housing . kit comes four weight plates so you fine tune your housing buoyancy . i prefer heavier setup added extra plate compared what recommended canon . i'm very happy setup they very easy use .	1
just advertised , very small , very useful , great video , great photos , just what i neededthis second jvc camera i own both satisfy my needs	1
i always say there technology you use technology you impress others . this model helps you both . you nice 5.1 mp still camera mpegmovie4tv video . very fact you camera which you take both still pictures video huge . i never video camera before because i hate carry two camera big camera case , so this obvious solution . i realize instead embracing moment ( which they need memory ) most people often juggle cameras . cons : * sometimes people might confuse it camera phone * buttons harder find * software not best * wish more zoompros : * convince * compact * battery lasts long * flash good * video sound quality goodi wonder why this model not swept market - story good product mad marketing	1
this scope one best gen 1 units market . 36 lines/mm , it just best resolution . most other units only 24 lines/mm . illuminator bright ( almost too bright ) , uniform , crisp edge . it could bit larger , however , so it would fill field view . note if you remove eyepiece or lens , ( put riflescope eyepiece or change magnification ) you break seal unit no longer waterproof . don't bother ir flashlight . it output actually less than built-in illuminator it far uniform .	1
little background first ... this upgrade camera me , just over year ago . i 35mm format over 20 years . i used pentax k1000 body several different lenses , tele-converters filters . work , i've 4 years experience fuji fine pix 2mp " point-and-shoot " . it provided my work very durable ( it , i am construction engineering ) . when i decided switch " personally " all digital i very cautious . i first looked pic quality durability . " advanced-amature " photographer point view , this camera great !!! this camera never leaves my side . it travels me everywhere i go . it extremely durable it mounted " ultra-pod ii " i carry it over my shoulder ( i don't keep it bag ) . it provides me outstanding quality pohotgraphs ( close , far or fast : work or play ) very reasonable price . it takes reasonable video ( considering my 35mm took none all ) . it easy use learn ( even old 35mm guy ) . it lightweight power usage not issue ( nimh way go ) . i take close 20,000 pics year work play . i am always experimenting this camera it limits . i am so pleased this camera ( previous fuji i used ) my next upgrade fuji well ( looking 10mp ) . $$$ you can't go wrong	1
excellent product price . pictures not good , but you can't ask more this price	1
it easy use makes good pictures , easily match disposable cameras require you turn camera wait . i also 1gb san card so i shoot up almost 1400 pictures . it i shoot couple then load them into my laptop send them people via e-mail	1
battery great it pretty nice own two these , so when one batteryis discharged i just pop spare . it stock delivered me reasonable amount time	1
this just arrived thursday so these comments come minimal time camera so far . i am also absolutely amateur user camcorders so i won't able comment quality manual controls , etc . i agree closely other two reviews so i won't repeat their details . i'll try hit few other topics also compare hc7 sony hc90 , earlier model took 16:9 standard definition video 3 mp stills . i taken one hour hd video so far , viewed it through hdmi cable sony 46 " xbr lcd tv ( 1080p ) . i captured few indoor scenes , few neighborhood outdoor scenes , some footage harper ferry west virginia - river , mountain , two trains passing close range while i railroad station there . i say comfortably you won't confuse video this camcorder standard definition camcorder video - when they say high definition , they aren't kidding . if your tv show video off advantage you've grown fond hd , i think you'd pleased this camcorder . my case , overwhelming reason i upgraded camcorders get hd video , so this made it worth steep expense . my second requirement camcorder took decent stills so i only carry one piece equipment around . i already this sony hc90 3mp , so going up 6mp desirable but not enough make me buy something this expensive itself . my only output criticisms so far west virginia footage looks little brighter water little greener than i remember . i didn't play any settings so take grain salt . these camcorders lot manual adjustments you make which i not explored . one or more them undoubtedly would given me improved footage , i'm not unhappy what i think i noticed slightes t.t he stills look very good me so far , but i've only taken 20 viewed them tv . i normally view stills pc . i don't telephoto lens yet so i can't report quality stabilization . i used tripod today readily apparent stability video . i very pleased , way , how well camera moving trains . very crisp where i expected fair bit motion blur . lcd size controls mentioned first looks . i'm perfectly happy 2.7 " lcd instead larger one ux7 . so this wasn't negative me personally . controls ( menus ) highly similar those sony hc90 i already . if you haven't seen them before , there learning curve . if you hc90 or camcorder those menus , you'll right home hc7 . one note : you configure p[ersonal]-menus include things you use most your own order , addition camcorder menus . one thing i forgot each mode ( video , camera , play/edit ) its own configurable personal menu . so i looking things add play/edit personal menu i sure should configurable , but couldn't find them . because they belonged only filming side , not playback side . so you've got three personal menus you create , not one . battery : check sizes batteries . hc90 batteries very thin . i think three batteries hc7 fit entirely within its case . fourth largest battery looked much bigger one dimension such i thought it would extend past end camera 1/2 " or so . other three fit flush into back camera , though they're not behind door or anything . battery life : my impression so far battery life statements accurate , but batteries drain faster than hc90 . this almost certainly function increased power load instead older batteries better than newer ones . ccds stills everything all " more " than hc90 . so i think i'm fine battery life , but you'll need watch it definitely more than one battery . size compared hc90 : this struck me 10-15% bigger overall than hc90 . it maybe 1/2 " longer front back , wider well . i think hc7 one notch up size average camcorder i see best buy . but it noticeably smaller than last year sr1 sony hard disk camcorder , say . i don't see dropping this one coat pocket like i hc90 , but it pretty light still fits case i used hc90 if i don't load other stuff there . fit hand : i found best buy hc5 ux5 hand played both same time . these same footprint hc7 ux7 far i tell . hc5 tape case maybe 3/8 " wider than ux5 dvd case . ux5 dvd case maybe 1/4 " higher . so i found my right-hand fingers curled nicely around smaller but taller ux5 it felt slightly more comfortable . however , i found hc5 extra width made me curl my palm slightly such base camcorder fit solidly top ball my thumb . i played this store , i realized it seemed like hc5 actually easier hold stable because this . absolutely try these two out your own instead assuming this true you . just wanted say two cases differ bit probably feel different you some level . tape vs dvd ( really hdv vs avchd ): i spent lot time wondering if noise reported last year avchd ux camcorders would still present , if i would care any case . detailed reviews still aren't out , so i don't know whether there noise problem there . but i say i noticed nothing footage so far i'd call noise , so my decision go tape hdv format looks very good me right now . i never problems people report mini-dv tapes , so whole transport discussion ( tape vs dvd ) didn't weigh me much . noise discussion effect my decision , though . getting video your tv : " how much money we ? " , apparently . i played tape back tv directly , but that not long-term solution . i heard you capture hdv video then able transform it pc formats suitable blu-ray or hdv burners , if you money . then you need blu-ray or hdv player attached your tv . now , it sounds like many people archiving hdv video dvds data files . then they burn playable dvds where hd down-converted standard definition video . so they get see decent versions video now produce hd versions playback future technology changes prices drop . one other hc7 reviewer also implied hd files captured ulead software could moved ps3 hard drive played back hd tv there . so far , easy cheap path we sd video dvds tvs not quite there hd based what i've read . one extra feature i wish camcorder built-in 20x optical zoom . i'm sure this would affect both cost size barrel negatively , so i " understand " . but would #1 my wish list . overall , i am amazed what camcorder manufacturers pack into these shells now . i know we're talking computers way more powerful image processing than anything existed ten years ago . but it still almost like magic drag camcorder this size around , take some video , then play it back high-quality hd tv looking me like it taken broadcast-level equipment . i know better intellectually , but it really great camcorder like this marries up new tvs so beautifully .	1
after owning using camera month or so now , i am delighted it . i only replaced batteries one time , so don't know what review hullabuloo . small lightweight , many features . choice 6 meg , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 meg photos fingertips . what i really decided this camera macro capability i take photos very small coins , must able get within inch or two . it preforms magnificantly . my previous camera add additional lens this which hassle . i love samsung digimax s600 .	1

this digital photo frame reasonably good picture quality once set up , used anyone selected mode . i it set slide presentation mode people enjoy looking it . i could easily see giving it , already set up , people who not computer savvy , such grandparents . give them new pictures , send new card they slip . said , cost still fairly high buttons top frame useless unless you them memorized or really good vision . i would recommend this product	1

i used some third party batteries 15 minute charger , used die 10 photoes or so . this canon one seems realllly laaast looong ...	1
we purchased this camera replacement our bulky sony dsc-p52 , which stopped working after year or so due problem lens mechanism . naturally , only time tell if this any different , but meantime , here what you need know this baby : good : 1 ) size weight - fits almost comfortably any pocket . much thinner lighter than any previous digital camera i've owned , thus encourages one carry it most anywhere . size also pretty comfortable one-hand shooting . 2 ) big lcd screen - you didn't need me tell you this , right ? makes previewing images taking shots much more satisfying , though sometimes it not appear very clear , especially if subject not static . however , it bright rich color . 3 ) infolithium - this sony name battery tells you how much time it left - only approximately , course . if use consistent , provide you good idea . if you use one function then then , it tends vary much more not useful . 4 ) integrated charger/usb station - flimsy plastic cradle takes care charging on-board battery well providing usb hookup downloading images video into computer . minimizes wires removes need separate charger , though bright white color far match . bad : 1 ) focusing problems - camera cannot focus objects relatively close it . i am not speaking macros , but simply function - or lack thereof - focus small , near objects , such coins , stamps , or text . quick focus objects farther away , though . 2 ) integrated battery - i listed infolithium positive , but fact you cannot just pop-in couple aa batteries means you always need station or plug charge up if you need some juice . i don't know if battery universal , but even if it , it cost substantially more purchase replacement . 3 ) incompatible memory sticks - i not complain sony desire make consumers pay more its cards than adopting standard , but this camera uses memorystick duo , which 1/4 or so smaller than " regular " memorystick . this means hundreds you may invested memory cards previous sony digital cameras pretty useless , they not fit into this or any other device using smaller cards . 4 ) ineffective flash - flash tiny , thus not provide adequate illumination dark . within few feet okay , but farther subjects not touched . 5 ) 3x optical zoom - c'mon , this 2005 ! 3x optical zoom pretty pathetic such expensive camera . 6 ) slow write speed - there decent pause pictures , meaning you not able shoot rapid rate . you certainly take pictures bursts , but it takes even longer write memory stick . previewing images also slow . this also disappointing , it not faster than my older 52.7 ) no tripod hookup - if you wish use tripod , you mount camera plastic station , then connect tripod plastic dock . this far ideal . well , there you it . negatives i listed may insignificant you , which case this could great value you . i am certainly happy it , but i only wish sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows changing standards , compatibilities , dubious long-term quality	1
very compact , light easy hold - full marks design . buttons etc take bit getting used , but ok once mastered . main downside me it only takes dvd-r/rw- not dvd-r/rw+ , bit problem when you pick up wrong ones ! also , problem taking it abroad - i issues charging it it would take standard us uk converter plug pins slightly wider than normal us plugs .	1
case beautiful leather . seems sturdy well made . would more functional if belt holder open ended , i thought . i ordered it my son , but found it very feminine when it arrived . i give it someone else	1
i bought this camera replace 3mp kodak cx series when i thought i lost it . my 3mp took great pics i never any problems it i didn't want learn use different brands software . kodak easyshare software didn't impress me much when i bought first camera but they made some improvements updated version much better . kodak gallery nice option allows you share pics without sending large email files . i haven't used c533 lot since i bought it but pics i've taken come out great . but just like other reviews state , slow shutter speed low light it like batteries . however , if you spend extra money lithium batteries you'll get much improved battery life . all all great value perfect camera point shoot person	1
i purchased this camera replacement canon optura 20 which dropped when estimate repair exceeded price this camera , i decided move . after using dcr-hc28 several weeks , i believe this very neat package . overall , i am very satisfied this camera . one first things i noticed color representation low light conditions much more accurate than canon . i grew accustomed adjusting optura white balance indoor order get accurate color tones . now i am finding , automatic settings work just fine , fact , i didn't reason play presets yet . this camera more " point shoot " type than canon . it provides you manual controls , but they not easily accessible . still , i not found reason mess these . besides , those , who would claim manual settings necessary advanced/professional type filming , i would point price tag ask where when they last see advanced/professional camera under $300 ? this camera also half size canon combined low price weight , produces package i drag me while going beach , bicycling , hiking , etc not worry ruining expensive piece electronic gear , case my optura which , time when i bought it , cost me 2.5 times what i paid sony . so far , i've used this camera all lighting conditions i would expect ever consider . i no complaints its performance . picture seems sharply focused color tones correct . focus fast enough keep up little kids or shoot some sports/action . sound quality microphone quiet acceptable . there seems very little noise drive motor it not picked up mic so it not transferred your recording . all essential controls menus within easy reach . there few negative points prevent me giving this camera 5-star rating . lack any kind accessory shoe or external microphone input drawback . it would nice these , it would increase range conditions under which one use it . still , among my friends , who actually camcorder , 90% don't own accessory light or external microphone , so if it possible lower camera cost omitting these features , it not criminal move part sony . lcd display could bit larger it would not hurt if sony would provide it more freedom motion - it only swings out 90 degree angle certain situations it limiting factor .	1

my fuji e900 fits perfectly also battery charger extra batteries . front pocket additional memory cards great idea . case goes belt or neck strap accomodate personal taste . very nice reasonably priced	1
this my first digital camera . prior this i simple kodak point-and-click model which pretty much quality disposible . i use much higher grade cameras work both 35mm digital . this camera gives you 5.1 mp ability though most shots only require 3mp . i like 32mb internal memory though i've also bought 256mb card traveling . 5x zoom isn't cool i initially thought it would digital zoom works sometimes not others but you must understand what digital zoom really . camera takes very clear optimal pictures . better pictures then i've taken anything else i've owned before ( some work cameras well ) . size small enough put your pocket but not too small one larger hands . different flash options shooting scenes turn difficult pictures into what you want capture . panoramic shot sequence especially favorite feature especially shoreline shots . i've also bought r-series dock enjoy its ability transfer my pictures faster charge two batteries once . this camera worth price you pay but i believe its 2005 model so it may not most up date but it great job .	1
it exactly same thing came my camera- just what i neede	1
i searching web site after web site system like this . i finally found site where i could purchase seperate parts comparable system . however , receivers alone more than this unit ( if you wanted receiver compatible plasma ) . this works great . could not easier install . all components my basement . i ran eye through wall eye barely exposed through single cable face plate , blue led light taped back plate . blue light still shines through faceplate , which perfect . faceplate just below my wall mounted plasma set . no interference . this set up allows me use this system just any angle room adjacent kitchen . works great basic $20 all one ir remote . also , customer service like no other . i several questions each e-mail answered next day great help . made this purchase no brainer . this one product far exceeded my expectations even after reading all great reviews . i highly recomend this product .	1
gs150 performance as-advertised . terrific colour rendering , thanks its 3-chip configuration . camera also option full manual control standard settings , making it even more usable . love joystick ! still find it hard believe panasonic managed fit all this performance into such small package . final score : engineering 1 , customer service 0early production runs this camera seem shielding problem , which causes faint , red , horizontal bands appear when recording very low light conditions . despite fact this widely ( if unofficially ) reported gs150 owners around world , these same owners noted panasonic customer service generally denies problem exists . thankfully , problem easily repaired certified technician . better still , gs150 owners seem collectively deciphered units manufactured september 2005 onward alright . look cameras serial numbers beginning ' h5 ' or higher . you also read all this pana3ccduser dot com	1

this neat idea . you close up pictures really able see them small screen . it very easy load pictures it very handy me show others our most recent pictures	1
solid construction , good optics , nice sound . mentioned others , output usb transfer found handycam console not camera itself ... minor annoyance . all all , this good camera touch pricy but you get what you pay ....	1

i mainly use camcorder recording my kids . i bought this camcorder couple weeks ago . i sony hc-7 before couple weeks which i returned buy canon camcorder . high light performance both camcorders excellent . sony camcorder , i felt best color performance achieved reducing color intensity . low light performance when recording 1080i similar two camcorders but much better canon when recording 24p format . this main reason i prefer canon . 24p recording more sensitive motion which problem if recording motion . still images canon lower resolution but me they looked better than sony . this especially true when taking flash pictures . sony seems little better built . hdmi cover canon poorly built . i liked controls canon better than sony . auto focus automatic white balance worked better canon than sony . auto white balance sony worked poorly indoor light . sony supershot infrared recording canon not . sony more manual controls than canon .

this review coolpix 5900 5mp . you not displeased this camera if you market compact digital camera . this little baby lies comfortably your pocket until you want it rarely fails deliver , no matter what lighting obstacles you throw it path . footprint amazingly small 5mp you'll amazed functionality . i found video/movie feature real useful tool surprises most people great clarity utterly blown-away night shots poor light . think las vegas lights strip , or crowd people thin night light . this camera handled it all . sd card easy access , i recommend 1gb size so you take your time movies . otherwise 512mb card give you 300 photos . but i warn you , you bitten movie bug want use this more more ( provided you disk space or burn excess dvds ) . i also recommend san disk ultra ii sd cards fast recovery speeds , so you don't wait each shot record before going next shot ( this 5 mp that lot pixals store ) . roll side body enables you keep tight grip it one hand shots- feature many small cameras lacked . battery life exceptional , but always , buy backup travel . hit one star frustratingly small on/off button . i know they designed it so it won't accidentally turn your pocket , but my fat finger not best tool .... 2 inch lcd not protected like others too , but so far seems pretty tough , rolling around my pocket sunglasses other things so far not scratched it .	1
this nice bag , but don't buy it canon s2 it not fit . product compatibility lists s1 since s2 s1 very similar i purchased this bag . i can't even get thing bag . it nice bag however put my smaller kodak camera it . there plenty room typical point shoot camera all it accessories . good quality	1
this my second digital camera . although it so much more than my first , it much easier operate . i especially love fact i video my grandson baseball game , then convert individule frames photos ( jpeg ) great quality . i series photos him getting hit . it looks great ! thanks great product . ralp	1
photos printed very sharp . some difficulty printer cartidge expensive they , you can't afford much difficulty . good craft times kids	1
not expect this replace zoom your camera . it not nor it intended so . what it optically bring things little bit closer . this certainly preferably using digital zoom comes so many cameras . lens works screwing into end camera lens where filters would normally put . this means it something which must planned used . it not put while filming taking place ; it place when filming begins . since it easy use , this should not take too long . normal zoom camera used while this lens place . it place just changes limits little bit closer what would normally case not quite far when camera zoomed out maximum . care should taken not get this lens cross threaded when putting it place . quality optics seem fine . i used it sony dcr-vx2100 no problems . this handy gadget handy your case but aware what it not .	1
this very flexible capable camera . if you looking more than point shoot offer , there very few would compare . me deciding factor high quality lieca lens wide angle , if you havent compared this directly conventianal lens you amazed what youve missing . 16:9 ok feature if you plan hdtv veiwing but screen size compromised when you switch 4:3 . i would prefer larger screen lose 16:9 feature . lens cap little annoying well but those issues aside , i am very satisfied	1
bought these binoculars my husband . he loves them . they very powerful he loves way they feel - not too heavy . he look stuff across creek amazed clarity things he sees	1
i am extremely happy this purchase ! i love 10x zoom when taking pics my kids	1
if you use viewfinder instead lcd field , it not appear lcd , you only see it through viewfinder . this different previous models . minor annoyance . quality videos surprisingly good , but it saves them quicktime . mov format . mov not my favorite format , but perhaps others not bothered this . although i heard color kodaks not natural , i found it excellent . overall quality pictures good . price , i think this very good value adequate most casual photographers .	1
i looking expand my lens collection without breaking my budget found this 50mm excellent first choice . i love able shoot low light situations which this lens allowed me . however , auto-focus leave lot desired far speed accuracy goes . i've found leaving it manual focus allows me get more shots faster , least low light .	1
i no complaints . i this camera over year half it reliable , fast , gives me crisp , quality photos ! only option i wish this camera better stabilization mode prevent blurred pictures , but software edits blur without reducing quality . blurry pictures not problem long you know how aim shoot . everyone loves playing my camera because it many cool features make your photos fun ! i highly recommend this camera ( especially beginners or those who just want simple camera capture those precious moments , high quality photos ) . excellent camera overall ! ;	1
we love this camera . it small , easy use , big lcd screen takes great pictures . fuji always great product this one no exception	1
love this digital camera compared our previous ones . we're mostly point-and-click family , this easy-to-use camera good point-and-click gives opportunity more if you should so choose some day	1
this must item your kodak dig . camera . it allows filters , tele/wide aux lenses or any 55mm screw attachment . apart black metal enclosure compleatly covers entire lens assemby , any zoom or focal length . this adds very strong valuable protection your lens . if you accidentally bang camera against hard surface this adapter may very likely save your lens ( camera ) destruction . i always keep it skylight filter , skylight or uv filter further protects lens impact , scratches dust . if used when lens not fully extended ex : wide angle normal zoom , adpter also helps block out stray light acts light shade . kodak aught this built into their camera permanent fixture , but alas they make extra revenue their accessories . buy it !	1
purchased gift well received . seems handle larger chips timely manner . runs everyday , all day no problems encountered . displays vacation pictures clearly . like it big enough view across room . frame more compatible decore than 7 " model previously purchased	1
battery perfect once camera , indistinguishable original .	1
controls this camera not hard figure out . it fun haveall little things you pictures 12 almost 13 , photogerphy somthing i love this camera . if you think thiscamera complicated , well you didnt read instruction guide very well	1
i am pleased purchase . very good value . picture quality good it easy operate . only negative it advertised wood frame when fact it plastic . however , it looks good . this my second purchase this product : one myself one gift	1
one reviews i read before purchasing these suggested reviewer should've them her celine dion concert . i took suggestion they perfect ! they fit nicely my evening bag brought celine closer me i sat second mezzanine caesar palace ! not only - but price right ! i couldn't happier ! plus , now i them our next trip rocky mountain park get up close personal some wildlife	1
this item cute . my only complaint it really only hold camera . there no space extra card or battery . it however convenient belt clip back you could also attach shoulder strap .	1
i get bandwagon here . this superb little camera , definately five stars ! i also tz1 , which showed promise , but limitations . my review tz1 , i noted it lots " noise " pictures shouldn't printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they sharp . i also wanted more manual controls . tz3 fixes improves almost everything tz1 adds some new , very useful features . noise drastically reduced , lens better , sensor bigger , processor not only faster , but produces better pictures . tz3 adds very handy " function " button - or i should say function capability - number buttons same - which gives immediate access five or so " most used " settings without go into menues - which there several . tz3 keeps mega optical image stabilization adds intelligent iso , increases sensitivity without adding noise , ( i not tried 3200 setting yet . ) , increases size viewing screen , etc ., etc . tz3 " well-rounded , " very capable camera . there simply no comparison tz1 tz3 far quality pictures . tz3 wins hands down . my opinion it also beats some big name , higher priced digicams - couple which i own - rather handily . course , big selling point tz3 still 10x lens - now wide angle capability - pocket-sized point shoot camera . this lens sharp , combined larger sensor new processor yields some excellent results . while there no manual controls , per se , camera seems very well without them . pictures sharp , exposures seem nicely ( haven't tried it night yet , but low light forrest shots excellent ) , colors accurate , appropriately saturated , vivid ( ok . i like vivid setting . ) , good contrast , etc . there variety af settings , settable focal points , focus modes . there also exposure compensation , exposure bracketing available - they work well ! live histogram welcome bonus . tz3 focuses down 2 inches macro mode - again excellent , sharp results . tz3 very well speced out . one nice thing gone lens cap tz1 . it really not inconvenient , but seemed always swinging wind add yet source camera shake . tz3 lens includes built lens cover . very welcome . i currently own five top flight digicams ( including this one ) , owned many others , i am most impressed this one - combined convenience results . it quantum step forward . i also couple quite nice , fairly complete dslr kits . they wonderful , class themselves , but when i want very nice pictures convenience pocketable point shoot 10x , wide angle lens , or back up dslrs , tz3 now my camera choice .	1
i used camera three months , absolutely love it ! pictures crisp ( even very close-ups ) , video feature right up there . sound pick-up excellent . i created two dvd combining videos still pictures . folks thought quality very good . battery life rated very good , i found this true . i carry camera me nearly everywhere i go . people impressed size . drawbacks ? because its size , there no connections camera computer , tv or battery charger . docking station small lightweight . because battery life , i never away home long enough need recharging . i recommend camera without reservations , look first casio future	1
this great , easy use camera . i this camera year it seen alot use . only drawback i this camera it eats aa batteries . i bought rechargeable aa they seem last forever ! problem solved . i am purchase second one my son christmas . great camera	1
this enough instrument show you new things sky years come . it sturdy simple operate . it enough light-gathering power ( more important than magnification ) reveal dim star clusters , nebulae , galaxies good enough optics show you surface planets like jupiter , saturn , mars . some advice selection . dobsonians like this one come range sizes . 114mm ( 4 � " ) bit small side but still fine instrument , especially if your ability carry large objects limited . 150-200mm ( 6-8 " ) scope right middle recommended range . 250mm ( 10 " ) like this one big side , you should buy one only if you able-bodied . some advice use . viewing through telescope less like playing cd more like playing guitar . finding objects takes little bit practice . 9x50mm " crosshair " finder supplied this scope great fine searching , but i recommend supplementing it red-dot finder aid initial pointing . you also need buy atlas ( sky telescope pocket sky atlas best available ) , red flashlight view charts without blowing out your badly-needed night vision , guidebook lead you interesting objects . these investments greatly add your enjoyment . what more i say ? this kind scope experienced observers trying steer novices towards decades . although , i recommend you your homework before buying any scope -- learn sky get know experienced stargazers who advise you -- when it comes time purchase , you could hardly better than this scope . more advice , see my encyclopedic guide here amazon , " so you want buy telescope .	1
high iso large screen reasons my purchase . screen great but , when you force iso 1600 , it seems darken pictures more than 800 . i s5200 one seems adjust other options like white balance much better when iso set w/o go full manual option . definitely something improve ! auto option seems work much better i surprised how good high speed three frame shooting works . also , two picture function(it takes two slightly different sets automatically ) saves me lot ' re-posing	1
this camcorder digital age . tiny , multi-functional , flexible . no ancien t-t echnology magnetic tape . any product leading edge , there many shortcomings . let dispense obvious . this device all compact go-anywhere flexibility ease . best image quality , dedicated mini-dv camcorder dedicated digital still camera only way go . fact , buying separate camcorder still camera may likely less expensive than sanyo c6 while resulting superior quality . overall image quality best described " ok " . poor lens zoom aperture more befitting $100 digital camera than $400 device . flash weak not light many scenes any other still camera would light . addition , since flash not offset any way lens , red-eye virtually guaranteed any range . this not problem digital touch-up common practice , but plan touching up more often . low light conditions drag down image quality dramatically video mode . virtually any digital camcorder any price outperform this sanyo video mode any situation , but little day light goes long way towards improving video quality xacti c6 . also , clear , video quality still superior anything seen best analog camcorders . all these negatives , convenience truly revolutionary . one wear tiny vpc-c6 around neck all day . this causes amazing change attitude towards video . since sanyo so compact , no one would think twice bringing it any minor travel . freed chore " packing up " camcorder means corresponding willingness bring sanyo so many more occasions , such visit park instead just weddings birthday parties . whereas mini-dv camcorder requires one hour transfer one hour worth video your computer , sanyo transfers video fast sd card usb 2.0 interface allow . means five minutes or less transfer one hour worth video computer . this ease increases willingess create video share video . no more procrastination over dragging out camcorder wiring manual task initiating video transfer computer . sanyo , just place camera docking station pictures video files available just like files usb flash drive . it difficult overestate significance this convenience . video becomes everyday pleasure , if one so wishes , rather than special occasion chore . if one values this convenience over absolute image quality , this product own . this leading edge product . get most this product , i highly recommend doing following : 1 ) sanyo provided updated firmware their website . this fixes fatal flaw audio processing some people noted excessive distortion - this update makes audio quality competitive other camcorders . addition , this firmware update adds compatability 4gb sd cards ( limit 2gb without update ) . kudos sanyo continuing support . ( note instructions littled distorted translation - what they meant write you need push set button left enter firmware update screen . ) 2 ) video mp4 format playable only quicktime . windows users , this limits video editing included programs or quicktime-specific programs . there easy solution . first , download divx codec ( freeware commercial product ) or xvid codec ( free open source product - my preference ) or ffdshow ( free open source product ) - use your search engine choice find these . second , download utility called " mp4cam2avi " ( free open source software found easily your search engine choice ) . these two programs , video becomes compatable any windows program , including just any media player ( such windows media player ) any video editing tool ( such windows movie maker ) . i look forward seeing how this market segment evolves . freedom bulk digital tedium addicting i am sure image quality continue improve . now , i am happy capturing memories would otherwise lost i continued own conventional bulky tape-based camcorder	1
i bought this camera take pictures my sons playing basketball . my other camera shot dark grainy pictures indoor . i lot success this really nice outdoor shots well . what i just started playing , i love video feature . it so easy use images better than i expected . i bought this camera december present myself i used it constantly recharged battery twice . this major me my nikon devouring batteries afternoon . optical zoom clean , but digital definitely noisy . i fun shooting pictures my kids because shutter speed so quick i don't miss shot .	1
excellent ! they really long life perfect backup your rechargeables	1
ergonomics : perfect . d200 not completely rubber-encased . there rubber where your hands need hold it , plastic where your hands rarely touch it . hand grip comfortable nicely concave where tips your fingers dig . battery door memory card door made plastic , hinge-pinned . simple slide latch opens battery door .... some warned latch could easily ( accidentally ) tripped . memory card door latch , however , uses more secure 45 degree pivoting latch . usb 2 video out/dc-in doors made flexible rubber , these doors extend into body camera hinges themselves . english language operating manual work art . each operating concept alpha ' numerically numbered pictoral diagram , page where function explained perfect english . reader quickly catch how this well thought out manual organized . i like depth field preview , mirror lock-up , multiple-exposure capability . continuous servo autofocus better job than any human following focusing any moving object . if you old manual-focus , film-based nikon slr lenses ' 70 ' 80 , except few rare exceptions , fit d200 . all these positive attributes remind me best , most highly-evolved film camera slr . no wonder so many photographers won over digital media .	1
picture fine this price . i bought panasonic vdr-d100 my daughter because she usually doesn't want anything computer like edit video . when we gave it her first thing she asked , " i edit movies ? " i quick test make sure dvds would finalize work dvd player success 3 computers 3 dvd players . i didn't find anything disc wouldn't play . then i started up vegas movie studio platinum which i use edit my minidv movies . i selected import dvd it went straight minidvd loaded files where i able edit add titles , music , sound effects voice over if i wanted . since i already bought dvd-r/w discs she able reuse them if she ever edits movies because you unfinalize discs reformat them .	1
bushnell perma focus 7x50 wide angle binoculars ideal choice my recent trip tanzania serengeti . they worked perfectly application needed . really happy surprise just how well these worked . we bounced around dirt roads cross country land rovers , perma focus feature outstanding made things simple easy ! :-) magnification level perfect almost every scenario we came across . anything outside 80 feet came through crystal clear vivid color clarity . it really made up close personal viewing all animals we saw . far , these best investment i made before trip ! i can't imagine without them now such expedition . really fantastic performance great value boot !!!! vendor fast flawless transaction too . my opinion you won't disappointed these binoculars . troy :-)	1
i little skeptical this product because cheap price lack reviews . but it just what it says it , i am really happy my purchase . i would definitely buy this again	1
overall its fine viewer however it couple problems . #1 ) it would really nice if there way copy pictures off sd card into memory vice versa . this would invaluable moving pictures around without hook things up computer . #2 ) hooking it up computer pain , instructions not helpful . if you using viewer look images off sd cards remote places ( ie trailcamera ) it works fine , but i'd like ability move pictures off card into viewers internal memory so i leave card trailcamera . #3 this nasty , if you cycle through pictures too fast you " crash " viewer . upon resetting it , it say there no pictures found memory card . powering off , swapping cards wont help it read . pictures still there however but you need then access card directly through computer extract . reformat card it fine reader . what i use it i like it even though it quirks must worked around .	1
i bought this camera my 16 year old granddaughter she just loves it . pics bright clear camera very easy handle	1
i made decision buy this camera based many very positive user reviews . it replaces six year old 2.1 megapixel camera . i am not disappointed . amazon price very good 7.1 megapixel camera boatload features . it also considerably lighter weight than older camera . later i read reviews experts who give it only mediocre scores picture quality . they criticize it no image stabilization leading blur ( especially higher power zoom ) " noise " film speeds over 100 asa . i set up couple situations which both problems should very apparent . then i enlarged smaller portions frames print inexpensive 4 6 test photos . i printed full frame , print would larger than 8 10 . i just not see problems experts criticize . colors rich vibrant . i really appreciate wide range controls . user choose number modes fitted various situations . these result faster shutter speed , or more depth field , or fill-in flash , etc . it not necessary memorize tiny icons selector dial . on-screen prompt tells you what each mode . i also like amount control manual mode . user choose asa rating , shutter speed , apeture opening , electronic flash mode . manual tells how set camera special situations , like photographing documents . when you take picture , through lens screen goes black part second . you know picture taken , unlike camera optical finder . camera very intuitive first time use . i also read most manual on-line while waiting delivery handled camera several times local discount store . when i first installed software i restarted computer , but it repeatedly would not recognize camera . i switched usb cord it worked fine immediately . then it also began work original usb cord . i even checked loose connection . who knows what ! one little thing keep mind this . if camera set continuous auto focus , you aim shoot . if it set one-time auto focus , you must press shutter halfway down wait green light before shooting , if you want sharp pictures . i not know , but expect difference battery life . 1 gb memory card store 485 pictures 7.1 megapixel resolution	1
i've using sigma 10-20mm twice or three times month i am very pleased . such wide angle , you most like need " de-fish " your final shot which remedied cs2 or some other image processing software . 10-20mm , range almost too wide , but after further usage , i got used it . i'm very accustomed 12-24mm range 10-20mm took lot getting used . only drawbacks i know using this lens it really prone flare ( despite marketing sigma stating new lens coating diminishes flare ) biggest aperture f/4 which variable pending focal length . it not fixed aperture lens . i also find this lens it sharpest around f/8-f/11 i wouldn't go beyond because i started noticing degrading image quality very small apertures this lens . but other than , i've pretty satisfied price i paid this ultra wide angle lens . i still would prefer nikon 12-24mm , but i'm not willing shell out much money wide angle lens . sigma price their 10-20mm acceptable	1
i using this scope beach night monitor sea turtle nesting . when up close , image excellent , but not so good far away ( more than 100-200 ft ) . very easy use , fact it waterproof plus ( haven't dropped it ocean yet ! ) . you can't really get feel how good image residential area , but out beach , moonlight , it rocks . most time i don't even need ir illuminator . save power , turn it off , it still provide image available light almost 5 minutes . if you're looking see things far away , this scope won't work well , but things close ( say , one end backyard other ) it good deal . i put mine hard sided padded carrying case , since it gets bounced around atv , haven't problem yet	1

takes great pics 3 " screen really nice . wall plug recharger nice also . i taken pics outside sunny , overcast , rainy conditions . indoors sporting events around house . all settings pics truly wonderful . few instances blurriness caused unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics . however , canon top line powershot commanding higher dollar price this camera really should higher optical zoom . 3x isnt enough when other , cheaper cameras 6x optical zoom . also image stabilzation should included	1
while not ' highest end ' tripod purchases , this one must anyone owning hdr-hc1 or other compatable camcorder . operating camera tripod ( rather than touch screen ) provides steady footage amatuer videographer . unit assembles easily stable panning rotation . only drawback soft storage bag which doesn't provide adequate head protection	1
i haven't used it much but few photos i taken excellent . i'm not photography expert so i'll leave technicalities others . telephoto capability increased noticeably but not huge amount . high quality this lens , wide-angle , obvious . comes caps storage bag	1
i purchased nikon l5 costco 2 weeks ago but returned it saturday after i saw lz-7 . lz-7 way better all aspects than nikon l5 , save adjustable zoom movie mode . pros : takes great pictures ; optical image stabilization ; 6x zoom ; , great price . it also made japan , not china nikon l5 . cons : fixed zoom while movie mode ; no on-board camera speakers	1
seller super fast , product well packaged described . thank you	1
-this camara picture quality nice , depend user purpose . my gf kinda satify it . -function easy use . -battery life so so . -battery charger design not convenience . you put battery into batter charger . recommand get cradle charger , but extra cost . it should sell cradle charger .	1
when i first opened up " super quick charger " i bit put off ... it small , it cheap looking ... compared old nicd charger i used it very unimpressive . then i plugged it . say what you this barebones solution , it works amazingly well . it charges batteries quickly batteries last really long time charges . it exactly what i looking . if i could improve anything it would implement some sort cover battery slots . while it not essential process any means , it would look lot better , batteries would less prone jostled out their positions mid-charge curious cat .	1
i used product victoris falls very pleased . this time i not gone under water it .	1
i'm like most people digital camera . i take bazillion pictures , develop 10% onto paper , then banish other 90% computer storage archives . i mean , i'd love display lot more those pictures my computer , but who wall space or time organize all those prints ? that why i decided get digital picture frame . i looking quite some time , but always turned off small-ish lcd sizes or poor resolutions . then i came across this coby 10 " widescreen unit , 800x480 pixel display ! there no reviews amazon ( time ) , but spec-wise it what i wanted ; larger display higher resolution . i took chance ordered one am i glad i ! display huge , pictures look crisp . colors pretty accurate when compared my calibrated lcd computer monitor . interchangeable frames ( it comes black one well white one ) make it easy match your d�cor . litte remote easy use , but easy lose well , so make sure you place it somewhere easy find . built-in mp3 player nice touch . speakers aren't great ( it picture frame after all ) , but it nice frame play music while slideshow mode . there variety transition effects choose . i haven't tried playing videos it , so i can't comment feature . said , there few things prevent me giving this 5 stars . 1 . adjustable stand made cheap feeling plastic . i've seen other frames much nicer backs . yes , i know it front you looking , but stand should sturdier , my opinion . 2 . angle stand , while adjustable , simply held place friction . it actually one setting it click into , but then it angled too much view normal position . 3 . there seems software bug causes display act weird slideshow mode . well , more precise , if you slideshow mode you choose either fade , mask , or cross comb transition effects , then very top horizontal pixel line starts show black sections . it looks like dead pixels , but once you exit slideshow ( or use other effects other than then ones i listed ) everything fine . i recreated this problem , but i don't know if it just my frame or all these . no biggie . i now use no transition effects it perfect . 4 . this not really complaint product but more coby specs . their website they state lcd 800x480 . great ! so i ordered frame then resized whole bunch pictures resolution . however , when i got frame started using it , i noticed all my pictures black ( blank ) bars both left right sides picture . it turns out resolution actually 860x480 ( which i found out after some trial-and-error ) . it would nice know this ahead time save me re-resize my pictures . plus , sizing pictures 860x480 really weird ratio ... kinda like getting 4x7 prints . i ordered this total electronics ( one amazon vendors ) it arrived quickly . when i reported " dead pixel " problem ( which turned out software bug , not defect , so speak ) , they responded my email quickly offered take it back no questions asked . now that customer service ! overall , i am very pleased this product . reality , it rates 4.5 stars . i'm type person agonizes over something before finally buying it . this purchase , totally unncessary !	1
camcorder compact power adapter workedvery well . i given great help finding theright one my canon camcorder , which itselfwas amazing . 5 stars product helperswho helped me locate right one	1
i bought this camera six months ago my 12 year old daughter . it her ( ours ) first digital camera . i read so many reviews prior selecting this model . reviews this camera so helpful . this camera so easy use it takes excellent pictures . rechargeable batteries definitely must ! this camera best camera this price , no doubt it . we taken still shots videos . it so fun option take video . we some great clips . all i say we so happy camera . we would definitely choose it again	1
this fugifilm padded soft case strong , durable very attractive . it more than i expected . it very professional looking	1
i purchase this lens digital rebel xt body i also purchased through amazon . so far lens performed expected . it solid well built . sticks slightly , when zooming through 200mm . images crisp focus sharp . working 300mm challenge without using mono or tripod . shooting bird flight 300mm trick . overall , good lens $200 . if you more money , then lens image stabilization ( ) would way go .	1
my sony fx1 great low light capability , 3 lux , but eventually you need extra light . using your software lighten dark shots likely reveal some degree graininess , no matter which camera you use . i'm so glad i bought it . used it my birthday party . though overhead light good , dark corners room require more light . if you consider yourself advanced , semi-pro , or pro videographer , you must light . my only major beef it runs either 10 or 20 watts . no variable 5 , or 15 . it worth getting long life battery like np-970 . independent power source ( battery ) plus . but no outlet plug adaptor i know	1
novice astronomer i really enjoy sharp , steady view these binoculars . view fairly steady even i.s. off - depending how stable you course . my binoculars cost more than my telescope !! my telescope decent one too . but i think they worth it . you see so much more night sky than what naked eye see - far . they course great during day too . their weight not much issue me , although each person different depending their viewing habits . i think hard carry case would best but it not big deal my use . i recommend this pair binoculars anyone who serious great quality performance	1
this lens fairly inexpensive reason while it definitely lets you get really close image definitely larger than without it , fact fz7 fz30 macro settings already so good image perhaps 15% or so bigger than without it . if i i'll post couple flower images permit comparison without lens . camera i fz7 . because i want large image possible my focus i am very happy	1
this case great quick day outings . it rugged keeps camera safe . my wife throw it her purse i don't worry it getting banged up she doesn't worry it too bulky . everyone should two batteries any canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead .	1
i needed tele lens complement my d50 purchase . didn't want spend too much money it but i needed one least matched my lumix fz10 sharpness . this certainly vr really works , i am able take sharp pictures up 1/40 . my d50 flies it	1
this nice lightweight tripod sony . stable well built . i used it both still video cameras without any problems . it would nice if it came travel bag some sort	1
easy learn , takes very good photos well-lighted areas but you need use flash dimmer environments - its low-light capabilities aren't great . very fast readiness time moment you switch camera - bit slow recharge flash , though , there bit lag when you press shutter button when photo actually taken ( not so great fast action shots , even though it touts " sports " mode ) . it good beginner camera , good pocket-style camera , but certainly not mistaken high-end unit .	1
i really enjoy my photosmart r725 . it small , easy portable , takes wonderful photos , very versatile terms settings . i just one thing i don't like it , that fact there no viewfinder . there lcd screen back which acts viewfinder , but it hard see bright sunlight , i'm afraid it eventually become scratched beyond use . now , it great but i'm not sure how it hold up long run . same time , it not spendy , so it might worth it	1
i love this camera ! i shake when i take pictures this easter every picture i took came out perfectly ! there so many options this camera i am fun just playing it see what all it ! i would recomend this camera anyone who looking high quality camera good price	1
great seller ! shipping very fast ! this battery out oem one came camera ... very happy ! thank	1
this flash perfect back-up studio , or main/flash fill amateur studio . i use several w/slaves lines images rival set-ups cost thousands dollars . i like they light easy pack transport . they reasonably priced . they around long time not bells whistles . sunpak auto/f-stop manual . if you real photographer , you know how use them . down side if your sunpak plugged into wall , it takes far too long recharge ( sometimes 3-5 seconds ) . rechargeable batteries seem work best 1-3 second recharge times flashes .	1
i enjoy convenience point shoot digital camera . my minolta dimage ( 15% small size than this camera ) reached end its useful life , around 5 years . minolta 3/4 " screen back . ( this one 2.5 " screen- great colors)the best feature i liked my old camera fact there not telescoping zoom lens . i don't like fact part needs move so often possibility get gummed up dirty . therefore , i excited this camera internal zoom . tonight i bulls game , 300 section ( nose bleed ) , able zoom get individual photo kirk hinrich . 3x optical zoom incredible , but more so incredible digital zoom . i also able zoom into jumbotron , it looked crisp if i taking photo directly . action shots great . low light shots great ! it exactly what i looking	1
i absolutely love this camera . i got it 3 months ago i cnt imagine life w/o it . im 13 nd mega clumsy nd it still not one single scratch it . it eats up batteries but so wat ? i love it buy it	1
housing worked great . took it 80ft scuba diving flash colors came out ok . no leaks access all functions plus .	1
i love this camcorder . it very easy use , piture quality great . you record wide screen or full screen . light weight , fits palm your hand which more stable less shaky when taping . controls within easy reach while taping . it so easy use both my kids even using it they only 9 6 . it also great price . can't wait all our summer vacations start taping . i bought this camcorder two weeks ago best buy . i just wrote my review then read others i add this , there comments made you hear tape while recording then play back . i slightly hear noise when i am taping , but i cannot hear it when i am playing it my dvd player . hear noise while taping you it right next your ear . but not noticable playback computer or through dvd player	1
i am just average guy when it comes using camera . probably below average . i started trying use 100% sony electronic products because my computer sony sony-sony linkages make easy use . given , here what i think product : 1 . it amazing how much camera you get money . compared just 6 months ago , or year ago , this lot camera money . it very small , fits easily your pocket , but takes great pictures . also , it very easy use recharge . 2 . visit sony website , suggests sony new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras very similar . this makes it hard compare cameras , even within sony brand , makes you feel if your camera obsolete minute you buy it . 3 . problem this camera , given it so small -- not shake . your pictures blurry . i am typical guy , very little fine motor control . my hands trouble holding small objects . holding this camera one hand taking picture -- well results not pleasant . 4 . i tend disappointed telephoto capabilities these small cameras . i guess if you really want zoom , then you go big camera . but it still seems like small cameras could offer more . 5 . said all , end , this camera small easy carry , light weight , durable , it also easy use . when you look it , it looks well made . i ended up giving camera my in-laws , because they lost theirs . my in-laws tend technologically challenged . i said them , just leave dial set little green camera , snap away . i say - they love this camera . overall . money , great purchase , technology amazing . just grab it two hands or develop steadier aim than i .	1
excellent camcorder . only thing i would different spend little more it would take go up pv-gs85	1
i several digital cameras this tops them all !!!! everything they say it , true . i love not even think batteries , i didn't believe what people said battery life , i just happy i didn't need think batteries , but i just got married my 13 year old daughter took more than 100 pictures this camera her pictures almost good photographer i hired yes camera battery lasted all day thru next 4 days our honeymoon 200 pictures taken , no low battery light !!!!! i even going buy my parents one . also , one more note i love how fast you take pictures , no wait 4 seconds shots . i kodak digital before only 1 1/2 years old hated it , i hated download procedure , it didn't put your pictures onto your hard drive , but it own little cubbyhole trying attach them your email absolutely nightmare , you'd identify picture copy it your desktop , remember what you called it then attach it your email . this main reason why i purchased this camera . i never own anything else , especially kodak .	1
i bought this underwater housing anticipation trip galapagos . it worked perfectly , i obtained some really incredible shots , both still video . combination canon sd550 this housing amazing . i make sure lubricate primary o-ring each time i opened housing . but need so reduced using larger , 1gb memory card - both card battery would last little over two dives , before i need change one or other	1
kodak v705 black : small , carry pocket . wide angle lens , great group photos . fast start up time . video mode easy , built mic picks up all sounds . camera stitch 3 photos together-great vistas . i am happy this camera . bought v705 silver my friend she loves it . kodak makes easy take photos . weak flash- try not more than 6-8 feet away-or use photoshop photos	1
this accessory very useful when taking group pictures photographer included	1
best binoculars i owned , i many . excellent clarity , great field view too . nice size also not big , not small . you cant go wrong this fine set , highly recommended	1
reading reviews this camera reminds me cameras tools . imperfect tool hands master much better than perfect tool hands amatuer . i am not master , but i appreciate this camera what it what its limitations . when you use iso settings higher than 200 you see increased noise . i think it great little camera i used it lot my latest photo project . keep mind one assets this camera its small physical size . this also means small optical lens = less light gathering ability . there no way compensate this camera - so know this limitation deal it .	1
this very good camera price range . i always good luck sony products , unlike some reviewers here . resolution viewer window image quality itself more than what i would expect camera this price range .... it pretty decent . what most people use dv cams , this camera doesn't suck all . i like how tiny it . it doesn't go much past palm my hand when i'm holding it . also it very easy figure out just exploring menu touch pad . color graphics icons menus add nice touch . beginner could start filming very soon after opening box , i think . camera feels sturdy my hand , i mean i don't feel like viewer window going break off when it open or i could easily break buttons normal use . others mentioned , you buy 4 6 firewire if you mac because ilink cable comes it s-video input tvs . also battery comes it 30 minute battery but i would bought extra one anyway because you never want wait around while your only battery charging . software cd do-it-yourself install , least mac . it might not pc . i'm used guided through installation process ... ( since least early 90's!) but i drag folder my hard drive my darn self . minor thing but i would expected more major company like sony . but reason i give it 4 star rating instead 5 because firewire goes into base , not camera so you cannot camera tripod while it connected your machine . i realize this not big problem very many people but since i stop-motion animation use frame grabbing software , i need it connected firewire tripod while i'm working . i almost returned camera when i discovered this but instead i hot glued velcro bottom base my tripod adaptor so i could firewire plugged attached tripod .... kinda ghetto . i figure it worth it though since i got such good camera price ( i paid $299 sale it . ) if you're looking decent but cheap camera i would recommend either this one or hc42 if you want shoot widescreen .	1
i am female bowhunter who really trouble judjing distances green fields . this great product . it easy use very accurate	1
all-purpose color film , i nearly always shoot fuji 200 speed . it cooler tones i prefer my images good saturation level . only drawback i've seen while looking various film prices here they way over-priced ! only place i've seen where you pay more film supermarkets . any regular camera store or photo finisher this stuff lot less , you won't wait it ship	1
this film great color production performance . price also just right . you can't go wrong fujifilm superia x-tra 400	1
my printer fits perfectly , plenty room paper tray , extra paper few other things i managed get also . i love this bag .... thank	1
after researching several cameras this price range , i bought rebel t2 last month . it met my expectations perhaps then some . after recently trying out friends camera 150 . -ish range , i partially regret spending what i . it all comes down what you need , want , how many bells whistles you like . money though , compared competitors , i still think i made good purchase . after all , if i use it ten years , which i most likely , i surely got my moneys worth . bottom line : no complaints it	1
yes this very good first camcorder . i am first time user any cam corder . i olny mine month or so but i made several films it it very inersting . but software harder use movie maker . but if you first time buyer then i would go this becasuse 20gb engough use .. but battery life short but u wont need make feature length film !!! it just fantastic . enjoy ..	1
this cable came cheap packing it not any logo it so you can't say which company it belongs . i used lot sony products i feel it not up standard sony . it works great no problems so far . it flexible kinds so you don't worry positioning your laptop according your tv .	1
so far , i really love this camera . it very user friendly gives you option put it very basic mode or normal mode . what attracted me purchasing this camera because long battery life because picture quality . it large viewing area which nice it very clear . i recommend this camera	1
i've this digital camera almost year . it fourth camera i've owned . i spent quite some time searching compact camera i could carry everywhere . amateur photographer ( mostly taking pictures myself not others ) , i didn't want lug around extra bag just my camera . it fits discreetly your pocket or small purse ( formal nights out ) . size weight this camera its best feature , this carries through newer generations this camera , too . this perfect camera everything selling items on-line landscape scenery . my pictures always turned out beautifully , wonderful color crispness . i discovered " automatic " lighting feature not always most ideal , but you re-program just anything this camera . it really quite good camera , given its price these days newer generations out there , it steal	1
this great camera- it so thin , takes amazing pictures , even when subject moving . best shot option makes taking pictures under any kind lighting great quality . i suggest this anyone	1
this camera case great . it very small fits my coolpix 4600 perfectly . there enough room fit extra memory card some batteries ( but batteries make it tight ) . i originally purchased camera case listed 4600 , but it little bulky zipper could scratch camera if you aren't careful . this camera case not come strap like other , but something i would never use . i highly recommend this case those who want small sleek case protect their camera .	1
considering price this camera works great , i use it taking family pics wonderful . what i dont like lack zoomgreat product anyway	1
new olympus stylus 770sw nicest camera date i've purchased . it takes great pictures extremely durable . picture quality awesome all types weather conditions lighting . i stronly suggest purchase this if price right	1
i bought this camera more than half year ago . my intention get decent camera images , but then also able use it filming short movies . i'm very pleased its performance . good lighting conditions , colors come out amazing . i really really not expect them so vivid sparkling ! darker conditions , well , it still works fine , not nearly bad i expected some other reviews . photos might grainy or not vivid anymore , but stuff still perfectly suitable show photos people . filming , it terrific . i mean , resolution great ( sth like 848 640 or so ) , better than what one could possibly expect regular camera . quality super awesome , looks very neat computer screen . respect . it pointed out you cannot zoom while filming , but not many cameras out there . oh , it also very small gigantic screen great battery life . great buy	1
proving there life old dog yet , bushnell come up this , successor out-dated , poor-performing trophy splashproof spotting scope , i say , it fantastic improvement . soon i took it out box i impressed its styling , shape , colour , course , waterproofness . i set it up my front room spent happy couple hours watching my neighbours coming going , they oblivious my surveillance . it not most subtle ' scope out there but stick blanket over your head you're laughing . any one who caught out rain appreciate this little beauties moulded plastic housing , water really roll off it like , erm , water off duck back . stunning	1
i liked this lens . i used it , first time , while traveling through peru . it light-weight easy use . 200mm , most my pictures turned out great , especially when i steady ground ( taking pictures rocking boat no tripod bit challenge ! ) . i've printed some 8x10 close-ups i took using this lens i quite impressed quality . it also my price range . overall , i'd say it " good bang buck .	1
i deal major brand cameras panasonic cameras my personal favorite ! i've seen people whine " noise " they make many times but never found it problem . i own fz10 fx01 my personal cameras . fx01 very fast camera takes great pics ! i love 28mm wide lens . compared most cameras i've used fx01 real good job metering light exposing images . i love panasonic solid build reliability . they may not popular canon or sony but my opinion every bit good .	1
i own this camcorder 6 monthit good camcorder , esay use , easy bringas it design purpose , pc-55 enough home useonly one thing i want mention here , before i buy this camcorder , i thought i record video ms duo mepg format , it easy post-edit pc , you know , tansfer minidv tape computer may need huge space save . however , when i replay video which stored ms , sreen full mosaicfortunately , when use dv type record , this situation never happens . good quality . one press photo button also becomes useless because bad quality	1
this my first camcorder , so i don't much compare it , but i've enjoyed it so far . it easy use . picture quality seems high . only minor problem i've found headphone input . try three different sets headphones before i could find one would fit into narrow slot where headphone jack	1
getting great pictures this new flash my sony digital slr camera	1
i ordered this hoping it would fit my camera accessories it . i stylus 750 plus pop up screen shade , extra battery , extra picture card . there two slots specifically designed fit two picture cards inside cover . main compartment , small slit fit extra battery or two plus creit card perhaps bit paper money . ( it won't fit much more than , though . ) it compact , stylish functional--i'm glad i bought it	1
i looking specifically magic combination all-around video still camera compact built very solid i travel easily . i this camera since dec 19th , 2006 . i very bad luck my previous camera , canon elura used minidvs . when it worked , videos great , but cassette mechanism kept falling out adjustment failing trips or gatherings , i lost many unrecoverable moments ! i extended warranty sent it back 3 times , but they never able fix it properly . perhaps this unusual lemon , but i not want take chance again ! many media types , i've told sd cards most durable almost indestructable . i liked idea no moving parts recording videos . addition , i tired separate digital video camera , technology finally arrived combine two . non-professional camera person looking catch candid home travel shots videos , i've found this great little camera . it amazingly small , really fit coat pocket . extremely solid , it also snap use , yet still provides powerful manual override abilities . camera turns within few seconds . video colors extremely natural not oversaturated any way , resolution very fine . microphone works well , course there no " tape hiss " since there no tape . still photos fair quality . i printed some 8 10 they looked decent : however , if very-high quality photos what you after this not camera you . again , this definitely snap-and-shoot-for-memories crowd , not people who want win photography awards . miniscule pop-up flash amazingly powerful . i also looked sanyo which competing sd model higher still photo resolution ability , but it not any motion compensation ability . given how small these cameras , it not possible hand-hold without jiggling it lot , so i ruled sanyo out . okay , now negatives . there quite few , but what it i still found this best camera my purposes :( 1 ) camera not record well low-light conditions , i'm sure due light required 3ccd color processing small size lens ( cost compact ! ) . filming indoors requires pretty good light ensure decent videos . my christmas tree light pictures disappointing , my backlit scenes came out looking like shadow-puppet plays . ( 2 ) cost buying additional 4gb cards high , i am worried misplacing them because they so small . ( 3 ) i experienced wide swings over- under-exposed still photos using flash , although i ( usually ) able balance brightness contrast my photo editor . i'm sure this partly due not used camera yet , but whole idea not worry such things . flash fill-in backlit subjects works amazingly well . ( 4 ) lcd display camera not synchronized same level brightness contrast your tv set or your pc , which you adjust upwards during playback . thankfully , my sony tv allows custom adjustments each input source . ditto when you creating dvd ... you need increase brightness contrast match what you see when playing back scene through camera own lcd viewer . ( 5 ) there no still photo zoom playback camera ( least i not found it yet ) . frequently , i think snapped photo comes out okay , only realize when " zooming " image pc review details it slightly blurry i need retake it . ( 6 ) you need use included software view mpeg2 videos , mpeg2 not included driver editing tools i've reviewed . ( 7 ) there no still photo editing software included , only video software . i supposed panasonic assumes everyone their own photo editing software already , but i didn't . my canon photo editing software works these photos , so i am using . ( 8 ) finally , battery fits inside enclosed compartment , so you not able buy extended battery pack . since there no energy required running hard drive , dvd burner or tape , admittedly batteries seem last longer before recharging , but i still can't see taking trip less than 2-3 packs . i guess i spending extra more batteries ! even these drawbacks , there no doubt this amazing sleek winner really no competitor its class i intend use heavily home my travels	1
i went ( thinking it cheaper ) ebay route- $10 more i got new one here it works . ebay nice , but when it comes stuff like this i learned my lesson . i've never gone wrong ordering amazon , fact i just ordered oem nb-3l battery my sd500 ; tried radio slop route it won't go over 20 pictures . again , shame me trying go cheap	1
i several different binoculars small hand held large pair nikon i use wildlife spotting . i never anything performs nearly well these . i am serious nature wildlife photographer used high end canon photography equipment years . when i saw image stabilized binocular available " " glass , ( this symbol canon uses identify their finest optics camera lenses ) , i bought them immediately . these binoculars little bit heavier than non stabilized pair , but weight easily compensated stabilizer . once you press stabilizer button , scene lock , effect amazing . i tested them looking sign 100 yards away . my normal hand shake i could not read sign distance . soon i engaged stabilizer , image locked into place never once moved . it performs well my camera lenses . far optics , they , my opinion second none world . image significantly brighter than any other set i , calrity sharpness incredible . night viewing capabilities incredible . finally , huge plus these binoculars completely fog weather sealed . change amibient temps , use them rain , not allow condensation get into unit . wonderful feature those us use our equipment other than nice weather . things aware include : these relatively large , which suit medium large hand size . if you very small hands , your may not like feel unit your hands . second , lens caps not perform well . they simple not stay unit . although me this not serious issue , it one area canon could much better job . you get around this issue attaching good uv filter lenses . ( you should probably this anyway protect glass)finally , strap carry case comes poor . it too thin comfortably worn extended use . i would recommend you find really comfortable aftermarket camera strap use these . summary : outstanding performance quality . little larger fell your hands than some people may like , but once you learn use them , i not believe any serious birdwatcher or sports fan would ever let them go ! i give canon binoculars 5 star rating .	1
loved this ! it awesome because it both land sea camera , so you need just one ! you get tons accessories flashes it . it easy use program it comes allows you all kinds cool corrections including making your photos more focus case you shot them blurry ! i cannot wait use it again , well underwater diving i mean	1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shapped three three quarters inch long offers some protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . there nothing more irritating than reviewing your images find dust spots or other flaws . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing or replacing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 70-200mm f/ 2.8 ef lens normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . fortunately canon provides storage case lens used addition your camera bag . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store len	1
i humped this thing around dc last week 7 hours , not worry mention . well balanced , i it full camera , 4 lenses , flash miscellany . i cut all extra straps off , just shoulder harness left . it looks good too . course , it great advertisement thieves so never let it out your grip .	1
this monopod very sturdy easy set up . i looking monopod capable handling weight my large canon lens ( over 3 lbs ) , this one job very well . i mainly use it taking soccer pictures , so far , i'm very pleased . i highly recomend it	1
i use this monopod my pentax optio w20 camera panasonic video camera . i use it when camping it doubles sturdy walking stick . when i'm out wilds people think it walking stick until they see my small camera perched top it . it really improved my ability stay steady blur free my new pentax which no optical viewfinder . i like quick adjustment legs opposed screw type . i've also used this tripod stick my video camera out my sunroof cruise through new england catch autumnal leaves while driving which given some interesting results . i plan same thing rt 1 film big sur highway . only thing i need get ball head adjust angle camera . price this steal hearty deal	1
mp100 served us well since getting it 2 months ago . like other reviewers , i wasn't expected whole lot after disappointed $40 monopod made those well under 6 feet tall . quite stable , usable walking stick , easier reset height than competition under $50 twist-lock legs . this monopod definitely exceeded my expectations ! seems niche here higher priced version pan/tilt head , but i 30yr old leica table top tripod pan/tilt head combination works great ! balance , can't beat even if all you order mp100 pay $6 or so s/h ! use beach or where dirt grit air , you'll want wipe down legs before collapsing ( cloth used gun storage work great ) or you may grit legs scratching mp100 legs subsequent use .	1
this my favorite lens . i could not carry heavier long range teles , it hard decision me . end , i chose this because it lighter than zooms . previouly used 75-300 zoom , i leary getting 300mm prime , because i may miss 70-300 range shooting . but clarity colors so true this 300 prime , i don't look back . easy handle , not so bulky . fast , impressive photos . even when i add 1.4 teleconverter shooting 500mm range my 20d . i use f4 alot , no problem , great clarity . awesome lens price	1
amazing quality affordable price ( still not cheap tho ) . this lens takes great quality photos my daytime/outdoor performer . although i don't think equal 1 f-stop when it comes low light situations but it sure very helpful these high f-stop numbers	1
while this review not technical others all i say quality end result well worth money ! i shot wedding this past weekend 2 days after receiving this lens am just going over some photos all i say this piece glass given me razor sharpness i've looking . i've hesitant into jumping into " " lens arena but now i'm here i could never go back ! don't settle less ! your photography worth it	1
i both lenses , 24-105 4 28-135 3.5 - 5.6 . i 20d , but my wife i decided we each wanted camera ourselves so i bought 24-105 lens 30d 2 months ago . i so sure i'd see big difference lens since my 70-200 2.8 such superior lens . thing , i can't justify it . i've set camera tripod switched lenses back forth taking pictures identical light settings variety subjects . ( they both take extremely nice pictures ) maybe full frame sensor difference would apparent . this point i like extra reach 135mm . i'll let my wife use $1200 lens . my recommendation : money cropped sensor camera i'd stick 28-135 lens	1
everyone gives this lens rave so maybe i should approach this terrific lens shooting pov . shooting wide open f2at 135 gives your pictures distinct quality you would never get zooms , there isn't zoom this focal length this speed either . few primes come close but they're nowhere near sharp wide open . af fast very accurate lens great feel 20d/5d/10d body even wo battery grip cameras . close up magnification . 19x . 21 therabouts nice bonus this lens , letting you get closer wo too your face tight headshots . i always felt photographers usually sweet spot when shooting certain things like some portrait photographers like distance 85mm gives them when approaching subject , turns out i'm liking 135 focal length quite bit headshots 85 torso head shots . one thing i like this 135/f2 combo there enough dof get most main subject view focus but background still blurred out . it really great when you want subject focus nothing else , opposed 85 1.2 parts subject could melt into background resulting images little too ethreal some tastes . couldn't you just stop down 85 ? sure but relationship foreground background would still different 135 . 135 f2 give result that juuust right . backgrounds just little more compressed foreground but foreground sharp but background gone . almost like you lurred background photoshop . but you'll never get same results blurring photoshop , one thing highlights would get muddied blur treatment ps while highlights stay clean f2 . don't just use this thing portraits , use it way you would use 50mm try frame such , again focal lenth wide aperture give interesting result . i basically use it candids portraits during wedding . fantastic lens , very sharp , very handholdable , focal length terrific portraits bokeh very beautiful , equal sharpness 85 1.2 or any canon $5k lenses . this probably best lens you get price , only lens i've used better saturation contrast 35 1.4 . downside : not handholdable 50 , 35 1.4 or 85 1.2 during low light situations due it focal length	1
man . what lens !!! it not cheap , i dont ' find 135mm particularly useful focal length my 20d but after seeing glowing reviews this one both [ ... ] , i decided buy one try it myself . it not cheap $900 , but it worth every penny . this one absolute stunner . i cannot believe my eyes sharpness f2 it improves very little when stopped down . bokeh unbelievable !!! i dont ' hesitate shoot f2 i don't find it necessary stop down just increase sharpness . size build perfect although i don't like canon hood design . why can't they simply make hood same crincked finish lens ?? then they would not so easily scratch . it beyond me . but that not problem lens itself whenever i use this lens , i know i one best lenses ever designed . it forces me excel myself knowing now , only limitation me , photographer not camera or lens . absolute beauty . go try it yourself . i try shoot this much possible results stunning . i just wish it came weather proofing image stablization like canon modern lenses but that just nitpicking . i love it it	1
i am really impressed results i get this lens . this my first usm lens 85mm new me . it serves me really well taking people pictures outside - fantastic background blur fast enough low light indoor close ups . full time manual focus handy too times . my tamron 17-50 , this lens great combo me	1
i decided rave this lens after taking 80 portraits , or head shots , children theater production . i set aperture 1.8 shot away inside temple great indirect soft lighting . results exquisite ! background , located five feet behind subjects subtle blur while subjects came life ( single strands hair resolution ) . not bad my first experience shooting portraits . now better part i get equal or better results thousands pictures i taken high school basketball games . i set my iso 400 my digital rebel xt get shutter speeds 1/200 1/1250 . again , intended subject jumps out . there no red eye ( or white eye ) using flash light scene freeze action . so after much experimenting , i prefer this my 70-200 f4/l my 24-105 f4/l lenses indoor sports lens . i love all these lenses . this one wins area price fastest lens . this my lens choice majority my current shooting situations .	1
i bought this filter put front 18-70 dx lens my nikon d50 . it works well protects front element lens dust , dirt , fingerprints whatnot . it seems cause little vignetting ( slightly darkened corners ) extreme wide angles ( ~ 18mm ) -- but what i've seen so far it isn't terribly noticeable , ' specially price	1
this hood comes 100-400 , so don't buy it separately . pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
i've used canon eos 10d 5 months now i'm absolutely thrilled it . eos cameras extremely comfortable hold handle . auto mode , camera produces correctly exposed , sharp photos . unlike my canon powershot , camera takes picture very little delay after depressing shutter button . creative zones , you set aperture priority take , example , selective focus shots , or use shutter speed priority set slow shutter speed take some good blurring shots . auto focus quick accurate , though how much camera how much lens i not know . i never use manual focus mode . pop-up flash works great lighting subject shadows or back lit . i now find it bit frustrating use my film camera ; i'm addicted viewing my shots spot . i canon eos a2 film camera i purchased 1995 . since i'm familiar eos system canon system lenses , i chose 10d over similarly priced nikon prosumer digital camera . i like my canon cameras so well i bought canon digital elf my sister canon powershot a80 my mother . both reportedly excellent cameras . 10d , i've used canon 50mm/compact macro , tamron 28-200mm canon 15mm fisheye lens . because difference way film camera this digital camera operate , you multiply focal length lens 1.6 figure effective focal length when used digital camera . so , example , 15mm fisheye lens effectively 24mm lens 1 0d.i bought 1 gig imb microdrive storage card allows me take 400 high res jpg or 160 raw format files . if you shoot auto mode , camera only capture jpg format . if you shoot manual mode , you select jpg or raw format . if shooting raw format , ensure you software program , such photoshop cs , open raw files . know not all developing printing shops accept raw format . but many image libraries only accept raw files ( or high resolution tif scanned slide ) . raw format files , i've found many my shots require bit exposure adjustment , but this simply matter moving slider bar photoshop cs . when you first open raw file , you get adjustment window allowing you play exposure , tint , saturation , white balance more . you even simulate warmup filters such . very cool stuff ! i bought extra battery take trips . one battery typically lasts me 2 days shooting , long i don't much reviewing my shots through camera monitor . unless you need quality 1ds immediately i would recommend getting 10d because technology moving so fast quality 1ds available current price 10d near future	1
i also received this remote only international warranty . i called amazon they immediately sent me out replacement free charge ; yeah . but alas , it too international warranty ; @#$% !. i returned both , unopened unused their dime . perhaps this only version they	1

like most every canon accessory , 580ex well made very expensive . i cheaped out when i bought my digital rebel bought sigma ef-500 dg , which represented " almost good " canon 580ex . appears true . problem " almost " leaves me no master/slave lighting . so when i picked up eos 30d , i bit bullet paid big bucks canon . it works advertised nicely makes sigma slave it really born	1
i feel these filters not required if you digital camera coze you you what ever you like computer graphics programs only uv protector important	1
... it diffuses light energy flash different directions , essentially turning flash into point light source . light going off different directions then bounces off nearby objects fill shadow areas subject , making more pleasing softer look , especially people . note caution : because this device diffuses light flash , it takes much more energy per flash . using stofen drain your battery much quicker ( 4x my experience ) it takes flash much longer fully charge after each shot , say 8-10 seconds vs 2-3s . always keep spare set flash batteries you . note ... because it requires bouncing light nearby objects effective , using this outdoors not recommended . you're better off removing omni-bounce aiming flash directly subject ( living harsh lighting ) .	1
this my lens handheld images birds flight . it sharp exhibits no color fringing or other chromatic aberration . comparison , my leitz 400mm f/ 6.8 telyt shows fair amount color fringing outside center region . fair , telyt much simpler design . telyt higher contrast than ef 400mm f/4 , but levels layer photoshop fix . 400mm f/4 much lighter than any 400mm f/4 lens conventional optics . lenses diffraction element compensates color dispersion spherical lens elements . it also reduces optical complexity size . f/4 speed makes autofocus faster , allows even better isolation subjects using narrow depth field . while bigger heavier than canon 400mm f/ 5.6 , f/4 lens light enough 4.3 pounds it still easy carry . i've used mine hikes above 10,000 feet photograph bighorn sheep . definitely makes difference handheld , tripod below 1/125 second . canon 400mm f/ 5.6 non-stabilized lens . i've taken some my sharpest wildlife images this lens - you see every feather some bird shots . highly recommended if you afford one .	1
photos excellent . but photo print quality depends very much print shop . same photo file , it look like 4m photo when taken below quality printer shop . photos taken indoor marginal lighting ( no flash used ) turned out yellowish . battery life very long despite its large 3 " lcd . battery charging time over 3 hours - too long . photos files viewed computer looks just great . 8'x10 ' prints great but not tried larger prints . touch screeen control delight very easy choose set . date photo red ( would better if it black ) . location date not far right hand corner	1
good quality filter set great price . i so happy it i purchased sets all my lenses cameras ! same filters my local camera store more than double price	1
if you big lenses ( 400mm f/ 2.8 usm or even 70-200mm f/ 2.8 usm ) this totally worth addition . 2x not kill autofocus f/ 2.8 effectively doubles your lens very little distortion around edges . check compatability canon website . you won't disappointed	1
this high quality extender great addition my canon ef 70-200 f/4 !! top-notch build quality tough , weather resistant design equal their highly respected line quot ; lquot ; lenses , canon produced great product its unbeatable zoom lens !! although 2x extender renders a/f function useless many canon cameras , i found this very small drawback overall ( i prefer manually focus under many my shooting conditions ) . this extender more suited low f/number lens due 2-stop change brightness , but it still very effective my f/4 normal lighting . lightweight fairly inexpensive way double your focal length , while maintaining incredible optical quality main lens ... my backpack always contain my 2x 1.4 extenders !	1
i am professional photographer , i owned this camera nearly two years . i also d70 backup . batteries go forever , it very quick respond , images beautiful , it typical nikon durability reliability . if you already nikon user , controls fall easily hand . said , computer software this camera joke . best image quality shoot raw files , color balance grey card , render images software like capture one le . uselessness included software only reason this camera gets four instead five stars . come , nikon , real !!! shortly after i got my first d70 , i shot model small photo side bar catalog . i got ugly feeling my gut when i told designer taken shot 3/4 figure , cropped head shoulders , enlarged image cover 8.5 11 catalog . time i found out , it already printer . it turned out , i pleasantly surprised : cover shot looked great . after incident , i trusted this camera always pleased results . this camera better than 35 mm every way except response shutter button . resolution color reproduction it more comparable medium format film camera . it imperative shoot raw process files properly get most out this camera . i can't wait try d80	1
excellent camera kit . versatile . i lot learn camera , though , it no simple point-and-shoot . however , auto mode , it takes great point-and-shoot pictures . i look forward learning how use it fully . lenses came warranty cards , but camera itself not . i bought sb-600 flash well battery two 1 gb compact flash cards round out kit . camera lens attached large , which i underestimated . $80 camera bag too small it all . great camera , though . price best i could find anywhere	1
i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camea , its beyond description ...	1

this camera really great . i knew i liked it before , but i immediately began appreciate this camera all more when i ended up rebel xt " loaner " while my 20d repair . not xt bad camera , it just doesn't really compare 20d . 20d nice feel it ; it fairly large , which great since i somewhat large hands . features great too . image quality awesome . i don't really need go into all details , most other reviewers excellent job . let me just say it great camera worth five stars . only complaint i camera it doesn't spot metering . ability your light metering off single point interest would great - they add it 30d .	1
i delighted quality pictures i get this lens . autofocus fast quiet , while manual focus very solid smooth . i'm finally taking pictures worthy jewelry my partner creates	1
i bought this lens little over year ago macro shooting . i quickly found out , however , shoot macr o-o nly this lens crime . it very versitile lens . its fast f/ 2.8 aperture makes good shooting low light . i pretty much use this outdoors 100mm 1.6 crop factor my rebel xt eliminates most indoor oppurtunities . i frequently use this lens family portraits , resultant photo so crisp clear bokeh really helps add snap primary subject . others stated , this heavy lens . it doesn't image stabilization ( ) so tripod or monopod great accessory get best images . i use beefy monopod my best shots , although i lot handheld gems ... if you tight cash , this isn't " one lens " it all . if you looking versitile lens outstanding macros portraits , this lens .	1
this fantastic lens not only macro shots but portraits too . extra distance allows far more flexibility when out . tried both 50 , 60 100mm - i'm glad i went 100mm	1
walkaround lens . this very topic leads heated discussion among dslr photographers . first , determine your budget , focal length , aperture needs . if you frequently find yourself zooming out get everything frame , you want wide angle lens such this . if you frequently find yourself zooming , this not lens you . full frame body such canon eos 5d , this lens becomes ultra wide angle . aps-c crop body such digital rebel xti ( which i used this review ) , it becomes medium wide angle . but thanks 1.6 crop factor , this lens expands more usable 35mm equivalent focal length 27 64mm . second , audition lens if you . definition , walkaround lens should relatively portable . 1.1 lbs ., canon ef 17-40mm f/4l usm neither super light nor neck breakingly heavy . fact , it weighs almost same digital rebel xti -- really nice balance . lens feels very solid supreme build quality only l-series lenses offer . although this lens weather proof therefore sealed against liquid dust , i strongly recommend getting 77mm filter protect front lens element . it , this lens made last . terms looks feel , it doesn't get much better . its rubberized full-time inner focus manual ring usm focuses smoothly , quietly , quickly . since it inner focus , lens not extend beyond its metal casing whether you zoom or out . focus window shows focusing distance 0.28 meter ( 0.92 feet ) infinity . focal length marker indicates 17 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 35 , 40mm . lens exudes quality tip tip . you may tolerate heavier lens or may not mind lesser build quality cheaper lenses . walkaround lens used very often , so make sure you comfortable i t.t his lens famous saturated color deep contrast . its images simply stunning . 17mm wide angle , barrel distortion noticeable but relatively mild . 24mm 40mm , its images distortion free perfectly suited capturing people . vignetting ( corner darkness ) minimal mild chroma abberrations ( color shadows ) . f/4 aperture , details become noticeably softer toward edges . center region very sharp f/ 5.6 , edges remain fairy sharp . thanks 7 diaphragm blades , this lens produce very nice bokeh 40mm ( blur effects ) . one most cited weaknesses f/4 aperture . my experience , bump iso speed steady hands all you need take well focused images indoor . other hand , if you shooting very little amount light , you might wish f/ 2.8 or image stabilizer . although difference f/4 f/ 2.8 just 1 stop , my other lens , canon ef 24-70mm f/ 2.8 usm ( too heavy my walkaround lens ) easily outperforms such challenging situations . but large , i not handicapped f/4 aperture . some main competitions ( sorted price ): - sigma 18-50mm f/ 2.8 ex dc : arguably best wide angle lens limited budget . focus mechanism bit slow , corner very soft , chroma abberrations bit issue , lens highly prone flare . works only ef-s mount . - sigma af 17-70mm f/ 2.8 - 4.5 dc macro : bit more expensive than sigma 18-50mm , but wider focal range macro capability . - canon ef-s 17-85mm f/4- 5.6 usm : this " traveler lens " wider focal range than most wide angle lenses ( widest among canon ) equipped image stabilizer . but lens famous extreme barrel distortion 17mm chroma abberrations . works only ef-s mount . - tamron sp af 17-50mm f/ 2.8 di ii ld aspherical ( if ): this most direct competitor . it takes sharper images faster aperture while costing less . both build focus mechanism significantly worse , but should good enough many . works only ef-s mount . - canon ef-s 17-55mm f/ 2.8 usm : this reference , if you afford it . its images razor sharp details great performance all around ( minus vignetting , which typical ef-s lenses ) . build quality worse than l-series but not too shabby . works only ef-s mount . this best ef-s lens hands down . - canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 usm : one most expensive wide angle zoom lenses . it larger heavier , but f/ 2.8 aperture . this how canon ef 17-40mm f/4 usm stacks up . pros : - among very best build quality . - excellent , buttery smooth , super fast front-focus system . - top notch color contrast . very sharp center resolution . - almost non-existent vignetting , generally low distortion , well controlled chroma abberrations . - ideal weight size walkaround purposecons : - edge softness f/4 aperture . - narrower focal length than most competing lenses . - slower than some third party lenses . all all , this excellent wide angle walkaround lens . it may not offer most bang buck , but if you value full frame compatibility ( ef lens mount ) excellent build quality , this default choice . this lens comes nice pouch lens hood . i find hood somewhat ridiculously shaped because lens resistant flare , i not use it often when shooting outdoor	1
i am really glad i bought this lens . it comes hood which reversed when not use so it very useful . leather pouch , front cap , back cap included . focusing super fast usm .	1
may i introduce you one least know yet most superb lenses canon makes . you probably even stumbled this page accident , looking canon lens , looking various macros , or even just intrigued this higher-priced lens you've probably never even considered . let me just say this this lens : ultra sharp . ultra colorful . ultra contrast . ultra solid . like everybody else , i initially bought this lens its macro . 60mm 100mm options lot cheaper , but my collection entirely l-class i'd learned trust putting gobs money into lenses red ring . so i put my money where my l-faith went this lens . needless say , my faith rewarded again . yeah , sure it got 1.0 macro capability , this important . but what i wasn't expecting image quality . it unbelievably good . now i'm not somebody who taking his first trip into land comparing this lens $300 run-of-the-mill glass . i've used six l-class lenses significantly i'm comparing this lens ' image quality those . you find yourself using this lens much its 180mm focal length f/ 3.5 aperture dictates . lens versatile both super-fine telephoto 1.0 macro . macro capability main feature . 1.0 macro literally means 35mm wide object completely fill 35mm frame . basically , it small microscope . if you dare dial aperture wide-open f/ 3.5 , dof approximately thickness two sheets writing paper 1.0 . needless say , you'll need tripod , preferably macro rails slide forwards rearwards ultimate control . ( those you new macro , focusing lens changes magnification factor . so one focuses object , object size viewfinder changes . this why i mention macro rails , they allow you achieve focus physically move lens/camera out reachieve desired composition . ) telephoto , due this lens ' superb image quality , it actually produces images much greater quality than 70-200mm f/ 2.8 . ( i know firsthand , i own it too ) difference 70-200mm versatility . if light drops too low , f/ 2.8 bests f/ 3.5 quite rapidly . if distance subjects change quickly or you unable move your feet frame images , 180mm too constricting zoom win . but under conditions where 180mm f/ 3.5 perform unhindered ( such airshow or out flower hunting ) , it consistantly produce brighter , more saturated , sharper images than 70-200mm f/ 2.8 . there complaint circulates slow speed which this lens autofocuses , expecially annoying when trying used telephoto . this actually incorrect . lens ' autofocus drive infact move very quickly , but it must traverse all way infinity 4 " front lens find subject . this where wait time comes into effect . here solution : utilizing af limiter switch allows you limit af search only infinity 5 ' front lens . consequently , this range 10% focus range ( other 90% 5 ' 4 " ) . i no longer experience af " hunting " problems when trying use 180mm telephoto . some other info this lens : front objective element actually concave . i think this only lens canon makes concave front element . it probablyexpensive replace if accident should occur , so utilize uv filter ( 72mm filter size ) . i recommend only b+w or hoya multi-coated brands . ( yes they're pricey , but worth it)the hood this lens actually little too small my opnion . if shooting backlit object , i sometimes get heavy orange glow viewfinder soi am forced use my hand " hood extender " block sunlight . its size , this lens relatively lightweight . it much lighter than 70-200mm f/ 2.8 easily handholdable extended periods time . this lens compatible canon extenders . i personally used it 1.4 extender . results excellent . while ca sharpness degrade noticeably 70-200mm , this lens shows barely difference image quality , except change designation 252mm f/5 , course . add fact macro capability now gone 1.0 1.4 , big bonus . so whom this lens apply ? -those who neither macro or telephoto prime who desire single piece handle both aspects excellent results . -those who plan performing professional product photography . -those looking into serious nature photography ( packing this lens wide-angle pretty much all you'll need day hike ) . what this lens not well : -low-light photography . -event photography . -landscapes . alternatives : -60mm/100mm : lesser image quality , less telephoto compression macro images , no real double-duty telephoto , but whole lot cheaper wider aperture . -mp-e 65mm : much greater magnification ( 5.0 ) , lower image quality , no telephoto capability , odd design means studio use almost exclusivel	1
canon lenses known their great optics priceyness . this fast tele excellent value . only thing would improve this lens would addition image stabilizion feature found few canon optics . course , advantage large aperature lenses you set fast shutter speed still enough light shot . this lens surprisingly compact , ( long focal length teles go ) . autofocus very fast quiet . comes hood , too .	1
this set basic filters must every camera bag ... even new slr users find them easy use they enhance your pictures - without doubt	1
if you intermediate level photography need camera bag strong comfortable this bag may you . i fit my canon s2is , adapter , two filters or lens this bag . this all i expected what i read this product . if you slr multiple lenses ,,, sorry ,,, you spend more bucks bigger bag .	1
i love bag all reasons others not like it . product listed gadget bag what it good . s2 large camera point shoot it fits very few bags . this bag fit camera easily space all types extras including batteries , chargers extra media cards . there also enough room small digital camera or film point shoot . correct way advertise this case would up two bodies or four small lens . given limitation , this great bag . bag very well made holds my canon powershot s2 very securely . i lay camera it back means even if i accidently power it lens opens harmlessly . material great waist belt very practical . strap well padded after day use i believe it one most comfortable straps i used . buy this bag correct camera you very happy it .	1
70-200 f/4 loved it pieces d60 , now 1d mkii , but sold 4.0 order pay 35-350 , which my work horse . due push pull feature however , 35-350 gets dusty quick good ol ' montana land , so it go cleanings every once while , f/stop isn't always desirable certain situations . 70-200 f/ 2.8 amazing . twist zoom little close camera , so it takes some twisting wrist get it where you need it , imho , bit too much turn 70 200 time one might need extreme sports . ( rodeo , nascar etc ) clarity this piece glass just blew me away . i comparison images my 70-200 f/4 when it new , 2.8 still visibly sharper . i put expensive filter it , my equipment asked lot very harmful conditions , i notice slightest big distortion filter , even though it good bw ..... so when i , i shoot lens no filter if i require extreme detail . 35-350l nowhere near quality this little 2.8 ... if it weren't difference distance , this lens would my one only . oh , i love . it my first lens , i treasure , but know i not buy distance lens without it	1
i read reviews this lens no one anything bad say it . it fast , crisp , focuses fast , quiet , solid bit heavy . weight vastly compensated all positive features . i used it my 20d just amazed . i just purchased 5d cannot believe my eyes . just great great lens	1
first thing make sure which lens you buying . kit lens comes canon 20d , 30d , 300d , or xt lower version , non usm one . higher version usm ones , you see red color " usm " front lens . according reviews , compare non usm ones , optically they same . however , usm motor focus faster much quieter . people complain build quality . actually i feel it really not bad , much better than canon 50mm 1.8 ii . usm auto focus performance fast , never hunt , much quieter than 50mm 1.8 ii . it fits nicely xt . not compare this hundred dollar lens other lenses cost three times or more . we compare apple apple . if you know limitations this lens use it wisely , images come out nicely . 1 . this not lens indoors low light conditions . if you need take lots indoor pictures flash not allowed , go get different lens . ( example , i use canon 50mm 1.4 this kind situation . ) 2 . distortion 18mm quite bit . avoid taking strait lines ( like buildings ) pictures edge while wide open . however , this easily corrected computers . 3 . step down aperture f8 or f11 , resolution improved lot even corners . overall , performance very good hundred dollar lens . it very light weight highly portable while traveling . this fits my needs cheap but fast good image quality walk around lens .	1
i chose purchase this lens over standard 18-55 comes kit xt . it functions smoothly seems worth difference definitely upgrade .	1
i purchased this lense novelty inexpensive 1.8 lense . i use this low light sport situations like basketball or volleyball - especially gymnastics where flash not allowed . i'm not huge fan locked into focal length , but anything under 2.8 you don't choice . this definitely not primary lense indoor sport shooting , but it fun companion when you need speed 1.8 indoors	1
i no investment dslr but narrowed my choices canon 30d nikon d200 . i always wanted nikon . d200 definitely joy hold it take good pictures ( i tried both camera store before i bought 30d ) . i lot research ( more than i care admit ! ) there no conclusive evidence one camera clear edge over other . depending your specific needs , one camera may " slightly better " than other . after trying out both cameras , i convinced 30d good fit my needs d200 . " value money " 30d clear winner over d200 ( i got mine when canon cash canon promotion going ) . also , beginner slr i found 30d its fully automatic scene modes easy start out . i don't expect use scene modes or full auto mode after week or two . i expect quickly graduate creative control zones . but use family camera , quick scene modes very helpful . if you expect use it more professional basis it'd probably not matter . additionally , when i checked it out store , i noticed canon 30d focused sharply almost every time . d200 not least few times . i'd take this grain salt though since it brief trial store . but i thought i'd share my experience . it may just anomaly actual equipment i tried out . i still find nikon d200 great camera ? absolutely ! i regret bought canon 30d ? absolutely not ! decision swinger my case really " money factor " . i more than willing spend up $300 more nikon d200 . but when difference became $550 it no longer became justifiable my christmas gift myself :-) my purchases included canon 30d [ ... ] , canon 17-85mm ef-s usm lens [ ... ] , sandisk extreme iii 2gb compact flash card [ ... ] i plan add external flash this soon , consider eventual lenses after i determine camera long-term keeper .	1
i am so pleased this camera ! there really nothing negative i think say it ! i also own cannon xt . i use both wedding photography well family portraits i am so impressed color quality d30 ! well cannon	1
those who truly know digital cameras , more than perhaps 8 megapixels important only if you plan blowing your images up " poster size " , or if you pro who knows how use all those pixels . truthfully , how many you really plan type stuff ? say rebel xti better than 30d because it " more megapixels " " smaller " not best advice . any canon dslr going give you great images , if know how use it . those you who trying decide which camera buy , you really need go camera store ask handle each camera . while you're it , ask yourself how it feels your hands . it too bulky ? it too small hard handle ? it features you want such spot metering , which rebel xti not ? 30d terrific dslr . it all features 99% us need . there reason why it costs more than rebel . 30d better camera overall .	1
excellent product works well . made canon ef28-135mm lense . reasonable price	1
i bought generic chinese " equivalent " bp-511 battery boasted higher milliamperage rating cheaper price than original canon battery came my camera . battery worked fine 3 months now only holds charge 20 minutes . i it fail critical times . never ever buy some knock-off chinese battery -- read reviews . chinese push out their crappy knock-offs unsuspecting consumers ( like i ) just make quick buck . also , don't trust glowing reviews generic sellers . they self-generated . my case , seller no longer selling under his original company name . he new name requisite ( sham ) glowing reviews . chinese products suck	1
some reason , canon- branded batteries better than those sold actual battery manufacturers . don't just look $$/mah ratio , consider safety , reliability longevity . these categories , canons rock . i bought g1 camera five years ago , camera toast , but battery still works like charm my 20d . others start out 1400 or even 1700 mah , but fail after six months - read reviews here amazon.com	1
i purchased this my new canon 30d dslr . i mainly use it fills outside sunny days , but it used light up situation . i'm personally still learning how best angle light get best outcome , but i don't think it'll take long	1
job canon e-ttl ii nice feature but i wish they would provide battery indicator like canon dslr cameras	1
excellent flash use my canon 20d fantastic price , canon 580ex expensive option , but should i buy one future ? 430ex perfect slave unit . great product canon always	1
this lens amazing . nothing escapes it . it like black hole . clearly best lens i ever owned . it like lidless eye sauron lord rings . it heavy requires rethinking how you hold camera . it comes beautiful case , hood , tripod mount lens . believe me you need it . i took few photos my son 250 feet away they look great . i now get work reading small manual . it 2 focal settings 2 stabilizing settings . wow !	1
i agree all others comments this lens . it works great but it big , heavy attracts attention . when i say it attracts attention , i am not kidding . i airshow taking pictures lot other amature photographers . my 100-400mm lens , however , attracted attention local newpaper reporter who interviewed me . however , i bought it use my 20d airshows i honestly say i am not disapointed . it well worth money . i also bought cheap kenko 1.5 teleconverter kicks . while converter isn't " " grade , i am pleased results autofocus still works which i understand not case canon tcs . those looking big zoom lens you want , you ulitimately going wind up buying this lens .	1
i shoot canon 20d used canon ef 75-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 iii usm lens . i've always noticed limitations this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed lens lineup canon website decided canon ef 100-400mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 usm lens . even so , i apprehensive push/pull zoom system . since this lens seems so expensive , i wanted try it before i bought it . after renting lens using it over weekend softball tournament , i knew this right lens me . this serious lens meant serious photographers . lens , there lot more features manufactured better materials . construction sturdy consists 17 elements 14 groups . fluorite super ud-glass elements largely eliminate secondary spectrum . this lens compatible extenders 1.4 ii 2x ii . canon ef 100-400mm lens weighs 3 lbs/ 1,380 , accepts 77mm filters . sure get good quality uv haze filter . white , this lens looks bit strange , but helps keep it cool when using sun . some people concerned white , it attracts attention criminals . my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless what lens i put it . i personally doubt thief looking something steal taking time evaluate cost item more concerned ease taking something they unload . i try make things difficult would thieves insurance back up . dual system two modes . mode 1 stationary subjects while mode two moving subjects . it recommended function not used tripod ; however i used it my monopod success . helps eliminate camera shake helps stabilize lens when shooting moving vehicle . while there limitations what , it give you couple extra stops . just keep mind , attempts eliminate camera movement , not movement subject photographed . this lens permits auto or manual focus depending how switch set . there also switch shift 1.8 m/ 5.9 ft infinity or 6.5 m/ 21.3 ft infinity . zooming this lens takes little time get used if you never used it before . once it gotten used , it seems much faster than typical twist zooming . resistance ring used tighten or loosen resistance zooming . this allows practically locking zoom place or providing no resistance all . zooming simple pulling or pushing lens its name sugges t.t he push/pull system causes air noticeably pushed around . because air pushed into camera , there myth lens causes dust settle accumulate digital camera sensors . i mostly use this lens one dirtiest environments i shoot amateur softball pictures . even so , my experience not support myth . i not seen any evidence support myth any reputable source either . included this lens tripod mount , lens hood , storage case . tripod mount best option use when mounting tripod . this helps balance load . mounting camera instead creates unbalanced set up may topple over . case zippered soft case ( lz1234 ) also purchased separately . lens hood ( et-83c ) used reduce lens flare protect front element certain situations . canon ef 100-400mm such awesome lens , it almost fails compare canon ef 75-300mm . clarity sharpness incredible . auto-focus quiet quick . features add creative versatility . canon ef 100-400mm comes price , but it worth every bit it . now i both lenses , canon ef 75-300mm no longer used . pros : incredible clarity sharpness quiet quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual system cons : heavy bulky ( this should expected these types lenses	1
i purchased lowepro slingshot 200 replace tamrac adventure 7 backpack i recently returned amazon . i spent quite few hours researching bags use sightseeing/hiking initially purchased tamrac bag b/c its similarity ( style ) regular backpack . recent " series " purchase encouraged me keep low profile when transporting my gear . while tamrac bag certainly looked part , its functionality left something desired . adventure 7 held my entire kit , which includes : canon digital rebel xt , ef24-105mm " " , ef50mm ef18-55mm " kit " lenses , ex580 flashgun various hoods/filter/etc above lenses . now bad part , once strapped into its normal position , only way access your gear ( adven . 7 pack ) fully remove backpack , place it ground , unzip zipper fully , then remove/replace camera/gear you desire . this proved very cumbersome while rocky terrain " great falls " national park va ( near dc ) , fact , there times when i gave up few nice photo opportunities simply b/c getting camera would too difficult . i own lowepro holster , but going route , i would limited my ability bring alternate lenses/accessories . after some additional research , i decided try slingshot 200 . let compare tow some key points : gear capacity : nearly identical both bagsadditional capacity : tamrac trumps lowepro , it nearly double useable storage capacity , great bringing snack , your keys , etc . styling : again , tamrac winner , looks like standard backpack , versus strange look slingshotfunctionality : backpack , tamrac much more comfortable , greater storage capacity even offers waist support strap longer trips . but , this comes cost accessibility . lowepro slides easily around front . simply unzip your camera right there . it also stable platform lens changing/cleaning/etc . summarize : hiking/walking/etc where you need instant access your camera accessories , lowepro slingshot 200 wins hands down . pros : instant access your gear , includes all-weather cover ( attached ) , nice attention details ( lens cleaning/protection cloth particularly nice touch ) , etc . cons : strange styling , not reversible ( only worn right shoulder ) , nearly impossible carry hanging one shoulder .	1
if you believer protecting your expensive lens purchase filter than you lot worse than tiffen filter . glass quality good price reasonalbe . filter cuts down glare adversly effect some shots out uv filter advertised . not much else say .	1
uv filter standard filters get . tiffen makes good quality filter this just expected . price equilivant other vendors expected i no problems ; ordering simple product came time	1
after using both lenses i think this much better . here my reasons : 1- 2.8 makes autofocus much faster accurate . 2- bokeh much better this one . 3- macro slightly better this one . 4- 105 mm make very little difference image size . 5- not very crucial 24-50 range .	1
you buying quality not price . im amazed quality pictures i get my new lens . it seems i changed my camera new model ... totaly diferent pictures . i compared my previous cameras lenses wow ... i cant believe i thought i some great pictures my collection . i dont want use my other lenses anymore , i new standard my pictures . i say it " crazy " decision buy this lens because price , but this investment once you it you enjoy last many years . if you love photography really like go full detail you wont regret it	1
this terrific lens , my new favorite . excellent feature ; i wish all my lenses it . even 2x teleconverter , it rock steady viewing shooting . my images sharp tack great contrast color . i'd pay three times this much get any better telephoto images	1
after debating this 70-200 series i decided purchase this lens . i pleasantly surprised results . i also own 17-85 50mm 1.8 lenses i found i gotten " most pleasing " results this lens . pictures very sharp my 20d - even 200mm - 300mm range . i've also happy quality bokeh . primary drawback i see af tends hunt fair amount when confronted low contrast images . said , i used it some flying bird shooting wildlife refuge surprised see how many shots sharp focus . however , it little bit all or nothing . several shots also wildly out focus . since lens fairly slow focus , you never know what you're gonna get such fast moving object against distant sky . i much more consistent results when shooting soccer , softball football park . af speed not present issue any these activities results excellent . i wish lens little less expensive but i prints i gotten my 13 19 printer worth extra money	1
1.4 ii teleconverter modest update canon earlier 1.4 tc . mark ii allows this extender stacked canon extenders ( either 1.4 ii or 2x ii ) without separate two extension tube ( although loss sharpness stacking extenders may not acceptable you ) . otherwise , quality newer 1.4 ii supposed very similar older model , which i've never owned . 1.4 ii great way extend reach compatible lenses . note not every canon lens compatible this extender . following canon web site : " this tele extender used fixed focal length lenses 135mm longer ( except 135mm f/ 2.8 softfocus lens ) , ef 70-200 f/ 2.8 , 70-200 f/ 2.8 , 70-200 f/ 4.0 , 100-400 f/ 4.5 - 5.6 zoom lenses . " i use it frequently my canon 70-200mm f/ 2.8 , which turns it into 98-280mm zoom . extra reach it adds not tremendous , but it very welcome when i just need little more than what lens alone give me . i've found no appreciable loss sharpness using 1.4 . course , any extender going reduce sharpness some degree , but normal examination , i can't distinguish photos taken 70-200mm use 1.4 those don't . fact 70-200mm f/ 2.8 very sharp lens begin helps this department . using 1.4 decreases your lens ' widest aperture ' capability ' one stop . some lenses , more significant than it appears surface ; when using non-pro canon body ( such my 20d ) lens must minimum wide-open aperture ' capability ' f/ 5.6 autofocus work . lens doesn't set f/ 5.6 , it just ' capable ' least f/ 5.6 after adjusting one stop loss 1.4 . means some camera/lens combinations , adding 1.4 force you focus all your shots manually . ( note : there known ' fix ' this restores autofocus . i've never needed try it , but it involves taping over some connector pins 1.4 fool camera body . proceed caution if you try this , google search learn how it right before attempting it . ) 1.4 also reduces focus speed very slightly . i've only used it my 70-200mm , which canon usm fast-focusing lens begin , but decrease speed so slight i really don't notice it . it not affect ( image stabilization ) all . 1.4 built quality canon l-series lenses , which means it weather sealed keep canon pro body l-series lens weather sealed when used them . if you're considering this extender , you're probably also considering canon 2x ii teleconverter . i not own 2x but lot research it before ultimately deciding go 1.4 . 2x decreases your aperture two stops , reported noticable decrease sharpness -- more than some photographers willing live . other hand , i've never read review complained loss sharpness 1.4 . if you've already invested lot money telephoto lenses , 1.4 ii relatively inexpensive way get even more reach ( value ) out your investment while adding only modest amount bulk your camera bag . highly recommended	1
i am just hobbyist . this big purchase big step me get into this level camera . i still haven't mastered using it yet , i've it few months . it wonderful job taking pictures . if you right lenses , it take some most beautiful pictures you've ever seen . again , i'm just hobbyist/enthusiast . i use it take pictures work , too . i highly recommend getting couple very good lenses go it . don't go cheap lenses canon , tamron , sigma , etc . make this camera . yourself favor get nice zoom - spend some bucks . you'll happy you . camera itself pretty easy use if you leave it auto , but that like buying race car never shifting out first gear . auto settings great , they wonderful job , but you so much more if you learn use camera manual , av , tv , or mode . it allows you so much more creativity you'll amazed difference . 30d came out right before i bought 20d , i would probably buy it price now , but i'm very happy my 20d	1
this camera amazing , i couldn't asked more . just warned manual pretty terrible . it best just play around camera until you figure it out , rather than wasting time trying decipher manual	1
i initially bought this switch able take fireworks pictures my 30d tripod . it worked well this application . got some great shots fireworks . since used it some wildlife photos it works well this application also . cord camera switch only two feet long . sufficient use tripod , but perhaps just little short any other application switch . i consider it " overpriced " what it , but if you need manually operated remote switch , it performs this function well . release button option where you lock-it " " . it useful if you what leave your camera shutter open long exposure . i didn't research any other brands remote switches my canon 30d . there may others , but i hurry something before 4th july , just ordered it , since i knew suppose work my camera . it performs it intended design function . it overpriced , my estimation , but if you need one , this one perform job .	1
it simple , handy works well prevent shaking your camera . but i am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves 50 bucks ... this wired release would choice only if you not digital rebel user who more reasonable price option additional shutter button .	1
i lens , i cap .... its so long since i bought both i don't remember if cap came lens or not . surely it !!!!!!! i love my add lenses but i say now i've added all these other toys ( macro , wide angle , telephoto , filters ) i now realize i shouldve gotten slr digital held out true lenses instead conversion option . i love my s2is but just think how nice real camera would !!!!!! sigh ...	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1

i canon zr700 camera , it comes one this batteries . since it just giving me little more than hour recording , i felt i needed extra battery . when i saw options , because high price this product , i felt tempted buy oem battery that cost 16.00 usd shipping it good reviews other customers . but them i found canon bp-2l14 here amazon , which gives twice power only 56.00 usd , just 13.00 usd double power original product ( double size too , only bad thing it , but it really not much )	1
i bought this camera two years ago , pictures always perfect , even though sixth month it started getting stains everywhere , but then i found out it normal , not good but it usually happens this cameras . but worst all tha fact it displays error 18 ( e18 ) , lens gets stock camera won't work all . i searched google it , because user guide says nothing this error , then i read many reviews said there nothing it many canon cameras same defect ... i am really mad dissapointed canon , i never buy camera this brand , i wouldn't recommend it , unless you willing buy camera 2 years or less then throw your money trash	-1
i just finished semester brisbane , australia . i must say , retrospect , best thing i took me this trip this camera . she champ , definitely adventurous camera . thing cute hell yet solid like rock . i cannot remember amount times i dropped it sand , no negative consequences whatsoever . i even dipped it ocean mistake once ( not encouraged ) thing still works like charm . it also features like sepia weird flash makes lights something funny , making pictures wicked cool . outer covering shown wear , but it only helps acknowledge this camera take rough handling . people even comment this positive light , it become part my travelling gear . it also great scenic shots , panorama option . retrospect , it amazing buy , so affordable ( i'm backpackers ' budget) ! only because i seen amazing skies breathtaking scenery would i consider upgrading camera better pixelage . but if you staying hole-in-the-wall hostels or sleeping beach , you don't want expensive camera you . this thing great . battery life also great ( sake topping off cake )	1

i love this monopod ! i'm person who uses my camera nearly every day ( canon eos elan 7 35mm ) . this item one my favorite accessories camera -- so much easier travel than tripod ! it sturdy , but lightweight , easy use very portable . i am mostly using monopod support my camera enormous , extremely heavy 500mm telephoto lens attached . i'm actually able hold huge lens steady just monopod -- not one blurry photo ! i've dragged it all over bluegrass kentucky ... across fields horse farms , even racetrack . i've taken it out into wilderness photograph elk . i keep closing it down extending it out every time we got out vehicle , which often . also recently traveled all over arizona it grand canyon , monument valley , canyon de chelley , etc . i constantly opening closing it , taking literally hundreds photos ( 14 rolls ) no problems all . i'm wondering if other reviewer just got defective one . i wish i'd bought one these years ago ! i highly recommend it	1
i don't personally subscribe notion big brand manufacturers always make best lenses out there , but this one instance where they really , honestly . this thing lightning fast , sharp tack , bokeh much better than sigma equivalent , you'll hard time finding use your raw processor chromatic aberration correcting sliders when coupled digital body ( you still get some purple fringing around backlit subjects , but genuine ca bad enough show up print so far proven non-existent me any focal length or aperture ) . weight serious downside , but it one i live . if you're nature photographer who really problem holding still or if you plan using extension tubes , version might worth extra $700 you , but if you're doing event photography where subjects ones jumping around like rabbits , save your money your battery power ; ain't thing wrong this lesser model	1
i mainly use this when taking landscape shots where i want either make clouds pop or liven sky up some ( remember it works best 90 degrees sun . ) i also put it when shooting highly reflective vegetation or waterscapes would otherwise cause blown-out highlights . one other little secrete use this when shooting waterfalls since it allow you shoot slower shutter speeds thus increasing wispy waterfall look	1
it gave me option change angle light ... this nice option i am sure	1
first off this very nice lens money . i mine now three months love it . it great walk around lens 28-135 just right most pictures kids landscape pictures . it fast focus sharp clear pictures clear up 125 range gets little soft 135 but easily fixed little post editing . i taken most my pictures hand held works great . i even recommended it friend . i am using it 30d it spends most its time there . i am not sorry i purchased this lens taking lot more pictures it future .	1
this great ' only lens ' day . good weight vs capability handing most photo opportunities you'll come across . good price versatility function provides	1
this cheap lens - old design , very plastic - prove terribly useful those budget who want wider perspective , especially 1.6 crop factor dslrs . i learned " cheap " this lens - broke focus ring day after delivery . but i blame myself too , replacement given me no trouble , though i think my first one bit sharper than second . many standards , this lens match or exceed zoom lens comparable price ( prime lens should ) . autofocus little buzzy , but main time you'll notice when it loses its bearing suddenly lurches way off target . mostly , focuses quickly enough well . some chromatic aberration worst-case scenarios , but nothing awful or unexpected . vignetting , even 1.6 crop , noticeable , mainly sky shots , but gradual rather than sudden . ( might unacceptably worse full-frame camera . ) undue distortion seems minimal - haven't really checked but also haven't really noticed , if you see what i mean . flare seems average , perhaps better than one would expect such wide glass . bokeh nonchalant , not dreamy but never intrusive . but price , positives make up negative " average " tendencies . it vibrantly colorful contrasty almost fault . hard light little more challenging this lens , little more tricky balance exposure highlights shadows . it softish wide-open , but very unobjectionably - yet regret shooting f/ 2.8 . my main lens 50mm f/ 1.4 , switching back forth same aperture setting perfectly functional practice . lose little crisp taking four times much space , that trade-off i run . ( their filter threads match too . ) f/4 higher , i get " plenty sharp , " though i've never seen " unreal sharp " this glass ( i 50mm ) . " crop factor " over-simplifies effect mounting wide-angle lens 1.6 camera . yes , field view match 40mm full-frame , but perspective not , because you'll closer your subjects . shooting live subjects ( like bands , models , or street life ) require learning curve , so beware mission critical work before you've broken yourself so you anticipate its exagerations . said , i bought this lens primarily " head-to-toe " model shooting my modest studio , it real asset . interestingly , it tends toward very useful " slimming effect " makes hippy girls look more slender shorter girls more ambiguous height ( least " head-to-toe " distance them ) . disconcerting first but terribly useful once you've gotten hang it . ( beware chicken legs or reverse dramatic perspectives . ) i read every review i could find before purchase , this lens seemed magic middle higher cost clarity 20mm cheaper lesser sharpness 28mm . near i tell , i nailed it . this not spectacular lens , but very very functional one if you need affordable wider angle generally won't let you down	1

this camera looks amazing , not i ever money it . i am impressed this camera choice shoot feature film ! it used shoot tim burton corpse bride	1
i cannot say enough this camera ! moment you pick up box , you know you quality . construction materials used top notched . contents box found elsewhere , so i won't bother details . charging battery full takes 2hrs . if you memory battery repeated charges without complete depletion , you recondition battery included charger . it just takes 8hrs . while many lament fact no li-ion battery included , canon seems anticipated needs professionals field . one also option plugged into ac outlet not dependent batteries . reading manual takes bit time . camera endless customizable functions which overwhelming times . not it should deter you , but one rarely need all those functions anyway . using camera not seem too difficult . many functions need use two buttons , which may take some getting used . navigating through menu confusing initally , but improved time goes . autofocus speed responsive sharp . shooting high iso ( #62 ; 1000 ) minimal noise . looking some my pictures taken 1 fluorescent light room iso 1600 , appeared if flash used . photos my black lab incredible considering ambient light high iso . camera always ready go . if you manipulating within depths menu heirarchy , want suddenly take shot , just press shutter button , compose , focus , shoot . its quick responsive . incredible ...! some may wondering sizes pictures . jpeg 4 sizes range 1 - 2.8 mb ; raw files 8.4 mb . one take average 800 - 1200 shots full battery charge -- assuming one capacity hold it . prints my i9900 outstanding . cost pretty penny then some . also consider amazon authorized canon reseller . many rebates require you purchase authorized reseller eligible rebates . also , some internet deals camera not authorized resellers . overall , very impressive camera . cost many may prohibitive many . eos 20d may more cost effective alternative , but i not regret my decision one bit	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet .	1
i'm very happy product would recommend it my friends . your service also excellent	1

i am not professional photographer , but i wanted high quality lenses go my canon 10d ( which i may upgrade soon ) . i researched over month before purchasing this lens , i not disappointed . i only wanted carry around two lenses , so i purchased this one , canon-ef 17-40mm f/4l usm ultrawide zoom lens . i found this combination works very well me . my uses include photographing landscapes , wildlife , sports events , my family . speed quietness autofocus outstanding , zoom doesn't compromise quality prints . even though price high , you really get what you pay lenses .	1
this great lens . i not want repeat all good things other reviewers written this lens . it not so heavy so i use tripod without using tripod collar ( costs 119.99 ) . this best value i ever got lens . now i can't wait get 17-40mm f4l too . you get very nice bokeh when wide open f4 5.6 , course depending how far background subject . people complain how ugly hood looks but subjective . i like it because it works great you attach it reversed position lens so it fit your camera bag . i think fit finish lens beautiful	1
what difference , after using " standart " ef-s 18-55 kit lens came my rebel xt now this lens i finally see this really excelent camera but only if you use it excellent lens like this 70-200 f4 . great sharpness , color , solidly buit , obviously heavy but taking outdoors photos this one among best best	1
lens great ! i'm using it my eos 20d , shots beautiful . wide open setting ( 1.4 ) , depth field amazing provides absolutely outstanding boquet . this lens definitely worth difference price over 1.8 . boquet much better . little advice : avoid using auto focus your camera when using this lens ... its too easy catch any little thing front or behind what you intending focus , you see difference , just small difference depth . manually , lens provide you perfect shots every time ! its well worth extra few seconds make sure shot composed correctly	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
my take this lens it " " quality optic fine , non " " package . there nothing else market compete it ( nothing all ) , it produces supurb images . it isn't f/ 2.8 lens , but it close enough most uses . competition tamron full stop slower , not sharp , awful dim light compared canon 10-22 lens ( sorry , tamron fans , but tamron lens isn't even playing same ballpark ) . i use this lens 30d body , i always keep it hand if i'm doing any indoor , or tight group photography . it perfect solution perennial problem not enough room capture all kids birthday party one shot because your back up against wall . this lens just get your toes into picture widest setting , yet delivers tack sharp , colorful , contrasty images . auto focus spot , silent , fast . it must lens active amateur , or any pro using 1.6 crop factor camera . you simply can't beat this lens anything available market today . beng said , not try convince yourself this make good " walkaround " lens . it isn't . even max length , it far too short live your camera standard lens . you need this lens , even if you don't know it yet , but it should not your first lens , it only used 15 20 percent time . those times , it performance simply cannot equaled any other zoom lens 1.6 crop factor camera . you amazed quality this lens . it rivals performance modern prime lenses , presents bright viewfinder image , delivers goods tight situations . this not casual assessment , nor canon " feel good " moment my part . i developed my first bw contact prints 1964 , my own darkroom age 9 ( my parents concerned :)) , avid photographer ever since . small , medium , large format cameras lenses passed through my hands over years , canon become my favorite small format brand . still , canon builds some trash lenses should avoided . 10-22 usm not one them :) . before you go out buy this lens , you should already own ef-s 17-55mm f/ 2.8 lens . king 1.6 crop factor standard lenses , includes awesome canon feature . it end up mounted your camera 80% time , keep you smiling after every shoot . get lens first . then , get 10-22mm lens . then , let your imagination run wild , plan serious telephoto lenses future . trust me or not , two lenses mentioned above provide you photographic tools astound you . get them your kit soon you afford them . little warning either lens .... some here argue point , but either lens , get good quality uv filter multi-coated both sides , built extra thin avoid vignetting wide lens settings . good filter cost little less than one hundred dollars , cost up one hundred forty dollars . minimum brand would hoya pro 1 multi coated filters , ante goes up there . everything else garbage , including canon " sharp cut " filter costs less than fifty bucks . no kidding , no conjecture . if you use cheap filters , you never see what your lens really . ever . no doubt many respond claims their twenty dollar filter works just fine , but they simply don't know any better , never used their expensive equipment it full potential . it akin chevy owner passing judgement mercedes benz . chevy might feel real good , but until you own mercedes , you just no clue . bottom line .... make sure quality your filters exceed quality your lenses . yes , hundred bucks pop 77mm filter , it hurts , but you never regret it . also , amazon not stock lens hoods all non canon lenses . price stupid high those hoods , but they make night day difference picture quality . whenever you order non canon lens , find web seller who hood stock , get it right now . again , you never regret owning i t.t hat it my review/rant . buy this lens . buy 17-55 f/2 , 8 first . buy lens hoods both . toss any " kit " lenses came camera trash bin ( where they belong ) , very happy .	1
canon ef-s 10-22mm f/ 3.5 - 4.5 usm slr lens canon ef-s slrs ( like 20d 30d ) good all round lens though it soft 10mm . it only works ef-s compatable cameras which presently 1.6 multipliers so lens effectively 16mm 35mm . if you need shoot cramped spaces , or you shoot lots interiors you need wide angle , ef-s slr this lens required equipment	1
it very sharp lens . you wised use it extensively little children , they such clear faces . careful when you use this lens middle age women . it could show imperfecton thousand fold . again very sharp , very fast af focusing my nikon f80 . ecxelent portrature lens , but careful-women hate you unflattering portrature . my advise use black white film-you see less imperfection prints same rasor sharp focus	1
could not any simpler use . used it few times since it arrived it works flawlessly . +++ recommended all users . quicker easier than built charger zr700 camcorder	1
i really like this lens but my results not consistent . i think though this more function my limited skill photography . focal range seems very narrow but when you hit it results outstanding . i occasionally get images out focus but again i think this my fault . i bought this macro work but i use it prime lens most time	1
i never thought $250 lens could so good . i trying buy lenses light-weight my 20d , due neck injury problem , this 50mm fits bill . great low light , agree also , bokeh sweet . i alot bee chasing manage some great macros bees flight this one . all hand held . also take great indoor shots without flash , steady hand . i chose it also because it one least expensive high rated canon 50mm . it goes well inexpensive canon lens , 55-200mm ef 4.5 - 5.6 ii , which also well outdoors , including macro . i am very pleased both , wouldn't part them	1

hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shaped one three quarters inch long offers limited protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . so shallow petal shaped , even this type protection limited . even if protection limited , replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 24-105mm f/ 4.0 ef normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . this lens isn't unusually wide so extra inch may not problem . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image qualityreduces lens flare problemsoffers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store lenshigh price molded piece plasti	1
i surprised heft this tele converter when it arrived . it comes pullstring pouch offers reasonable protection camera bag , purse , or other similar carying case hold lens while attached required adapter . it also comes lens cap each end . converter high quality look feel throughout , lens hood included inexpensive adapter kit ( required ) , mounting threads cut accurately enough lettering lens hood all line up perfectly top assembly . it looks i would expect canon , which say , instrument quality . ok , looks don't make good pictures , so here rest story . body made tough , lightweight materials ( frp ?, polycarbonate ? ) , so what you feel when you take lens out case weight several glass elements . glass coating well , pictures nice contrasty . flare distortion minimal , par quality slr offering . base lens s2 fairly fast , doesn't suffer defects maximum telephoto , so this converter built complement quality , it fine job . matter fact , converter lens optimized supplement only telephoto portion main camera lens range , less than moderate telephoto settings , you end up view back end converter lens , not much else . used intended , it gives you ability use your 5 mp sensor take spectacular 650 mm telephoto shots incredible sharpness , color , detail . there no comparison digital zoom all . this lens alows you " reach out touch someone " while using every pixel your sensor available , without adding eyeball noticable distortion all . top , image stabilizer camera lets you shoot 650 mm telephoto pictures handheld reasonable lighting conditions . check out price 600 mm image stabilized lens slr get back me after you recover . sure , $ 5,000 slr body/lens combo win comparison lab bench , might stop faster ( only high end though ) , but s2/teleconverter combo lets you take far better more creative pics than classic 35 mm mirror tele lens ever offer . further cropping photos your computer later simply amaze you . price , it must item . it also catches action field movie mode nosebleed seats stadium . it big lens , make your s2 look though it must slr , but combination s2 teleconverter light enough ( compared slr ) carry all day long desert without problem . it offers digicam prosumer quality glass reach used reserved higher end slr . what it adds your photographic range , it cheap , o.o ne suggestion . lens adapter/lens hood combo you need mount any three converter lenses canon offers dirt cheap . combo sells around 26 bucks everywhere . adapter attaches camera push button release bayonet mount , quick change , feels very secure . adapter also takes 58 mm filters all kinds , i like keep uv filter mounted my camera improvement contrast it offers , protect camera lens damage ( i dropped my s2 this past weekend , hoya uv filter took fall . it dented , but didn't break ) . anyway , because they so cheap , i suggest getting one s2 , each converter lens you buy . way , you switch lenses instant , keep front each lens protected it own uv filter and/or hood . oh yes . good circular polorizer filter really kills glare , brings out contrast any lens under many typical shooting conditions . tele-converter lens not front threads mount filters ( most don't ) , but i made adapter mounting 72 mm uv filter 7/16 " long cardboard masking tape core inside diamerter slipped snugly over end tele-converter . prior gluing uv filter tube section , i painted tube flat black . now , circular polorizer ( or any other 72 mm filter attaches adapter , looks like it belongs there , works perfectly . i think you enjoy this converter much i . good shooting .	1
it easy attach -- detach -- works well most ( but not all ) my 58mm lens . it cut down glare , let face it , hood makes your lens look bit more dynamic , while also protecting it elements	1

i purchased this speedlight my d70s . it easy take out box fire up . but it capable lot more than your standard portraiture vacation shots . i using this unit in-store photography it worked wonders . included filters help balance out horrific fluorescent lighting found most stores . while it highly intuitive , i also control it outpu t.t his essential part any nikon package	1
here my point . when you buy digital slr , most likely couple years there newer model available some better features same price . but lenses well flashes not changing fast keep value much longer . so purely financial prospective , it always better invest more long lasting lenses flashes less dslr body . point . most people don't need all advanced feature modern flashes probably easily survive without them . but also almost everyone sooner or later finds him/herself situation , when place just too dark too big . so it more likely you'll need just more raw power then any advanced features . so bottom line , since general purpose flash usually long term investment , if you choice , try get most powerful one	1
i say , semi-pro photographer , this one item made vast difference many my shots . it allowed me get studio like shots ( extent ) without use those giant studio flashes cost thousands dollars . i able just set up few hot lights use sb-800 off camera thanks amazingly wonderfull wireless feature got great quality shots what i needed . also , concert photographer , low light areas this works great especially since most tour managers don't take highly flash use , it allows me farther back get great shot since i know little more fill light work . sb-800 i say far one few products you won't regret paying high price . i originally thought getting 600 decided go all out get 800 after reading all featuers it sb-600 doesnt . this product , coupled my d70 dr-6 right angle viewfinder ( great investment you should all look into ) give me so many great shots , i say only design flaw sb-800 i can't use dr-6 while flash camera unless i buy bracketing system . most time though , when i am useing dr-6 i am angle where pop-up works just fine but there few times i wish i could use 800 well . so those who unsure this sb-600 , go this product . now all i find better lens then my sigma 28-300 i am all set . anyone know where find good deal 18-200mm nikor lens ? if so someone ( if there way ) please email or contact me i myspace search my companyhope this helps least one personbradpremier image	1

i get frustrated all negative reviews this lens gets web . yes , af slow first generation . yes , it not totally sharp it slow long end . but what other $440 ( inc shipping ) 300mm lenses there ? * costs $1100 shorter but heavier optics not much better . * 100-400l costs $1400 , much larger just slow . * 70-200/4l 50% more expensive , only 200mm lacks . * new 70-300 replaces this lens probably better lens than this version but it costs 50% more currently ( oct 05 ) still not available us . 75-300mm my zoo lens so i don't use it nearly much my standard zoom everyday photography . my digital rebel its 1.6 crop factor this lens equivalent 120-480mm 35mm terms , image stabilization feature it makes some exotic optics . play this lens ' strengths ( middle aperture range [ don't afraid higher iso settings achieve this ] not extreme long end ) your images able printed 8x10 without issue . you're not going able easily track speeding cheetah this lens but not what this lens . it also unfair compare this lens series alternatives - if you afford series lenses then use them but don't cut those us down without your disposable income just enjoying this lens . if you own this lens you want improve quality your images remember always use lens hood . also , amazing but there limits ; monopod improve image sharpness no end . but both these tips apply equally most lenses both cheaper more expensive . this lens earned permanent place my camera bag . it cheap enough light enough carry just case you might need strong telephoto . really works really useful telephoto this kind zoom range . don't put off or intimidated lens snobs line counters . this lens also holds its value well ; buy it , use it , now while you're saving your dream telephoto you able sell it not much less than you paid it when time comes upgrade . when time comes you just might decide you want keep 75-300mm around well . this lens great value very useable even if it not great lens .	1
anyone considering this lens , according canon site , there newer model supersede this one which out perform it . item # 0345b002 70-300mm f/4- 5.6 usm lens available sometime 9/05	1
best camera i've ever owned . it features found larger slr such shutter speed red-eye reduction . several shoot modes such portrait allows close ups well scenery mode which allows sharp vivid photos foilage well sunsets . marvelous little camera size slightly bigger than pack cigarettes allows you take this anywhere without bulk some slr their required lens . too many features list here . try one yourself you'll amazed	1
pure image quality standpoint , this lens not please pixel peepers . wide end zoom , which i personally use more often than telephoto end , this lens not very sharp , it suffers fairly bad distortion . worse than , me , chromatic abberations ; this lens quite prone significant ca when shot wide end , which look lot worse than little bit distortion or softness . given price this lens , one should expect higher level optical performance . maximum aperture this lens not very large , f/4 wide end , f/ 5.6 telephoto end . image stabilization makes up this some , you comfortably shoot much slower shutter speeds than otherwise , but , let honest here ; this lens poor performer if you want shoot low light no tripod . small aperture makes dark viewfinder , which very big problem if you trying compose picture dark ( using tripod ) . yet , i still gave this very imperfect lens four stars , this not without reason . first all , focal length range quite handy . it isn't mega-zoom everything , however , it covers most often used focal length ranges , appropriate lens use vast majority situations . little bit extra zoom telephoto end handy occasion , it also worth noting lens sharpens up quite bit when you zoom some - it might soft wide end , but zoomed , it quite good . i printed large 20x30 " using this lens digital rebel , no qualms results . yes , there sharper lenses out there , but you lot more likely see difference sharpness your computer monitor than prin t.t his lens ring usm , which enables it focus very quietly , very quickly , whereas slightly cheaper ( 2.8 ) options 3rd parties normal focusing motors slow noisy comparison . if you want use this lens indoors , you best off getting flash go it , such 430ex . lens usable fantastic indoor lighting , or during day , but won't give you good results low light no flash . if you shooting lower light situations ( people particular ) , tamron sigma some good options 17-50mm range 2.8 apertures , i would recommend those lenses over this one . if you'd prefer extra telephoto range , image stabilization so you shoot smaller aperture poorer lighting situations greater depth field ( instead needing shoot landscape f/4 , instance , without image stabilization , you could use f/11 this lens , get sharp picture better depth field . this even more useful close focus range - while this isn't true macro lens , if you take closeup photos without tripod , you want stop lens down greater depth field , helps quite bit . overall , i've fairly pleased performance this lens . if you like worry splitting hairs , zooming all way pictures your computer , this lens likely dissapoint you . if , however , you willing sacrifice optical perfection get very well rounded , useful lens , then i'd recommend it , however , would also recommend you consider 3rd party options , they also great lenses , offer somewhat better value	1
if you only going buy one lens your 10 , 20 or 30d then buy this lens . i haven't seen better general purpose lens out there . ef-s 17-85mm takes great photos , especially action oriented situation where you need run around lot get variety different shots different distances . some complained lens overpriced . i agree price , it would nice get hood carry bag thrown , but i say canon impeccable warranty service . i got sand inside my lens autofocus quit while i shooting photos military helicopters landing iraq . i got lens repaired shipped back me within 30 days - baghdad middle war . i able speak human tech fairly easily they even replaced something i clearly broke through heavy use wasn't covered under warranty . repaired lens works perfectly . if you're looking reasonable alternative budget try this lens : sigma zoom super wide angle af 17-70mm f/ 2.8 - 4.5 dc macro autofocus lens canon digital slr camerasbear mind if you issues you're using non-canon lenses canon body , support you get canon limited	1
i purchased this tripod 47th street photo through amazon.com . tripod appeared arrive good shape , except operating instructions not included . i immediately emailed 47th stree photo customer service address printed flyer they included my shipment . i asked them if they would able send me copy operating instructions . they not respond my email , so few days later i emailed them again . once again , no response . i then emailed amazon.com, informed them missing instructions non-responses 47th street photo . no response amazon either ! far tripod goes , it appears very good value money . i gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because , due missing operating instructions , i cannot certain i properly checked out all its features . however , i am certain both 47th street photo amazon.com rate zero stars customer service . i use neither one again	1
i bought this tripod camera bag duo deal .... when they say professional , they mean professional . it large tripod , easy telescope out back again , but heavier longer , thicker than other tripods i've used . it appear well made very sturdy .	1
i received tripod ahead expected schedule . i've looking tripods stores around greater boston area . you can't get better tripod money . fact , you can't get anything " decent " under $40-50 even then i'm not sure you get something this good . i it shipped my job few guys office ( which i didn't know ) purchased tripod past where really impressed when i told them i only paid $25 it . conclusion : tripod perfect , no . head looks little like plastic . but it nice rubber feet rubber grip addition everything listed website . this tripod perfect beginner enthusiast photographer .	1
i'm loyal canon fan who only 4 canon branded lenses ( though i great sigma 70-300 ) .. said , i'm huge fan opteka grip . canon just not worth extra money . excellent build quality it , batteries it came work very well ( more mah than std battery ) . i heard some complaints how far you depress shutter release grip -- it further than camera , but very usable , since purchasing i've heard similar complaints users canon grip . save $ grip , get opteka get other accessories ... you wont regret i	1
i bought opteka battery pack grip my canon eos digital rebel xti , bit leary considerably lower price than canon brand battery pack grip . i am pleased report opteka grip met my expectations . prosthe grip fits extremely well rebel xti . it even comes convenient place store battery compartment lid ( which must removed insert grip into camera . removing lid easy procedure ) . attaching grip quick easy , large , serrated wheel tighten grip against camera bottom . finish grip different than canon-brand grip . opteka thin , rubbery , texturized non-slip insert layer over front , bottom back . canon grip rubbery insert smooth looks more " finished . " my only concern opteka insert it shows signs it may not stay perfectly attached grip , likely need touch cement future . not big deal , though . vertical shooting buttons grip ( exposure bracket , a-e lock , auto focus point selection , selector wheel shutter release ) , far i tell , identically placed like those canon grip . all work like they supposed . grip comes " on-off " slide so you turn off vertical shooting buttons when they not needed . this prevents accidentally activating one buttons or taking picture if they inadvertently pressed while shooting horizontal . battery compartment grip very easy remove insert batteries . although i haven't used it yet , optional aa battery insert looks easy use , good emergencies . two nb-2lh batteries came grip seem ok , charged up just fine . battery came camera , i now 3 batteries use . more than enough number pictures i take during typical shoo t.t he grip certainly improves handling feel xti , which comes too-small grip many hands . personally , i like additional heft mass opteka grip gives camera , although some may object additional weight . consthis very minor point , but worth pointing out . shutter release button opteka grip bit " mushy . " what i mean it not always easy tell when you pressed shutter releae halfway down activate auto focus or metering . there noticable tactile difference pressing shutter release down camera , shutter release grip . it if spring underneath camera shutter release button bit stiffer than one grip . however , if you use viewfinder determine whether you achieved focus or not , then little bit mush grip shutter release won't make no never mind . bottom linewould i recommend this grip friend ? yes . would i buy one if need arises ? yes	1
just sure get case it , because large screen could get scratched	1
i bought this camera two weeks ago , taken 100 pics , my battery still nearly fully charged . i thought i'd buy battery when i decided buy this camera , but i'm glad i held off , because it not necessary ( unless you're going two-week excursion bush no access electricity ... ) no problems red-eye , no blurry pictures when taken inside low light , outstanding battery life . i am getting more than i expected when i purchased this camera . i would recommend it ( show it off ! ) anyone	1
i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	1
i already digital rebel able sell it co-worker use proceeds my new rebel xt . faster , lighter , better . simple review . it took everything great my digital rebel made it better . some complain it feels " too light " ... ok ... it that your thing . me , it still solid pictures speak themselves . now , addition 10 mp rebel xt , i'll bet original xt purchased even better price . no downsides i think ..	1
clearly " rkm001 " some difficulty using this equipment . i one i used part my job . i probably cut over 1000 photos/labels/etc . other people office cut more than 2000 photos . it exactly what it supposed - it cuts straight line edge guide . where this problem arises when cutting surface , underneath cutting wheel , becomes worn use . i grove slowly develop since cutting surface not fixed position slide side side , grove not straight nor it parallel cutting guide . solve this problem , you should not use extreme force when cutting . gentle pressure adequate cutting photo . you also remove cutting surface rotate it 90 or even flip it over . this gives you four cutting surfaces work . ultimately you need replace it . carl makes those too . $20 , it works well unless you plan cut thousands times month , it fine home or light office use	1
it learning curve , that sure , but wow ! this camera worht every penny , far more stable then comparable canon rebel , product comes better lenses . quality glass matter	1
i taught photography college level , shoot 4x5 view camera work occasion , am very demanding image quality . i am quite satisfied image quality my kodak p880 , particularly after i installed newest firmware upgrade available kodak . i went through several 7mp 8 mp cameras before finally getting kodak p880 . p880 better image quality than some high end sonys olympus 7-8 mp cameras like dsc-v3 or sp350 . i tested p880 against even higher end 10.3 mp large sensor sony r1 difference image quality 13x19 print p880 r1 barely perceptible after minor sharpening noise reduction , which p880 images accept particularly well . zoom lens very useful range generally pretty sharp throughout its range . balance , manual controls features feel high end adequate most semi-professional needs . camera little slow processing storing pictures raw format exposure bracketing modes but really doesn't bother me because i mostly landscape fine art photos . raw file format directly supported most versions adobe photoshop photoshop elements well most other raw processing programs like bibble pro . unlike most sub-$500 cameras , p880 uses regular screw haze polarizing filters , real plus it highly controllable hot shoe . manual focus usable manual exposure control works well . direct mechanical zoom also nice . overall , p880 digital camera either high end point shoot slr-styled camera or one used fully manually most classic 35 mm film slr . although not small enough slip pocket , size still reasonable light	1
i bought this camera my work . i'm architect i looking camera wide angle lens interior photography budget wasn't going break bank . i looked kodak v570 , which 23mm fixed lens i seriously considering it but concerned durability reliablilty ( it seemed fragile ) . then i stumbled across kodak p880 ( kodak should really better job advertising their cameras ) , which comparably priced v570 . this camera next best thing digital slr , many same features . my wife canon rebel xt , which really great camera , p880 gives it really good run money regards features picture quality half price . i've this camera week putting it through its paces so far i very happy results . i would recommend this camera anyone thinking getting digital slr but hesitant slr price	1
i used my new nikon d200 this past weekend renaissance faire high heat , el3e performed like champ ( camera itself ) . i couldn't believe i got through three full days picture-taking ( using fill flash after five pm or so ) one battery charge . i finally ran out juice late third day , after approximately 500 exposures . ( one caveat : i don't use auto-focus . all . ever . so , you know , ymmv .	1
this excellent camera . i upgraded eos 20d which also great camera . i upgraded couple reasons . first full frame sensor . eos 20d 1.6 crop factor which effects your lenses overall focal length . eos 5d you get true focal length your attached lens . just like film slr cameras . awesome ! one problem i've noticed full frame sensor eos 5d it huge . when you changing lenses this sensor picks up every little piece dust , dirt fibers like vacuum . i'm constantly cleaning sensor blower . i also bring it canon service center . just remove some dust off sensor my blower could not remove . canon service center very far my home . ( very annoying ) . i never experienced this problem eos 20d . but , images you get full frame sensor far superior smaller sensor eos 20d . other reason i upgraded larger lcd . 2.5 ' lcd screen nice plus . images look bright sharp . overall i love this camera . build , features image quality excellent !!!	1
con:i've own this now 6 months , i shoot weddings portraits . i alot tests , especially picture modes . well don't waste your time these , their all bad , theexception landscape . you'll just end up using standardmode best all arround shooting . venetting accure arround edges , mostly low light . worst all color ballance or white ballance auto mode . what ever reason it hard time . my d60 out performs it here big time , not sure why . so you may shoota grey card get your white ballance more accurate . pros : quality pic excellent , color saturation awsome . blow up 2'x3 ' excellent detail , no noise . i've found focus mine real good , no problems here . ease use after learning curve becomes easy , just read manuel . conclusion : i would buy again except awb problem . now i owned both d60 10d neither seemed this problem bad . i use this mode when doing weddings because i'm always move go one differn't light sorce inbetween shots ( tungsten daylight ) . i still think canon best alway buy their products	1
i use this lens standard my rebel xt rather than 18-55mm lens came camera . it gives much greater flexibility outdoor shoots when i'm capturing my grandsons action soccer field .	1
this lens all i anticipated more . auto focus fast accurate . i gat stunning action shots	1
there no question paying $100 or more get you better monopod . but $16 sima smp-1 tremendous value . i sony dsc-w5 digital camera everything i think reduce camera-shake low-light photos . this monopod great adding stability making my photos less blurry . key it small enough light enough i take it almost wherever i go . because it so small , i bring it places would frown upon tripod . monopod not total replacement tripod . but this monopod now only addition my camera i take trips	1
this product served its purpose ; it same cord hooking up camera pc one came my camera	1
this cable four-point usb connector works some kodak digital cameras . sure your camera uses four point connector before buying this one . many cameras use five point connector . these kodak branded cables high quality fair price	1
i got this stuff gift friend mine . he seems happy using it . so i am giving this 5 star	1
i purchased this case my canon a530 camera . i find it great job light , durable , compact . it keeps camera clean scratch free . however i wish case better carrying capacity . i would liked bit more space spare batteries chips . i use different ones different pictures or video . batteries tend give out after long day shooting convient extras would handy . case beltloops but not good shoulder strap times when belt not worn . bit akward . otherwise this case good protector my camera fits it well .	1
i bought this camera when i sophmore college . now , 2 years out college , handfull beautiful days , half-dozen life changing moments , umpteen vacations later it still goes me everywhere snaps photographs . all sticker labels it since knocked off but it doesn't matter because i know what they all . this puppy built last . when i eventually pass this one down family buy new one , i'll getting canon sure . if you're looking high-value digital camera thinks it tank , get canon s100 .	1
i got these gloves use when taking outdoor photos winter . they work very well , little rubber grips help you better control camera without expose your hands elements . they not really warm enough really cold weather ( below 20 ) , but work well 20-50 degrees	1
i purchased this lens my canon eos 20d digital camera so far i really like it . it focuses fast produces very sharp , clear images . any longer lens you careful camera shake ; i've few images come out blurry but these usually interior shots . i really like 28-200mm focal length range find lens very versatile framing wide shots buildings or landscapes zoomed shots portraits or close detail shots . lens feels solid appears well constructed , which typical canon products . price range , this excellent lens . you only better spending considerable more money lens	1
we use it canon 300d . it gives good picture quality quick focus . become 44-320 300d . good buy	1
i needed more reach than 400mm gave my eos 1d , so i purchased canon 500mm f/4l three years ago . it incredibly sharp out corners f/4 . bird mammal portraits , you see every feather , every hair . lens light enough use wimberley sidekick . some claim able handhold it , but i think its eight-plus pound weight bit much . i carry mine long lens case backpack harness kinesis gear . this lens ' image stabilization works very well . i've used it tripod one-second shutter speeds good telephoto technique , gotten sharp , publishable images . eos 1d or 1ds , lens camera rain-proof mild storms . i also got mine through adorama , no problem delivery or post-sale advertising . if you buy one expensive long lens wildlife , choose this one .	1
amazon states ; product dimensions : 13.0 10.0 7.0 inchesthere no photo ( until i uploaded one ) so i thought this size stated , but turned out one little keychain bags 5x5 cloth inside . works fine , just not what i thought it , didn't want someone else think it large also . see my photo actual size next some keys . update 4/8/2006 i see they added photo what i thought i getting when i ordered .. see my uploaded photo " customer " photos see what they sent . not sure which you would get this point .. edit 07/29/2006i see now then price i paid jumps $5 $20 some strange reason .. i add it good product @ $5 but not $20	1
i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camea , its beyond description ...	1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
i love , love , love this camera . if you teens house watchout !, they'll definitely want this camera . it easy use well worth money . when my camera arrived , i amazed how small compact it . i let my son check it out first within no time we both using it . i really love movie feature . you record anywhere everywhere sound excellent . my last camera only recorded , but didn't any sound . it nothing compared this sony . 8.1 mega pixels makes pictures come out great . my sons i love it . they record all time take numerous pictures . i also like it internal memory , so if you don't memory stick yet , you still take pictures . 2.5 inch screen perfect . it makes it so easy get good shot all time . i no problems this purchase all . only thing i would recommend sony make something would protect 2.5 inch screen getting scratches , just like they optical lens . it always closed covered when its not use . but besides small detail there , sony great investment . i definitely buy sony again , especially when i decide update or if i'm looking gift give .	1
photography afficionados long two choices when it comes buying digital camera : tiny everything-automatic portable camera takes decent pictures or brick-sized everything-manual professional camera takes fantastic pictures . almost decade after introduction consumer digital camera , sony finally taken swing combining best qualities both worlds into one package , dsc-w100 solid first effort . sony tiny part down some time - dimensionally , w100 par other recent cybershot models competitor brands ' offerings , features now-common 2.5 " bright lcd display minimum buttons back . aside attractive mini-diamondplate face chrome trim , visually there little set this camera apart among others your local electronics counter . initial toying camera doesn't dispel any first impressions . all prerequisite automatic features there , buttons smartly arranged so all most common functions right hand , it obviously point-and-shoot camera . but it when you begin delve into features you realize w100 something entirely differen t.t he usual mode knob there back auto mode scenes modes , but now there program manual modes - something standard issue professional cameras but radically new point-and-shoot . this means you use any combination auto or manual settings all functions get shot . example , shooting dimly lit room , you use slow shutter flash even out lightning , or turn off flash slower shutter richer colors , or raise iso so you get steady shot higher shutter speed , or just put it auto shoot , etc . all different possibilities previously reserved just professional cameras now your disposal . camera simple or involved you want , it still fits your pocket . i've owned several other digital cameras , both portable pro , they've all somewhat manual features , but w100 takes it new level . mounting w100 tripod , i attempted get long exposure shot night sky , something all other digital cameras adequately . manually setting shutter speed , camera displayed overall exposure value i adjusted - camera telling me before even touching shutter button if resulting picture would dark , bright , or even . i set shutter slow it could go using two-second timer , fired away . picture amazing ; though only few stars visible eye , w100 caught light well over hundred . i noticed bit radial blur stars around border image , only realize later camera pointed north - shutter speed so slow i actually * capturing rotation earth * . now that manual . also special note w100 digital " smart zoom " . general rule digital cameras , you should disable digital zoom feature , zooming beyond optical range produces cropped therefore lower-quality image . but here again sony trick up it sleeve , cropping 8.1 megapixel capture regardless where you image size set . if you shoot 5 megapixel-size picture utilizes digital zoom , image actually captured full 8.1 mps then your 5mp picture cropped . result optically-zoomed clear picture . this also means lowest image size , you get full 15x zoom ( equivalent 500+ mm telephoto - pocket camera ! ) . it absolutely brilliant technique you'll probably see all future digital cameras . sony still bit more work pocket slr idea . included your purchase accessories catalog featuring array lenses filters , none which compatible w100 . it typical sony bizarre distribution features any given product lineup , but it would seem obvious most slr-like camera should slr-like accessories . w100 owners should disable auto focus illumination light when shooting people ; blazing red light great focusing inanimate subjects , but could probably used tactical light blind assailants pinch . overall , w100 remarkable newcomer truly raises bar what you expect point shoot pocket camera . novices accommodated full automation , learn gradually trying out individual manual functions while other settings remain automatic . experienced photogs right home manual mode wide range settings . five stars what hopefully sony work progress	1
bought one these year ago . works same canon battery i got camera . i alternate canon lenmar batteries haven't noticed any difference	1
silver , light , sturdy .. carries camera securely neck or belt	1
battery pack arrived quite quickly , we delighted paying far less it than manufacturer charging product works just fine	1
i received short amount time just what i needed . this way i am able my camera turned almost full day using this backup nothing worse than needing little more time able get enire family reunion unable add last family into scrapbook but this cured it all	1
np-bg1 type lith pack good picture life , but i'd carry spare if your going use your cameras movie feature	1
this bag year now love it . this what i carry main compartment : nikon d50 18-200mm lens attached . wide angle 10-20mm lensdepending where i'm going - either d50 charger , speedlight other little accessories or my canon sd550 elph its charger . top compartment holds extra batteries , cleaning supplies filters . small zipper compartment flap little bit tight anything other than cleaning cloth , extra memory , id's/credit cards . cons : woman ... strap isnt all flattering going diagonally across front , but i usually carry it sort " 1/2 slung " position or fully around front anyway ( unless i'm hiking ) . it could little snug inside if you trying carry alot accessory items . would liked see padded portion main strap little longer so padding still shoulder when bag front slung position ( since i carry it way alot ) . pros : compact yet perfect fit my camera body , 2 lens , accessories . very snug secure back - easily hike , ride bike or even horse without fear . no trouble getting used " slinging " it around front . actually use bag kind shelf stabilizing elbows while composing shot . superior lowepro design - great quality , sturdy zippers , love rain cover . note : i try slingshot 200 version 1st found it just too big my needs so exchanged it this smaller version - no regrets , cant imagine i'll ever need bag .	1
this my first review amazon because i've bought products never really felt like they deserved review . i would say i thorough search bag would fit me . i nikon d50 18-55mm lens 70-300mm zoom lens . i originally large nikon bag pain carry around . it inconvenient carry access my camera . so when searching bag i wanted something compact , easy carry , could hold my gear neatly securely , my camera easily accessible those moments when you want take quick shot put it right back . i went camera stores tried bags , looked all over internet reviews finally came across lowepro slingshot 100aw . it everything i looking plus more . besides able hold my camera gear , it able hold my battery charger , cleaning supplies , extra batteries , filters , built all weather cover . even all packed i still space my wallet , cellphone keys , thus freeing up my pants pockets . great thing bag it able give me extra stability when taking photos when bag slung around front me . bag so well designed there no worry bag opening up all your expense gear fall out . opening where you remove camera straps prevent it opening all way accident . all all i am very satisfied bag . i would recommend it anyone but if you more than couple lenses your photography arsenal i would upgrade slingshot 200aw .	1
no need run guess whether self-timer already fired when i want picture together my girlfriend . extremely useful when taking shots low light conditions long exposure , too . works perfectly my d50	1
i use it my nikon d50 it works promised . i took some long exposure shots it last night they came out crisp . i am also parent i find using remote much easier than setting timer rangling toddler place within limited window time . i recommend this device anyone i find it quite affordable . like most reviewers , i think it would great if it included accessory	1
i am fisheye lens addict . i this lens few months now , i use it almost everything . lens worth every bit i payed it . sigma customer service so fast easy . lens takes clear sharp pictures everytime . this lens takes best skateboarding band pictures ! if you considering this lens , i would definately reccomend it . i love how pictures either circular or full frame . its great investment ......	1
2 toddlers , i'm type person who likes camera me capture those unexpected moments film . elph cameras ideal this because they're small lightweight . i used 3.2 mp canon elph before this one , i thought 3.2 good until i started using this new one . clarity stability control sd700 great ! downloading photos my computer takes only seconds . i highly recommend this camera	1
worth money every way . sturdy , compact , great pictures , easy use , easy upload images	1
polarizing filters used eliminate glare non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they also used increase contrast color saturation your image . i use my polarizer not only eliminate glare , but also make skies nice shade blue or get some " pop " out clouds . there so many options consider when purchasing polarizing filter your needs . instance , linear vs . circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs . price . if you making use ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers designed work those features . linear polarizers their uses , but they manufactured differently may not work . unless you certain , just get circular polarizing filter . there some digital circular polarizers market . i am not sure what makes cir-pl lens better digital opposed film . i use canon 20d digital slr see no problems caused using supposed non-digital filter digital camera . most time , when it comes filters ; you get what you pay . mean you need expensive polarizer ? course not , just sure get right filter your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it color neutral prevent unwanted tinting . spending more color balanced filter save time post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money using step down rings . currently i use hoya pro1 filters , canon polarizing filters i previously owned without question bulkier heavier . weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items backpack all extra bits weight add up quickly . i spend good amount time my equipment my back so this big concern me . when it came down images , times i would see browning tint my photos . tint easy clean up photoshop cs2 , but i don't see problem hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it canon , it must quality . " since then i replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes cost disadvantages other similarly priced filters . pros : used film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections ghosting cons : bulky heavy not neutral color balance	-1
i recently test drove d200 impressed useabiity camera . it almost perfect . when buying i opted d80 because it very similar feature-set less cash . which meant additional money lenses . ok , it doesn't shoot 5fps or alloy body weather seals , but it sensor useability . it light , quick joy use . changing settings such iso , wb flash almost easy d200 . this fine camera . it uses sd cards - much more preferable than cf my opinion . worth every penny	1
this camera called " pro-sumer " model you should really take title seriously . quality pictures it takes just good professional digital camera same resolution . trade off it really not happy thrown bag ( or big pocket , if it fits ) . why ? because canon given it really annoying power-on switch guaranteed turn camera 90% time when you're moving it or bag . compound this problem , lens extends ( your bag ) , pushing off lens cap leaving it open possible damage . so , if you think this professional camera , kept real camera-case , you'll probably okay . if you're somebody , like me , who likes throw his camera bag or pocket , you're going annoyed power switch . said , i love quality pictures all control camera gives you over every aspect taking them . cons : stupid power-on switch always catches turns camera ; lens cap kind loose falls off easily ; widest angle maybe little too telephoto still ( around 35mm ? )pros : awesome pictures ; tons controls all over outside camera allowing you control lot without resort menus ; professional features including flash hot-shoe replaceable lens ; great battery life ; awesome picture	1
camera more advanced photographer very detailed instruction booklet . takes excellent photos auto mode . memory chip included not near big enough	1
this outstanding value . kit includes three often needed filters well excellent filter wallet . wallet itself , included tiffen booklet added extra value . i found it great value money . you get all three less than price one filter filter wallet added bonus .	1
this camera case exactly what i looking . it fits my canon sd600 perfectly . it fits like glove- not too big , not too snug , it not scratch lcd screen . it really cute nice punch color contrast basic black every other camera case out there . i've gotten lot compliments how cute it . i definitely recommend this product !	1
i love this product ! case slim enough carry around purse without taking up all room . red color fun , too !	1
need clean your digital slr sensor ? this besy way it -- conjunction wtih sensor swabs -- canned compressed air add " junk " which make your sensor worse	1
i camera w/ 12x optical tons features but i wanted something compact ready take quick snaps . this fits bill . my recent vacation i impressed how quickly it booted up focused get those unplanned shots . x-large screen makes it really easy see if you got good one image stabilisation seems work better than my previous camera ( canon a80 ) ... either or my hand steadier . last but not least - battery life impeccable . i took nearly 200 photos , plus spent lot time reviewing showing off pics friends no need recharge . battery ' custom ' one which concerned me but charger very compact travels well . it integrated prongs fold flat when not use - no cables :)	1
i wanted buy compact slim d-camera . those larger zoom quite bulky , you can't carry around all time . i think slim camera better choice . i slip into my pocket while wondering around come across something nice take picture it . you can't it huge camera . after i made up mind slim camera , my choices either casio exilim or sony dscw series . casio exilims very sexy . they lot mode scenes . they also function voice recorder . you take pictures book pages etc . they anti-shake capability which said reduce blurred images . i almost buying casio exilim . diligent person i wanted search more more . i found out so-called anti-shake feature bogus . many people found it useless . good reason choose casio . then i found picture quality exilim not really good . i found some pictures taken exilim . they soft , not crisp colors . search web reviews made photo professionals . casio exilim rated significantly less than sony picture quality . iso 200 noise still detectable most reviews . those same reviewers however found sony dscw doing better job . there no noise iso 400 which means even lower light condition sony better job ( less granularity pictures low light ) . big difference !. one feature sony made it very attractive its strong macro . it 0.74 inch which means you bring your camera 0.74 inch ( 2 mm ) close object ( say bug ) still take brilliant picture it . now comparison exilim sony summarize : casio exilimanti-shake ( it bogus)slim lower macro ( 2.5 inches)lower picture quality ( detectable noise iso 200)a lot scene modesquick shuttersony dscw seriesslim ( fact it slimmer)higher macro ( 0.74 inches)higher picture quality ( no noise iso 400)not lot scene modesquick shutterso ..... i purchased sony dscw 7 mp . i took lots pictures . they all brilliant , detailed crisp , true colors . i tried macro took pictures bugs . you see hairs legs bugs . absolutely no noise whatsoever , no blurry . it marvel technology . i took pictures fireworks july 4th using high iso setting . they came out brialliantly like professional pictures . it also uses different kind battery you can't buy your grocery which leave you vulnerable . so you may wanna buy spare one ( 40 bucks ) . but you always recharge it . it lasts much much longer than aaa or nimh batteries . it perfect choice . i highly recommend it .	1
we really like this camera ! it whole lot better than our previous one , which ran off 4 aa batteries , ran through so many aa batteries so quickly we can't even guess how many $$ wasted . this optio camera uses very nice rechargable batteries cost $5 each through ebay ( don't buy them here amazon ... ouch ! ) we've got 3 batteries getting two more so we never even worry power while long trip . ( really handy travel charger also awesome ... get it ebay just few bucks . ) startup time shutter speed very fast , so catching quick pictures finally possible us . ( my wife no longer threatens go back film after using this camera ! ) our last camera would take so long focus we never got candid shots we wanted . one only thing that even slight problem this camera power button next shutter button . ( what clueless engineer thought would good ?? ) however , now we've used it lot , we never hit button accident . all other features camera great . 1 gb memory card , we've never ever run out memory space , even taking lots short videos many many pictures medium quality . great camera , worth every cent . buy accessories ebay you'll find getting everything you need not very expensive all . ( actually , we bought camera ebay too , but these reviews great here amazon . thanks , amazon !	1
i this camera year now am very impressed . i used nikon 35mm slr all my life so i little hesitant going into digital . lugging around equipment became too much issue so i started looking . picture quality great even full optical zoom . i very rarely use digital zoom . most impressive ... camera taken 2 direct hits concrete ( 8 months ago ) still works perfectly !	1
i've this camera since just before christmas 04 . i purchased www.bhphotovideo.com $350 . i should waited until after holidays , because price come down . it great finally small camera . i often forget i even it me ( which i guess bad ! ) . over all pictures good . focus sometimes soft . it doesn't take good night photos , but takes great daytime pics	1
emphasis portability , canon digital rebel xti designed firs t-t ime dslr photographers travel enthusiasts . measuring 5.0 " 3.7 " 2.6 " weighing 1.1 lbs ., it large largest point shoot cameras one smallest dslr camera bodies market . its size source both popularity criticisms . if you large hands or heavier lens , it may feel too small . optional battery grip help , but some want something more substantial . visit store nearby find out yourself . package includes camera body lens cap , battery , charger , manual , catalogs , neck strap , usb composite video cables , cd-roms . you need lens compactflash memory card . there may some static energy packaging , so remove lens cap dust-free environment such bathroom prevent dust entering sensor . much promoted sensor cleaning system helps , but it best not get any first place . canon sells 4 versions xti : black or silver finish or without ef-s 18-55mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 lens . black or silver largely personal preference , but most lenses , most accessories , all but low-end dslr camera bodies black . kit lens , it affordable introduction dslr capable if used exclusively f/8 or f/11 apertures ( soft other apertures ) . other words , lens not ideal shooting under low light . if you don't get zoom lens now , start canon ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii . it famous top-notch performance very low price . due xti aps-c image sensor ( compositions multiplied 1.6 ) , this lens becomes 35mm-equivalent 80mm . if you budget good zoom lens , over 100 lenses , canon you covered . some canon popular zoom lenses include ef 28-135mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 usm , ef 17-40mm f/4l usm , ef-s 17-55mm f/ 2.8 usm , ef 24-105mm f/4l usm . if these too pricey , third party vendors such sigma tamron make canon-compatible lenses less . their focus not nice canon usm but they generally outperform canon lower-end lenses . tamron sp af 17-50mm f/ 2.8 di ii ld aspherical ( if ) sigma 18-50mm f/ 2.8 ex dc af 17-70mm f/ 2.8 - 4.5 dc macro popular among budget-minded photographers . 10.1 megapixels image sensor , xti benefit sharper lenses . although increasing resolution over same image sensor area increase noise , canon improved sensor technology maintain low noise floor high dynamic range . performance wise , there very little criticize . great example canon trademark smooth , high contrast , saturated , low noise . noise remains low even iso 800 . it said shooting raw equivalent getting extra exposure ( 1.0 ev ) it help you maintain usable details acceptable noise iso 1600 . low noise gives xti bit excuse missing in-body image stabilizer . according canon , lens more effective location image stabilizer , especially telephoto . that true but i think feature would've nice . consolation , xti mirror lockup reduces vibration caused mirror movement . my sole performance criticism metering mode . it includes only partial not spot metering mode ( very useful when shooting high contrast scenes such candlelit birthday cake ) . perhaps more problematic evaluative metering mode , which occasionally underexposes images 2/3 ev or so . some criticized xti " plasticky " build . except metal lens mount , exterior largely made high quality engineering plastic rubbery paint . if you drop it , it probably crack or break , but it sturdy well made . flipping power lever , it starts up almost immediately ready use . much promoted auto sensor cleaning kicks when powering up down . most dslrs , there virtually no shutter lag it focuses split second ( especially when using usm lens ) . continuous shooting mode fast memory card , it take 10 raws or 27 jpegs 3 frames per second . raw images 10 mb each , so get speed 2 gb or larger memory card , such sandisk ultra ii series . replacing both 1.8 " lcd info display 2.5 " high resolution lcd led backlighting . it displays current camera settings , photos memory , menu . thanks greater real estate more refined user interface , xti very intuitive pleasure use . minus 10% lower battery life , which merely adequate begin . xti 95% crop 0.8 optical viewfinder displays 9 auto focus points , shutter speed , aperture , more , but misses iso speed , white balance , metering mode . overall , xti viewfinder more than adequate but pales nikon d80 larger more comprehensive one . highlights software package imagebrowser ( mac os universal binary ) , zoombrowser ( windows ) , digital photo professional ( mac os universal binary windows ) . imagebrowser zoombrowser easy-to-weight lightweight applications managing jpeg raw . digital photo professional considerably more powerful lets you use xti dust delete data feature removing dust its sensor cleaning hardware couldn't remove	1
first all i must say this camera take some wonderful , even incredible looking pictures . but since everyone else proclaiming its virtues , i write mainly its negatives . there aren't too many , but it few drawbacks ; couple which i just don't understand . this camera now fourth digital camera i bought . first nikon coolpix 995 my wife . second sony f707 me . third canon sd400 my wife . lastly xti me . so i little experience cameras or near " prosumer " level . this why i find it hard believe how xti get some these things wrong . first all white balance . my 4 cameras , this camera , far , worst indoors auto white balance . i am using compact fluorescent light bulbs daylight lights house xti makes everything look yellow . none other white balance options close either . one saving grace custom white balance option . you perform this custom white balance taking picture something gray ( preferably large gray piece paper or card made just this , it centered picture ) then selecting this picture custom white balance reference . after doing this white balance nothing short superb . i even it work just zooming something white then selecting it reference picture . ( i guess white works just well gray . ) but my disappointment , " why this all ? " all three other cameras mine handle this lighting much better than xti . but what really saddest canon elph handles it better than xti . it nice , after some hassle , it good white balance . but i shouldn't carry around gray card everywhere i go or touch up every photo i take get right white balance . especially when 1 � year old canon it better , half price . my next gripe lack spot metering . it wouldn't bother me so much if : 1 ) other metering options more consistent . 2 ) every other camera i own didn't it . 3 ) canon tech support hadn't told me they reserve spot metering their higher end cameras ..... especially when their own [ ... ] it !! how $500 camera higher end than xti ? usually i select partial metering then turn up exposure 1/3 2/3 stop get decent exposure . but it would much more consistent just spot metering option ; especially backlit subjects , or lot harsh , low sun shade picture . my last gripe included software , especially raw pictures . don't even try loading this software anything but dual-core or 4 ghz pc . software ssslllooowww !!! one thing , both zoombrowser ex digital photo professional start scanning hard drive pictures soon software loads , there doesn't seem any way stop it . if you lot pictures your computer , it take long , long time before software lets you anything . make sure you coffee ready ! other thing software just memory hog runs excruciatingly slow ; especially when trying edit raw or . cr2 files . speaking which , why canon use such non-standard file ? i would glad use some other software editing my raw , but canon proprietary files can't opened other " normal " programs . so now i'll just stick . jpg . then there other complaints , which true . kit lens isn't very good . form-factor could use work . ( i am constantly hitting fel button accident ) view finder kind smallish ; among others . overall i am pleased camera . i some wonderful pictures already wall . but i've also few real stinkers due lack spot metering occasional terrible white balance . if it weren't these two ( rather huge me ) issues , than i would give xti 5 stars . but until canon fixes these glaring issues it won't given my highest rating . it also won't recommended me anyone who serious into photography .	1
i bought this lens replace kit lens rebel xt . i find this lens very good value , very good value . i also canon 28-135 3.5 ... find 28-105 lens very stong lens price . it might even just notch clearer then 28-135 but half price . it size nice light weight fits nice rebel since it smaller dslr . all all , great lens budet price but it dosn't act like it . fast focus , fair range , nice size , easy lug around . i would sugest this lens any one first my list someone who not wanting go crazy lenses extras their camera , just want simply get some nice pics without spending all their lunch money . also lens takes same size filters kit lens , so if you spent few dollers few filters kit lens your luck . i know i happy still use 3 filters i've already got .	1

it works great - no touching sensor brush . great produc	1
i bought this gizmo clear cmos detector my digital slr camera . it seemed like good alternative using specialized , expensive sensor wipes , it would not invalidate camera warranty . results my camera good but not perfect . many large particles dust blown off detector . however , some medium-sized particles merely pushed edges . nonetheless , i really like air blaster just my camera . aside my camera , i used this number other devices around my home office . it works particularly well clearing dust out vents my laptop underneath keys my laptop keyboard . however , it works poorly clearing out dust grime my desktop keyboard . summary , i would say this good device owners digital slr cameras , although it not perfect substitute sensor wipes . owners electronic equipment general , this clever device works reasonably well cleaning dust out some places	1
i am very happy gotten this flash .. it works pretty well , i like its performance	1
this camera first digital me , only camera i ever enjoyed . macro setting gives amazing closeups bugs , flowers , etc . purchase charger some batteries , i've kept it going almost nothing . better get big memory card , too . silly settings like " color swap " " fireworks " fun play . my only complaint it slow recover shots , so you miss some action kids , etc . price , it can't beat . gramma	1
very quick delivery . product exactly advertised . very happy whole process product	1
please aware this camera shock sensitivityi pretty happy this all-in-one compact camera until it repaired second time . it sensitivity vibration or slight bump while lens out way too sensitive real world . result it loses it ability focus zoom . it didn't help it commonly powered while pocket , lens protruding , thereby causing unintentional harm lens assembly . first time it happened casio repaired it under warranty . second time it outside warranty repair center wanted $137 repair it - that more than 1/3 original purchase price . i won't reinvest weak product . i'd rather put money into new camera altogether	-1
i spent weekend researching digital cameras , exhausting confusing , so many choose , when i store looking various cameras , customer just started telling me how much he loved this camera he just bought , which this one ; i assumed it ' sign ' . it . small size fantastic , put your shirt pocket or purse , almost weightless . quick shutter takes best pictures new baby grandchild any camera anyone family used . ( others sony canon digital cameras ) movies excellent . quality color images perfect , not too over-digitized some said . everyone family thinks i'm wonderful photographer , but it not me , it this camera . battery life really long , it take good pictures multiple types poor visibility situations . first month , i dropped it few times , once sidewalk it survived which impressive . viewfinder big advantage bright sunlight . after using loving it 9 months , telephoto froze . i sent it back casio , they fixed it ; it took 3-4 weeks , which little long , but not charge me repair . baby pictures fantastic , especially because it takes picture so fast , scenery pics all look like national geographic .	1
this lens top notch . quality photographs best i ever experienced camera .	1
i only wish i bought this lens earlier so i could using it longer . i am especially pleased short minimum focus distance - 3 inches . this allows you get very close small subject still fill frame subject . i no problems this lens i love it	1
love this battery . long lasting just good name brand	1
i canon sd-550 . this battery works perfect it . i've noticed no difference charge time usage when compare original manufacterer one . except price lot lower	1
this replacement battery half cost canon yet offers longer life . i bought it when i first got my sd10 . when one battery runs out , spare goes . lenmar still works great while canon near end life ! i am buying two more since they so cheap ! not buy no name batteries ebay . they not last worth darn basically waste money ! don't it ..	1
i olympus 5mp point-n-shoot camedia camera i pretty happy portraits . i annoyed w/ fixed lens prevented me taking good photos wildlife . i hummingbird feeders my backyard unless you've opportunity work hummingbird families years , sweet , tiny animals skittish don't often pose you when you get too close . when my point-n-shoot stopped focusing , i took advantage this situation rationalizing this bigger purchase . what joy it use this camera . 6.3 mp significant improvement over 5 ability take photos manual mode cannot understated . fixed point-n-shoot , camera refused shoot if it didn't " feel " it focus ... so it impossible shoot sunsets , lightning or other natural beauties " infinity " range focal length . rebel makes use compact flash - oldest , yet still best technology taking fast , high-quality photos digital cameras . my less than perfect rating due small memory buffer . you take up 3fps very easily , but if you click-click-click shutter , it doesn't matter if bigfoot , loch ness monster elvis start doing little soft-shoe right front you , time rebel finishes writing recent 3 quick shots cf card , shot century already slithered back into swamp time camera ready used again . if you're taking portraits , not problem . click here there you'll never notice lack memory buffer ... but if you're shooting ball game or other quick moving objects , you're going get frustrated very quickly . flash decent , but you really need good flash like 580 hot-shoe if you want better even spread avoidance red-eye . lot folks shrug red-eye since most affordable or free programs like iphoto or photoshop elements built-in correction red-eye - but red-eye correction one click only available humans . if you're shooting wildlife , forget any software one-click ( or million clicks ! ) solution blue-eye dogs , yellow-eye cats , flaming-demon eye bunnies or variety odd reflections you get bouncing off retinas various species . best way circumvent this problem avoid bouncing flash directly into retinas your subjects get-go . no more glare or odd reflections when you use better flash . ability upgrade better lenses crux slr ownership . sky limit . get good wide-angle good , fast telephoto you've got yourself set some great shots . this camera isn't going take advantage cf cards faster than 40x , so you save money buying slightly slower cf cards , but i invested 80x cards so i use them when i upgrade cameras . this rebel gotten me back into photography after decade-long hiatus . camera automatically detects vertical shots turns them 90 degrees you lcd window . it quick easy adjust iso " push " film ( so speak ) take advantage low-light situations , but you get same grainy effects you when you push real film . iso 100 using 512mb cf card , you 157 photos your disposal - if you push it all way 1600 , 104 shots same card . 400 , your shots already compromized regarding print quality ... but if sasquatch comes-a-knockin ' wee hours , you'll still get decent proof if you shoot 1600 . background film photography spanning 2 decades , i didn't even consult manual this camera use it fresh out box . it handles many ways like professional film slr , unlike point-n-shoots , there aren't cryptic settings no film parallel . sunny days outdoor shots , this camera sheer joy use	1
i purchased d-30 amazon last year i previously using digital nikon . improvement monumental all aspects . i subsequently drowned my camera , i am getting ready repurchase d30 . they not ready water yet ? i taken approximately 5000 pictures saved them all most usable format i continue same . photoshop software comes camera very user friendly , i am sure there many features yet learn , but i extremely happy what i already used . i hesitate say mastered	1
this camera great photographing artwork . it only camera i could find doesn't bow edges paintings or watercolors ( i think lot cameras lens distors things , but you can't tell until you photograph something supposed rectangular ) . color reproduction also good . if you want camera takes good pictures distant objects , or one higher than 2mp resolution , look camera .	1
this very nice starter camera easy use . batteries run out kind fast , but once i bought rechargeable batteries it solved problem ! surprising good quality small amount money i paid it	1
this my second canon . there lot whistles bells this camera take time novice figure out . my biggest complaint trying remember take off lense cap before turning it . my other cameras not cap . all all it takes excellent quality photos , so you not disappointed	1
i bought one when it first came market back may . half year 5,000 pictures later , here some my comments : - it great digital camera its own class . " class " i mean one should not compare it dslr because s3 not one . so not expect it overcome " shutter lag " easily , although among other dc ( digital camera ) i used , shutter lag s3 greatly improved -- degree i feel comfortable taking photos very fast pace , e.g. , catching flying birds . ( however , only good dslr completely eliminate shutter lag s3 not dslr . ) one also should not compare s3 " small " point-'n-shoot dcs . s3 not small those -- it won't easily slide into your pocket , unless your pocket relatively big loose ( like mine ) . but slightly larger body brings great features none small dc offer . - big optical zoom ( 12x ) . 12x great combined canon imagine stabilization , s3 turns into powerful large zoom camera superb imagine quality . my recent trips included shooting ( cameras case you wonder ) wild wolf yellowstone national park . this little s3 came out only one capture animals great distance , other " big guns " professionals carry . feature eliminates hand shake great effect i could shoot 12x low light still get quality photos . i also highly recommend " tc-dc58b tele converter lens " s3 ( or s2 ) which gives you 1.5 zoom effectively make s3 18x zoom ( equivalent 600mm lens ) . check how much those big telephoto lens cost ( close 10k ) ... - excellent video shooting . again feaure one almost never finds any other dc or dslr . s3 takes dvd quality video stereo sound , not just video clips most dc . this little ( almost ) pocket-size camera now forces our digital videocam into early retirement . - many other great features . however those more or less standard one always try argue some other dc may similar or better features . i won't comment those . summary , s3 great small-size dc . its superb lens offers big 12x zoom , two technology canon pride . it also offers dvd video shoot stereo sound -- this feature alone save you digital vidoecam . one suggestion -- get big sd card if you want shoot video too . i 4g sd card i think 2g must . also battery life excellent . it uses 4 aa-battery , which seems lot odd beginning . but it comes handy because long you get aa battery you never worry power . typical dslr , if battery out you day unless you find power outlet recharge ( your charger you ) . i one small complain . menu button back camera location where my palm presses body . sometimes i raise s3 i see menu viewfinder because my palm pressed it strong enough trigger it . press needed i lost several shots because this . i other dslr quality lens . but i always take s3 me any trip	1
i purchased filter kit my sony camera . price considerably cheaper than sony quality great ! i'm looking into other items offered good price opteka	1
when i first got camera i nervous whether or not i'd able use understand it well since i usually buy point shoot type camera . i pleasantly surprised how easy it use all functions it really . pictures really high quality video crystal clear . camera lightweight perfect grab go or capture any occasion . i like design it i love fact i get professional looking pictures time time again ...	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
i concerned when i ordered this filter previous problems reported here . but , i hurry needed two these vacation . there absolutely no problem product . both filters sealed perfect condition . could packed little better shipping box , but arrived good condition . no problems photos taken this product	1
this lens superb . it feels like high quality pro lens ( not surprisingly ) . shots just stunning ; fantastic color , razor sharp , beautiful bokeh etc etc . i initially considered 18-200(vr ) until i saw comments this lens . look into it , what i tell there very little ( real ) comparison two . i believe you forget how much you paid soon you see results . i mention this lens superb ....?	1
i love this lens . this excellent complement my nikon 28-70 2.8 . it well balanced d200 f100 ( mb grip ) . just last weekend used family wedding . it really not lens casual photography . if you not willing tolerate heavy equipment , sincerely , you take much better pictures ps digital cameras , i sometimes . after all taking pictures capturing moments if this lens get into your way , it no use . i personally only prefer fixed 2.8 apertures across zoom range . this very important me since i like use mostly aperture priority especially taking people pictures . why i love this lens . this very expensive lens . if vr not important you , go more reasonably priced almost identical optical qualities nikon 80-200 2.8 . me vr very important since i cannot afford use tripods when i am moving around taking pictures my kids or friends . if you could afford it , it great lens you never regret . if you cannot afford it just you thinking purchasin expensive camera body , don't waste your time camera specs , d70 vs d200 vs d2xs etc . buy cheaper camera , but still buy this lens long you willing carry heavy equipment around comitted take pictures such heavy equipment . bokeh amazing , rich contrast , creamy blurring behind subject 2.8 simply delicate delicious	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens .	1
it better save camera real lens which replaced this filter broken than expensive lens behind it . this real " lens saver "	1
i am only giving 4 stars , because i just receive it through mail couple days ago . so i still haven't get chance fully try out everything . but i tell you this camera very handy , it very small i throw it my small purse ( my purse usually don't much room , b/c i would already so much stuff it , like my pda , i-pod , cell phone , wallet , keys , pack tissue et . ) take it me anywhere . i love design this camera , it very cool . pictures pretty clear , even one taking during nights . thing i love this camera it not noisy , it very quick ( i no patience , so it good me i snap pictures crazy quickly ) . overall , i find this camera pretty good .	1
this camera fits easily my pocket takes fantastic pictures ultra compact . it easy use i no problems it	1
i've upgraded older canon series this sd600 . price i payed just under $250 . purchase spare battery - they small worth small investment carry extra , get bigger memory card , 6 mp take up more room so you need more space . 2.5 " screen takes great size good clarity . except extreme brightness ( outside direct sun ) no problem reviewing my pictures . like previous canon this camera user friendly easy use . automatic settings adjust light settings take best picture it cuts out guess work doing it manual . downloading snap . computer interface easy navigate pretty self-explanitory . 6 mp all i need . i take lot pictures work , often zoom picture see details - this resolution just perfect . good balanace picture quality jpg size . any bigger , files become pain email ( especially size limits ) deal . look snazzy red case this camera - this fit snug case rigid so it gives camera screen extra protection without lot extra room . i just slip it into my purse or pocket - it really small without sacrificing functionality ease use .	1
i received this tripod christmas i am totally delighted it ! it comes case small light enough me carry . just few days use , it made difference my low light level non-flash photos	1

only problem i live holland things sent my daughter us then forwarded since you don't ship overseas . any hope may change future	1
this my first digital camera i ever bought , i am completely satisfied it . talk abt resolution or camera feature . all it packed into one small sleek camera . i recommend this digital camera everybody . i would say if i would decided later future get one . i would alwayz go canon . they best making digital cameras	1
this pouch godsend so i bought 2 . i use them my efs 60-mm efs 85-mm lenses . base feels firm so lens sitting inside protected won't go anywhere made out strong naugahide . pouch itself thick felt rope pulls made heavy nylon twine feels silky your hand . whole pouch well built protect but handled roughly still protect contents , your precious lenses	1
i love this flash . i just recently purchased it used it 2 big events it worked perfectly . i still don't know everything it capable doing but am still able work it just fine without even reading manual . i would definitely recommend this flash .	1
finally able put some money aside get new flash my d50 . i looked less expensive sigma flashes , but end i decided go nikon . i figured i spend money camera , i'm going get better flash . used it other day took some great portraits my daughter . flash worked like charm . it better than camera pop-up flash . pop-up flash comes handy if you can't or forget bring main flash , but it really nice extra power sb-600 . if you think your going lot indoor photography ( birthdays , holidays , etc .. ) this great flash . if you children , best bet portrait photos ,,, nikon d50 , nikkor 50mm 1.8 sb-600 flash . great combination very good price . we haven't take kids their pictures taken studio . this set-up , you take great portraits your kids their own environment more convenient time you kids decide . no traveling nice cloths worry	1
canon 1d mk iin bomb . i opted this camera over cheaper higher megapixel camera , 5d . it rare you need more than 8m pixels sharpness speed this camera nothing short amazing especially when comparing my other digital slr , canon 20d . this camera i enjoy many year	1
cover over lense broke/small lcd screen/ pictures pritty good/battery life pritty good/some images come out bit blurry if theres no flash your hands arnt steady/takes nice portaits/ easy use/ veiw-finder	1
eyeglass wearer , i suffered needlessly years	1
d70s minor update original d70 introduced 2004 , few new features slightly larger lcd . it still great camera , but expect it replaced new d80 , which 40 percent more pixels , 2.5 -inch lcd , additional useful features old price d70s . so , you probably save little money still purchase sophisticated digital slr if you wait until prices d70s stabilize new , lower level . , say , $600 , this camera would incredible bargain . d70s shined one best cameras its class since its introduction . example , it 1/500th second flash synch speed ( found no other camera but d50 ) so you keep ambient light under control avoid ghost images . its autofocus fast accurate , features both single-autofocus , continuous-autofocus ( tracking action ) , novel " automatic " autofocus mode switches af-s af-c required . if you no nikon lenses , get this camera 18-70mm kit lens , which very sharp versatile , rather than more limited 18-55 lens . you won't regret it	1
it learning curve , that sure , but wow ! this camera worht every penny , far more stable then comparable canon rebel , product comes better lenses . quality glass matter	1
i got this lens go wider 20d . i wanted go wider so i got 5d . started shooting events this lens i learned 580ex couldn't give me enough light dark . used lens during day . terrible problems lensflare . hood showed up edges pictures ( wide ) . went back 24-70l my primary lens . when this lens works circumstances right , results stunning . i'm trying use two flashes get power use it night , again terrible flare problems . whenever it matters i go back 24-70l . i just don't all these problems i t.t he problems 16-35 lens appear wide end . 35 lens operates well but that not what i bought lens . i love lens but it lens gives me most frustration worry . wish it cost less but what you	1
received some christmas cash , i put it good use purchase this lens . it works great my digital rebel certainly fine choice any eos canons . sure , it pricey little heavy , but if you want fast , wide-angle zoom lens , there little else equivalent . zoom range takes you wide scenics excellent indoor flash shots 35mm ( canon speedlite ex accessory ) . usm focusing motor quiet very quick . comes canon lens hood . don't forget add 77mm uv filter protect optics full time !	1
excellent product . easy get it started . great features , clear pictures . everyone sees it wants it	1
picture quality better than i expected . you still can't see picture sides , but straight it good . interface load my pictures very simple . i would like few more options available , but simplicity purposes , it works great	1
this camera excellent one !! really when you compare its price its results level quality you get you know why this best its category , i'm getting very professional results using it lot styles .. highly recommended	1
i'm really impressed , i bought sd-110 year ago quick small digital trips . i never planning take it diving . housing really impressive , i've 4 dives month i waterproof case ( wp-dc10 ) it works great . i so excited try it out i went water full memory card . i got down 35ft took my first picture " memory card full " . it easy navigate all buttons i able delete while following my buddy . taking pictures fast moving fish doesn't work out range flash 1-3ft . my deepest dive so far 109ft off monterey coast , i worked if it 10ft water	1
recently picked up hobby digital photography i not aware nuances importance some accessories . back " day " when shooting 35mm film i could barely afford cost processing - let alone what i thought fancy accessories . well - some reading trip alaska my canon digital rebel xt - i learned , appreciate , importance lens hood . i bought rubber lens hood ( not lens specific ) local camera store totally unacceptable - then bought lens hood my canon lens amazon . it works great - no flare - no vignetting - it makes lens look pretty cool too ! i would suggest hood all your lenses never shooting without - obvious - it saves front lens bumping damage which important longer lenses or tight quarters like shooting photo excursion boat full other people all jockeying shot ! amazon service prices - usual - fantastic although i hate wait things - i am usually happy i when i order here . happy snapping !!	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
i this camera 4 yrs now - i take it all my business travels . whenever i get chance go out weekends , i take this camera my sony camcorder my backpack , roam streets new city shoot pictures . pictures i shoot this camera just awesome - no matter whatever experiment i it . most useful features : 1 . aperture control depth field preview - lets focus foreground blur background2 . shutter speed control upto infinity - lets you control amount time which shutter kept open3 . it pretty rugged , dont try dropping it :) i used it shoot pics ' maid mist ' niagara falls i almost thought i going lose it . but it worked liked charmnegatives - bulky , but you get used it , it always gets attention - cost developing film - what i these days just get photos cd , then develop only those photographs good . why this camera better than digital camera ? - if you spending $200 digital camera , i feel slr way far too ahead any digital camera price range - if you spending $1000 digital camera , digital slrs very mature today - worth buying . ideally , i would buy this slr , take this whenever i really want take good photographs , then i would also want $100 kodak digital camera casual shots . this would mean ideal combination . if you buying this slr , you also consider buying film/photo scanners ( available less than $150 now ) - which lets you scan negatives/positives without even going cheap cd print . reviews what i read amazon , these scanners must amazing	1
i am ameture photographer i love my new camera , i also enjoy my low price amazon your best ! im so happy i finally found price i afford !! thank you !	1
worked well while i took pictures fireworks over lake tahoe 4th july . only wish camera accessories canon logo weren't so expensive .	1
canon ef 85mm 1.2 lens earned ample praise photographers critics alike one finest portrait ( medium telephoto ) lenses available . it only one currently produced maxium aperture 1.2 ( decade ago carl zeiss introduced special , limited edition 85mm 1.2 planar its contax manual focus 35mm slr system ; this lens alleged optically superior canon . ) . this new improved version 85mm 1.2 autofocus 1.8 faster than its predecessor , via usm motor relatively whisper-quiet operation . fine optic working under low-light conditions , lens now better due its improved optical design faster autofocusing . without question it one finest series canon lenses available ; these new improvements only enhance its reputation . if i owned canon equipment choose canon ef 85mm 1.2 ii usm lens or its illustrious predecessor , then without question i would willing acquire this fine new lens	1
let me first start off saying - long time canon user . i own 6 or 7 lenses , including three series lenses , this far one my favorites - if not my absolute favorite . i shoot mostly glamour erotica type work 20d . so right there , this lens not true 15mm me - but 1.6 x15mm . it sharp tack . it light weight . it very short ( i call it nub lens ) . it autofocus amazing . very little barrel distortion ... highly recommended . this lens probably sharp ( if not sharper ) than my 24-70 2.8 or my 17-40 4.0 lens .	1
charger unit or batteries ( or both ) don't work right : i use batteries one time , rotation power my zen mp3 player . sometimes i put discharged batteries charger , plug it , light blinks red , then goes off . only supposed show either red ( discharged , charging ) or green ( fully charged . ) this morning 3 batteries show fully charged , i take one out , it discharged . all these problems happened first unit , i returned it monster after they took their sweet time , got replacement which works just erratically . monster stuff looks good , but it last time i am going buy their brand	-1

early adopter digital , dating 1999 agfa ephoto 1280 1680 current iteration nikon family , i attest this camera flexible any my film cameras i use studio location work . fujifilm migrated best features mecanical film camera over this model . hot shoe external mounted flash sync terminal off camera flash , cable release socket shutter button , fuji melded best analog best digital . 9 mega pixel resolution , iso 80 1600 , shutter speeds 30 seconds 1/4000 , 1.6 inch ccd sensor , fujinon 28 300 mm ( 135 equivalent ) zoom , tilting lcd monitor ( if you use those things ) , raw file format support , real time histogram display , eleven shooting modes , movie recording , af assist illuminator full manual control when needed , nikon , canon , olympus , et al lot catching up . no need change lenses means sealed camera equates sensor staying spring time fresh body . no dust getting every time lens swapped ( although , i still miss all nikon glass ) . all this less than $ 600.0	1
many options this camera mechanically body camera rather than internal menu so wanting change focusing method etc easy ! shaking no problem 10.7 optical zoom warning icons appear if it may problem . icons appear if subject isn't focused warning you change focusing method . automatic power turnoff save batteries after two or five minutes , your choice . you set camera take instant pictures ; again , your choice . this camera allows you set your options rather than camera go default after power off change it back your option . problem i my previous camera . maybe little pricey , but results great !	1
i paid $225 out door this camera it competes cameras almost twice price ! automatic setting , it takes incredible photos , but capability go manual if you so inclined . price , there nothing market comes close . macro this camera great close ups i taken even automatic setting unbelievable . if you looking something slr like , but not slr price , this comes close . course , slr take better photos if you expert , but if you amateur or intermediate photographer want something gets job , put this one your list ... taking price into consideration this thing doesnt disappoint . you glad you purchased this one !	1

i am not photographer , but pictures i take look great . it feels great know i capture memories vivid color too . ( that setting i always use . ) other hand though , there long wait time use camera again after picture taken using camera flash . i don't quite know why but it seems if you take many pictures quick succession then using cameras flash not best way go ! all all , price i paid quality quite suitable . if you don't any experience photography , buy this one	1
coolpix l4 great camara . love night modes , portrait . takes great pictures , took it our honeymoon , all pictures came out great . it also takes very good movies , i thought it wouldn't why i didn't go one speaker , but seeing cuality both pictures video , i should gone one mic , that l3	1
i'm using this hood canon ef-s 10-22mm lens 20d . it bit shocking how big this hood until you realize it really necessary very wide field view . canon 20d , lens equivalent ef 16-35mm 2.8 , only it 3.5 - 4.5 . bottom line it trick made same good quality rest canon stuff	1
amatuer photographer this gives me what i need price i afford . it many features i am still learning how use . difference pictures d50 takes dslr compared cheap digital camera like night day . i am really happy this camera lens combination i purchased . i anything macro spider zoom-in squirrel sitting tree . battery good life span i rarely change it my spare while shooting . remember puchase seperately your memory card it not part purchase . i'd recommend least 2gb card , which also purchased amazon . i able catch squirrel jumping trees because number frames you take each second . it also so easy take photos indoors without using flash obtrusive during event you photographing . i also recommend purchasing 52mm lens filters , keep your nikkor lenses free fingerprints , etc .	1
long time film person , i really wanted find digital slr could surpase feel quality film without guess . other digital cameras basically point shoot versions . two children athletics year round , d50 it all . we've shot over 3000 pictures past three months just soccer softball . nikon software makes converting storing breeze . only thing missing protector viewfinder , it standard d70 now d80 . there aftermarket available fine dept . i recommended d70 so many people nikon must put me their marketing team	1
i've my canon a510 over year i still love it . i've taken it vacation me several times , including one trip yellowstone park , where i took 1000 pictures . it great . it small light i like way it fits my hand . it fast . i never spend time waiting it . it takes great pictures ! it uses 2 batteries batteries last longer than my last camera lasted using 4 . only problem i've occassionally lens cover stick not completely open . i just barely touch it my finger it unsticks opens rest way so that not major issue	1
my existing battery aged i started look forward replacement . after i read several reviews , i preferred choose original one , because heating performance problems . therefore , i found good bundle price if i'd selected cord , battery case my sd100 camera . way , i not good case this new one . i rated 4 stars , because i preferred stay original cord	1
after researching numerous websites looking canon fitted case my new camera , i again turned amazon found just what i looking lowest price . leather case fits well isn't bulky , just protective . now i don't worry damaging camera dumping it my purse everything else so it always handy impromptu shots . neat , comfortable neck strap just added bonus	1
i ordered this camera december , it since then , it amazing camera . first time i ever professional camera , it takes time learn how use it . it not point shoot camera . if you want large pictures like crop , this may not camera you . however if you want ability take great pictures , learn how use professional camera great price this one buy . ability custom curves , which means predetermined parameters different conditions . ability chage iso random different conditions . you pay five thousand dollars its successor , dx2 , however $2000 this bargin you never find again . jim comfor	1
i bought this trip not only it fit my purpose but it makes camera look even cooler than it already looks . i several people stop me ask me what it so i got chance explain how it benefited me	1
i took plunge bought bg-e3 battery grip canon . after reading reviews off-brand model deciding i didn't want any ' button ' problems , i got canon . i'm very happy it , ( not standpoint extra battery capacity because i 2 batteries all times anyway ) but because i like ' look feel ' additional weight fit my large male hands . i felt without it , i might drop camera any time while it safely suspended my neck , i don't like feeling . i also like able spin camera portrait or landscape shots very quickly cleanly extra set buttons available change tv av settings various effects . i got some exceptionally nice photos waterfall this made it easy use . if you're thinking buying it , it worth every hard-earned penny should significantly enhance both professional amateur uses	1
i compared number pro-sumer cameras became firmly convinced this best camera money . although nikon one time considered premier camera professional , they now take second stage canon not only engineering , but quality lens , innovative user-friendly design , overall quality . i used camera approximately one month delighted . talken pictures over 35 years - including professional - always using minolta equipment all those years , i am truly enamored this canon camera	1
i my canon eos 30d week after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted photography . i bought 17-85mm canon lens it takes phenomenal pics especially using software post-processing raw . i also 70-300mm lens sports/outdoors/nature bursts 5fps beautiful sound . i bought camera through dell rebates currently this best deal out there ! strongly recommend . pay extra $$$ get this over rebel xti . you won't disappointed	1
this lens works very well two amateur photographers like my wife i . we take photos our kids their sports activities . even though lens little heavy side feels like we shaking little when we snap picture , none our shots come out blurry . i am pleasantly surprised this . we feel it well worth price we paid . ( under $100	1
i bought this lens when i purchased my nikon d70s february . i admit i not used it too much . however , when i used it , i am pleased results . mostly , i walking around town practicing taking photos , i little use 85mm , because it not good " point-and-shoot " scenes . when i taken portrait shots , however , 85mm very clear creates great depth field , which i find important . i hope this helpful	1
it very sharp lens . you wised use it extensively little children , they such clear faces . careful when you use this lens middle age women . it could show imperfecton thousand fold . again very sharp , very fast af focusing my nikon f80 . ecxelent portrature lens , but careful-women hate you unflattering portrature . my advise use black white film-you see less imperfection prints same rasor sharp focus	1
i bought this lens go my canon digital rebel xt . i absolutely love this lens . i got it try some insect other macro shots it served this purpose very well . some practice this lens produce fantastic macros some great bokeh boot . i read other reviews must say i never scared insect away noise mentioned before . i taken countless insect shots this lens . it bit louder than other lenses i but i don't see it problem . one problem i encounter when using autofocus busy closeup scene it often focus background instead say closer insect flower . when this happens i just flip it manual focus way . no big deal . overall , great lens even greater price . definitely worth it . ( i submitted photo bee i took couple days ago this lens example . )	1
canon ef 50mm 2.5 macro lens yet example canon doing fine job catching up likes nikon , zeiss leica respect optical design ; optically it may best 50mm macro lens currently available 35mm slr film photography . i am impressed lens cheap this counts least one aspheric lens element apochromatic lens design ; unfortunately it not nearly durable lens celebrated series lens line or canon ef 100mm macro lens . unless you constantly working out field taking close-up photography , then durability this lens lens mount barrel should not issue . more importantly user quality its images , read some test reports this lens , i no doubt it capable performer . those interested digital macro photography may choose look instead new 60mm macro lens , which optimized use canon digital slr cameras	1
this hood comes 100-400 , so don't buy it separately . pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
i didn't ton time research this flash . i've used it now several occasions my canon 5d couldn't happier it . it great shooting portraits . i shoot 10 shots row flash keeps up . i would definitely purchase plastic diffuser - get rid typical flash harsh light	1
i'll spare technical review 580ex flash now . i've using this new flash on-the-go shootings find it very helpful especially capabilities using multi flash units off-shoe mode . it great hard reach places where i want produce more light or fast moving subjects , i.e. wedding guests fast pets . i plan pick up least 2 more these units it compatibility most part . not only i get good light coverage subjects , but possibilities making more interesting artistic photographs defines my work . still nothing beats use higher end lighting kits like profoto acute systems . but that alot lug around .	1
i love this camera . it my second canon , 7mp , best value money i've seen . i took it france this summer loved fact i could recharge battery overnight while my friends constantly changing their batteries ( searching places buy them ! ) . my favorite option " scene " button . i don't think i'll ever try " underwater " option , but " night shot " " inside shot " work fantastically . it also seems though you take movies until card or battery fail - which huge improvement over my older canon . unlike lot newer cameras , this one viewfinder . friend mine nikon no viewfinder it extremely hard use bright sunshine . i carried my camera my purse without case few days ago new orleans without problem - it worked like charm . i would recommend this camera anyone who wants easy-to-use model produces fabulous results .	1

this hood more than adequate job controlling flare ef 100mm f/2 . additionally , hood provide protection those who 1 ) not adorne their lenses uv/sky filters , or 2 ) so adorne them ! lens already capable performer ; it moreso hood . price bit steep , but not effect its performance . thus , my rating stands	1
i bought this hood canon 85mmf 1.8 lens , one incredible lens . years ago i went lecture ernst wilde , mr . hasseblad himself , where he showed difference lens hood would make hasseblad lens . since then i always used them faithfully every lens i own . longer lens , more efective lens hood if it specifically designed lens . this hood canon their medium telephoto lenses , 85f 1.8 , 100usm macro , 135mmf 2.8 lenses . hood protect your lens dust , scratches , damage , while same time preserving maximum contrast your lens deliver . this differs filter , take away inherit lens sharpness contrast . analogy wearing baseball cap which improve your vision protect your eyes cataracts , while not distorting your vision like sunglasses	1
just received canon ef 2x ii adorama . paid $279.95 plus $17.95 shipping . len previously used placed back pouch sold new . len cap marred several scratches . looks handled rough . my advice bypass adorama third party vendor buy directly amazon . adorama refunds within 14 days less shipping . thats $17.95 me return used product sold new . won't go there again	1
we love this produc t.t ook me minutes hook up . so easy use . i understand total cost printing few cents more than what you get costco . but . its ease use home ! specially if u guests home .... you wanna give instant photos ... hmm .... cosco/walmart .... going christmas day ..... i dont think so !!!! my guests love it .... when we give them photos .... right after party ! everybody gets kick out it ! amazon ..... goog service ! time !!!	1
this camera excellent one !! really when you compare its price its results level quality you get you know why this best its category , i'm getting very professional results using it lot styles .. highly recommended	1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
my photography not much call wireless remote but this too easy pass up . it delivered advertised i am finding i am using it place wired remote ultra close up low light photagraphy when using tripod . it very small so it easy pack away anywhere	1
i like using tripod my long zoom lens , this device really added my hobby . remote perfect taking pictures birds my birdbath squirrels other critters my yard . i personally don't like cables , i don't like dealing them . this just right my purposes . remote also better taking pics people . it much better than timer my opinion since i move people out easier more efficiently , taking pictures more quickly . this gives me so much more control than using timer .	1
excellent camera high end capabilities . easy use intuitive system controls	1
my kids competitive tae kwon . i now used camera my wife gave me one year ago several tournaments . it able stop action take great shots even low lighting . now , we tried it when we went skiing it also worked great glare conditions snow . i bought monopod worked real well stabalize i use software called photofinale crop share photos . one year into usage i am still looking forward each chance i get play this " toy " . next options : battery grip , flash diffuser , extra remote flash ..	1
this lens produces magical images . i am stunned its sharpness , contrast color saturation . simply amazing ! this great option standard zoom aps-c cameras great wide-angle option full-frame . aps-c ussers , i sold my ef-s 17-85 usm because this just miles better . i simply love this lens ! i am now so sold difference makes , i also sold my telephoto lens 70-200 f4 l.i believe this great investment because : * canon lenses lose very little their value * should canon abandon aps-c sized sensor full-frame 35mm , then ef lens range make your kit far more future-proof * once initial sting price receded , you never regret quality images you take this lensjust try it - it awesome ! some reviewers call this slow lens - i would disagree . many zooms 3.5 - 5.6 , or perhaps 3.5 - 4.5 pro-sumer range . there virtually nothing 3.5 f4 , constant f-stop advantage . f4 not fast , but it certainly not slow , either	1
i also sb-600 this product , sb-800 , much better - worth extra $100 . it much easier use since it simple menu structure not wierd button combo selections sb-600 . flash output better , recycle time better you use flash commander other wireless flashes . also extra battery holder fifth battery reduces recycle time further never comes off my unit . diffusion head also included so you don't buy separate one stofen ... works great	1
nikon designed this unit exploit possibilities their latest digital slrs while still compatble their oldest f-series cameras . sb-800 more expensive than sb-600 , but it gives you more control more light . you may find more light critical if you want use bounce flash soften shadows . i would given sb-800 five stars if user manual little better . nikon obviously tried very hard provide good documentation , make user interface intuitive possible . but , unit so many features modes inevitably require effort learn , present cases where you working against built automation . expect make large number experimental shots if you really want learn how use this unit . my chief plea nikon would more straight forward explanation cameras like d50 not ttl flash . so called i-ttl uses pre flashes computation set up calculated flash rather than real time measurement during exposure quench flash . one would normally expect same result , but not if slave flash used . one beauties sb-800 , however , it used slave unit using its own sensor determine when master unit firing , even if ( case d50 using its built flash ) camera sb-800 not communicating i-ttl info via ir pulses	1
i say , semi-pro photographer , this one item made vast difference many my shots . it allowed me get studio like shots ( extent ) without use those giant studio flashes cost thousands dollars . i able just set up few hot lights use sb-800 off camera thanks amazingly wonderfull wireless feature got great quality shots what i needed . also , concert photographer , low light areas this works great especially since most tour managers don't take highly flash use , it allows me farther back get great shot since i know little more fill light work . sb-800 i say far one few products you won't regret paying high price . i originally thought getting 600 decided go all out get 800 after reading all featuers it sb-600 doesnt . this product , coupled my d70 dr-6 right angle viewfinder ( great investment you should all look into ) give me so many great shots , i say only design flaw sb-800 i can't use dr-6 while flash camera unless i buy bracketing system . most time though , when i am useing dr-6 i am angle where pop-up works just fine but there few times i wish i could use 800 well . so those who unsure this sb-600 , go this product . now all i find better lens then my sigma 28-300 i am all set . anyone know where find good deal 18-200mm nikor lens ? if so someone ( if there way ) please email or contact me i myspace search my companyhope this helps least one personbradpremier image	1
i'm amateur photographer , mediocre skills . this flash makes all my photos look better vs built-in , little no intervention my part . i use it digital rebel . i like flash varies intensity , depending ambient . time flashes reasonably quick ( particularly when ambient doesn't require full flash ) . avoid washed out faces , i'd always gotten accustomed bouncing flash off walls/ceiling ( my old camera setup ) . i've learned i don't need 420ex , almost always keep it directly pointed subjects ( unless i'm trying purposely create shadows across people faces ) . i also seem get much less redeye vs built	1
this flash working great me . it amazing recycle time . i able easily fire off multiple shots indoors low light without missing beat . i also used it completely dark room , all worked great . i don't like locks bounce head , it necessary press release side prior tilting . just minor annoyance	1
yes due released sept 05 updated new version this lens . it 70-300mm f/4- 5.6 lens new set up which viewed canon website . canon item number 0345b002 . msrp new version lens $649.99 i older version 75-300mm iii usm w/out i nothing but good things say lens ! ( i only paid $189.99 it ) can't wait this new version come out	1
owned 2 weeks : only thing cause me stop short 5 stars weight lens . stabilization great worth every dime . don't even think other 75-300mm non-is version , it junk - i tried it . you hand hold this lens 300 mm 1/60 !! no kidding . focus fast accurate my digital rebel - almost no hunting like other 75-300mm . you * must * get skylight filter protect front element . i'll update this review after few months ' use .	1
nick xu , if you can't figure out difference this lens , cheaper consumer grade lenses , all means , stay cheaper consumer grade lenses . after all , " mr magoo " cartoon fame couldn't tell chevy rolls royce . all kidding aside , this lens simply awesome use . one these lenses camera bag very close practice owning three or four high end prime lenses . yes , it good . i am using borrowed version right now , but soon i pay off my new 24-105 f/4 usm lens ( very , very awesome ) , i buy my own 70-200 f/ 2.8 usm . it good it gets this lens range , but if you feel comfortable pinhole camera , carry , it all end user . everyone else , this lens holy grail mid range telephoto lenses . it simply best available it range , responds well canon tele adapters . if you figure out way afford this lens , buy it , it all . if you nikon lover buy this lens anyway , buy fairly cheap 20d body make it work . it ok tell your friends you used nikon take pics , but you end up knowing canon premeir lens crafter 21'st century . ( sorry , nikon fans , but this lens stands all it self grand scheme things . it simply awesome . )	1
i love this camera ! i lot reading-up price-checking before i bought this item , i'm delighted quality product value money . this my first ' own camera ' i've almost zero camera experience , so find myself taking most amazing photos able edit/add text/e-mail them - well - wow ! i've stunned results this camera given , all within month purchase . basic handbook me taking quality ' normal ' photo within 24 hours , using this handbook i've progressed into some fantastic close-up stuff , some fun stuff too - get your spouse dress up sepia shots good laugh !! i've enormouse fun learning this camera - i've got loads more learn i feel some good camera work now within my grasp . this required modicom concentration diligence , but it paid off , precisely what i hoped . i found batteries came camera almost useless , but your quality name-brand batteries give excellent life - also , if you plan taking more than 15 pics time , you want memory card . oh yeah ! i'm ' old bird ' 53 years , so if i this , anyone :o	1
time this writing , there something wrong product shot amazon site : it makes lens look much shorter than it reality . it not large or heavy lens all , but it not _that_ short . i've mine ( part 20d kit ) year , during which i've taken maybe 4000 frames or so particular lens . lens still appears solid it day 1 , so no complaints departmen t.t he image stabilization ( ) feature works quite well surprisingly silent ( far more so than system ef 70-300mm ) . said , good fraction focal length range , relatively minor ( but still useful ) benefit this lens . autofocus ( af ) speed okay : better than kit lens came original digital rebel i used own , but not fast some other lenses i ( all non-l ) . af accuracy fine my copy . optically , my concern primarily sharpness . department , lens seems only marginally better than 18-55mm kit lens came original digital rebel ( which bought close $100 , i believe ) . it often worth turning off improve things , ironically . still , it not awful . i haven't found vignetting , distortion , flare , aberrations significant hindrances . part , probably due workflow includes dxo pro images i care . overall , i think this still pretty good choice lens keep default canon ef-s camera ( 30d , 20d , or digital rebel variant ) . optical performance over lower-end ef-s 18-55mm lens not _that_ great , but feature set may justify premium . higher end ef-s 17-55/ 2.8 alternative if you're willing double your investment change lenses get longer focal range : its imaging quality larger aperture certainly desirable . tamron sigma some offerings this range too , but i'm not all familiar them	1
i got this lens my 30d found it useful walkaround lens , able handle just any situation i threw it , other than very low-light situations . even dim illumination it able function fairly well , thanks image stabilization , which let me shoot shutter speeds slow 1/4 second hand-held . i wasn't thrilled barrel distortion wide end zoom range , but i able fix this using photoshop lens correction adjustment no problem . it simply additional post processing step that necessary	1
i got this lens replace kit lens came my canon eos 30d . this lens definitely more " substantial " lens than kit lens . even though outer housing plastic , it metal mount seems very durable sturdy . really helps improve image quality induced my unsteady hand . usm very fast quiet . i read accounts this lens not able lock , but i not any issues it varying ( including low ) lighting conditions . i know lens supports ftm focus , but i not tried it yet . i like focal length range this lens . 17mm even 1.6 multiplier , angle very wide . only drawback this lens me 17mm there significant barrel distortion . my test shots my next shot 24mm distortion completely gone this focal length . it not showstopper though since it easily corrected photoshop . all lenses i plan get , ( sigma 30mm 1.4 , canon ef 50mm 1.8 ii , canon ef 70-300mm usm ) , this most likely lens i keep camera most time , using others opportunities warrant	1
i am 6ft tall this such perfect tripod someone who beginning/novice photographer occasional moderate use ( would my guess ) . my fort� post-production , i am graphic designer needed something use my new dig camera . i lot research tripods this seemed what i needed my usage . plastic clips concern me somewhat durability long haul , but i would love surprised just my nerves luck talking . how you beat price regardless ? i am so happy this tripod so far . i love how tall it me particularly how easy it use . i so much research online found this 70 " one said " screw it " i am tired looking bought it . i knew i needed something accomodated my height there isn't whole lot out there us tall folks decent ratings hundred below dept . i didn't pesos make " hundred+ " purchase took risk here when i rated cost versus quality ( my head ) . i feel though i won this battle now . i like two " levels " ( i noticed ) make sure i am squared up this piece equipment . equipment smooth pan i using it my own photo work , video tours my husband realtor work recreation/family photos . i am excited use this more my dig rebel . legs extend easily . metal ( light weight ) body plastic clips pieces . comes black bag hold your tripod also . easy snap-off piece remove your digital camera attach . fact i just leave it always my camera it expedites process when i am hurry . tripod feels quite sturdy my rebel attached . i think this really good-looking tripod . it so so light weight portable . i love it not clunky loud assemble when pulling it straight out trunk/car quickly assembly . i would've liked seen manual recommended usage ways maximizing longevity product , but i am over it product great so far . ( revise 1 0-0 9-06 ) still love love this tripod . i use it all time . so easy use it so lightweight i just toss it trunk . so quick set up too . love it ... it rocks ( tall gal ) . :	1
i bought this battery canon 30d take around thousand pic one charge . very happy battery performance	1
some reason , canon- branded batteries better than those sold actual battery manufacturers . don't just look $$/mah ratio , consider safety , reliability longevity . these categories , canons rock . i bought g1 camera five years ago , camera toast , but battery still works like charm my 20d . others start out 1400 or even 1700 mah , but fail after six months - read reviews here amazon.com	1
i'm loyal canon fan who only 4 canon branded lenses ( though i great sigma 70-300 ) .. said , i'm huge fan opteka grip . canon just not worth extra money . excellent build quality it , batteries it came work very well ( more mah than std battery ) . i heard some complaints how far you depress shutter release grip -- it further than camera , but very usable , since purchasing i've heard similar complaints users canon grip . save $ grip , get opteka get other accessories ... you wont regret i	1
i bought opteka battery pack grip my canon eos digital rebel xti , bit leary considerably lower price than canon brand battery pack grip . i am pleased report opteka grip met my expectations . prosthe grip fits extremely well rebel xti . it even comes convenient place store battery compartment lid ( which must removed insert grip into camera . removing lid easy procedure ) . attaching grip quick easy , large , serrated wheel tighten grip against camera bottom . finish grip different than canon-brand grip . opteka thin , rubbery , texturized non-slip insert layer over front , bottom back . canon grip rubbery insert smooth looks more " finished . " my only concern opteka insert it shows signs it may not stay perfectly attached grip , likely need touch cement future . not big deal , though . vertical shooting buttons grip ( exposure bracket , a-e lock , auto focus point selection , selector wheel shutter release ) , far i tell , identically placed like those canon grip . all work like they supposed . grip comes " on-off " slide so you turn off vertical shooting buttons when they not needed . this prevents accidentally activating one buttons or taking picture if they inadvertently pressed while shooting horizontal . battery compartment grip very easy remove insert batteries . although i haven't used it yet , optional aa battery insert looks easy use , good emergencies . two nb-2lh batteries came grip seem ok , charged up just fine . battery came camera , i now 3 batteries use . more than enough number pictures i take during typical shoo t.t he grip certainly improves handling feel xti , which comes too-small grip many hands . personally , i like additional heft mass opteka grip gives camera , although some may object additional weight . consthis very minor point , but worth pointing out . shutter release button opteka grip bit " mushy . " what i mean it not always easy tell when you pressed shutter releae halfway down activate auto focus or metering . there noticable tactile difference pressing shutter release down camera , shutter release grip . it if spring underneath camera shutter release button bit stiffer than one grip . however , if you use viewfinder determine whether you achieved focus or not , then little bit mush grip shutter release won't make no never mind . bottom linewould i recommend this grip friend ? yes . would i buy one if need arises ? yes	1
i both canon version grip this version . they identical . i two rebel xts they work great . i like them feel it gives holding camera . camera small my hands this makes it perfect . if you thinking buying accessories rebel xt , this should one them . grip holds two batteries , which gives you way more shooting time . i highly recommend this	1
good quality , perfect attach , but no cord avoid loose it . incredible canon forget it !!! so ... remember put it inside your pocket when you use your camera	1
just sure get case it , because large screen could get scratched	1
i bought this camera two weeks ago , taken 100 pics , my battery still nearly fully charged . i thought i'd buy battery when i decided buy this camera , but i'm glad i held off , because it not necessary ( unless you're going two-week excursion bush no access electricity ... ) no problems red-eye , no blurry pictures when taken inside low light , outstanding battery life . i am getting more than i expected when i purchased this camera . i would recommend it ( show it off ! ) anyone	1
i am new slrs i cant belive how good this camera . this camera worth every penny amazing quality it produces . i always thot my old digital pics point shoot excellent , but looking back , they look terrible compared this .	1
it extremely easy use . hard figure out menu , but once there no problem . takes beautiful pictures . great action shots well . seldom find blurry photo it stabelizer built	1
this great product . i rather large lens it helps stabilize it so i don't blur my pictures when i'm taking pictures kids playing soccer . however , people think i'm professional photographer local newspaper when i use it grandkids ' games .	1
it works fine , but canon s2 digital camera sometimes feels little heavy monopod .	1
if you've found these reviews , you already know this lens one best canon products out there . i not bite version , i not found myself ever wishing i ; this lens everything it hyped up performs well low-light/indoor situations . i don't think it weight big deal . i really don't any problem carrying this lens around day -- my hands or bag -- even 1.4 extender attached . it feel bit heavy but i don't mind , neither you when you see results later . i've used this lot shooting professional baseball it landed me front page ink several times . my mind , i could get 1.4 extender this lens give myself 70-280 range , which pretty adequate most sports nature photography , considering 300 f/ 2.8 it friends much , much more expensive . lens works basically just fast sharp , my opinion , 1.4 f/4 , although some may debate this . flip any baseball or football game you see this lens around neck most every pro . if you swing price , enjoy it ! my advice continue reading up this or similar products , although i found most everyone agreed , this one finest lens around . it one makes people stop stare wonder who you	1
this probably canon best value mid/long zoom . i got this same day i purchased my 30d ... ef-s 10-22 ef 24-70 2.8 . talk pleased ! no regrets whatsoever . this lens just screams quality . images just pop out you . if you're considering f/4 model ... take hard look this one . add hood ( cha-ching ) ( yikes ) $100+ tripod ring value this lens really shows . it bit larger heavier but look what you gain ! if you're one those considers sweet spot lens stopped down step or two just look where puts you f/4 compared this one . focus speed nothing short " holy mackerel that fast ! " sure , you could spend few more bucks get version ... but frankly , me least , if it important i'll using tripod anyway . hmmm , just took shakes out equation . all all , great lens decent price	1
my cousin wife professional studio photographer who occasionally lends out her lenses me clothing / lifestyle photoshoots ( i've pretty active this area some time , just now starting go full digital ) , i've used f/ 2.8 four or five times this one best lenses i've used . period . shooting wide open allows you retain high shutter speeds night shots , well get very interesting vibrant long shutter shots ( crowds , freeway night , etc ) . when shooting action shots , tripod mount get way zooming focusing , but it removed easily enough . i personally just purchased f/ 4.0 , which , coupled relatively wide max aperture shooting either 1600 or 3200 my 20d , should nicely , but i still rate 2.8 high up my list	1
excellent product , easy use , great edging cards making trims cards craftwork . i can't wait experiment it	1
i've my d70s year now , haven't regretted it second . controls laid out logically , everything hand . dual control wheels make adjustments fast accurate . i personally love optional grid overlay , i no excuses horizons aren't horizontal . wireless flash system great , though you buy sb-600 or sb-800 get full benefit . this camera bigger heavier than d50 d80 , which my opinion positive thing .	1
d70s minor update original d70 introduced 2004 , few new features slightly larger lcd . it still great camera , but expect it replaced new d80 , which 40 percent more pixels , 2.5 -inch lcd , additional useful features old price d70s . so , you probably save little money still purchase sophisticated digital slr if you wait until prices d70s stabilize new , lower level . , say , $600 , this camera would incredible bargain . d70s shined one best cameras its class since its introduction . example , it 1/500th second flash synch speed ( found no other camera but d50 ) so you keep ambient light under control avoid ghost images . its autofocus fast accurate , features both single-autofocus , continuous-autofocus ( tracking action ) , novel " automatic " autofocus mode switches af-s af-c required . if you no nikon lenses , get this camera 18-70mm kit lens , which very sharp versatile , rather than more limited 18-55 lens . you won't regret it	1
i bought this grip year ago after shooting homecoming weekend my school , central michigan university . pain it saved my wrist able shoot sports vertically without hang my hand over top my camera huge relief . recently though , after year solid use , i've problems it . there days my camera suddenly say my batteries dry - after charging them day before . i've checked , my grip not part series recalled similar problem . i actually removed grip , batteries , restart camera correct problem . -- this big problem middle sports match -- however , grip great addition 20d/30d models . it not same feel using 1d , but it close you're going get . $150 , you can't go wrong vertical shooting doubled battery life . it also simply evens out weight camera , especially heavier l-glass lenses your camera	1
i recently purchased this use my 550ex . if you use alot flash event photography , you want this your kit . it expensive , but i think it worth every penny . it keep you changing aas your strobe it quickens recycle times nearly instant . you shoot bursts still get proper flash exposure . you attach strap sling it over your shoulder or slip it your belt . mounting my 20d just not comfortable . it gets way hand-grip	1
yes , it overpriced , just like any specialty item . yes , screw attachment bottom camera useless . but when you need fast recycle times or hundreds flashes go , cp-e3 invaluable . you strap case light stand or flash bracket , coiled cord length adequate these uses . i use elegantly compact really right stuff flash bracket which no place attach cp-e3 , so battery back without its case slips into my shirt or pants pocket . case could also strapped your bel t.t he unit little weighty 8 rechargeable aa batteries aboard , i'd hate see how many pieces this plastic gizmo would break into if i dropped it hard surface . top tunnel strap hang it something , strap should included . i made loop some hiking boot shoelaces ( which i also make zipper pulls ) i hang it knob light stand when shooting studio set-up . without short recycle times cp-e3 allows , my 580ex flash would gotten only one shot my daughter bowing after playing her piece piano recital . instead , i got three . decide yourself how important kind thing	1
i bought this because i needed top recycle speed my 550ex flash unit without spending huge bundle . i shoot karate demos my eos rebel digital , lots fast action rather large space ( meaning many full power flashes ) . digital rebel set iso800 mode flash set +1 stop exposure i adequately cover action basketball court sized gymnasium . using this battery pack 2000mah aa sized batteries ( 6.50 set 4 walmart ) i've taken over 400 pictures no slow down cycle speed . this particular pack uses 8 aa cells compatible lithium ion cells . older version this unit used 6 cells i believe , not compatible lithium ion batteries . unit very simple . box light it , space strap ( though none included ) slide out battery tray locking button course connector coiled cord hooks into side flash unit . i'm sure they it reasons resistance , but cord kinda short , thus limiting you where you hang battery package . if your tripod socket free they include screw designed mount battery package bottom camera ( kinda useless if you ask me ) . battery box comes fairly nice padded nylon case includes velcro strap , this what i use hang battery package camera or bag strap it works fine . eventually i'll get around finding something i use strap worry me less ( 8 batteries this thing it bit heavy trusted velcro if you ask me ) . unit works way it intended but i think price exhorbitant hunk plastic , price should half what it . if you can't go all-out buy top end rechargeable battery or true professional ( what they used call 512 ) battery package then this enough most us	1
my first lens . very sharp solid build . canon dr amazon gc , you get it lower $400 !!	1
like canon ef 17-40 f4l usm , this it sister $100 cheaper boot ! excellent images f4 ! outstanding images f9 . lightweight combination canon 5d . even lighter more compact combination canon digital rebel t.t he only gripe i purchase optional expensive tripod collar ring . ring add bit noticeable weight . since i am not steady shooter , i upgrading canon ef 70-200 f4l usm when it available november this year . least tripod collar ring should fit newer weathersealed lens .	1
this lens i use most often . it unbeatable portraits low-light photos indoors etc . it very sharp relatively light small . i also found it useful aerial photography . i used 50 mm 1.8 but upgraded because i like extra low-light power 1.4 ( which i often use ) one-touch usm manual focus distance scale ( which just nice-to-have ) . said , 1.8 great lens too	1
lens great ! i'm using it my eos 20d , shots beautiful . wide open setting ( 1.4 ) , depth field amazing provides absolutely outstanding boquet . this lens definitely worth difference price over 1.8 . boquet much better . little advice : avoid using auto focus your camera when using this lens ... its too easy catch any little thing front or behind what you intending focus , you see difference , just small difference depth . manually , lens provide you perfect shots every time ! its well worth extra few seconds make sure shot composed correctly	1
this monopod very sturdy easy set up . i looking monopod capable handling weight my large canon lens ( over 3 lbs ) , this one job very well . i mainly use it taking soccer pictures , so far , i'm very pleased . i highly recomend it	1
price went up !!! great value money spent . buying " ball " attachment better adjustability . got some great steady shots 48x digital zoom canon s2 i	1
this camera so user friendly versatile ! 8 megapixel resolution , pics sharp clear ! honestly best camera i've ever !! great buy cost all us non-professional users	1
kodak p880 remarkable bargain produces astonishing photos . its 8 megapixels zoom lens it operates like more expensive slr . quality photos , even highest zoom , astounding . anyone interested easy operate , high quality camera , this one	1
this third 8 meg sd camera i tried - it only one without using tripod indoors gave me sharp , crisp pictures most time . zoom smaller fuji or panasonic , but color saturation sharpness heads shoulders above others . excellent camera shoots jpg , tiff raw	1
this filter works great . i used this filter nikon 18-70mm lens produced excellent pictures . i yet experience any flare this polarizer . great polarizer great price	1
this review personal experience . i recently picked up d200 replace my d70 . this past weekend i took photos my sister wedding . i shot full functionality using lcd review every shot using nikon 18-200 vr lens . over course wedding reception i took 295 photos fine jpeg mode reviewed them while shooting . end afternoon , i still battery life left very likely could taken 100 more photos . given features capability d200 , i absolutely no issue many photos . i pick up second battery back up soon someone some stock . i could not agree more previous reviewer . if you not personal experience this product , there no need attempt review it based hearsay or something you might read elsewhere	1
this excellent camera . i upgraded eos 20d which also great camera . i upgraded couple reasons . first full frame sensor . eos 20d 1.6 crop factor which effects your lenses overall focal length . eos 5d you get true focal length your attached lens . just like film slr cameras . awesome ! one problem i've noticed full frame sensor eos 5d it huge . when you changing lenses this sensor picks up every little piece dust , dirt fibers like vacuum . i'm constantly cleaning sensor blower . i also bring it canon service center . just remove some dust off sensor my blower could not remove . canon service center very far my home . ( very annoying ) . i never experienced this problem eos 20d . but , images you get full frame sensor far superior smaller sensor eos 20d . other reason i upgraded larger lcd . 2.5 ' lcd screen nice plus . images look bright sharp . overall i love this camera . build , features image quality excellent !!!	1
con:i've own this now 6 months , i shoot weddings portraits . i alot tests , especially picture modes . well don't waste your time these , their all bad , theexception landscape . you'll just end up using standardmode best all arround shooting . venetting accure arround edges , mostly low light . worst all color ballance or white ballance auto mode . what ever reason it hard time . my d60 out performs it here big time , not sure why . so you may shoota grey card get your white ballance more accurate . pros : quality pic excellent , color saturation awsome . blow up 2'x3 ' excellent detail , no noise . i've found focus mine real good , no problems here . ease use after learning curve becomes easy , just read manuel . conclusion : i would buy again except awb problem . now i owned both d60 10d neither seemed this problem bad . i use this mode when doing weddings because i'm always move go one differn't light sorce inbetween shots ( tungsten daylight ) . i still think canon best alway buy their products	1
i switched digital rebel xt . since i already l-glass lenses , i didn't run into problems 5d " exposing " cheaper lenses . 17-40mm really shines full sensor ! burst rate simply astonishing . missing flash doesn't bother me , heck it $3000 camera , i don't expect built-in flash . i speedlite 580ex , which course wonderful itself . i also battery grip which i recommend , well rs-80n3 cable release . image quality superb overall - 5d really shines high iso numbers - more so than even 1d what i've read . even 1600 there hardly any noise . it allows you take great , crisp photos low light where other cameras would require flash . camera also quite light while very sturdy same time . 3 fps might bother some , but i prefer incredible burst numbers .	1
i bought canon eos 20d digital slr canon ef 75-300mm zoom lens take photographs my children various sporting events . magnification factor this lens perfect variety sporting events including lacrosse , basketball , swimming gymnastics . focusing speed very good capturing action shots . i highly recommend this lens affordable general purpose zoom lens	1
i just begun my interest photography this first zoom lense i ever bought . lense provided all i could ever ask . i just got back zoo kids photographes excellent	1
all reviews this lens all true . it great lens . i love quality it . however , if you like take door photoes don't very big rooms , you might want consider 50mm f/ 1.4 . i mostly find my self backed up corner trying take picture home	1
i recently bought this lens amid trepidation 85mm focal length would overwhelm 1.6 crop factor my digital rebel xl . my worries needless : just step or two back subject plus some getting used telephoto perspective enough turn this lens into most effective portrait lens i . when attached my eos elan 7n film camera , however , lens really truly comes into its own , full frame 35mm slr delivers entire focal range this lens . focused image incredibly crisp compared any other non-l grade lens . i agree this lens deserves red ring courage around it , like lenses . this glass absolutely essential very short list affordable lenses , should give many non-affordable ones run their money . solidly built too , old-fashioned no-nonsense look it . i highly recommend it	1
monopod functions i hoped price excellent dea	1
it everything it reported . it works very well . we take it every trip we take	1
my mom lost her usb cable her digital camera amazon always everything i need so i order it her	1
item just what i needed hook my camera my computer start downloading photos . it unpacked , plugged working less then minute	1
we received our usb cable promptly . you know kodak usb cables special they not fit any other regular devices uses usb cable . these usb cables kodak only . product itself turned out everything it represented	1
great case . small , soft , compact , extra space batteries . however , hole camera strap center , which means if your camera strap attaches anywhere other than middle camera , it doesn't line up this case . minor detail . example , strap a530 near top camera , so strap goes out side case , unless you pull it sideways go through case hole .	1
i never take my uv filter off my lens unless i am going immediately put different filter . there basically two camps out there , those feel you should always use uv filter protect your lens dirt scratches those feel it waste time only degrades your image . well , i tried going without one awhile then dirt started build up front element my very expense lens . although you clean front element lens , i feel much , much safer wiping my comparatively cheap uv filter time time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage . i think nearly unquantifiable loss image quality you may suffer uv filter , it well worth extra piece mind it gives me	1
this also correct lens hood new ef 70-300mm f4- 5.6 usm lens . 4 stars because it $40 piece plastic should included both its intended lenses . shame your cheap ways , canon	1
i am generally pleased this lense , if i could only carry one lense my digital rebel , this one i would take	1
this great lens if you need shoot wide angle very low light siuations . if you don't need lens this exact purpose , you'd better off spending few extra dollars either 16-35l or 24-70l . these two zoom lenses cover 24mm ( more ) very reasonable 2.8 good results . they won't bag shot shadows , but they handle any decently lit scenario ease . if you just own 1.4 prime lens , 35mm 1.4 much more universally well-regarded lens than 24mm 1.4 . 50mm 1.4 1/3 price either just amazing my opinion so long you don't need wide angle . only reason i give 24mm 1.4 4 instead 5 price	1
i've bought several lenses adorama , two which include new 300/ 2.8 other , this 500/4 . all their deliveries prompt well packed . i zero complaints them . i dealt john ( green , i think his last name ) via email . i highly recommend them . this lens , it incredible . wide open it creates wickedly sharp subject against wonderfully soft background ( good bokeh ) . af very fast . this lens extremely good still af when used 1.4 converter . ( af works up 5.6 .	1
good advice other reviewer picture . said i three these really wouldn't want without them . these clean my camera screen glass my lenses without scratch every time . my opinion almost must your bag ! good luck	1
this really handy lens your bag . i added this lens my collection several months ago , i haven't regretted it one bit . i took trip montana august used this lens photograph ton wildflowers . i also using 70-300mm telephoto lens 24-70mm wide angle lens heavily , but most my favorite shots trip taken this lens . autofocusing very quiet since it usm powered , but it often tricky get right focus if you're doing extreme closeup . this general facet macro lenses , so you'll probably find yourself using manual focus 90% time or more . manual focus this lens quite excellent though , responds well fine adjustments . it also quite easy me handhold it , long i decent amount light or pop up flash . all said , this nice lens grab after you decent telephoto lens , if you like photographing small things . otherwise , you might look into getting some other lenses first , i.e. wide angle , fisheye , etc . ( unless you already own all them :-))	1
i use it my s70 .. it works over 10meters ( thats right ! ) back too , so i am very happy it .. i bought it today so maybe it improved now ..	1
i purchased this camera year ago ( summer 05 ) . definitely great upgrade over original rebel , although new xti larger screen which one aspect this camera not perfect . there other sites perform more comprehensive reviews this camera , but after year mine still working perfectly	1
i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camera , its beyond description ...	1
when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
best camera i ever owned . easy use even all features . don't afraid buy this one	1
i bought this little camera recently amazon . thanks tremendous service speedy delivery , amazon . sony dsc-w100 terrific . it very simple operate . menu system well-organized easy understand . inserting battery memory card snap . zeiss lens system yields incredibly sharp photos even automatic setting . flash pretty powerful , too ! i took some shots rather dark restaurant , pictures came out really nice clear . macro function superb crisp , well-defined details very close range . powerup time this camera fast well time shots . there very little shutter lag , you usually get picture you intended get . autofocus little slower until it " finds " target perfectly certain situations . but this no big deal compared older digicams . i like able switch quickly viewing pictures replay mode back camera mode simply tapping shutter release button lightly . you quickly ready picture . camera not miniature weighs nearly six ounces , which not extremely light -- but comfortable carry or place purse or pocket . i also canon digital rebel xt , this little camera take sharper pictures . course , you not versatility slr , but it great everyday camera take you all shots you would otherwise miss . i highly recommend this camera recommend purchase amazon . update : i now used this camera video mode . wow . it produces incredibly sharp videos fast frame rate looks terrific our television . multi-purpose cable supplied camera allows usb 2.0 audio/video hookup . you must decide what zoom level before you start shooting your video because once you start , you cannot zoom out . if you 1 gb memory stick pro duo you take 12 minutes video . i want get 2 gb pro duo stick which allows almost 25 minutes video . this would ideal take when you want switch still video shots keep your video shots consistent consecutive order . you must use pro duo stick high quality ( fine ) video mode	1
bought one these year ago . works same canon battery i got camera . i alternate canon lenmar batteries haven't noticed any difference	1
product top quality product . filters work excellent my canon powershot s2 . without doubt , worth every penny , especially considering price i paid it , which least half where i saw it listed other places . very happy purchase	1
backpack holds all my stuff extra room . only thing i thought i ordering bag not backpack based picture shown . backpack little heavy side me but i like it	1
i've many camera bags over years , this one seems fit bill best . it roomy - carries camera body one lens , plus charger , extra batteries , manual , memory card , room lens or two . i wouldn't say it would able hold more than three lenses . we recently took this trip st. lucia it held up well , even repelling some unexpected rain . we very pleased . size perfect - roomy but not overly bulky . i'd highly recommend this bag !	1
bag suppose hold two cameras , i rebel two lens cant fit them lens filters extra batteries . i recomend you buy bigger bag it not meet billing here . might good couple point shoot cameras but not sl	-1
battery pack arrived quite quickly , we delighted paying far less it than manufacturer charging product works just fine	1
i received short amount time just what i needed . this way i am able my camera turned almost full day using this backup nothing worse than needing little more time able get enire family reunion unable add last family into scrapbook but this cured it all	1
sure beats price buying polarizer , uv 2 nd filters individually	1
i this bag year recommend it . i use it all time . it great walkaround bag . first time you're place where you want get your camera quickly or don't want put your bag down you'll appreciate sling design . just aware long mountain hike you may feel weight your shoulder after some time . my only error getting 100 - i should gone 200 , plan so . i like keep my lens hood place which requires little more room . i'd also found i need little more room non-camera things . word all-weather cover - great feature . few weeks ago i bermuda walked beach 25 minutes away . just i arrived soaking rain began didn't let up entire walk back . if i hadn't able pull cover my equipment would soaked . now i wouldn't buy bag without one	1
this my first review amazon because i've bought products never really felt like they deserved review . i would say i thorough search bag would fit me . i nikon d50 18-55mm lens 70-300mm zoom lens . i originally large nikon bag pain carry around . it inconvenient carry access my camera . so when searching bag i wanted something compact , easy carry , could hold my gear neatly securely , my camera easily accessible those moments when you want take quick shot put it right back . i went camera stores tried bags , looked all over internet reviews finally came across lowepro slingshot 100aw . it everything i looking plus more . besides able hold my camera gear , it able hold my battery charger , cleaning supplies , extra batteries , filters , built all weather cover . even all packed i still space my wallet , cellphone keys , thus freeing up my pants pockets . great thing bag it able give me extra stability when taking photos when bag slung around front me . bag so well designed there no worry bag opening up all your expense gear fall out . opening where you remove camera straps prevent it opening all way accident . all all i am very satisfied bag . i would recommend it anyone but if you more than couple lenses your photography arsenal i would upgrade slingshot 200aw .	1
i love this remote . i find it very convenient take self portraits night time long exposure shots . unfortunately i lost remote during my trip smokies still no clue how where - might slipped my pocket hurry . i ordered second one now . it so tiny you not feel weight or volume your pocket or camera bag . i wish it strap/thread or hole so it attached key chain or camera or etc .	1
i use it my nikon d70 , am very satisfied it . i most often use it long exposures , taking picture include myself , taking pictures my 6-month old daughter , who stops acting naturally when she notices i hold camera , so i place it tripod , take pictures her .	1
i agree all others comments this lens . it works great but it big , heavy attracts attention . when i say it attracts attention , i am not kidding . i airshow taking pictures lot other amature photographers . my 100-400mm lens , however , attracted attention local newpaper reporter who interviewed me . however , i bought it use my 20d airshows i honestly say i am not disapointed . it well worth money . i also bought cheap kenko 1.5 teleconverter kicks . while converter isn't " " grade , i am pleased results autofocus still works which i understand not case canon tcs . those looking big zoom lens you want , you ulitimately going wind up buying this lens .	1
reviews this lens web mixed some showing soft results , particularly 400mm . this likely due wide variations sample lenses . i decided take chance seem gotten lucky . my copy , just received amazon ( build date oct 2005 ) produces fantastically crisp contrasty images my 20d all focal lengths 100 400 . it almost magical . images much sharper using same f-stops than those 70-200 2.8 lens 100-150mm virtually same 200mm . even wide-open 400mm this lens quite sharp . 400mm , i've compared very nice canon 400mm 5.6 prime lens , without 1.4 teleconverter . images virtually same extreme sharpness contrast if zoom stopped down just one one-third stop ( e.g. zoom 6.3 , prime 5.6 ) . 1.4 tc both lenses manually focused but produced outstanding clarity no perceivable loss quality . focus swift true this lens really works ( not hum like 70-200 2.8 ) allowing handheld shots 1/100 sec 400mm . it may canon quietly improved this lens since recent reviews seem much more positive than those few years ago . some folks don't like push-pull zoom but it works great me allows very fast composition scenes . lens same size 70-200 2.8 but seems lighter better balanced . given razor sharpness its images 100-400mm range , this seems like perfect single lens solution nature bird photography . however , it big white so it may not best candid people photography .	1
i purchased lowepro slingshot 200 replace tamrac adventure 7 backpack i recently returned amazon . i spent quite few hours researching bags use sightseeing/hiking initially purchased tamrac bag b/c its similarity ( style ) regular backpack . recent " series " purchase encouraged me keep low profile when transporting my gear . while tamrac bag certainly looked part , its functionality left something desired . adventure 7 held my entire kit , which includes : canon digital rebel xt , ef24-105mm " " , ef50mm ef18-55mm " kit " lenses , ex580 flashgun various hoods/filter/etc above lenses . now bad part , once strapped into its normal position , only way access your gear ( adven . 7 pack ) fully remove backpack , place it ground , unzip zipper fully , then remove/replace camera/gear you desire . this proved very cumbersome while rocky terrain " great falls " national park va ( near dc ) , fact , there times when i gave up few nice photo opportunities simply b/c getting camera would too difficult . i own lowepro holster , but going route , i would limited my ability bring alternate lenses/accessories . after some additional research , i decided try slingshot 200 . let compare tow some key points : gear capacity : nearly identical both bagsadditional capacity : tamrac trumps lowepro , it nearly double useable storage capacity , great bringing snack , your keys , etc . styling : again , tamrac winner , looks like standard backpack , versus strange look slingshotfunctionality : backpack , tamrac much more comfortable , greater storage capacity even offers waist support strap longer trips . but , this comes cost accessibility . lowepro slides easily around front . simply unzip your camera right there . it also stable platform lens changing/cleaning/etc . summarize : hiking/walking/etc where you need instant access your camera accessories , lowepro slingshot 200 wins hands down . pros : instant access your gear , includes all-weather cover ( attached ) , nice attention details ( lens cleaning/protection cloth particularly nice touch ) , etc . cons : strange styling , not reversible ( only worn right shoulder ) , nearly impossible carry hanging one shoulder .	1
case opens partially side allow removal camera only . then after unclicking fasteners you unzip rest case allow access lenses . it makes it easy if you only want remove camera . you swing bag around while wearing it pull camera out without taking off pack . my digital rebel xt fits canon battery grip my macro lens attached , however it would not fit my 200mm lens attached . my canon speedlight flash not fit well lense section but fits perfectly separate section top portion bag . lenses all fit nicely allowing several lenses depending size them . i bought regular lowepro camera bag , but found it awkward place camera lens attached . this bag designed camera lens . if you search google images lowepro slingshot 200 you see what i mean side unzipping allow camera removal .	1
if you believer protecting your expensive lens purchase filter than you lot worse than tiffen filter . glass quality good price reasonalbe . filter cuts down glare adversly effect some shots out uv filter advertised . not much else say .	1
great filter price-no reason spend more . filter threads high quality , it possible stack filters if you want-not recommended , though , if you using it wide-angle , i am . no vignetting , sturdy filter .	1
this fantastic lens . it takes crisp , rich photos , large apperature makes impressive low-light photography , includes usm technology lightening-fast focusing . since i am only serious hobbyist , i can't yet afford quality canon lens ... but 2 years i perfectly happy leave this lens camera ( 10d ) . portraits , landscapes , indoor shots no flash ... it them all ease , photos look grea t.t his lens little heavy , combined my 10d weight certainly consideration . but me it feels well-balanced camera , i like substantial feel lens-camera combination gives . if you plan use flash , remember this big lens built-in flash may not clear barrel ( especially 10d , before canon redesigned pop-up flash ) ... might want think external flash head hot shoe . there lot glass front this lens , don't forget uv filter little extra protection	1
my all-around favorite lens canon eos system 50/ 1.4 . i find most time , most pictures i want take achieved using hte 50mm focal length , fast aperture allows me take photos low light . i bought 24-70/ 2.8 hopes getting high quality images zoom lens , lot my pictures weren't particularly dark places , flexibility get little wider or closer sounded appealing . i not disappointed . image quality produced 24-70/ 2.8 outstanding . great color , great sharpness . it might not make images quite striking canon 135/2 lens , but they very good indeed . this lens replace 50/ 1.4 ? no way . 50 lot smaller , weighs lot less , still much better low light shooting . but photographing events where you don't want lug around several prime lenses or go extreme lenghts frame shot better , 24-70 great tool	1
you buying quality not price . im amazed quality pictures i get my new lens . it seems i changed my camera new model ... totaly diferent pictures . i compared my previous cameras lenses wow ... i cant believe i thought i some great pictures my collection . i dont want use my other lenses anymore , i new standard my pictures . i say it " crazy " decision buy this lens because price , but this investment once you it you enjoy last many years . if you love photography really like go full detail you wont regret it	1
i already 2 smaller versions other lenses but wanted sure my efs 17-85-mm would snug bug its own pouch instead cheap felt sling thing . well , canon came through again its soft felt line lp1116 . this pouch thick same firm bottom made naugahide protects inside lens . cord strong silky doesn't open accidently way silky cord would . obviously we can't throw pouch around we careful but it really trick feels good your hand . moment i buy lens , i shall buy its matching pouch	1
i not actually taken this underwater yet , but it appears well made similar quality other cases . it keeps theover-all size camera/case down size could fit into bc pocket . downside , it only limited functionality camera through available buttons . you zoom telephoto , change camera , playback movie mode shoot picture . you cannot any setup functions while it case . regarding stobe , sony makes one looks little cheezy . there " universal " strobe sea life ( sl 960d ) fits , but fiber-optic trigger just taped onto flash camera . i'm waiting how this works . one replacement o-ring comes case-replacements sony outrageously expensive . color-correcting ( red ) lenses $100 sony , but not needed if you use strobe . ( unless maybe shoot movies ? )	1
i lot research picking out camera wish i known this camera before purchasing nikon p3 ( wifi ) . i happened receive refurbished sd700 right before our honeymoon took both test them out . what better place than kauai take some great shots ... so , after first day shooting i came conclusion canon better camera hands down !!! matter fact it best camera i've owned i'll never get brand again . there several things set this camera apart others : 1 . picture quality scene modes ( beautiful beach floral mode)2 . picture quality auto ( true sign good camera)3 . 4x zoom ( unbelievable - best feature ... took pictures lighthouse mile away looked like i right front taking it . i also used camera binoculars see mountain goat wimea canyon picture unbelievably clear)4 . battery life5 . user controls softwarei really can't find anything bad say this camera . i didn't get chance even read manual before our trip figured out all " bells whistles " fairly easily . point shoot camera , this canon delivers professional quality like no other ! definitely great purchase	1
i love this camera . it everything you'd want compact point shoot camera . perfect taking pictures my toddler . fits your pocket starts up split second . never miss " kodak moment " .	1
obviously , i am enamored nikon d80 . one who extensively used d100 , d70s , d200 , i curious how d80 would " shake out " comparison these fine cameras . answer it very well indeed . most obvious improvement d80 over d70s d100 upgrade 6.1 10.2 megapixels -- same its " big brother , " d200 this not major issue many users , 6.1 mp image ( uncropped ) looks essentially exactly same 10.2 mp image . however , if user intends crop images post-processing , larger amount resolution becomes importan t--t he more megapixels more detail when images cropped . shooters wildlife , example , appreciate additional resolution d80 , it often necessary photograph wildlife distance then crop image cause subject dominate frame . other very obvious d80 improvements larger viewfinder larger rear-lcd . these very welcome improvements , also borrowed d200 . viewfinder wide , bright , literal joy use . combined 11-point autofocus system ( basically same d200 although some differences options ) viewfinder makes d80 powerhouse camera moving subjects , or framing subject places other than center image . autofocus fast sure . i literally never use manual focus d80 -- autofocus just too good not use almost every conceivable situation . 2.5 inch rear lcd bright vivid -- joy use . this too , mentioned above , borrowed d200 . menu selections d80 closely track those d200 largely pretty intuitive anyone who somewhat familiar nikon system . few nits . first all , d80 not selection focus-priority continuous focus mode . this unfortunate , such option ( present d200 ) allows fast action shots using continuous-focus surety subject , fact , focus . happily , this absence ( which i predict hope nikon correct later firmware revision ) not huge loss . i shot hundreds images fast-flying birds using continuous focus d80 images almost all perfectly focused . user trust d80 continuous focus mode , focus priority or no . nikon chose equip d80 sd cards rather than cf cards . why nikon this mystery many us d80 clearly upgrade wonderful d70s , which uses cf cards . further , d80 fantastic backup camera d200 users , d200 , course , also uses cf cards rather than sd cards . cf cards would more logical choice my opinion d80 . fortunately , cost these media dropping so fast this less issue than it would few years ago . d80 sucks up power lot faster than d70s . 2.5 inch lcd entails higher power use price . most users want own spare battery . ergonomics , d80 terrific ! i just finished 8 day stay maui , hawaii , during which my d80 literally always me . weight camera low , its bulk , reasonable . there no digital slr i would rather carry extended period than compact d80 . placement various controls excellent , pretty intuitive . quality d80 body construction standard nikon-prosumer grade , which say , excellent albeit not heavy-duty metal-body d200 . overall , d80 destined become one great nikon cameras find place users all over world	1
i recently test drove d200 impressed useabiity camera . it almost perfect . when buying i opted d80 because it very similar feature-set less cash . which meant additional money lenses . ok , it doesn't shoot 5fps or alloy body weather seals , but it sensor useability . it light , quick joy use . changing settings such iso , wb flash almost easy d200 . this fine camera . it uses sd cards - much more preferable than cf my opinion . worth every penny	1
this camera awesome ! i upgraded my d50 better sensor more mp . wow - am i amazed increase quality . say goodbye digital look . extras lot fun i've only begun play . b/w various filters name one . very worth money	1
first all i not consider myself anything more than very beginning photographer !!! so i not go into anything technical . i leave people who know more than i . but what i am international traveler . i simply got tired coming home fantastic trips " snapshots " . i wanted someting much better , boy i get it this camera . i looked d70s since i very small hands , i could never feel comfortable holding it . this camera smaller without small . i only taken photos locally , but this time year leaves changing it makes good start . built editing features ( filters etc . ) wonderful work . i would highly recommend this camera anyone who wants something more than " point shoot " snap shots	1
camera more advanced photographer very detailed instruction booklet . takes excellent photos auto mode . memory chip included not near big enough	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
this item good companion use battery backup ; i recommend this item all people using digital rebel xt . this battery long life after full charge , very light small piece you accommodate into any pocket or bag , i'm very satisfied this purchase	1
i am certainly happy i bought this filter kit . starting photographer , price right , i not noticed any quality issues . uv filter stays lens all times , it cheaper replace filter , than it scratched lens element repaired . light polarizer very handy , also works very well , cutting down greatly glare . i not yet occasion use warming filter yet . filter case nice extra , it fits right my camera bag , out way untill i need it	1
great kit ! i haven't used any filters before but i tell i'll using these quite bit	1
this camera case exactly what i looking . it fits my canon sd600 perfectly . it fits like glove- not too big , not too snug , it not scratch lcd screen . it really cute nice punch color contrast basic black every other camera case out there . i've gotten lot compliments how cute it . i definitely recommend this product !	1
i love this product ! case slim enough carry around purse without taking up all room . red color fun , too !	1
i mainly use this when taking landscape shots where i want either make clouds pop or liven sky up some ( remember it works best 90 degrees sun . ) i also put it when shooting highly reflective vegetation or waterscapes would otherwise cause blown-out highlights . one other little secrete use this when shooting waterfalls since it allow you shoot slower shutter speeds thus increasing wispy waterfall look	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet .	1
this little camera may small ( great feature ) but it loaded this goodies . this my first adventure into digital photography i would recomend this one any first time user . very easy lots fun use .	1
i 580ex it works great . i hopeing it would work studio light but nope so dont try it . only thing you mindful distince flash subject	1
i this camera year now am very impressed . i used nikon 35mm slr all my life so i little hesitant going into digital . lugging around equipment became too much issue so i started looking . picture quality great even full optical zoom . i very rarely use digital zoom . most impressive ... camera taken 2 direct hits concrete ( 8 months ago ) still works perfectly !	1
i've this camera since just before christmas 04 . i purchased www.bhphotovideo.com $350 . i should waited until after holidays , because price come down . it great finally small camera . i often forget i even it me ( which i guess bad ! ) . over all pictures good . focus sometimes soft . it doesn't take good night photos , but takes great daytime pics	1
this bag great active photographers . it doesnt matter how you store your equipment because straps velcro , come off moderate adjustments . me my lifestyle photography leads me many times up highplaces my photos , i tried many different types bags what i needed . mainly shoulder straps this one best so far it keeps contents bag very well protected so far not affected snow/ice or mildew/rain i am very pleased would recommend this bag anyone who would want alot room everything they'll need more	1
i like bag . pleanty pockets pouches all my little small accessories . just wish it little better suited 2 cameras like i . but , everything fits ... comfortable haul around all day . nice pads straps secure it my back . well padded equipment . i'd highly recommend it anybody	1
i humped this thing around dc last week 7 hours , not worry mention . well balanced , i it full camera , 4 lenses , flash miscellany . i cut all extra straps off , just shoulder harness left . it looks good too . course , it great advertisement thieves so never let it out your grip .	1
i'll keep this short , i assume most tec stuff covered . i sold 350d get 400d(xti ) . 400d focuses better , better ergonomics , same size/weight , takes great photos . i tried nikon d80 , but it loses way too much detail iso 400 up . plus canon line lenses fits my needs better , cheaper , available . nikon costs $300 more ( canon discounted ) , nikon raw converter adds $150 . so true cost difference $400-450 . i'd buy canon over nikon same price due image quality , especially if you shoot jpeg . btw , if you afford canon lenses(the 25-105l 70-200l-any 4 ) amazing . one caveat , any dslr , these cameras not p/s best some post processing knowledge how camera meters/exposes , etc . i can't emphasize this enough	1
emphasis portability , canon digital rebel xti designed firs t-t ime dslr photographers travel enthusiasts . measuring 5.0 " 3.7 " 2.6 " weighing 1.1 lbs ., it large largest point shoot cameras one smallest dslr camera bodies market . its size source both popularity criticisms . if you large hands or heavier lens , it may feel too small . optional battery grip help , but some want something more substantial . visit store nearby find out yourself . package includes camera body lens cap , battery , charger , manual , catalogs , neck strap , usb composite video cables , cd-roms . you need lens compactflash memory card . there may some static energy packaging , so remove lens cap dust-free environment such bathroom prevent dust entering sensor . much promoted sensor cleaning system helps , but it best not get any first place . canon sells 4 versions xti : black or silver finish or without ef-s 18-55mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 lens . black or silver largely personal preference , but most lenses , most accessories , all but low-end dslr camera bodies black . kit lens , it affordable introduction dslr capable if used exclusively f/8 or f/11 apertures ( soft other apertures ) . other words , lens not ideal shooting under low light . if you don't get zoom lens now , start canon ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii . it famous top-notch performance very low price . due xti aps-c image sensor ( compositions multiplied 1.6 ) , this lens becomes 35mm-equivalent 80mm . if you budget good zoom lens , over 100 lenses , canon you covered . some canon popular zoom lenses include ef 28-135mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 usm , ef 17-40mm f/4l usm , ef-s 17-55mm f/ 2.8 usm , ef 24-105mm f/4l usm . if these too pricey , third party vendors such sigma tamron make canon-compatible lenses less . their focus not nice canon usm but they generally outperform canon lower-end lenses . tamron sp af 17-50mm f/ 2.8 di ii ld aspherical ( if ) sigma 18-50mm f/ 2.8 ex dc af 17-70mm f/ 2.8 - 4.5 dc macro popular among budget-minded photographers . 10.1 megapixels image sensor , xti benefit sharper lenses . although increasing resolution over same image sensor area increase noise , canon improved sensor technology maintain low noise floor high dynamic range . performance wise , there very little criticize . great example canon trademark smooth , high contrast , saturated , low noise . noise remains low even iso 800 . it said shooting raw equivalent getting extra exposure ( 1.0 ev ) it help you maintain usable details acceptable noise iso 1600 . low noise gives xti bit excuse missing in-body image stabilizer . according canon , lens more effective location image stabilizer , especially telephoto . that true but i think feature would've nice . consolation , xti mirror lockup reduces vibration caused mirror movement . my sole performance criticism metering mode . it includes only partial not spot metering mode ( very useful when shooting high contrast scenes such candlelit birthday cake ) . perhaps more problematic evaluative metering mode , which occasionally underexposes images 2/3 ev or so . some criticized xti " plasticky " build . except metal lens mount , exterior largely made high quality engineering plastic rubbery paint . if you drop it , it probably crack or break , but it sturdy well made . flipping power lever , it starts up almost immediately ready use . much promoted auto sensor cleaning kicks when powering up down . most dslrs , there virtually no shutter lag it focuses split second ( especially when using usm lens ) . continuous shooting mode fast memory card , it take 10 raws or 27 jpegs 3 frames per second . raw images 10 mb each , so get speed 2 gb or larger memory card , such sandisk ultra ii series . replacing both 1.8 " lcd info display 2.5 " high resolution lcd led backlighting . it displays current camera settings , photos memory , menu . thanks greater real estate more refined user interface , xti very intuitive pleasure use . minus 10% lower battery life , which merely adequate begin . xti 95% crop 0.8 optical viewfinder displays 9 auto focus points , shutter speed , aperture , more , but misses iso speed , white balance , metering mode . overall , xti viewfinder more than adequate but pales nikon d80 larger more comprehensive one . highlights software package imagebrowser ( mac os universal binary ) , zoombrowser ( windows ) , digital photo professional ( mac os universal binary windows ) . imagebrowser zoombrowser easy-to-weight lightweight applications managing jpeg raw . digital photo professional considerably more powerful lets you use xti dust delete data feature removing dust its sensor cleaning hardware couldn't remove	1
amazing quality affordable price ( still not cheap tho ) . this lens takes great quality photos my daytime/outdoor performer . although i don't think equal 1 f-stop when it comes low light situations but it sure very helpful these high f-stop numbers	1
my first lens i'm sold . while i spend lot time - lot , this isn't small purchase - deciding this 24-70/ 2.8 , i feel i made right decision . first , i took into account what i actually shot . not what i thought shooting or wanted shoot , but what i really spent my time shooting . then i backed up looking past six months ' worth photos . me , this right choice . big decision wasn't over image quality - rather it max aperture . 2.8 vs 4.0 . 4.0 won . i absolutely love ! even higher speeds , rocks . ( it also eats batteries like hummer guzzles gas)ok , so shooting it dream . incredibly fast focus . wonderful fit finish . i could gush all night . if you're spending lot time trying justify it , don't . if it won't break your bank , it well worth it . if you're trying decide which lens , try what i . it made all difference me . what downside ? i'm ordering 17-40 today . lens bug bitten . next 70-200/ 2.8 . there goes kids college fund . : -	1
everyone gives this lens rave so maybe i should approach this terrific lens shooting pov . shooting wide open f2at 135 gives your pictures distinct quality you would never get zooms , there isn't zoom this focal length this speed either . few primes come close but they're nowhere near sharp wide open . af fast very accurate lens great feel 20d/5d/10d body even wo battery grip cameras . close up magnification . 19x . 21 therabouts nice bonus this lens , letting you get closer wo too your face tight headshots . i always felt photographers usually sweet spot when shooting certain things like some portrait photographers like distance 85mm gives them when approaching subject , turns out i'm liking 135 focal length quite bit headshots 85 torso head shots . one thing i like this 135/f2 combo there enough dof get most main subject view focus but background still blurred out . it really great when you want subject focus nothing else , opposed 85 1.2 parts subject could melt into background resulting images little too ethreal some tastes . couldn't you just stop down 85 ? sure but relationship foreground background would still different 135 . 135 f2 give result that juuust right . backgrounds just little more compressed foreground but foreground sharp but background gone . almost like you lurred background photoshop . but you'll never get same results blurring photoshop , one thing highlights would get muddied blur treatment ps while highlights stay clean f2 . don't just use this thing portraits , use it way you would use 50mm try frame such , again focal lenth wide aperture give interesting result . i basically use it candids portraits during wedding . fantastic lens , very sharp , very handholdable , focal length terrific portraits bokeh very beautiful , equal sharpness 85 1.2 or any canon $5k lenses . this probably best lens you get price , only lens i've used better saturation contrast 35 1.4 . downside : not handholdable 50 , 35 1.4 or 85 1.2 during low light situations due it focal length	1
i believe this one best lens $1000 . forget zoom lenses even if they . this lens far better than 70-200l my opinion . it very sharp f2 even more sharp 2.5 . zoom lenses you set f/ 5.6 better result f/8 match this lens . it very well built but not excessive heavy , come hood bag , but unfortunately , canon decided remove hard cases all lenses . combined tamron 1.4 teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality par any zoom lenses 189mm focal length . yes i know i lost convenience 70-200 zoom lens . but i am really happy i decide change plan buying 70-200is 135/2l+ 1.4 . this not only saves me money but also let me get better pictures , especially wide open . better portrait lenses , like 200/ 1.8 300/ 2.8 , would cost several thousands dollars . trust me , once you play primes , you not like zoom anymore . i am also using 24-70l shoot my small kid . after using this lens , i don't like it anymore thinking change primes someday , only reason preventing me doing 1.6 crop factor digital camera . 35mm/ 1.4 become 56mm which really not good . order amazon free shipping even though it says not stock . they shipped mine 2 days this happened before even though item stated " stock soon " . pros : very sharp f2 super sharp start 2.5 . very fast lens f/2very good bokeh ( background blurring ) . overall extremely good picture quality good contrast/color . smaller size , less weight black color compare those white 70-200s . it lens : best build quality , fast/quiet ring usm af ftm . cons : no hard case . no inexpensive . effective focal length 216mm 10d/20d/rebel/300d which little difficult use portrait	1
i bought this keep dust iraq out my canon ef-s 17-85 lens . it fine job i've seen no noticeable change quality images i'm capturing my canon 20d	1
i searched researched lens purchase my canon rebel xti weeks because i knew i not want kit lens . i also not money spend 5 , 6 , or $700 dollar lens . end after reading countless reviews , ones implementing professional techniques ones using just opinion , this lens looked best value . money i really don't think you beat this lens . it focuses quickly , it really quiet while doing it , it sharp enough money . plus it full time manual focus , which really big plus lens this price range . only problem it little narrow side 1.6 crop factor rebel xti , but i would much rather deal than sub-par image . summary i would recommend this lens place kit lens anyone who doesn't money buy " " series lens . it really great value	1
i bought this lens replace kit lens rebel xt . i find this lens very good value , very good value . i also canon 28-135 3.5 ... find 28-105 lens very stong lens price . it might even just notch clearer then 28-135 but half price . it size nice light weight fits nice rebel since it smaller dslr . all all , great lens budet price but it dosn't act like it . fast focus , fair range , nice size , easy lug around . i would sugest this lens any one first my list someone who not wanting go crazy lenses extras their camera , just want simply get some nice pics without spending all their lunch money . also lens takes same size filters kit lens , so if you spent few dollers few filters kit lens your luck . i know i happy still use 3 filters i've already got .	1
i've my remote switch almost 3 months now . i love it . so far only feature i used remote switch it works flawlessly . if you want trip shutter distance without shaking 20d ( camera i use ) this what you need . i use it extension cord since i am generally 30 feet away camera . i am very pleased this purchase . no complaints this point	1
i somewhat surprised receive my tc80n3 only canon international warranty .... anyone else receive grey market version this remote control ? i ordered $1000s canon products amazon.com always received canon usa warranty card items .... not sure why this item didn't carry usa warranty . i sent several emails amazon.com regarding this matter . i'll update review when i receive answer satisfactory . please note : amazon shipping replacement remote ! i'll amend again once replacement received . control itself wonderful product but this price i expect canon usa warranty card . gar	1
i some dust spots my lenses , mirrors inside . i afraid use brush or cloth kits , since they could easily scratch . one my photography books suggested i use this exact air blower , so i thought i'd give it try . it simple tool , but it emits strong amount air i able clean everything off . even works well keyboards or other dusty spots	1
i owned giottos rocket air blaster 2 weeks now love it . i use it blowing dust everything : camera lenses , computer screens out computer keyboards . it made nice soft material allows it stored flat out way . additionally , it creates sufficient pressure force away most dust particles course requires no canned air , it works you pump it . i'll never forced air again	1
best feature this flash wireless e-ttl feature . two 550ex one work master one slave st-e2 both flashes off camera fired e-ttl . draw backs : price , no manual control slave mode greater light control , size ( this thing big ) . plus side weighs out negatives . it great flash	1
top line . works advertised . ttl , e-ttl . 4 double aa batteries . tilt , rotate head , soft lens built . control slave flash	1
this camera first digital me , only camera i ever enjoyed . macro setting gives amazing closeups bugs , flowers , etc . purchase charger some batteries , i've kept it going almost nothing . better get big memory card , too . silly settings like " color swap " " fireworks " fun play . my only complaint it slow recover shots , so you miss some action kids , etc . price , it can't beat . gramma	1
very quick delivery . product exactly advertised . very happy whole process product	1
i never take my uv filter off my lens unless i am going immediately put different filter . there basically two camps out there , those feel you should always use uv filter protect your lens dirt scratches those feel it waste time only degrades your image . well , i tried going without one awhile then dirt started build up front element my very expense lens . although you clean front element lens , i feel much , much safer wiping my comparatively cheap uv filter time time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage . i think nearly unquantifiable loss image quality you may suffer uv filter , it well worth extra piece mind it gives me	1
very small size ( fits my baggy jean pocket ) , fast startup , fast response when shooting picture . much easier carry around than my canon g3 . not well indoors when flash needed . lots red eye , much more than my canon g3	1
optics best i've ever seen . clarity great . abillity focus small objects only 2 " away allows great macro pictures . however auto focus much slower than most canon lenses , but i focus manually . this my favotite lens ever	1
i only wish i bought this lens earlier so i could using it longer . i am especially pleased short minimum focus distance - 3 inches . this allows you get very close small subject still fill frame subject . i no problems this lens i love it	1
i canon sd-550 . this battery works perfect it . i've noticed no difference charge time usage when compare original manufacterer one . except price lot lower	1
product great ! you should get it . usually , i'm skeptical abour getting generic brands , but this works perfectly	1
incredible piece equipment almost give away price . i no complaints this camera surpasses what i expected	1
there already tons reviews eos 300d ( digital rebel ) but i want share my experience camera , so i keep this short . i bought this camera 5 months ago i am love . i not new photography or slr , but new world digital slr . i previously used ancient minolta x-570 , " pro-sumer " 35mm film slr vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens . first foremost this camera takes excellent pictures , very high quality no distortion i seen . this camera particularly good beginner dslr because there so many options use learn . but until you ready take advantage all featues , you use this just like point shoot . battery life excellent so far : thought i would suggest getting extra backup long days taking photos . i also quite happy kit lens , which i wasn't sure i would like since it not versatile lens i using my minolta . but kit lens proved great learning tool : i able take some great shots , while also learning what kinds other , better lenses i would like add my setup . ** only issue i problem sandisk 2gb cf card . after 300 shots , camera froze stopped responding card . i able salvage most photos after fact , but don't risk it . if you're serious enough spend this kind money camera , spend little extra money sandisk ultra ii line high-speed cards .	1
i've owned one these cameras four years now , i very pleased it . it light , small easy carry . it takes beautiful pictures -- very sharp , good colors . pictures look good even when you blow them up so big you see individual pixels . it actually my second camera like this . first problem usb port side camera , i took it back store traded it new one . this camera also problem too , after two years , button back needed making settings stopped working properly . but still , considering cost camera quality pictures , i buying one . it worth it .	1
i tried several digit-cams say you cannot find better camera this price . pros : + great value , low price+ easy handling+ portability , light weight+ great fuji colours , good auto white balance+ fast shutter response , close film cameras+ control over exposure , flash pre-programmed white balance+ it uses aa , great battery life+ changig images playback mode doesn't take hours+ excellent prints photoscons : - images noisier than competition ( but they more expensive also)- images too much compressed , therefore less detail , no control over jpeg compression ( but this same most fuji models unfortunately)- no control over iso- low resolution lcd , too dark low-light- no optical zoom ( but this price it ok)- camera cheap feel it ( but again , this price it ok)- weak flash outdoor night shots , but enough smaller room shots- flash recharge time takes few seconds , camera freezes ( but this same most fuji models unfortunately)- it uses expensive xd-cards- sluggish zooming panning playback mode- no sound videoi highly recommend this camera beginners or those who doesn't want spend more digital camera . i've read many negative reviews due it bad photo indoors . okay , it not canon g3 . first i thought same , but then set controls manual , set exposure up highest value then shot picture . end result much better than full auto mode . so my advice indoors low-light set exposure manually , you'll glad you i promise . colours well balanced , prints come out great , no matter how noisy images , you won't notice photo paper . this model now out sale , but if you find second-hand one good price don't afraid buy it , it excellent buy	1
this lens great those indoor regular nothing fancy shots . i recently used mine indoors restaurant distance or close up range perfect .	1
this lens works really fast . it great lens . captures color real depth detail my canon 20d camera	1
i initially canon s1is ( just 3mp , 10x optical , cf card ) needed upgrade same i visiting disney , la . s3is ( 6 mp , sd card ) delivered gusto its image stabilization higher iso modes . i full video reasonably good snaps disney parade during evening darkness ( switch highest iso dedicated iso button ) : 1 . amazingly low jerkiness due image stabilization . here course better than s1is . 2 . snaps came allright even maximum zoom - if there slight blurs , you maybe use software like coral adjust . others said here , yes , tripod best , but who time or patience set it up . 3 . even many disney fireworks snaps came out ok night mode maximum iso setting - though course tripod would helped darkness here , sure :) 4 . best value price . nov 2006 , nice deal would getting this camera within 350$ amazon . two things here : 1 . i would not buying videocam i planned earlier , s3is vidoes suffice most situations - sending videos afv instance . 2 . last point , i would recommend waiting 3-4 months till 4gb sd cards come into 50$ range . but others mentioned before , please least 2gb card . look amazon or fry i 35-40$ deals 2+ gb cards	1
i bought one when it first came market back may . half year 5,000 pictures later , here some my comments : - it great digital camera its own class . " class " i mean one should not compare it dslr because s3 not one . so not expect it overcome " shutter lag " easily , although among other dc ( digital camera ) i used , shutter lag s3 greatly improved -- degree i feel comfortable taking photos very fast pace , e.g. , catching flying birds . ( however , only good dslr completely eliminate shutter lag s3 not dslr . ) one also should not compare s3 " small " point-'n-shoot dcs . s3 not small those -- it won't easily slide into your pocket , unless your pocket relatively big loose ( like mine ) . but slightly larger body brings great features none small dc offer . - big optical zoom ( 12x ) . 12x great combined canon imagine stabilization , s3 turns into powerful large zoom camera superb imagine quality . my recent trips included shooting ( cameras case you wonder ) wild wolf yellowstone national park . this little s3 came out only one capture animals great distance , other " big guns " professionals carry . feature eliminates hand shake great effect i could shoot 12x low light still get quality photos . i also highly recommend " tc-dc58b tele converter lens " s3 ( or s2 ) which gives you 1.5 zoom effectively make s3 18x zoom ( equivalent 600mm lens ) . check how much those big telephoto lens cost ( close 10k ) ... - excellent video shooting . again feaure one almost never finds any other dc or dslr . s3 takes dvd quality video stereo sound , not just video clips most dc . this little ( almost ) pocket-size camera now forces our digital videocam into early retirement . - many other great features . however those more or less standard one always try argue some other dc may similar or better features . i won't comment those . summary , s3 great small-size dc . its superb lens offers big 12x zoom , two technology canon pride . it also offers dvd video shoot stereo sound -- this feature alone save you digital vidoecam . one suggestion -- get big sd card if you want shoot video too . i 4g sd card i think 2g must . also battery life excellent . it uses 4 aa-battery , which seems lot odd beginning . but it comes handy because long you get aa battery you never worry power . typical dslr , if battery out you day unless you find power outlet recharge ( your charger you ) . i one small complain . menu button back camera location where my palm presses body . sometimes i raise s3 i see menu viewfinder because my palm pressed it strong enough trigger it . press needed i lost several shots because this . i other dslr quality lens . but i always take s3 me any trip	1
my 2 year old really active my point shoot camera cannot keep up him . i also don't like washout look when i uses flash . so i researched which slr best meet my needs , mainly catching fast action , candid moments low light photos without flash . canon 30d comes up top list . it best high iso performance its class ( better than nikon sony ) . when i combine 30d fast zoom lens ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 , result amazing . i stop any action daylight , capture every candid expression my 2 yr old fast burst mode , take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod . portraits also excellent sharp image beautifully blurred background ( bokeh ) . even dimly-lit decors disneyland haunted mansion came out superb when we went there halloween party night , without flash or tripod . this really important factor me buy this camera , taking pictures tripod not option when your subject active 2 yr old . but you need good lens make this work well . if you use cheap kit lens , then it probably not matter which camera you pick . remember these 3 all very good cameras small differences image quality you see reviews apparent only when they use best prime lens ( not kit lens)and crop pictures magnify details . sony very good choice if you budget don't need low light performance ( use flash save money ) . nikon more custom function than canon , it really good canon . they both their strength weakness . canon just happens slightly better high iso performance suits my need better than nikon . fair , i should mention nikon d200 tops most reviews camera year , beating canon 30d overall . but d200 bit too advanced amateur like me , better suits someone more serious photography . d80 like " mini " d200 , but slower . so it really boils down what you really need how much you want spend . shooting low light without flash need good high iso performance , good fast lens ( wide aperture , usually expensive ) , image stabilization . if that what you want , canon 30d ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 not disappoint you	1
this camera incredible . i ordered it my husbands birthday he just begining figure it all out . there so many great features . one best how quickly you take digital pictures . our other digital cameras lag time shots , but not this one . pictures crisp it easy even novice like me use . i highly recommend this camera if you want take digital photography next level . it one best	1
though i am not qualified write quality filters , they seem doing job pretty well . finish good they fit well 58 mm canon lense my rebel xt . lense cap goes right over it so it doubly protected . small pouch hold three filters also big help keep them safe easily accessable	1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shaped offers limited protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . shallow petal shaped , this type protection also limited . even if protection limited , replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing lens easier replace . this hood manufactured canon 28-135mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 ef normally not included lens when sold new . amazon often suggests purchasing one your lens , worth considering . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . this lens itself isn't unusually wide so extra inch may not problem . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality reduces lens flare problems offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store lens	1
this camera lot modes you use . it very good resolution optical zoom . 12x optical zoom you click awesome pictures , specially live performances sightseeing trips . 5 mp resolution more than enough , otherwise pics become just too big fit one screenshot . you also panoramic pictures it . big advantage windows recognized this camera soon i connected it using usb cable comes it , transferring pics pc becomes very simple . only two complaints - flash recycling time should lesser , sd card comes it only 16 mb , which hardly enough 7-8 pics . you buy 512 mb or 1 gb sd card separately . also , batteries come it not rechargeable , so you buy charger batteries well , which not so expensive . but these drawbacks there s3is also . overall , this camera gives very clear pictures worth buying if you happen get it decent price .	1
i got this canon camera back may my birthday my husband . once i got it home it very easy learn use . i actually not even used all features yet ... because there so many . this my 3rd digital camera 1st canon ... i say i stick canon now ... i use always like kodak but canon much better . i print off pictures using my kodak printer everything still looks great ! i love canon so much i just bought canon camcorder ... i hope it just nice their digital cameras . i highly recommend this camera families ... i used it live action after you get hang image stabilizer everything turns out well ..... i feel i use this camera while when it time upgrade camera i stick w/ canon ..	1
i started looking earlier version this flash when i saw upgrades 430ex i didn't hesitate order it . it what i've needed take my photos higher level . i shoot two magazines now instead taking my studio light into every shoot , i still carry it me , i use this flash instead it makes world difference	1
this very nice flash unit integrates well powershot pro1 camera . i appreciate zooming strobe tube match lens focal length well ability bounce flash off ceiling softer effects . i should purchased this flash when i first got pro1 camera	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
this good zoo lens . it not heavy or noticeable something like 100-400 lens . also , 3 stop smaller size weight this makes great backup lens 100-400 trips or when i just don't feel like carrying around 3+ pound lens all day . so if you don't want deal cost or size series lens this one next best options	1
i am lifelong photographer i purchased this camera january . i taken it several major trips . it wonderful performer . i many 11x14 enlargements i received terrific feedback . quality this camera cannon optics not disappoint . price right now replacement out .	1
i am just hobbyist . this big purchase big step me get into this level camera . i still haven't mastered using it yet , i've it few months . it wonderful job taking pictures . if you right lenses , it take some most beautiful pictures you've ever seen . again , i'm just hobbyist/enthusiast . i use it take pictures work , too . i highly recommend getting couple very good lenses go it . don't go cheap lenses canon , tamron , sigma , etc . make this camera . yourself favor get nice zoom - spend some bucks . you'll happy you . camera itself pretty easy use if you leave it auto , but that like buying race car never shifting out first gear . auto settings great , they wonderful job , but you so much more if you learn use camera manual , av , tv , or mode . it allows you so much more creativity you'll amazed difference . 30d came out right before i bought 20d , i would probably buy it price now , but i'm very happy my 20d	1
my kids competitive tae kwon . i now used camera my wife gave me one year ago several tournaments . it able stop action take great shots even low lighting . now , we tried it when we went skiing it also worked great glare conditions snow . i bought monopod worked real well stabalize i use software called photofinale crop share photos . one year into usage i am still looking forward each chance i get play this " toy " . next options : battery grip , flash diffuser , extra remote flash ..	1
i concerned when i ordered this filter previous problems reported here . but , i hurry needed two these vacation . there absolutely no problem product . both filters sealed perfect condition . could packed little better shipping box , but arrived good condition . no problems photos taken this product	1
i never take my uv filter off my lens unless i am going immediately put different filter . there basically two camps out there , those feel you should always use uv filter protect your lens dirt scratches those feel it waste time only degrades your image . well , i tried going without one awhile then dirt started build up front element my very expense lens . although you clean front element lens , i feel much , much safer wiping my comparatively cheap uv filter time time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage . i think nearly unquantifiable loss image quality you may suffer uv filter , it well worth extra piece mind it gives me	1
this it . i upgraded sigma ex 2.8 80-200 . i should spent money nikon first time . sigma very nice lens less , good alternative , but if you want it all , go nikon . leave your tripod home when you get this glass . i don't know how this compares , but i'm shooting hand held 1/30s shutter full zoom ( 35mm equivalent 300mm ) . vr phenomenal , wide aperature delivers beautiful blur , overall fit construction flawless . tack sharp images too	1
i buy this uv filter protect my kit lens(18-55mm ) , so far so good . i am using canon rebel xd . if you just want get cheap uv protect your lens , buy this one	1
after overpaying fancy camera store , i happy purchase identical filter amazon fraction price . these filters give you piece mind , protection sand , fingerprints baby spittle	1
i recently purchased this camera it very easy use takes nice pictures . i bought case put it so i could keep screen getting scratched . go out find generic camera bag fit it . they so much cheaper than canon camera bags . only thing this camera i would like change i wish it battery life indicator .	1
this tripod total shock ! i amazed quality , stability portability . heavy duty denier carrying case great bonus . level quick release also welcome surprise . this best $9.00 i ever spent photography accessories .	1
previous review not completely correct . problem not product but description what amazon.com put up canon cpm-e3 battery magazine . it battery magazine canon compact battery pack cp-e3 not camera battery grip . i think product itself great thing , it lets you switch whole magazine 8 preloaded batteries instead replacing batteries canon compact battery pack cp-e3 . previous reviewer should not judge product incorrect infromation given retailer	1
canon 1ds mark ii not list $ 11,999 . body only it lists around $ 7,500	1
i purchased this camera online one month ago amazon here [ ... ] i taken pictures alaska florida washington i love how mark ii captures images imho more clearly than any film slr could ever take . best camera i every use	1
this cleaning pen just advertised . i used it daily basis since i got it , it never failed great job . i use this visibledust huricane blower , combo unbeatable . great value price	1
i bought this pen my boyfriend his new canon digital rebel slr , but you could use it almost anything lens . it got small brush one end swipe away big stuff , round felt tip other cleaning smudges . he finds it very useful it fits right hiw camera bag	1
i got this cord mainly macro work so i could use long macro lenses my flash without deal lens shadow picture . it also very nice able control direction lighting placing flash above , below , or beside subject . red eye also almost entirely reduced moving flash further away camera body , so this cord helpful portrait work . it could little longer , but longer it gets more difficult it would pack it small spaces , so all-in-all i think they pretty good job . it works fine , if you want all your flash functionally , but don't want it hotshoe , this good choice	1
only problem i live holland things sent my daughter us then forwarded since you don't ship overseas . any hope may change future	1
i needed replace lost s4oo we year . looked sd series thought them too small comfort . there such thing too thin handle comfortably . s500 , like s400 , just right size . big area back thumb so you even one-hand hold it . try any sd . pictures excellent hand-held . not nikon n70 film slr good , but plenty good enough any snapshot purpose . bought one last new s500 available newegg abd very , very happy it	1
this flash unbelievable , most time i use built-in filter because it so powerful , great value money . just takes some practice getting it adjusted correctly i said before it really throws light out there . highly recommended	1
finally able put some money aside get new flash my d50 . i looked less expensive sigma flashes , but end i decided go nikon . i figured i spend money camera , i'm going get better flash . used it other day took some great portraits my daughter . flash worked like charm . it better than camera pop-up flash . pop-up flash comes handy if you can't or forget bring main flash , but it really nice extra power sb-600 . if you think your going lot indoor photography ( birthdays , holidays , etc .. ) this great flash . if you children , best bet portrait photos ,,, nikon d50 , nikkor 50mm 1.8 sb-600 flash . great combination very good price . we haven't take kids their pictures taken studio . this set-up , you take great portraits your kids their own environment more convenient time you kids decide . no traveling nice cloths worry	1
i waiting 3 years any manufacturer market camera similar specification canon eos1 . exploration health , safety environment advisor , work takes me middle desert or oceans . wait 35mm film quality , speed picture taking ( 5 frames per second barely enough capture dolphins - hence 8 + fps eos 1 desired ) . there parallel wait image stabilised 28-300 zoom lens . let cut story short . if i want camera bring holiday , it would not this one - battery charger too heavy bulky ; instead i would choose eos20d without hesitation . but hundreds failed 35mm film frames i decided not wait any longer but buy eos1d mark ii because 1ds mark ii not fast enough 4 frames second . 35mm cameras , after few seconds shooting , i would run back inside cabin ( ship ) change film . if there large enough memory card eos1dii , there no need . this camera built seals against environment ( so 28-300mm lens ) . instead scared running out film , now it easy keep shutter button pressed while panning ( hoping ) dolphins their jumps into air . 28-300mm lens attached , there no need change lenses either . dolphins riding bow wave ship could captured 28mm while those further away could caught 300mm setting . it disappointment battery not lion but older nimh . but any photo gear requiring battery it wise spare , whatever substance . i just wish canon package small travel size charger instead standard one which very bulky . it connections two batteries ( yet it could only charge one following other ) but most people would happy using one battery while other one charged . you just try convince some airport officials let you plane above kit , binoculars , laptop , mobile phone , gps ....... ext . hard disk .... hand luggage . work , i am committed therefore bear weight troubles hauling hardware . but holidays , i would choose eos20d built-in flash because who would want lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun possibly tripod ? camera gets 4.5 stars but battery charger lets it down . why just 4.5 stars ? one beauties i thought digital slr not anything processing , just transfer images computer . wrong . . jpg straight out camera not sharp enough . post processing required . why ? why necessary when canon s60 ( which i use different assignments ( underwater housing )) doesn't need ? defeats point . jpg file 5.5 meg when 1.5 meg s60 looks sharper straight out camera ? still , there raw if standard output not suficient . incidentally , eos1dsii also produces 5.5 meg . jpg those also require post processing . those us who not interested working longer than necessary ( me ) 16.7 million pixels would seem bit wasted . i am still waiting camera which produces sharp . jpg files in-camera without post process , shoot 8+ fps sensor size equivalent 35mm film . meantime i shall learn shoot raw files post process . also incidentally , sensor size eos20d smaller , which means although itself lighter than eos1d series camera , carry around extrawide lens not my idea fun holiday . magnification ratio eos1dii 1.3 whereas eos20d 1.6 . this means i could still travel reasonably light ( compromise ) 1dii 28-135mm lens attached . sure it possible use stitching but more time spent computer time precious . any regrets ? none what-so-ever . it state technology moment . benefit using digital , it doesn't matter if you shooting iso 100 all day . come night if you want shoot rig moon backdrop , just change iso 1600 without bother " pushing2 film developing . it beauty when lens attached . you'd need when there machinery vibrations ship moving swell ! good job canon . now you need shoe horn more capable cpu ( process images in-camera ) , fit 1dsii sensor into this one or this motordrive into 1dsii you may persuade me part more cash .	1
i cannot say enough this camera ! moment you pick up box , you know you quality . construction materials used top notched . contents box found elsewhere , so i won't bother details . charging battery full takes 2hrs . if you memory battery repeated charges without complete depletion , you recondition battery included charger . it just takes 8hrs . while many lament fact no li-ion battery included , canon seems anticipated needs professionals field . one also option plugged into ac outlet not dependent batteries . reading manual takes bit time . camera endless customizable functions which overwhelming times . not it should deter you , but one rarely need all those functions anyway . using camera not seem too difficult . many functions need use two buttons , which may take some getting used . navigating through menu confusing initally , but improved time goes . autofocus speed responsive sharp . shooting high iso ( #62 ; 1000 ) minimal noise . looking some my pictures taken 1 fluorescent light room iso 1600 , appeared if flash used . photos my black lab incredible considering ambient light high iso . camera always ready go . if you manipulating within depths menu heirarchy , want suddenly take shot , just press shutter button , compose , focus , shoot . its quick responsive . incredible ...! some may wondering sizes pictures . jpeg 4 sizes range 1 - 2.8 mb ; raw files 8.4 mb . one take average 800 - 1200 shots full battery charge -- assuming one capacity hold it . prints my i9900 outstanding . cost pretty penny then some . also consider amazon authorized canon reseller . many rebates require you purchase authorized reseller eligible rebates . also , some internet deals camera not authorized resellers . overall , very impressive camera . cost many may prohibitive many . eos 20d may more cost effective alternative , but i not regret my decision one bit	1
this what i discovered when i've used my brand new 1d markiinwell , i say i am truly impressed this camera . friend mine got his month ago , so i played it little bit , but since i got mine thursday , i really gotten explore many features performance differences beween this camera 20d i upgraded . used few original 1d cameras , 1d mark ii , 20d battery grip 5d , size weight this camera really doesnt bother me ( i heard so many people complain size weight before ... ) i actually really like feel 1d mark ii . there only slight difference original 1d mark ii feel , but if you hold them side side you notice it . autofocus absolutely stunning . used 20d year half , i forgotten how nice it those 45 highly sensitive autofocus points ! soon you pick up this camera hold shutter button half way down , you realize why this #1 choice many best photojournalists . body construction highest quality i ever seen camera , but course very similar , if not identical other 1d series cameras . compared 20d 5d though , this thing just feels solid . stunning feature , course , speed which 1d mark ii capture images ... 8.5 frames per second ! just 1d 1d mark ii past few years , this camera holds its own all other cameras its class , 22 frame raw bursts 8.5 frames per second . i hardly ever shoot jpeg , but i test it found 48 frame buffer quite impressive . packing two 2 gig sandisk ultra ii cards ( cf sd ) i capacity 450 total shots . screen , course , fantastic , blows any nikon camera menu image review quality out water . 1.3 crop factor certainly improvement over 20d 1.6 , bigger sensor definitely yields better image quality low light due lower signal-to-noise ratio . overall , color reproduction , metering , exposure sharpness all much better than 20d . since i love wildlife photography i able get 75% more caption information than i ever my pervious camerasthe camera performs great studio , images beautiful , would expected . i yet make any photographic prints this camera , but i'm sure they look stunning .	1
canon three digital cameras $ 2,500 + . 1ds mark ii , 1d mark iin relatively new 5d . i chose canon over nikon ( which i've shot most my photographic life ) because canon more impressive suite lenses . here decision process i went through . most products , it comes down how you'll use it . all them tradeoffs . 1 . megapixels . more pixels - few caveats - translates into image enlarged ( cropped more tightly)with less deterioration . 1ds market leader 16.7 mp , 5d comes 12.7 mp 1d 8.2 mp . if you're commercial art or magazine photographer 1ds probably makes sense . if you're wedding photographer , 5d probably sweet spot . practice , however , difference pixels these cameras not make appreciable difference most people . 8.2 mp , you make 11x17 print 200 pixels/inch without any enlargement beyond camera native resolution . up size , you certainly won't see much difference prints three cameras . said , higher megapixels other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude . 2 . full frame . 1ds 5d full frame - means sensor camera capture view scene you're accustomed seeing your 35 mm film camera . 1d most digital cameras what called field view crop factor ( fovcf ) . 1d , it 1.3 . what means both viewfinder image sensor don't capture everying lens " seeing " - it crops view little tighter . result : your lenses effectively 1.3 longer . 70 mm lens becomes 91 mm lens so . because camera effectively " cropping " edges image lens produces , it also tends eliminate softness or vignetting appears edges some lenses . whatever camera you use , what you see viewfinder still what you get , it doesn't affect pixel resolution image . my 300 mm lens 1.4 extender 1.3 fovcf effectively 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory . ( if you're switching film digital , some your lenses may may no longer fit your needs focvf . your 35 mm lens no longer really wide angle 45 mm . ) 3 . durability . this most important me , though it may not someone who doesn't shoot extreme conditions or expects replace their camera two years . both 1ds 1d sport complete metal bodies , sealed against weather shutter last least 200,000 cycles . 5d - very solid camera - designed 100 , 000 , not weather sealed more plastic components . 4 . weight/size . what solid , metal body giveth durability it taketh away weight . those who prefer camera heft , these it . many people , this big drawback . 1ds 1d 43 oz ., or almost three pounds just body , without big battery . add battery you're 54 oz . 5d just 29 oz . 31 oz . battery . 1ds 1d , built-in vertical grips , also more than 2 inches taller . if you're looking something less obtrusive easier carry around , 5d it . 5 . speed . there reason 1d camera choice photojournalists , sports many bird photographers . it shoots smooth 8.5 frames per second , compared 4 fps 1ds 3 fps 5d . most day-to-day uses , 3 fps more than adequate . using both , i'd say 1d autofocuses bit faster , too . 1d 45 autofocus points , compared nine 5d . 6 . price . give or take hundred here or there , 1ds $ 7,200 ; 1d $ 3,900 ; 5d $ 3,000 . price determine whether you get 1ds or not . if you afford it , go it . otherwise , other features - or possiblity buying more lenses instead more camera - make your decision . what i decide ? first , i looked how i'd use camera : photojournalism , travel wildlife photography . higher fps not important me durability autofocus speed , so either 1d or 1ds would . end , i decided i'd rather spend money lenses would not obsolete next new improved camera . ( i bought 300 f/ 2.8 close difference price . ) so , i went 1d mark iin . if my camera generating some good cash flow or my wife didn't need new car , i'd probably gone 1ds . i'm very happing decision camera . most people most uses - general portrait , landscape travel photography - 5d probably way go . ( or perhaps next greatest camera canon announce later this year .	1
since this my first digital camera , i really can't compair it others out there . however , it everything i need it more features than i make use ! i've never problem it	1
yep , it extends eyepiece out little bit ... which helps those us noses not smudge lcd display ... but it also distorts view annoying way . i use mine occasion ... but not all time	1
my take this lens it " " quality optic fine , non " " package . there nothing else market compete it ( nothing all ) , it produces supurb images . it isn't f/ 2.8 lens , but it close enough most uses . competition tamron full stop slower , not sharp , awful dim light compared canon 10-22 lens ( sorry , tamron fans , but tamron lens isn't even playing same ballpark ) . i use this lens 30d body , i always keep it hand if i'm doing any indoor , or tight group photography . it perfect solution perennial problem not enough room capture all kids birthday party one shot because your back up against wall . this lens just get your toes into picture widest setting , yet delivers tack sharp , colorful , contrasty images . auto focus spot , silent , fast . it must lens active amateur , or any pro using 1.6 crop factor camera . you simply can't beat this lens anything available market today . beng said , not try convince yourself this make good " walkaround " lens . it isn't . even max length , it far too short live your camera standard lens . you need this lens , even if you don't know it yet , but it should not your first lens , it only used 15 20 percent time . those times , it performance simply cannot equaled any other zoom lens 1.6 crop factor camera . you amazed quality this lens . it rivals performance modern prime lenses , presents bright viewfinder image , delivers goods tight situations . this not casual assessment , nor canon " feel good " moment my part . i developed my first bw contact prints 1964 , my own darkroom age 9 ( my parents concerned :)) , avid photographer ever since . small , medium , large format cameras lenses passed through my hands over years , canon become my favorite small format brand . still , canon builds some trash lenses should avoided . 10-22 usm not one them :) . before you go out buy this lens , you should already own ef-s 17-55mm f/ 2.8 lens . king 1.6 crop factor standard lenses , includes awesome canon feature . it end up mounted your camera 80% time , keep you smiling after every shoot . get lens first . then , get 10-22mm lens . then , let your imagination run wild , plan serious telephoto lenses future . trust me or not , two lenses mentioned above provide you photographic tools astound you . get them your kit soon you afford them . little warning either lens .... some here argue point , but either lens , get good quality uv filter multi-coated both sides , built extra thin avoid vignetting wide lens settings . good filter cost little less than one hundred dollars , cost up one hundred forty dollars . minimum brand would hoya pro 1 multi coated filters , ante goes up there . everything else garbage , including canon " sharp cut " filter costs less than fifty bucks . no kidding , no conjecture . if you use cheap filters , you never see what your lens really . ever . no doubt many respond claims their twenty dollar filter works just fine , but they simply don't know any better , never used their expensive equipment it full potential . it akin chevy owner passing judgement mercedes benz . chevy might feel real good , but until you own mercedes , you just no clue . bottom line .... make sure quality your filters exceed quality your lenses . yes , hundred bucks pop 77mm filter , it hurts , but you never regret it . also , amazon not stock lens hoods all non canon lenses . price stupid high those hoods , but they make night day difference picture quality . whenever you order non canon lens , find web seller who hood stock , get it right now . again , you never regret owning i t.t hat it my review/rant . buy this lens . buy 17-55 f/2 , 8 first . buy lens hoods both . toss any " kit " lenses came camera trash bin ( where they belong ) , very happy .	1
many great things already said this lens , i support them ! my copy delivers outstanding sharpness ( nearly par my 24-70l ) even * wide open * ( rare wide angle all but finest german manufacturers ) , great color , very little distortion ( many objective tests revealed it probably " best breed " ultra wide angle ) , impressive contrast . surprisingly , build quality not bad : tight fitting mount , damped rings , no jiggles or rattles . if i forced offer ( slight ) negative , it would bokeh lens somewhat " marbly " ... however , when shooting subject oof area differential high enough make bokeh component frame , then subject likely going demand far more attention than bokeh ! ;) fine lens , canon : definitely worth premium over sigma tokina rivals ( both which i sampled before purchasing this optic )	1
i've my d70s year now , haven't regretted it second . controls laid out logically , everything hand . dual control wheels make adjustments fast accurate . i personally love optional grid overlay , i no excuses horizons aren't horizontal . wireless flash system great , though you buy sb-600 or sb-800 get full benefit . this camera bigger heavier than d50 d80 , which my opinion positive thing .	1
it learning curve , that sure , but wow ! this camera worht every penny , far more stable then comparable canon rebel , product comes better lenses . quality glass matter	1
this excellent add-on close-up lens , not confused relatively inexpensive 1-2-4 sets sold aftermarket accessories . this double-element achromatic ( color-corrected ) lens made canon recommended lenses range 50-135mm focal length . it very sharp clear no color fringing . " 250 " indicates maximum distance subject 250mm main lens focussed infinity . actual lens power 4.0 diopters (+4 ) . it 58mm outer thread so you add clear filter ( uv or skylight ) protect lens surface . i am using it canon a620 required adapter , it produces outstanding pictures excellent detail sharpness .	1
i got this lens go wider 20d . i wanted go wider so i got 5d . started shooting events this lens i learned 580ex couldn't give me enough light dark . used lens during day . terrible problems lensflare . hood showed up edges pictures ( wide ) . went back 24-70l my primary lens . when this lens works circumstances right , results stunning . i'm trying use two flashes get power use it night , again terrible flare problems . whenever it matters i go back 24-70l . i just don't all these problems i t.t he problems 16-35 lens appear wide end . 35 lens operates well but that not what i bought lens . i love lens but it lens gives me most frustration worry . wish it cost less but what you	1
we dedicated thumb drive use digital photo frame we download our digital pictures computer . then we simply plug thumb drive into usb port digital photo frame follow menu instructions select usb port thumb drive pushing couple buttons digital photo frame . slide show pictures we view approximately ten feet away very good resolution . it great family gatherings received many positive comments our guests .	1
picture quality better than i expected . you still can't see picture sides , but straight it good . interface load my pictures very simple . i would like few more options available , but simplicity purposes , it works great	1
i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	1
i'm really impressed , i bought sd-110 year ago quick small digital trips . i never planning take it diving . housing really impressive , i've 4 dives month i waterproof case ( wp-dc10 ) it works great . i so excited try it out i went water full memory card . i got down 35ft took my first picture " memory card full " . it easy navigate all buttons i able delete while following my buddy . taking pictures fast moving fish doesn't work out range flash 1-3ft . my deepest dive so far 109ft off monterey coast , i worked if it 10ft water	1
recently picked up hobby digital photography i not aware nuances importance some accessories . back " day " when shooting 35mm film i could barely afford cost processing - let alone what i thought fancy accessories . well - some reading trip alaska my canon digital rebel xt - i learned , appreciate , importance lens hood . i bought rubber lens hood ( not lens specific ) local camera store totally unacceptable - then bought lens hood my canon lens amazon . it works great - no flare - no vignetting - it makes lens look pretty cool too ! i would suggest hood all your lenses never shooting without - obvious - it saves front lens bumping damage which important longer lenses or tight quarters like shooting photo excursion boat full other people all jockeying shot ! amazon service prices - usual - fantastic although i hate wait things - i am usually happy i when i order here . happy snapping !!	1
when hood reversed lens , it blocks zoom ring tremendously when 17mm . it not end world , but you're probably better off storing this bag , not lens itself when not use	1
i've used canon eos 10d 5 months now i'm absolutely thrilled it . eos cameras extremely comfortable hold handle . auto mode , camera produces correctly exposed , sharp photos . unlike my canon powershot , camera takes picture very little delay after depressing shutter button . creative zones , you set aperture priority take , example , selective focus shots , or use shutter speed priority set slow shutter speed take some good blurring shots . auto focus quick accurate , though how much camera how much lens i not know . i never use manual focus mode . pop-up flash works great lighting subject shadows or back lit . i now find it bit frustrating use my film camera ; i'm addicted viewing my shots spot . i canon eos a2 film camera i purchased 1995 . since i'm familiar eos system canon system lenses , i chose 10d over similarly priced nikon prosumer digital camera . i like my canon cameras so well i bought canon digital elf my sister canon powershot a80 my mother . both reportedly excellent cameras . 10d , i've used canon 50mm/compact macro , tamron 28-200mm canon 15mm fisheye lens . because difference way film camera this digital camera operate , you multiply focal length lens 1.6 figure effective focal length when used digital camera . so , example , 15mm fisheye lens effectively 24mm lens 1 0d.i bought 1 gig imb microdrive storage card allows me take 400 high res jpg or 160 raw format files . if you shoot auto mode , camera only capture jpg format . if you shoot manual mode , you select jpg or raw format . if shooting raw format , ensure you software program , such photoshop cs , open raw files . know not all developing printing shops accept raw format . but many image libraries only accept raw files ( or high resolution tif scanned slide ) . raw format files , i've found many my shots require bit exposure adjustment , but this simply matter moving slider bar photoshop cs . when you first open raw file , you get adjustment window allowing you play exposure , tint , saturation , white balance more . you even simulate warmup filters such . very cool stuff ! i bought extra battery take trips . one battery typically lasts me 2 days shooting , long i don't much reviewing my shots through camera monitor . unless you need quality 1ds immediately i would recommend getting 10d because technology moving so fast quality 1ds available current price 10d near future	1
i this camera 4 yrs now - i take it all my business travels . whenever i get chance go out weekends , i take this camera my sony camcorder my backpack , roam streets new city shoot pictures . pictures i shoot this camera just awesome - no matter whatever experiment i it . most useful features : 1 . aperture control depth field preview - lets focus foreground blur background2 . shutter speed control upto infinity - lets you control amount time which shutter kept open3 . it pretty rugged , dont try dropping it :) i used it shoot pics ' maid mist ' niagara falls i almost thought i going lose it . but it worked liked charmnegatives - bulky , but you get used it , it always gets attention - cost developing film - what i these days just get photos cd , then develop only those photographs good . why this camera better than digital camera ? - if you spending $200 digital camera , i feel slr way far too ahead any digital camera price range - if you spending $1000 digital camera , digital slrs very mature today - worth buying . ideally , i would buy this slr , take this whenever i really want take good photographs , then i would also want $100 kodak digital camera casual shots . this would mean ideal combination . if you buying this slr , you also consider buying film/photo scanners ( available less than $150 now ) - which lets you scan negatives/positives without even going cheap cd print . reviews what i read amazon , these scanners must amazing	1
item exactly described . works perfectly helped make some great shots yosemite	1
worked well while i took pictures fireworks over lake tahoe 4th july . only wish camera accessories canon logo weren't so expensive .	1
i purchased this canon remote switch 4 months ago i use it almost constantly . this one most useful camera accessories i purchased . every photographer should one his/her toolbox . remote switch essential if you photos low light or macro photography . slightest movement your camera when you press shutter release could cause your photo ruined . this switch eliminates " camera shake . " before i purchased this switch , i use self-timer feature my camera time delay very inconvenien t.t here few reviews saying canon remote switch over-priced cheaply made . i don't think true all ! i would definitely buy this accessory again .	1
anyone who wants make their photos different , this lens ! 180 degree capacity fabulous auto focus capability , this lens takes ordinary photo turns it into something extraoridinary . i shoot magazines many photos selected publication taken lens . it expensive toy , but worth money when you see results . i highly recommend it	1
i feel these filters not required if you digital camera coze you you what ever you like computer graphics programs only uv protector important	1
first , let me cover most important point : it work ? yes . praise most users express this item well merited . i purchased this because , like everyone else , normal batteries just not last . ten or fifteen photos , especially if you used flash , they'd ready change ; even so-called " heavy duty " or those marketed " digital camera " didn't make difference . well , both those terms should reserved these power cells ; they really less like battery more like power pack . my first charge up , which took only 3 hours 6 minutes - i timed it - i wanted actually test how many photos one could get . my smaller camera , 3mp fujifilm finepix s3100 , i got 52 photos , some flash , most without . not random snaps see how many it could record , but actually taking time frame them , select composition , etc . camera stayed entire time using full lcd rather than viewfinder , took all photos highest-resolution setting , transferred auto , manual , situational modes , charged full flash 8 times , went into preview mode . three hours , 47 minutes later , i got " low battery " warning - not depleted - low . i stopped then , sure i not overpaid . ** note : these power cells likely last much longer than 3h47m . lower resolution may result more photos . these numbers simply represent unscientific but strenuous personal test see what product would o.o ther notes product : - all parts except door made hard , impact resistant plastic . - fold away plug back makes charger easier store . - red green leds very bright , no mistake charge full mode . - two " channels " , . seems charge sets batteries best ; this may issue reviewer who reported issues using one battery time . - black ( body back ) , silver ( body front ) blue ( door ) looks nice . i one complaint , though perhaps it only one founded pure puzzlement . door flips open ... right . when holding unit your hand , monster logo top led bottom , door flips open right . my guess this decision made so door didn't close your hand when loading , because most people tilt it their left hand so it facing away them 45 degrees ; i know i . my final review : 5 out 5	1
2 years heavy use - not even one little bitty problem . they've traveled well under harsh conditions , they still function wonderfully . there you go	1
fits my canon sd550 perfectly no complains abt . quality product pretty good . when used belt clip , its easy open easy put camera back . camera seems very secured when used belt clip .	1
i cannon sd600 i've pleased my carrying case , it takes beating but protects my camera nicely . highly recommend both camera this case	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
i using my sony cybershot dscn1 8.1 mp month now . it so easy use . , i love how you easily delete picture via touch screen . only issue i it , i can't use memory pro stick my sony photo printer ( 5 year old model ) , because stick not compatible . ps : don't forget buy memory stick pro if you purchase this camera . you're gonna need it .	1
d70s minor update original d70 introduced 2004 , few new features slightly larger lcd . it still great camera , but expect it replaced new d80 , which 40 percent more pixels , 2.5 -inch lcd , additional useful features old price d70s . so , you probably save little money still purchase sophisticated digital slr if you wait until prices d70s stabilize new , lower level . , say , $600 , this camera would incredible bargain . d70s shined one best cameras its class since its introduction . example , it 1/500th second flash synch speed ( found no other camera but d50 ) so you keep ambient light under control avoid ghost images . its autofocus fast accurate , features both single-autofocus , continuous-autofocus ( tracking action ) , novel " automatic " autofocus mode switches af-s af-c required . if you no nikon lenses , get this camera 18-70mm kit lens , which very sharp versatile , rather than more limited 18-55 lens . you won't regret it	1
just what i needed out spend fortune glass filter protect my expensive nikon lenses . i bought one each my different lenses because i would rather break filter than glass lens	1
i this camera several months now could not happier . i'll preface this posting saying i always meticulous research ( borderline a%$l retentive ) before making purchases over $400 . this camera no exception . i using " credit card " camera before often disappointed results . this camera corrected big way . pictures crisp video files very good ( although they hog lot memory ) . you must upgrade memory card provided . battery life me equal credit card camera i past . if you take lot videos battery life shorten . i carry extras my case . always amateur " photog " this camera excellent upgrade . weight feel camera perfect me . i friend who nikon . only real difference i see he change lens various situations , oh 500 bucks . overall this very good camera .	1
i bought this camera based several online reviews , including steve digicams , couldn't more pleased . i've using it since last christmas ( bought it present myself after six months looking various brands models ) . aside image quality ( which it plenty ) i insisted least lcd viewfinder ( evf ) well screen , real filter ring ( no adapters , please ! ) easy basic controls , long optical zoom , cf card , hot shoe ability use ordinary aa batteries pinch . also fit my hand feel natural . this all , plus actual cable release socket shutter button ! ( thus i easily use my cable bulb releases , well long-duration timer i my 35mm kit . ) it also standard pc socket more flash options than built flash or hot shoe . heft good , but not very heavy . you carry it long time without fatigue , but it enough mass steady your hand , enough size easy gripping . i find it very instinctive point shoot it . most basic control locations convenient easily remembered . ( zoom manual only , but suits me . i don't like waiting motorized zooms get where i want , especially zoom range this long . ) i'll leave it pro reviewers discuss image merits , but i say me they seem perfectly sharp very good color even default settings . addition , i've gotten very good results shooting night very long exposures . ( starry sky , clouds backlit moon , streets under moonlight streetlamps , etc . ) much less noise " grain " than i've experienced other cameras . so far it closest film i've found such situations - any price i afford , leas t.t he electronic viewfinder ( evf ) bright sharp performs well low light . i don't miss optical viewfinder much all . there diopter adjustment accomodate most people visiion . ( stops just short enough my worst eye - comes closer than most , though - but i find i use efv my glasses if i want ) . one accessory i strongly recommend soft rubber , wide angle , lens shade ( 58mm filter ring ) . they found cheap ( i paid $7 local store ) protect rim lens when you set down camera addition shading lens . there included hard-plastic lens shade clips outside lens rim , but t " notched " i worry catching it things - i like soft rubber ones better ( they look more " pro " too ) . it may interfere supplemental illumination lamp focussing , so you'll want remove it when shooting close mid-range photos dim light	1
( wife account holder)i knew before i bought this camera it just what i needed ! i am semi-pro-am photography hobby job . i knew i didn't need $5k camera we work , but wanted something more than my $200 point shoot . this it ! out box , it took 15 min take my first pic . hardest part threading camera strap lens cap holder - nice little detail . main selling point me " natural light " mode . tried flash without mode quality amazing . my little ps didn't any good low light without flash , this camera gets a+ . few minor notes i wanted make before i lovestruck : lcd screen no protection , just kind out there open . cover or even just little plastic stick-on most low end cameras come would enough make me feel like it isn't going bust . viewfinder really just mini-lcd screen , which i imagine bit number batteries , though not much full size lcd back . menu looks pretty extensive , but fairly easy navigate once it becomes little more familiar . so far , i love it , but took off one star because lcd issue . maybe i find cover or something it help me feel better it . other than , i already tell this camera everything i need take great pics get creative some manual settings exposure manipulation . love it takes xd cf cards - both camera same time ! save movies one , pics other ! it feels pretty solid , takes super inexpensive aa batteries - selling point me , hot shoe sync capabilities . if you looking go slr , but can't fork out dough , this perfect alternative . ( though check around price - [ ... ] rebate , i got mine less than [ ... ] !!	1
i paid $225 out door this camera it competes cameras almost twice price ! automatic setting , it takes incredible photos , but capability go manual if you so inclined . price , there nothing market comes close . macro this camera great close ups i taken even automatic setting unbelievable . if you looking something slr like , but not slr price , this comes close . course , slr take better photos if you expert , but if you amateur or intermediate photographer want something gets job , put this one your list ... taking price into consideration this thing doesnt disappoint . you glad you purchased this one !	1
wonderful camara , excellent characteristics , ample selection accessories available protected one you lead manufacture camaras lenses	1
i purchased this my s2 instead third-party adapter . only issue i it black instead silver ( doesn't match camera ) . i also make sure i purchased correct camera bag hold camera lens adapter attached	1
works great my s2is , clicked silver main page but switched black order form , didn't notice this but i like black anyway . looks good acc	1
what wonderful camera . photos come out sharp clear . small size makes it very handy carry around you all times . photos load very quickly computer . price i would rate this " best buy " . i found only one drawback which i feel minor . very bright sunlight it difficult see object screen unless it shaded hand or piece paper or cardboard . but this minor problem would not stop me purchasing second coolpix l4 . you purchase 512 or meg memory card very little money . check amazon kingston or sandisk . i both they great .	1
i simply love this camera , it very tiny size takes great pictures you buy rechargable batteries or regular batteries if you should choose . it simple use , didn't even read manuel . starter camera or advance user , get this one , you love it !!!	1
seems little much pay " extension cord " but upon receipt i see it very high quality nice build connectors . plus , its brand item canon , so what you	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
i purchased this lense novelty inexpensive 1.8 lense . i use this low light sport situations like basketball or volleyball - especially gymnastics where flash not allowed . i'm not huge fan locked into focal length , but anything under 2.8 you don't choice . this definitely not primary lense indoor sport shooting , but it fun companion when you need speed 1.8 indoors	1
very happy lens , price definately right amateur like myself	1
first all , i am amature photographer , still learning curve . i avid film slr ( minolta xg1 ) user until i bought this camera . after extensive research , i finially purchased d50 . over one year later , over 15,000 shots , i couldn't happier . pictures just amazing . camera quick what you want it . if you point shooter , or someone who not like make adjustments optimal picture , this camera not you . i believe most people problems come lack experience , bad lens , or rare situations , bad camera . you must patience this camera get best out your pictures . pros :::: * sharp , sharp , sharp - always depends your lens - i shoot nikon 18-200 vr , even get wonderful pictures off sigma 70-300*instant start up*instant pictures - press button picture taken immediately*all manual control you could want*great autofocus metering , once you learn how use it - i shoot aperture priority autofocus*great pictures stright out camera - i rarely post-process*sd cards - i love small size quick write read speed . plus price keeps dropping*nice lcd - large , gives idea what photo looks like , but not trust it ( any lcd)*absolutely amazing battery life - i taken over 300 pictures ( without flash ) battery still reading full strengthcons :::: * not ideal indoor/very low light situations . bad noise high iso , poor built flash*no light top lcd screen*i don't really care " dummy " scene modes - this just may due fact i haven't used them extensively*it hard get used small viewfinder when compared film viewfinders . but i eventually get used it*may too small big handswith low light problems , i am looking into fuji f30 , since most my low light pictures friends i don't want carry around bulky dslr ! overall , i couldn't happier ! it may cheaper than most other dslr , but power lays lens photographer . it awesome camera i learned so much . hopefully i this gem while come	1
long time film person , i really wanted find digital slr could surpase feel quality film without guess . other digital cameras basically point shoot versions . two children athletics year round , d50 it all . we've shot over 3000 pictures past three months just soccer softball . nikon software makes converting storing breeze . only thing missing protector viewfinder , it standard d70 now d80 . there aftermarket available fine dept . i recommended d70 so many people nikon must put me their marketing team	1
make sure check compatibility charts verify your lenses work this before buying it since only handful series lenses compatible . if you already one or more these lenses though this nice addition . af only works lenses f/4 faster most camera bodies . you also give up little image quality putting this your lens camera body , but extra reach really nice	1
i've my canon a510 over year i still love it . i've taken it vacation me several times , including one trip yellowstone park , where i took 1000 pictures . it great . it small light i like way it fits my hand . it fast . i never spend time waiting it . it takes great pictures ! it uses 2 batteries batteries last longer than my last camera lasted using 4 . only problem i've occassionally lens cover stick not completely open . i just barely touch it my finger it unsticks opens rest way so that not major issue	1
i initially bought this switch able take fireworks pictures my 30d tripod . it worked well this application . got some great shots fireworks . since used it some wildlife photos it works well this application also . cord camera switch only two feet long . sufficient use tripod , but perhaps just little short any other application switch . i consider it " overpriced " what it , but if you need manually operated remote switch , it performs this function well . release button option where you lock-it " " . it useful if you what leave your camera shutter open long exposure . i didn't research any other brands remote switches my canon 30d . there may others , but i hurry something before 4th july , just ordered it , since i knew suppose work my camera . it performs it intended design function . it overpriced , my estimation , but if you need one , this one perform job .	1
rs-80n3 works advertized . cable could longer but other than i am totally pleased	1
i own this hood canon digital rebel xt . i like hood . it works well limiting stray light well protecting lens . you hear many experienced photographers ( i'm amateur ) , they would never shoot pictures without hood lens so why would you ? all hoods expensive what they , piece plastic , but they serve necessary function . get hood if you want best your lenses , including this lens 50mm 1.8 ii . i would give it 5 stars but it pricey	1
wow ... now if you really want see rip-off , here it . not damaging amazon.com but hey 50mm just get some carboard tape it front shield it sun . hood definitely not worth it	-1
this great ' only lens ' day . good weight vs capability handing most photo opportunities you'll come across . good price versatility function provides	1
i bought rebel xt w/ 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before xti introduced , but that story . this my first dslr , i blown away results . but after initial euphoria , there always room improvement . my first choice 28-200 , favoring longer zoom over , but i found this one used penn camera got deal it 380ex flash , so decision made me . i like zoom range , it great framng portraits . if i need wider angle , i still kit lens . i won't make usual complaints herky-jerky zoom ring or rackety extension tubes , i prepared this these reviews before i ever saw lens . i'm no expert sharpness , still trying get myself dialed , but my shots so far look pretty sharp me . i no " " lenses compare , nor would i make comparison if i . my somewhat uninformed opinion , this great step up kit lens . this lens working guy afford most likely get great results . working guy , i'm extremely happy it so far , glad i made purchase .	1
it would cost you more buy these separately . battery alone could cost this much . rest accessories come handy . i originally wanted this only battery , but now , i options . great value . buy it	1
although this good batch accessories , camera case itself little unhandy times . it no carry strap -- camera strap sticks out through slit top . so , if you want carry case strap you decide take picture , you must open case , pull camera strap through slit , then lift camera out . it would not keep me buying this but it make it unhandy	1
i bought battery grip , based fact my rebel xt small camera , when using it my last model shoot , someone mentioned it looked like �tourist camera�which pretty depressing , since adding grip not only i more than enough battery life my camera , it also pro look people recognize , even though i still believe it not camera , it eye behind it counts , good looking camera always welcome	1
i've used battery grip almost every canon camera i've owned since 1980 . this rebal xt battery life seems almost forever battery grip , gets doubled . grip also allows you use regular batteries so you could use them should rechargables ever die you need keep shooting . it adds shutter release button turning camera 90 degrees . larger hands would probably find camera more comfortable more grip area . it adds more mass which pro ( little more stability ) or con ( heavier carry around ) . it would nice if canon could slightly remolded it stand camera up . it , camera lean forward it lense . bottom line : i'm glad i purchased but think it could much cheaper . when you consider ( way back when ) these types devices added motor winder ( standard modern film slrs not used digital cameras ) added battery capacity . all this adds additonal battery capacity . price reason 4 stars instead 5 . course most businesses don't care long people buying . mark	1
canon bg-e3 battery grip one awesome extra you cannot without . i found extra weight size not even minor burden . i rec'd product 2 days after initial receiving date/17th st photo fantastic job ( once again )	1
i compared number pro-sumer cameras became firmly convinced this best camera money . although nikon one time considered premier camera professional , they now take second stage canon not only engineering , but quality lens , innovative user-friendly design , overall quality . i used camera approximately one month delighted . talken pictures over 35 years - including professional - always using minolta equipment all those years , i am truly enamored this canon camera	1
this very easy use camera . simply using auto mode composing your pictures properly you get very good jpeg images . it also complicated you want make it . it many advanced features it . i shooting 35mm 32 years . my most recent before this one elan ii 7 years ago . it still working also . 30d my first digital i absolutely love camera . i generally work aperture priority mode tripod 100 iso when shooting landscape . but , camera very capable auto mode well without tripod . i like shoot raw so i tweek things bit , but jpeg images very acceptable . it also works extremely well portraits . it actually better than 35mm me because it very low noise even higher isos . 1600 looks like 800 film me . this very good value money my opinion	1
this lens works very well two amateur photographers like my wife i . we take photos our kids their sports activities . even though lens little heavy side feels like we shaking little when we snap picture , none our shots come out blurry . i am pleasantly surprised this . we feel it well worth price we paid . ( under $100	1

i am delighted this product . i am really grateful all reviewers this other similar products . image this unit fabulous ! i not any problems it whatsoever . one improvement i would like see stand helps unit prop itself up . it would benefit more secure attachment picture frame so when you pick up frame , stand comes it . this isn't any kind major issue so long you know how it works , you just pick up frame stand same time . i would highly recommend this product price .	1
camera works great , took it my vacation used it , videos cme out great !!!!!	1
this great digital camera . i no problems it . i got it my 1st anniversary 2 yrs ago . its great ! you take pictures , put xmas , valentines or birthday borders around them b4 you take picture . it video too , you play back video , but there no sound because there no speaker camera , there mic thuigh . so when you download video , it play sound too . camera survivied dropped many times . i would like take long videos , so i am going purchase 4gb sd card . i feel sorry all people i saw complaining camera because i no problems 2 years now . only thing batteries die quickly ( using flash really drains battery ) , so i went bought high quality rechargable batteries , or disposable duracell meant digital cameras . also people who complained blurry pictures , it depends what setting you camera . i not like all those different setings , they just mess up pic . not use auto feature i always use non auto , egulr pic , flash . all those other settings confusing . oh yes great self timer when you noone hold camera	1
great size shape taking places . feels good your hand . boots up pretty quick . like color . impressed features . takes decent pictures . internal memory , well taking memory card . i suggest getting set good rechargable batteries .	1
because its shirt-pocket size , this digital camcorder easy bring family outings such . i originally bought it because i plan attending my sister graduation didn't want bring plane both my very large semi-pro canon digital camcorder my digital still camera all its lenses . i took pure digital business trip plane just check it out it great fun . simple operate , results surprisingly sharp . only two drawbacks : 1 ) like any small device , could easy drop it , 2 ) it seemed like batteries getting kind low , boot-up time getting longer longer , after 40 or so minutes recording . i recorded 55 minutes , it still working . but , if you need quick capturing precious/important moments , might want carry spare set batterie	1
i actually bought this case house my canon elura 100 , it perfect fit . i really like belt loop although video camera your hip little bulky . my one complaint : some trim this case pink . now , i'm not most macho guy earth , but it seems me tht sony could gone little more neutral tone . end though it very minor complaint	1
forget packing any accessories--there no room spare . think this one more " holster " keep camera your fingertips without lug around full-sized camera bag . i own both , but big one stays home or car most time . integral wide belt loop allows me mount it my fanny pack waist belt hiking , i especially like gussets , which hold camera securely while opening or closing zippers . shoulder strap also provided if you prefer . although not listed , dcr-hc96 also fits , albeit snugly	1
this case very designed fit camcorder perfectly . but it would nice if there little more space keep things like remote spare cassette atleast . case god cushion all sides which keeps camcorder pretty safe	1
these glasses small , protable good concerts quick bird work . i keep set car , but they not replace my larger busnells birding . please don't expect more than little backyard birding these , i am now adjusted my larger set , so i use those yard . you get what you pay	1
bushnell powerview 12x25 fine , small pocket-sized binocular . since my wife avid bird watcher , we already several binoculars various sizes viewing power . our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 bushnell we used trips , so i researched , then bought this one amazon her birthday . she loves it . viewing power bit greater than other every bit compact , which makes it easy pack vacations , yet provides good viewing experience when enjoying various bird populations around country . we both highly recommend this , other bushnell products	1
i am very pleased performance rechargable battery pack . i not yet recharge it , i taken numerous pictures few videos . i would replace alkaline batteries least twice this time . these should pay themselves no time . why i wait so long ?!	1
just got camera what i've seen so far it wonderful piece equipment . my only complaint amazon misrepresented battery type saying it , " powered en-el3a or en-el3 " which not true disappointing anyone who upgrading camera use those batteries ( ie d70 ) d200 uses en-el3e which doesn't same fit en-el3a or en-el3 . aware this if you upgrading	1
nikon d200 amazing camera . this review amazon packing procedures . this review alert prospective buyers amazon not pack these cameras well . i just purchased one it came packed like book , very little padding . i called nikon their recommendation return item pronto . i returned camera ( much trepidation)and purchase trusted source . just wanted give you all heads up	1
nikon always leader photography/ camera/ lenses . others nobly tried but nikon remains high bar others only hope reach . when shift film digital began , there some speculation if nikon could keep up competition . well , rest assure not only they kept up , they continue lead way . latest example this d200 . like d70/ d80 - this solid piece equipment . just feel it tells you you holding excellent piece technology . but proof always end results again , combination nikon know-how nikon lenses lead even beginner come up excellent pictures . gone " lag shots " . you fire up shoot multiple pictures seconds so action shots all yours . without even " tweaking " picture computer program , you print top line photos home . people cited cons : expensive . yes . camera come hefty price tag but it should kept mind this piece machinery intended serious photographers . if you " vacation holiday " picture taker , then you should elect buy cheaper camera . same true difficulty multitude small buttons , dials switches . there too many they overwhelming but only someone who " point shoot " school picture taking . anyone else relish options nikon provided us d200 . room improvement ? well , battery life nowhere near good d70 which i upgraded but weak complaint you still get hundreds shots one charge . also , it would boon if flash would automatically pop up when needed like former models . so if you serious photography always one ready , this one you	1
i recently purchased this camera when my venerable nikormat el-w developed shutter timing issues during my photo 1 class . this camera reasonably priced preformed flawlessly thus far . i shot multiple rolls ilford hp5 plus film through this camera yet exposure not come out due camera . after reading manual i able easily understand different modes how change user controlled settings . camera flash leaves little desired it rather harsh its range somewhat limited , accessory flash overcome this there other flashes operate this camera not just canon . i not opportunity shooting color film through this camera yet when i i update this review . only thing i dislike this camera there no provision remote shutter release . rebel k2 date only version this camera use remote shutter release , why canon removed this feature this model unknown remote release very handy when photographing nature or when used timer self portraits . if you any plans infrared photography not buy eos canon , frame counter uses infrared sensor cause fogging your infrared film	1
soy un principiante en esto de la fotografia , esta ha sido mi primera camara slr , por lo tanto me ha tocado experimentar con ella para obtener las mejores tomas posibles la vez que han aumentado mis conocimientos en el area , el desempe�o es excelente tanto en tomas fijas como las que he realizado objetos en movimiento , tanto sus funciones automaticas como las profesionales ofrecen un desempe�o excelente , he tomado mas de 300 fotos en poco menos de cuatro meses , el zoom que tiene es rapido , los botones tienen una disposicion excelente para manejarla con una sola mano , lo unico que necesita es un flash de la serie speedlite , tuve oportunidad de conseguir uno prestado de un amigo el cambio fue estupendo ya que este tiene mas alcance para el lente que la camara trae , ya que el flash que trae carece de potencia el cual ofrece su mejor desempe�o en los 28mm del lente(no le podemos pedir mas un flash integrado ) , por ultimo les dijo que posee el mejor sistema de medicion de luz que existe en el mercado ( e-ttl)y esta disponible tanto con flash integrado como con el flash externo	1
we used this camera our honeymoon snorkling it great ! pictures little grainy , although i credit silt water more than camera quality since out water shots came out great too . lever front much easier use than push button strap perfect . we bought kodak hawaii when these used up picture quality significantly worse than fuji . we would definitely use these again	1
if you reluctant invest $$$ ' real ' underwater camera , this fine temporary solution . i realize it not rated go beyond 17 feet but i took two them 90 feet no problems whatsoever - all seals held i could wind film just fine . only slight critizism pictures come out more blue compared kodak max ( which i used same dive site year earlier ) . but hey , if you're going way beyond manufacturers specs , you're not really allowed complain ... snorkeling ( down 30 feet ) , pictures come out real nice	1
this cable works fine my sony dcr-dvd403 handycam . i play record s-video this cable . key change setting camera so it uses s-video instead default composite video connection . i found this my handycam user manual . it works exactly it should . perhaps this not case all sony handycams	1
previously i bought several ' no name 12mpixel ' camcorders whould produce great stills but left lot desired when taking movies . sanyo it all , excellently . excellent mic image stabilization this camera well worth price	1
filters included dramatically helped getting me one special shot i looking . i troubled glare such daylight looking way bring out colors . someone told me try filter i couldn't happier this brand . my pictures now come out right color balance great look out	1
i use uv filter my lense insurance policy . polarizer really makes difference highlighting sky/horizon shots . here southwest warming filter adds really nice touch lot my nature shots . very nice package overall price hit versus buying all three individually . fold up case also comes handy	1
i've this camera 4 months now i am very pleased it . pictures clear , focus quick options endless . this my 7th digital camera i purchased 2 close up lenses t-con 1.7 it which really made it versital . large manual zoom anti-shake best part camera . it very clear lens i like when focus manual it gives zoomed look what you shooting . fz-50 close dslr you get without all expensive lenses drag . manual settings let you set-up camera you personnel needs . i'm really enjoying this camera .	1
i'm not entirely new photography . i two canon pocket cameras ( 35mm ) sony digital pocket camera , so i some expectations what could . i say fz50 blown me away . automatic mode , it great point shoot . i doubt i'll ever use it video clips , but i've able include pictures my power point presentations very helpful . i slowly acquainting myself various modes capabilities , such macros closeups . this process take several months least . well worth price . quality outstanding everything works it should . i'm not sure extra memory ( 10.1 mp ) actually necessary , if you could get fz30 less , would actually better deal most folks .	1
this camera great , easy use clear results . we replaced cheap digital camera not near nice this one . we not professional photographers but wanted good quality , easy use camera family photos work needs well . we love it . its not one those extraordinary cameras all doodads but if you looking straight forward , clear pictures , its great	1
i am happy this camera . only it little bit outdated . but prce - performance ratio great	1
i don't think you'll find better camera around $100 , but it some downsides . most downsides it really really tiny lens . it says 36mm but that just 35mm equivalent ( not i expected 35mm lens it just i didn't expect lens small ) . picture quality still good especially medium distance shots high lighting , but low light hit or miss . it great camera vacation , or family photos most drawbacks won't even noticed these users . battery life camera really good i've taken 100 photos ( most flash ) battery bar hasn't even dropped . it also aut o-o ff feature save battery life when you forget turn it off yourself . this camera fairly easy use doesn't really alot features mess around ( or mess up ) so it great those fairly new technology . it also priced just right so you take it anywhere not worry too much it lost or broken	1
this my first digital cam . i looking good price , but also pretty good quality . i nothing but success this cam . it takes great pictures zooms subjects clarity i love auto timer 2 or 10 seconds . battery life isn't greatest but also not worst i seen . i would definately reccomend this others	1
just came back 10-day vacation disneyworld orlando , florida during holiday season . used this my sony dvd505 it fantastic . captured every single firework display without necessarily panning left righ vice versa . just propped my dvd recorder tripod it	1
good : wide-angle lens works great . i've mostly using my camera inside my subjects so close i need use this fit everything screen . not so good : i can't leave it - my camera bag too small . threads little small making it little difficult put quickly but certainly not hard	1
we not big users technology . this bundle very inexpensive allows us produce printed photos nearly no effort . camera straight-forward use , though not sleek some we've seen	1
i just got this camera recently printer . setting up very simple . only problem i came across putting ribbon printer . you use your finger remove slack ribbon but it not easy . when you put ribbon printer it gets caught something could damage ribbon . it takes time tons patients get ribbon printer . pictures come out very nice print even better . i washed couple pictures test quality they came out flawless . this camera value shouldn't passed up . screen camera huge buttons take some time get use too . if you any further questions feel free comment them i'll reply possible	1
i've s400 this housing two years now i've taken it least 20 dives . it gone me down 80 ft numerous times . no issues , no leaking . i am not exceptionally careful camera prep but i use dessicant - which i think no brainer uw photography . $170 this bargain lifetime . i love able use same camera both land underwater shots . i don't master two camera interfaces . after two years , even if it fails this point , i got my money worth 18 months ago , my opinion . i can't recommend this enough - anyone who nervous , just buy insurance your trip like other reviewers suggested - see how it goes . canon made fan life	1
works , which good thing ... it replaces single type card reader sandisk ( which still works after 8 years using it ) . windows explorer it displays removeable disk each type card reader it , all these extra " disk drives " confusing someone not fimilar computers or windows	1
features 30% more stamina than np-f960 rechargeable battery pack . i bought this after spending half day shooting sony fx1 very cold weather my np-f960 battery . pausing occasional power down , battery survived this bitter cold day lots juice left over . so imagine what this np-f970 you . i np-f960 clone battery , it isn't holding charge good storage . my only beef waiting it fully charge . if you serious videographer , or use sony hvl20dw2 20 watt video light , this definite " must "	1
great purchase ! case small fits 4 memory sticks . definitely recommend it	1
this little camera my first digital . it quality line samples convinced me . colors true life , not pastel look . this what i've looking . digital point shoot renders true colors . it very good clear view finder . unfortunately , it no diopter . but view finder this one very clear . lot you may not problem no diopter . i wrote canon expressing my concern view finders diopters still demand . lcd screen this washes out bright sunlight . movies this camera produces very good camera this type . i'm still learning how use scene modes , so not much share you there . i like " " mode changing iso settings " vivid " colors . ability change " ev " settings certain lighting situations big help , " auto " doesn't always achieve what you want . you ability change focus light metering . bottom line , you get lot bang your buck here . if you looking get started digital i , this certainly open lots fun interesting doors . experiment . take lots pictures . you fun while learning . i	1
after vigorous research investigation , i decided this camera because portability quality . bigger cameras may provide better hd picture quality but i believe you may lose lots opportunities since camera not your pocket . i used 4gb sd card take 1 hour hd video . two 2gb sd cards , i am pretty much covered most occasions . recent purchase 80gb portable hard drive i dump sd card , i don't worry running out storage . battery life also reasonable : i didn't measure actual hours but i used all three sd cards one charge . flash also relatively powerful , but like other digital camera built-in flash not effective once it passes 10 ft or further . ergonomical design best all like-kind portable video camera . i control button one hand without too much worry dropping camera . high definition quality not nearly good bulky ones such sony hdr-hc1 , but much better than average among same level pocket size cameras . little adjustment iso , you capture better images you want . however , iso 400 presents noticeable grain . 5 mp still camera image not good my canon digital camera but good enough print share friends family . overall , i finally settled down my seemingly endless research enjoy this camera	1
i purchased this polarizing filter my sony hc96 . sony store mall not it stock sony website also out stock . either it popular item or sony didn't produce large volume it . anyway , it took amazon least couple weeks ship it . i took filter my trip yosemite . it just advertised --- made sky more blue removed light reflections glass windows water surfaces . if you want keep reflections visual effect , you just rotate lens out effective meridian . protective lens came filter handy , too . first , i didn't know why i would need it because i justed wanted polarizing filter . it turns out it good protecting camera lens wind/dust water spray waterfalls when polarizing filter off camera . it seems pricy ($75 ) , maybe because it sony or because it not popular item . i'd say it not useful most occasions , esp . indoors . it luxury item outdoor shots hobby	1
lenmar msc-aa 1-hour mach 1 speedcharger seems all it promises . batteries charge quickly hold their charge well . my previous charger took approximately 24 hours charge 4 aa batteries , so this quite improvement .	1
charger works great . you charge each battery individually . my previous charger need battery charged pairs . built-in fan keeps unit nice cool , little noisy though . no problem here	1
this case great pictures kids underwater ! i also use it occasionally protective case trips areas where it rains lot- it protects camera very well . i wish i purchased it current sale price ! it little expensive when i got it ( half price camera itself ! ) but i no regrets .	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet . i use this filter my 70-300mm lens .	1
i wanted lense protection very low price . i can't see any difference my digital pictures betwen filtered unfiltered , using this filter . now , if i get dirt filter , or scratch , or whatever ... i just dump filter buy one	1
this really nice frame - looks like expensive black wooden frame . it extensive setup menu , but it really no-brainer . just pop card slideshow starts . cons : not remot	1

i using it almost year , i got it my mother , she loves it . pros : picture quality so good !!!! ( 7.1 mp)battery life superb , probably one best small cameras . lcd sizeno redeye ever !!! very few cameras this size thatlots featurescons : video not very impressive , quality goes down considerably when you make it full screen 15 inch monitor.it still very expensive , almost 300$ even now , i still think it expensive camera , but i guess it worth qualityi didnt use software comes this so i dont know if there cons or pros related .	1
i really like this camera ! it fairly simple use , takes great pictures packed features . it fits nicely hand compact enough slip coat pocket or purse . we bought this camera our daughter birthday . she using it ease especially loves movie sound option . my opinion , camera winner any adult or kid wanting good all around digital camera . my only negative it battery hog . most digital cameras , you want make sure you get rechargeable batteries large memory card	1
this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . even close-up photos turn out great . you would think this camera more than 3.2 megapixels ! you get much larger memory card though , case most digital cameras	1
this amazing camera , simply put . compact portable incredible detail satisfactory low light functionality - i love it . ergonomics easy get used battery life not all bad either . if you hunt around , you hear complaints low light quality , lack hdmi , lack mic input , etc ., etc ., but fact , i've found no issues this camera after shooting ample footage nothing but amazed watching output my hdtv . if you're not professional videographer , techno-snob , or av geek , but ratehr average family man like me who simply wants great up-to-date camera even your wife throw her purse use whenever wherever ease , this no brainer buy . two thumbs up	1
canon it again ! i got rid gl2 order reduce size camera got real gem ! now we more movies because camera so much smaller they all hd ! great little camera	1
anyone needing several hours shooting or picture taking away outlet source , extra storage capacity providied this pack almost vital . recharging taken 20-60 minutes which fits my schedule . i find this power pack greatly enables convenience long shooting periods	1

this my 4th underwater housing , second sports pack i used . it works great my hdr-hc3 , keeps it clean dry boating outdoor adventure . not heavy-duty like housings designed deep water , but fantastic snorkeling fishing trips . cons : hard see display screen unless you exact right angle control buttons somewhat small hard use smoothly .	1
overall it what it supposed . compact size plus . only complaint view gets dim when you zoom cloudy day .	1
fact this little light so bright both pro con . if you low light you don't want use night shot , this good light bring out colors whole room . it also small stylish while your camera . easy carry anywhere because it comes it own pouch . problem also same benefits . fact this light so bright , you get similar reaction people when they camera , " get thing out my face , i can't see ! " it so bright you can't get anyone look into camera . they're always squinting . but i figure that downside any light . if you feel light necessary your camera , this good light	1
i already owned sony z1u , paid $6000.00 several months ago , paid this canon lot less quality lot better , great low light , sony much noise same circunstances	1
this camera great . its low light performance high definition really great combination . side side tests i sony fx1 v1u it beats both low light performance lower noise . it many manual controls which key me picture manipulation settings cannot beat comparable cameras .	1
this my first camcorder ever i wanted it right . buying sony 505 great choice . large 3 inch touch screen really nice all controls extremely easy use . within minutes i recording my kids playing . i also love fact you record dvds well memory card . you really get what you pay when it comes this camcorder . well worth it !!	1

i bought this last year ago after my wife raved hers . it lived up canon name takes excellent pictures . i haven't taken time yet figure it all out but even movie option great . i love camera low price i paid .	1
i've my camera almost 2 years now . it great . i haven't any problems it , no lcd cracking or purple stuff . i dropped my camera before , i would say 4ft+ onto cement it barely left dent , it still works good new . picture quality awesome also video feature really good . i love it . but one con there no battery indicator thing , it only blinks low battery when it die , but pros this camera definitely weighs out one con . also , few reviews i read , some people said you'd take extremely good care this camera because it really sensitive . but honestly , i haven't taking care my camera . i don't carry it case i always either it back pocket my pants or my purse or i'll just hold it my hand actually it banged around couple times , but i hardly any scratches it except tiny dent one time i dropped it . pros : durablesmalllcd screen hugeit doesn't lagit cuteexcellent picture/video qualitylong battery lifecons : no battery indicatori definitely reccomend this camera everyone :)	1
i took delivery one these bags today because i've just purchased hdr-fx1 i'm walk around japan three weeks : oh joy it :-) i presumed bag container camcorder nothing much more but i wrong . firstly it very well made ( china course ) padding side walls ' roof ' exemplary : 3/4 inch thick . it good rubber feet quality zip . fabric excellent quality used similar before i attest its durability . camcorder fits perfectly inside no rattling there movable/removable velcroed partition hold lens hood separately if you prefer . supplied shoulder strap ok usable but i immediately ordered op-tech bag strap because i'm like ... strap attached hold bag horizontally or vertically you choose . attachments heavy duty steel rings bag usual clips strap . where bag really scores its additional storage . it large fold out pocket each end which hold quite bit smallish items ( my electric shaver vanished inside one ) . it also large front pocket running width bag which happily hold ( tested ) canon 10-22mm lens lowepro case canon 580ex speedlite its case room spare . you tell i'm mixing my slr kit my video kit but you could fit most video accessories bag . back bag zipped pocket ( flat ) containing rain hood . pull out hood wrap it around bag make it very water resistant . this covers whole bag except base ( i think , not tested it but look amazon image ) includes what top bag , it finest moment ... bag tripod holder !!! oh joy , i didn't know this when i ordered it it makes my life next few weeks so much easier ! top bag cunning set straps folds fabric lock small medium pod down securely . you still open bag extract camcorder even tripod place ( genius ) i remove pod few seconds . finally : sony either very lucky or very astute because tripod attached all pockets full bag exactly matches dimensions typical flight bag restrictions ( lufthansa spot ) . coincidence ? maybe but darned useful sure . conclusion : this worth every cent more . i happily trust security my $4000 camcorder it that all there said .	1
pretty comfortable . could more practical couple inner pockets	1
nice piece glass . easily screws over existing lens . job nicely allowing zoom through no unsightly bending around edges . attractive price too .	1
i love this camera . i would suggest this camera anyone looking . it takes great photos easy download	1
i several digital cameras this tops them all !!!! everything they say it , true . i love not even think batteries , i didn't believe what people said battery life , i just happy i didn't need think batteries , but i just got married my 13 year old daughter took more than 100 pictures this camera her pictures almost good photographer i hired yes camera battery lasted all day thru next 4 days our honeymoon 200 pictures taken , no low battery light !!!!! i even going buy my parents one . also , one more note i love how fast you take pictures , no wait 4 seconds shots . i kodak digital before only 1 1/2 years old hated it , i hated download procedure , it didn't put your pictures onto your hard drive , but it own little cubbyhole trying attach them your email absolutely nightmare , you'd identify picture copy it your desktop , remember what you called it then attach it your email . this main reason why i purchased this camera . i never own anything else , especially kodak .	1
my husband purchased this camera me my birthday last year . his aunt uncle one we thought it simply amazing . since our purchase , we've help several our friends family members buy same camera through amazon . actually , we've bought 4 other ones besides one my husband bought me my birthday . i highly recommend this camera everyone . it small , many neat features , quality pictures best i've ever seen any digital camera . don't just take my word it , buy one see yourself . it very affordable . ( best feature	1
i purchased camera after my old one ( casio ex z-40 ) broken since i loved my old one very much i concerned if new one would good old one . it 10.000 times better ! automatic mode helps unexperienced photographers take great pictures . but using individual modes settings results even better . i tested camera any situation during 6000 mile roadtrip across american west it not disappoint me all . only thing bit annoying everytime you switch camera it automatically go snapshot mode you switch through different modes again adjust settings you need . but surely there way figure out how avoid , i'm probably just not patient enough find out how since all other models casio cameras i tested not show this problem . overall , i highly recommend camera all types photographers !	1
1-25-07after my nikon 4300 stolen year ago , i bought nikon p4 april 2006 . bottom line : i get more photos acceptable p4 than 4300 but none great . 4300 occasionally produced superb shots perfect color incredible subtle detail . * my main interest photographing wildflowers . macro mode not focus close 4300 , there less detail what detail there not sharp , even " max sharp " option turned . color generally not natural finely graded even post processing . however , p4 not blow out highlights crudely 4300 . i take pictures yellow flowers fairly bright light still see some details all petals center . * p4 only shoots jpeg mode , no raw option . means 8 megapixel pictures smoothed internal algorithm into photo only quarter size original . three quarters information discarded so much 8 megapixel power lost . * mode i usually set white balance cloudy , sharpness max exposure +3 . this gives more pictures closer accurate . * photographing wildflowers i set timer 3 seconds so i brace my hands against my chest or rock avoid shake comes pushing shutter button . vr or off doesn't seem make much difference this situation . however , when wind blowing so flowers wave continuously , using vr normal makes difference getting adequate picture or blurry mess . 4300 could not take even adequate shots any kind breeze . * p4 seems optimized taking photos five ten feet away subject good but not super bright light . my photo water lilies taken top bank 10 feet away partly cloudy afternoon extraordinary -- sharp , perfect color detail . * 2.5 " screen excellent all but very bright sunlight . 3 " would even better . * lack better alternative , now i continue use my p4 but plan upgrade some point dslr , probably nikon d80 , which gets best reviews all sub-$ 1,000 models .	1
we took this camera trip austrailia , fiji , new zealand . vr great camera performed flawlessly . would buy again	1
i just received this device yesterday . i got play it hour so far . so , this review going " first impressions " or " initial quality " review . quality , packaging , instruction manuals , supplied accessories all look good quality . i couldn't find sd card packaging . i 2gb memory card me , so i ok . i could put battery , charge device , take couple pictures , couple videos without even reading quick reference manual . i would call intuitive enough user friendly . quality pictures video acceptable considering i used device straight out box without adjusting any settings . actually pictures video looked much better my home lcd monitor , but looked pathetic my work crt monitor . ( this not first time i experienced this . ) i played video 61 " widescreen hd tv using s-video cable quality acceptable . nothing compared off-the-air hd programming , but it not bad all . i placed couple pictures videos elsewhere web . amazon doesn't allow urls reviews . search google groups you may find link pictures videos . i come back here update review over next few weeks . update 4/12/2007 : i uploaded couple low light videos . link web site first comment this review . results disappointing . what i know now , i would probably give it only 4 stars . can't change rating now . i could quickly easily compile burn dvd using supplied ulead software . i didn't try any bells wistles , just used simplest path i production process 10 minutes . burning process itself ( 8x burner ) took long time ( unattended ) . dvd played fine regular panasonic dvd player . minidv based camcorders probably produce much better hd footage . but , not much use me , because burning dvd out minidv footage very hard . i don't think i could posted sample clips internet so quickly if i using minidv camcorder . so , should we compromise quality video or ease sharing footage ? update 4/16/2007 : this camcorder going back . while it very easy use very convenient quickly share footage ( compared minidv based camcorders ) , i don't think this replace my existing dcr-dvd201 due poor video quality under low light conditions . i am not kind maintain multiple camcorders use different one different situations	1
it perfect . i especailly like detachable side pouches carrying just camera . everything fits nicely it , cords all . this going really handy our trip hawaii april .	1
this bag perfect size . it carries my kodak easy share camera all its accessories ease . i love all compartments . they keep everything neat organized plenty room extra batteries , etc . construction bag also excellen t--t ough exterior shoulder strap option . highly recommend this bag !	1
this bag awesome , lots room everything . i looked all over bag large enough carry my printer dock all accessories , this bag even holds my camera accessories all user guides , etc ... etc .... you even store your camera too . i use smaller bag carrying my camera short trips but longer ones travel bag great !!!	1
there not much say this case . it more than adequate dvd or minidv camcorder lots room camera all extras .... charger , remote , tapes , etc . i would buy it again instant	1
sony quality every detail , it big enough all your handycam junk	1
if you looking entry level minidv camcorder , canon zr500 offers excellent value money . pros1 . very intuitive interface2 . high optical zoom3 . use joystick reduces number buttons just 3cons1 . motor noiseit also lacks still camera mode , though i don't consider drawback	1
i am very , very pleased this camcorder . it produces great photos videos . it small compact . price appropriate optical zoom numerous advanced options makes it one best options market . well , canon . thanks this great product	1
very good , small size , well made manufacture camera . reason i bought already waterproof camera-oly-720sw ., even if housing leaks it not compromise camera ., so it double insurance guaranteed longer lasting camera .	1
i never owned camera my life ( hubby always took all pics ) this perfect beginning photographer mom . it fits my pocket ( guess that elph part ) , we taken it two summer trips so far . i can't believe photos so crisp colorful , print up well ones we always developed drugstore . i admit my two young children helped me batteries , memory cards , understanding how get photos off printed . but if they it , i certainly learn . great camera i am capturing memories i might lost otherwise .	1
i'm amazed how my pictures turned out use this film . colors so vivid vibrant . images come out sharp . definitely film i'll using now	1
this camera best digital camera i ever owned . very active person , i needed camera would hold up anything . waterpoof , shockproof .... everything proof ! it compact size makes it great sticking your back pocket during night out town , or packed away your backpack while traveling world . large screen makes easy viewing your pictures all functions very easy use understand . this 7.1 megapixel camera taks great pictures aren't too large so they don't take up too much memory which makes it espescially easy upload your picutres onto social networking sites without reformat them . you definately get your moneys worth buying this great all around camera .	1
befores this camera i cybershot user ; since i believe this camera great characteristics : good flash level take close pictures , several especialized modes , compact size 10x zoom , great outdoors pictures ( vivids colorfuls ) . my main complain software : i not choose diferent flash intensity levels ( shots not well iluminated indoors really poor)and i not choose iso mode ( avoid bad pictures objects moving ) . besides night shots mode not good i expected . my general opinion this camera could really better if software would more versatile	1
this little gem camera packs mighty 10 times optical magnification into small but sturdy case . leica lens marvel design . it good easy read lcd screen very intuative menus . i now camera few weeks it lives up panasonics claims . i wish i could waited new models but i needed it my vacation . my wife refused entertain idea such large magnification range because lens size she envisaged , based past experience . she now completely won over	1
great little camera . i also dmc-fz30 , this one almost many features much smaller , less expensive camera . hard beat	1
i bought this camera my sister replace one i broke ( oops ) . it not zoom range her other camera , but megapixels higher . i borrowed it one day ( she let me ! ) see how it works . it worked great ! i high school gym taking pictures my son basketball game pictures not too dark came out pretty clear situation . i next step up camera 10x zoom 5mp not get clear pictures same gym ! i am very impressed she very happy	1
kodak camera dock makes digital pictures easy . push one button download all your pictures it charges battery same time	1
i wanted wider view camera this converter took care it beutifully . i'm very happy it	1
first off this fun accessory my a95 a80 . 26mm lens you shoot some very nice wide angle landscapes close-ups under $100 . lens sharp nice piece coated class . once mounted you zoom lens works inside adapter so you probably 26mm 40mm ( total guess)zoom lens . yes it barrel distortion , yes it stick out block flash , yes it black it look bit dorky camera . so either go buy digital rebel 19-35 zoom over $1000 or correct barrel distortion your image editing program , use slaved flash indoor shooting ( manual mode only ) paint it silver . bottom line ... if you like look wide angle , don't mind or even like very very mild barrel distortion ( ever so slight fisheye look ) , good silver paint , then price cheap hotel room or nice meal two , you lot fun this accessory . highly recommended !!	1
they what they supposed .. they batteries	1
this purfect , exactly what i looking , great price too .	1
this good product . i like way it automatically resizes pictures fit full screen . image quality excellent . it like always looking your photo album . one complaint - colored trim rings magnetic don't line up perfectly due magnetism .	1
nice compact it place everything i need my 35mm camera . shoulder strap adjustable makes it easy transport	1
overall i like case very much . it little big my canon powershot s45 , but extra room tolerable might handy later carrying other stuff . front pocket just right size my usb small card reader , extra cf card battery . i like dual protection camera ( velcro plastic latch ) fact lid entirely covers camera pocket ( protects against rain ) , it would nice hard case really bumpy rides . great product	1
easy use digital camera good features someone wanting venture into digital photography . canon not disappoint here . ergonomically well designed	1
this my first digital camera i am so impressed ! pictures very clear sharp . it easy use , even someone who electronically challenged like myself . my son(who camera buff ) recommended this camera me because canon reputation it definitely delivers . i looking something more megapixels , but he told me this camera would more than enough someone like me who takes pictures mostly family events he right . i would definitely recommend this camera anyone like me who looking easy use great quality camera	1
if it wasn't safety caps fall off easily i would rate this item 5 stars . however , binoculars great checking out sports like basketball football , especially if you can't afford pricy seats	1
i looking something stargazing . i read few reviews bought it . i couldnt see stars but binoculars if excellent quality , optics very clear without no color distortion . its reasonably light weight cost magnification . material very good doesnt feel cheap . if you looking binoculars take field trip , hiking , trekking , sightseeing etc this would pretty good	1
it good battery life but if only they make it smaller than it perfect	1
i'm casual photographer i don't permanent studio so i needed backdrop could set up taken down quickly . it also needed versatile durable . price , savage port-a-stand exactly what i looking . it breeze set up dismantle comes handy carrying case easy storage . although included paper bonus it generally too narrow my needs . so i'd recommend anyone purchasing this item consider how much width require consider buying wider seamless . outside i am very pleased this product	1
i am pleased all aspects camera . combining 6x optical zoom 10 megapixals allowed me lot flexibility crop my prints . stablizing must work , all my pictures sharp . there some lag time you push shutter button until camera takes picture	1
filter may cost bit more than some lesser filters but one gets what one pays . this filter kit complete plastic case pouch protect filter when not use . since it 67mm filter , toughtful touch because filter this large get scratched pretty quickly . what nd filter good ? think it sunglasses your camera . i use it allow slower shutter speeds when i want blur part or all my image . this comes handy when photographing waterfall when you want silky blur water rest picture sharp focus . it also works well car races where you might pan camera , staying fixed your target you shoot , creating effect blurring everything but moving car . very effective . those two main reasons me use nd filter . you won't use it often but when you , you create picture out ordinary .	1
this replaces my 2.1 mp digital elph i use when i don't want carry my big slr ( digital rebel xt series lens ) . positive : instant start-up , menu navigation zoomscreen quality comparable video ipodcomfortable intuitive button placementstrong flash ( camera size)modern/traditional camera aesthetics ( great looking)acceptable battery lifecamera operation obviously well thought outlow price what you getnegative : poor low-light shooting without flashlots noise iso more than 200no image stabilizationzoom ring spring little too strongplastic battery doorthis perfect pocket camera if you care more ease-of-use , aesthetics , size , price than trying capture print-worthy photo . overall i'm very pleased this camera , but only because i slr capture important moments/places . think great myspace photos rather than great family christmas cards .	1
pro photographer here . using so many different digital cameras .. because i am very picky . this camera fantastic . great looking sexy design . simple easy use . fantastic looking pictures .. fast easy small size fits your pockets . great micro function . great movie mode . sharp accurate color pictures .. best compact digital camera market . well always new things coming out surprise me but least now/so far this best one market right now- point shoot/compact camera catagory . canon makes great camera ..	1
i deal major brand cameras panasonic cameras my personal favorite ! i've seen people whine " noise " they make many times but never found it problem . i own fz10 fx01 my personal cameras . fx01 very fast camera takes great pics ! i love 28mm wide lens . compared most cameras i've used fx01 real good job metering light exposing images . i love panasonic solid build reliability . they may not popular canon or sony but my opinion every bit good .	1
good product but color not so attracticed	1
purchased birthday present my husband use his telescope . he used enjoyed this product several times	1
i bought this camera april 2006 it great ! however , july it just stopped taking picures ; camera would come one all functions worked , but you can't see anything lcd screen- it black . when you tried take picture it would flash , but picture itself black it still specs time stamp black picture . it like it taking picutres lens cap on- but it doesn't lens cap- which makes me think its somesort internal shutter problem . anyway i took it back store exchanged it same exact camera . guess what ?!!? new one only lasted one week !!! it same exact problem ~ ~ what chances this problem happens me twice ? now , unfortunately i lost my receipt , i mail my two week old camera off vivitar- where hopefully they fix it or perhaps i try out . don't waste your time or money there other cameras much much better ! only reason i decided this camera begin , large viewing screen , functions , video it easy work . oh .. btw .. if you use rechargeable camera batteries you save money regular double .. batteries don't last long	-1
zoom resolution amazing pictures generally turn out clear . " snapshot " function automatically adjusts settings seems little retarded , but " bestshot " settings numerous create good pictures . some great innovations i noticed this camera picture management software allows you view pictures your storage monthly calendar date taken . there other neat features , but i cannot think them right now ...... but remember i impressed . lolagain , zoom resolution absolutely amazing . because high resolution camera , even digital zoom creates clear crisp pictures many feet away . make sure you go through settings when you get camera disable " review " " record " buttons turning camera ( set it only allow power button turn camera ) ....... it way easy accidentally turn camera extend lens right into immovable surface . now serious drawback .......... absolutely horrible , disgusting , disgraceful , noisy high iso images . anything above iso 300 , pretty much , far archive quality	1
worth wile considering if you snap shooter growing enthusiast . great features mostly practical mini package , but prepared print out study manual beware some flimsiness [ battery cover , telescoping lens easily scratched exposed screen ] . don't overlook casio trade-in offer if you recent camera you like replace -- it could make purchase 850 true bargain !	1
my son plays competitive golf , so we golf course 4-6 hours . i follow take pictures mini movie clips my panasonic fz-20 . one battery last me least long sometimes longer i upload card my computer afterwards . this includes turning camera off during round . but i also forget turn camera off we walk down fairways , camera power save mode , it never problem . i always carry extra battery my back pocket , but rarely switch it out . i 3 batteries i rotate use . i just found panasonic superior product my needs	1
we bought 2 these battery packs our kids mp3 players . it saved us spending fortune batteries since they go through single battery two days . these batteries seem keeping charge least 70% disposable , since they four batteries they plenty back-ups . my only complaint when we ordered batteries we got one , but not second . i emailed company let them know please send second one . they not reply 5 days . they send second battery pack withouth further question . it just would nice get some response i least sent email right place	1
soon battery charged , we ready go . auto mode , it easy turn , point ( focus ) , shoot . especially love ( 1 ) speed which it turns ready go ( 2 ) large , clear display screen . additional modes available , but i only begun explore . downside , this model larger than other elph models barely fits into canon camera bag	1
i've purchased other bags but this one beats all it great price	1
well , i bought bino my 7 year old nephew introduce him birding . he loves it , infact he pronounced it " pretty cool " . good buy considering its compact what its supposed	1
this camera large screen very easy view . we satisfied all features this camera so far . wireless transfer function using our existing wireless network so convenient efficient . just need clean screen often because all your finger prints over glass screen when you hold camera	1
we bought this camera keep handy so it would always available around our newborn daughter . we bought case fits strap diaper bag/backpack/purse/briefcase this camera always ready when needed . size great !! we not intend buy professional level camera ( would bought d80 if i looking professional settings ) . this camera awesome !! response time quick , we not missed shot yet . when our digital video camera not readily avialable , it very easy shoot video s7c . battery life great . everyone who sees 3 " screen jealous it . picture quality outstanding . i've read several reviews mention problems blurry images delete pictures out focus ; i think these people must issues . i not seen one picture least bit blurry . i printed pics home my hp photo printer i photos printed costco , wal-mart , etc . quality always same ... awesome ! i researched months ( 9 exact ) before making my decision i don't think there better compact camera available . if you want slr features , buy slr . if you want best pictures small camera point-and-shoot features , buy s7c	1
this my first hdd camcorder . i owned several minidv camcorders past . i owned camera 2 weeks , so this review should considered initial impression . pros : - picture quality very good good daylight . i some shots night well lit family room , video not sharp day time shots , but still very good . - super nightshot feature fun take kids video while they sleeping . expected , video very grainy . - quality still pictures acceptable . - zoom very smooth- touch screen awsome . hope screen won't get scratched long run- camera easy use without read too much into manual- menu sort confusing some areas , but not too bad- lightweightcons : - pricy , compared minidv models similar quality- battery sticks out too much off back camera making it look sort ugly- allows only 3 still shots during video . i wish i snapshot still photos video like most panasonic models . - all connectivities charging base . this means one more thing carry vacation- no separate battery charger . battery charged charging base or camera- only 10x zoomoverall , pretty happy purchase , lot funs making family videos . i not make single dvd my previous minidv . this 4.5 stars rating	1
we wanted camera uses aa batteries ( convenience ) easy hold ( my young children when they take picture us ) so we bought this camera . i canon powershot a80 liked picture quality but it broke after three years use . a80 quite expensive time so i hesitate get point-and-shot priced higher-end . we very satisfied price , picture quality , functions a550 . only shortcoming a550 i noticed so far recharge flash quite slow ( even full battery ) so there longer-than-usual wait time before you take next picture after using flash .	1
i ordered nikon coolpix l6 ( 6mp digital camera 3x optical zoom ) then ran into friend party . he one i gave it try . slow fair pics . i went home , jumped online changed order canon powershot a550 . this camera slightly larger , but quick , good zoom , easy enough batteries takes wonderful pics . make usre you buy additional sd cards ' cause you'll love using this camera .	1
it takes little getting used but very similar any movie cameras out now ( focusing tilting ) . takes awesome pictures . i wanted camera small but least 10x optical those basball , recital , play pictures kids . i could never get close enough would get picture entire class stage . very happy now ! close ups items wonderful too . my daughter needed close up pictures flowers showed detail her science project i so impressed what we got ! my 10 year old take pictures without problem so shows you how easy it use . oh , yes , you see screen sunlight it very sharp image	1
i didn't want camera so small i would subject lose it ! i didn't want anything more than click shoot . i got just what i wanted solid camera clicks shoots without any fuss gives me clear great photo's!!i am totally happy ! should included started memory card case protect lcdmsladyja	1
i coolpix 2002 , liked it , but rather slow needed updated . new s10 great extremely cold temperatures(-60 degree windchill ! ) . it much faster than my previous digi . very happy it . haven't read up all features yet , but very easy use	1
works well . packaging item good package came destination good condition	1
this first camcorder i've ever owned . i saw it demonstrated shopping channel , eventually went shopping myself equal good price . it 2006 model , only around few months . after it just few days so far ... i'd say so far so good ! i'd say it fairly simple operate , offers great many bells whistles price . 32x optical zoom what sold me , it works like charm . digital zoom extends 64x 800x . i yet try out " super-zoom " . camera features stabilization control , but i'll admit its still tough keep it steady even 32x ! other features include night vision , live slow , automatic focusing control , auto white balance etc ... operate digital ( still ) camera well . if i make design changes , it would some operating controls , ff - stop - etc , outside unit , instead open lcd viewfinder operate many basics . only operational button within easy reach , release pause mode record standby . actually , button take " picture " right there too . battery power ok i guess . rechargeable pack ( included ) allows up 90 min average . upgrade 3 hr or 7 hr battery cost you !! no sd memory card included either . so end , if you compare features prices jvc competitors , i'd say they pretty well this one	1
this kit all you need start taking great photos online auctions websites . screen provides diffused lighting really captures all detail wihtout any glare . tripod not most stable , but it get you pinch .	1
i so excited when i got this camera amazon . why ? looks alone - flip out screen cool , like mini camcorder . it mpeg4 stereo sound which , indeed , very cool . , video great ! but where excitement ended . now i'm not technical but i've 3 digial cameras past so let me explain simple terms why this camera sucks . why this camera suck ? it bulky . they packed something better than standard 3x optical zoom i could understand but they didn't . pictures came out blurry darker settings . maybe i didn't make right settings adjustements ? but it worst standard settings all my cameras . flash weak . again camera this size you expect more . 5.1 megapixel camera only . not bad , but come one , my wife credit card sized dcs t10 7.2 , so again , why this camera so big if specs so ... average ... you need base station both charge camera view tv using av cables . considering base sticks out like sore thumb its bulky design its not something you easily take you unless you carrying luggage or something . bad choice . but here what really clinched it . after 3 cameras where lcd screen exposed i thought , wow , this screen protected inside so it never break - never mind none my screens ever broke before . so what happened ? two months after i got camera i dropped it waist level it fell little rock or something because i saw little indentation outside guess what - lcd screen all messed up . 90% unviewable . $450 wasted . i wasn't going put $200 get this junker fixed . bottom line ? best video i've seen , esp . size . everything else camera sucked	-1
when i sought purchase digital camera , i intrigued idea hybrid camera/camcorder . reading what written limitations these hybrids really dampened my enthusiasm . but i decided take leap sony cybershot dsc-m2 couldn't happier . it takes crisp , gorgeous shots automatic mode , although it doesn't many manual controls , it enough keep average snapshooter happy . movie mode surpassed my expectations . my little home films look like ones my dad made his expensive camcorder . it big , beautiful lcd screen which makes others envious . people complained design awkward , i joint problems , but handling it snap me . my only complaint i wish zoom function better ... otherwise , this excellent purchase	1
i purchased pentax k10d digital slr four weeks ago , am very happy this camera two lenses -- 18-55mm 50-200mm . shake reduction anti-dust features , you can`t go wrong . if you went canon or nikon , you would pay through nose their lenses . construction very solid seals help prevent dust water entering camera . features k10d make it joy use . i would highly recommend this camera anyone moving up digital slr . i am age 81 , so it`s never too late move up ladder . . . rhyn	1
i photography hobby over 20 years . i love pentax cameras because lightness lens compatibility this best slr i ever . i still need test some its features . but i am very happy quality pictures . i upgraded istds i got two years back . shake reduction come very useful when i take pictures my 2 year old son who not stay one place . i used get many blurred images ist ds low shutter speeds this camera handles very well . colors very natural i like fact i save images both raw jpeg same time . i usually use raw store my images jpeg web email . image processor may not good what u may find nikon or canon but raw images very impressive . i think i finally got right camera really replace my older film based pentax slr still i use all those expensive lenses i without spend more money . if u owner pentax slr many lenses wants go digital , there no better choice than k10d unless u lot money invest camera new lenses	1
i nikon lens pen cleaning system which i purchased fast easy way clean my lens however this system much more effective . cleaner phenomenal pre-moistened cloths come package easy use very effective . very compact 4in 2 1/2 cleaner tag my crumpler no problem . all dust particles i've my camera nikon lens pen cleaning system picked up completely nikon complete lens cleaner kit , i'm back crystal clear pictures again .	1
i simply love my nikon coolpix 4600 ! it so simple use offers so many features this perfect camera me ! i kodak digital camera but it big bulky , so i market smaller updated version digital camera . after doing some research i decided i wanted get nikon coolpix . it effective megapixels 4.0 , up 3x zoom over 16 scene modes . this such easy camera use . i basically point shoot check my results screen back . it red-eye fix which i love macro shooting choice well . one things i love this pulling out my memory card popping it into my computer . within seconds my pictures right front my my screen . i'm always impressed how great pictures come out . i love this camera ! i love size this camera well , it small compact , but not so small it hard hold onto ! nikon coolpix 4600 easy use takes great pictures , which makes this win/win me	1
fuji s5100 exactly one year now . meant write review after our hawaii trip last year . just back second annual trip remembered i hadn't entered review yet . first - you'll more satisfied more you use it . this my 5th digital camera first fuji . it really grown me . my wife rarely uses it since i take virtually every photo . but when she , i just set it auto , remind her how zoom , find pic just fine . i use 512mb xd . i routinely fill up card one set batteries ( almost all my shots 2mp setting which just fine most any purpose ) . but beware - use only high quality digital batteries . if you budget , here surprising find - buy kirkland 40-ct box costco . it only $11 they conveniently shrinkwrapped 4-ct bundles - great packing extra set . these far better than any other generic or store brand versions rival special batteries digital products . 512mb card , i never deplete batteries reviewing/deleting photos camera . download using card reader your purging pc instead . shots you might deleted using lcd may turn out interesting look when seen computer . , unless you really use lcd , learn use viewfinder it matches final shot pretty well it more discreet . here fail-safe insurance tip good shots . use fast shutter mode . there special button this top camera . this allows 3 shots time rapid succession . you select first 3 , last 3 or bracketing mode . i use last 3 almost every photo . just depress shutter camera starts shooting . when you release , last 3 shots saved . i always find least one keeper . ( bonus tip - only auto mode , you squeeze off up 40 row - try it knee level while following your toddler or during last 10 yards before finish line ) . i get incredible indoor shots without flash , using sports mode fast shutter while increasing iso 400 . sure resist urge zoom too far , shots get darker fuzzier dim light . use widest mode move yourself closer . great photos talent show without distracting performers flash . i recently discovered cool new technique using continuous af aperture mode . open up aperture highest level , set your iso 64 , find still subject interesting background . you'll get ultra crisp detailed view your subject background blurred slightly . very professional ! i use tiny 6 inch tripod night shots . there two timer modes . one 10 seconds one 2 seconds . use 2 second mode when you not shot . sure use bracket mode squeeze off 3 shots row . you'll get one regular , one brighter , one darker shot choose later . one technique i started using utilizing more candid shots less posing . you turn off beeper false-click sound using set up mode so your subjects less aware . while getting family line up group shot , try squeezing off few fast-shutter shots they moving around . you quietly zoom smaller group get some very interesting touching photos they'll never know . i think it relatively fast response time . it helps lot if you frame your shot before hand but it not really necessary . just squeeze half-way down so all you need squeeze all way right moment . when i can't frame exact shot , just pick spot approximately same distance frame substitute . this works well when there lots light . why won't i give this 5 stars ? it bit too big ultra portable briefcase or purse ( i travel lot ) i find some colors appear bland . i fix fair amount photo editor . but it still my favorite camera .	1
we very pleased product . we recently purchased brand ended up returning it mustek pf-a7005 . it easy use . we like idea able use regular flash drive .	1
i ordered this christmas gift my sister because i love one my husband got me mother day present . i love watching random pictures our family , friends , vacations often just stop what i'm doing become mesmerized . my sister her husband also enjoying it very much well	1
i bought this two reasons 1 ) i didn't large budget 2 ) i wanted camcorder palm-sized ultra-portable . i surpised how tiny it ( very ultra-portable ) controls simple easy learn -- perfect beginners like me ! i took it trip miami it worked great , though others found , it doesn't record very well low light situations , digital zoom grainy , but hey -- you get what you pay ! i first used aa batteries while waiting my ni-mh power up , they actualy lasted long time before i switched rechargables . i very happy my purchase , would given this 5 stars , it survived trip back maui ; i this my purse stashed under seat plane i may kicked my bag around bit . my pentax digital camera next it bag came through without problem , while aiptek doa . so , if you're rough your stuff , it would better idea spend bucks better , more durable camera . if you're gentle it don't big budget , this great little camera it little price	1
this camcorder pretty good . it perfectly priced , although amazon it higher price . good things : 1 . low price2 . camcorder/camera/voice recorder/mp3 player3 . very small4 . easy use5 . perfect kids who don't much money ! bad things : 1 . you need least medium-lit enviroment get good footage camcorder mode . 2 . only go up 512 mb memory card . 3 . ulead video editing software comes it doesn't let you many cool things , but picture editing one great . you should get this camera if you don't all much money spend !	1
i've amateur photographer almost 40 years devoted nikon user last 30 least . time i've owned every professional film slr original f5 , one time or , almost every piece glass 18 300 mm nikon ever produced . like many , i went through period only " best " my camera bag consequently paid premium own only " professional " primes zooms ( many which i still own ) . what constitutes good lens however not it performance test targets alone but how it performs real life . $1000 , pro level , 2.8 zoom useless if it so heavy you hate taking it you vacation . all money you spent " pro " performance useless sitting bag home . real life " user " , this lens hard beat . range covers focal lengths used large percentage pictures you want make , sacrifice 0.5 stops short end 1.5 long small price pay - unless you ( discouraged ) habit using slow ( iso 50 ) films handheld all time . lens covers it long focal length range surprising lack distortions - tribute designers - even usable " macro " feature . it equavalent my 105 2.8 af micro nikkor ? no ! but difference only shows corners wide open . occasional close up beach you might want grab vacation it performs surprisingly well . all lenses compromises this especially true zooms . this lens generally nice package stand alone vacation lens . or , if you prefer , couple it af20mm 2.8 nikkor old af70-210 f4 nikkor or newer af70-210 4.5 - 5.6 nikkor ( all using 62mm filters ) you very versatile travel package film shooters . my only complaint recent addition nikon d100 my collection bodies . 1.5 multiplication factor sensor makes this effectivly 42-157mm zoom body . consequently , digital shooter who " sees " wide this becomes unattractive range . if , other hand , you , like me , " see " better longer focal lengths , you now " normal " medium tele zoom macro capability . addition , since digital sensor only uses center lenses projected circle - this lens digital sharp my af180 2.8 nikkor prime film . my way shooting these acceptable compromises	1
if you looking extreame camcorder this one . i use it all my extrame adventures italy venice etc . i highly recomend this advanced users . his 5th camcorder i own . it produces great playback sound amazing	1
fit semi hard case perfect easily removed when using camera	1
i just got this camera christmas already taken tons pictures used video feature several times . its small design great feature , great students , styling absolutely adorable . my two complaints : 1 . lcd screen shows black what most would think well lit room . indicating need flash may more prominent than other cameras . 2 . camera not , any means , self explanatory . i absolute phobia manuals guides , so when i first got camera out box , i say only i amazed many functions fit into only 1 button . if you , like me , fear manuals , either not buy this camera or get trained professional ( or closest person near you ) help you figure camera out . one day time , my brothers sisters . one day time	1
when i bought my evolt e-500 it came genuine olympus battery , i bought knockoff use hot spare . admittedly they new performance degrade over time , but identical conditions genuine olympus lasts up 500 pictures knockoff barely 300 . i bought second olympus battery more confidence going out into field	1
i purchased two secondary brand batteries my olympus c5060 camera . price very good i thought i getting good deal . these batteries lasted one month then started indicate low battery after two shots . i purchased olympus blm-01 i am getting very good performance . beware sometimes deal looks too good true usually isn '	1
i bought these bird watching yard . focus them little stiff but i see well them any other binoculars i used . overall they seem good product money	1
this set binoculars performs it said it would , fantastic purchase price	1
this exactly what i looking for- small point scoot camera good zoom . it little tricky use but once you get used it it great .	1
ok someone go who doesn't extra usb port their laptop spare . forty dollars it bit expensive but what i say , it works	1
package real money saver-almost half cost what i could buy it office depot or even walmart . it arrived within 5 days right my doorstep ! also no shipping charges which real bonus those us living hawaii	1
i would given this 5 stars if info amazon/kodak website little clearer batteries . this camera dock not charge " rechargeable " batteries . you buy recharger . website says dock used recharging your camera but nowhere documentation came camera it say anything recharging dock . i think this mis-information , but we love camera anyway it takes great pictures . printer prints excellent prints also	1
this decent , pretty standard bino harness . if you're still using neck strap , benefits harness you don't sore neck end day , your binos don't bounce swing your chest you walk or other activities , it slightly stabilizes your grip while viewing . harness highly superior neck strap !!! down sides this model : quick-release clasps actually little tricky unclasp . maybe this good thing if you super-expensive binos , but i find it little frustrating . also , plastic strap-junction pieces aren't designed quite ergonomically they could . there big " nikon " logo back i wish wasn't there . but if you find it competitive price , go it . downside : bino harness makes you look like you're some tool thinking he tough because he wearing pseudo-gun-holster ( ie gareth keenan cell phone holster " office " ) .	1
i got hc7 couple weeks ago am really impressed image quality . i originally tried sony hdr-sr1 but put off its dismal low-light performance . hc7 much better front . color tends wash out bit , but noise not overly prounounced . however , bright outdoor lighting , picture quality absolutely stunning . regards photos taken hc7 , i haven't printed any out yet , but i've viewed some my 1080p they look very good . overall , i am happy camper . perhaps unfairly , i gave this 4 star only because it lacks 3 ccds .	1
i reflex nikon cameras previously this my first digital camera , im not disappointed . wonderful quality pics , very customizable , lot options course easy use . worth money . 5.1 megapixels enough quality photos superb . wi-fi bit more complicated non-advanced computer users , but works fine if you search through forums read how setup . construction camera solid , very confortable hand , but you must good pulse your hand or pics could distorted , otherwise excellent product .	1
i got this christmas , i notice price dropped lot since then ! good points : - nice small size ; easy pocket , lightweight - easy use controls . i like adjusting iso/flash/wb - automated red eye removal works nicely , auto enhance - new lower price ( wish we paid that)less good : - not sure pictures stellar without editing - shutter lag slower than i expected , particularly flash - wifi transfer difficult xp firewall . i've updated this review . owner manual under ports gives 2 settings windows firewall allow camera use wifi firewall . works great , but may not someone who doesn't understand these issues . documentation not describe this problem , you apparently understand issues . - must remove battery charge , flimsy plastic keeping it i'm afraid going break . - picture organizing software not great . i want able delete photos , only " some " directory views them . i'd also like easily lighten/darken change color tinting . i keep going back print shop poster making software ... i agonzing over this vs canon a610 . i didn't likethe canon larger size or 4 aa batteries required . i suspect pictures may better however ...	1
i lot review verious camerias prior purchasing this one . expecially comairison reviews number resourcs . this one floated top list though little more expensive than i wanted , used it , it worth every penny . features far numerous note here , but let just say camera beyond great . what ever complaints you your present digital camera ( if you one ) , this camer probably solves them . you read manul most super features , but it well worth it . borrow saying old tv add " buy it , you'll like it "	1
i've this camera two years . compared other cameras i've used , this digital camera very fast . only five megapixels , i've managed take some really fine pictures amazing detail . macro mode excellent . this camera also very durable - i've dropped it least twice hard floor but nothing broke . after using it obsessively two years though ( i literally attached this camera ) , camera lost some its reliability . example , when i'm automatic mode , camera would randomly switch review mode no reason . also , when i take pictures using self-timer , pictures now sometimes turn out blurry - it doesn't make sense me because nothing holding camera moving ( subject isn't moving either ) . also , this camera rather bulky heavy compared some compact digital cameras out market today . this camera little confusing use ( even manual ) when trying control settings manually . my photography professor told me canon cameras best manual picture taking . nonetheless , i really think i got excellent use out this camera time i've it - i'm quite satisfied	1
i appreciated they sent product quickly us . it right part worked correctly	1
grainy iso 100 pictures any light conditions . usage 5mp low sharpness options partially solves problem , but if you take pictures panasonic dmc-fz7 compare ... it clear garbage trash right place this camera . i panasonic dmc-fz7 only cons . really noisy high iso sensitivity mode . fz8 camera panasonic implemented venus iii processor ( fz7 venus ii processor ) . result picture quality really improved high iso sensitivity modes but dramatically changed worse iso 100 mode	-1
i just bought cannon 8x25 binoculars through amazon . because this purchase other heavy 35mm cameras i own , i though this shoulder harness might nice . after comparing similar products i bought this through amazon partner adorama due its low price , inclusion " metal split rings " " micro-fiber lens cleaning cloth " stated amazon product description section . problem neither rings or cloth came packed product . i could return it spend 50% what it cost me just so but that insane . since amazon provided description , i think they should credit me back something re-write description too . product seem well made money when i just tried it my camera binoculars it seem perform well . this god send avoid sore neck	1
i am completely satisfied overall value this camera . picture quality great it very easy use . lcd clean bright . video capture lacks little , but price i don't think you could get any better .	1
i got this camera my daughter christmas ... it great little camera !! small enough she throw it her purse go it takes great pictures . it many cool extra little features too ... like memo movie . only fault we've found it not come memory card . not big deal it internal memory , she just went out got new memory card hold extra pictures . i'd highly recommen	1
i impressed my friends my pocket photo album , referred few new customers while i it . not only it great technology which easy use , but it slips into your purse or pocket great way share pictures your dogs cats ; i make people look all five mine . you also share photos your kids , your latest trips , or even blackmail photos last party you attended . it also really cool design my " artsy " friends like colors fact it tiny	1
my son ( he 21 ) recently announced he wanted telescope christmas , so i got on-line educate myself . didn't take too long before my head began spinning ! so , make long story short , this scope i ended up buying . my husband immediately set it up blast it ! don't know if my son really get it now ! i definately recommend you buy accessory kit it also . i really enjoyed coming home work today looking all craters moon	1
i purchased this battery my panasonic fz7 except little high price i am very happy it	1
camera exceeded my expectations . some people stated customer reviews their camera case leaked ruined digital camera which made me hesitate purchase . i read other people reviews stating you must follow instructions ensure watertight seal which i made sure i followed . camera took some beautiful underwater pictures while i snorkeling hawaii . i would recommend it anyone wanting take some underwater pictures . my wife only complaint i took too many underwater pictures filled memory card . just make sure you follow directions you not run into any problems .	1
this camera great . i haven't used it much but times i its really nice , quality movies really good . i also liked i didn't need any tapes . would big hassle . main reason this camera purchased because i getting married it job quite well . i would recommend if you doing any outside filming need sound other people get microphone . i received one free amazon when i bought camera . it made sony camera . i would recommend this camera other people .	1
camcorder great . good picture quality , easy use , organizes your videos date , easy play back tv , remote makes it very convenient . battery life fairly good , but you may want spare if you'll recording more than couple hours time . i record highlights all day family outing still battery spare . software really falls short , i wish it half user friendly camcorder . it doesn't organize your videos well camcorder , dvd creation confusing rather limited . software documentation also limited , confusing , not always accurate	1
- stiff attractive leather case contours camera perfectly protects it against knocks scratches lcd screen . - includes belt loop . - when attached belt , camera slides into case like gun slides into holster . stiff leather strap wraps itself over top snaps place . therefore there small gap top- so you probably don't want this out rain	1
camera accessory kit perfect s230 because it didn't come camera case elph models so small , this kit provides kind protection this little camera needs . it comes smaller leather case camera itself then large purse-like carrier lots pockets zipper pouches . it thin case , not too bullky , soft interior pockets storage cords , user manuals , there lots room other stuff too . battery comes it useful because i battery came s2300 year or so it takes longer longer charge up .	1
binocs really nice sharp , but you purchase just good less . eye pieces difficult get used , but viewing i really like them . camera absolutely disappointing . i not taken first clear image . shutter top makes taking photo quite awkward someone small hands . i tried different cards , case write speed blurring image . no difference quality . i used prop snapped photo , image still unclear . played around settings still no good results . i would not recommend this camera all . help your decision , please view submitted photo . if your needs require better clarity than submitted photo , think again . this taken noon cloudy day . 3 megapixels . please identify bird inside airbrushed red circle . so , example : if you're searching ivory billed woodpecker , you'd better choose more wisely - cause there no way anyone cornell going accept this scientific proof . bird photo red bellied woodpecker , which approx . 9 " . i am 70 - 80 feet away . 66 ft minimum focal distance . hope this helps .	-1
my skill level : beginneri picked up latest canon zr800 local store tried some shooting it , since there no reviews latest model - but i totally disappointed quality - video granulation worst part - it motor noise which gets dubbed tape :( so i ordered this sony hc48 i am really really impressed performace , great video quality ( no granulation ) sound too . some you curious , it infrared light which great plus point shooting night time . infact , when i tried shooting dark nightshot plus turned i tried put my hand front infrared light , i could see patch light my hand , i really thrilled , seeing its actually light coming out camera . ofcourse you probably need use tripod shoot night light better stability . also , it various other features/modes i didnt notice canon . instance , it color mode bring out colors more effectively low light , shooting mode capture minute objects like insects etc .. i am glad i returned canon zr800 bought this	1
we got this printer dock bundle easy share camera ( c643)earlier this year . this our first experience printer dock we've happy it . it super easy print high-quality pictures right here home . we've since added easy share camera ( z612 ) our household used dock print both cameras . it easy switch one camera other - just remove plastic " foot " camera snap other one dock . we've not used wifi option , nor printer dock connected our computer , so i can't comment those particular options . we've noticed one little glitch dock - every once awhile , it seems not recognize camera . example , if camera off dock it put back , dock doesn't " power " camera . we've fixed this unplugging dock few seconds , then plugging it back . when it plugged back , it'll go through its start-up works fine . this certainly not everyday occurance - i'd venture it happens maybe once month or less . even though it bit annoying , it doesn't really decrease our overall opinion printer dock	1
more than satify this product , easy use excellent results . photoes sharp excellent colour reproduction , highly recomended any one who owns kodak camera or any other camera , must . thanks kodak	1
echoing what most others said , this great camera . it dream use , pictures stunning . since it based minolta design , it accepts lenses my old minolta maxxum 9000 ( circa mid 1980s ) . this huge benefit me ; i now excellent quality 70-210mm zoom lens my new alpha-100 no additional cost ! auto-focus ttl metering work properly , since anti-shake hardware camera body , works old lens also . even my old minolta cable release ( switch end electrical cable proprietary rectangular plug ) connects works fine . i'm very happy camera . said , there couple annoyances . one them might significant you , depending how you want use camera . first , noise . not picture noise , grainy low-light photos , but acoustic noise . shutter mechanism * loud * , much louder than my old maxxum 9000 . if you want unnoticed photographer taking discreet pictures like cartier-bresson his leica , this isn't your camera . second , lens shade . this nit , but i find it more clumsy use than lens shade old camera . old one held spring clasp ; you just squeeze opposite sides install or remove it , or reverse it storage . new one positioned precisely so tabs lock into place when it turned . not quick or easy use , but not really big deal . i suppose it saved couple dollars , new one one piece plastic while old one several parts . whole , excellent product . i'd buy it again heartbeat	1
i checked lot camera reviews many sources it hard find anything better than dvc-30 making documentaries , shorts , sketches , interviews . i tape lot live performances well , after i figured out how simple it adjust colors settings , it puts out great picture . i friend consumer sony hd , he wants get this camera . only drawback : xlr adapter around $200 bucks , but if you need super high quality sound , it worth it . i shot short horror film right out box , it came out amazing true black white infared . i love this camera	1
this superior camera money . simple operation well constructed . it " well built feel " it fits well your hand . detail image awesome , better than i hoped . i'm very impressed 16x zoom , very nice clean image . don't fooled size this camera , quality image beautiful . lot camera little package . it 4 built shooting settings different situations . it low level light option decent job capturing scene after dark . i gave it 4 stars because i didn't like manual it came manual controlling iris focus could made easier access use . built microphone not really pick up desired audio well . i recommend picking up external boom microphone or lapel mic system supercede built mic depending your application . if you need firewire cable download video your computer make sure you pick one those up well . camera firewire port 4pin firewire connector	1
i picked this camera up amazing 150 dollars sam club ! i originally going buy canon powershot a630 but didn't want pay 100 dollars more . this camera takes awesome pictures great movie mode . i don't know much photography jargon , but i know you adjust white balance , iso shutter speed manual mode . some shots come out blurry but most look great i'm sure look better 3x5 photo . i blown away macro mode , i submitted macro my eye . photo viewer here amazon doesn't picture justice ... when i view it my computer it just breathtaking how detailed it . my old cam 2.3 megapixel i could only take 16 pics internal memory , fuji f10 my 1gb olympus xd card , i take 341 fine-quality 6mp pics . i love this camera	1
i recently purchased f10 my local walmart clearance . i would recommend f10 anyone seeking easy point shoot camera good battery life . i tried f10 after purchasing 2 other digital camera . f10 comes 16mb xd memory card approprate cables . battery built but exceptional life . i initally concerned only one battery , but performance demonstrated there no need concern . terms picture performance camera number settings but takes excellent photos use auto focus setting . it also works well motion once you understand how use autofocus . pictures this camera much better than 8mp polaroid i using . i purchased 512 xd card this seems meet my needs terms storage capacity . overall this best camera i seen $200 . it rated 1 consumer reports last year . if you find one under $200 its well worth your money .	1
after much research i finally found binoculars fit my every need . price right , delivery right schedule , product excellent	1
this camera great ! not only it take great digital photos extremely user friendly , but if you add 1gb memory card it ( which slides right only costs $40.00 ) you take lot great quality digital videos sound very easy upload your computer and/or internet email family etc . fact , there no need buy video camera when you this it fits right your pocket . i take up 30 minute videos lots photos one time . you easily take photo while you making video well	1
i used camera three months , absolutely love it ! pictures crisp ( even very close-ups ) , video feature right up there . sound pick-up excellent . i created two dvd combining videos still pictures . folks thought quality very good . battery life rated very good , i found this true . i carry camera me nearly everywhere i go . people impressed size . drawbacks ? because its size , there no connections camera computer , tv or battery charger . docking station small lightweight . because battery life , i never away home long enough need recharging . i recommend camera without reservations , look first casio future	1
this really great camera ( it purpose ! ) this isn't camera get if you want super-fine shots or some kind amateur photographer . if you want camera preserve memories , snap shots during travel , parties , etc , this one get . here few my favorite things camera : solid construction . thing just reeks quality . very fast startup time - not only it easy fit pocket so you grab it while other idiots unzipping their camera bags , but it starts up so fast you're taking picture before you know it . portability - i've taken this everywhere . i've gotten great pictures i'd never gotten otherwise because this camera small , unobtrusive , always available , etc . i'm very happy this purchase my next digital camera ( sooner or later people laugh 5 megapixels ) definitely card/small sized casio	1
this post-christmas gift myself . i shopped around read many , many reviews . this my choice because it seemed offer best value my price range its 5 megapixels optical zoom . i bit surpised find it didn't come even small , cheap case keep it . so if you buy one , you'll need make sure you or get case it . i've just recently finally worn out batteries . it would nice guage screen tell me how low my power before it shut off . operation easy pictures come out nice clear . however , i found it usually works best without flash so i turn off . but if you use flash get red-eye , you remove picture right there camera which pretty neat . only things would made this better would battery guage , quicker shutter time case . but i'm giving it five stars because i feel i got more than my money worth here	1
it came before expected , nice , so nice , all new , working fine . ' i truly recommend beach camer	1
i sticked sony since i got my first digital camera 4 years ago sony camera moneys worth ! this one dsc-t10 one parent who carrying much already needs pack down change . it fits my purse still space more , only thing remember buy slim fitting case camera extra battery(for those kind battery not sold everywhere ) you need one when you don't thing you need extra battery , you always run out wrong time . i recommend this one	1
what purchase !! simple easy setup great christmas gift . now it holds our wedding photos proudly displayed living roo	1
late 1960 early 70 , i purchased nice 35mm slr lot accessories while navy . once i got back state re-entered college , i could not afford take develop all pictures anymore , so i sold all my equipment . recently i wanted get back into photography intrigued point shoot digital market . cost developing prints limited me my desire take lots pictures given subject . plus , i want more than just snap photos family ge t-t ogethers . digital cameras solve these problems finally grown up their ' toy-like ' beginnings . consumer reports rated this camera " best buy " advanced compact . all i say this camera " wow ! " addition " auto " point shoot , fujifilm finepix e900 modes natural light , portraits , sports , after dark , plus ' photo ' mode lets you change focusing method , photometric method , white balance , flash intensity . it also functions allow up 40 shots burst mode auto-bracketing shots changing exposure value ( ev ) your shots . you also work shutter speed , apperture setting or just everything manually . it also movies up 30 minutes long 1 gbyte xd photo card . what makes this advanced point shoot great . i experiment subject take hundred shots just see how camera responds then keep all , some , or none pictures i not spent cent photo-finishing . 3 weeks , i taken over 1,100 shots while trying learn basics operation . it very easy camera use . it forgiving auto mode most other modes also . if you want camera more than point shoot , then e900 good camera consider . sucking pictures off camera into ' my pictures ' folder your pc simple plugging camera into usb port clicking ok . software included camera basic editing . word warning , however , buy large xd memory card when you buy camera . camera shipps 16 mb xd-picture card holds three 9-megapixal pictures ! 1.0 gb xd holds 200 shots , while 2.0 gbyte xd hold 400 shots . you , course , crank quality down little 2-megapixals . also buy rechargable ' aa ' batteries . e900 accept regular ' aa ' batteries , but life two standard alkaline batteries 20 shots compared 160 rechargable ones . i am still learning bells whistles , but thus far , i like what camera how it it	1
i'd assumed e900 would slight improvement over e600 , very least pulling even . i surprised how much improved e900 over e600 , camera i've very satisfied . performance : point shoot capability much improved , especially low light conditions ; less sensitive shake , remarkable improvement movie mode sharpness low light . convenience : tether outlet cover ; no longer go through menu multiple shot preview , display " sticky " . nit-picks : i/o ports reordered , causing initial confusion a/v power ports , a/v power ports use same connector , case marginally cheaper maybe less robust than e600	1
this camera deserves 5 stars if you need camera easily fits your pocket or purse ready use whenever picture or movie moment arrives , even under water . considering varied picture taking situations , action , lighting conditions , performance beyond my expectations . only significant limitation seeing display bright sunlight or under water , even when screen set its brightest . however , aiming intuitive enough i never missed shot i able change modes even under water ( but i practice switching underwater wide 2 movie ahead time ) . one feature would improvement would ability zoom while taking movie . i received this camera just couple days before leaving cruise so i didn't any time practice it . careful not your finger front lens , especially under water where you may not watching screen . also aware when you zoom movies image movement also magnified . wide angle underwater movies much better than full optical zoom ( digital zoom off ) . after couple days controls easy use change modes review pictures movies . i used 1 gig cards highest resolution which provided 240 pictures or 40 minutes movies . switching back forth easy . movie recording continue until card full or battery runs out , not just short clips . my clips too short until i comfortable i would not quickly fill up memory card or run out battery . under water pictures superb natural shift color toward green . i recharged battery every other night . battery able take 100 pictures 15 minutes movie recharges . i recommend spare battery it indicate it getting low couple times ran out once . camera also used daylight , inside , without flash , even night shots ( auto setting better than night scene harbor lights night . camera steadied railing ) . i purchased lanyard metal clasp sports authority dollar which provides very secure leash . lanyard around my neck i could tuck camera my shirt pocket . i always ready next picture opportunity without worrying dropping it . i'm very pleased picture quality although it may not match camera much larger lens system , but it great able take pictures movies when i would not my larger camera available . 15 fps movies not match 3ccd digital video camera , but they acceptable . i even recorded short clips during live theater performances ( screen brightness set its minimum ) i pleased quality this tiny camera .	1
i use this case carrying ps digital camera accessories . case well-designed crafted . padding provides ample protection contents . movable divider padded makes case versatile . lowepro products deliver excellent value money . highly recommended	1
real high quality bag very low price . well padded perfect today small camcorders . enough room necessary accessories(eg . batteries , mini dv tapes , cables , mmc/sd card ) . good enough fit my elura 100 my canon sd700 fitted inside canon psc-55 deluxe leather cas	1
unlike one other wireless mic , i used , this one never yet picked up fluorescent light noise . battery economy this mic . quite good . transmitter receiver each use one size aa penlight cell , which seems last least 10 hours . i suspect this microphone sometimes picks up cell phone interference cell phones room , since i don't know what else would cause rare rat-a-ta t-t noise receiver picks up . best advantage this microphone there seldom any dead spots room where receiver gets weak signal	1
$15.95 kodak site . strange ! cable usb kodak 4 pin usb not firewire some folk tried say . typical cost video/audio $4 , kodak usb kodak/usb/b4 $9 ( oem ) $14 ( radio shack ) $19 ( kodak ) respectively so should considered even if you just want new cable . oh dock connector changer works great ! use it work my report shots . doesn't care if you use kodak easyshare software or xp pro camera wizard . just works	1
i this more than month now . installed 256 mb sd card , currently loaded 800 photos , configured my albums based trips occasions . i set photo frame slide show mode daily auto off settings . 1 week ago , i bought product , pandigital ( 7 ) w/ 128 mb built memory . philips far better picture display where pandigital acceptable photo display . when you look closely or stare photos , you immediately see philips not any grainy reproduction . it also elegant slide show transitions ; pandigital needs work their transitions . you just patient when transferring files your pc photo frame , i find myself hitting reset button more than i really would prefer . i find this no harm my pictures . this resolved just your pictures displayed straight or transferred your card . i just chose pc method because easier management what i needed transferred .	1
this good product . i like way it automatically resizes pictures fit full screen . image quality excellent . it like always looking your photo album . one complaint - colored trim rings magnetic don't line up perfectly due magnetism .	1
we ordered this product retirment present co-worker who leaving week so we even fed ex shipping . product kept showing up order status never updated until almost week later when it delivered . product arrived excellent condition but we wondering if it ever shipped ... amazon or retailer needs update shipping info instead leaving product showing order status not shipped	1
i leaving college this fall wanted little something easy handle send home videos , or post them . it works great ! i am especially excited compiling them onto dvd my laptop dvd burner . it so tiny it fits my pocket it very good batteries , you need buy scan disk ( i suggest 512 mb or 1 gig ) but it still turns out cheaper than regular clunky sized video camera . course it isn't amazing quality but it small enough take anywhere capture every anything . great deal money	1
good product , like price . this much less expensive than current pinseeker 1500 models , i bought it ebay used $150 so you may able find it less ( look under hunting golf rangefinders this model ) . this not pinseeker feature newer models but normal mode scan mode work perfectly ranging flags no reflectors ( although you may need try more than one time relatively stable hands ) . i able range flag 270 yards , able range top telephone pole 375 yards ( but it windy so flag straight out little cloudy ) . i would estimate this work ranging flags calm sunny day ( these don't work well sunny day because laser used visible light laser gets little interference sunlight ) 215-230 yards flag ( which what i need it ) . less expensive alternative than pinseeker , i really like performance , very impressed .	1
i am female bowhunter who really trouble judjing distances green fields . this great product . it easy use very accurate	1
i am extremely pleased this flash . olympus well ahead curve digital camera , lens flash integration . fl-36 achieve beautiful photographs appear taken natural light . i am just beginning discover its capabilities . you spend some time manual fully utilize its features . before purchasing , i read complaints fact it utilzes only two aa battries short battery life . i haven't found this much problem , using 2400 mah ni-mh batteries . they're cheap , easy carry recharged quickly fast-charger . it not cheap or disappointing . i highly recommend	1
my evolt 500 , i found automatic flash came camera would often give blue hue photos when flash came into use . finally photos bright no longer blueish hue . one thing isn't mentioned other reviews no battery comes this camera . make sure you order battery so you use this flash right away .	1
this set binoculars performs it said it would , fantastic purchase price	1
i bought few binoculars past couple years . satisfied only couple . these binoculars i am very pleased . clarity very good price terrific . i wasted alot money some not so good bushnell binoculars . but this pair pleasant surprise	1
so far i've this camera week im am pleased everything . its actually my 10th digital camera i think i've finally found one i like . it takes beautiful pictures , film good movies it also great sound . its also smaller than any other camera i've bought better looking . i think it takes pictures better night though sometimes good thing . buy it cause its very nice !!	1

controls this camera not hard figure out . it fun haveall little things you pictures 12 almost 13 , photogerphy somthing i love this camera . if you think thiscamera complicated , well you didnt read instruction guide very well	1
i great dslr i use " real " photography , but there times you just want throw camera your pocket go . samsung digimax great . 5 mp it great family ge t-t ogethers , business travel , kids playing , pets pets , etc . i'm not thrilled it didn't come case . it would nice just little pouch - even if it adds couple bucks price . perhaps i'm spoiled my " good " camera , zoom leaves little desired clarity department . transferring your computer super easy . i didn't even install software came it any my machines . i bought one my mother law well , so i recommend this camera non-tech savvy person . she able use it no issue . i'd also recommend it second camera	1
it ac adapter . one end plugs into wall , other end plugs into camera . it pretty hard screw up	1
camera works great , especially under water case it . i love item , it fits very nicely pocket going out camera get pictures too	1
-this camara picture quality nice , depend user purpose . my gf kinda satify it . -function easy use . -battery life so so . -battery charger design not convenience . you put battery into batter charger . recommand get cradle charger , but extra cost . it should sell cradle charger .	1
i bought this item whim before trip europe case we wanted take some pictures us trip . it turned out one best ideas i trip . it small , so it easily carried around bag or even your pocket light so you don't even notice it . when it proved immensely valuable taking picture low light situations . i tendency shake bit , so i get blurry pictures quite often . long exposure times low light situations compound problem even further . many old churches few museums they allow pictures , but no flash ( flash ruins art ) . i able get some great pictures because i able set up tiny tripod allow camera sit perfectly still 2 4 seconds exposure finish . it also took some great pictures night dimly lit monuments again ability aim hold perfectly still those couple seconds key great pictures .	1
great addition my sony v1 . very sturdy . well built . looks great . it comes carrying case soft towel wipe it down . overall good	1
it possible love inanimate object ? because i am !!! i love wide angle lens this camera , it just makes pictures look more professional whether your doing landscapes portraits or just night out bar . i'm not big fan their red eye technology , but rest makes up it . you use fish eye lens , sepia aged look , or spotlight . it also enhances your pictures perfect touch , if you so choose , your pictures become more vibrant ( helpful if they taken dark setting . plus you 26 different portrait settings choose ( landscape , action , night , portrait .... ) it great buy me . it very sleek easily fits pocket	1
there lot canon lovers who like post negative reviews other camera brands . well , this camera unique feature other brands don't -- in-camera stitching up three wide angle shots so you get great superwide panoramic shot right out camera . no computer needed . yes , you save shots individually if you want stitch them computer . just save three individual 23 mm shots -- it not rocket science . comments camera lacks raw silly -- this not big , bulky dslr or really sophisticated camera lots manual controls -- sorry , but not target this camera -- it pocket camera takes easy , wide angle shots panoramics . raw people who want fine tune pictures their computers . so , sum , this great camera shooting scenery when indoors , getting all folks picture without back up far away . i highly recommend it ! ( kodak colors wonderful !	1
i bought this case my new kodak digital z700 camera . it perfect fit . prior purchasing case , i read several reviews . many slightly negative , saying camera didn't fit properly case . few people said they're glad they didn't listen other reviews because case perfect fit them . i'm latter category . this case perfect size me ... way z700 fits it , ease carrying it around	1
i used this lens year both film digital . general , it decent lens price . even though it ed ( extralow dispersion ) , i get purple fringing high-contrast subjects long ( telephoto ) zoom . since i wild bird photography , this would show up purplish bird beaks twigs against bright sky . annoying . other hand , it produced some excellent portraits even wildlife photos where contrast wasn't excessive . doing side-by-side test w/ help camera store d70 , i compared this lens both 80-400/ 5.6 vr ( nikon ) tamron 200-500/ 6.3 . all three " good " , but nikon vr sharpest ( tamron roughly similar ed ) , also lost least contrast ( tamron somewhere middle , ed worst ) , ed tamron lenses both appeared kill color very slightly ( not big deal ) . only ed showed purple fringe w/ high contrast . but although 70-300 ed wasn't stellar these tests , i still prefer it backpacking due low weight size ( robustness ) , i rely 80-400 vr serious wildlife photography where i tolerate weight/size exchange image stabilization sharp optics .	1
one thing otherwise excellent stock lens comes d70 package telephoto not really very telephoto . 70 mm you just life size so you don't get much pull distance , if you're taking people pictures , you want something enhance faces more , give you more flexibility when shooting things farther away . this your lens . picture quality excellent it picks up where stock lens leaves off , so combination two lenses , you're going 18mm 300mm . picture quality excellent , what you'd expect nikon lens this price range . cons : it large heavier lens , it funny hood over front it , which i haven't able divine purpose , but it not obnoxious , f/4- 5.6 , you really need good quantity light it . but if you're looking lens give you magnification you find missing stock lens , then this it . price very good quality you're getting	1
just aware maginfication such it takes very steady hands , especially distance viewing . sure , you bring it ball game count players ' nose hairs , but field vision better suited fixed sky objects , long-distance spotting , or ( fairly motionless ) birds . tripod strongly recommended	1
i purchased these binoculars night sky viewing . i pair 10x50 bushnell binoculars i impressed what i able see through those so i bought these even more depth viewing they not let me down . they ideal supplements telescope or if you don't telescope , these great your first introduction optics open up night sky you . they much easier use than telescope you see all kinds neat things . i viewed such things orion nebula , andromeda galaxy , pleiades , double stars such mizar alcor ursa major relative ease they looked stunning . focus these binoculars milky way you tons stars you wouldn't able see otherwise . i even able look saturn some steadying binoculars against my chest , could slightly make out definition rings . these binoculars also magnificent job viewing moon . i read some reviews they really heavy bulky , but i found they surprisingly light easy steady free handed . they quite large , which means they take up more space than normal binocular , but this expected . mine come carrying case tripod adapter ( which i haven't used yet , so i cannot comment its quality ) . overall , price , you can't go wrong . i've used these binoculars daytime they great -- crystal clear optics . they also seem very durable some care , probably last you many many years . if you new stargazing considering good pair binoculars show you all kinds wonderous things , look no further than celestron skymasters -- you not disappointed .	1

i kodak easy share 7300 , which i loved , but pieces battery compartment broke off it wouldnt stay closed , so i buy new one . i spent few days researching cameras within my budget , my mom hp she liked it , so i decided try it . i love it . its so simple use , software easy install easy use once you try transfer your pics camera computer . i not yet tried print pic , but everything else camera wonderful . its small fits your hand , zoom decent , picture quality changes when you use max zoom , but pics still come out pretty good . only feature i dont like much when you looking through lcd display , when you move camera , its little blurry doesnt focus right away . everything else wonderful i am very very happy my camera	1
this my first slr camera . i'm pleased i choose sony a100 digital slr camera . i purchased sony 75-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 compace super telephoto zoom lens it . i've taken wild life , landscapes , luna , celestial pictures . i amazed sharpness photos . i would recommend it friend .	1
there isn't much more say here . this superb little camera , definately worth 10 cnet , not 7.0 their review gave it ! they completely got it wrong their rating because this camera definitely deserves least 8.0 ! here , it also gets my 5 stars ! far pros go this camera ( 28mm wide angle , 10x optical zoom , 3 '' lcd , , built-in lens cover ) , it exactly good it sounds ! real life needs real life situations real people loves superb photos right camera capture those moments . cons side ( no manual controls , no zoom video mode , average battery life ) , those practically only things more advanced user would care . manual controls mostly expert photographers white balance exposure settings already this camera , so i don't know what else you need . zooming video mode isn't important me since i don't particularly take much video footage . i only say average battery life because i tend look through photos i already shot pretty often without using power save lcd , therefore , that particularly what drains battery . however , you usually get @ 250-270 shots per charge , without frequent previewing . panasonic basically taken original tz1 made it even better . there not much missing this camera . i've said , 28mm wide angle leica lens , 10x optical zoom , 3 " high resolution screen , excellent image stabilization , etc . all this fairly compact camera . panasonic also improved " noise " higher iso . low light performance much better than previous panasonic models . most important this , camera takes fantastic pictures . thing i'm extremely impressed construction finish alone . just holding it your hands it screams quality feels like tank . i love it . it seriously feels like $700 camera . no exaggeration . i little worried it not able fit my jean pockets before buying it . women may issues really tight jeans but us guys no problem . it fits fine . i seriously can't believe i carry around camera 10x zoom inside my jean pockets . truly remarkable . 3 " screen amazing . you practically enjoy your pics right screen without even printing them high resolution output . image quality great , if you need extra sharpness want " canon-like look , " you could always use camera " vivid mode . " it also not much bigger or heavier than your overpriced sony . plus , here , i found it three hundred , high speed 1gb panasonic card included . what better than ?! only accessory i buy now just dmw-ct3-k , leather case specifically this camera . you really can't find perfect digital camera , but this comes close you get . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you looking great zoom camera small enough form factor , you should seriously consider dmc-tz3 . this best compact camera i've ever owned	1
upgrading tz3 4yr old canon 3.2 megapixel . waited few months purchase when i heard tz1 updated . tz3 , panasonic fixed main complaints tz1 which : no build lens cover , noisy images higher iso speeds . imo , build lens cover alone wirth price permium over tz1 . others said , this camera great build quality , easy operation , high-quality look . i ordered black model pleasantly surprised when i opened box . it look retro 35mm cartridge camera , which cool . chrome ( or polished stainless steel , cant tell ) , first rate looks great matte black case . lcd huge bright . camera " simple mode " great job other modes fully customizable . zoom fantastic , but you need really steady hand full zoom , even optical stabilization turned . i take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way my car i came across herd deer . shot shot speed really great , unless you using flash . red-eye reduction works better than any other digital camera i used . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you looking great zoom camera small form factor , you should seriously consider dmc-tz3	1
i just received dmc-tz3a . i love this camera . this my first camera ever . i love features , build quality , menu system . i am still getting used learning how take quality pictures . example , i trouble getting it focus times . i am certain this just learning curve me . one feature i am disappointed it lacks - auto retraction lens when playback mode . most other cameras automatically retract lens protect it when viewing pictures camera . this one not this you turn camera off get it retract . i really wish they would update firmware support this important safety feature . all-in-all i definitely recommend this camera	1
i bought it go snorkeling , but after few days realize it very useful rainny days well protect camera . very very useful	1
usual , sony very good job case . last year i losted similar camera ( t33 ) skiing whistler because i didn't sport pack like this one . whole package stills very compact yet . very good stuff	1
this really nice point-and-shoot camera . outdoor pics really impressible clarity also quite good . only big problem i noticed this piece its night shot mode . since it not any outside flash , night pics not good expected sony . indoor pics also affected same problem	1
if you're looking style , size , picture quality easy use , then this sony camera one you ... this my first ever digital camera i must say sony never fails dissappoint me . only reason they didn't receive 5 out 5 stars because i sliver model i really wanted black model .. but it wasn't available	1
i love this camera ! it light easy carry , low cost takes great pictures . though i heard others say it battery eater , i able take over 100 pictures without needed recharge . picture quality awesome , even when printed 8x10 . especially such low price i very very impressed . i would most deffinetly recommend this camera those looking great everydaa use camera , great price	1
received item pictured no defects noted	1
not buy this camera $899 listed above seller ( maybe amazon might correct price after reading my review ) . it priced $299 or lower many online physical stores	1
digital camera owners product very susceptible obscuring dirt , dust , grime coating not only lenses but picture composition veiwing area rear camera . mavicas also more moving parts than stick storage ulilized others . this product greatly reduces cameras exposure these environmental threats . it thoughtfully equipped storage areas bungi straps . it very well made . it classic example form following function	1
it pretty good camera . its my first camcorder , i bought it because i baby october need capture everything , my nikon digital wasn't doing it me . optical zoom great , its pretty easy use , i love you just press finalize button wait little bit then play dvd dvd player . only negative thing price , it bit high , im not sure if its much better than other ones out there lower prices	1

i researched both pv-gs500 pv-gs300 . they same exact picture quality . these best quality camcorders you buy if you average consumer . if you amateur or aspiring filmmaker you need go higher end cameras . not even sony hd touch image picture quality these panasonics because it only 1ccd . 3ccd what pro models this gives you color rich professional looking picture . yes hd camcorders more lines resolution , but without richness color quality 3ccd , picture doesn't look good . pv-gs500 or gs300 can't beat any other camcorder it price range . drawback going hd or hard drive based camcorder you very limited when it comes editing . most editing software aren't even compatible hd yet . most importantly , if picture quality most important you , there no reason spend extra $500 pv-gs500 , just buy gs300 since they both 3ccd . paying more only gets you 12x zoom instead 10x , 4.0 mp instead 3.1 mp . $500 i live without extra 2x zoom 1 mp . i'm not buying camcorder taking still pictures anyway . also gs300 only 2.7 lbs which important taking handheld shots . gs500 4 lbs which drawback compared gs300 . if your filmming your kids soccer game handheld hour that big difference ! bottomline , panasonic needs come up more important features put into gs500 make it worth extra $500 . it just isn't!!!so that why i give th gs500 only 4 stars , gs300 5 stars .	1
great camcorder , excellent lens , image stability functions ... all package very functional ergonomical . zoom amazing . great outdoors recordings .	1
this battery pack , i make more pictures then before without changing batteries . i also better grip while taking pictures	1
i bought this my first digital camera . picture quality decent , there lot settings user tinker around ( though i haven't really much use them ... yet . ) my only problem this camera it eats batteries like candy . i recommend buying least 2 pairs rechargeable batteries , well fast recharger if you're type takes lot pictures . alleviate this problem , you option turning off viewing screen , which help conserve battery life	1
i found this great camera , not just it price . it simpl eto figure out how use , multiple settings cover any occasion picture takeing . i love it runs aa batteries . i bought cheap compact battery charger coming four rechargable batteries so all i keep both sets charged my camera case ( i don't keep batteries camera keep both safe leaving batteries there takes some their charge ) so wheni want 2 use my camera i put one set if set runs out ( but set lasts good long while ) i other set my disposal start chargeing dead batteries 1st outlet . this solved any problems might happened short battery life me . only other problem delay when you push button actual picture takeing . however this delay it focuses picture you so ur shots almost always turn out well focused , opposed friends camera who not delay but it takes many more tries get focused one . i love this camera recomend it anyone , especially first time digital camera users	1
perfect size well made . makes it easy compact carry camera battery extra memory	1

good product , it year now . wish i bought one jack external microphone . consider if you buying camcorder used recording teachings or other educational event . it good sound pick up but not good enough proper recording teachings	1

i bit worried this camera after reading bunch complaints lens error some other issues . maybe those early versions or bad batch , maybe design got tweaked ?? but i no problems all . i just came back two weeks portugal shot over 1500 pictures four weeks or so i've using camera it bounced around bunch . i tried get lens error ( before i left after i found " fix " ) but it never happened . maybe if you actually stop lens moving or pushed it back ? but would probably break most cameras . so either issue fixed or some users violently rough camera get error . images look great , it fast it great	1
camera takes good photographs . my issue its recharging system . it purchased cradle cp fx-a10 , after 9 months battery would no longer charge fully . i discharged nickel hybride battery fully no success . i purchased new battery ... same problems . not buy cradle , it waste money . i now recharge aa batteries external charger	-1

great single sensor mini dv camcorder . same sensor image quality more expensive models . easy use . great first buy families who starting video . doesn't leds night shots , although most case it isn't major inconvenience . sound good . pros : 1 . low price ! 2 . intuitive enough beginners . 3 . large lcd . 4 . good picture quality . cons : 1 . no digitizer . meaning no video . model up it , although it costs little extra . that major draw back form me . ( thus 4 stars)2 . cannot confirm it'll reliable over time . bought it too recently	1
first one i got amazon wouldn't hold charge , but they sent replacement within couple days no hassle or grief ! yay amazon111the unit exactly what it supposed , so reasonable clarity . keep mind pictures relatively small , so closer you take picture better you able see it screen . make sure your focus money you not disappointed . great way show off children grandchildren	1

i purchased this bag carry my hp photosmart digital camera photo printer , 100pk 4 " 6 " photo paper , power cord two chargers each hold 4 aa batteries , i still room left . i'm very pleased	1
i bought this battery back-up my canon sd630 . this camera no viewfinder so 3 " display always . there no problem using canon charger lenmar battery . i didn't time first charge , but i'd say it took hour . over next three days , i took 162 pictures 7 minutes video out recharging . half those pictures indoors flash turn . only reason i didn't give this battery " five stars " i can't yet speak battery longevity i only it few weeks yet . i'm very happy this battery . save few bucks buy this one instaed canon nb-4l .	1
bought these amazon only $7.99 . i bought two both equally good . i got 320 pictures 10 short videos one charge these batteries , which more than one came my canon sd630 . i only got 210 original so when i got 330 out this battery i estatic . only $8 what deal ! esp . when canon $50 . i got two these so i enough battery power over 800 photos before i need charge . don't know longitivity these batteries but even if they don't last long canon , i'm completely satisfied	1
battery this size , price great . i applied amazon credit card got $30.00 off which made price even better . battery works great so far	1
good news i got what i wanted this battery . i go all-day outings zoo , amusement park , or any place far ac outlet , just keep my camcorder turned without worrying running out juice . or , i use my camcorder battery power several days running without recharge battery . furthermore , battery level indicator back neat extra added attraction lets me see how much juice i left without use any process . however , this extra security comes price -- i don't just mean dollars cents . granted , none drawbacks i'm discuss actual show-stoppers ( come think it , dead battery literally would show-stopper , wouldn't it ? ) , but they're worth thinking if you want buy yourself some additional battery time you're trying decide whether buy it form this high-capacity battery or several lower-capacity batteries . first problem admittedly least important because you get around it simply either planning ahead or buying one those separate battery chargers job faster than camera itself . but if you rely camera recharge your battery , this baby takes long time go fully drained fully charged . no big deal if you remember start it charging night before day you need it , but if you forget , you can't start it before breakfast expect full charge time you've finished your eggsbut there one other reason why this lesser worry . unlike some other rechargeable batteries * , np-qm91d ** recharged before it fully drained no resulting loss capacity . my understanding if you try this some batteries , amount charge they hold point becomes maximum amount they ever hold again . example , if said battery originally capacity six hours you recharged it after using up only four , battery could then take only four hours worth charge , so would would only hold four-hour charge point . because np-qm91d ** recharged any time , you never let it fully drain once you've charged it , thus never long wait it fully charge after you've it once .. more significant drawbacks me come this battery increased weight size ... np-qm91d increased weight doesn't make camcorder uncomfortably heavy any means , but it shift its center gravity significantly , which took some getting used . but larger size np-qm91d , its resultant shape , what really causing me trouble . lower capacity batteries , such np-fm50 i'd using , slide nicely down into recessed area back camera , held snugly place until you release them because their back surface flush back camcorder . this higher capacity battery fits into same recessed area , but protrudes beyond back camcorder . yes , viewfinder extended accommodate this , i usually use lcd screen side camera anyway -- which i now much more readily afford because i don't need worry so much extra drain battery . but protruding battery it makes much harder connect ac power adaptor . more importantly , battery isn't held place nearly securely , because it long , heavy rectangle that gripped only one end . i've actually it come loose fall off back camera several times . one these occasions , meant i missed shot i wanted get because i reattaching battery . however , i admit this probably wouldn't happened if camera mounted tripod . so maybe real problem this battery intended professional videographers , i definitely ain't one . if you definitely ain't one either , you might want hesitate before buying this battery -- although , i said start , it helpful , despite problems . * such one my cell phone or my cordless razor . ** all sony camcorder batteries , most other camcorder batteries nowadays , i understand it	1
what it supposed . i use it sony dsc-v1 , no problems	1
nice zoom record button separate camera . tried using remote , but it zoom goes too fast looks jerky . only wish zoom button variable control like camera	1
i admit i am novice most part when it comes cameras , but this something everyone should ; mainly case but also extra battery . i climbing wall florence get picture dropped my sony dsc-200 ( while it carrying case ) 15 feet up it came through without scratch . even if you always carrying it around purse or bag , padding around carrying case great prevent scratches or damage . i know you get carrying cases less but extra battery great addition anyone who taking it vacation or worried running out battery power worth spending extra money .	1
price i paid amazon amazing . battery alone through sony style whould cost me 10 bucks more . case i got i gave friend mine cuz i ot my self aluminum case looks better takes duo cards , pouch i honestly say ok but i'm not using it i'll go friend mine . lives me battery which i constantly use rotate one came camera	1
i great experience . service pricing excellent . seller provided exactly what when . i would buy them again without reservation	1
really like camera . just little hard download . my brother-in-law bought one after using mine . but he got download kit sony recording videos(about $200 ) . money well spent . ok pictures , great video recording . best part , it 2 1 fits regular digital camera case ! zoom awesome this camera ! 30gb hard drive records forever	1
front compartment plenty room sd cards , batteries , other small accessories . my kodak dx7440 fits great middle , my phone fits it too . i spend alot time zoo , park ... go my 2 1/2 year old , so i just slip my id , money , credit cards whatever there too , it became my new little purse it not my shoulder , it right there my belt loop	1
this great purchase my purposes - birding wildlifing . i get used turning center-focus ring finger , zoom lever index-finger position . use full zoom , you really need total stability , but half zoom very useful even moving kayak . right-eye focus ring right up against eyecups hard move unless you twist open eyecups , which case focus ring fine . focus crispness not quite what i hoped full zoom , but still good seeing field marks . one big advantage light weight . this set light smaller nikon i lost . very nice	1
binoculars past either way too expensive or too cheap , i wanted new pair would replace pair loaned out , then lost . opportunity presented itself form trip canada this past september , which required something would able capture canadian rocky vistas , but also not so heavy i would feel like needing cart stow them . nikon eagleview binoculars seem fill bill ( not too expensive , but also not too heavy ) . they great zoom feature easily changed well able easily focus one hand . my only complaint while zooming subject , light level reduced , which occurs naturally due nature optics . you can't everything , but these just right , allowing my wife i use them time time again while observing nature . summary , good pair all-around use !	1
i looking case my canon digital glad finally find one amazon.com . case perfect ! not only it protect my camera but beautiful . red leather case gets lots compliments --- plus it matches my luggage ! thanks amazon	1
i am thrilled this beautiful red leather camera case . it fits my sd600 perfectly . just like camera , case stylish , elegant functional . leather rich red , it very well made . ( matches my coach red leather wallet wonderfully ! ) case features tiny pocket could hold extra battery , belt loop back , matching red leather wrist strap . case closes magnetic snap it features metal canon logo closure flap . great case wonderful camera . i couldn't more pleased	1
this case awesome . not bulky all nice shade red . not too bright , but not dark so it looks feminine . i love it . one small complaint - it little tight my sd630 . yes , i know it not advertised one , but it elph , so i thought it would fine . it fine , just little tight . it takes maybe two extra secs make sure case closes . i'm hoping case may stretch little use then it'll great . right now it tight fit , but it fits .	1
i quite few camcorders over years ( none them sony ) , when i looking new one , i my usual 3-4 weeks researching , etc . i chose sony dvd handycam because it easy use , menu pretty straightfoward , it 40x optical zoom ( compared 32x ) it dvd . i skeptical dvd part because i heard minimal recording time , etc but i didn't understand different disk formats i guess . anyway , i am very pleased this camcorder , able shoot 16:9 format also nice feature i didn't even think first . so , although i am new sony camcorders , i am really enjoying this one . my only advice would go ahead buy memory stick disk pack when you buy camera because you want them	1
i some research regarding this camcorder couple cannons . i picked this one because it usb port , 40x zoom , sold immediately when i tested it out local circuit city . touch screen easy navigate i use memmory stick my sony vaio laptop . only negative it not come any memory ; other than , it outstanding value . i highly recomend this product	1

i bought this camera my granson he alot fun learning alot how use it . i also saved 25% thru amazo	1
it works camera . this second lenmar battery i used . they not seem last long panasonic but good value	1
before i bought my fz20 i alot research not only what assecories get camera , but where buy them . read alot reviews . i ended up ordering1 . ) two equivalent panasonic cga-s002 camcorder/digital camera batteries ( same ones i'm doing review . ) i'll go concert , take hundred pics only go through one battery . panasonics offical battery costs around 40 something plus shipping handling if you order it online . i paid 50 altogether 2 batteries last just long panasonic ( actually bit longer then one they sent me camera . ) can't beat value . here what i also recommend : permaraal 72mm 62 mm adapter ($40 bucks ) 62mm filter uv filter your choice ($15- 30)(mainly protect lens , i keep it all time . ) 62mm filters don't affect picture or lighting quality , they're cheaper . plus you need least inch half long adapter so lens room move . 72mm one they send camera too long . also , get micro fiber cloth . i seriously recommend microtear . awesome brand . case , go tamrac , i got tamrac 5314 travel zoom 4 camera holster bag . fits perfectly even keeping 62mm adapter . when i want it off , i keep it bottom bag , no big deal . i got mine bhphotos 17 [ ... ] i suggest getting your camera butterfly photo , i got my fz20s 388 grand total 397.80 , no tax . if you get it best buy or circuit city expect end up paying around 550 . amazon ; 500 . look into getting tripod well , i can't stress how important they . if your not serious getting into photography i don't recommend fz20 . get cheap cannon dig ;) . or go compac series panasonic lumix brand . yah ones crappy lenes . hope this review helps	1
i used nikon 80-400mm lens my d200 first time last week my kids lacrosse game . before purchasing this lens , i little concerned some comments here autofocus slow react . i took 100 pics game , one slightly out focus . all other pics incredibly sharp . i think this great lens	1
bought safari africa large part based other amazon reviews - am very satisfied . contrary one these reviews i find lens quite light what it . only issue it really bit slow not ideal very low light situations . but it compact optics really great . highly recommended	1
only problem this video camera ( i mean only problem ) it wasn't color i expecting ( grey all over instead black accents ) . other than it amazing . granted , it doesn't take greatest quality video , nor it take night shots all , but if you're going buy video camera this price , you better not expect those things anyway . this camera perfect catching moments your life making fun little videos fun .	1
i like take pictures , my husband wanted camcorder , so when we saw this wal*mart under $100 we thought we'd give it try . i've using it my main camera little over year it isn't too bad just family photos . camcorder fun play , i sometimes use mp3 player . it worth money . however , eventually you going want better camera . indoor shots all come out slightly dark yellow . but don't expect get better camera this price . i am looking $300-500 quality i really want . i am trying decide if i give this camera my 8yo daughter when i am it . she budding photographer she enjoy taking videos , but honestly i think camera she now better quality than this one	1
it charges battery promised , quick efficient . it small easy hide . this makes it easy pack vacations adventures , however , it also makes it easy lose , which why i'm purchasing charger . go figure .	1
this order bit confusing . i tried repeatedly contact via email company shipping this item but they very slow responding my inquiry . turns out shipment already arrived but one my family members failed let me know it come where they put it . so , while it turned out there no problem shipping , or product , company slow respond my emails when i thought it not shipped . eventually after i sent 4 separate email inquiries i hear them they said it shipped i should received it . when i started questioning all 6 family members deliveries . i wrote company apologized letting them know i received it but never heard back them again	1

overall , this nice digital camcorder under $150 . my only complaint still images always look blurred when taken indoors . if you buying this taking still images , i suggest you buy different camera . i suggest you purchase sd card this camera , because 32 mb built-in memory just isn't enough fully enjoy this camcorder	1
i use this camcorder my own videography business never any complaints video quality . get better camcorder , you would literally pay twice much money . some people complained low light capabilities , my mind this one problem camera . you need find good camcorder light make up this problem . but images shot outdoors look similar quality my friend $2000 cannon camcorder ! if you're looking " pro-sumer " camcorder you're budget , or if you simply want top line regular camcorder , buy this camcorder	1
i quite bit research video cameras but i am no means expert . i selected this camera hopes image quality would lot better than my older jvc camera . although colors bit better , all you seem get 3ccd . i love small compact size well features ease operations . it bit uncomfortable hold my hand , it seems better suited someone smaller hands . i wish it built lamp low light	1
i actually originally went this page through google see if they still selling this model . i say this really good camera casual photography , even still good camera 4.1 megapixel camera ( considering you purchase 6 , 7 , even 8 megapixel cameras now ) . i bought this camera myself january 2005 , it reaching its two-year mark , still works close perfectly . it'd actually still working perfectly if i didn't accidentally drop it so many times hard surfaces ( more than three hard falls ! ) . my opinion , it takes great quality pictures , slightly above-average video if there good lighting , takes great pictures even without flash . it definitely better camera than my dad fujifilm 7 megapixel camera , too . i think my camera still year or two it , if i could less clumsy . i've also gotten lot comments photos i've taken . people said i really good camera , it takes excellent pictures . i used take lot pictures bands , they've always pleased them . it surprisingly well dim environments . lately , i've taking lot still life pictures fun , got lot good feedback quality this camera . there only one problem i this camera , however , it it eats up batteries really fast . i'm not exactly sure what considered good battery life digital camera , but i charge my batteries every day . overall , this really good camera me through concerts , parties , film shoots , landscapes , still lifes , amateur " artsy " photos . i'll incredibly sad when i part it	1
i bought this camera christmas 04 trip ireland . picture quality ease use great . battery life also very good . i took over 600 pictures my vacation almost every one turned out perfect . quality good enough flawless 8x10 print . i not any problems this camera . i also owned older model sony , nikon , kodak digital . this one my opinion best all them	1
this great camera if you're looking something basic . i bought it start videoing my baby , picture quality great . one thing though , this model doesn't " spot light " , so if you'll need extra lighting , upgrade sc-d363 model	1
this camera so much good looking you afford bad picture quality or bad power management . it not those who really concerned pixels zooms . it camera people go	1
it great when product just " works " . read manual get full benefit this great camera	1
you read reviews , saying lcd broke , other things just dont work . personally , i no problems whatsoever . yes i nice case padded we keep camera when we not using it , no i am not professional so i am not too incredibly pickey when it comes camera . quality great , eveyone enveys this camera who uses it . o also let me mention we this camera year now two kids handeling it times no regrets so far . pros : * small * sleek * exellent picture quality * great video playback * good in-camera photo catalog * durable ( this my experience .. remember 1 year 2 kids , good case . * good battery life cheap batteries , i bought 2 extra batteries like $20 ebay . * simple user interfacecons : * red eye could better this camera * get 7.1 mp version if you plan cropping pictures blowing them up large ( using picasa2 )	1
although i not used this tripod serious recording my old digital video camera , this tripod not difficult connect into my digital handycam . i tried it once after christmas it so easy . i should bought this long time ago . i got this tripod one my christmas presents .	1
this product deserves 5 star review . tripod itself very sturdy , supports wide range heights ( including its lowest height which works nicely macro shots ) , it light compact ( which makes it great travel ) . top off great price , you've got great tripod . here why i gave it 4 stars : product accessory list categorized incorrectly sony website . if you look up cybershot dsc-n2 , click it supported accessory list , vct-d680rm remote control tripod listed ( currently , writing this review ) . furthermore , if you open sony description vct-d680rm remote control tripod , it directly lists dsc-n2 compatible . note dsc-n2 only half compatible . it fit just fine tripod itself , but it not work remote control features . dsc-n2 doesn't acc jack , which necessary make use tripod remote control features digital camera . i've called up sony discussed problem , they agree product mislabeled . they've very helpful far customer service goes , considering fact i didn't purchase tripod directly them . they even offered full refund product directly them . hopefully they'll update their website soon so this doesn't confuse anyone else . this why i'm giving tripod 4 star review . tripod itself great , but documentation incorrect . note , this still excellent choice tripod . if you're willing spend more money , you upgrade vct-1500l tripod , which give you extra 2 inches high low end tripod , but i found vct-d680rm gives me plenty flexibility travel accessibility , saved me some money . even without use vct-d680rm remote control features , it still excellent tripod , especially amazon price	1
tripod well built . each leg 4 sections , not 3 . this tends help strength stability . controls handle make capturing video very easy . it not professional tripod built 40-pound cameras , but it very easily handle any sony consumer video camera . only minor drawback speed zoom through handle little tricky manage . however , if your tired cheesey cheap tripods sell $30-$40 , spend money this one . it well worth it	1
sony cybershot great camera . colors features amazing . very easy use . only thing i dont like camera zoom out button . if you zoomed you wont able zoom out .	1
sony w55 followup successful popular w50 . it very good compact camera , easy carry easy use , reasonably priced - so most people happy it . not much changed w50 , which this case good thing ! one change w55 7 mp camera , rather than w50 6mp . honestly , that not big plus , they haven't made sensor catches light any larger . same ( good ) lenses , same size sensor = same ( good ) pictures , but not better . ( though it might help little features like smart zoom . ) obvious change course colors . don't make too much fun ! there 4 dsc-w series cameras our family , colors would kept my mother-in-law taking my sister camera home her . little personalization good thing . internal memory expanded ( 56mb ) , but i've never used internal memory cameras it , so i'm not sure matters much . it might worth knowing how use backup , dozen or two shots if your card full , or you some other problem . controls , menus interface w55 reasonably easy use . example , w55 easy access various scene modes ( twilight , etc ) , some explanation screen what those mysterious little icons mean ( so you might actually use them , since it tells you what they ! ) . if you're new digital photography , there learning curve . but if you've used other cameras much , especially sonys , you pick this up use many features right away . read short introductory guide comes camera , though ! rechargeable battery should easily last you full day shooting - hundreds shots - no problem . ( little wise turning it off when you're not using it ! ) so you probably don't need second battery , unless you're going into woods while . it nice not mess bulky aa rechargeables . also , lithium ion batteries don't memory effect , so don't worry partial recharging . just charge battery each night . so - before getting second battery , try it while see if you need it . but get case - something protect screen , least . fully closed one might help resist rain splashes little , too . you'll also want get memory stick pro duo card - pro cards faster , you need smaller duo size this camera . get 1-2gb card so you don't think running out memory too much - if you shop carefully , you find them so little these days it well worth avoiding running out memory . you might want spare card if you plan travel more than week , or use video mode often - which surprisingly good ( though bit dark ) if set fine , but uses enormous amounts storage setting . you stretch your memory , your hard drive space , using one lower-resolution settings take snapshots . you don't really need 7mp all your photos ! w55 take better photos than those credit-card type cameras tiny lens system - optics always make difference camera . any reasonable person very happy pictures w55 , given size it . camera little slow often take disappointing pictures low light dark situations . try high iso mode low light no-flash situations - picture quality suffers some , but most people find it useful . realistically , no ultra-compact camera work really well situation - if you need often , think something bigger lens bigger sensor . good light always gives best pictures any camera . there limits what you currently expect any ultracompact camera . w55 offers enough controls ( through scene modes program mode ) allow fair amount control over pictures , automatic camera . charger fairly compact rated 100-240v , so while you'll need plug adapter overseas you won't need voltage converter . battery charger little slow , though probably ok . keep this camera charged handy , you'll find you take lot pictures because it easy carry easy use	1
i own various digital cameras , cheap point shoot pricey slr small camera , this one great . 10x optical zoom camera fits your pocket awesome . i took it wildlife sanctuary 10.3 meg slr , pictures this camera almost good those taken 300mm zoom slr ( least 4x6 8x10 , i didnt try anything bigger yet ) . easy navigate screens , loaded options . i would definitely buy it again . dont let other brands 3x 5x optical , plus digital zoom fool you . digital zoom degrading pixels . this one buy if you want camera fits your pocket zoom close .	1
this best digital camera i've owned . first , i believe camera should fit into my jeans pocket so it me when photo opportunities arise . it not smallest camera market any means , but it fits comfortable into my levis . i use this camera all time . second , zoom amazing . 10x optical zoom camera fits my pocket ! because camera built image stabilization , deeply zoomed pictures look terrific . third , my wife finds it easy use . this says lot . i'm techie , but she thinks dials menus intuitive easy / quick use . fourth , camera takes 16:9 aspect ratio movies ( or regular 4:3 if you prefer ) . image quality much better than i expected . image stabilizer probably helps improve quality , but i played videos our 42 " tv . quality appears just good our normal cable signal . definitely not hd , but good enough share short videos friends tv more than sufficient emails youtube postings . fifth , we very pleased image quality . because we amateurs , we take pictures under all sorts less than ideal conditions ( low light , moving subjects cameras , long zoom shots rocking boats , etc . ) . this camera sharpness , colors , details better than any other digital cameras we've owned over last ten years . pro might not satisfied , but we . sixth , it works great iphoto , mail , iweb , imovie our mac , so sending pictures or videos via email , making webpages them , or editing them into movies / slideshows very , very easy . battery life sufficient , but i would rather it took standard batteries ( aa or aaa ) so i wouldn't bring charger vacation . charger small , but takes valuable space tight suitcases . first , i not thrilled manual lens cap . however , i veiwed this camera store before buying amazon . salesperson convinced me integrated / automatic covers provide less protection likely places mechanical failure . big lens lets lumix pull such massive zoom definitely needs good protection .	1
bit more info program . it exist . it free . you send your camera or , if big city , take it repair center free replacement . it not matter if your camera out warranty . replacement program exists other countries well ( least uk canada ) . jvc standing behind their product you really respect them .

what i've read some reviewers i might not bought jvc . now i'm glad i . taking time learn pros cons various menu settings allowed me avoid all pitfalls they encountered , especially low light shooting . if you shoot electrically lit areas , not use nightshot or auto-a menu settings if camera or subject might move . use agc setting . autofocus image stabilization only work well dim lighting using auto mode , not manual . color balance videos outdoors slightly toward " cool " end spectrum , but made perfect doing manual white balance ( carry pure white card set it ) . i not encountered any unsurmountable problem yet . only negatives so far ( 7 months use ) addition what i said above : if you power camera it high zoom setting last time , autofocus problems until you zoom out ; front led light little use , it creates keychain flashlight type illumination , bright center dim around edges ; wide squeeze mode 16:9 only good if you never want make copy 4:3 tv . best points : excellent color quality outdoors acceptable indoors reasonable illumination manual white balance , small easy carry , battery charges quickly it life ok i don't use lcd much or leave camera scenes ; good optical zoom range but you might need wide angle converter cramped spaces ; sound quality adequate unless you're recording musical instruments want precise accuracy . suggestions : buy 30.5 -37mm step-up ring , uv filter proper lens hood . it fits snugly roots n5 bag ( belt , hand , shoulder straps ) , available photo stores , leaving room extra tape ( or two or extra small battery ) , a/c adapter white balance card	1

this little unit take anywhere camera job just anything . kids easily use it , back screen large enough you really see what you shooting without squint . menu structure basic but adequate . i seen this unit priced alot more other places high reputation but once again amazon its other retailers come up goods . thanks	1
price , you really get lot neat features : mp3 playback , short video , decent pictures , use sd cards , rechargeable battery , so . regrettably , quality hardware leaves lot desired . buttons flimsy scream " fragile ! " i've exchange my device twice , each worked less than 2 months before failing . i not know if there quality control problem : some units work described whereas others simply fail , or if there quality issues across board . either way , you may want consider spending few dollars more buying separate camera mp3 player ( ipod shuffle only $69 ! ) ...... you'll get same functionality much better quality . -- dad 2x disappointed son :	-1

i got this after switching digital camera . digital cameras didn't offer depth i wanted not proofs big drawback . i am no means expert photography , but i know great photograph when i see one , this camera takes beautiful shots . this beautiful camera . elegant design ; grey body black accents definately attention grabber . people look your camera . it definately brains back up it beauty . loading film easy quick . it 8 or so presets . there automatic " point shoot " mode which you'll probably use most . it automatically compensates light , adjusting shutter speed aperture perfect shot . quick autofocus allows you grab your shot quickly , without waiting camera decide take picture . it also settings portrait shots , close ups , night , landscape , no flash , many others . those settings maximize camera features those particular shot . it also program setting where you program shutter speed , aperture , flash film advance . though comprehensive presets , i don't think you'll ever need use it . 28-90 lens comes kit nice , selector autofocus or manual focus . it also , course , removed so you add other lenses . zoom powerful leads beautiful shots . overall this unbelievable camera . great price , features , pictures best you've ever seen . they very crisp , clear almost 3d lifelike quality them , something i've never seen outside professionally taken photograph . this camera awesome	1
i looked digital cameras months - literally - before i just decided lug around 35 mm slr . everyone probably already knows , megapixels matter whole lot when you're talking blowing picture up larger size . what great film unless picture taken out focus , or bad light , you use negative blow something up quality really doesn't start go down until you're making huge prints . ( how huge exactly i don't know , but biggest i've blown up around 4x4 feet , still no trouble . ) prints i've gotten out this camera so far stellar . ( i use fuji film -- i think it better than kodak , even though kodak better commercials . give it try ! )the camera itself not too heavy , granted , it not convenience tiny digital camera , but it not bad i'd expected carry it around all day . neck strap nice , manual actually easy comprehend . i like camera buttons lot it features body -- it seems complicated first , but once you know how use features , they're much easier access than they would if you scrolling through menu . t2 seems worth hundred or so more dollars than you would pay very similar rebel k2 canon . one thing - make sure you take batteries out if you're not going using it week or more . it seems like they go dead if they're camera , even if it off	1

this my second fujifilm camera . i recently bought this one after my dog ate ( yes ate ) my older one ... i pleasantly surprised quality pictures i taken this camera comparison my older camera ( not sure model but it 3mp ) . i'm also not photography guru , perhaps thats why i like fujis , they pretty self-explanatory . outdoor shots shots right before sunset seem best !	1
perfect holder my hp camera . love magnetic clasp . though i removed wrist strap , it nice option ( i'll simply use actual camera strap toting ) . sleek look , extra pouch inside case hold extra memory card nice bonus	1
i really hedged sky caddie rangefinder . i've used both now convenience sky caddie hard beat constant readout yardage . however , given fact i often find myself " unique " locations any given course , there much said able shoot specific target get distance , which sky caddie doesn't allow you . sometimes you need odd distances lay ups , getting ball back play , etc . short , i would recommend this product . it easy use , appears very accurate . definite time saver course	1
i use this golf yardage when i'm location where yardage hard determine . very accurate . require steady hand . would not recommend more magnification than this one it would very difficult hold steady enough target small flag	1
ignore all glowing comments this product . resolution terrible , even fully cropped mug-shots just person face . you hold device arms length just make out some images since they so blurry any closer . save your money this one .	-1
excellent transaction . seller quick communicate ( automatic process ) , they delivered product fast safely . so far , it working great . thanks	1
i sony digi camera some time . i found features difficult use one carry manual around you reference . while pictures excellent general , i often failed get shot i wanted due some adjustment i forgotten or couldn't otherwise access . delay shutter excessive . then one day , camera ceased focus . sony wanted excess $200 make repair i decided look alternatives . this camera result i love it . menus very well thought out there onboard instructions everything . camera comfortable size . pictures sharp mechanism reliable . battery life amazing . size weight very convenient . shutter delay very short . best all , wifi feature dream . once you get it set up , you push botton pictures your computer without wires or hassle . ( you disable microsoft xp firewall however . ) i feel going company making fine cameras forever choice i should made beginning . i am buying two more similiar nikon model my children who off college fall .	1
this camera best digital camera i ever owned . very active person , i needed camera would hold up anything . waterpoof , shockproof .... everything proof ! it compact size makes it great sticking your back pocket during night out town , or packed away your backpack while traveling world . large screen makes easy viewing your pictures all functions very easy use understand . this 7.1 megapixel camera taks great pictures aren't too large so they don't take up too much memory which makes it espescially easy upload your picutres onto social networking sites without reformat them . you definately get your moneys worth buying this great all around camera .	1

lot already said there some excellent reviews here ( well elsewhere ) , but i just want add my 2 cents . i purchased this guy few months back , since purchased light second battery it ( i'll talk those shortly ) . my favorite features include : 1 . 3.5 " screen , which should must any camcorder , 2.5 " screens common today worthless imho . 2 . sliding door accessing hdmi port well other video ports . this unique sony ux1 sr1 hd camcorders ( far i tell ) best implementation i seen cover uncover ports . much better than little plastic plugs inevitably break-off lost . 3 . beautiful , detailed video . my least favorite features include : 1 . stupid little plastic cover plug power port . mentioned above , this camera great sliding door all its video plugs . inexplicably , sony used plastic plug power port , which right next video ports could used sliding door . stupid . mine already threatening break . 2 . short recording times . it hard blame sony short recording time dvds . this just fact life short time isn't limited hd dvd camcorders but it problematic all dvd camcorders ( though less so than here ) . you make choice you live it . while lots reviews mention dual layer dvds out there , they much more expensive i don't even really consider them option . luckily , lower quality modes still look very good , especially when taping outside . lower light situations , i would use higher quality settings . still , all video i take this thing looks better than any standard def . stuff you may see . also , related dvd issue camera insists popping up little comment saying it recommends sony brand dvds every time i put any other brand . this completely annoying sony should rethink way they try lock you their own brand . 3 . automatic lens cover . not bother cover great little addition this thing . features i thought i wanted but could lived without : i haven't yet used focus ring or mic or headphone out yet . i really wanted these , but retrospect , they unnecessary my home use . mic this thing plenty good , i just don't want mess focus end day . other notes : i purchased light extra battery here amazon couldn't happier them . light sony hvl-hl1 battery same one comes camera , sony npfm50 . light just right give boost indoor recording makes picture much better low light situations . it only 3 watts but seems very bright . it attaches hot shoe top camera . it priced right works flawlessly . grainy picture mentioned many reviews , i haven't noticed anything distracting . every camera positive negative aspects , but i am more than happy quality video this thing takes . i give this camcorder 5 stars not because it perfect , but if you weigh price features , i'm not sure there better hd or sd camera out there right now . it would not worth list price , but price they it now , you simply can't beat it , long you live dvd format . if dealbreaker you ( it wasn't me , obviously ) , it dealbreaker , but otherwise , this far best buy this price point	1
but you need very fast pc playback . 3ghz pentium 4 or equivalent simply won't cut it . i get jerky poor video my single core pc but problem fixed soon i move video my dual core amd box . keep mind avchd playback software so demanding both cpus running 90% utilization during playback . conclusion : there no way single cpu system pull it off . people who complained recording time mac incompability , those design technical limits . i am prefectly happy 15 min hd recording time per minidvd . if you need longer recording time , you should buy hard drive or minidv based camcorder . mac incompatible ? buy pc . they cost less than mac accesories .	1
this item one get . it roomy very durable . it stands tought nature wear tear some cases unavoidable . not mention this go almost any camcorder plus you know sure you getting best i quality because it made samsonite . i advice you look no further than this product	1
this good basic tripod . much sturdier than many others i've seen this price range . smooth controls . very easy use easy our children ( ages 10 13 ) use digital camcorder . comes two parts connect camera stand , so you pre-attach connections two different items ( e.g. , camcorder camera ) quickly attach detach each tripod needed . level works ok , but not positioned clearly not large higher end ( higher priced ) tripods ( e.g. , bogen ) . overall , good value price	1
great camcorder bag , just right size . i especially like detachable storage items you don't need your outing .	1
this really isn't bad everyone saying . compared what you get standard most cameras , this mic great job picking up dialogue . just point shoot . i'm pretty satisfied	1
i bought this year ago taken many great pictures it . it light , many features used automatic when all you want point click . i can't recommend it enough .	1
kodak makes great film , gold max one their best amature films . this film provides maximum versitility outdoor sports , decently lighted indoor shots . grain structure good , holding well up 8quot ; x10quot ; print . best part this film price ... i think kodak amazon.com real winner here	1
we pleased our new panasonic camcorder . we only used it few times christmas , but pleased picture quality . we knew looking different models store we wanted joystick operation only panasonic seems use . it could not more simple move choose options functions . image stabilizer works well image looks good even 10x zoom . many reviews stated , under very low light conditions you loose picture quality , but we found case lots cameras friends ours . we upgrade our computer drive read mini dvd-rs , so i cannot comment software yet . but we love menu funtion playback , no fast forwarding or rewinding , just shoot , finalize , put it dvd player choose what scene you want watch , it very simple . us simplicity not convert over tapes every time worth cost mini dvds short record time ( 20 minutes per disc ) . we very happy camera so far	1
this my first dvd camcorder i absolutely love it ! it also my first 3-chip video camcorder . image quality just really good , like other guys said . machine also apiece cake use . i e-mailed " gadgester " he recommended tdk 8.cm dvd-r blanks amazon , so i bought them now i just pop one go ! no formatting needed . finalization camcorder needed make dvd-r compatable my sony dvd player home well my thinkpad . one gotcha look out slow start-up times , power off . it takes anywhere 5 10 seconds camcorder ready record , after you insert yoru dvd-r . if you use dvd-rw , manual says it might take up 20 seconds ! other than , i no problems camcorder . it high quality , i just love conveneince well image quality .	1
i got my canon hv20 yesterday . just post several problems after testing it . 1 . handling . handling quite awkward . my hand feel very uncomfortable when holding it , it alway slips . i use other hand adjust it time time . also it quite hard switch camcorder when using only single hand . 2 . building : this camcorder not sexy previous one . it not cute , it not professional . but given its excellent video quality , this ok . 3 . noise : i shoot some video indoor 300w light bulb , i should say light fairly enough , but when i play it back using my 30 inch lcd monitor , i still find quite bit noise although their grain size not big . i tried " neat video " plug sony vegas reduce noise , it seems work pretty well . 4 . manual control . manual control part part really disappoints me . because i used lot photography . manual control this camcorder far slr camera . especially manual exposureit funny . say when i shoot video bright place , i set exposure -1 , then i moved dark place , then video very very dark . this means when you adjust exposure , you adjust its " absolute value " while not relative value . it doesn't mean you get less exposure all time . slr camera , if you adjust exposure -1 , it means no matter where , camera measure light then decease light coming relatively -1 its measured value . 5 . thing i recommend when you use this camcorder , try adjust contrast lower level , brightness lower level , no sharpening . this definitely give you lot flexibilities post editing	1
i work local camera shop , we just ordered few these cameras . i've chance test it out over past few days , i am quite impressed . i've worked many different video cameras over years , including few high-end cameras such canon xl2 panasonic dvx-100 i think it safe say hv20 best video camera you buy under $1100 . it comparable other hd cameras other brands such sony panasonic , but there few more professional features enable it rise above rest . main feature it got me so interested camera its ability shoot 24 fps progressive . normally , this feature could only found cameras starting $4000 above . this very cool feature , it lets you shoot feature movies look like film , achieve quite few effects only 24fps . feature i found quite useful ability switch variable fixed zoom speed . this let you zoom set speed , no matter how hard you push down zoom button . there countless other features this camera , but i suggest you just try it out yourself . without further ado , i think i'll get back admiring this wonderful camera	1
i bought this gift so i can't say personally how good it , but recipient stated she loved it . especially ability change frames match her decor it came remote	1
i got this my mom when i got digital frame my husband it very easy download pictures she show off all her grandbabies this awsome gift anyone color pictures great	1
great gift idea . easy download pictures use afterwards . just use close up shots able view them easier	1
i love this camera ! i looking buy new camcorder since my old jvc one broke . i got this one because sale price , but i'm so glad i . video clear , it lightweight , small . basically everything i'd want camcorder . obviously i'm not using any professional kind stuff , but family vacation filming , its great	1
fine 35 mm camera , simpicity design ; photos turned out beautiful . camera which very easy use . diane carde	1
this great little camera you take go . it so easy use . i several cameras , but i find myself grabbing this one when i'm running out door think , " i should take camera . " i like way cover slides over protect lens . when you open , it turns it you're ready go . zoom adequate 95% shots i want take . photo quality very good compact camera . i like mine so much , i just ordered one give christmas present	1
found out i use little liquid lubricant adapt my zoom lens adapter . minor issue , works great . highly recommend zoom , remember adapter or zoom not mount	1
this product worked exactly it supposed . i tried using cable came camera ( usb cord ) found out exactly what many others said blogs ..... it doesn't work !!! once i got this cable , it worked perfectly . i able easily download video my camera my computer . only frustration i i would rather paid little more camera gotten this cable it first place	1
this battery stays charged long period time . i two them so my camera always ready use	1
i cannot evaluate this product now . it item i bought use reserve it not used yet	1
i bought this battery spare my kodak z760 ( excellent camera ) , now i use 5001 more than original 5000 ( which now spare ) . it better battery far . its longer lasting charge means more pics , charges same time 5000 . i would buy this battery [ ... ] again , no second thoughts . price right , too ! definitely 5 star winner	1
this camera works very well . it small enough fit my purse ( size my cell phone ) it takes good pictures . zoom works good preset settings nice too . panorama effect nice bonus fact you don't spend time putting couple pictures together . i would definitely recommend this camera if you're looking something small compact always around	1
this great scope beginning astronomy -- beyond . it sturdy simple operate . it enough light-gathering power ( more important than magnification ) reveal dim star clusters , nebulae , galaxies good enough optics show you surface planets like jupiter , saturn , mars . affordable this scope , there no reason give so much glance trashy 60mm refractors exaggerated magnification claims litter market . some advice selection . dobsonians come range sizes ; bigger instrument , more you see . long-focus 114mm ( 4 � " ) like this one fine instrument , especially children others whose ability carry large objects limited . teen or able-bodied adult should consider going up 150-200mm ( 6-8 " ) scope . bigger dobsonians ( 250-300mm above ) too heavy bulky some people . some advice use . viewing through telescope less like playing cd more like playing guitar . finding objects takes little bit practice . simplify it , i would suggest supplementing finder supplied this scope " red-dot " finder aid initial pointing . you also need buy star atlas ( sky telescope pocket sky atlas best available ) , red flashlight read it without blowing out your badly-needed night vision , guidebook lead you interesting objects . these investments greatly add your enjoyment . what more i say ? this kind scope experienced observers trying steer novices towards decades . although , i recommend you your homework before buying any scope -- learn sky get know experienced stargazers who advise you -- when it comes time purchase , this scope fine choice . more advice , see my encyclopedic guide here amazon , " so you want buy telescope .	1
this , quite simply , one best buys smaller , portable dobsonian newtonian reflector scopes today . usually , two terms ( portable dobsonian ) mutually exclusive , but 4.5 weighs only around 22 pounds , which makes it quite portable , pleasure operate turn point its dobsonian base . i owned xt 4.5 xt8 . both phenomenal pieces gear . both capable deep sky views . used both , i assure you 4.5 capable clear views up around 200x . it even able handle increased magnification barlow lens high power eyepiece , utterly stunning close up views lunar surface really clear night ! saturn rings ' cassini division ' easily discernable well . course it won't rival views larger dobsonians , but 4.5 holds its own real , well crafted , quality telescope . adult bend down bit viewing , but i solved challenge simply putting scope milk crate , or using small , portable folding gardeners chair , which low ground . no big whoop . all all , great tool viewing heavens your kids adults	1

this good product . i like way it automatically resizes pictures fit full screen . image quality excellent . it like always looking your photo album . one complaint - colored trim rings magnetic don't line up perfectly due magnetism .	1
this nikon charger works very well . it always pays off use charger camera recommends . this charger works very well charges lithium batteries quickly ! top shelf product	1

soy un principiante en esto de la fotografia , esta ha sido mi primera camara slr , por lo tanto me ha tocado experimentar con ella para obtener las mejores tomas posibles la vez que han aumentado mis conocimientos en el area , el desempe�o es excelente tanto en tomas fijas como las que he realizado objetos en movimiento , tanto sus funciones automaticas como las profesionales ofrecen un desempe�o excelente , he tomado mas de 300 fotos en poco menos de cuatro meses , el zoom que tiene es rapido , los botones tienen una disposicion excelente para manejarla con una sola mano , lo unico que necesita es un flash de la serie speedlite , tuve oportunidad de conseguir uno prestado de un amigo el cambio fue estupendo ya que este tiene mas alcance para el lente que la camara trae , ya que el flash que trae carece de potencia el cual ofrece su mejor desempe�o en los 28mm del lente(no le podemos pedir mas un flash integrado ) , por ultimo les dijo que posee el mejor sistema de medicion de luz que existe en el mercado ( e-ttl)y esta disponible tanto con flash integrado como con el flash externo	1
this much better than battery supplied camera but i prefer bigger battery available this really cool camera , jvc bn-vf733 . caution , don't fooled ( like i ) buying so called " compatable " batteries , they not work . money you think you saving better spent buying real thing . james hatsisjames1@oconeeairservice.co	1
i left my camera charger hotel couldn't get it back . this exactly what i needed . camera just sits right it . they sent it quickly it excellent condition . hint : now , i'm putting small tag my chargers so when people find it , they'll know where return it	1
using this much easier than charging my casio cradle . this i never need worry running out battery power since i charge 1 battery while using other . someone like myself uses my camera shoot video , this important	1
casio series digital cameras nice little cameras . too bad they ( some ? ) must charged through cumbersome cradle . get this travel separate charger . it bit pricey but well worthy it . i never even unpacked cradle my z750	1
this camera what it says it : it takes 16:9 pictures video 10.2 mp pictures ok resolutions video . it takes decent video , if you put it tripod . built-in stabilization worthless video mode you'll get palsy type shaking no matter what you . other words , this not replace your camcorder . picture mode , it good job most outdoors/indoors settings if you're not too picky lens distortions around corners highest resolution . this especially obvious if you take pictures where vertical objects appear near left or right edges frame ( like stop signs , light posts , building edge lines etc . ) all all , decent buy home use . not something look into if you'll frequently printing your pictures posterity or use professional publications	1
very pleased tripod - it very nice silky feel catches threads hold head place . i wouldn't call it ' heavy duty ' any stretch , but it handle my nikon d50 nikkor 70-300mm zoom it , without much problem . i used video tripod my camera it kept everything pretty tight steady , even long nigh t-t ime shots . this one same , but isn't heavy or bulky carry . however , if you older , heavier camera or use heavier lenses , this might not you . all-purpose serious amateur use modern cameras , it fine . pretty lightweight travelling fits very nicely bag , which i also bought ( separate amazon vendor ) . minor irritations - i probably could use few more inches this , i'm 6 ' 2 " , but it manageable . also screw plate fixes camera needs screwed down quite tightly prevent movement . otherwise all fine so far - very happy product vendor	1
i'm not professional photographer , i canon s3 lensmate adapter couple filters , that it . main things i photograph my artwork , friends/family things reference images/ideas ( objects , landscapes , etc . ) , this tripod works great all those . it sturdy , looks nice works exactly like it should . i don't drag it around me all time i treat it well , i expect it last me least couple years . if you pretty much just lot miscellaneous amateur photography you'd like something better than those cheap , generic tripods but don't want spend ton money then i'd highly recommend this one . i think it great i actually pretty impressed it when i opened it up . two things keep mind , it isn't smallest tripod world it doesn't come bag or strap carry it	1
i am not much filming specialist , but i am very happy this tripod . it very sturdy easy adjust . quick release camera mounting plate nice feature . price it good choice	1
awesome camera ! looks good takes good pics . only down side lag time pictures	1
only thing not like this camera included software . it what it supposed , but feels clunky little slow . i purchased additional sd storage card card reader . this allows you upload edit your images into your pc/mac using whatever photo program you prefer . other hand , if you going make use easyshare features such instant emailing photos , flagging favorite shots while they still camera etc ., then you need use supplied software . lcd screen large . it easily smeared fingrprints , but when camera turned , you cannot see this all . sold feel . picture quality outstanding , battery life good , it very trim . excellent macro feature . fast start up writes images quickly memory . no complaints	1
i bought this camera when my old one exact same brand model broke . i loved it too much try anything else !!	1
i wish i'd this adapter long ago . shooting video more fun because how much more i see it . my camera movement seems more fluid , too , because wide angle . i also seem able frame shots more interestingly because greater field view i	1
i recently bought this camera upgrade my sony 8.0 mp 828 . this my third sony slr-like camera , my first one 5 mp 717 . i upgraded this one order get photos clear sharp possible miniature items i buy sell . i found 828 when upgrading 717 , there significant learning curve over previous cameras . however , now my third sony camera , i've discovered learning curve lasts month - then one start taking photos good results . learning curve r1 predicted . out box , camera impressive , if only just size ! it probably double weight ( or least close ) 717 , probably 25% larger than 828 . lens whopping 67mm - full increment larger than 828 . next thing you notice camera lack lcd viewfinder , which sony took off camera placed adjustable screen top camera . quite novel . quick walk around camera shows sony learned cumbersomeness 828 regard adjustments camera made r1 very " user friendly . " camera easy hold ( though heavy ) one hand , photographer able make adjustments his other - definitely making it two-handed operation . it seems just everything button back or side camera , once you learn where everything , it easy change exposure , etc ., just quick adjustment . what i ( if you're planning use it photographing small objects , this something keep mind ) major initial drawback focus length camera . unlike 828 , where you could within inches object shoot beautiful closeups , this camera requires least foot , if not more , order focus . once you get it right focal length ( after purchase macro filter - must ) shots glorious . however , what long focal length detailed photos mean ? you must camera stabilized ( tripod , etc . ) order get good shots . hand-held detail shots no-go this camera . also , if you like take . mpg movies through your camera , you'll disappointed . this camera not capability . far plusses , camera super high quality , relatively easy use . lens fantastic , rest camera seems equal quality . i've gotten used lcd viewfinder , able use it some great shots i might not otherwise able view fixed viewfinder . i also add my wife gotten quite savvy this camera , which first her . she able get some phenomenal photographs , particularly portraits , thus far . she loves this camera ! would i buy ? i'm not sure . i'm fan getting new toys , so i it . however , i think my 828 may take better ( or least easier ) close up shots . i must admit i haven't taken this camera road trip just yet take outdoor photos , i only imagine lens processor it terrific . my word advice would : if you highest-end quasi-slr , then this camera you . overall , i'm happy this camera , but i just don't know if it might just worthwhile moving over quality slrs don't cost much more than this , such canon 20d . though i'll happily use this camera now am giving it five stars there no significant detractors i found it , i believe my next upgrade quality slr .	1
i this camera since july 2006 grown love it . see what kind photos it take , take look eric pouhier work pbase . i took it three week tour europe my 14 year old son august . i took two memory cards ( 1 2 gb ) also took 80 gigabyte portable wolverine drive which worked flawlessly ( i only used up 6 gb ) . wolverine charger no trouble working overseas voltages ( nor sony ) . if you're used travelling slr , sony pleasantly surprise you . if you're used travelling compact point shoot , sony seem huge . i also canon 20d slr which also great . i mainly use canon bird photography 300mm image stabilized lens . sony basically useless bird photography ( unless you extremely cooperative- or dead- bird ) . most other purposes , sony better than slr . it takes great portraits landscapes . it fabulous cities photographing buildings ( great wide angle ) . it also fun candid shots using lcd view finder	1
its good always spare your coolpix camera these things run out when least expected ( when you're nowhere near your charger ) . i would recomend buying one these keep your camera when out	1

i've using this camera over year . i'm pretty satisfied this camera - taking account both price performance . yes , lens not cover , but i've always careful it . number reviewers complained batteries - my case i not encounter such problem - provided batteries served well half year then i just bought new ones , no problem really . it perfect taking pictures you want send e-mail or post online - while previous generations digital cameras failed capture large landscapes or anything distance . high quality printing it would not good though . still , me it pretty good camera within its potentialities price	1

if you're looking all one lens , this good one take . weight conscious travelers who want just one lens keep all times happy this option tamron . upon getting it , i put it my 20d , it hasn't come off since . i took it trip thru se asia it worked great nearly all light conditions . some focus lag if you start longer focal lengths , but fixed either switching manual , or just patien t.t he long end good unobtrusive people pictures , while short end great capture some stunning wide angle shots . it also sufficiently bright get some decent handheld pictures low light . other pros zoom lock kept lens extending when you don't want it . flexibility wide angle zoom without take off lens risk getting dust sensor well worth it . other than slow focusing , there few things i think would make me consider switching it other than using lens low light photography . i'm not sure i'll ever use lens came my camera again ... anyone want it	1
i've canon digital cameras past two years my first , opted purchase accompanying canon camera case . though it good fit , it couple flaws caused me look elsewhere case when i got my second digital camera this year . this time around , i chose tamrac case because , unlike canon , it zips closed . canon flap closure creates two big gaps either side case , allowing small particles get inside camera itself . second , tamrac features not only belt loop , like canon , but nice shoulder strap . this means user carry camera hands free without put it purse or backpack . this case fits many small film slim digital cameras ( go tamrac website download spec sheet lists camera/case compatability ) , so don't expect custom fit . my canon a510 , this case bit long side , but no so much so i concerned it shifting around too much case . it good bag great manufacturer decent price . recommended	1
my experience amazon very good almost excellence . products like description specifications exactally functionality products . i brings my thanks you great services fast work complete orders	1

these binoculars amazing they completely crystal clear perfect size you going hiking or walking . i would completely recommend this product	1
these great binoculars . i've owned much more expensive binoculars truely don't see any difference . great buy . they 100% waterproof since i flipped my canoe they not affected any way	1
this charger exactly what supposed , very quickly . there cordless model bit more compact	1
it exactly original i got my camera i got adaptor car , 220 plug " " socket type . cool	1
i got this lens mainly low light photography , initially disappointed i could never seem get sharp enough results . this because wide open lens very narrow depth field . work within this limitation , or better yet stop it down little , it becomes amazingly sharp . focus little noisy , digital slr 50mm more like 85mm , but it fine general purpose lens	1
you cannot even believe this lens . every time i put it my d200 i kick myself using anything else . it just good or better , btw , than 50 mm 1.4 . this lens all others should measured should aspire equal . it basically costs nothing . p.s. i didn't buy this price . i also love my $ 2,000 lenses , but use this little one more , honestly . pps . there one other lens you may want consider lieu this : sigma 30mm 1.8 . equivalent 50 mm 35mm camera , captures more scene , still great bokeh ( sexy blurrying background ) . either way , you'll get stunningly great pictures all kinds light . , it also great discipline use straight lens rather than zooming all time . truly .	1
sharp , cheap fast 50mm prime lens . f/ 1.8 aperture allows you take great pics low light situations without using flash lens gather more light . good potraits , indoor weddings , fast action shots etc . small dof wonderful potraits bokeh also nice . it also comes 5 year warranty . lens every nikon user should own . far negatives , nothing complaint , though macro feature would icing cake . i use this lens my nikon d80 .	1
i've played this camera few weeks now zoom great . it various scenes choose help you take pictures different settings , lighting , scenery , etc . it works very nicely . i haven't installed software , but loading pictures my computer very easy . battery seems little high maintenance , but its just matter not storing it inside camera . overall , its nice , easy use camera snapshots novices , extra zoom makes it all better	1
i just bought this camera so this review might changing near future . what i love : - 8.3 optical zoom . enough said . -menu systems . they pretty self explanitory , though reading manual helpful , especially if your not electronics saavy . -lightweight . it lighter than my smaller kodak digital camera . -macro mode . my favorite feature . macro mode absolutely amazing . i love able photograph jewelry much sucess insects flowers . great feature alone well worth money . -the price . i got great deal my camera just 214.00 major retail store . i wanted something i could take sporting events without dragging around my heavy , professional slr . i think i've found it . -i like way it feels . this might sound little weird , but camera fits well my hands . it comfortable use . what i don't like : -size . okay , i'm not really conserned size , mostly because i drag pro slr almost everywhere i go , but it big downfall this camera . bigger bulkier than most camera it class . not easily able fit pockets or purses . -software . i'm really not fond picture project came camera . i'm big fan easyshare ( kodak ) software came my second digital camera . layout picture project just doesn't appeal me . -slow transfer . it took forever it seemed like transfer my pictures . i top line computer , so i know it not my computer . right before i transfered my nikon pictures , i transfered my kodak pictures they transfered much quicker . -rechargable battery pack 2cr5 batteries . i don't really any trouble battery life ( i'm actually amazed how good it ) but i'm just not rechargable packs . i like aa battery type . they easy find both regular rechargable . my real gripe this camera take throwaway battery : 2cr5 . they expensive . they hard find . they don't last very long .	1
this great digital camera . i no problems it . i got it my 1st anniversary 2 yrs ago . its great ! you take pictures , put xmas , valentines or birthday borders around them b4 you take picture . it video too , you play back video , but there no sound because there no speaker camera , there mic thuigh . so when you download video , it play sound too . camera survivied dropped many times . i would like take long videos , so i am going purchase 4gb sd card . i feel sorry all people i saw complaining camera because i no problems 2 years now . only thing batteries die quickly ( using flash really drains battery ) , so i went bought high quality rechargable batteries , or disposable duracell meant digital cameras . also people who complained blurry pictures , it depends what setting you camera . i not like all those different setings , they just mess up pic . not use auto feature i always use non auto , egulr pic , flash . all those other settings confusing . oh yes great self timer when you noone hold camera	1
i received merchandise working condition promptly , lowest price . i use amazon again	1
if you own olympus digital camera this smart way keep fresh supply batteries . it simple use fairly quick . it charges both aa aaa batteries	1
these binoculars awesome ! clear view easy focus . camera really neat feature easy use . photos clear , but little grainy side ( which i expected they would ) . all all - binoculars rock camera fun , even if it takes less than perfect pictures . i would totally recommend bushnell digi-bino 	1
this fabulous camera ! item description not it justice long shot . this my first digital camera before purchsing it i went walmart web site check out their digitals . 7.1 mp $50 more so i came back amazon placed order . camera nice large screen back previewing , 20 mb internal memory . this large compared others similar price . pictures superb quality . my grandson connected it tv slide show preview special effects like expensive video . i am very , very pleased this camera	1
i bought this camera take mexican vacation could hardly take bad picture , even night . our company travel agent even suggested i submit some our newspaper travel editor ... 10x zoom would nice but it seemed well , even whale watching -- i couldn't see what i taking due sun glare but pleasantly surprised pictures i got . i'm only little peeved because i bought camera amazon gold box special price gone down $20 since i purchased it	1

i just got f650 replace my olympus f-110 . senior , i needed something larger viewing screen . this fills bill . easy use takes great pictures . negative note , call fuji help when i started download my first batch photos . problem program not populating . glad i bought ac5v power adapter , which they recommend , but only state you could lose your pictures if battery dies . unknowingly , problem battery low . however , manual not tell you even though you connect using power adapter , it not by-pass battery . i removed battery there it , ready download . recommend people get power adapter when connecting pc , remove battery your set go .... bottom line , this great camera i bought online $150 ....	1

i really love this product . it works great i hoped it would . nightvision amazing . screen monitor small , but picture usually very clear . one my favorite features ability put it standby mode . then when baby makes noise picture sound come automatically . this way i don't it staring me face all night while i try sleep . but it comes when i need it . we 5.8 ghz phone 2.4 ghz wireless internet system . why i chose this monitor it works great no interference . we baby her room upstairs take monitor all over house it works great . it run out batteries pretty fast if you don't it plugged , but it not much problem us . we just take cord plug it wherever we need it . i am very pleased . i bit worried after reading some reviews baby monitors , but i am very happy we bought this one !	1
this best color print film there . it even better medium format size . just sure find minilab fuji frontier machine get proofs made . it not saturated enough those cartoon colors landscape photographers seem obsessed past fifteen years or so . but it gives consistent results fairly low amount grain my personal favorite color palette . everyone should least try it . it sure beats anything i've able get outta digital ( imho ) . alas , i'm not sure whether or not order it online . i always make sure get film says it packed usa canada . imported stuff may sitting hot shipping container long time .	1
i owned this camera since it came out market . i used many different digital cameras - i believe this one most user friendly produces very fine images . it well constructed- i take mostly outdoor/nature photos traveled extensively this camera it held up remarkably well . i spent over 8 months one year fishing boats bering sea ... no problems . this camera captured thousands images ( intervolometer option - awesome ! ) inside it waterproof housing while strapped steel gantry 100 ' ships less than ideal weather ... no problem . this camera went me top ecuador highest volcanos ... only problem lcd freezing - now there few ' spots ' it ... but hey ... my fault it wasn't exactly warm up there 20,000 ' so , yeah ... it nice tuff little camera . if you want see some my images ak , check out - [ ... ] you'll need click each underlined link ... course image size reduced save space .... check it out	1
i received merchandise excellent condition , new , time . everything promised . thank you	1
i bought fuji s6000fd december 2006 help me take better pictures experiment advanced photography techniques . initially , i mixed feelings this camera several times even considered selling it get " better dslr " . but after thinking long hard using it quite bit comparing its image qualities , i come conclusion it indeed excellent camera what it intended . camera now keeper . i use this camera mostly travel family pictures . below my personal views this camera : pros : 1 . picture quality : this generally sharp excellent color rendition ( i use " chrome " ) iso 100-800 . 2 . noise : this becomes evident only iso 800-1600 , but they still usable after running pictures through neat image noise reduction filter , 25% amount iso 800 75% iso 1600 . i don't use iso3200 because loss details . 3 . slr-like : this closest thing slr manual twist zoom , program mode dial comfortable grip/ergonomics . fixed lens comes nice looking hood allows use polarizer filter creative control . 4 . live view/histogram : this without doubt best feature this camera . i use it every time compose my shots adjust my exposure compensation white balance " get it right first time " . result , i am getting very high percentage quality pictures out this camera without much post processing . this dslr , you take shot first , then preview lcd , make camera adjustments then take shot again . live view , it close wysiwyg . 5 . focal range 28-300mm : 28mm wide angle provides excellent coverage landscapes tight internal spaces . i don't use telephoto range much but it there when i need it zoom details . 6 . face detection : it works , so i use all people shots . 7 . movie mode : this bonus feature , works well enough it replaced my camcorder . i get 30 minutes video 1 gb card . manual zoom works but you move it slowly avoid " jumpiness " lens changes focus . 8 . aa battery : i already use rechargeables , so not buy spare lithium battery benefit . 9 . price : ~ $300+ quality/features , this camera offers tremendous value . cons : 1 . no image stabilization : this potential deal breaker many buyers . but compared other non-dslrs noisy pictures iso400 up , shooting iso 800-1600 fuji s6000fd offers " compromise " which somewhat compensates lack real optical image stabilizer . but this 2007 , so i think it should requirement include ois any lens longer than 200mm . i personally don't use long zoom much , so it less issue . but it would nice if fuji include this feature its next release . 2 . no shallow depth field : this means you can't isolate subject creating blurred background , universal problem all ps cameras small sensors . fuji s6000fd , there some work around , such using telephoto focal length combined macro mode , but blur effect not good what dslr produce . 3 . limited burst mode : continuous mode slow buffer limited only 3 shots . if you taken lot action photography , then this camera woefully inadequate . 4 . electronic viewfinder : brightness adjusted up or down but resolution only 135k pixels so it not sharp . 5 . auto mode : this camera doesn't produce good pictures auto mode or even natural mode because tendency use high iso . those looking simple ps should look fuji f20 or canon models . conclusion : there trade-offs any camera purchase . despite my initial hesitation , this excellent camera offers close ( but not same ) what you'll get dslr . i recommend this anyone who wants learn photography but not ready invest dslr . this would " perfect " camera ( me , least ) if fuji included optical image stabilization ( 2-3 stop advantage ) higher resolution evf .	1
i received lens adapter timely manner . however , i need send it back because i mistakingly ordered wrong item .	1
i've this camera 4 months now i am very pleased it . pictures clear , focus quick options endless . this my 7th digital camera i purchased 2 close up lenses t-con 1.7 it which really made it versital . large manual zoom anti-shake best part camera . it very clear lens i like when focus manual it gives zoomed look what you shooting . fz-50 close dslr you get without all expensive lenses drag . manual settings let you set-up camera you personnel needs . i'm really enjoying this camera .	1
i'm former 35mm photographer who little older not spry i once i eventually got out habit lugging case equipment everywhere i went . i got re-energized photography digital but small compact point shoot left me wanting more . digital slr pricey friend pointed out i'd back lugging case equipment around me her . she recommended this model more i looked it more i liked it . it fixed lens model , but 12:1 optical zoom what other lenses would really need . it start up fast , zooms focuses internally so there no moving barrel hold . it just every feature advanced amateur could want . it macro . it optical stablization system works advertised . so far i haven't come across anything it can't . this nice unit advanced amateur or even semi-pro who doesn't want go full digital slr yet .	1
i am only amateur photographer , but still . . . this small camera long nose gives performance one might expect slr film camer costing lot more , lot more complicated use . i caught digital bug sevearl years ago . my latest before this beauty simple little canon sureshot 3mp . great camera , but this camera same simplicity , but takes pictures which much more refined terms sharpeness not much more than i paid camera four years ago !! this panasonic lumix leica lens , which ' matched any other camera but it twin leica camera -- much more expensive piece equipment . long lens might put you off if you average family photog , but if you want all around 35mm-12x camera without huge heavy expensive bag lenses , like me , this baby you . it only looks massive . it quite lite manageable . i use it bird photographsy , but it could great any situation where you need get really close up just any lighting situation ultra-fine resolution . don't want spend mega bucks mega-camera ? this answer . i love it , i think your , too . easy use , easy wallet . if you're not quite there , try next model down , same focal length but 6 mp , couple hundred less . terrific buy . no , i don't work panasanic . i'm retired print editor . jim isha	1
this camera exactly what it suppose : convenient , reliable , compact , user friendly above all else , it takes good pictures . if you want camera takes great pictures , you'll need buy something little more expensive , quite bit larger . i bought returned several cameras this class before realizing no camera this size , sub $200 price range perform way my slr . said , if you don't mind playing exposure compensation iso settings , you take some pretty great pictures even low light . i learned long time ago worst camera one you don't you when great shot presents itself . z1 you'll never excuse . even case it fits nicely my front pocket without protruding too noticably . only issues i it doesn't continuous shutter mode , dock required charging downloading images . said , i'm still giving it 5 stars because i said , it exactly what it suppose .	1
i bought this frame my wife . she alot digital pictures no good way see them all . after reading reviews others , i decided try this one . she loves it . little card reader we our computer , she drag drop her photos sd card . then just plug card , hook up ac power , turn frame . it goes slide show automatically . we didn't bother re-size or crop photos . 1/2 " black bars each side photo just aren't bothersome us . no remote controls or sound features but if you're looking simple frame just show off all your digital photos , reasonable price , this one great	1

well .... this my first camera ever i attest accurately advertisement holds very true most features . picture quality fantastic , special editing camera capable ( built-in templates ) , different modes camera positioned take photos . one weakness i want point out it could hard determine which mode take appropriate picture ( outdoors , bad lighting etc ) . therefore , i strongly urge you read instructions which state , " please experiment this camera before taking photos " ( basically i paraphrased it ) . other than , this camera rocks !!! advantages outweigh disadvantages far	1
ok if you know your way around camera looking nice slim shot camera just around . then this great camera . i very nice digital slr camera but i really wanted something i could just take me . i admit auto setting not best you get , but it get job . however if you switch camera over program mode you whole bunch settings choose . i am very impressed what this little camera . it far most advanced setting any slim shot camera i used . 7.2 mp , you never really need push this camera , your pictures probably turn out alot better if you use 6 mp settings . just because it might speed up shutter time processing time . i am really fan long-exposer pictures , but i find myself situation where i want take picture but i didnt bring my huge camera bag . this little camera take these sorts pictures . just put night shot setting push +/- button setting come up your good go . findiing your way around this camera quite easy . there not lot buttons so few hours experimenting you it down . dont bother reading manual doesnt really help . pmp camera , it nice touch . although if you apple computer putting movies camera take little work , but it . putting text files it couldnt easier just save file txt throw it your camera again you good go . since i mac i definetly use itunes but most my music protected mp4 format . this camera not play mp4 , just mp3 . again all it takes little work you get those song your camera . just find converter convert song you want put them different file you computer just . i would gave this camera 3 but advanced feature easy learning curve really jumped it up point . i love this camera it serve well anyone . dont worried pmp features taken away quality camera . it feels if this camera cut out solid block metal . one last note , just becareful shooting , although it very nice lens , it also sensitive time movements , but it not bad compared many other cameras . all them this problems so dont let this scare you off . just right settings this problem corrected . i love it . i love it . i love it . samsung headed right direction slim shot camera market . also check out nv7 nv10 if you want extra boost lens quality functionality .	1
it nice product price . very compact . good quality video my purposes . battery life problem . i've using it tape portions my son baseball games , recording 10 seconds time pausing ( when he batting or pitching ) it barely makes it through game	1
after reading all " professional " reviews , i decided try mg57 anyway i am completely pleased . it may not top line , pro video / coffee maker but it very competent video camera . manual actually useful although you dont need it . menus easy use " auto " camera takes very good video or stills . i chose this over mg77 because it video light ( vs . flash ) i dont expect take serious still pics it ( although stills quite good ) . controls menus really well thought out ( big change most gadgets like my cell phone ;-) size weight very good unit always ready use , just open lcd 3 seconds later you recording ! mac sw supplied trimming clips combining them into one file burning or opening imovie , this sw simple but easy use exactly what needed . this very competent little camera i expect get lot enjoyment out i t.p.s. most my video taken indoors best results i manually set white balance ( very easy ) . low light video quite acceptable me ( good my sony dc20 but without tape bother )	1
i purchased this camera year ago i no problems it yet .. it also light weight compact .... great product ..	1
very good helpful device . adds quite bit bulk weight . i would recommend you use it when you can't get ahold smaller batteries , or you going trip . vertical shutter release comes very handy . it comes down this , if you want more battery life you accept more bulk your camera . even battery pack my rebel k2 still weighs less than most digitals i tried out	1
when you take long exposure photo whith motorized camera batteries drain whith first picture ( four hours exposure aprox . ) , you wasted 8$ or more , whith this baby you take four cheap aa batts take same photo less $ , recargeable nimh batteries best choice , i take three hours half exposure whith this ones . last , adorama ship fast very good package !	1
i purchased these because i don't like taking my $100 binoculars football games rock concerts . these perfect . optics little cheap , but $20 , i think it steal	1
bushnell powerview 12x25 fine , small pocket-sized binocular . since my wife avid bird watcher , we already several binoculars various sizes viewing power . our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 bushnell we used trips , so i researched , then bought this one amazon her birthday . she loves it . viewing power bit greater than other every bit compact , which makes it easy pack vacations , yet provides good viewing experience when enjoying various bird populations around country . we both highly recommend this , other bushnell products	1
small compact . let me see everyting i wanted	1
my son bought this camera his own this past summer take videos his friends skateboarding , etc . his desire get video editing software add sound effects , music , titles , etc . camera works great what advertised . always keep perspective $300 something camera not match up features extras $1000 something camera offers . real reason my posting this message relates how connect this camera your pc download videos . this how it work . 1 . ignore usb connection stuff manual . good still picture transfer webcam stuff only . look page 43 manual : " pc connection dv interfac cable " . you must use this method transfer video . 2 . you need " firewire " ieee 1394 ohci compliant card your computer . i purchased added pci trendnet tfu-h33pi my 5 year old hp xl773 computer i also recently loaded windows xp . 3 . here key . i bought cheap sanmax 4pin 6pin 1394 cable . could not get camera recognized computer os . xp it should recognize camera soon you connect it turn it camera set playback mode . xp treat it like new hardware first time . i tried everything reload card software search online drivers through forums answers . then i remembered my neighbor video editing . i took my sons camera over his house his computer recognized pv-gs19 panasonic camera right away . i then plugged my sanmax cheap cable into his computer ... nothing . it cable . i borrowed his belkin shielded $25+ cable plugged it into my computer it worked . moral story . don't skimp firewire cable . they not all created equal .	1
this great camcorder . i've read people problems uploading video computer , but i not tried yet . we purchased camera film everyday things ( holidays , dog , etc . ) it works much better than i expected . zoom feature great -- i can't believe how crisp film things so far away . i've even used camera place binoculars our travels because you see everything screen so clearly . we also play back video car our way home travels enjoy watching it mini screen listening audio . most unexpected benefit camera how easy it take pictures film . we watch what we filmed tv just hit picture button snap digital photos after fact . it fantastic ! i really like digital camera camcorder one ; it one less thing carry . again , i can't speak computer upload film , but not everyone wants either . only drawback camera it doesn't light or flash . however , we haven't found we really needed it yet , we filmed lot inside out . i am so happy camcorder !	1
i received my cd timely fashion spent three hours playing it soon possible ! thanks prompt service	1
remember cell phones 80 ? that what this reminds me . it doubles weight camera . however , only other downside i now need carry extra tapes because i now film everything i want not worry conserving battery time . i burned through almost 2 tapes ( long play ) during day disneyland , used lcd screen entire time even play-back while waiting line . hindsight , i wonder if 2 4-hour batteries would smarter purchase , but would one more item keep track . cameras today so small light , large hands like mine benefit extra weight , but only point . summary : extra weight , but allows you completely forget time , concentrate shooting anything everything you want . michae	1
i used this camera pool get ready our family cruise . it works great . you need read manuel prior use follow directions . works great water case works great land very sharp pictures	1
shipping very very fast cost paper low enough they still beat out everyone else i could find net total price , even pay shipping	1
i am just average guy when it comes using camera . probably below average . i started trying use 100% sony electronic products because my computer sony sony-sony linkages make easy use . given , here what i think product : 1 . it amazing how much camera you get money . compared just 6 months ago , or year ago , this lot camera money . it very small , fits easily your pocket , but takes great pictures . also , it very easy use recharge . 2 . visit sony website , suggests sony new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras very similar . this makes it hard compare cameras , even within sony brand , makes you feel if your camera obsolete minute you buy it . 3 . problem this camera , given it so small -- not shake . your pictures blurry . i am typical guy , very little fine motor control . my hands trouble holding small objects . holding this camera one hand taking picture -- well results not pleasant . 4 . i tend disappointed telephoto capabilities these small cameras . i guess if you really want zoom , then you go big camera . but it still seems like small cameras could offer more . 5 . said all , end , this camera small easy carry , light weight , durable , it also easy use . when you look it , it looks well made . i ended up giving camera my in-laws , because they lost theirs . my in-laws tend technologically challenged . i said them , just leave dial set little green camera , snap away . i say - they love this camera . overall . money , great purchase , technology amazing . just grab it two hands or develop steadier aim than i .	1
after using my friend cannon 30d its nicely sized viewfinder i cant understand why oly made this one so small . this magnification only helps , it doesn't fix problem	1
number photography review sites recommend eyecup magnifier olympus evolt e-500 i purchased it my e-500 . complaint e-500 view finder small compared other dslrs market . eyecup magnifier fixes this problem instantly ! i was/am glad i paid extra it ! i think olympus should include it standard piece e-500 package , obviously isn't going happen . if you purchase evolt e-500 only afford one accessory , buy eyecup magnifier	1
you get what you pay , great outdoors pictures using uv filter great color effects , also indoors using fl filter . bargain price	1
i extremely impressed this camera ; i felt only not exceptional feature its nonwithstanding aptitude steady shots . other than , i felt it fantastic , exceeded all expectations	1
i'd like share reasons why i bought this camera strongly recommend it : 1 . innovative design size . i absolutely love design compact size this camera . any other innovative products , form factor this camera received mixed reviews . i think it perfect , i no problem handling holding camera when filming . you give credit sony : there no other dvd camcorder market this compact , even after year market . 2 . media support . this should number one criteria when buying dvd camcorder . i read several reviews other dvd camcorders complaining issues finalizing discs or playing them standard dvd players . i no issues whatsoever discs burned this camera , finalizing discs very smooth process : one click few minutes . this camera supports dvd-r , dvd-rw dvd+rw . most dvd players play all these formats . dvd+rw format allows you view disc most dvd players without finalizing disc , while dvd-rw format allows you edit delete scenes disc when used vr format ( though this format typically supported dvd recorders only ); both rewritable formats formatted reused many times you'd like . note capacity discs 30 minutes sp mode ( or 60 lp mode ); this limitation size discs , not camera . you buy double-sided discs which allow you record 60 minutes sp mode , but you manually swap disc , so it equivalent using 2 different discs . 3 . it sony camcorder . i mention i not owned other brand camcorders , just because i've extremely satisfied sony camcorders . they not only cool design , but they also best terms ease use reliability . i cannot vouch quality this camcorder yet , but i expect this last , it seems well built . it also comes carl-zeiss lens , which among best market . 4 . other nice features worth mentioning : * usb cable allows you copy any or all recorded scenes your computer , even if disc hasn't finalized . * almost all functionality driven touch panel , main menu programmable which allows you add only features you use most . ok , so this camera not perfect , it some areas improvement : 1 . if you buying this camcorder take still pictures well recording video , this not your camera . resolution stills only 640x480 ( less than 1mp ) , quality so poor it not even worth using it stills . 2 . poor low-light filming no nightshot feature included . 3 . no upgradeability , because its compact size there not lot room attaching typical add-ons : microphone , flash , or headphones ( though you use adapter a/v cable ) . battery provided lasts 90 minutes , however you buy larger battery , np-fa70 which lasts up 180 minutes . 4 . original msrp $699 , this camera expensive , if you pay less than $500 this camcorder , you getting good deal . if you're willing pay over $600 this camcorder you're not crazy its design/size , you might better off buying dcr-dvd203 , least you'll get 1mp digital camera	1
i've using this 2 weeks now i love it ! it very user friendly touch-screen controls . i only wish dvds could last longer than half hour , but size this model i over look	1
we needed easy use , lightweight , quality video camcorder anyone could use . sony dcr-dvd7 great . worked excellent vacation , our beach video images excellent - " easy button " makes whole experience shooting video snap . when we reviewed video quality surprising very good price this camcorder . we jvc camcorder we paid double price which i find difficult/complicated too heavy use . note : dvd7 so easy use - example ; i holding one dog ( 7 month old wiggly puppy)in one arm , using our dvd7 other hand capture our other dog playing tag sand crab , video images turned out steady , focused , clear . digital still images - i not purchase this device still images . if all i wanted still images , i would use disposable camera beach , our sony digial camera other times . now software : easy fun use . ** battery - really last full hour ! i using it video , play-back video , not still pictures . overall impression : i wanted point shoot camcorder great video images . here all you : insert dvd , turn power , touch " easy button " , shoot . if you want lightweight , easy use , excellent video images , battery lasts full hour , dcr-dvd7 exactly all these things .	1
i purchased this bogen ( manfrotto ) swivel/tilt head bogen ( manfrotto ) monopod . i wanted something stabilize my camera without carry tripod . this head great !!! it comes plate attaches camera . then you simply place camera device it snaps shut . it easy pull lever disconnect your camera . prevent you doing this accidentally , it safety lock you deploy flick your thumb . i recommend this other folks wishing stabilize their camera not lug tripod around	1
i canon s3 got this go manfrotto 676b monopod . used it numerous times it works great	1
this came quickly very competitive price . it works well my fuji s5000 camera - noticeably wider view minimum zoom	1

this camera great quality ! photos unbelievable color detail . it great camera price . software fine , but not amazing , but great enhansing , color effects , cropping , fun effects	1
we purchased this photo album christmas gift our 25 year old son who down syndrome . this good purchase he loves watching photos he taken himself his digital camera . we simply showed him how slip his sd card into slot told hiim wait it load . we it set slideshow after unit turned , it loads shows all pics card loops repeat . this unit operates very simply . we not " format " pictures into unit . we no idea what others complaining . we purchase leather case not use frame on/off button , plug electric cord all other switches ports accessible case . leather case substitute frame it stand itself when opened . frame clumsy opened get controls . frame could engineered more logically . we also purchased rechargable battery this good choice well . it makes unit totally portable seems adequate playing time . it never lost power while our son using it . " portability " this unit big draw if we could make only one suggestion it would battery should part package rather than purchase it company separately . we glad we purchased this item our son it brought him much joy ! we listened less complimentary comments others submitted not purchased unit , our son would missed out one his favorite " gadgets " . we rating this 4 stars only because we think battery should included original package replacements should available purchase stores . we also think frame itself should access openings all switches ports .	1
small compact-functions well . good not only road , but also when you want recharge your spare battery without " tying up " your camera .	1
this camcorder best deal if you looking something easy use don't need newest bells whistles . it small light , making it easy hold record . options there zooming , light , snapshots , etc . so far quality great . even if it lasts just few years , this price it still well worth it . would definitely recommend it	1
wonderful camcorder . very easy use really small . enjoyed it christmas my grandchildren	1
i really like this camera . it 10x optical , image stabilization , 3.0 inch lcd 230,000 pixels , more . size great 10x zoom camera . image stabilization great getting shots would come out blurry my canon powershot a620 . my other favorite feature besides zoom image stabilization , wide angle . it great finally get cityscapes whole skyline one shot !! camera set 16x9 , i get 24mm shot ! what i don't like this camera it short battery life . even the1300mah battery i bought , i get less shots than my canon . colors photos this camera lot less colorful than canon . something i get used . i very disappointed find out this camera no zoom movie mode , unlike its predecessor , tz1 . luckily , not stop me buying this camera . overall , this camera great buy , especially if you want i.s. wide angle , long zoom	1
i just received dmc-tz3a . i love this camera . this my first camera ever . i love features , build quality , menu system . i am still getting used learning how take quality pictures . example , i trouble getting it focus times . i am certain this just learning curve me . one feature i am disappointed it lacks - auto retraction lens when playback mode . most other cameras automatically retract lens protect it when viewing pictures camera . this one not this you turn camera off get it retract . i really wish they would update firmware support this important safety feature . all-in-all i definitely recommend this camera	1
matsunichi seems get it right - price , size , resolution . main problem * all * digital frames resolution . while typical print gives you around 200-300 dots per inch , most digital frames offer mediocre values 72 100 . matsunichi offers you quite respectful 125 dots per inch . this means images look absolutely perfect distance two-three feet - even if you 20/20 vision . other positive things i want mention : - it offers excellent view angle - i would estimate it 170 degrees screen bright crisp great ( lcd screen ) color reproduction- it usable remote control- it understands all major memory cards- it plays mp4 movies sound , though manual says they recommend use compact flash card ( i tried sd without any problem ); movies pictures may mixed slideshow- it play unprotected mp3 music background- frame internal software upgradeablefrankly , frame ability play mp4 movies not so easy use - because most digital cameras produce video clips different format . it not play drm protected mp4 movies music ipod either . bottom line here - this just picture frame , not tv or music player . now not so good news . this frame not internal memory - so you need memory card , but not rush buy new 2gb unit . it seems this frame only display first 256 images any memory card , so old 16mb memory card you received your camera two years ago suddenly may become useful . slideshow parameters broken - power frame always resets 10 seconds interval pictures . problem maximum selectable interval 30 seconds - i would prefer it 10 minutes range . because software upgradeable there chance matsunichi fixes these bugs eventually . frame tiny internal speakers produce sound just laughable - not expect anything good this area . other hand there audio/video output cable ( included ) , so you attach external speakers and/or tv ( standard resolution ) - but i not see how it fits product intended usage pattern . all thing considered - this solid 4 stars . i could give it five if not problems mentioned above . matsunichi seems go right direction offering affordable useful product great consumer value .	1
image real sharp bright , however , instructions could clearer . grandkids like seeing themselves pop up brilliant color	1

this got best camera money you buy right now !! i looking affordable camera , small thin , well-known name brand , takes sharp digital photos , shoot low light , uses cheap sd cards , good-sized lcd display , take decent videos . well , this casio exilim everything more , great price . i used it so much during my out-of-state travels without running out power or memory ( i bought 2gb sd card $20 [ ... ] i take more 1000 hi-res photos or hour video ) . i absolutely surprised how good videos i shoot this small digital camera , now i decided not buy new video camcorder , this casio exilim all i would need any occasion . if you're market great camera , look no further than casio exilim	1
this product exceeded my expectations performance , picture quality ease use its excellent . i already recommended this product 4 my friends , its must gadget 8 inch screen it just capitavates you every time you look it . well worth buying	1
i purchased 55mm filter my konica minalta 18-70mm lens . quality filter excellent . my photographs exceptionally sharp , course , filter protects lens . when using lens 18mm , due thickness filter band , small bit vinetting evident . this expected standard filter used strong wide angle focal length . those doing extensive wide angle photography , special thin banded filter better choice . overall , excellent filter great price	1
this one best presents i ever gave my elderly mother . it kept her touch members her family who scattered across three continents bring them her home . she loves it - once you programmed it , it requires no maintenance , not turning off , nothing . it switches itself automatically every day displays anything up 300 photographs sequence or randomly . great present . only one small complaint - device downloads images card onto its own rather limited menory rather unpredictable uncontrollable fashion . i believe more recent models fixed this problem . but don't let this put you off . you give someone great pleasure offering it them	1
i bought this camera back september when it new $200 ... now i see price mere $140 . wow ! point shoot cameras go down value quickly ! i originally wanted get film slr camera but i didn't know much cameras i needed something quick easy pick up learn . time cheapest film slr also $200 . i figured i'd probably spending more film developing long run so i just got this camera instead . it came 2 regular aa batteries , av/usb cable , thin cotton sleeve , carrying strap , instructions , warranty info , cd rom . first it pretty easy use . all i ended up photographing first few days just simple little things around town or around house or whatever using auto mode . first picture i took my dog . few days later i buy some rechargeable batteries because lets face it , regular alkalines not last long high-draining devices . i started taking more more pictures following weeks experimenting different scene settings learning adjusting lighting focusing my camera it job without any problems . it very easy use that what i liked it . it decent size also . i could just put it my bag i'm off wherever . once i filled up 32mbs internal memory i went out picked up largest capacity memory stick best buy which 512mb ms duo around $60 it well worth it . i wanted duo because i like view my photos my psp ! following months i also picked up vad-peb lens adaptor , wide angle telephoto lens also some filters basically maxed out this camera its full potential . overall i'm pretty impressed this camera . it simple use features make it easy anyone pick up take great photos . over months i it i've definetley seen improvements my photography skills i've basically learned all its ' features mastered this camera . before i just pointing shooting here there ... i just got back trip down oregon coast i've taken some breathtaking photos even people dslrs impressed . i've also used it record me riding bmx too . seeing i've learned thing or two taking amazing pictures i am more than happy because i never knew anything photography before i picked up this camera now it my second favorite hobby . see this camera gone down price -- well i can't recommend it enough you beginners . but don't fooled fact it only point shoot . give it some time creative because you eventually learn how take amazing pictures . if you want best out this camera though , sure pick up vad-peb ring , 512mb memory stick , bunch lenses filters you one finest 4.1 mp cameras market sure . eventually i end up picking up nikon dslr camera because this little sony camera only beginning my passion photography . but i not sad when i lay this camera down ! it taught me basics ease i am thankful . reason i give it only 4 stars following reasons below . 1 . if you get vad-peb ring adaptor , your flash blocked . 2 . zooming really far increases chances blurred pics . but it nothing little iso 400 tripod can't fix . 3 . night pictures take awhile process normally come out blurry if you can't hold your camera still . otherwise , back tripod . 4 . focusing only certain subjects takes awhile learn . but like i said , give it time	1
i bought this camera 3 months ago used it few times . last week all sudden pictures look out focus over-exposed . i haven't changed anything or anything . i no idea what wrong camera , but given price i'm pretty annoyed amazon.com not refund my money because it over 30 days	-1
i've camera over year , taken several thousand pictures it . it pretty darn good overall . i've pleased image quality , especially scenery shots . it fall somewhat short portraits people many cases , though . easy use . minor durability problems .	1
i bought this camera my wife christmas after i bought it she talking said she not like hp products . well she opened it christmas said it looked nice . after she took 40 pictures it i could not pry it out her hand crowbar .. it takes great pictures very easy work . she even let me take couple pictures it . so it shows you don't spend lot money get great camera . keep up great work hp ..	1
this camera basically norm disposable cameras , it isn't too hard see why . if you just want cheap camera works well very reliably , this one you . if only this camera could zoom , but asking far , far too much disposable . also , try smacking bottom this camera set off flash without taking picture ; just useless tip	1
great addition gadget bags when smaller version just won't	1
highly recommend . huge difference pictures . i quite amazed cannot live without it anymore	1
love love love this camera . simple , easy use , just point shoot . i handed this off my husband no instructions one day said " take some pictures " ! he turned it , saw button taking pictures , found zoom button off ! he so impressed , i kept telling him fujis really intuitive now he believes me ! takes wonderful pictures , nothing complain . fine low-light , outside , sunny days , cloudy days . i haven't found situation where it doesn't work well . there all sorts manual settings you use if you want , fun dual picture option ( takes two pictures row , one flash , one without flash ) , or just let camera decide you based upon situation . definitely recommended my friends , i just love orange color . sure makes it easier find when you put it down covered end table ! :	1
honest , i am more particular canon sony cameras , but my wife got this herself so i got play it . it very nice lcd screen , decent battery life , easy navigate menus controls . it comfortable hold . pictures it produces don't seem any different then my canon sony cameras computer web images , but i haven't tried any prints yet . i don't think it turns quickly enough , not like my canon sony point shoots . my style " shooting hip " so speak , random , sudden , unpredictable moments . also , usb cable it uses connect computer not standard , it not work same cable my other cameras use(they all work same cable ) , but it comes its own . or just get card reader . fun	1
i bought this my 9 year old daughter she loves it . she use all functions make movies . very easy use takes great pictures . would good begining photographer , great price too	1
dsc-t100 very good camera i would highly recommend it . i several generations cybershot series ( dsc-t1 , dsc-t9 now dsc-t100 ) they've all great , high quality cameras . this camera takes beautiful pictures . pictures clear , little no white bleeding , superb colors great contrast . lens bigger than previous models so it works better low light conditions apparently this camera uses noise reduction technology used new high end sony cameras so pictures should less noisy when it dark too . movie quality 640x480 30 frames per second audio . unlike previous models you zoom while recording movies ( big plus ! ) , whereas previous models you locked whatever zoom level you set before you began recording . also , movies saved into mpg not quicktime so you're not locked into video forma t.t he camera bigger than previous top-end models , but not much . i imagine they made change fit 5x optical zoom ( over previous 3x ) . while they extra depth they threw 3 inch lcd ( instead 2.5 ) larger battery ( drive larger lcd no doubt ) . i personally preferred feel dsc-t9 , but i accept trading features bit more size . downsides camera few minor , if i could i would given this product 4.5 /5 , but they don't let you . but , here problems i this camera . 1 . reduced buttons : previous models they removed buttons replaced them software driven menus . while i not mind software menus , i mind not choice using software menus using physical buttons . they really should included button delete i really want switch pick movie mode picture mode . it takes few extra seconds switch previous models i don't like . companies seem think it makes something easier use if they make it software driven , but really it makes it harder slower use . 2 . options not very accessible : software menus impose too many limitations . i should able cycle through all flash options flash button auto mode , but i go into program auto mode it , i use software menus it . this camera ability set brighter flash or dimmer flash , but it takes so long change i won't ever able use it . same type problem applies red eye reduction ( although , i don't think it necessary because it doesn't seem red eye problems since flash further away lens ) . 3 . camera still missing options dsc-t1 . when i bought my dsc-t9 i remembered so angry they changed removed options , still they're missing . example , you cycle through different display levels ( normal , normal histogram , bright , etc . ) . dsc-t1 there option turn off backlight , which increased battery time dramatically . but , you can't this newer dsc-t9 or even newest dsc-t100 models . 4 . it sony so you pay lot more it . camera reasonable price , but make it useful you need buy memory stick pro duo , which costs considerable amount more than sd cards ( even though they same technology ) . you also may want docking station , which far overpriced , all various other peripherals more expensive then this should also . don't let negatives discourage you though . this good product sony deserves praise making it . i just wish they'd consult me before they marketed it . :	1
this camera pretty incredible . you so much camera itself , before you even upload pictures . it so advanced compared my previous fujifilm digital camera or any other camera i've seen matter . only thing little bit bummer it little slow times due capacity information it processes , but it well worth couple seconds extra wait time . i am extremely happy satisfied my purchase am looking forward seeing what hp comes up next .	1
i love this camera !!! screen huge ! pictures come out great !! there not much you can't this camera , great investment if you love taking all kind pictures indoors , outdoors , light , or dark !! great job hp !!!	1
this pocket sized stainless steel package delivers more than i expected . it easiest digital camera use than any i've owned or used . i get more use this camera simply because it truly pocket sized camera i carry it me most time . huge 3 " lcd display one most outstanding features . its battery strong not let me down yet . camera much quicker use than low resolution camera built into my cel phone . video audio quality very good . this feature packed camera one best values out there	1
very versatile use because its many features . easy use basic point shoot mode . difficult aim accurately outdoors bright light because display washed-out background light	1
i decided get one new stylus cameras my old camera dying new ones water resistant ( supposedly waterproof ten feet ) . i lot canoeing i believe dampness hastened demise my previous camera . camera takes excellent pictures 4 power optic zoom works quite well . i used it indoor outdoor pictures . while it not versatile slr types , it good quick pictures which mostly what i take these days . it fair amount versatility , but it takes bit time adjus t.t he only downside i found camera it not viewfinder , only screen which tends wash out bright light . this not posed serious obstacle any pictures i taken date , but it restrict ability finely compose picture . if this issue could resolved , i would absolutely nothing but good things say this unit	1
this camera really fits niche if you like hike , bike , canoe , raft , kayak , etc . rubberized corners sealed design , it made adventure . i've dropped mine , rained , splashed big time- without problems . also , it most features all other camera . easy use , rugged , good pics- i highly recommend it . i use it often my blog : www.riverrant.blogspot.com . many photos this camera posted .	1
delivery camera very prompt . camera what i expected , i am very pleased it portability , usefulness . sanyo support vpc-c6 camera great sanyo firmware update downloads . thanks	1
i just purchased c6 took it disneyland video kids . bottom line i love this cam . here my thoughts after using it one week : without doubt , size makes this camera so much more usable than larger models " go " shooting . i mini dvd cam fits your palm , but you can't put it your pocket . me , its pain get it out fanny pack or whatever i miss shots . trip like disneyland , it so nice able this thing my pocket able take it out fast discretely shoot all kinds great shots rides , etc . after few hours , i could literally take it out my pocket , flip screen up my thumb shooting 3 seconds ! able go back forth pictures video gave me way more shots i wouldn't get dig out camera . i just hate carry around all gear . far quality , photos turned out pretty good . i expected less based other reviews . i not enlarged anything yet . my only complaint would bit overly saturated colors . i may able fix setting camera . best shots bright sunlight pool . video quality decent , better than i expected low light . it focused pretty well low light . i got some good results indoor rides . my favorite thing hold camera out shoot myself my son ride . size makes this easy course you turn screen around so you see yourself . i it my dvd cam , but it gets heavy bulky . anti-shake not great . you really watch how much you move it around . it works , it just could better . i didn't problem stills even when zooming . like others , i found you get lots camera noise when taking picture during video . wind reduction works much better than my other cam ( panasonic dvd model ) . sound decent overall . flash very weak . 6 ' max i would guess . weaker than my pentax optio digital camera . i not take lot indoor/night shots though . i really like how fast it warms up . when you turn it or flip up screen , it ready go just few seconds . this why i don't like dvd cams , warm up really slow ... like 30 seconds my panasonic vdr . i lose lots shots becuause this . i like buttons all front accessed thumb . it took bit get used its small size . there slide type switch go back forth viewing recording so you it fast without menu . i forgot buy extra battery which mistake . i don't know how much life i got , but i started out each day 8:30 am noon it dead . but i took lots video flash pictures . i really like docking station becuase you don't take battery out charge it you plug into tv watch videos . cool use docking station it doubles table-top tripod . i used it video fireworks show pretty good results . remote worked ok , but one bad feature if you paging through bunch clips tv you stop 10 seconds , it goes back different screen you page all way back through clips get where you . maybe this changed setup , but i don't know . also , there now battery level indicator screen . battery just died . i think you check it menu , but pain . i got two , 2 gig sd cards . sandisk extremes ( or ultras i think ) . it writs them super fast . no issues so far . each card gave me 80 or 90 minutes hights quality . i didn't fill them all up 5 days disneyland . lens cap cheap plastic kind hard get off but i got used it . it working ok , but i bet it crack before long . they should figure out how integrate one slides off . bottom line : if you like me don't like tons gear hanging around your neck or fanny pack or whatever , this camcorder you . i able get more cool shots becuase its speed size than using my dvd model . i don't put so much weight quality , becuase family vacations its way more important get once lifetime shot my kids doing something cute than image quality perfect . now i just need learn how use imovie put all these clips together	1
this camera great value , i bought it two lens package . normal lens good zoom lens huge . i bought 133x speed 4gb flash card pictures i've taken some amazing shots . sports mode great skiing captures very fast movement . focusing little more elaborate so takes bit getting used if you're coming compact digital camera . highly recommende	1
i this camera 4 months now its outstanding pro-sumer grade digital slr . amazon price this camera body two lens kit simply best price found anywhere , less than most vendors charge this camera single lens . no longer i mourn loss my nikon 8008s 35mm film camera . both lenes outstanding optics metering system superb . included lens hoods very helpful , but make sure you take them off flash photography . lenses operate quietly quickly . they nice grip . built-in pop up flash adequate close-up snap shots , but you'll want one two available dedicated flash units fl-36 or fl-50 . don't waste your time or money fl-20 . i bought fl-36 , which full featured dedicated flash significant manual overrides just camera meet your creative needs . i'm likely further upgrade fl-50 which more powerful full professional grade flash . serious photographers , this camera gives you total manual control provides overrides every possible setting ensure you realize your full creative needs ( just any professional 35mm or digital slr ) . automatic settings focus exposure outstanding well . there several program modes various types shooting user program mode where you essentially make your specific manual settings automatic set-up . controls well placed , except one-touch white balance auto-focus frame buttons right where you may normally want place your right thumb while holding camera , especially if you're taking vertical shots . large lcd display excellent easy read even bright light , but advised its not composing lining up your pictures . display making your camera settings viewing pictures you've taken . you must compose your shots through viewfinder only . viewfinder gives you gives you plenty camera setting information immediate exposure composition feedback so you make adjustments without removing your eye viewfinder . camera shoots every file format complete amatuers want serious professional photographers need ranging various degrees quality jpeg all way up tiff several raw settings . shutter speeds go manual settings up 1/4000th iso range up 1600 . camera built solid , very well balanced lightweight . it looks great feels great nice grip . included olympus lbh-1 battery extraordinary life . i camera first 3 months without change or charge . time i took over 600 pictures , often found i left camera when i went pull it out my bag next shoot . fact , during my trip ireland during this mentioned timeframe . i basically left camera night day entire week juice spare when i got home . phenominal ! mentioned included lenses this kit ( wide angel normal normal long telephoto ) very , very good . i'm so pleased overall performance capabilities camera itself , i'm definitely going invest heavily professional level lens upgrades . exception macro extreme wide angle , those lenses essentially same focal lengths included this camera kit . however upgrades " faster " lenses allowing more very low light levels greater ability capture sports activity . bottomline , this camera fantastic everything far more expensive professional cameras . olympus full range accessories serious professional photographers amatuers work their way up . this camera it all price no one seems able beat	1
pretty comfortable . could more practical couple inner pockets	1
pros : good those who want automatic camera those who want adjustable settings . cons : software awkward . it can't used webcam . bottom line : great camera lot features used beginners enthusiasts . why you buy this product ? my husband i got fuji finepix f31fd digital camera our christmas gift december 2006 . we wanted something replace our current digital camera which quickly becoming more more irritating because it not take good pictures low light it not zoom feature . describe your experience using this produc t.t he fuji finepix f31fd digital camera arrived when my husband work i home vacation . i so excited immediately started playing it . one first tests i fuji finepix f31fd digital camera check how well it worked low light . i closed all blinds , turned off all lights , took picture items approximately 18 feet away . i took this picture night room pitch black . i amazed . picture came out clear it looked if it taken afternoon . you could not tell looking picture it taking completely dark room . second feature i wanted test face detection feature . so i took pictures me this feature turned off it turned . i pleasantly surprised results . while pictures not hugely different , it clear feature worked i more focus picture taken feature . this feature even worked when i took pictures dolls when i took picture picture several faces it . one feature i didn't think would all useful video capture feature . i love taking pictures but never into recording video . however since this feature included i find myself using it more more . it quick easy switch over video capture component record those precious moment . it limited approximately 15 minutes video which isn't great deal time . there supposed new memory card coming out soon allow users record longer periods video ( approximately 30 minutes ) . my husband keeps looking new memory card released but i'm fine approximately 15 minutes video approximately 350 pictures . what you love this product ? it compact easy handle . it lot great features including taking pictures dark , face recognition , video capture , ability let camera automate setting or let user manually adjust them , 2 sec 10 second timer , excellent zoom feature . i also like it warns you when you need make adjustments get best picture . example if i am zoomed closely auto focus work , it warm me . what you hate ? i not like software comes camera because 1 ) i think way it labels items awkward , 2)it seems all or nothing i.e. save all pictures or erase all pictures 3 ) it doesn't let you view before saving items , 4 ) it kind slow . maybe i just haven't learned use it correctly but doesn't work well me . i also not like i not use this webcam . i connect it my tv tuner view what happening my room but yahoo messenger not recognize it webcam . recommended : yes	1
tis best digital camera i owned or used . picture quality outstanding speed super fast . it so many options capabilities make it such great camera . face detection little slow i'm not sure if it makes much difference but i no complaints all . camera little pricey but i'm sure it give me years trouble free use . i also got 1gb type " " ( high speed ) card go it this combo fantastic	1
title this listing says its a80 g6 , but its only a80 . g6 uses ladc58d adapter	1
our kodak camera takes aa ( disposable ) batteries - this battery best so far we've used . highly recommended affordable	1
image stabilizer technology ( ) really works . around long time video camera but you could never see it work real time . you either turn it or off . these bino you just push button top , all shake stops . this not gimmick or sales hipe . i would not believed it unless i saw it myself . i used steiner 7x50s military other high quality optics , these little 10x30s beat all others my home use . pro's: ( ) really works . affordable . light weight . enclosed soft case fine . great value money . current rebate canon . con's: not water-proof . i would not want backpack these . overall : must buy !! fair weather sports , racing , birding , general home use . read reviews .	1
these binoculars not gadget but real advance . i am engineer first skeptical internal control system binoculars could really deliver enhancement seeing . however , i amazed their resolution first try . i view astronomical objects well animals . my first trial reading number tag high voltage line 500 yds away . unstabilized i could see yellow sign containing number but could not resolve it my eye ; soon i pressed stabilizer button sign easily readable ! second example , i noticed buck deer dozing fence 300 yds away but motion binoculars unstabilized not allow me count his points . press button , seven one side 6 other ! so even though resolution binoculars not change theoretically , mechanism , increases your hand held seeing resolution what i would say would factor 5 . this addition fact image not jiggle but remains locked view . works correspondingly well viewing star clusters , nebulae moon . no motion stars hand held	1
i've this device since 5/2006 relatively pleased results . video low light conditions not great , but outdoors video indoor/outdoor photos fine . though i hd television , i tend not view my videos it . i transfer video files my macbook pro view them quicktime player . i think video quality great just fact i instant access videos huge plus ! small size also great ... i just came back ski trip actually skiing filming same time ! you wouldn't big sony hd camera ! sanyo also told me sdhc ( high capacity ) cards also work this camera , so i intend buy 4g card very soon . amazon also sells some lens attachments sanyo come out i may look	1
after reading alot reviews here other places , everyone gave it ho-hum rating . i disagree , other things you take these grain salt . i just purchased mine 3 weeks ago i've already taken it two nascar races more importantly , las vegas weekend . it really proved itself vegas . i walked up down strip multiple times ( made few stops way ) this camera my pocket whole time . it never felt heavy or uncomfortable walking , standing or sitting . plus i could just take it out within few seconds take picture or movie many sights there . unless you're some sort videophile , this camera great . once you make few important settings , its rock solid . remember , its hd video 5mp camera ... it looks it . my requirements good video camera good still camera all one because i don't want carry 2 cameras i wanted something small sleek fit my pocket i don't want walk miles up down strip camera bag . this perfect ! price bit steep comparable sized units ( also sanyo ) , but i don't plan buying while thought hd would worth it . i opted 2gb card off bat it pretty inexpensive would hold plenty video ... it . i've found rarely anyone shoot anything hour straight ; it usually 1 min here , 4 min there , etc . only thing it doesn't night shooting , but ya can't everyhthing it takes fine pictures even little light . anyway , great camera	1
nikon d200 amazing camera . this review amazon packing procedures . this review alert prospective buyers amazon not pack these cameras well . i just purchased one it came packed like book , very little padding . i called nikon their recommendation return item pronto . i returned camera ( much trepidation)and purchase trusted source . just wanted give you all heads up	1
okay , let get few things out way : 1 . this case no belt loop . none . zip . nada . so it good protecting your camera while carried around pocket or purse , but you won't hanging this thing off your belt like batman . 2 . picture doesn't show it , but there hole top center " lid " case let wrist strap pass through . 3 . case white stitching . very classy , imho . 4 . round " bump " flap secures top lid case not snap closure , it magnet . intention here good it makes lid easy open without tug excessively case , but it double-edged sword because case also opened if it carried purse or bag any other object rub up against front case push magnetic flap up . so make sure this case sits solo , i guess . 5 . although case made genuine leather , it sure doesn't smell like it ; it smells like it buried ground black pepper month . pretty disappointing . all all , fujifilm sc-fxz1b leather camera case elegant well-crafted item ties z1 target user : fashion-minded occasional snapshooter carries ultra-compact camera more statement than necessity	1
this very flexible capable camera . if you looking more than point shoot offer , there very few would compare . me deciding factor high quality lieca lens wide angle , if you havent compared this directly conventianal lens you amazed what youve missing . 16:9 ok feature if you plan hdtv veiwing but screen size compromised when you switch 4:3 . i would prefer larger screen lose 16:9 feature . lens cap little annoying well but those issues aside , i am very satisfied	1
meets all expectations . questions noise greatly overblown . image stabilation reduces impact noise low light . people really expect get great image very low light condition ? regardless noise contrast too low get quality image except very special circumstances . up until last few years iso 400 film similar problems iso 800 virtually useless except get image . when i got this camera i took numerous pictures night inside got very good quality pictures without flash . far better than my old ditigal better than my film camera . lcd size image quality really impressive . best i seen	1
this camcorder awesome !! easy use instruction manual breaks things down you barney style :) battery only lets you record continuously 2 half hours ( more than i need ) so you may want standby battery waiting if it nessasary	1
if you want lens stays 24/7 while you chase your kids around ( carry their stuff altogether ) try take decent pictures , well this it . good every occasion , wedding landscape . every once while i look up new lenses wondering if it time get new one , but 18-200mm , one not make sense unless you time change lenses carry them . i am not pro , this lens my d70s i am way too happy . sometimes when i am out shooting pictures i hardly time change camera settings , i cannot imagine changing lens too . my other lenses cabinet . if you professional you may get 4 lenses better performances , i am sure . but i read reviews pros like this pricey toy too .	1
undoubtedly great achievement nikon offer this 18/200 range , very convenient carry . lower f/stop alternative would made this lens even more successful .	1
this works fine me - easy use light carry . if you filming mma or muay thai half cage , extend legs straight down , spike-style , otherwise some heavyweights clinch up topple onto your new tripod before you move bust one struts .	1
if you want catch something binoculars quickly without fooling around trying focus ... this it . we live lake we always something wild catch our eye . this very beneficial focus there all times . they bit bulky somewhat heavy but excellent pair binoculars . " shake " power not bad like we thought it would . i not say enough bushnell company . they support back their products like i never seen any other company . i always buy this brand now because this .	1
i purchased these because i don't like taking my $100 binoculars football games rock concerts . these perfect . optics little cheap , but $20 , i think it steal	1
bushnell powerview 12x25 fine , small pocket-sized binocular . since my wife avid bird watcher , we already several binoculars various sizes viewing power . our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 bushnell we used trips , so i researched , then bought this one amazon her birthday . she loves it . viewing power bit greater than other every bit compact , which makes it easy pack vacations , yet provides good viewing experience when enjoying various bird populations around country . we both highly recommend this , other bushnell products	1
small compact . let me see everyting i wanted	1
my sister considering telescope but unsure whether she should put out large amount money something she might not often use . i suggested orion starblast astro telescope way test waters first . telescope very inexpensive , yet reviews scope good . what i didn't expect how good this little telescope . saturn rings clear , hint cassini still nights . jupiter two primary bands clear well , globular clusters much brighter more resolved than you would believe possible scope this price ( don't expect glittering jewelry boxes though . ) scope well built , solid , yet lightweight . its incredibly easy use , view primary sweet spot bright clear . outside sweet spot images get distorted quickly , but this price small consideration . like rest scope , red dot finder easy use . my sister scope not jerkyness other reviewers reported , but i can't say whether we lucky or they weren't . i informal test whether first telescope any good : new owners put it closet after few frustrating attempts , or they developed growing fondness knowledge astronomy ? our case little starblast excelled this test . one prior reviewer asked why , telescope this good this price , everyone didn't telescope ? good question -- first scope , its well worth price . if you planning buy or give first scope , i wouldn't look any further . you still happily using this scope long after you move up larger , more powerful telescopes	1
i've orion starblast over year now , even though i larger , more sophisticated telescopes , it one i use most . setup instantaneous though , like other reflectors , it takes some time cool down cold nights . it easily portable , works well grab `n go . short focal length makes it excellent low power , wide field views deep sky objects moon . through starblast , i observed ( name few ) ring nebula , andromeda galaxy ( its two neighboring galaxies ) , galaxies m81 m82 , countless open clusters , lagoon trifid nebulas , eagle nebula , nebula orion , comets neat linear . jupiter belts moons apparent higher power , staurn rings phases venus mercury . during last opposition , i could see martian polar ice caps . during last lunar eclipse , i no trouble taking digital photographs through this instrument . this same fast optics formula edmund astroscan bushnell voyager bowling ball . starblast far away best three , but others , high power views soft . feature not problem those us primarily interested deep sky . planetary views could more detailed , my own starblast won't split double double suburban skies . ( orion somewhat longer 4.5 " 8 dobsonian more suited these subjects . ) addition , most globular clusters present unresolved fuzzy balls , they any instrument this aperture . price , though , you can't really beat starblast . it works well family telescope , or casual scope someone interested but not obsessed astronomy . it small , inexpensive , intuitive enough handled children . it also works nicely crusty old guys like me who bigger hardware , but just don't feel like moving it every night .	1

i bought this camera back-up my d2x so i wouldn't change lenses much trip i'm taking alaska this summer . well let me tell you , d200 18-200mm vr lens incredible . it fast , quiet pleasure use . i've read forums 18-200 little soft . so far i totally disagree , pictures i've taken very sharp . i wish this would available when i bought my d2x . if it , i would own two d200 instead one each . highly recommended !!	1
i recently recieved my new camera , i am thrilled . i researching which camera buy since december ( when our last camera went capoot ) . there mixed reviews olympus sw series , but could not resist appeal this camera unique features . i cannot wait take it into pool this summer kids . so far , point shoot options pictures lovely . any person screw up pictures any camera , but this camera so many features avoid . my husband i wonderful time taking extreme close up shots our garden . i not seen quality , much satisfaction camera since we first switched over digital . i am very pleased , say least , this purchase .	1
we bought one these items see how well it would work pictures kids grandma grandpa . it easy use , holds lot pics , nice picture quality , convenient size . we liked it so much we bought 2 more - 1 uncle living state 1 my wife keep her purse . well worth money not traditional pictures getting ruined your wallet	1
i read all reviews considered other possibilities , but this far least expensive most needed features it intended use . viewer works others mentioned taking limitations ( no indexing ) into account still very worthwhile tool . what i could fiond out imnag es ordered software according date picture taken . i haven't delved into manner which one could change dates enable arranging images group subject matter , or what ever groupings one would want . my use take images trip visit relatives show them others back here home . it works very well this prupose . compare prices , say , ipod or such .	1
versatile tripod low price , light weight , sleek design , compact retracted mode , allows great stills almost any position	1

i wanted good quality consumer grade digital camera take short trips , so i purchased this one . i think quality picures very good it most features i wanted . it few dollars more than i really wanted spend , but all all i am pleased . my main complaint battery life little short side , it takes while see photo you just took lcd screen . i really want something hold me two years , then these things twice good fraction cost . now it what i need it pretty well	1
i used nikkon d70 before i bought this one . advantage this camera i dont change lens again again . it includes both wide angle telephoto lens . addition still image , this camera also video feature . so i capture video too . i bought this camera before my niagara vacation . so , i took lots wonderful picture niagara i also video . so , this works me much better	1
i just bought this camera , i think it really great . lcds lens what sold me , they're everything i hoped . very high quality camera . feels solid , all components well made . pictures amazing ( see my posted pics ) . i don't think you need pro use this camera , but features all there those wanting manual control	1
initial impressions new super-zoom olympus camera excellent . thought i'd like view finder , opposed just screen back camera , but digital image view finder isn't crisp i'd like . relatively small fault . still learning use all features	1
i got camera week ago highly recommend it . if you buy this camera , i recommend getting type card which much faster than type taking pictures . some movie functions not work full capability type but faster type . i also recommend getting nimh 2700 mah batteries charger . their higher capacity worth money save over long run . far camera goes , i wish camera higher than 7.1 mp , but compared my old 3.3 mp camera , pictures so much clearer finer . camera many functions build , you need read manual get full use camera . out box auto mode works well , but after reading manual , i think most higher end users want set their own modes . some nice included functions manual ability , ability choose among 15 different shooting types ( such through window ) , ability store raw images among others . storing raw images slow due large file size take several seconds type card . movie mode able take 30 fps 640x480 , but 15 fps still good quality . type card you only take 15 seconds movies full mode , but type you fill your memory card . default setting movies without sound so you need turn this . however , sound turned , i not able zoom , even card . image stablization nicely setup set just push button rather than going through menu . also , eyepiece viewfinder setup so if display back , viewfinder off vice-versa . fact when you use eyepiece viewfinder , picture normally displayed back now eyepiece . i suppose this good taking pictures when it too bright see back screen . finally , i like take weather shots this camera includes time lapse mode , which i put together my old software ( not olympus ) into movie . [ ... ]	1
i camera 5 months now . i great time learning use it . easy use takes good pictures . only negative nighttime fireworks setting not greatest , but still pretty deciet	1
this supposedly entry level digital camera , but i already found more cool bells whistles than i ever use . since most my photography performance horses , i very interested how camera would handle motion pictures . " sports " mode stops them their tracks totally terrific resolution . it very easy operate screen menus really effortless use . only thing i am diappointed strap carrying . it so flimsy useless .	1
hp camera very easy use takes great pictures , its small enough carry comfortable but not feel fragil	1
great picture quality very easy use . auto picture one best i seen . only con display not bright enough see under sunlight	1
this my first digital camera after using slr ( film ) camera last 15 years . i'm very happy z710 , quality photos , ease use selection features . other reviewers said it well i could . i tried few test photos , zooms , sports , etc . photos came out clear distinct , even under conditions swift movement . important point me ability use rechargeable batteries , which z710 . so there no dependency expensive throwaway batteries . i would prefered digital slr camera , but think i satisified z710 until day finally comes . one thing i miss ability experiment different filters . that worst thing i say camera . but few things i didn't like which nothing photo quality : 1 ) accompanying software ( once installed ) started each time system boots . i would prefer start it myself when i need it , but this option doesn't seem available . 2 ) video sequences filmed quicktime ( . mov ) format . i would preferred more accessible format ( avi ) which i could burn directly onto video cds . i still test more , but video sequences seemed not smooth they might , especially after converting them avis . i realized this might general artifact videos produced via digital cameras . general , it great value money , i would recommend it anyone market digital camera	1
i've using it couple days , i love it . harddisk gift , once you get used it , you'll never believe you've using tape before . usb 2.0 transfer your computer works like charm it pretty quick even very large files , also because video file types mpeg , dvd authoring software doesn't take forever compile dvd , it very quickly . there couple simple , yet powerful editing using camcorder itself . interface pretty intuitive , touch screen very usable even my thick thumbs . video picture quality excellent medium light , ok low light ' far better than my previous canon zr70 though ' . stand still camera simply top notch , compared my current sony p8 . i love slow motion feature , unfortunately it only capture couple seconds , also taking photos while you're video taping great , but you only take couple photos during shooting videos . all all , i'm very happy all it features , also surround sound works pretty well . i didn't give it 5 stars because camera doesn't come usb port , or video output options camera itself , i dock it docking station then connect it my pc , which leaves me choice either put docking station beside my pc move files , or beside my hd tv watch movies camera , not sure why sony least didn't put usb port camera directly , pretty annoying ! also , there no way capture video using this camera , although kind standard feature any cheap mini dv cameras , now i think getting video capture card my computer if i need copy any my recorder programs my dvrs or previous tapes dvd !	1
i went into local camera store look nikon 12-24mm wide angle zoom eventually augment nikon 50mm 1.8 18-200mm vr i currently use my d200 . after seeing sigma 10-20mm , taking test shots it nikon , then printing shots store , i walked out sigma lens . i planned buy 12-24mm nikon next spring when my budget would allow expenditure . i success nikon optics past - starting my first nikon fm back seventies . sigma good construction , nice finish , smooth+fast+quiet focusing 10mm focal length convinced me try my first non-nikon lens 30 years . big factor : sigma lens less than half price nikon lens here canada . it fit my budget , so i took plunge . sigma fits into my " sharp enough " category . real world shooting , its sharpness par my 18-200mm nikon . both lens less sharp than my $100 50mm 1.8 when " test " images blown up 16 " x20 " size . i never notice any lack sharpness " real " pictures . i care more color saturation , contrast color balance anyway . this area , sigma well . saturation contrast equal both my other nikon lens - particularly f8 smaller aperatures . wide open , i find some weakening contrast . sigma warmer color termperature than my other lens . one click toward blue photoshop would fix this minor variance color . but i use my 10-20mm almost exclusively landscapes . warmer color generally good thing . i noticed some vignetting @ 10mm f4 . zooming 12mm or stopping down 5.6 elminates any artifacts pictures i taken thus far . i found it more important avoid " thick framed " filters - stacking filters no no this lens . they cause more darkening than wide open f-stop . btw : i added 72 77mm step-up ring my 18-200m vr nikon allow me share filters my zoom lens . i miss manual/autofocus switch sigma lens . i accidently nudged manual focus ring couple times . said , incredible depth field this lens ( or any lens this focal length ) means small focusing errors tolerated :) i recommend this lens - even people like me , who never non-nikon lens before .	1
i got my mb-d200 last fall after more than 6 months using it i should say nikon created winner yet again !!! good : 1 . ability 2 fully charged batteries while going out field gives you extra peace mind . 2 . addition nikon added menu give shooter very good indication battery power remaining . i able get more than 200 shots day starting out 2 fully charged batteries mb-d200 . 3 . weight increase very minimal fact meager increase weight enables shooter balance camera better . 4 . it very thoughtful nikon add shutter release buttons taking portrait shots main sub command dials , mb-d200 . i find myself using these controls quite frequently . if user revert controls camera it would quite frustrating imho . 5 . if you nature/landscape/wildlife photographer , you carry additional aa batteries you field rest assured you won't miss out " kodak moment " due drained battery . some suggestions improvement : 1 . first thing i noticed latch battery compartment . it feels quite flimsy i wish nikon better job this . latch lines one found camera release door compact flash card would solid imho . 2 . though i mentioned you use aa batteries ( you need 6 them ) , they drain out amazingly fast , depending type lens ( or without vr ) , depending whether you using in-built or external flash other variables . so you need quite few aa batteries if you ever rely them field . overcome this problem i am thinking purchasing 2 more en-el3e batteries i found they impressive battery life once fully charged . hope this review useful you ! thanks reading	1
ever since my first purchase my mb-d100 battery pack ( my nikon d100 dslr ) i made it point get one every new dslr i purchased . i believe i even got one my nikon n65 film slr way back when . i currently d100 , d80 d200 they all equipped corresponding battery pack . let face it , d200 battery hog ! maybe 650-700 shots per battery less if you auto preview or preview each shot . mind , dual battery compartment makes this battery hog shoot forever ! when i shoot weddings , i work all day take nothing short 10gb photos there still juice it when we leave ... impressive . i change my batteries half way through day out " principality " more reliability but if you pinch , you just throw 6 aa batteries backup holster slide into compartment . we all know aas bought almost everywhere so you always shoot ! most crucial part this battery pack side shutter release button . no longer you uncomfortably twist turn your right hand strenuous angles if you want compose vertical shot . when you turn your camera sideways , extra shutter release button right there where you used . when paired shutter aperture command dials you ready go quickly efficiently . comfort factor huge this grip . grip fits into your hand like glove very sturdy stable when mounted camera itself . i swear i could hold my camera one well placed finger battery grip ! i notice my wife co-photographer bit trouble couping sheer weight this camera + battery pack but after dealing it shooting , she quickly adjusted now fell love packs well . other features grip nice but not essential such af lock such ... well nikon	1
d-200 great camera but unlike d-100 single battery used camera doesn't last very long charges . multi-power battery pack correct problem-two batteries instead one it also give camera better feel when handling . i love it .	1
nice scope , feels hefty appears well made . glass optics good light gathering abilities . large objective lense nice metal screw lense protector . only drawback i found battery compartment tiny kind hard screw battery cap	1
great product panasonic . this my first digital camcorder i am very pleased quality . used it research fiddler crabs , needed zoom picture quality it excellent . picture crystal clear i took shots 7-8 feet away zoomed max . it also picks up sound even whisper great feature needed . easy use easy transfer video tv viewing	1
well , i it . i finally bought digital camera . don't tell anyone , but i didn't buy it here . canon s1is gone lot places me , always exactly what i want it , flawlessly . it gone ocean , bowling alley , numerous hikes , burning man , mountains , work .. performed like pro . me , controls laid out very logically , it easy me turn off flash when i want take night shot . after few days manual , using camera regularly , menu options became familiar . those us who like self portraiture , lcd screen swivels turns around all way perfect , you set up your self portrait easily . i love black white sepia modes too . taking video this canon , even night , easy . only hitch i seen you cannot zoom very close , otherwise camera cannot possibly keep up keeping video focus ... this easily solved my tripod . sum up : i am so glad i bought this camera my first digital . it perfect me , we very happy together . now i am eyeing smaller canon i slip my pocket . but sssshhhhh , don't tell my s1is	1
i bought this camera last year i'm very satisfied whit it , it incredible resolution good color , saturation quality pictures , you must atention low light condition but rest its great camera very sofisticated when i more money i buy s2	1
i love this rangefinder- much better than type shoots prism flag sticks . you use this one find yardage bunkers , creeks , etc . very accurate very useful . well worth money	1
i got nikon laser rangefinder chrisymas it 8x magnification . i found this powerful golf . i could not hold it steady flag . 6x magnification bushnell yardage pro scout much better . also it very compact stores easily my golf cart . price amazon well below i could find anywhere else .	1
i used this snorkeling grand cayman it fantastic ! easy use , make sure you read instructions seal gasket properly . don't afraid handle it , just put little sealant your forefinger thumb coat it well . getting gasket easy , taking it out ... well ... honest , not . look little area stick something in-between plastic housing ring pop it out ( it not easy , maybe plastic tooth pick ? ) . not use anything damage ring or housing !, if you , very careful . don't forget diffuser ! it works great flash . also , keep diffuser hold it your hand if you must but use it take better portraits , flash simply much this make your portraits much better ( look skin tones after using it ) i wish this camera way clip this diffuser it without case . i didn't buy weights but wish i . camera floats easily , i would get it next time . also , learn buttons well before you go , really get them your memory , its not easy remember them when you're underwater moving around .	1
i loved this - it perfect me . i'm not diver , so i don't know how it would hold up greater depth , but i took it snorkeling ( looks spelled wrong , but i'm not sure , but oh well ) got incredible pictures videos . it also allowed me take it kayaking without paranoid , so it great me .	1
this case nice , but i think expanding sides unnecessary . camera easily slide out out unzipping sides , except elastic strap usually pop up flash when you put camera , then same strap won't let go flash when you pull it out ... unless you unzip all zippers pull it apart . this still best case this camera though , long you don't want carry extra batteries , sd cards , etc .	1
ideal case panasonic ps-slx2 . easy open / close , sturdy nice design . highly recommended	1
money i spent this charger money well spent , i replace my original after my dog decided she needed new chew toy .	1
this camera great ! not only it take great digital photos extremely user friendly , but if you add 1gb memory card it ( which slides right only costs $40.00 ) you take lot great quality digital videos sound very easy upload your computer and/or internet email family etc . fact , there no need buy video camera when you this it fits right your pocket . i take up 30 minute videos lots photos one time . you easily take photo while you making video well	1
i used camera three months , absolutely love it ! pictures crisp ( even very close-ups ) , video feature right up there . sound pick-up excellent . i created two dvd combining videos still pictures . folks thought quality very good . battery life rated very good , i found this true . i carry camera me nearly everywhere i go . people impressed size . drawbacks ? because its size , there no connections camera computer , tv or battery charger . docking station small lightweight . because battery life , i never away home long enough need recharging . i recommend camera without reservations , look first casio future	1
i many traditional film slrs including original pentax k1000 ( fully manual ) , canon rebel xos canon elph . when considering digital slr cameras canon digital rebel point-and-shoot canon digital elph top my list . but $150 less than canon digital elph , casio exilim ex-s series better buy same features ( some cases better execution same features ) . if you're looking fun point-and-click camera record audio , avi movie files digital pictures this it . it takes 15 miuntes read manual you're off taking pictures . pay attention when reading manual everything else seem very intuitive . all cameras i i use this one most often . other users complained proprietary lithium ion battery but 3rd party equivalents available right here amazon site , you just look . my back-up battery only [ ... ] bucks . san disk 1gb memory cards cheap too , [ ... ] online , [ ... ] retail . last , i agree many users lock switch needs developed so you keep camera accidentally turning when it your pocket -- but remember many cameras this problem/lack/this feature . i solved my own issues buying [ ... ] case belt loop	1
this ac adapter sure saves batteries . although it not device use wilds it sure handy use your home photography work shop . it could setup permanent location handy you where it could stored(wound hung)on wall hook , easily accessible whenever need arises . i use mine fairly frequently	1
camera fits perfectly space front pouch extra battery memory card	1
1 . easily accessible menus change camera settings . less used settings deeper menus . one touch flash control nice . 2 . lcd good size framing shots reviewing . 3 . accessing downloading images not require use included cd software . just plug into usb slot [ either win2k or xp ] pc enumerates camera drive . this good those us who other imaging editing software don't want install basic nikon package . 4 . must taken over hundred shots charged pair nimh batteries . 5 . image pixel resolution programmable . 3mp very clear viewing printing . 6 . works fine 1gb sd card ; max spec'ed user guide . 7 . others mentioned , fact lens extends anytime camera turned problem . i originally bought soft case it found lens extended one time when i went take it out . error message screen . power button must gotten pressed . got hard case after . over all good size , feature set , battery life .	1
i just received sd750 my birthday ( thanks mom dad ! ) . i've it several days taken over 3 hundred pictures tons video . it now replaces my old canon s400 , which replacement my antique canon s110 . i've remained true canon because i see amount work they put into making each new generation cameras " much better . " first , colors so much crisper sd750 than prior models , although some tweeking may needed , you always find setting capture color you after . second , video quality outstanding ( highest setting , ) , canon finally took off 3 minute cap video recording allow longer videos . also , highest setting only , you zoom out while recording video . i love 3 inch display incorporates shifting orientation so picture always upright . i wish camera came more powerful optical zoom ... but i imagine i'll get next generation . end , i emphasize , this camera takes oustanding pictures . that what camera should , after all . now quick rundown improvements previous models ( you canon loyalists ): - much improved color- faster picture taking faster everything- extended video capacity ( however much memory ya got)- large lcd appease instant gratification generation- overall improved picture quality ( clarity , color saturation)a few small camera quirks outside picture quality ... jog dial back ( trying emulate ipod ) not smartest addition " play " button little hard hit times . overall , i definitely without hesitation recommend this camera	1
i purchased this product after doing quite bit research . i am big fan canon cameras but recently there some other really good competitors . i bought this one take me everywhere . it almost perfect . size just right . it fits nicely into my pocket or easily into my wife purse . face recognition great feature seems work very well . start-up time time take picture extremely fast accurate . it would nice more powerful optical zoom , little lip one side make holding while taking picture easier . this well built high quality camera i would purchase again second	1
good telescope . i would suggest buying extra lenses ( only two others available this model ) . very light easy travel	1
excellent . upgraded yardage pro 400 . this one so small . much more convenient than 400 . this one just clips your bag . works better well . even picks up those flags just hanging there overcast , windless day . scan feature nice verify you zoning proper target	1
firstly , i love its black all-metal body . i also love its ergonomics size . i've own other digital p/s slrs . they all good cameras , but big size . i tend bring l60 me everywhere i go ( e.g. biking , hiking , etc . ) convenience . inside , it also beautiful . i've ordered prints upto 11x14 they turned out beautiful . using 2gb sd card , it also allowed me record more than 1.5 hours 640x480 video mpeg4 30 fps . if you need small , robust camera you take everywhere you go still takes beautiful pictures , this it	1
i gave this xmas gift my 14-yr-old daughter she loves it . super easy use . good idea get backup battery if you're like her forget charge it sometimes . big selling bonus it thin enough fit into her pocket	1
i purchased second sony vct870rm tripod use separate video cameras because ease setup stability operation . quality construction supports lot good use . eldon wolf - albany ,	1
i got this frame gift my parents after returning different one . quality good it easy use . only thing i would improve there no usb input so you need card reader . overall i would recommend it friends	1
it great product , very easy operate , great size , accepts all my flash card formats . but resolution could better plastic back ( ok , no one look back picture frame ) looks cheap . compared other products i know , i still think it great one	1
if nothing else you get neutral protection you get polarized may or may not work well , but only $17 . i thought it worth it	1
it holds my camera nicely so lcd not get scratched my pocket . camera easy access stays tightly clipped your belt even when hiking . my wife thinks i'm dork wearing camera but we lot great photos camera always me .	1
this not only ideal scope beginners but enough instrument show you new things sky years come . it sturdy simple operate . it enough light-gathering power ( more important than magnification ) reveal dim star clusters , nebulae , galaxies good enough optics show you surface planets like jupiter , saturn , mars . affordable this scope , there no reason give so much glance numerous trashy 60mm refractors exaggerated magnification claims litter market . some advice selection . dobsonians like this one come range sizes . 114mm ( 4 � " ) bit small side but still fine instrument , especially if your ability carry large objects limited . 150-200mm ( 6-8 " ) scope like this one middle recommended range . 250mm ( 10 " ) big side , you should buy one only if you able-bodied . some advice use . viewing through telescope less like playing cd more like playing guitar . finding objects takes little bit practice . simplify finding , i would suggest replacing supplied finder orion superior 8x40 model also supplementing it " red dot " finder ; both available amazon . you also need buy atlas ( sky telescope pocket sky atlas best available ) , red flashlight view charts without blowing out your badly-needed night vision , guidebook lead you interesting objects . these investments greatly add your enjoyment . what more i say ? this kind scope experienced observers trying steer novices towards decades . although , i recommend you your homework before buying any scope -- learn sky get know experienced stargazers who advise you -- when it comes time purchase , you could hardly better than this scope . more advice , see my encyclopedic guide here amazon , " so you want buy telescope .	1
found lens very useful , actually find only minor faults , which not even worth mentioning . considering purchasing wide angle lens supplement my picture taking . would recommend purchasing both	1
i received lens timely manner am very pleased it . thanks provider	1
our camcoder not holding charge . online search found what we needed amazon . placed order received quickly . exact fit our camcorder . camcorder working fine now . thanks	1
i bought this camera after owning olympus digital camera years . i extremely happy my olympus , but wanted something smaller would fit my purse or diaper bag since i'm expecting . this camera such disappointment . just every single picture i took huge white blobs all over it . ( this only happened when using flash . i must admit camera takes great pictures broad daylight without flash . ) plus , if you used zoom all , pictures came out fuzzy . first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! store i bought camera wouldn't take it back because i waited two days past 14-day return policy . so , i sold camera took $100 loss . i'd much rather lose $[ ... ] than keep this camera	-1
this why sony hot ! this sexy little ( yes its really small size pack cards ) it takes perfect clear crisp pictures battery life long 320mins perfect vacation , make sure get memory stick it though , because w/o it it only holds 15 pics . this my first digital camera i would definitely buy sony again	1
i am just average guy when it comes using camera . probably below average . i started trying use 100% sony electronic products because my computer sony sony-sony linkages make easy use . given , here what i think product : 1 . it amazing how much camera you get money . compared just 6 months ago , or year ago , this lot camera money . it very small , fits easily your pocket , but takes great pictures . also , it very easy use recharge . 2 . visit sony website , suggests sony new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras very similar . this makes it hard compare cameras , even within sony brand , makes you feel if your camera obsolete minute you buy it . 3 . problem this camera , given it so small -- not shake . your pictures blurry . i am typical guy , very little fine motor control . my hands trouble holding small objects . holding this camera one hand taking picture -- well results not pleasant . 4 . i tend disappointed telephoto capabilities these small cameras . i guess if you really want zoom , then you go big camera . but it still seems like small cameras could offer more . 5 . said all , end , this camera small easy carry , light weight , durable , it also easy use . when you look it , it looks well made . i ended up giving camera my in-laws , because they lost theirs . my in-laws tend technologically challenged . i said them , just leave dial set little green camera , snap away . i say - they love this camera . overall . money , great purchase , technology amazing . just grab it two hands or develop steadier aim than i .	1
first all , i just looking decent camera ~ $200 took good clean pictures 6x zoom . i narrowed it down canon a710 this . since i didn't need few extra features canon , i went cheaper lz7 although i some reservations , i'm very happy my decision . i primarily use camera taking pictures my pets , family get togethers wildlife/nature pictures while hiking ... i've camera two months . pros : simple use , image stabilization works great , takes aa so you'll never run out batery power , there several different image size settings change accomadate use extended zoom ( up 9x . regular 6x ) , manual exposure controls , nice bright screen , battery life excellent using nimh batteries , price everything comes it . cons : there lag when flash used , but i think this common all cameras don't use lithium battery ; there no view finder although i haven't encountered situation where i've wanted one ; size little large " pocket camera " but any camera 6x optical zoom , it really not bad . i haven't really used camera nigh t-t ime party type shots , which i'm guessing would not problem . i also not used video capabilities , which based claims should excellent . overall , $200 , you'd hard pressed find 7 megapixel , 6x optical zoom camera excellent image stablization , excellent picture taking capabilities . seven years ago , i paid $180 1.8 megapixel fugi no zoom ... this camera awesome deal !	1
this camera shoots gorgeous pics movies . i picked it after some pretty intensive research . i wanted camera would capture all pics even low light stabilizer would give me steady pics even if person holding it shaky hands . i also wanted it so simple it icons obvious . ( other words , camera " point shoot " challenged . ) i wanted it easy get cheap batteries ( double a)and memory card ( my 2 gig sdm cost $29 ) i also wanted it download right my pictbridge printer event i didn't want power up my pc . just make it really fun , i wanted all this less than $250 . it deliver ? oh yeah	1
hey , whats really say , but it it job . i dig ilink because i hook it up my tv watch my minidv tapes my camcorder just this one cable ! also i use it my sony dvd recorder make dvd my camcorder . just one cable ... kool	1
i highly recommend this item sony handycams . i used belkin while , but this tops it over over . i can't tell you why but my video upload my handycam my computer lightning fast now i love it . thanks sony	1
i bought this camera my wife christmas 06 . she small canon point shoot great . she wanted something more zoom other features so she could take her photography level . this great camera ! controls well placed easy use . it tons pre-sets various settings etc . pictures very sharp . only thing my wife not sure first cameras size . she so loved way camera works pictures it produces she willing live it size . i think this camera going classic - gives slrs run money .	1
i am very impressed this flash excellent way camera controls it . inside it zooms match lens-view , which very impressive feature . exposure together flash dead-on my p880 which also lets me use built-in flash little extra fill ! recycle time also great flash only uses 2 batteries . i believe it based sunpak pz-40x series flash made non-kodak cameras . compared other manufactures flash pricing , full mrsp pretty decent current pricing great deal ! while this not marketed professional equipment , it enable you create top-notch indoor flash photos . you may consider getting sto-fen omnibounce it enable you diffuse light little bit bounce situations .	1
this lens great value . feels well constructed , opitical quality good(could better but not price range ) . it great beginers or amatuers . used lens 1 year no problems it . great range , 28mm very wide 35mm format cameras . great walk around lens . canon also amazing online customer support	1
bushnell pinseeker 1500 rangefinder ( non-slope model ) easy use constructed elements . after using pinseeker few rounds i quickly learned how focus acquire desired target matter seconds . i walk up my ball i pull out rangefinder , acquire target , put it back case hit shot without adding more then 10 seconds my preshot routine . this rangefinder most definately game improvement device helped me select right club , many cases made me aware i needed change clubs . my opinion it better then gps devices whereas you must course loaded or manually enter course info beforehand . if you ride golf car gps subject cart path only , then point where your ball lies only estimate actual yardage . pinseeker go any course world used immediately any part course . if you looking device help club selection game imporvement , then i would highly recommend pinseeker 1500 .	1
i really like this camera . it 10x optical , image stabilization , 3.0 inch lcd 230,000 pixels , more . size great 10x zoom camera . image stabilization great getting shots would come out blurry my canon powershot a620 . my other favorite feature besides zoom image stabilization , wide angle . it great finally get cityscapes whole skyline one shot !! camera set 16x9 , i get 24mm shot ! what i don't like this camera it short battery life . even the1300mah battery i bought , i get less shots than my canon . colors photos this camera lot less colorful than canon . something i get used . i very disappointed find out this camera no zoom movie mode , unlike its predecessor , tz1 . luckily , not stop me buying this camera . overall , this camera great buy , especially if you want i.s. wide angle , long zoom	1
i just received dmc-tz3a . i love this camera . this my first camera ever . i love features , build quality , menu system . i am still getting used learning how take quality pictures . example , i trouble getting it focus times . i am certain this just learning curve me . one feature i am disappointed it lacks - auto retraction lens when playback mode . most other cameras automatically retract lens protect it when viewing pictures camera . this one not this you turn camera off get it retract . i really wish they would update firmware support this important safety feature . all-in-all i definitely recommend this camera	1
lit shot properly , footage this camera 24p mode come very close 16mm film . this fantastic camera price , this new model worked out lot kinks earlier models . those you looking xl2 , it true this camera not interchangeable lens ( although wide-angle telephoto adapters available ) but camera feels more compact robust , more features ( like xlr ) built right into camera body vs . external attachments .	1

i've bought this camera year ago i am very happy it . batery charges fast lasts long , movies good quality ( clear , not blured , colors come out exactly same ) camera light enough . only problem i've so far you cannot record dark - movie comes out darker than it seemed you hardly see anything . otherwise i am more than happy camera	1
long story short , i 12 years experence personal security training consulting business . i install two or three these units outside every one my urban customers homes . commonly my customers problems their neihborhoods home break-ins , agressive vagrants , threats their dogs or restraining orders . i watch deterent effect these fake cameras these types people via real video capture cameras nearby all time . they often cross street or sheild there face they pass fake cameras . my customers advise me regular basis they see deterent effect all time . just spoke single female customer tonight who advises her agressive vagrant problem she her back street two years solved my install one these her back garage . she me installing two more these svat isc200 next week . you decrease chance your home invaded significantly installing these . best security deterent item you could add your home price , period ! you increase effectiveness printing out small little sign red black ink placing it under camera , warning they recorded . i usely use " smile ! you monitored recorded remote location ! " . if you plan placing real camera somewhere public access , put one these up first 30 days insure it not damaged . also use these " damage bait cameras " near real ones reduce chance getting real one damaged . check you fake cameras once week insure no one damaged it . you should also add few " beware dog " " no solicitors " signs homedept/lowes your gates near your front door ( regardless if you dog or not . ) . might not pretty , but combined fake cameras , creates significant deterance factor against all bad people . plan change batteries every 2-3 months . difficult get thing screw back once mounted , difficult get innner " camera " re-align when it pops out , i've recieved few doa ( thus , 4 out 5 star rating ) . hope this helps ! ( sorry spelling errors !	1
we've used lenmar rechargeables other digicams great results , so it no-brainer pick up this crv3 compatible battery new olympus camera . 1350 mah battery comes charging base two electric adapters ( wall outlet car cigarette lighter which not shown picture ) . nice plus choosing this lithium battery weighs less than pair nimh aa batteries yet it runs cooler so camera doesn't get too warm . battery charges few hours lasts quite while charges . we able shoot several hundred shots over multiple sessions without fully draining battery . only quibble we this charger related directions found one page instruction sheet : " once battery fully charged , promptly remove battery charger . note : not leave battery charger prolonged periods after battery fully recharged . " this battery can't left charging overnight ; it must monitored manually removed when cycle complete . why couldn't lenmar put auto-shutoff circuitry charger when light turns green just like their other chargers	1
it nice camera easy carry it fit your pocket i am satisfie	1
i several pocket digital cameras but this excellent . easy use i wanted longer zoom , this true 5x optical zoom . pictures came out very good battery life very good . my only complaint screen very hard see bright sunlight , but i think all cameras this range without viewfinder same problem . also , price great . i would recommend this camera i like blue color- it different rest	1
we bought this " swimming dolphins " excursion our honeymoon cruise it worked perfectly ! it easy set up , easy use , easy clean . i only wish we more opportunity use it , but pictures we get great	1
this case everything it advertized . i know ya can't scuba it , but i'm not diver so it doesn't bother me . i live hawaii , home wettest place earth , i use this thing almost daily . it very nice not worry your camera . it effectively keeps out rain , ocean , sand ( that really important one ) everything else . its fun watch all stupid tourists trying run down beach , snap their pics , then run away before they get wet , or wading into waterfall knee deep snap some pics . this case , you just jump right not worry . trust me , taking pics those funny tourists water fun hobby mine . update -- 5/31/06my o-ring bit " loose " some time . i still get it close watertight long i pay lot attention when i am shutting case make sure seal doesn't get pinched . canon offer replacement through canon parts , but it 16 bucks $7 shipping . i bought one intent examining it figuring out how make bunch new ones much cheaper . after all , it just piece rubber -- can't hard . i repost information if i am successful	1
this case works well camera , but elastic straps releasing flash significant design error . placing camera lens facing back case works much better . belt loop only measures 1.25 inches effectively , so it not work all belts . all all , case protect camera , which why i bought it	1
ideal case panasonic ps-slx2 . easy open / close , sturdy nice design . highly recommended	1
this foldout-prong charger came my canon camera functions perfectly . however , travel i prefer canon cb-5l which same except long cord rather than prongs . why ? because plugged-in cg-580 too easy forget when you check out hotel room . ( i forgot similar item once . ) yes , cb-5l cord bulkier , but i never carry battery charger my camera bag anyway . cord means i perform gymnastics only once during stay inexpensive european hotels where electrical outlets oddly placed . also , foreign outlets sometimes deeply recessed , even plug adapter , appliances plug flush wall may not connect all way unless you stack adapters . both units dual voltage , so that not problem . listen voice experience . .	1
i love my new camera !!! this my first video camera there definitely no buyers remorse here . it soooo user friendly ! i researched many cameras found this one most suitable my needs . my company subcontracted work production company my camera ( pv-gs250 ) used secondary camera b-roll it fabulous . footage almost seamless two cameras when it edited . i'm very happy my purchase look forward using it more more	1

easy get up running , unit goes into slideshow mode after power automatically . picture quality excellent . easy put pictures memory card them show up . recommend re-cropping your pictures 16x9 aspect ratio so you get full picture . unit accomodate std . 4x6 format well , but not fill screen . small quirks : - when slideshow mode , you can't hit pause button zoom . - very poorly designed stand collapse after couple weeks . - documentation lacking ( typical coby style ) - no support quicktime video popular some digital cameras - unit faint lingering glow screen after power down which doesn't go away unless you unplug unit	1
i just received my coby dig . frame . put 25 pics memory chip stuck into device . pressed slide show it started working . minimum frame time 5 seconds i wish it faster my needs ( window display gallery ) , color not perfect , but it only $107 . so i'll live it	1
we canon powershot s50 3 years ago , loved it . so this time when my husband wanted buy digital compact camera , we specifically looked canons . we originally thinking getting sd 700,800 or something like . but after we compared these cameras together store near us . we found out sd900 finest lcd display , more opitions control panel ... so we came back bought it amazon ( our favorite online store ) . we used it our last trip grand cayon , lv , sf etc . this sd900 takes very good pictures , especially good lighting conditions . colors also smooth rich . downside , you may already read others ' reviews , no battery indication , no raw(it ok , my husband doesn't much editiing anyway , it too much ask campact camera offer ) , control panel sensitive ... don't get frustrated if you happened pressed wrong button couldn't figure way out during time shooting . stich great function which comes , but when very bright area , you not see stich alignment very well lcd screen ( i guess it common trouble all digital compact cameras which relay lcd dispay ) . overall , it wonderful camera , we love it . it my husband camera , i uses canon 350d , but i borrow it my husband sometimes because it tiny compares my 10 lbs " moose " it takes very good pictures .	1
this camera takes great pictures all time . i haven't one picture turned out bad . it also very easy use there lots fun things you it . i would recommend this camera anyone	1

i bought this camera my daughter pretty impressed . it easy use , takes great pictures , lot options , very small ( pocket-sized ) . fact it kind depressing because i paid $250 5mp this time last year . you need memory card this camera . internal memory only holds 3 pics highest res . 1 gb which hold 400 pics . only thing i would warn you : if you try use used memory card , you need format it camera though menu , or windows , befor you use it . i tried use one my old camera transfer software wouldn't work two different computers , it kept saying " enumerating " never read pics . after formatting card , it fine . also , this camera claims support only specific sd cards sandisk , panasonic toshiba , which weird because i thought sd standard . see page 102 manual	1

this good battery canon digital cameras . this cta digital db-nb4l battery original canon batery both used take digital photos during recent mexican cruise . this cta digital battery worked well .	1
first off , let me make it clear i am satisfied this camera . i it 8 months now i put it through its paces its held up fine . but there few things you must know : camera no zoom . i mean , practically no zoom . 2.2 may look decent but its pointless any real-life situation . you find yourself moving lot your camera get better shot , not standing one place using zoom feature . you never get close wide shot - its just not possible this camera . this camera great average stills but that it . you click twice take picture or " press halfway then fully " according manual . this major pain . sometimes when battery weak , it may take lot time take picture ( lot frustration ) , so this not cam capture any special pictures or " kodak moments " . apart these cons , camera great value money offers video all kinds stuff . if you're looking mostly looking take landscape or portrait stills , this camera good job	1
cute , compact , easy use - these just few ways describe canon cool a400 ! this stylish digital camera lightweight perfect snapping shots go . mine sunset gold . plus , there perks like macro mode ( which lets you snap sharp pictures close 2 inches ) , lots shooting modes ( like snow fireworks ) . movie mode lets you capture video clips sound . this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . just what you would expect canon	1
got this almost year ago it completely changed way my photographs . amazing light most indoor photographs . i got product shots , abstract shots fantastic portraits using this great unit . definitely recommended anyone who wants shoot anything indoor .	1
this great purchase my purposes - birding wildlifing . i get used turning center-focus ring finger , zoom lever index-finger position . use full zoom , you really need total stability , but half zoom very useful even moving kayak . right-eye focus ring right up against eyecups hard move unless you twist open eyecups , which case focus ring fine . focus crispness not quite what i hoped full zoom , but still good seeing field marks . one big advantage light weight . this set light smaller nikon i lost . very nice	1
binoculars past either way too expensive or too cheap , i wanted new pair would replace pair loaned out , then lost . opportunity presented itself form trip canada this past september , which required something would able capture canadian rocky vistas , but also not so heavy i would feel like needing cart stow them . nikon eagleview binoculars seem fill bill ( not too expensive , but also not too heavy ) . they great zoom feature easily changed well able easily focus one hand . my only complaint while zooming subject , light level reduced , which occurs naturally due nature optics . you can't everything , but these just right , allowing my wife i use them time time again while observing nature . summary , good pair all-around use !	1

you get much expected this price range . 4x objective ( see meade example lacks it ) very desirable . 15x eyepice give acceptable quality 600x avoids much need go oil immersion lens . almost everything works quite nicely . i would recommend not using oil comes microscope - cedar oil . this older type oil slightly yellow harder clean than modern synthetics . buy tube modern low viscosity immersion oil edmund scientific or similar supplier . i found this oil works great 1000x 1500x this microscope cleans off reasonably easily isopropyl alchohol . i would definitely recommend purchasing this microscope , but also consider similar featured revelation iii lw scientific . it very slightly superior features , slightly higher price , company specializes microscopes ( vs . celestron , where their customer service knows almost nothing microscopy ; they telescope experts ) . there few tiny initial problems microscope . one eyepiece small optical defect near its periphery . celestron immediately exchanged it flawless one . iris diaphram came very slightly off center . there adjusment screws correct this . alignment error so small i haven't bothered fixing it . color filters , design , placed right top ( nice ) halogen light source . compare lw-scientific model mentioned which fileter holder few other light source advantages . fyi : achromat objectives typical ( no better , no worse ) amount spherical aberation outer edge , giving you 2/3 field view sharpest focus precisely flat specimen ( e.g. quality blood smear ) . this not defect this price range . apochromat plan objectives ahieve 95+% freedom spherical aberation cost much or more one lens than this microscope costs . this microscope uses standard lens sizes so it readily upgrade better eyepieces objectives acommodate kits specialized microscopy ( dark field , phase contrast , etc . ) , well accepting standard through eyepiece digital image capture accessories .	1
well !, i just purchased this sony a100 body only $[ ... ] no kit lens me . i bought sigma 28-105mm 2.8 af it . reason i bought this a100 because i got sony r1 few months back , r1 really impressed me its results images zeiss lens , thats motivated me buy sony dslr too , sony got great colors balance , contrasty , sharp , good dynamic range , not like other brands while colors off yellow cast . a100 small light compare other dslrs , it made malasia light plastic , not real pro body , but more like consumer camera , its good me cuz i need light dslr , a100 fast camera many ways , fast buffer refreshing time , review , delete , start up , af fast too . images stunning sharp help its body super steady shot . colors well balance , bright , neutral . lcd backside 2 neat features : if you turn camera vertical lcd turns vertical too , so you see info before shooting . when you put your eyes eye piece look thru view finder , it got smart sensor turn off lcd backside save batt life . super steady shot body really helps , now i buy any lenses sure all image stabilizer shots . small thing bother me a100 shutter slap noise when shoot , it clumsy ( clunk)sound it . price i paid , its best dslr its range . advantage a100 you buy many other lenses it like : minoltas , zeiss , sonys , sigmas , tamrons , tokinas , vivitars , quantaray.im happy mine , highly recommended whom who wants fast , light , small , good colors dslr . not mention good price too.im watching new coming sony pro dslrs coming june 07 . i use my a100 opteka battery grip , you see my review it here amazon , just hit search opteka grip .

if you pretty much any digital camera want closeups or see what you're taking pix before flash , you need this or similar light . german company makes high-wat led video light but it speckled pattern , not good closeup stills . light pattern this very even . closeup up light one hand camera other , cover object 6 8 inches . pull back widen light 2 feet or more across . keep video light close camera possible , reduce shadows camera sees . even outdoors 9000 ' colorado i found use this , taking picture shady trail where plant half shade , fix this . bulbs replaceable . yet 4 years one bulb never wore out , heavy usage , 8 hours time . ( 3 fp-970 batteries , such batterybarn.com sells give you 8 hours light . last time i got it off amazon , fp960 $47 computer brain . new 15 hour camcorder batteries power this light 2 1/2 hours)the onlything eventually broke switch . don't force it , push down middle safety button when turning it or eventually break it . take battery out when travelling so won't go accidentally . you add grip getting disk shaped tripod adaptor screwing hand grip such hakuba monopod / tablepod combo ( most comfortable grip there , $25 places like fry ) into tripod adapter . it gets warm , almost hot but keeps running no problem vent slits . even using it caving anza-borrego , we knew we sure 2 hours li-ion batteries . anyway , indoor shooting converence halls bad flourescent lighting , this brings out colors . you can't use flash closer than 2 feet most objects or you get too much glare reflection .. so use video light instead serious indoor shooting where you can't fixed light stand . use it 10 watt mode most objects , tall or dark objects , switch 20 watt . when battery starting run low , light only go into 10 watt mode . i sony video light 3watt dvd-403 . i keep this top camera sometimes when too much hassle get out video light . but it drains camcorder battery unlike this one , light output alot lower . good small objects tho . all means , turn flash when farther than 2 ' object looks slightly dark . this helps alot your pix . if it looks ok viewfinder / lcd leave flash off ! see flashlightreviews.com general light patterns battery life other flashlights incl led lights you might want buy . if sony would just come out led version i'd happy lark ! it would last 10 hours or more . most flashlights throw uneven ring pattern so unsuitable lighting photos	1
it great . i hadn't any problem phone interference . i recommend	1
best camera this price class . feature amazing , must feature . only complaint flash recharge time little slow due 2 aa batteries . if you take lots indoor pics , go canons 4 aa batteries ( a6xx ) . sports kids this great camera	1
last year , after extensive research , i bought canon a540 replace my trusty olympus d40-zoom . my goals camera selection where ( ) compact size , ( ) standard aa batteries , ( ) full manual controls , ( ) outstanding image quality , ( ) speed , ( ) optical viewfinder . a540 fit bill almost perfectly , handful limitations i noted my review . this year , canon release a570is , i decided upgrade , driven addition optical image stabilization ( ) . while impressive , i surprised other improvements canon made . image noise levels significantly lower more controlled higher iso captures . digic iii processor seems make more intelligent decisions lighting flash exposure , especially when its face recognition engaged . add dramatically better quality lcd screen , slightly higher 7.1 mp resolution , improved case , support high capacity sd cards , i doubt i'll need upgrade any time soon . like a540 , a570is me perfect balance size , speed , photo quality . a570is same physical size a540 . it small enough fit coat pocket or small belt case yet uses 2 aa batteries . like a540 , overall processing speed very fast unless you're taking flash pictures ( then you should expect 4-6 seconds flashes depending battery level what flash strength camera selected ) . note flash time significantly better high-capacity rechargeable nimh batteries than standard aas . , unlike some other cameras i tried , speed user interface ( especially during playback ) very fast . picture quality general excellent , even low light situations . noise higher iso significantly more controlled than a540 , perhaps benefit new 7.1 mp ccd digic iii image processor . according documentation , noise reduction applied slow shutter speeds 1.3 seconds or greater , this slightly slow down sho t-t o-shot time . there no option disable or adjust noise processing , but my experience results very good . when noise reduction applied , there slight loss detail compared a540 , but results noticeably better a570is its built-in noise reduction than post-processing noise pictures taken a540 . my own head-to-head comparisons a570is a540 , a570is better light metering noticeably sharper detail indoor shots without flash ( especially when image stabilization engaged ) . a570is favor slightly higher iso auto modes than a540 , giving generally better results without flash . however , when taking close-up pictures flash , a570is doesn't seem select anything lower then iso 200 , sometimes requiring manual iso override program mode . a570is offers new iso 1600 mode , but i'm not quite sold it . without tripod , under low light conditions , iso 1600 offer opportunity blur-free photographs not possible iso 800 . but level noise artifacts noise processing don't give very usable picture . a570is raises bar optical image stabilization , which only works when camera held horizontally . one biggest limitations consumer digital cameras need hold camera steady get clear shot . higher zooms night shots this problem compounded . i've taken number shots without , it useful but not " magic bullet " poor shots . small details like far-away signs night become clear when engaged . you set run continuously during preview , only when shutter released ( slightly lower battery drain ) , only vertical movement ( better objects moving horizontally ) , or disabled ( i yet find reason so ) . , unlike many cameras i've seen , works video capture mode . like a540 , a570is offers full manual controls . a570is , canon adds two more modes ( kids pets indoor ) mode selector wheel ( instead find them special scene menu ) . a570is also adds new aquarium scene mode , while removing useless color swap color accent modes . canon also removed " my camera " customization menu ( changing startup picture various sounds ) which i never used my a540 . although i never expected use it , movie mode excellent . it still not replacement dedicated camcorder . but i used it number occasions capture audio video when picture just won't . standard movie mode 640x480 ( vga ) quality 30fps , but you raise capture 60 fps 320x240 , or lower it 15fps 160x120 . a570 now capture video up 1 hour or 4gb whichever comes first . video files very large ( around 1.9 mb/second 30fps ) but they compress extremely well quicktime pro mpeg4 codec . a570is , canon also addressed some my minor complaints a540 . most notably , lcd screen much higher quality higher resolution . case plastics seem more solid , small rubber door covering usb - a/v - power ports pivots open side not top , handle area no longer chrome insert which tendency fall off . ring covers conversion lens adapter mount chrome trim , making camera more attractive but least my a570is it more difficult remove than a540 . once again , i looked canon a710is which offers 6x optical zoom , but same 7.1 mp sensor , optical image stabilization user interface older digic ii image processor . end , after trying both cameras store , i again settled a570is . a710is noticeably larger ( 0.25 inches wider slightly taller ) , more complicated lens takes longer startup zoom . both cameras limited number stops their zoom range , but this noticeable 6x a710is where it not noticeable 4x a570is . me , larger size wasn't worth extra zoom . benefits digic iii impressive . summary , canon a570is pros : - 7.1 megapixel sensor , 4x optical zoom- iso 80 1600- optical image stabilization higher iso or zoom , even during video capture- optical viewfinder shooting lcd off- full manual controls ( shutter priority , appeture priority , full manual)- preset custom white balance control- outstanding photo quality , even relatively low light ( good color balance , very low noise higher isos , almost non-existent chromatic aberation)- digic iii processor offers face detection , makes more intelligent decisions exposure , flash levels- very good results built-in noise reduction slow shutter speeds 1.3 seconds or greater- very fast startup sho t-t o-shot speed ( flash not withstanding)- excellent speedy auto-focus even low light ( although af assist light slow this down)- orientation sensor recognizes if you rotated camera take shot- flash adjusts angle based wide-telephoto zoom- built-in red eye reduction during playback lets you select area remove red eye save new or overwrite existing image- surprisingly usable movie mode - outstanding user interface : options well laid out easy locate , very well thought-out record playback options- extremely fast user interface playback performance , even zooming photos- high resolution lcd screen- well built case , very comfortable grip- uses sd cards supports high-capacity sdhc ( takes advantage high-speed sd)- uses 2 aa batteries ( least 2500 mah nimh rechargeable recommended)- very good battery life ( approx 400 shots 2 rechargeable nimh aa , display on)- replaceable lithium battery protects settings when changing batteries- supports optional high-power flash , conversion lenses underwater casecons ( me , all very minor ): - flash recharge time acceptable but not great ( 4 - 6 seconds shots using nimh batteries)- preview display blanks while flash recharges- auto iso indoor flash close-up pictures doesn't seem select below iso 200 ; you force iso 100 program or manual modes- iso 1600 questionable real-world use because noise artifacts noise reduction- noise reduction cannot adjusted or disabled- it possible insert sd card upside down you don't realize until you try close cover ( would easy break cover if you force this)- markings battery orientation difficult read- no raw image support , but you select 3 different compression ratios image qualitytips : 1 ) make sure you low-level format before you use your sd card this camera , even if you formatted it canon camera . it makes significant difference sho t-t o-shot speed2 ) always use high-capacity ( 2500 mah or greater ) nimh rechargeable batteries - flash recharge time much improved ( though still 4-6 seconds)3 ) indoor flash close-up shots , may need override iso 100 better quality4 ) outdoor shots bright sun , setting exposure -2/3 gives better control bright areas5 ) if you use conversion lens adapter , don't plan using built-in flash which partially obscured adapter . i haven't tried it , but would expect external flash not this problem	1
i admit , i new whole camera buying experience . frankly , i hate responsible keeping track something so small expensive when i am out getting wasted , but i am glad i made purchase . i needed something would help me remember what happened night before . it simple use , there isn't one those confusing wheels top funky symbols . this guy knows what i'm talking . since i dreading carry around camera , size definitely issue . when i took camera out box , its size blew my mind . if there one downfall i've noticed , it camera almost too small . make sure you use wrist strap when using ... especially if you drink much i ... wow ! anyone spare liver i could borrow ? preferably one clean free cirrhosis	1

my coolpix 8800 image stabilization zoom real pleasure use . i just wish somebody pointed one thing out me . when i finally got my computer upgraded handle large files , tried some camera raw files , nikon pictureproject reported raw ( . nef ) file un supported . when i went nikon web site which listed update process raw files , it asked my camera serial number . it then rejected number message i might camera wasn't nikon us camera , cancelled download . i'm not sure how this could avoided , but recommend any purchaser nikon camera register it immediately while they send it back refund if it doesn't meet nikon us requirements . i still like nikon cameras lenses , but i point out this problem anyone asking how i like my camera	1
i've owned 5700 , then 8700 , now 8800 . i've also owned half-dozen high-level 35 mm film cameras over years , beginning nikon s2 1950s ^|^ . 8800 fine upgrade 10x zoom vr fabulous ! i lot macro work , tripods not really always necessary these new days . best all image quality : vibrant , plenty " snap , " when recorded 8fine jpeg , easily enlargeable/croppable really big prints , resolution spare . af works well , controls more logically placed than its predecessors , still far more bells whistles than i'll ever use but they're not way . one terrific digicam . complaints : all accessories unique available only great price nikon . bah	1

after i spent much money my s80 , i wanted find perfect case carry it around i am very picky ! this first one i considered , but after so many bad reviews , i marked it off my list kept looking . i bought semi-hard case bodyglove but abandoned it because it too large it made me not want take my camera anywhere . then i bought cheap 3.99 case target super small light protected my camera well enough scratches while my purse but offered no screen protection . it slightly too small zipper kept catching strap i always stuff it . finally , i decided buy this case despite negative reviews when i saw my sister canon case her s450 . this just what i looking all ! it soft form fitting so it still fit my purse . it easy get my camera out quickly so i don't miss those shots ! it even hard front back so i know screen wont get scratched or punctured while my bag . so if this sounds like kind case you looking , don't scared away negative reviews !	1
i just needed nice , slim case protect outer casing my camera -- i wasn't looking anything heavy duty , no storage compartments , no bulky padding . love it	1
i am completely satisfied overall value this camera . picture quality great it very easy use . lcd clean bright . video capture lacks little , but price i don't think you could get any better .	1
i purchased this my son he really likes everything camera . he loves quality pictures . he mention camera proprietary cable hooks his computer - just fyi	1
i bought this tripod short while ago , i'm extremely glad i . it very light easy carry around , even without carrying bag or even handle , neither which it comes . bubble level built into it very handy works well . little practice , you break set it , camera attached , 10 15 seconds ( provided you keep quick release tab screwed bottom your camera , like i ) , so you won't miss once lifetime shot . it also very inexpensive easy use , head fantastic range movement . while legs , when fully extended , don't bring it all way up eye level , it brings it close enough keep you comfortable while looking through camera . if need , just buy small folding travel chair carry you use tripod	1
i bought this amazon more than $40 .. now it $5 less after only 2 weeks . sheesh .. anyway , tripod itself stylish it black color very useful because it 3 way pan it maximum height around 56 " . it lightweight it seems durable enough normal photoshoot sessions . if only this case or something , then it easier carry anywhere you go . might buy separate case purpose	1
well i bought this wed night recieved it fri night , you just love amazons free shipping , it simply amazes me how fast they ship out . now tripod , its mostly metal which i like its all black which i also like . it bubble level which comes very handy when outdoors uneven surfaces . all controls move very nice smooth which my biggest concern buying tripod online not able try it first hand . though i read some reviews online this tripod i happy what i read . i only wish it handle make it easier carry but i only seen bigger tripods handle . all all its great i love it , also it only 5.94 since i used my 25gc amazon weeeeeeeeeeif you dont want spend much i def recommend this one it out performs all crap circuit city offer	1
update 3/06 : well , after using this camera 3 months i come back following feedback : -it heavier bulkier than many 5mp cameras ( not fit standard pocket-size portable camera bag)-sometimes people lips come out black or purple pictures-the shutter lag time annoying ( someone reported above ) . i haven't yet figured out setting where camera take one shot exactly when i press button if i just took shot within last few seconds . so i get few pictures people frozen smiles their faces or miss some shots . anyone offer some advice this sticky situation ? -other than , i still love camera - great resolution if you red-eye reduction it works pretty well , battery easy rechargeoriginal review : i purchased nikon coolpix 8400 12/05it rated first advanced compact digital cameras category consumer reports 11/05we got big discount buying this camera through amazon.com when there limited-time promotionit actually shipped ritz cameracomes neck strap , battery charger ! not built-in memory so you need separately buy compact flash card . high-speed cf card would good idea . i would also recommend you buy extra rechargeable battery camera case . per specs : " coolpix 8400 , lens cap , strap , usb cable , audio video cable , rechargeable li-ion battery en-el7 , battery charger mh-56 , remote controller ml-l3 , pictureproject cd-rom " i changed settings take pictures " fine " resolution they running 1,600 - 2,500 kb size . " extra fine " mode also available but i don't think i need use it unless taking super-important photo . we upgrading nikon coolpix 5200 ( zoom button broke when i dropped it deck ) . 8400 black , not silver , bit larger/heavier . this digital camera big step up . 8400 seems better red-eye correction good backlit mode . some people complained nikon camera red-eye correction automatic , whether you like it or not , however 8400 you not need worry because it optional	1
i rated this camera 5 two reasons : 1 . ) highly polished product steal price . 2 . ) it more than i asked when i walked into store . i bought olympus d-460 $450 long time ago . 1.3 mp 3x optical zoom . then i bought this , 5mp 6x optical zoom * stabilization * quarter cost other one . i went looking 5mp w/3x optical zoom removable storage expectation dropping $200 . i ... but i also walked out 1gb sd card in-store repair plan . i've enough experience digital cameras know some type plan virtual necessity . no , this not high end camera , nor it pretend . but if you want something decent resolution , bunch presets , yet still allows you customize your own shot , then this your camera . i've snapping pictures ever since i got home it ... taking some really difficult shots ... tv ... computer . stuff dark closet . only thing it couldn't take decent picture me ... then again , professional photographer $3000 camera photoshop couldn't get good picture me . : -	1
i very pleased this easy use camera . it takes very good quality pictures price can't beat	1
such simple product difference lighting my photos dramatically increased when added my sb600 . when taking close up photos faces lit up come out very clear . definitely great addition my camera gear	1
i bought this lark , it just seemed like such fun though i bought it back dec , i finally really used it today wedding , i shocked ! it took great video inside church where my ( low end ) digital camera could not . i wasn't sure how video would actually turn out , but it great considering time things i paid $[ ... ] it . built software wonderful ( though i wish i could download it computer ) i made " movie mix " wedding camcorders software how fun ! shoot , $[ ... ] if all i got wedding video it worth it . i really couldn't believe how clear video this little " toy ! " i don't understand any negative reviews , it cheap , it fun it heck lot [ ... ] bucks . pure digital inc . $[ ... ] rebate their website . buy it , use it , fun !	1
i one those holdouts carried lots prime lenses , disdaining zooms " compromise " . no doubt , i missed some fine lenses because this . lens sold me zooms this lens , 16-45 f/4 pentax . lack distortion , contrast , fine color control , all finally convinced me zoom perform some functions prime . i've using this lens while . my studio , 50mm primes become main portrait lenses digital cameras . but now , i'm not afraid use zoom lens job . big step me ! it extends quite far when zooming , fact i don't like , those who care , on-camera flash blocked lens hood ( i use studio strobe , so it no import me ) . modern lens , it polycarbonate barrel ( they don't seem inclined make zooms lmited series . too bad ) . if i could use it film cameras , i probably would . no aperture ring means it definitely meant current cameras . despite all , i highly recommend this lens . it great " walk around " lens , going very wide moderate telephoto ( remember , it aps-c sensors ) . image quality astounding old grouch who loves primes , even lens general it right up there . if you're faced choice kit lens or this lens , take 16-45 . if you serious your craft , or you make living it , it well worth price	1
it very small , extremely well made , works perfectly . belkin pure hdmi cables also great value . no signal degradation noted this switchbox - seems completely transparent . i would buy one	1
it great camera quality price . only downside it so small , i am used camera feels weighs like camera . ( i think it little smaller than deck cards ) so if you want small , this camera you . or if you want great camera you adjust compactness , purchase this camera	1
i tried digital . i really . but i could never get really gorgeous shots i got my old yashica slr which gave up ghost several years back . i also could not really " focus " what i shooting ... just pointed shot because there no film run out . result ? pointless pics weren't even good looking . digital just didn't feel " right . " so 8 months ago i decided go back film . what get ? after much research , i finally decided canon t2 . absolutely brilliant camera . my favorite feature ? i let camera handle focus , etc . or i go completely manual . may not seem like big deal , but it feels so good control what camera when you want . course , means letting your imagination go ... something sorely lacking digital . couldn't happier no more pointless pics . okay , maybe few , but they still look good . isn't point	1
i got this after switching digital camera . digital cameras didn't offer depth i wanted not proofs big drawback . i am no means expert photography , but i know great photograph when i see one , this camera takes beautiful shots . this beautiful camera . elegant design ; grey body black accents definately attention grabber . people look your camera . it definately brains back up it beauty . loading film easy quick . it 8 or so presets . there automatic " point shoot " mode which you'll probably use most . it automatically compensates light , adjusting shutter speed aperture perfect shot . quick autofocus allows you grab your shot quickly , without waiting camera decide take picture . it also settings portrait shots , close ups , night , landscape , no flash , many others . those settings maximize camera features those particular shot . it also program setting where you program shutter speed , aperture , flash film advance . though comprehensive presets , i don't think you'll ever need use it . 28-90 lens comes kit nice , selector autofocus or manual focus . it also , course , removed so you add other lenses . zoom powerful leads beautiful shots . overall this unbelievable camera . great price , features , pictures best you've ever seen . they very crisp , clear almost 3d lifelike quality them , something i've never seen outside professionally taken photograph . this camera awesome	1
i looked digital cameras months - literally - before i just decided lug around 35 mm slr . everyone probably already knows , megapixels matter whole lot when you're talking blowing picture up larger size . what great film unless picture taken out focus , or bad light , you use negative blow something up quality really doesn't start go down until you're making huge prints . ( how huge exactly i don't know , but biggest i've blown up around 4x4 feet , still no trouble . ) prints i've gotten out this camera so far stellar . ( i use fuji film -- i think it better than kodak , even though kodak better commercials . give it try ! )the camera itself not too heavy , granted , it not convenience tiny digital camera , but it not bad i'd expected carry it around all day . neck strap nice , manual actually easy comprehend . i like camera buttons lot it features body -- it seems complicated first , but once you know how use features , they're much easier access than they would if you scrolling through menu . t2 seems worth hundred or so more dollars than you would pay very similar rebel k2 canon . one thing - make sure you take batteries out if you're not going using it week or more . it seems like they go dead if they're camera , even if it off	1
when my exilim ex-750 fell cooler , it over . i loved camera , but couldn't bring myself get refurbished one almost price what i paid 15 months prior . so , i " upgraded " exilim ex-z1050 . it even easier user than z-750 . changing most used settings very quick . lcd bright outdoors , so even though there no tiny viewfinder it not problem . i highly recommend this camera	1
just got this camera few days ago i admit i hesitant buy it because bad reviews z1000 got . my video camera built 4 megapixel camera , but i not happy quaily still pictures , so i started looking around several months . i love look , i taken tons pictures outside inside quality excellent ! i love quick burst mode taking many pictures same time . buy this camera , it incredible deal awesome camera	1
all around positive experiance ordering this camera . reasonably priced arrived time . i'am very please	1
i bought this ring fit wide angle lens my sony dsc-w1 it perfect fit . i love it . very high quality . only drawback , course , how lens blocks flash little	1
what i say ? i needed it connect zoom lens sony camera . worked great	1
this sunpak flash very nice flash price . it very cheap compared other 3rd party flash manufactures . auto mode this flash works really well . i say exposure calculated flash accurate 90% time given under normal lighting . there might some tricky lighting conditions could fool flash auto mode ... but then again , nothing perfect . i use this flash my fujifilm s9100 digital camera it very simple use . even though it might take some pratice , but it shouldn't scare you using manual flash . plus , you should feel like " real " photographer if you able use manual flash . just tell flash what iso you using how far subject camera , flash rest . return , camera tell you what aperature use . shutter speed , just set it highest speed your camera could synchronize external flash everything should ok . also , if you feel exposure little too dark or too bright , just adjust shutter speed step time compensate it . battery life , i get 100 shots out 4 rechargeable batteries ( nimh 2500 mah ) . anyway , this really reliable flash money . you don't really spend big bucks original manufacture flash such nikon or canon . just get sunpak flash it should work same , if not better . thanks reading .	1
i recently purchased gl2 , am very pleased results i'm getting so far . image quality great , especially such small lightweight camera . manual focus really nice . zoom amazing . should you buy this camera ? maybe . gl2 falls into odd mid range . if you just want easy use camcorder great image quality , i'd probably reccommend one small panasonic 3ccd cameras . if you want digital camcorder broadcast quality video or high definition , then you want step up next level . so , basically you could spend under $1000 get good simple camcorder , or you could get next level quality $4000+ . but this price -- $2200 -- this camera great . even though it not 24p , there something image me very well suited film ..	1
i wanted shoot my first short film , so i shopped shopped until i found this one , best price best features , looking back , i should saved my money . websites like mandy.com others , you easily make film putting 2k towards hiring junior or if your lucky , mid level dp w/ their own better equipment 200-400 day . if you short film mind dedicated work ethic w/ tight scheduling , you make entire film this way . but- if you want shoot get used holding cam setting shot angle lights actors everything else incvolved , this perfect starter cam . i actually wish i would saved up cash bought 24p cam like dvx100 or xl2 but this great entry level kids shooting their first flicks which mostly garbage anyways so ... make up your own mind	1
i dsc-r1 ( see my other review ) recently added telephoto accessory lens sony toolbox . oh , its companion " adapter " too . this not cheap lens nor it lightweight one , but it seems good one . front element this baby nearly 5 " diameter . what get you ? no loss f-stop start . that right , light-gathering ability sony addition already phenomenal optics carl zeiss vario sonnar costs nothing terms your ability " paint light " . ( your credit card , different calculation may appear . ) size lens makes necessary adapter " sidekick " mounting bracket . why ? without it , lens unbalanced , rather than cheap screw-on extender , this allows primary lens gain few elements become credible telephoto . it also advantage allowing quick removal tele use zoom primary lens adapter place . so you vision running sidelines capturing every grimace quarterback face defense floods over him ? not this lens . spring $ 8,000 canon outfit , get two you might get sacked yourself , assistant hand you your equipment . hiking into outback capture dawn mating kookaburra ? there better choices . ( note friends kookaburra : i seen one , heard one , but no actual experience their reproductive practices . ) other hand , if you occasionally need bit more reach manage tripod mounting , then all means pick one up . speaking " picking one up " , this lens hand-held deliver acceptable results ( better than using digital zoom or enlarging get same magnification ) , but only nearly still subjects . example , yacht race race deck club . ( my choice ) digital zoom ( 2x 120mm ) lower mega-pixels good enough , but not great . natural 200mm beats stretched 120mm any day , which what you get digital zoom alternative , but fast shooting combo may too , shall we say " bulky " . which brings me my main point : why we doing this ? photography i mean . if you see camera way capture visual poetry your mind sees , then this camera combo work you , you'll enjoy experience . if you see camera cool tool makes statement who you , well join gear heads photo chat rooms natter max-mega-pixel-mania spurn " point-and-shoot " favor bag full expensive interchangeable lenses . frankly , some best photographs all time captured spur moment , " point shoot " . excellent 24mm-120mm lens mounted camera , you'll get shot 95% time . if you need stretch you view bit farther time-to-time , all means spend $400 or so this telephoto combo look forward some good photography	1

i bought my k10d dec 06 after owning number pentax cameras over years very pleased engineering . combination features , if executed properly , make this camera best buy 10mp dslrs right now . i postponed my review because i wanted get some real field experience . i just went mexico , panicked because i left camera instruction manual behind . i now report trip . i little fumbling first , mainly because i didn't manual , but i soon able find combinations i wanted , camera performed both flexibly intuitively . af button exposure compensation button very well placed . i found myself difficult lighting situations often , both af exposure metering worked quite well . i also took some hand-held shots i normally would use tripod ( such 450mm ) , very few came out fuzzy because camera movement . few cases , i used bracketing , easily able obtain good balance details one or more bracketed shots . exposure metering worked so well i stopped bracketing . i particularly liked display modes : i could boost brightness see display even bright daylight , deep zooming gave me good check whether shot " soft " or not right scene . rechargeable li ion batteries , although not readily available stores , seem last forever ( even using power zoom , full-bright display , some fill flash ) . i believe i could shot all week ( 700 shots raw ( dng ) + jpeg ) battery grip attached . summary , this camera pleasure hold , very easy use manipulate , resulted high percentage crisp photos ( even if percentage well-composed shots lower because photographer ) . i bought it because its compatibility pentax lenses , 10mp sensor , shake-reduction technology , larger display , especially dust water seals . but what makes me quite happy it its overall ease use good results . i am still discovering its features , but i already know this camera frees me creative ways other cameras not past . some features this camera unique ( new program lines ) some available only cameras costing several hundred dollars more , making k10d good choice best buy . once again pentax , engineering supurb .	1
i owned * ist dl 8 month bought this upgrade . i don't any experience cannon or nikon . so my review mostly based comparison * ist dl . hope this help those same situation . i am not pro not pro . so i only need decent but inexpensive camera handful choice lenses . i bought k10d mainly ( 1 ) shake reduction ( 2 ) dust removal ( 3 ) raw button ( 4 ) 10mb ccd . course , there plenty other features expect . this pice level , i think k10d beats cannon nikon any others . plus , i da 50-200mm couple m42 takumar manual lenses . sticking pentax best me . after 150 test shots , i share you some my opinions : pros : -- shake reduction great ( but it its limit) -- dust removal comes handy -- raw button very useful -- manual choice any one 11 focus points , great composition -- faster focus than * ist dl -- rich functions , e.g. sv mode , program line -- support iso 100cons : -- weather-seal not mean too much if you don't get weather-sealed lenses -- 10m not much bigger than 6m (* ist dl ) , it good but don't expect big difference ( but this not pentax or k10d problem) -- battery meter drop full empty without stopping half-empty status -- pentaprism viewfinder not brighter than pentamirror my * ist dl ( least no noticable difference) -- shutter release not crispy * ist dl ( just personal feeling)it bigger heavier than ist dl . great ergo design . i am happy k10d . i take one star off cons listed . ps : ccd/stablizer slides inside ( even power off ) when you flip camera . little scary when i first got it . but after some reading i think it " normal " .	1

i've tested other pacific digital frames feature using any standard 8x10 frame really what i like most . i got this unit ( which comes dlink usb 802.11 dongle ) tested it my linksys router . after configuring windows correctly ( which they now posted web site ) , i able see frame my pc bundled software . there small learning curve , but i really like this method copying over photos instead wires . it takes same amount time you name frames if you mulitple units ( like living room , office , etc ) . overall this best resolution units i've seen removing wires gooood	1
not only this product allow us bring our camera into water get some really cool pics while we caribbean ; it also gave us peace mind knowing our valuable camera our possession we enjoyed water rather then leaving it unattended beach	1
this my third canon uw housing . i sold or gave away other two , i moved up sd110 ( 3.2 mp ) s500 ( 5 mp ) now sd550 ( 7.1 mp ) . all my previous cameras still great working order , still used regular basis , both inside housings out ( you see my previous reviews photos those housings elsewhere amazon site ) . i am underwater tour guide hawaii , so i put my housings through more day day abuse than average consumer . mine all held up well . you need religious soaking rinising housing after use . occasionally lube o-ring . not store it heat ( sealed up car hot day , etc . ) , since this likely warp it , cause it leak . other helpful hints i give , : 1 ) get soft carry pouch it , help ward off scrapes nicks plastic housing ( i use coleman stove pouch ) while transporting it . 2 ) not put camera housing while you your air conditioned hotel room . wait put it , until you outside . this minimize chances condensation forming inside housing it warms up . this housing little better than other two , there shade lcd back , which makes it little easier see bright conditions while it housing you wearing mask . my only complaint this housing lack thumb rest my right thumb . other housings one . but this one cannot , due it small size . since lcd much bigger than other models i used , it means all controls shoved way over one side back panel , leaving you little room hold onto it . since i typically wear gloves water , i , few occasions , knocked camera out one shooting mode into . not real big deal , it never cost me photo , but you need look display sure you right mode . just minor complaint , i understand why , since camera so small lcd very large size camera . overall great product price , especially if you like able take nice quality uw photos while your snorkel/dive vacations	1
most part it good product . taking pics darker places seems minor challenge due othe different features . also , when zoomed , pictures taken sometimes not clear you would like them	1
simply pu t--t ake three pictures side side camera stitches them together make wonderful panoramic shot ... no computer even needed . three snaps shot ! camera excellent kodak colors 7mp detail . camera also nice zoom take super wide shots its 23mm lens -- no need back up across room get everyone shot . but it simple panoramic feature make this camera unique . wonderful scenery , etc . wide angle lens , it no wonder real estate agents snapping these up ...	1
this actually 1500mah battery opposed original en-el3 which " just " 1400 .. so very slight increase . this new battery released d70s , but it work d70 . check out kenrockwell[dot]com verify . nikon doesn't list mah specs this battery their website	1
very nice piece equipment . great taking self portraits . i very prompt delivery . thanks amazon !	1
figi underwater camera out ranks many others due fact after going through beefed up security scans when developed it bright color clarity . others turn dark	1
if you reluctant invest $$$ ' real ' underwater camera , this fine temporary solution . i realize it not rated go beyond 17 feet but i took two them 90 feet no problems whatsoever - all seals held i could wind film just fine . only slight critizism pictures come out more blue compared kodak max ( which i used same dive site year earlier ) . but hey , if you're going way beyond manufacturers specs , you're not really allowed complain ... snorkeling ( down 30 feet ) , pictures come out real nice	1
this charger fully charge blm-1 lithium battery 2 hours ( or less if it partially discharged ) . there red light indicates it charging ; it turns green when battery fully charged . it very dependable small unit , so you store it camera bag minimum space required .	1
camera one best considering price size it . only problem i found it not light , so you need buy external one , if not all shots you night very dark	1
this camcorder few months now it put lot use . compact , light , easy carry around . tons features which takes getting use since most it touch screen . battery life pretty good . video quality excellent well . very happy purchase , i no problems so far	1
i love this camcorder ! it fantastic low light , good lighting too . i torn this new hidef camcorders out right now chose this one mainly because low light ability . i not disappointed all . there numerous manual controls tweak any shooting condition . almost all separate buttons dedicated perform then individual functions . it balances very well , while it heavier than small cameras it really not feel way after short time using it . i would buy this again	1
leica lens great bonus my decision add camera . i love size . my other panasonic/leica camera took several falls long trip never stopped performing . it discontinued , so it now held together duct tape . this dmc-fx07 wonderful replacement.ps . i bought cell phone belt case leather magnetic closure perfect camera case . ($[ ... ]	1
i absolutely love this camera . i my research before purchacing what i found held true . flash only issue . it not strong enough take far away shots . this camera exactly what i wanted though , small lightweight camera takes excellent pictures i carry it almost anywhere	1
sony great job again . it could bit better low light conditions , but ' back light ' option it works well .	1
sony dcr hc32 one sleekest cameras it price . however , i find little touchscreen tad difficult use without stylus ( wonder why sony couldn't include one ) . if you stubby fingers like me , it takes while get used tiny menu buttons . inevitably , screen gets covered thumbprints . i started using top-eraser small pencil . sony also notorious not providing larger optical zoom , even its high-end camcorders . fact , this camcorder fares better than some more expensive sony mini-dv . though 20x probably okay casual use , it would help some more . lastly , aware package extra battery docking station not worth much . i irked find battery only charged while its loaded onto camcorder ( which then set dock or take ac power directly ) . this stupid feature means you cannot charge battery while simultaneously recording off second one , basically defeating purpose extra battery . i would recommend considering canon zr600 which cheaper , more optical zoom widescreen recording capabilities . it almost small , but i think it still lacks external battery charger	1
camera great point shoot users . it very easy use ( although camcorder menu bit tricky ) very decent images . software provided not great .	1
following camcorder first camcorder i ever owned . i purchase it because i am interested taking home movies keepsake . purpose , this digital camera work perfect anyone , however , if you keep your expectations too high , you probably disappointed . many people complaned motor noise camera this line , if you purchase zr 800 , you use external mike high quality possible , avoid this background noise . if you like me , wanted higher offered pixel ratio , then you get zr 850 , which lacks external mike possibility preventing noise . noise , i might add , appears me little more than suddle white noise background , which easily filtered out most video editing software . when recording sd card ( plus 850 ) , movies shot rather low resolution appear bit blurry me . part this could videos i shot this way consisted lot close ups . this camera not seem designed doing much lines close ups . night vision very good job pitch black . small led front camera adds extra light . unfortunately this only light you get , since any high powered light isn't available attach this camcoder . led doesn't add very much light , any low light area , picture resolution severly hindered , but still seeable considering how dark it . still pictures look decent , but obvious static you would easily not see any modern digital camera very evident , so definately don't purchase this digital camera replacement . battery lasts 45 minutes , guide suggestions you buy larger batteries increase life . since i kept my expectations so high , i expected resolution little better camcorder general . it decent enough , so sound . i just expected more than i should small handheld camera . camera feels great though , it easy carry , easy use . you run pretty much no risk getting your fingers way view finder . it very comfortable easy use . very little instruction needed figure out just everything you it . my biggest beef this product , which really nothing product itself , it didn't come firewire cable or capturing software . this means you can't transfer stuff your compuer out box . rather , you need get firewire cable ( presuming you firewire port ) up $35 price best buy . you probably should order cable camera . capturing software available canon website , just requiring you register your product . after trying several programs , roxio seemed work best me trying capture video . capturing video breeze , although more software than camcorder itself . besides , its good product , it comes remote control if you happen filming yourself , av cables so you put image television . not best market , but pretty decent camcorder , especially discounted price .	1
wonderful pictures . prints great pictures .	1

purchased this unit new $160 . good performance - little practice , getting readings well over 800 yards , even bright sunlight . also like fact it uses standard aaa cells . housing design leaves bit desired - it bulky , battery cover not very secure . see losing cover easily . not ergonomic more recent models . overall , $160 rangefinder genuine 800 yard performance , good deal	1
this camera case stylish , compact fun ! aware there not much extra space inside store camera cards , definetely not room extra batteries . there plenty larger camera cases purpose ; this camera case stepping out style	1
only used it once so far it worked great	1

i similar issue reviewer ... my z740 lcd screen failed few months ago . i turn camera all screen shows solid white . little eye-piece viewfinder still displays fine , pictures videos still come out fine , but i can't use lcd screen my viewfinder any more ... which one biggest reasons i bought camera ... others online this problem , but i can't find anyone who gotten it resolved . my camera well out warranty , so i no hope kodak fixing it . otherwise though , it great camera ... very impressive actually . i just wish it hadn't died after year half occasional use ... : -	1
i bought this camera last summer . i taken enough pictures put up review now . i love this camera ! pure simple , it met exceeded my expectations . pictures it takes very nice , sharp , focused , crisp . it so many features you play around . i probably only used half them more than once . it very nice lcd display , or you take pictures through traditional peep hole . view screen it always tell you , which mode you , gives you nice centering square , what picture you , etc . zoom it awesome , although i haven't used much date . you take close up shots flowers , insects , etc ., it still get everything just right . three my favorite features though : option take video clips , fact you shoot photographs black white or sepia color , which gives your pictures real antique or historical feel depending what you going . it even let play around shooting night picturs , or different landscapes near far . when you print out pictures off your computer , if you any kind decent printer you almost shocked how detailed crisp picture . i would almost swear it better than film pictures . i couldn't stop looking it , because i so amazed ! person like me mainly takes normal snapshots most time , i don't know what else i could ask camera ! moreover , you can't go wrong price . it little more expensive than other cameras ? sure ! however , features it it well worth it . it isn't exorbinent begin . way , you people like shop around best price like me , i went 3-4 different stores my area cameras like this one , best price i found here amazon . if you buy it , you love it , end story .	1

great little bag carrying not only digital camera printer but room camera , extra film , memory , etc . bag well constructed easily carried via shoulder strap . lots pockets come handy . also very stylish . great value	1
we bought this digital camcorder just under year ago very happy it ... up until last week . lcd screen just quit working . no mishandling or anything . we still record using viewfinder , but who wants when one main reasons we bought this model lcd screen recording viewing . issue comes up when screen quits working playback mode , you must utilize play/rw/ff controls ( record mode entire control menu unaccessable well ) touching screen . when screen doesn't work , this issue . you still use these controls if you flip screen over shut it back into camera ( screen facing out ) then guess where buttons would ... challenging because they're upside-down now , backwards . sony apparently only 90-day warranty , so we now requird pay $136.74 labor get lcd screen repaired . thank goodness it quit working less than year after we bought it new , because first year least parts free !? we realize things don't last forever , but when one buys $600+ video camera reputable name like sony , you expect it work least year . if not , things made right no charge you . very disappointing . buyer beware	-1
this one best camcorders market today i would definitely recommend it anyone planning buy mini-dv camcorderpositive factors : - very small easy hold one hand . easily attached even mini-tripod ease . - excellent widescreen video hi-fi audio . your videos finally get " hollywood " feel when you shoot movies 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format ) . even if you don't widescreen tv currently , you very soon one more more people buying them . so its better buy this camcorder shoot 16:9 format enjoy your movies later widescreen format . - includes widescreen rotatable lcd so what you see what you get when you shoot 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format)- good battery life . one extra battery enough . you easily manage day worth shooting two batteries before recharging them again- includes docking station making it easier connect computer or tv . if you good computer firewire port , please buy firewire cable connect camcorder your computer . you download your movie excellent clarity . avi format edit it required- make sure change audio setting 16 bit ( instead default 12 bit ) very good hi-fi audio- touchscreen menu system great . you don't search any buttons they all available touchscreen menu itself . - 12x optical zoom more than sufficient ordinary home videos . anything more produces more " shaking " would necessiate use tripod . when you shoot without tripod , 12x best zoom you achieve without worrying shaky videos- 1 mp widescreen still photo . you use this feature if you forgot bring your digital camera . photo clarity not good so please don't expect great shots . since photo 16:9 format , you take panoramic photos cover more people group shots- nightshot : cool feature records using infrared light . useful shooting night you record video even 100% darkness- color widescreen viewfinder - very useful when you running down batteries need use viewfinder . color widescreen viewfinder gives excellent picture good lcd claritynegative factors : - outdoor videos especially bright sunlight overexposed . so please adjust white balance when shooting outdoors . add white-balance menu your shortcuts so you easily access it return default once you start shooting indoors- sensitive microphone may pick up button clicks ( best turn off button click " beep " sound ) . notes : - use fresh cassette after recording 2 or 3 times same cassette . head tends get dirty if you re-record same cassette more than 3 times- you edit movies windowx xp using windows movie maker , but beware it not support 16:9 ratio video . hence your videos look ugly you shot them 16:9 but movie maker converted it 4:3 . invest pinnacle software version 9 or 10 better movie editing capabilities . pinnacle only software , i am aware , preserves teh 16:9 ratio . even roxio could not allow 16:9 format . - you also invest wide-angle lens it gives excellent coverage	1
this binocular simply fell into my hand though it made me personally . love first feel ? yes ! i compared this binocular several others same price range , here what i found : fit finish : nikon easily equal any vixen or pentax or olympus ( i didn't try canon ) . feel : nikon far best . optics : nikon something clever here . first all , they gave this one wider field view than , example , pentax pcf . looking through pentax ( , way , i high regard pentax * love * their papilio series , but binocular different purpose ) after using nikon , view seemed dimmer claustrophobic . nikon , you wonderful feeling actually " out there " field or sky your object . everything so bright sharp ! nikon really excels sharpness center . however , nikon clever thing ( i checked couple pairs these nikon binos see if this true generally , it ): this price point you can't possibly whole field view perfectly sharp . no binocular perfectly sharp edges . here what nikon , best i tell : they put sloppiest edges outside top field view . wow ! think it : if you compromise somewhere , you want compromise away center bottom . why ? because , inside edge fov each barrel where object . , most likely ( especially terrestrial viewing ) , object or its environment also resting or near bottom ( think bird tree or animal ground ) so , nikon seems made sure bottoms inside edge fov sharp possible , while allowing far outside top edges little worse . smart ! there some chromatic abberation , but , too , unavoidable this price . even some very high priced camera lenses ( only one barrel worry ) this . ca not all objectionable . little rim faint purple edges fov high contrast situations . very nice binocular . not too heavy , not too big , very comfortable use , excellent imagery , top-of-the-line sharpness-at-center , great construction . i expect get lifetime enjoyment out them .	1
i like this camera . size great , it cool carry around wow factor . screen huge camera this size . i love it ! navigating menus graphically pleasing . pics ok , flash works decently . i one nagging problem : video . ( note : i've only taken indoor video . outdoor , daytime video may not problem . ) if you get right lighting adjust settings just right , you get good looking video this type camera . my problem , it rare everything so perfect . when you look around room without camera , you see things normally . when you look same room same lighting through camera , it almost completely dark . you put " low light " setting all time . problem this setting blurry , so you move camera around very very slowly not get headache watching video . ( manual suggests you only use this setting tri-pod . ha ! this only way see anything indoors ! ) bottom line : i constantly adjust settings camera before i take video order get decent viewable quality . exacerbating problem video lights two lcd lights , they absolutely useless . they flashlight " pointing " effect rather than flooding effect . so if you use it , center your view lit circle fading dark towards edges screen . even such poor performance , lights still too bright ppl look camera while it . speaking completely useless , don't even bother using image stabilization . it makes video extremely blurry ... unusably blurry . they should rename feature " image messer-upper " . said all , i really like this camera . i've focused video because it probably one thing bothers me this camera . everything else great . even though i've harped video , it possible get decent quality video once you adjust settings . it just nags me bit it not easier . i shouldn't turn low light setting all time , setting shouldn't make things so blurry . then again , i bought this camera $200 aiptek website got $100 worth accessories free . so i try remind myself i buy low-end pocket-sized camcorder . that probably most important thing remember . if you buy this multi-function camcorder what it , you get great product . if you want $1000 high-end camcorder size small digital camera , you're not going get it $200 . update : ( 16 mar 07 ) i finally got chance use this camera outside sunny day . video excellent ! beautiful ! i am so much more pleased this camera now i know , least normal daylight settings , i get great looking video . no " low light " setting necessary . no blurriness all ! i even played it back my tv , it still looks great !	1

i using this camera 2 months , taking it cruise well filming couple college choir concerts . all went well , exceeded my expectations , based other reviews i read . only problem i seen lowlight indoor filming , however fix i came across supposedly works , but i not chance try it yet ( see fix end review ) . 20gb drive plentry me , cpaturing several hours hd quality film , still plenty drive space remaining . i very few problems software , ones i more around lack manual , but figured out thru trial error . overall , i would highly recommend this product anyone interested new camera . plus you stop buying tapes . lowlight fix ( note i not take credit this , found it web but not remember where ) . here text exactly i found it , including comments end . how i get good low-light/indoors video ( following steps indoors camera capture mode ): 1 ) disable " gain up " feature ( major contributor grainy low-light video ) 2 ) turn " manual " mode ( via auto button ) 3 ) go manual control menu ( down ' stick ' ) 4 ) set ae ' +2 ' 5 ) highlight ' mwb ' wb menu , point camera sheet paper ( position camera so sheet paper fills view camera ) press hold middle ' stick ' until ' mwb ' stops blinking ( 5-10 seconds ) . 6 ) set . sp . 1/60 7 ) press down ' stick ' exit manual control menu after doing this , my indoors video quality much better ( no more noise/grainy video ) . settings saved , even if battery removed or depleted ; they return even if you switch auto mode then back manual .	1
i got this wide angle lens my sony dcr-hc96 . it fit great ( it says , it 30mm ) . i've wide angle lenses past which created distortion corners frame - that not case this lens far i see . i'm happy picture quality . if you intend film indoors , my advice definitely get wide angle lens . $30 it well worth it .	1
i only use few times , but price it great job	1
this great lens . sharp tack . big but not heavy . it kodak , says it all .	1
i am pleased purchase wide angle lens my kodak dx-7590 digital camera . but ! i am disappointment lens not used cameras built-in flash it , produces shadow . kodak not offer external flash dx7590	1
when you buy product designed meant fulfill certain needs , just expect best performance out those features . pc55 camera everyday home shooter , easy use made best sony quality one smallest mini dv camera ever created . if you thinking buying this camera don't hesitate one minute , this camcorder one kind , it gives you pretty much flexibility video quality regular camcorder but amazing bring-it-in-the-pocket size all coolness attention it brings ( let it your best ice breaker , believe me it works like heaven ! ) . i work camera store let me tell you : we haven't received one return this model during time i've worked there ( 8 months ) , which proves high quality sony built into this model . i using mine few months now all i say " product great ... period ! " . let get real , 500 bucks you paying it not film quality kind movie you get picture ( you need spend least couple thousand dollars ) but portability worriless no need big luggage camcorder used past " ( some times people don't realize motorcycle couldn't compared truck or vise versa ) . picture shooting option , well let see ! camcorder videos digital camera photos , if you want them both one package , brings excellent quality , you'd spend lot more money than if you bought them separately , let me explain you few words , average photo quality mini dv camcorder 1.3 mp or lower ( same quality you get out your cell phone camera ) honest you , manufacturers add this option just give it extra feature same time take more money out your pocket , tape less digital cameras it happens same way , video sound quality very poor ; so why bother paying more camera both functions excellent ( there quite few out market now , starting around $1200 models similar size ) instead buy two little cameras , one each use , half price . if you looking cool , high quality durability mini dv camcorder smallest size available its kind , sony dcr-pc55 your best option . finish , i just want wish you all enjoy , more than product , unmemorable moments you live your loved ones because this little fellow	1
if you want capture every precious moments , this right camcorder you . it easy operate video crisp clear . sound pretty good well . you also take still picture video same time ( thanks memory stick ) . don't burn your video using your computer , it took me time download cd or dvd . instead burn them you watch them . it quicker way . you love it first time you use it	1

hii bought this camera after powershot a80 , which unfortunatley got stolen . i loved th powershot a80 , this camera , younger successor a80 also good camera . it fast , good picture quality , battery life great it really good camera if you new getting into phtoography want learn little more shutter speed aperture . one my only gripes it doesn't seem great low light . it always moans me taking potentially unsteady shot when light low , i don't remember a80 ever fussy . but i think it down cramming 7 mp into same sensor size 4 mp a80 , so each pixel becomes smaller , therefore less sensitive light . i taken some really great photos this camera , would only replace it moving up digital slr , however i would still use it everyday carry around camera . it metal frame construction makes it quite robust too . i dropped it many occasions , once solid stone floor , 6 feet , aside little dent casing , it worked fine . i recommend it	1
love it . it several months now yet find something wrong it . if you've owned digital camera before , there absolutely no learning curve what so ever . just follow your guts you'll find function you want . but all frequently used ones right there your finger tips . i personally love custom timer function allows you set delay up 30 " take up 10 pictures ! you never go back forth ... use energizer e2 lithium batteries you'll wondering if you camera your hands it becomes soooo light	1
case great , but someone else mentioned there no strap . big draw back when carrying camera	1
its great camera dsc-w7 other this series since it small stylish . besides it doent " sony " writen it , just cyber-shot logo . it also small secon pocket storage adicional batteries memory sticks . my only complain this second pocket not big enough keep also my a/v usb cables	1
my twins both rec'd these cameras . they take camera them school trips or vacation . they even took pictures their own bday parties . plug camera into computer play great borders . twins so much fun them .	1
it good case extra battery very usefull trips or events	1
very nice camera case , battery added bonus . all half price battery would cost . now my camera safe home i'll never run out power my adventures ....!!	1

i several digital cameras this tops them all !!!! everything they say it , true . i love not even think batteries , i didn't believe what people said battery life , i just happy i didn't need think batteries , but i just got married my 13 year old daughter took more than 100 pictures this camera her pictures almost good photographer i hired yes camera battery lasted all day thru next 4 days our honeymoon 200 pictures taken , no low battery light !!!!! i even going buy my parents one . also , one more note i love how fast you take pictures , no wait 4 seconds shots . i kodak digital before only 1 1/2 years old hated it , i hated download procedure , it didn't put your pictures onto your hard drive , but it own little cubbyhole trying attach them your email absolutely nightmare , you'd identify picture copy it your desktop , remember what you called it then attach it your email . this main reason why i purchased this camera . i never own anything else , especially kodak .	1
my husband purchased this camera me my birthday last year . his aunt uncle one we thought it simply amazing . since our purchase , we've help several our friends family members buy same camera through amazon . actually , we've bought 4 other ones besides one my husband bought me my birthday . i highly recommend this camera everyone . it small , many neat features , quality pictures best i've ever seen any digital camera . don't just take my word it , buy one see yourself . it very affordable . ( best feature	1
i love just everything this camera . it nice small , it easy use , it takes nice photos . but , i haven't figured out yet how get good night photos , ' though , i've used " best shots " ( feature camera ) . i've it 3 months am still learning it . but , all all , i love this little camera . price right , it what you want it if you get camera sun shield , any camera store ( $19.00 ) , you'll glad you	1
i love : how quick responsive it . how tiny it ( without " i lost it again " tiny ) . i'm surprised it sub $200 , seems like camera worth much more than tha t.t he photos it takes gorgeous . video it takes surprising good quality . battery lasts quite impressively long time , recharges quickly . screen gorgeous . menu navigation easy . only downsides :( this minor ) focusing takes tiny bit getting used . it'll shoot without you focusing properly if you get trigger happy . it feels bit fragile - like ipod ( although i've already dropped it it survived fine ) so you'll want decent case it	1
good product , like price . this much less expensive than current pinseeker 1500 models , i bought it ebay used $150 so you may able find it less ( look under hunting golf rangefinders this model ) . this not pinseeker feature newer models but normal mode scan mode work perfectly ranging flags no reflectors ( although you may need try more than one time relatively stable hands ) . i able range flag 270 yards , able range top telephone pole 375 yards ( but it windy so flag straight out little cloudy ) . i would estimate this work ranging flags calm sunny day ( these don't work well sunny day because laser used visible light laser gets little interference sunlight ) 215-230 yards flag ( which what i need it ) . less expensive alternative than pinseeker , i really like performance , very impressed .	1
this product rugged forgiving . accurate +/- 1 ft ., this absolute must all serious bowhunters . lightweight easy use , i find only one minor design flaw . it designed right-handed use slightly cumbersome those who choose use it left-handed hunters ( i am ) . even this minor design flaw , i still am very satisfied this unit would not hesitate recommend it others . most encounters under 50 yards ease use accuracy critical elements hunt . i harvested nice elk this year 52 yards using this unit . thanks bushnell	1

lacross charger using these batteries . these batteries blow away both rayovac 15 minute 2000mah energizer 2500mah batteries . i baby monitor chews up batteries these batteries last over 3 hours one charge . energizer rayovac last hour most . i using them 2 months non stop rotation seen no performance degregation . also my digital camera , i leave these there weeks , shoot many shots they still going . others i can't leave them there they simply loose power quickly . cannot say enough good things these batteries . i would highly reccomend them anyone make sure bundle it la crosse charger	1
i deal major brand cameras panasonic cameras my personal favorite ! i've seen people whine " noise " they make many times but never found it problem . i own fz10 fx01 my personal cameras . fx01 very fast camera takes great pics ! i love 28mm wide lens . compared most cameras i've used fx01 real good job metering light exposing images . i love panasonic solid build reliability . they may not popular canon or sony but my opinion every bit good .	1
good product but color not so attracticed	1
truly amazing little camera . i looking something small i could stick my pocket when i go out everyday but still took sharp pictures . this camera all more . its small solid still manages take gorgeous photos very nice videos . i highly recommend this camera anyone looking easy use very portable camera	1
canon all way ! i've s230 , sd300 , sd400 , sd630 . i really not like feel sd630 very much after living it while . i also didn't like button placements .. not comfortable it . it take great pics video . but , i moved sd1000 ( black ) , it one week love it ! all canon point-and-shoot digitals , this my favorite . it tiny so pocketable . pleasure use . switches buttons where they should feel good . screen 2.5 so people who want 3.0 need go sd750 which basically sd630 replacement digic iii processor . same form factor . if you liked sd200 , sd300 , sd400 , sd450 or sd600 , you love this ! my only reservation how great pics this little camera . i'm sure they excellent but jury out how good they compared earlier canons . i like vivid pics so i may set camera vivid . got good deal amazon	1
i got this camera use digital photo class . it wonderful . there wasn't anything confused me when i first got it , it took great pictures . software little tricky because it moved all my photos different place gave me very little access , but easily taken care uninstalling software using usb cable itself . 10x zoom great , but if you move all your picture quite blurry . i would get tripod use when you it zoomed really far . overall it great camera takes great pictures good video	1
very easy use , using it over two years now . great quality pics easy print , command , choose options quickly . also take fast photos so you not miss any moments . also like video mode shot blips when i forget or not want carry camcorder	1
i shopped around online quite while before i settled this tripod . i narrowed it down this one slik u9000 . all other things equal ( what i could tell ) , i chose this one aesthetics . i not chance use it yet , but it looks very sturdy , not cheap all ( cheap relative thing , i'm not professional , so me it fine ) . i'm glad i bought it . it well worth price	1
like other reviewer - i checked out tripods camera store . hadn't heard velbon , but quick internet search showed them recognized name tripods . i needed tripod my nikon d50 ( especially 70-300mm zoom lens ) , perhaps video camera , df-60 fit bill - lightweight , quick set up , leveling bubble , detachable baseplate , etc . sure , it pretty much all plastic , but if you take care your equipment - shouldn't make much difference non-professional use . it stable enough built-in leg brace spreader . price camera store almost $70 - amazon beat them mile . received it few days . so far - everything i though it would . highly recommended if you need lighweight tripod . now i need get bag so i sling it over my shoulder	1
i got this lens d50 package . it not pro-lens any stretch imagination , but it works well 99% situations . only limiting factor i found f4- 5.6 range . some situations ( mostly indoor ) you forced use flash . however , we talking dimly lit rooms this point . i've some indoor action sport shooting this lens - gym lit fluorescent lights this lens no problem delivering quality pictures without use flash . ( crisp sharp images , correct colors , no distortion ) focusing not issue	1
beginner or avid photographer this really lens buy . clarity picture quite nice weighs no more than 18-55mm lens comes camera . i am very pleased performance this product would highly recommend it others . i not noticed grainy pictures like some others said plastic focus , you would never think twice it . great lens ! thanks nikon making product reasonable yet high quality ! works great my d50 .	1
adapter great . no issues , shipment received very quick time-frame . lens blocks flash canon g6 , but other than , pictures turned out great ! it all i hoping	1
it pretty neat case . fits nicely . but it only accomodate camera maybe extra cf card . if you want carry spare battery , battery charger , usb cable , etc , then this case definately not yo	1
i bought this camera six months ago my 12 year old daughter . it her ( ours ) first digital camera . i read so many reviews prior selecting this model . reviews this camera so helpful . this camera so easy use it takes excellent pictures . rechargeable batteries definitely must ! this camera best camera this price , no doubt it . we taken still shots videos . it so fun option take video . we some great clips . all i say we so happy camera . we would definitely choose it again	1
cute , compact , easy use - these just few ways describe canon cool a400 ! this stylish digital camera lightweight perfect snapping shots go . mine sunset gold . plus , there perks like macro mode ( which lets you snap sharp pictures close 2 inches ) , lots shooting modes ( like snow fireworks ) . movie mode lets you capture video clips sound . this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . just what you would expect canon	1
case great , easy use camera fits it well . it nice option put belt thru it extra little case hold batteries/extra memory cards nice too . would recommend it anyone	1
good all around works well ; however , external case gotta go . sony should made case fit battery memory sticks inside	1
all tamrac products it inexpensive well made . this 5th tamrac bag i bought various cameras i . first one i bought still holding up almost 10 years later .	1
tamrac makes great camera case , this one no exception . sturdy well-made . it advertized right fit my fujifilm s-9000 , but it actually bit too small this camera . time i got camera pushed , surrounding pouches squeezed so tight little else would go . i should gone bigger case	1
i've this digital camera almost year . it fourth camera i've owned . i spent quite some time searching compact camera i could carry everywhere . amateur photographer ( mostly taking pictures myself not others ) , i didn't want lug around extra bag just my camera . it fits discreetly your pocket or small purse ( formal nights out ) . size weight this camera its best feature , this carries through newer generations this camera , too . this perfect camera everything selling items on-line landscape scenery . my pictures always turned out beautifully , wonderful color crispness . i discovered " automatic " lighting feature not always most ideal , but you re-program just anything this camera . it really quite good camera , given its price these days newer generations out there , it steal	1
it everything i expected , works great amazon partner service very goo	1
my grandparents one love it . its very easy work . takes great pics . its also easy share your pics tv . they love it i love it .	1
i am accustomed using larger point shoot zoom . this sleek pocket sized point shoot gives exceptionally sharp pictures . it focuses very swiftly i would suppose due leica lense . battery life good . i notice photos tend calibrate little blue range . i like little more zoom . overall , i like it very much	1
i enjoy this camera i carry it my pocket wherever i go . it takes great pictures videos . only problem i it hard turn off big fingers	1
this camera pretty fast small enough kept your pocket used if photo opportunity occurs . it also offers wide screen modes taking videos ( 704x384 ) addition excellent standard resolution ( 640x480 ) . my one concern it looked like all pictures i took blurry review screen back camera ; after i take shot , image appears few seconds review then goes back capture mode- all review shots looked out focus . i uploaded images my computer they looked fine . i also went back camera put it play mode they also looked great- so i think scaling review image ( 7.2 mp t0 230k ) after taking picture blame this ; ( perhaps ) fixed future firmware update . all all , this great camera . i keep it me much possible it given me some awesome pictures .	1
pros : compact , lightweight , portability , easy use , big screen , good reproductioncons : microphone sensitive wind , getting used not viewfinder , bad low light performance . summary : i picked this camera upgrade my old canon zr10 . first reason i chose it small size portability . good light conditions , this little beast its best shots , but low light conditions this camera disapointed me ( specially compared mi old zr10 ) . please don't buy it if you plans use it stills shots because it low resolution . included handycam station all ports ( firewire , usb , power , video ) you need conect it . big touch screen must , because screen only way access camera controls ( besides some them edge screen ) . you camera more characteristics better image quality same price , but if your concern size portability this your best choice world mini dv format	1
i can't really belive quality this product until i manage make print out my hp 8050 . i may need upload picture . if you plan buy one camera around $100.00 i belive this would right choice .	1
i bought gs180 prior my trip china . i also bought 4 hour after-market battery ; i've since bought one . that what you'll need if you touring all day using lcd screen all time . battery , viewfinder becomes just useless since it doesn't tilt up . review says camera doesn't come lens cap ; mine . i've remote my sony digial 8 but only used it few times . this camera haves some options only available through remote , though , such audio dubing variable speed search . it aftermarket accessory , picture quality very good . stills taken sunlight also very good ; however , they subpar low light situations . contrels fairly self-explantory . outdoor stills very acceptalbe ; you produce them while shooting video which nice when you see something you kow make good still . large sd card , you shoot 1000 these . i opportunity shoot lion dance just fied way , clicking constanlty , getting great sitills while capturing video . i only havea couple functions i need learn manual ; cmaaera fairly straagiht foward . joystick works great moving around tapes you recorded ( i avoid doing one i am working so i don't mess up time code ) . it really beats membrane control panel my old digital 8 which beginning fail . size camer makes it easy carry put ito your carryn computer bag plane . i shot 15 hours tape three weeks . only times i diappointed when battery died before end long tour day no break return hotel recharging . extra batery bought beijing , i am prepared further excusions . this great camera easy use produces good quality pictures	1
i just recently purchased this camera , haven't chance use it professionally yet . i use it shoot school event my daughter . i shot two cameras picture quality fx1 beautiful(actually too good edit other camera shots ) . i definitely buying second one soon !! only serious videographer this camera would overkill someone looking shoot home videos .	1
every great camera needs great editing software . i am sure most people already know , but all apple editing programs support hdv format this camera natively , without need purchase any additional video cards . this true apple final cut pro hd , final cut express hd even imovie hd ! high definition video this camera edited even ibook new imovie hd right out box . this what i call truely amazing	1
i shopped around while before i bought this camera . i checked out many reviews i say , i'm very happy this camera . i wanted something worked low light . this most important feature i looking . i canon video camera , i now very few videos my daughter growing up because if there wasn't enough light it would make interference tape . this camera works very well normal indoor lighting . you don't turn extra lights . ( it also nightvision which works very low light ) only complaints i 1 ) battery doesn't last more than hour - but i don't video long anyway 2 ) memory stick doesn't hold many pictures - but i'm spoiled my digital camera holding lots . general , i would highly recommend this camera . you download video you pc really easily burn it dvd . oh , some reviews it mentions zoom hard use . i don't find true all . it sensitive , but not hard use .	1
dcr-hc90 fantastic little camcorder performs well all types settings . it might best consumer camcorder recording low/dim light . more information , photos clips , visit my website :( ...	1
i too purchased this camera online . i believe camera itself took quality photos , but upon lense no longer telescoping . i contacted repair line only find out they quoted me $150 repair ! i could not locate my receipt , even though i purchased it new online registered it , they would only say , " no receipt , no warranty " . valuable lesson learned . keep receipt ... nice camera	1
i use camera taking pics our commercial web site photos very good . easy work , light weight , auto-focus works well . manual settings easy figure out too . you don't need install software many computers : just insert card into slot there might already software included pc . also don't need docking station if you media drive . i haven't problems excessive battery consumption nor sudden shutting off . i think many camera brands pulled back quality control favor mass production . if camera fails quickly , you return it . i olympus ( which i loved ) die after couple years repair costs would much new camera . it not just kodak . sure , get extra memory card use .	1
this camera lot fun . it not just snapshots ; many pictures distorted through fisheye lens artistic pictures	1
long time photo nut , holidays , my wife bought me fish eye , gold no less . i shot fujicolor 400 , took pictures my car all kinds crazy angles , streets , people , all shot awarness viewfinder just aid . took film into one hour developer , following instructions , no prints , just negatives put them cd , he , got them home viewed them . they wonderful , little work them picasa 2 converted some black white , it seems like artwork . today queens ny , floyd bennet naval air station , concord taken off deck intrepid now view public , am taking lomo me , should fascinating . my only negative fisheye film advance bit raggedy , but really works fine . i love this camer	1
i've owned powershot g5 better than three years now , while i've never used any lens accessories , i couldn't happier it . i also eos a2 it met all my needs film camera . i thought i would giving up lot when i got g5 go digital , but so far , i haven't disappointed . fact , i've surprised how good g5 ; since i bought my g5 i haven't even once picked up my a2 , let alone actually used it . g5 everything i need it . one only drawback it compared my a2 it took me little while get used longer latency shots ; my a2 i got used lighting fast latency ( a2 built powerwinder goes 6 fps ) so it bit adjustment , but i'm not sports photographer , so i've learned live it . my next camera also canon digital , but i'm going make sure get one that got good latency shots replicates powerwind my a2	1
very nice . attractive stylish . fits purse , very compact . good clasp , well made good leather . places spare chips . not one thing i disappointed . not disappointed any thing case . you pleased this product	1
i nikon user nearly ten years . my first nikon used n70 i loved it . it wasn't until after i read review i learned it supposed confusing , somewhat difficult master , not quite up nikon standards . i loved results loved my nikon camera . when n70 needed repairs cost prohibitive , i purchased its replacement , nikon n80 which all likelihood my last film camera ( i've just purchased nikon d70s ) . n80 best features n70 : automatic mode programs portrait , landscape , night shots , action shots , close up , settings allow manual focus ability set specific apertures shutter speeds , bracketing , red eye reduction . it more features than n60 , but works similar manner omitting some dials n70 seemed confuse many people who used earlier nikon models . it light weight camera excellent . features easy too master it allows person take sophisticated creative photographs . it also sturdy i hope use it many years come . my guess some people reading this review may asking should i invest $300 film camera when i could also purchase digital slr camera just bit more . digital wave future future now , there no question , i mentioned i own digital camera . i believe film camera teaches person more careful photographer . i see lot people take lousy digital shots figuring they erased miss great shots . while it true digital results seen , screen awfully small until images downloaded viewed eth computer , what appears great shot may fact junk . film cameras teach photographer carefully frame photograph if no other reason than film costs money . photography also supposed fun , seeing results film whether it prints or slides fun . also even though photoshop create black white portrait digital shot , nothing ever beat darkroom experience . most serious amateurs professionals i know use both digital film i'm assuming foreseeable future i'll using digital candid shots film scenics , landscapes , nature shots . if you serious taking good photographs looking film camera , nikon n80 excellent choice . it reasonably priced what it offers , easy use , allows opportunity take great photographs . me , it well worth investment .	1
serious student photographer who worked old metal bodied all manual slrs i thought transition automatic camera would difficult . too many cameras market made cheap , lightweight plastic feels like it going crumble my hands . i like camera weight it , but won't require visit chiropractor after day shooting . n80 great this . it very solid construction , comfortable , weighted feel my hands . grips both sides well sized well placed i feel i optimal control all times . thing sold me this camera over similar models its ease use . someone who never wants read instruction manaul , but still wants use bells whistles , this great camera . controls most intuitive i've seen any camera its kind , whether you're your way becoming professional , or you're just starting out , combination versatility ease use perfect . it extemely self explanatory change automatic/program mode , aperture priority , shutter priority . its also easy use timer multiple exposure controls . bracketing , similarly easier . i've camera ofr 6 months enver needed consult instruction book , hopwever there many features i explore book if i so choose . focusing same you get most cameras this price range . focus lock works very well , zones . ; problem focusing low light conditions , but this typical these cameras . overall , i've found this camera perfect blend great price , great variety accessories , utter ease use , bells whistles serious student or amateur or aspiring professional	1
nikon d200 amazing camera . this review amazon packing procedures . this review alert prospective buyers amazon not pack these cameras well . i just purchased one it came packed like book , very little padding . i called nikon their recommendation return item pronto . i returned camera ( much trepidation)and purchase trusted source . just wanted give you all heads up	1
i think point lot people not mentioning d200 quite obvious . let me first say main reason i bought d200 over d80 increase my credibility prestige amateur photographer , make other photographers jealous my kit , brag obscene amount money i spend camera equipment while my co-workers can't even pay their rent . i bought grip because i thought it looked really cool , it increased size visibility my camera other people . question really sold me d200 : strangers i might want photograph more likely say yes standing other side d80 or d200 ? people less doubts me holding this thing opposed smaller model ? which one looks cooler ? if i completely loaded would i buy d2xs ? without second thought . course i talked lot camera people making minimum wage hoping they would some technical insight purchasing nikon or other camera . course they let me down said lot bogus things me most saying something like : " d200 way much camera me . " none them knew how change exposure settings , they contented wheel " child mode , " top d80 recited this me several times if i looked like soccer mom . usual i offended human experience buying real world , especially atrocious mark up several hundred dollars , i refused help pay those employees wages . breaking point i think time associate instructed me buy one camera over other because , " when she dropped this camera it broke other one didn't . " so i turned internet where i only say hi ups man he leaves . i studied studied all things technical , sometimes just staring pictures cameras long periods time without blinking . i poured over thousands photographs taken all kinds cameras amassed photographic library while i decided . basically i went way overboard let decision buying camera engulf my life until i dreaming it . so one night i just bought d200 after fence over d80 or d200 . after two days it arrived i impressed it . thing literally cold hard photographic machine . after broken d50 i firstly impressed size , then secondly all dials switches change things i used dig through menu get . thirdly i liked blazing fast 2 frame rate . when i go out night i snap 50mm f/ 1.8 onto it crank iso up . lot people forms complaining noise high iso d200 but i thought it fine . i feel most people camp want perfect clarity all way up into highest isos but i think artistically limiting . i read one scathing review written veteran film user saying basically high iso digital lot less graininess than film basically saying d200 step up but some people still want complain . far d200 goes versus d50 iso 1600 it leaps bounds better my opinion . noise way reduced without nr there isn't pixel chunkiness i found d50 high isos . thing stands out d200 enhanced colors . reality ultra vivid setting d200 makes lot things look sort fake , but it make people who don't sun tan look like they one which plus my opinion . it make your dull green lawn look like lush paradise , skies ultra blue , reds spectacular . i remember when i used d50 i would steer away photographing violets red roses because it would blow them out , not so d200 . some reason coming point shoot it always used annoy my d50 didn't bw or sepia . d200 bw but no sepia . nerds forums would just say , " use cs2 , or photo editor , " but i say no because i should able everything camera . viewfinder so awesome . i literally hated electronic viewfinders d50 viewfinder so small it hindered my framing times . d200 big bright viewfinder huge lcd sucks down batteries like nothing . far my evolution goes photography sometimes i feel like i literally climb into viewfinder because its so big compared what i used . like i said grip awesome i really like it . i kind like many accessories possible kind steered me away d2xs into d200 . watching percentage marks count down batteries drain always fun . best thing d200 little things like because they make me feel like i greater control over my pictures because i know exactly how many i take . conclusion buy d200 over d80 i am really happy it i am not happy anything . if you're trouble considering what you want photographically try pull yourself away forums outside sources really consider what got you into photography first place where you intend go it , i think important part . advertising gear collecting never made anyone better artist	1
all three items worth , package represents good value - but these three don't always play well together . obviously , digital camera , it always pays spare battery keep you shooting when other goes flat . leather case also worthwhile well-made , providing impact scratch protection , particularly important keeping lcd screen good shape . oddly , cut-out case flap isn't really large enough metal strap pass easily through . thr strap rather stiff while it forced through , rectangular juncture near its end just too large . but leaving it inside case flap against end camera virtually guarantees it'll grinding away camera finish while transit . truthfully , metal strap looks great , works well ultra petite digital elph models , but extra weight s-series mean strap begin biting into your neck over time .	1
after opening box charging battery , i it shooting without cracking user manual . easy use confidence-inspiring . menu system mostly self explanatory , only changes i made put it xp ( highest ) quality mode , 4:3 instead widescreen aspect ratio , disable digital zoom . most options you'd want there . this tiny device , size my 4-yr old 3x zoom digital still point shoot . such , screen size little small , particularly if you shooting 4x3 instead widescreen . case mostly plastic but feels solid nonetheless . sure attach included grip extender tripod socket . this crucial one-handed operation zoom . i like use thumbnails identify each clip . so you delete unwanted clips same way you would delete photos still camera . i pleased image quality . i tested it indoors daylight bulbs fluorescent lights . i didn't see low-light problems some people mentioned , but i wasn't shooting candlelight ... i've heard good things still image shooting so still camera 10x optical zoom nice bonus . i no problem mac connection , just download mpeg streamclip apple $20 mpeg2 plugin , you convert dv format imovie . though some users may find this difficult or annoying .	1
you know what i hate video tapes camcorders ? you never really know where record heads : " if i hit record now , am i taping over something else ? now let see , last time i played back tape , i think i fast forwarded back current record mark ... or i ? ooops , i missed my chance great clip ... again . " hard drive , there no chance recording over older clips . camera always ready record , if battery still charged . yes , battery it comes lasts hour . i never ever my entire life video camera using/owning needed record more than one hour time . when i am not using this camera , it sits camera bag charging off ac adapter . this isnt hard thing , so i dont know why so many people complain battery life . still camera capabilities not too bad really . sure , still pics same resolution first digital camera i ever owned , but i still got some good images ~ 1.3 mp . changing into still camera mode ver easy switch , vs . through gui . i not know cf slot when i bought camera , so very nice bonus me , all our digital cameras use cf well . 30 gigs space nice , but hind sight , better glass lens what this model all when compaired its siblings . i leave video quality highest resolution , occasionaly copy videos my external hdd editing , backups , etc . i got this model video camera because we new baby , i tired putting energy into making sure i wasnt taping over priceless moments . this video camera , fear gone , i am able get capturing our memories	1
great compact battery charger . it relatively fast easy take you when traveling , due it size .	1
found exact replacement charger came camera , shipped me promptly , actually got it quicker than i expected	1
this my 3rd digital camera i bought this one supplement my larger 10x zoom camera . this one fits nicely into pocket or small camera bag easily take it all events or travel . i've found it takes nice photos indoors when flash used .... even when cats or dogs i'm shooting moving around . i've felt life battery set pretty good , but i've using nice rechargeable ones . definitely get set 4 , then you 2 use 2 backup set . settings pretty easy figure out change 99% my photos taken " auto " setting came out pretty good . others indicated , indoors - without flash - produce blurry photos , but that nature almost all cameras , not unique this model . glad i bought it would highly recommend it	1
cute , compact , easy use - these just few ways describe canon cool a400 ! this stylish digital camera lightweight perfect snapping shots go . mine sunset gold . plus , there perks like macro mode ( which lets you snap sharp pictures close 2 inches ) , lots shooting modes ( like snow fireworks ) . movie mode lets you capture video clips sound . this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . just what you would expect canon	1
i've read good reviews this camera this other sites but i am not same experience . quality photos horrible so i started thinking it me i tried it different settings , tried very , very still etc but , i only get one good shot out ten . i fuji 4mp i bought 6 years ago it takes way better pictures than this . i bought this so i could give my old one my daughter but i'm gonna end up giving this one my daughter keeping my fuji . we recently snow here tucson so i took pictures mu fuji compares them canon 6 year old fuji finepix beat it hands down . i don't get it , i get defective camera or am i doing something wrong or this camera just suck	-1
i tried binoculars sent them back . optical quality excellent but distinct cost . binoculars simply bulkier much heavier than other 10x42s i really felt price not justify improved performance . addition , why pay price expensive optics then no good way protect lenses - primary lens covers terribly designed can't stay lenses .	1
this my my 3rd pair binoculars . 1st pair canons they're best i've . better than previous models i've owned . battery consumption much lower . only slight problem flat surface binoculars rest slippery plastic . boat use , bincoulars instantly slide if you put them down . this easily cured gluing non skid material . i would buy these again	1
this my first camcorder i am very pleased it . i thought purchasing dvd or hd based camcorder , but stuck time tested mini-dv version . this one great . video looks good , zoom cool stabilization works like charm . only complaint packaged battery . i purchased one lasts 6 hours long compensate short battery life one it came	1
only knock these binoculars image unsteady , but that product 16x magnification , so it not really product fault . if you've got steady hand , you'll love these things . great sporting events or theater , great bang buck . highly recommended	1
this case fits camera snugly ( but not tightly ) , fit purse or fanny pack perfectly . not plan carrying accesories this case ; it camera only , but big memory stick long life batteries , what else you need . there nice belt loop back case well clip swivel . also included extra long lanyard . i'm totally happy this case	1
this very elegant well-made all leather camera case your fuji f30 presumably , f20 . it nice stitching dark chocolate brown / espresso color . i gave it 4 stars because it not quite " slim " it could - it could tad more " form-fitting " imho . contrary other reviewer , it much bulkier than my neosprene case i using but again , its elegance set it apart . second , magnetic enclosure doesn't seem quite " strong " i would like . overall , i'm pleased but just realize it add bulk ! it not come wrist strap	1
after much research i finally found binoculars fit my every need . price right , delivery right schedule , product excellent	1
i bought this reduce vibration celestron cpc1100 . it seem help some but not noticeable you would think . it help getting scope level since pads wider base than tripod legs when placed soft ground . i sometimes leave them out when i take telescope inside so i repeat my viewing same location following night ( lots trees my backyard )	1

this bag very small . my canon 20d fits nicely small lens , but you cannot fit more than one lens camera body . we kept bag informal use when we only need body one lens avoid always carry bulky bag	1
when i received camera i thought giving it 5 star because good looking nice picture . after 6 months use , i wish i could give it 0 star . it true it looks good but it very hard hold camera . it droped twice when i took pictures . also lens too small . dirt very easy get onto lens very hard clean b/c it small . thanks dirty lens , picture quality worse than ever . battery very small too . after 6 months use , it not hold enought power shoot 10 pictures ! they put buttons here there fit small space . it not user friendly camera .	-1

polarizing filters used eliminate glare non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they also used increase contrast color saturation your image . i use my polarizer not only eliminate glare , but also make skies nice shade blue or get some " pop " out clouds . there so many options consider when purchasing polarizing filter your needs . instance , linear vs . circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs . price . if you making use ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers designed work those features . linear polarizers their uses , but they manufactured differently may not work . unless you certain , just get circular polarizing filter . there some digital circular polarizers market . i am not sure what makes cir-pl lens better digital opposed film . i use canon 20d digital slr see no problems caused using supposed non-digital filter digital camera . most time , when it comes filters ; you get what you pay . mean you need expensive polarizer ? course not , just sure get right filter your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it color neutral prevent unwanted tinting . spending more color balanced filter save time post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money using step down rings . currently i use hoya pro1 filters , canon polarizing filters i previously owned without question bulkier heavier . weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items backpack all extra bits weight add up quickly . i spend good amount time my equipment my back so this big concern me . when it came down images , times i would see browning tint my photos . tint easy clean up photoshop cs2 , but i don't see problem hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it canon , it must quality . " since then i replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes cost disadvantages other similarly priced filters . pros : used film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections ghosting cons : bulky heavynot neutral color balance	1
description or product wrong . there no quad independent power/charging indicators . they set up banks two . one light two charging bays . batteries must charged banks two . tried e-mailing vidpro additional info this charger . e-mail came back undeliverable . cannot find any reviews internet this charger	1
this camera worked very well until lens got jammed its extended position . i sent camera warranty service ( i it less than 7 months ) , they refused honor warranty because it bit scuffed little decorative ring end lens attached 2-sided tape come off . they claimed this happened due physical damage , but this occurred during normal use : i just changing modes lens didn't retract . don't bother trying get warranty service unless unit looks brand new . even then , don't surprised if they renege warranty . i a410 very same thing ( lens got jammed ) , but stolen break-in before i sent it out service ( so i suppose it no loss after all ) . obviously there design flaw causes lens extend too far come off track inside . short , this camera not suitable frequent use field . if you buy it , plan use it lot , expect buying camera or paying repair should covered under warranty ( which i'm not doing ) soon .	-1

this item either not coated or single coating thus any time sun hits filter , it produces flare picture . furthermore , after doing more research it turns out these uncoated or single coated filters cause up 9% light loss vs multi-coated filters like hoya s-hmc or b+w mrc filters . polarizer effect itself , i think it amazing you owe it yourself least try it nice sunny day . ( sky foliage look completely different alive	1

ok , i imagine if you forked over $900 this baby you would not want me telling you you got bad deal , but i am going say it anyway . this little baby way over priced , not mention you need lot more than just this make it work . you need wireless router !! so rather than just complain , let me tell you what i want canon it maybe we start revolution ! cf cards 12gb range it doesn't make sense you would need this capacity reasons ( i know those you biggest brightes 16mp shoot jpeg raw highest settings just laughed me ) , however where this item worth it if you want immediately see your shots big screen or computer without take shot , take out card , etc . what i want bluetooth compact flash card . they make these so i know it possible . i would like canon offer support these compact flash cards so i immediately sync my bluetooth computer my bluetooth camera . now would make it so when i am studio or shooting wedding , i mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending card i don't drag wireless router i saved myself $700 . get it canon - i am waiting !!!	-1
like reviewer , my experience mixed . i use this remote d50 . sometimes remote works , then it goes strike . then suddenly it works again . same distance angle camera . i changed battery - same result . i hardly use it anymore because it so unreliable	1
i got it just today used it cleaning my lens . solution might useful , blower useful , swabs useful their pointed tips , but so called " magic cloth " anything but magic . it kept leaving lint my lens	1
yes , i agree previous review . it doesn't seem make any difference reducing lens flare light sources . it doesn't seem extend far enough actually anything . if it less expensive i wouldn't mind much , just chalk it up extra protection . but seems all it good	-1
i love canon products i complete canon system 10 years . i love everything canon . however i not understand canon reasoning behind producing this lens . reason ef-s lenses offering wider angle getting rear elements lens closer " film " plane . they cannot this film full frame sensor cameras because mirror larger would hit rear elements ef-s lens . they indicated , however , 35 mm advantage gone . why then they produce 60 mm macro lens when they already their macro requirements covered they current three lenses ? i would guess short back focus makes lens cheaper ; but this lens only $60 short excellent 100 2.8 usm macro . i said , if $60 i get lens 40 mm more reach ( 66 1.6 crop cameras ; useful macro photography ) works all canon cameras , i'm not going thinking this lens all . granted , you might not thinking buying ff camera anytime soon , but canon indicated eventually they ff all their dslr , so why bother this lens ? 17-85 or 10-22 very reasonable offerings ef-s lineup , but 60mm macro doesn't make any sense me.my $0.0	1
when i opened package , i found filter box seals ( one each side ) broken , indication it not new . i thought it ok long glass clean clear . when i opened filter box , three pieces , ring , glass circular clamp , jumped out . while it bad sign , i still thought it ok long i could put them together . well , glass not clear , if it sanded middle fine sand paper ( i never saw any filter or lens shape before ! ) . before ship it back , i try put three pieces togather ( so next person not see these pieces jump out when open box ) . guess what , circular clamp 2-3mm longer two ends couldn't meet !!! i couldn't image any scenario under which this could happen , since it amazon , not some unknowns ebay ( actually , any ebayer worry feedback ) . i really shocked amazon shipped garbage its customer ! hope this just random incident amazon very easy return practice . otherwise , i would not buy anything amazon	-1
they tell you tha this product holds 6aa batteries , works 20d battery grip , but when i received item it completely different product not work 20d bg-e2 grip . it product name cpm-e3 , just stated ... but it accepts 8 aaa batteries doesn't even come close working bg-e2 .	-1
i purchased canon powershot s500 digital elph last march . i kept getting blurry pictures so i called canon technical support . they went through whole procedure make sure my camera all set up . well i followed their directions but everything way it should . so they said i should send it because there obviously problem it . then i sent it pay shipping there . they sent it back said they switched out some optical thing . well i just finally went get my pictures developed they all same problem . they never fixed problem . mind you this approximately 9 months my son life before age 2 . i called tech support ended up wait more than 24 hours call back supervisor . she said they would send me pre paid envelope check out camera . well i greatful tell her during babysitting late august little boy dropped my camera so there damage outside part camera , but it not effect quality pictures because they same prior day it dropped . she said they would probably not cover it due fact it might caused dropped camera . i told i proof when it happened pictures prior date coming blurry just like it before i sent it first time . i started cry my son 9 months all ruined she practically laughing when i got off phone . camera worse than disposable camera . don't waste your time or money this piece junk . i recommend olympus . my olympus prior this only 3 megapixels better quality than this piece junk . i am planning contacting better business bureau regarding this matter . please don't waste your time this , like i ! i hope this helps people make better choices ! good luck ! i wish someone could forecasted this me	-1
i owned several canon digital cameras like them very much . i purchased a520 gift family member . after several months lens cover problem everyone writes started happening . it would stick paritally open or closed or all way open . key word stick or stuck . i took it canon service center they repaired it under warranty . after trying use it 1st time several weeks later lens cover stuck open would not budge . i took it back service center they repaired it again . while looking paperwork after repair they stated courtesy repair only not under warranty . it under warranty 90 days date they not repair it first time . after emailing canon they said just email them if i problem they would see what they could . very poor . i like canon digital cameras but wish i never purchased a520 . i bought it because it low price , which big mistake	-1

i admit i'm far expert digital cameras . i take over 32,000 photographs 35mm cameras over 20 years . i purchased 510 powershot july 2005 . it wasn't too long before zoom cameras lens wouldn't work . i contacted canon over this you believe this company audacity charge me shipping their faulty camera back them . i understand them saying , ' we'll charge you first , but once we establish fault due us , we'll then reimburse you back . ' i enclosed type written letter camera asking canon contact me when they received my camera ( mail ) i also asked they contact me when it shipped back . ( i also emailed them same request ) . neither my wishes ever fulfilled canon behalf . itself enough me i've bitter ever since . i've also told every person i've met who wanted buy digital camera this incident . i'm pleased say , i've steered most away this company . what else i say this camera : this camera slow times after its taken picture . i've missed out some good shots due this . it eats batteries like there no tomorrow so one must rechargeable aa even make this camera worth its while . i've not used other digital cameras so maybe they all this way but if i take 3 minute movie ( this camera ) my home during day go outside , most things outside very white . almost like looking infra red photograph . when filming outside , when one goes inside during day , everything dark . like i said , maybe all digital cameras this way ? i wouldn't recommend this camera or anything canon makes if you want my personal opinion . think . you pay shipping camera that barely few months old still under warranty . that disgusting , that all i say . there should zero this , not 1 star	-1

i deeply dissapointed this lens hood . given cost 10% cost lens which it intended ( 70-300 this case ) i expected it stiff durable polycarbonate . -positives-fulfills basic function lens hood- prevents flare , etc . bayonet locking system excellent , much easier deal than scew-on type lens hoods . that it . -negatives-the polycarbonate so thin i half expect it translucen t.t he hood must gripped base remove it , grippng thin end hood may break it ; or least it feels like it may break it . its very long . especially 70-300 which already long lens , this makes fully extended zoom foot long . that pretty conspicuous . it very overpriced vs . generic lenses ($50 vs . $5-10 rubber or metal ) . i traded it went kalt rubber lens hood . 2 stars great bayonet design , but rest it weak	1
i got this my s70 . first off , order use it , you set s70 " radio control " ( 9 button pushes ) . then you better stay no further away than six feet or so ( only * front * camera-the remote doesn't work rear ! ) . oh , if you want adjust your framing , forget i t-t he zoom immobilized . if you need " cable release , " i strongly suggest simply using self-timer built into camera . it gives you 2-second 10-second settings , you're almost certain steady tripod time .	-1

after few months use camera got persnickety , often demanding upon startup i restart it . now camera completely broken down , lens fully extended stuck place , i think this sign too-delicate lens mechanism beginning deteriorate . durability issue concerns finish : plastic coating 4-way rocker switch back controls image review , flash , etc ., quickly wore off , there other small scratches all over body camera . not big deal itself , but annoying given other problem . lens prone strange flaring , especially indoors , where lights room often up large white blotches various points frame . several photos ruined , or required tedious photoshopping . otherwise , lens fine reasonably sharp , although nothing write home abou t.t he camera seems hunt autofocus lock more than some comparable models , e.g. , canon a610 . many frames motion-blurred , well . there ways avoid this , but i didn't buy point-n-shoot fiddly controls menus order mess around aperture-priority exposure , thank you . there few things recommend it : not only it relatively inexpensive , it lens significantly wider than competition -- 31 or 32mm equivalent vs . 35mm . those few mm make big difference when you can't move back far enough get everything frame . it also quick its operations ( except when hunting focus , see above . ) jpegs it cranks out extremely colorful -- bright red so much so details sometimes seems lost -- but generally everything looks good . skintones good . still , durability issue , this one not worth it . lucky me , unlike other user who seemingly experienced same type breakdown , i keep receipt . anyone wanna buy memory stick pro duo	1

i bought this camera my wife we find it unusable . problem flash recovery time which takes good 5 seconds . during this time camera view finder goes black you cannot use it . because camera so slow , we missed many important pictures our children ; consequently , we found any important family events , this not camera we use . i own nikon 35mm slr cameras i am shocked nikon would sell this unusable product . if it your life your recording , i recommend you buy different camera	-1
i bought htis amazon , troubles playing back video clips . almost evrytime , after while , i see " system error " screen , then firmware hung . after power-cycle , last recorded clip gone ! some issues basics ... so i called sanyo service , they said this happening because i'm using 4gb plain sd card . acc support guy , max 2gb plain sd supported , more gb , sdhc card needed . i could not find this info manual or spec ... so i'm not sure how true this . if anyone you know this , please let me know . video okay my need ... still too bad . firmware just average .. not too great . there much scope improvement more user friendly more informative lesser use buttons . battery not perform promised spec . also , there way too many components box such specialized product . i would expect those many robotics kit .	1
if you got here looking bag xacti camera , keep looking . this bag too small . it used holding memoery cards batteries , but not much more .	-1
after week using this i find motor noise others talk nothing . mine refurbished model tigerdirect , so maybe motor already fixed :-) my mother law camcorder sounds like blender . zr 500 ok low light , but you adjust exposure manually correct if it isn't your liking . you also adjust focus too ! my friend who mini dv guru said this end consumer spectrum this camera par . i've made two practice dvd ( firewire , no problem all ) this camera like what i see . those you bad motornoise : try your video software edit noise out . power director feature . i am happy this product , but i would rather higher end model now i bit more my budget camcorder . great camcorder beginners !	-1
beware this camera ! camera overall works great . we it more than year now it takes clear , bright pictures very easy use . very nice compact size . however , others pointed out , battery fatal flaw this camera we looking non-elph replacement fear we run into same problem again . there no battery meter until it needs recharged or replaced . we warned this so i thought , no problem , i'd get two batteries ready switch them when charging needed . but what we found out batteries themselves quickly retain less less charge so now , they last only few minutes each before charge needed . i previously thought this problem retaining less charge over time only much older battery designs am dismayed find myself looking camera so soon .	1
very cheap , you tell it fake camera miles away . sure it these features motion detector which makes it move led lights ; but not worth 6 dollars all . stay awa	-1
i purchased this wide angle lens my digital camera . when i experimenting it taking photos inside my house , there dark shadow lower right hand portion photo . when i took photo outside , there no shadow . i went my local camera shop ask help this matter he said i would need adjust white balance according light room , but he said , reality , ' these digital cameras really not meant attachments ' . i experiment light balance , but still no luck getting dark area disappear . flash camera not strong enough compensate area lens blocks . i returned product .	1
after three weeks batteries fails . i buy knew one walmart , less expensive	-1
probably very good case , but not very operatable one field - you undo two closures open camera compartment , strap velcro . shoulder strap not detachable - looks kind silly when you trying use belt strap . olympus stylus digital cameras , look lowepro case - better case value	1
if you actually get picture turn out right , it take pretty decent pictures . most time photo either over-exposed or too dark grainy . it also only holds 5 pictures , so you buy memory card if you want really use this alot . i little disapointed it due fact it cost 40 dollars , it doesn't really seem worth it	1
i bought this camera after reading reviews wanted get camera uses different media type other than smartmedia ( which only lasts month ) . i would say i am extremely disappointed , particularly grainy images completely out focus edges . even all settings highest possible quality powershot sd1000 , my old olympus camedia c-2020 takes much better photos . it incredible how blurry edges surprised why no one mentioned it so obvious , especially other reviewer pro photographer . so blurry i use photoshop crop out left right sides . right side worse than left making 1/8th entire image unrecognizable . maybe i simply got one bad lens . any case , no thanks , i'll stick my trusty old camera . i would rather pay new smartmedia card each month .	1
this battery not fit camera i purchased . camera comes battery , so why you try sell me one , one not fit , no less ? i returned battery but not heard back you return . it two weeks	-1
my title says it all - i really disappointed this camera , but before i get into specifics why , i must mention few things first . this my third camera exilim line - prior purchasing z850 i owned z60 , well z600 . both great cameras . i mean , what not like ? clean , sexy look ; easy use ; great picture quality . but work kodak past , i decided i want get more involved world digital photography post processing , order i needed something little more manual control , so i sold my z600 , got z850 instead . big mistake ! i ordered it directly amazon , it brand new camera . right bat i got defective unit ! problem - it very inconsistent taking sharp pictures , especially close-ups . shots blurry most part , colors bit off well . how quality reliability ?! but i thought myself , " it okay , it happens " , so i returned it back amazon ( thanks their great return policy ) , got myself one , this time techtoysforless ( it lot cheaper comparing amazon ) . one thing aware - techtoysforless sells what it called " grey market " cameras . i knew it ahead time , but someone might not , then unpleasantly surprised . those who don't know what it - " grey market " refers flow new goods through distribution channels other than those authorized or intended manufacturer . only new products fall under legal , accepted definition grey market . grey market goods sold outside normal distribution channels companies which may no relationship producer goods . frequently this form parallel import occurs when price item significantly higher one country than . this situation commonly occurs cigarettes electronic equipment , such cameras . entrepreneurs buy product where it available cheaply , often retail but sometimes wholesale , import it legally target market sell it price which provides profit but which below normal market price there . so , product legal , it new , it cheap . but ... some instances , there could minor differences " authorized " product , " grey market " one . example , " grey " z850 doesn't ebay mode , but offers " auction " mode instead . it bit different respect settings . also , there no full blown manual box , but rather short " how " instruction various languages . however , full manual found cd-rom . difference , that actually plus i think , it comes european power adapter , whereas american sold models don't . biggest concern " grey market " products , however , some cases manufacturer refuse honor warranty , so you aware , check before buying . i knew all above , but still took chance , mainly because price difference significant , but also because techtoysforless 10-day return policy , i thought it would enough time me " explore " camera find out whether it defective or not . any case , i placed order , three days later held new z850 my hands . i didn't waste any time , when battery fully charged , i started taking shots left right . all them crisp , clear , sharp , so i knew unit good , lens wasn't defective it previous one i . however , i noticed it right away because i tend take mostly pictures people , colors bit " warm " . what i mean there slight cast " pink " present all pictures . you wouldn't notice it pictures architecture , food , or nature , but people skin tone looked somewhat unnatural , it very obvious . neither z60 , nor z600 problem . i still kept camera though because i could take care it doing some minor editing/post processing . what finally made me gave it up ( i sold it ebay ) , casio ignorance unresponsiveness fact it " broken " movie mode . original firmware , version 1.0 , camera came problem " stair stepping " - movies " jerky " , " noisy " . after numerous complaints customers , casio released two new firmware versions , 1.1 , 1.1 supposedly " fixed " movie issue . but what they fact just " cripple " it - movie angle cut 40% version 1.1 , picture quality actually got worse ! version 1.1 didn't actually fix anything , but rather " improved " already decent picture quality , added support high capacity memory cards . also , i've heard lot people even if those cameras function properly beginning , there big chance they brake later due poor quality . i didn't want wait find out , so i got rid off it . i didn't my usual pros cons type review this case , above comments it might seem like there nothing positive this camera , but it actually few good things . one , addition its big , super-bright display , it viewfinder ! big plus my opinion , especially when shooting outdoors direct sunshine . also , top its numerous preprogrammed best shots , it some manual controls , giving you even more flexibility . it nice little camera . unfortunately , it lacks two important departments - quality reliability . i wish i could say i enjoyed using it , but it more hassle than fun . however , i still stand behind casio products . after i sold z850 , i got myself p700 model , which discontinued some time now , virtually impossible find anywhere . it semi-pro model , offers even more manual controls than z750/z850 models . excellent camera ! true performer ! built like tank , sharp canon lens , made japan change ! ( all other exilim models made china , which could reason poor quality ) i've used p700 couple months , ... sold it :-) yep ... call me crazy , call me whatever you want - i just decided i want even more manual control flexibility , so i got myself panasonic dmc-lx2 . one word - wow ! what camera ! optical image stabilization , wide angle leica lens , raw format just name few many features this truly great little gem camera . i've it only 2 days now , but i'm already love it . don't forget check my review it , which coming shortly . i didn't completely abandon casio though - my present my wife valentine day this year - casio ex-s770 red color . i'm definitely going get my hands it also , so come back review soon . once again , i hope i've provided you some help your camera purchasing decisions . good luck	1
i can't speak how well product performs because mine doa . customer service unable anything over phone . since it purchased gift i time before christmas , i opted different brand . doesn't inspire confidence their quality control when unit fails start up fresh out box	-1
i bought this recharger kit specifically sandisk m230 mp3 player . when i first received kit , i charged all batteries . upon first use i only got 7min . out each battery , when i got 20 hrs . batter sent player . i learned online batteries still their charge , but due battery " memory effect " or " voltage depression , " my player thinks batteries lost their charge after only 7min . if you buying batteries electronic device detects how much " juice " left battery , not buy this kit	-1

i searching reviews nikon coolpix s7c make sure it wasnt just me - i am finding indeed countless other reviewers same problem , many taken it up nikon only told ' sorry ' . nutshell , i am professional photographer owned dozen digital cameras ranging early elph nice new slr models . i purchased nikon coolpix s7c my wife , it far worst one i owned many reasons , but chief problem they simply screwed up way this camera things automatically result horrible pictures . ' electronic vr ' simply digital image sharpening , iso adjustments low light terrible , what i simply cannot believe how terrible autofocus . couple design this camera makes it difficult shoot steadily , you literally end up getting more than 50% blurry pictures	-1
i really don't know how write " helpful " review this camera , i'm not photographer ; all i say i not satisfied my purchase , so ... *** if you're trouble deciding which digital camera get ( like i few months ago ) , save your time effort start looking other cameras . *** here my complaints : flash too strong ( blinding , fact ) . please not take this complaint lightly , flash brighter than you think ( it actually hurts , i'm talking physical pain here ) . i actually fear it might some long term effects , this alone deal-breaker me ! it beyond me how this got past testing stages nikon . sure , you turn flash off . but only brings me my other major complaint ! lighting must almost perfect if you want take semi-decent picture without flash . lens not respond well artificial lighting , all , pictures either come out all grainy ( if it slightly dark ) or huge white patches all over if there lot light background . even when lighting almost perfect , you lose lot quality ( even when using highest settings , 6mp ) . scene modes didn't help much , i tried everything , all different modes offer so little difference , very gimicky my opinion . even if you want endure pain suffering mighty flash , there chance pictures come out somewhat unclear , why ? i no clue what so ever . i might take same exact picture same exact conditions settings minute apart slightly different pose ( but still stable ) , one would blurry while other crystal clear ! must admit though , swivel design very practical makes things so much easier . video mode great well . if you don't mind inflicting serious pain onto yourself others via blinding flash , then i must admit , pictures come out nicely . ( most time	1
this camera great first very easy use , however , condensation error many others seem came true us well . when we first got error it not anywhere near any water or moisture , so we put it our cedar chest ( we keep our house very dry don't live humid area - nebraska ) . this worked few months , but error now permanently camera useless . i wish it different , but bottom line , this disposable video camera - nice one , but still disposable	-1
not worth $10 i paid especially when i spend $7 ship it !!	1
this alright camera . if you're average teen looking post some hot pictures myspace , or just someone looking capture few choice family moments , this camera should serve you fine . what i liked it : 1 . it compact , lightweight easy enough use2 . pictures taken daylight turn out pretty nice3 . battery life this camera much better than other cameras i've usedwhat i disliked it : 1 . it bit flimsy honest2 . attempting take picture afternoon , evening or early morning near impossible without it looking completely washed out or too dark . even though it night landscape option , it doesn't really work . 3 . flash causes horrible delay ( but that mentioned like 9,000 times before)this definitely not camera glamour shots . i'd also strongly discourage buying it if you're thinking using it take pictures music events	1
this frame looks great until you turn it . picture quality less than stellar , but isn't what annoyed me this frame . when you buy this frame don't expect view your photos 16:9 ratio without some work photo manipulation program . what mean you ask ? means your photos won't fill entire screen 4:3 mode . you 2 black bars either side your images ; this not take advantage entire frame . if you switch 16:9 mode your images stretch width frame , making peoples faces distorted . i workaround those who familiar image manipulation . see below . build quality frame pretty good . if mustek would fix 16:9 problem get better quality screen , this would nice little frame . little work evolved setting up pictures 16:9 ratio , but i figured it out . 16:9 stretches image , making it look distorted . these steps compensate stretch make your images appear normal . i set up macro photoshop allowing me batch one click mouse . you just need keep eye out how it crops image . some your images might better served one time . start image 1024x768 your image editing program . 1 . go image size menu change width image 77% ( or 788 pixels ) this make image look distorted . ok . 2 . then go canvas size menu crop height image 77% ( or 591 pixels ) image ready save . you might want save folder so youcan go back your original if needed . 3 . copy your edited images flash card insert into frame	1

picture quality okay , but battery life horrible	1
loved concept this camera ... small , 10x zoom sleek looking , but first one lasted 3 days , it replaced second one lasted 1 week . both stopped operating completely . so given kind problem i not recommend this camera	-1
i several people take my pictures . first , everything fine . pictures ok . next day , my face looks like pile baby vomit . it soooo blury . then it got 2 point where every picture i took blury . i tried fixing it online(like program camera)and it would not work . i hate this camera !!! not mention battery sucks . it lasts maybe 3 1/2 hours . this camera should $99.00 . trust me people ...... if i could rate this thing zero i would . it not worth it . however , camera i absolutely love sony cybershot dsct5 . awesome little camera	-1
i purchased wp-dc700 underwater case my a70 followed directions exactly , oiling gasket cleaning it after each use . it leaked ruined my month old camera . customer service rude , blamed me then tried bargain me fix it $190 instead $280 they initially requested . underwater case 7 day waranty camera not covered water damage . my father similar problem his $1000 nikon digital which just stopped working no aparent reason , they claimed it water damage tried bargain him buy rebuilt one $500 . so beware bad customer service . canon customer service all bad unreasolved reviews better business burea	-1
main reason buying this camera able take good pictures far away . quality very poor . unit very bulky carry around your neck . sd card slot some block it . i not able even insert sd card . all all , not satisfied all	-1
i read all reviews comments this kodak printer i could find . many gave glowing reviews . i'd just purchased new kodak digital camera , thought this printer dock would make perfect setup . i never able get printer perform kodak says it should . it caused some odd conflict , my computer would not boot into windows xp printer attached computer . i ended up disconnect printer , turn my computer , then reconnect printer order use it . windows then always reinstall printer drivers . it made even more frustrating kodak tech support . i called emailed multiple times assistance . one conversation i literally told " i don't know what wrong can't help you . " now that tech support ! finally printer refused print telling me it out paper . i tried all kodak remedies , none worked . no matter how much or how little paper machine , it said there no paper . i even opened fresh pack find it still fussy not let me print . i can't recommend this printer . i could give better recommendation kodak itself , through its tech support , least provided my some competent assistance . i got 2 dozen prints , quite large cost printer supplies few prints before machine just failed work all . only positive i give prints i get looked good , color nice . i gave it extra star print quality alone . kodak name some strength behind name once upon time . it synonymous home photography once upon time . they've lost something over years , quality	1

my experience , this camera takes great pictures , but zoom lens so delicate it breaks easily . it stops extending just makes clicking noise . this happened me when camera accidentally turned while my pants pocket rendering camera unusable . my brother two my friends experienced similar problem their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped camera while lens extended . i would recommend looking into camera not so delicate	1
i bought sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder week ago . i surprised sony not provide downloads associated software named " digital voice editor " . sony customer service staff told me if you lost cd came box , you buy new one . only patches software available download . customer service personnel told me it corporate policy despite fact software bound digital device . this immoral policy violating norm digital appliance industries should not encouraged . sony demoting its brand name offering poor post-sales services . think twice before making your buying decision .	-1
this camera/mp3/camcorder/webcam/voice recorder way good true ! i brought one because it cute looked perfect mini movies . but i sadly mistaken ... this camera just takes cheap pictures videos . only thing actully worked properly voice recorder i no need . after 3 days trying make it work little better i gave up sold it ebay same price i brought it . it great idea ... but it just isn't good camera but if you want voice recorder this pretty nice . mp3 player isn't all wonderful either . it doesn't work itunes . or easy work windows . hope this helps ... i wish i would read this before i brought this camera	-1
i bought this camera because i'm going jamaica i needed camera , video camera bonus . when i first tested it , it during night time , however well lit room , but i couldn't see anything . i figured i could deal long it took good pictures during day . when i stepped outside , which very bright sunny , all i could see screen white . i tried all settings still encountered white screen . only time i actually saw anything my screen when i inside during day . i brought it back right away , thankfully i bought it wal-mart they happy refund my money . i hope anyone reading this review take my advice not buy this video camera . i would loved give it zero stars if amazon gave option	-1

i no longer own my previous much finer camcorder , so i finally found myself market purchasing some kind camcorder until i could get back my feet get good one . i thought this one may , good price , looks sharp , purchased impulse . . . big no-no . i say camera takes decent pictures ( previous reviews state , almost exclusively outside broad daylight or indoors withvery good lighting ) . other than , don't bother . mp3 cutefunction ( quite possibly most practical ) . video , uhh , let'snot even go there . voice recorder , also not bad - records wav format transferred pc . jack all trades , master none . . . i guess would bestway finally describe this item . i say i'll saving up nowfor much better camcorder no more " i just gotta this right now " save your $ , find quality product - even if you pay little more it . trust me , it overall better long run . .	1

loved this camera first month or so i owned it . two years later my feelings very different . batteries need recharged constantly . camera rarely turns after off it dock more than hour . all i get flashing red light signifying batteries dying . zoom worthless , pictures turn out very blurry pixelated . flash also way too bright , half my pictures annoyingly " white " looking because this . definitely going canon my next purchase	1

i bought this camera february 2005 but didn't know enought digital know what i actually get . goes through batteries pretty fast . recharge time pictures sometimes causes me miss good shot . takes way too much time pressing shutter button taking picture . i just thought this normal digital cameras till i began reading later reviews . then i accidentally dropped camera onto soft surface ( loose dirt sawdust)and now lens stuck most way out not retract camera not come . contacted hp get it fix but cost close $100 they just send reconditioned one . so i am market digital camera-maybe canon or sony or something besides hp	1
this camera worst !!! i bought this black friday there many reasons why i am returning this piece junk : 1 . first all , it runs double batteries2 . when i came home i started taking pictures . after i took my first picture , it said error saving image ! 3 . then it worked it didnt work . i tried downloading some pictures actually saved camera onto computer . when i finished downloading them , i looked pics computer . i f0und them but pics all blurry . i so fed up i left it sitting my computer desk next 2 months . not buy this camera , it waste your money time ! i actually thought hp made good cameras ..... -_-	-1
i only it few hours after i knew i would returning it . its video quality quite horrible , just better than videophone average webcam . i should expected it something this small this inexpensive . but honestly , i prepared myself something least better than what this camera . it quality not any better unless your outside , if you like me spend majority time hosting parties wanted something small capture fun , this would not . you basically need spotlights room if you want capture something film instead shadow . this also pain mac users . it says it able import files , yes it , but asf format . now you play it vlc , but think you'll able convert it , think again . it converts just fine , except without audio . i've tried converting video into several different formats all them come out without audio . so , mac users , pick something else . it returned , certain	-1

received dxg-506v yesterday surprised find out it no tripod mount . many sites showed light tripod optional accessories this unit but there no way mount these accessories cam . this kind like false advertising . this no deal me because cam so dark normal indoor lighting situations compared other cams similar prices ( like optimus radio shack sells ) there also no image stabilization . geez , how hard would it put simple � inch plastic mount bottom . sound , built microphone produces too much hiss located place not allow it pick up voices sounds what you shooting . you hear yourself talking great but not person you shooting . pretty bad . resulting audio hiss sounds like cheap 1970 cassette tape recorder . best thing this cam going it it save movies avi , mov or asx format different resolutions which why i got it first place . it also pretty easy learn its buttons functions seem fairly logical . it also lens cap . my advice dxg this . 1 . add tripod mount . 2 . move microphone forward something hiss tinny sound or perhaps add mic jack so i use external microphone . would sweet . 3 . improve cam so it better job normal indoor lighting situations . optional settings nothing improve this . i tried them all . bottom line i would kept this cam if it tripod mount . there just too many situations this comes handy it would allowed me add light cam indoor use .	1
this worst camera i ever owned my life . i fuji 1.3 mega pixle camera took better pictures than this one ! i taken this camera 2 vacations now , both times i brought my olympus slr film camera , both times , olympus pictures clearer , brighter all but maybe 1 work , this stupid sony cybershot , i end up deleting 3/4 pictures because they blury or all kinds funny things happening , only pictures work this camera during day time , or bright lighting . first vacation i went this camera , my friend brought her kodak 1 megapixel camera she got free it turned out better pictures , my olympus , second vacation i returned today i write this , i just downloaded my pictures , deleted 2/3 them because they so bad , ones came off my film camera perfect ! my sister also exact same camera which she brought her , i went through her pictures , same thing over 2/3 them didn't work , i would just assumed i'd gotten defective camera if it only my sony not work , however hers didn't either , i would also assume perhaps it myself problem , however , i took number exact same picture this sony well my olympus ( back up thank god i ) pictures olympus , well every other camera i ever used , come out fantastic , this camera though , they come out horrible , so bad fact i'm embarrassed show people ! believe me , if i hadn't gotten it free present i'd writing nasty letter sony , it though my next camera i'm saving up buying brand nothing but photography equiptment , therefore knows what they're doing . sony makes great tv home entertainment systems , anything else i've bought them , or known someone who , junk , their camera , their car stereos , their computers ! sony should stick tv home theater , it what they're good , camera not so much , unless you're looking something cheap you'd only use day , even then i'd recommend disposable , they even work better than this camera	-1
this needs lot light . i returned this due lighting/picture quality . one nice thing it you record decent video quality memory card-mpeg 4	1
we bought this camera two years ago . we loved using it , until last week . camera showed " e18 " error middle special event . we researched error online found almost anything cause this error , turning camera off while it low battery something front lens while turning it . we're not sure how ours developed e18 ( never dropped or damaged . ) our camera rendered useless canon only response it us mail it $100 repair	-1
i bought this camera mainly use digital macro mode , it worked great several months , now it not lock focus , this camera very frustrating , every picture i take i edit lighten picture , i tried just every setting get pictures come out , no avail , i am commercial real estate appraiser , so i taken close 2000 pictures this camera , just every one i lighten , now macro mode wont work , i not buy cannon product ever again !!	-1
i got dreaded " e18 " error after owning this ( naturally ) just over year . repairs least $100 , repairs only guaranteed 90 days ... even if exact same problem occurs again ! this clearly design flaw ( just read how many users same problem ) . my first photoshot broke after year half , since i liked ease use basic design , i chalked it up bad luck bought . big mistake	-1
this worst camera i've ever owned . i'm not exaggerating . i'm so upset wasting money it . only pictures turn out , outside bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures low light , there high level noise photos . video mode moves out its own , ruining video . i sometimes get colored lines down right side videos . my friend $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .	-1
main reason i ordered this kit battery . when i received it .... no battery included . i contacted amazon all they could give me number sony customer service . thanks amazon !!	-1
i've just returned this camera poor facial image quality after using it extensively months . my regular camera fuji finepix s602z which large bulky , but , takes superb facial shots . i tried casio due needing something small carry my purse special events i'm heartbroken incredible photo opps i've resulted poor facial quality . don't buy this camera if you care what everyone looks like . i've just ordered powershot sd1000 because facial detection feature it . hopefully , it better since i don't want carry my bulky fuji get great facial photos . i'll review cannon once i've it few months	-1
return ? ha ha !!! you must email them permission . they don't provide email address . i spent untold hours trying get them respond . they everything avoid returns . amazon just looks other way . don't it !	-1
i tried trick resizing , but honestly , image quality still abyssmal . images so low-resolution only vaguest detail comes out . please , if you're thinking buying this someone christmas this year , choose something else . it might okay someone low standards or poor eyesight , but anyone who see well knows what good digital image looks like , this huge disappointmen t.t he good news few years these digital keychains advanced offer much better performance - that almost guaranteed . so put this one " must buy mom " list 2008 christmas season . i very seldom write review , only wrote this one keep people making same mistake i	-1
what pile junk . three full seconds pass pushing shutter button when camera actually takes picture . if you move all during three seconds , picture blurred mess . even if you don't move , pictures turn out blurry dark . if you use flash , you get lovely white picture nothing . i can't believe they sell this thing .	-1
i've never ordered anything this disappointed . i ordered two these both didn't work . i contacted company tech support they told me send it back they replace it . i tried contacting ritz camera where i purchased item they refused give me refund . i am now stuck dealing this company horrible customer support . i never buy product this company again .	-1
i purchased this my wife valentine day . installation went fine but i two problems device . first , software picture transfers awful . you only select pictures your computer download - you can't see what photos device software . order delete photos you it manually device itself . i checked webpage updated software - no joy . crop feature nice ( well used ) but otherwise i feel like i am looking windows 3.1 application . second , image quality device very poor . i didn't very high expectations , but this lower than i expected . reminds me picture/screen quality very first color cell phone screens , maybe bit worse . you make out picture , but not much detail all . advice cropping photos only show headshots excellent idea , it only way get decent picture . overall , i'm little disapointed . but then , you get what you pay ..	-1
i would spend little more money buy better quality camera . picture quality not good all . i previously owned kodak camera same megapixels picture quality camera much better . just after year using kodak c300 camera , it stopped working i not use it much . i now own sony cybershot dsc-w50 takes great pictures , i haven't any problems it i using it almost daily basis since may 2006	1
i this camera year half . i got so fed up it i just bought new one . i admit , this camera takes decent pictures good lighting when zoom isn't used . however , this camera takes horrible pictures if zoom used . i would only recomomend this camera someone who just wants take pictures thier surroundings or younger person who getting their first digital camera	1
this first digital camera i purchased . i am adventurous person wanted something would stand up my lifestyle . this camera wasn't it . good*it compact , which pretty convenient*it several camera functions potential work well if you techno-savvy . bad*after snorkeling it 30 minutes , camera leaked broke . olympus replaced it , but only after my 2 month stay costa rica over . * functions unreliable difficult use . rarely if ever i get them work how i want . pictures always need touched up afterwards , sometimes seriously . * zoom sucks . don't expect get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you some serious patience . * image stabilization joke . you need tripod or surgeons hands take pictures aren't blurry . * user manual left me lot questions	1
we use our videocameras tape preschool classrooms observations . hope use microphone isolate conversations . test microphone . i went noisy starbucks , huge lines , moderate music tons conversations . i recorded video cameras mics , then used zoom mic then used gun feature . i aimed microphone barista yelling out coffee orders . all instances , there no difference sound quality . i then went sony style store mall her open different microphone allowed her install it . she read package distance then we listened it all three settings . we could not find any difference . i checked camera instructions there no setting external mic . once mic attached turned , external mic suppose override board mic . i am still insearch gun mic digital camera . many new camcorders hard drives dvd drives not mic input or active interface shoe . i would rather want mic input so i use more powerful mic rather than mercy sony create one their shoe . overall , i am stuck . if i record something interesting i probably try enhance audio portion while editing .

i love my nikon coolpix 5900 however , lens failed less than one year . service took 6 weeks repair . lens failed again after less than 10 days after repair . why lens failing open again ? i absolutely hate inconvenience returning this item again service although i paid plan it . why can't warranty fast , local competent	1

instead this pick up plextor convertor box . it takes output camcorder ( composite/rca or s-video ) compresses mpeg-2 ( dvd ) or mpeg-4 ( or divx ) includes software which easily burns dvd or cd ( mpeg-1 or mini dvd ) . look plextor m402u box . unless you really want deal 3.125 mb data per second ( 25 mbps ) , or 180 mb per minute , or 11 gb per hour through firewire link , get m402u . your options greatly expanded , you won't tell difference looking	-1
i say i really wanted like this camera . it takes good pictures ultra-wide lens nice feature . it quite compact nice screen . software reasonably good nice presentation user interface . why 2 stars ? ok here bad stuff : 1 ) first shipment i got , normal mode ( non-ultra-wide angle ) didn't work . images garbled almost unrecognizable . ultra-wide images fine . i attributed it getting random lemon returned it even exchange . second v570 i got amazon worked fine until 5 months later then normal mode crapped out me . so , i don't think it just random problem . there appears reliability issue non-wide angle part this camera since it seems statistically unlikely i would randomly get two cameras exact same problem . my v570 now nice-looking paperweight i use casio exilim ex-z70 . 2 ) stand seemed nice first until it came time travel . you unhook whole thing lug it around you if you want charge your camera or download pictures movies without card reader dongle . also , since you charge battery camera , you can't charge spare battery while you taking pictures other . comparison , my new casio ex-z70 usb cable easy stick pocket my bag external battery charger . so , if one battery dead i leave it behind charger while i take pictures spare . 3 ) movies you take this camera stored mov format instead avi or mpeg . while it play most pcs if you installed quicktime , it not supported my streaming media player ( d-link dsm-320rd ) difficult work video editor/dvd creator sw i use ( sonic mydvd ) . i can't say how widely mov supported compared avi mpeg , but format created problems me . so , i applaud kodak not clinging sinking boat anchor photographic film business going digital . but i think few more usability studies more attention reliability would help make this winner future iterations	1
bought this xmas present myself - bring family photos while business travel . i'm now 2nd unit ( exchanged directly w/phillips ) , am still same issue it not reliably working external ( my case , sony memory sticks ) . internal memory pitiful , unless you want resize all photos you put it , you not going able hold very many internally . i've yet get auto on/off feature work , while it perhaps pc friendly device , it certainly not always mac friendly - controls cumbersome work , directions meager . i wanted able carry this backpack or carryon bag , fact support stand can't folded tight against unit makes it difficult this - course , no mention this product description . also no mention it only supports older memory sticks - no support new , ms produo sticks ( no mention product descriptions either)i thought i would get quality product phillips , this certainly looked like it potential - unfortunately , it turned out piece junk , one i've screwing around so long it probably not returnable . don't waste your time dollars .......................	-1
this wonderful item if or when it works . it prints pictures beautifully if it works . trouble after using it little while ( i mean little while ) it quit feeding paper lights start blinking saying you out paper you out ink . i messed it messed it , some you who same problems sometimes cleaning feeder roller rubbing alcohol get it work but this doesn't work all time . right now my printer won't work i cleaned roller it very aggravating paper ink aren't cheap . i think it cheaper going down walmart using their instant photo machine . this not worth money or aggravation !!!!	-1
camera operates good , but i thought it suppose new . it looked bit used cracked bottom . it work , but unfortunately all packageing tossed out	1
... but it stopped working after year . only thing lens sees now black , although camera still turns i look pictures i took before problem started . nonetheless , i loved this camera , i think it worth it , even though it only worked year . now i've learned my lesson buy longer warranty or exchange new camera	1
after doing bunch research , i bought two these my teenage kids since they said not defective sony ccd late model 2005 point-and-shoots all seem . first zamera lasted six months before lcd display began worsening exhibit dark striations . after few days , camera dies completely . second camera made it two months before falling prey same disease . one camera . . . fluke maybe . but two ? suggests real problem so beware .	-1
i looking pair roof-prism binoculars like this , hawk bird watching . i looked swarovskis , but they way out my budget , nearly thousand dollars this resolution . these binoculars crystal-clear , sharp focus . 42mm lens lets lots light , lots more than 35 i've using . i wear glasses twist- up- -down eyecups blessing . there also attached lens protectors 42mm , nice because i always used lose them . price , these can't beat	1
i've read good reviews this camera this other sites but i am not same experience . quality photos horrible so i started thinking it me i tried it different settings , tried very , very still etc but , i only get one good shot out ten . i fuji 4mp i bought 6 years ago it takes way better pictures than this . i bought this so i could give my old one my daughter but i'm gonna end up giving this one my daughter keeping my fuji . we recently snow here tucson so i took pictures mu fuji compares them canon 6 year old fuji finepix beat it hands down . i don't get it , i get defective camera or am i doing something wrong or this camera just suck	1
i originally purchased samsung duocam scd6040 . it fortunately broke 1 week before warranty ran out . video began giant pixilated squares when video taping playback . though under warranty , it still cost me $49 ( their fee ) send camera repair . repaired camera came back broken . i deal many customer service people , but finally got them agree mine " lemon " they sent me scd6550 . now 10 months later , video playback this duocam broken . you see black screen yellow blocks lcd through viewfinder . i cannot video tape or playback anything tape . it not under warranty . i can't believe their cameras/duocams don't last longer than one year . they must use cheap parts . please save yourself headache chose brand .	-1
add previous reviewers , i very disappointed this camera performance . i compared " 5 megapixel " photos photos taken my canon , powershot g3 ( 4megapixels ) , scd6550 simply not produce same quality stills . camera itself also seemed flimsy . idea two-in-one camera so attractive . but attractive concept , canon elura50 , offered camcorder compact design . end , however , it broke down only after year half . $500 purchase not durable lifespan ( cf . reviews elura50 you see many hardware problems ) . this camera seemed less durable than elura50 i maneuvered various parts dials . course , i am returning camera before it prove its durability . nevertheless , maybe folks cnet stake their money it . lastly , i should add positioning record button function dials poorly placed . i found i use both hands when switching back forth camcorder still cam modes well simply engaging record button . this definitely takes away idea convinient solution capturing those special moments . again , this camera great idea . but , i suppose we should wait until manufacturers make one both solid hardware quality image recording . this one right track , but , still so far accomplishing quality product .	1
these not pioneer boxes . these mbi boxes . i bought them very disappointed since i also bought pioneer boxes before , when i compared mbi , latter one much less sturdy even index cards flimpsy compared pioneer . not buy these . also , adorama customer service very unfriendly regard making their customers satisfied . they insist they same , i need return them my cost , because their mistake . they flew one reason blame they never carried pioneer products , amazon mistake naming them pioneer . but then their own website also named them pioneer . anyway , just reconsider buying any products this company . it not worth it , considering shipping outrageously high . it my honest opinion .	-1
this scope not good starter scope anyone interested astronomy . here why : 1 . objective too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it too small bring light necessary even beginning look universe . i suppose it adequate moon , but it . planets appear very small disks . one able see saturn rings , but image very small . forget it deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc . 2 . 4mm eyepiece too powerful this scope . observer find it hard look through ( very small eye opening ) , most cases cause blurred images . 20 mm eyepiece only functional eyepiece . barlow 3x , which again too poweerful this scope . 3 . mount vibrate when touched , which cause image eyepiece " shiver " , which very frustrating . even low price , don't enticed this scope ; it too many flaws . save your money larger scope better mount . jim " konedog " koenig , astronomy buf	1

i purchased , through work , powershot s70 july 2005 . i've always owned nikon products personally , but features price s70 swayed me away my usual nikon brand loyalty . 12 months i've s70 , it sent factory twice repairs -- second time just 6 days before warranty expired . first time it sent because lens door failed turn camera it almost come off its track . eight months later , flash quit working all modes door failing again ! flash door problem occurred while i yosemite np , so you imagine disappointment place like camera only half functioning . now , warranty expired i hold my breath every time i slide lens door open . i no faith canon s70 lost lot faith canon products whole . only bright side this experience factory repairs completed within 2-3 weeks , which i thought fast warranty work	1

i received pandigital 7 " photo frame ( dpf70-2 ) christmas gift haven't able get sd card slot function . when connecting pc via usb cable it tells me removable device needs formatted . windows attempts format card fails . i'm able format card usb card reader copy pictures sd card ok . when i insert sd card into photo frame doesn't display any pictures , just blue frame around picture location . i contacted pandigital tech support via 800# never received call back so i sent them email . i received email response back after several days . they me try several things resolve issue ; this troubleshooting process went more than week no avail . they eventually acknowledged photo frame appeared defective , when i asked exchange photo frame ( taking advantage 90 day warranty advertised their site ) , they told me return it store it purchased . i not consider this very good customer service ; i would not recommend this product .	-1
i bought this camera my 13-year old son take him soccer trip bermuda . it ok . felt sort cheap , but seemed like it would what it supposed . big drawback .... there no lens cover slips into place when picture isn't shot , so danger scratching lens immense . my son so afraid scratching lens , he barely used it . some few pictures he take ok , but others not best quality . i think this camera bit too costly what you get , i'm surprised , because i usually love samsung products	1
i two 8 " picture frames other brands , they great i use them open houses all time ! i got this one gift friend , it terrible !! instructions difficult understand . wide screen makes everyone picture look fat distorted ! this weird size i am not happy all !! i don't recommend it	-1
not worth money spent it . after reviewing info my new digital camera i followed suggestions get rechargeable batteries kit save money aa batteries . i not need camera case came this kit , it really too many pockets my liking . batteries not hold charge . i only got few pictures taken before they went dead . if spare set sat camera few days they too dead . least i got full set pictures taken duracell ones . i would much rather buy batteries them hand then always running back charger after few shots . i no experience rechargables before so i not know if this common . but i returned this item defect because this amount money you should get more then six pictures per charge	-1
this camcorder worked well , but i two complaints it . 1 . sound track you hear noise recording head moving back forth , sounds like woodpecker . this alone made it unacceptable or what i wanted . 2 . i wanted high quality video , but since it records small dvd disk , video compressed before it recorded disk . this causes some loss detail picture , especially if you're going edit it rerecord video which i need . if you just want camera record small dvd which you then play dvd player ( not all dvd players play small dvds ) this camera might acceptable . i returned it bought panasonic pv-gs35minidv camcorder which uses minidv cassette tape . much better video quality because its not compressd , no noise tape drive	1
i used this camera once no good photos show it . it took 5 frames then skipped several took 2 more , then nothing rest roll . we swam sharks i nothing show it . should bought disposable one	-1

i purchased this camera my 13-yr old daughter her first digital camera . it christmas present so i am highly dissapointed 3 months after purchase , flash stopped working . picture quality good but it hardly makes up fact she no longer take photo indoors or low light . i would not recommend this camera .	-1
i found case that almost exactly like this one , except it $10 cheaper . it made samsonite . model # tm90blu ( there also black case ) . but like i said , exact same thing . unless you care your camera case saying " lumix " , save yourself some dough get one wal-mart	-1
i keep this frame all day night . lcd backlight should last longer than 4 months but mine just burned ou t.t he quality pictures okay if viewed distance but low res . not good if viewing up close . there no external power controls or remote so turning this unit off drag . regular lcd backlights should last few years even if it stays all day night . this one just lasted 4 months . so image almost non-existant now . glare , you barely make out image so it still there but no backlight so good dead . i would recommend more expensive philips ones . my friend it two years it still going . plus it higher res more controls such timer function also play video clips , which this one can't	1
i bought this product nearby retailer . packaging deceptive . photoframe must plugged into external power source or you must buy uniquely designed battery manufacturer . battery $35.00 shipping , it poorly designed so when installed battery case rubs connector wiring . this frame no on-board memory , so use it you must one two types memory it accepts . this additional expense . after purchasing photoframe i discovered plastic frame chipped device not perform instructions said it should . i took it back store opened eight boxes before i found one which unbroken frame . i took photoframe home discovered device would not work instructions described . i then went retailers ' locations exchange device ( original location shipped their entire inventory back manufacturer ) . retailer very helpful clerks i tested three more photoco photoframe devices , none them worked described ( they would not scroll through album photos ) . i returned item retailer received full refund device , then email i requested refund price battery . photoco replied if i sent them battery they would refund its price . i mailed battery may 6 , then inquired my refund may 14 . photoco replied only employee who could process refund out sick . 3/17 i sent email demanding immediate processing my refund . photoco said my credit processed but i might not see credit 7 10 days . i still not received my credit battery . if you want avoid headach , avoid doing business this company . read other reviews before considering this product	-1
quite unsatisfied this product returning 2 i purchased gifts . fact , recipients asked me return them . main reason , order it " portable " it requires special battery you only buy manufacturer additional $30 . i already spent $100 , not planning spending more money . i think photoco needs rethink their product improve customer satisfaction .	-1
beware poor cs policy jvc . they recently let me down when it obvious camera poorly designed built . they not interested even trying help . i hate it when companies only care their profits	-1
battery good after full charge . it lacks holding promised charge . i find after 2 weeks it questionable , depending how many pictures taken before camera sat waiting used again . i got over 100 pictures when used 3 days , which more my aa nimh 2100mah . which i bought walmart { so probably not super battery } wallmart batteries actually hold charge longer { very sad } . charge time not long when charger half charge . over all , i hope next ones i buy better than these . my solution carry non rechargeable battery my case when delkin dies . i also try give it full charge before leaving house , there no memory effect . i also recomend checking see if there firmware upgrade your camera . every camera shuts off when battery different power level . my nikon coolpix 3100 , seems shut down sooner than later . all reviews should mention what camera they using this reason . using 3 months now .	1
my experience , this camera takes great pictures , but zoom lens so delicate it breaks easily . it stops extending just makes clicking noise . this happened me when camera accidentally turned while my pants pocket rendering camera unusable . my brother two my friends experienced similar problem their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped camera while lens extended . i would recommend looking into camera not so delicate	1
we returned this video camera due video picture quality . camera requires lot light decent video , even after changing settings , video " grainy " look . we just needed something basic replace our 10 year old video camera thought this would work , but picture worse than our previous camera . purchased pv-gs65 , next model up 3ccd love this model . matter fact we still gs-31 , used same tape , shot same footage , reviewing two different shots , gs-65 100% better . camera great feel your hand , although menu button difficult press	1
i extremely disappointed this camera . it shame there no option zero stars , because it doesn't even deserve one . i bought two them vacation belize because we planning lot activities around water , we hoping capture those memories without risk our digital camera . now i really regret not putting little more money into waterproof case our digital camera rather than wasting money this camera developing pictures only worthy garbage . all pictures both cameras very grainy - terrible , terrible quality . camera we took pictures while diving slightly better than one we never even submerged water . those pictures so grainy we couldn't even tell what pictures supposed . extremely disappointing camera wasn't even submerged water . not mention both cameras said there more pictures left roll when there none , so we took shots we thought going really amazing only find they weren't even negatives . i so disappointed this camera i wrote kodak they offered send me two new disposable cameras . unfortunately our trip belize once lifetime trip , so i absolutely no need replacements - damage . i no desire ever use one these cameras again . if you planning using disposable waterproof camera capturing valuable memories , not waste your money this one . only thing you receive photo lab disappointment . i wish i more research before purchasing this one - please don't even bother it	-1
i purchased this camera took it beach . photos so bad , i threw them away . images all washed-out blurry . also , film advancing mechanism very tricky , so several pictures i took overlapped each other . i've used other disposable cameras before wouldn't let you take picture until film fully advanced next frame . this camera , i advanced film until mechanism stopped , camera allowed me take picture . unfortunately , film hadn't advanced fully next picture partially overlapped previous picture i taken . what waste money this camera ! thankfully , i also taken my digital camera , so i still some good pictures my trip :)	-1
i read reviews thought i'd still give it try . after one battery charge , i " lucky " enough defective unit - camera wouldn't start again after first charge . my observations first short use : - quality pictures very poor ( my pentax optio 4mp camera takes better quality photos ) -- very disapointing 6mp camera . - flash generally useless , actually hurt quality- camera very uncomforable if you don't very small hands . my wrist hurt after using it 20 minutes . - video ok , but focus very slow ( noisy ) . - i same problem several others -- camera died shortly afer getting it ( shows very poor quality ) . all-in-all don't waste your money . you get much better camera lower price	1
i really wanted love this camera . camera compact could fit into pocket my jeans ! i plenty research before choosing buy this camera so i expected all quarks unit mentioned other reviews . 30 frames per second uninterlaced video good - course it not good full resolution 60 fields per second video ... but unit fits into my pocket ! huge plus each " shot " individual file dragged off unit onto pc using usb cable . no further processing - file just copies plays quicktime , etc . great feature ability zoom while recording movie , which most point shoot cameras record video not allow you . now sad part ; amazon shipped me two units - both bad pixels lcd ccd . bad pixels lcd , according manual , expected " not malfunction " ; i disagree . cost unit there should no bad pixels lcd monitor . huge problem bad pixels ccd ! this results white pixels recorded files ; this compounded " image stabilization " . image stabilization shifts image ccd receives around attempt stabilize shot video - it works great ! however , video shifted stabilized white pixels shifted around screen well . it almost like there flies moving through every single shot you record . bad ccd reason why i can't love c6 ... i gave up hope sent both back amazon . i'm not sure what i buy now .	1
i bought this camera beginning january . i looking compact camera ( not necessarily pocket size , though ) capable taking great pictures also capable taking movies decent quality . based test reports dpreview other customer reports i decided fuji f31fd . i intrigued new sensor fuji using seems very light sensitive , which true . after receiving camera i took lot test pictures under various conditions , without flash , bright light , low light , different iso settings , different exposure times , etc . i compared pictures my 4-year old sony dsc-v1 results amazing . picture quality fuji very poor . colors ' smeared ' but main problem noise . even under bright light conditions iso 100 settings white considerable noise , same other colors ( rgb noise ) . i didn't check grey/black noise ( they test reports ) but noise white colors just too annoying . what disappointment . lens seemed pretty poor well , least there no comparison sony dsc-v1 carl zeiss lens . after one week we returned camera i bought sony h5 . this really great camera , i must admit . picture quality even better than v1 i thought v1 already pretty good . i only recommend sony h5 , even though it different form factor may therefore not really compare much smaller f31fd . what i liked f31fd its size , its responsiveness monitor menu . however , if picture quality so poor it also doesn't really help	1

quality not real hd looking . footage jumpy . camera terrible low light . even indoors during day , you blast light into camera get readable image . i returned mine i'm looking getting much better sony hd cam which almost double price , but least they smart enough put video light it . professional filmmaker knowing what cameras shoot real hd , i quickly realized i got ripped off . this may good only if you're shooting mostly outdoors during day , but don't expect bring it party , club , or out town night . it seems like they should devoted effort making low light shooting excellent . size camera amazing fact there no tapes great . i really disappointed because i expecting something better . most digital cameras shoot better video , seriously	-1

this awesome little camera . except you can't use it night ! there horrible white spots nighttime photos when flash used . apparently these appear because flash so close lens this camera , so dust reflects badly . it known problem [ ... ] also , it totally annoying sony uses all their proprietary technology . result , cable connecting this camera computer unwieldly ( uhh , you heard usb ??!! ) , you buy sony memory stick , which probably won't work anything else you . flipside , you take movies aren't limited 30 seconds this guy - i think might result memory stick technology . but other than , design operation this little guy seems pretty slick . lens not one those pops out , so not sure if affects image quality all , but far i could tell , quality good . end , what good camera can't take usable pictures its flash ??	-1
this camcorder only good outdoor recording . indoor recording or recording little bit low light , picture quality very bad . i tried record my living room where i two 100 watt bulbs but recorded picture very blurred . outdoor recording sunny day , picture quality quite good sharp colors . zoom works well	1
case looks exactly pictures above , camera fits perfectly it . however , case hardly protection , it not considered more than carrying bag . velcro keeps it closed quite easy open so i've dropped case few times while walking outdoors . fortunately case designed use straps camera carrying it around , so my camera stays me any even t.t here little strap case , supposedly attach case camera or straps , but it opens too easily , so it can't trusted all ( strap almost opens very weight case , which not much ) . there also small pocket back , providing barely room enough set replacement batteries ( 4 aa batteries ) usb cable . again , velcro it too easy open , even more after placing batteries cable inside pocket . definitely , this not designed practical solution . just enough protect camera dust some scratches . if you value your equipment want protect it more than wind sun , while not worried losing case around -or its contents , don't buy this one . spend some more money get decent carrying case . i	1

bought this housing new november 2005 . april i used it first time it flooded first dive ! neither amazon ( since it ouside 30 day return policy ) nor canon stand behind this product ! period ! i got so much run around canon it ridiculous . they wanted " evaluate " housing determine if it defective ... dah ? they would not tell me if i sent it back " evaluation " what final resolution would ( refund , rework etc ) . coincidentally , person same trip same housing ... it flooded their first dive too !!!! coincidence ? no . just terrible quality control no product support canon . not buy canon products !!	-1

this scope not good starter scope anyone interested astronomy . here why : 1 . objective too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it too small bring light necessary even beginning look universe . i suppose it adequate moon , but it . planets appear very small disks . one able see saturn rings , but image very small . forget it deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc . 2 . mount altazimuth , which not follow celestial object sky . earth rotating , anyone focusing star or moon quickly find object drifting out field vision . better mount equatorial mount which makes it much easier track objects . 3 . 4mm eyepiece too powerful this scope . observer find it hard look through ( very small eye opening ) , most cases cause blurred images . 20 mm eyepiece only functional eyepiece . barlow 3x , which again too poweerful this scope . 4 . mount vibrate when touched , which cause image eyepiece " shiver " , which very frustrating . even low price , don't enticed this scope ; it too many flaws . save your money larger scope better mount . jim " konedog " koenig , astronomy buf	1

after reading great reviews regarding vct870rm tripod ( here elsewhere ) , i decided purchase one my sony hdr-hc1 camcorder . when i first opened box , vct870rm seemed sturdy well made . tilting action smooth nice touch , remote controls handle worked well . however , panning action so stiff while attempting pan , main column would twist handle would bend slightly . it felt like tension control knob tightened , but not case . fact , panning continued drag severely even tension knob completely removed . i recently found vct870rm review 5 years ago where somebody else same problem stiff panning . however , due all other great reviews this tripod , i'm assuming i just received bad one . i'm now process working amazon get replacement sent me . so far , amazon great , they've already scheduled ups come my home pick up defective tripod very next day . they say i'll receive my new tripod next week . i'll post here status new one when it arrives . update : i received new replacement vct870rm tripod amazon , this one works great . panning tilting both very smooth , tension adjustable . if i'd received this tripod originally , i would've given it 5 stars . first vct870rm i received definitely defective . i'm glad i returned it , i'm glad i bought it through amazon ( best price time , hassle-free return )	1

if i could , i would give this camcorder 0 5 . since i now search new camcorder , reading other panasonic model reviews , i am convinced i not just get lemon , but panasonic brand bad . we bought this camcorder 18 months ago birth our son . it problems beginning . first , i could not finalize disk . i called panasonic support , who basically told me problems we because camera not held still while recording . this ridiculous since i often set camera down countertop so i video . then i finally got someone tell me i needed recording panasonic mini-dvds . best it worked panasonic dvds which some most expensive , even no guarantee you able watch dvd after finalization . i still freezing picture sparatic playback when trying watch . it skipped over whole sections . i 3 dvd players my home ( all different brands ) disk works none them . i finally got address send it repairs . i not happy without my camcorder extended period time . i told they would look camcorder , see if there problem call me . i waited week after i knew it shop check status . panasonic failed mention i would need pay $207.50 up front them look it , then if any repairs needed , this cost would cover them well . so , i without camcorder 3 weeks while waiting see if it needed fixing , company i sent it not even looked it because i not paid them ! this crazy since i get brand new minidv camcorder $225 . only reason it taken me so long take drastic action because we military living overseas bought it best buy . so you see why i couldn't just take it back store ( or i would long time ago) ! also after spending over $500 this piece junk , i could not afford just replace it . sending it not option when my son newborn , because i didn't want miss any precious memories ( which i ened up missing anyway ! ) . so now holidays upon us , i forced purchase camcorder , since i don't know if they send it back me time christmas . i not pay $207.50 camera hasn't worked well out box . i also pay shipping both ways nothing ! plus thing , still picture bad quality . very grainy you actually see pixels when you print it . we only used function once . i lost so many disks , so many others only play part dvd when i think it i cry . i also wasted so much time trying figure out how fix problem customer support useless . i wish i would never bought this camcorder ! if you buying this camcorder capture memories , buy ! i not buy panasonic products again !	-1

i purchased this camera december 2005 replace my 7 year old sony digital 8 camcorder . unfortunately , everything except size inferior panasonic compared " ancient " sony . color not nearly sharp , low light capabilities laughable battery lasts half long . sound quality adequate if not watching playback camera itself . camera highest volume setting too low use if you want listen while loading video into your computer editing program . panasonic relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other minidv camcorders lack . this allows better light control when shooting auditoriums spotlights . it uses toggle control exposure , while it not easy external thumb wheel sony , it adequate . unfortunately , it functions so poorly low light it wouldn't provide adequate color auditorium . i thought image stabilization would great feature but my video much shakier panasonic than my old sony . maybe it because camera so small it hard keep stable larger sony . video editing pc equally easy sony panasonic but panasonic poor user manual would make it very difficult novice figure out your picture quality much better sony digital 8 . if you don't record minidv format or built 3 megapixel still camera , i'd recommend buying inexpensive sony digital8 third price gs250 . if you minidv camera you won't shooting bright sunlight , try brand . this upper end 3ccd camcorder now home closet shelf where it stay unless i need very small camera chase action cross country race or similar event sunny day . otherwise , i'll use old sony so i share video i shoot without embarrassed picture quality	1

i bought this camera after owning olympus digital camera years . i extremely happy my olympus , but wanted something smaller would fit my purse or diaper bag since i'm expecting . this camera such disappointment . just every single picture i took huge white blobs all over it . ( this only happened when using flash . i must admit camera takes great pictures broad daylight without flash . ) plus , if you used zoom all , pictures came out fuzzy . first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! store i bought camera wouldn't take it back because i waited two days past 14-day return policy . so , i sold camera took $100 loss . i'd much rather lose $[ ... ] than keep this camera	-1
leather case magnetc latch , magnetic force strong enough sd card stick onto it . i not lost any images yet camera not gone haywire , but i decided not chance it . i am surprised canon cautions against placing camera strong magnetic fields their user guide yet produce accesory this feature ! although constructed fine leather , case also very bulky , making tiny slim elph twice thick too big fit into pocket or purse . neck strap ok , it looks metallic but wrapped inside clear plastic tubing , making it look quite cheap stiff , again increasing bulk camera . battery works fine , but two other accessories not worth extra money	-1

e550 good camera this lens good job zooming subject but due way camera lens designed , you must camera zoom fully extended order use this tele lens . so this means if subject moving around lot , such my daughter playing soccer , you miss shots where action moved close you because you can't zoom out . long action remains some distance you than this zoom lens useful . i unfortunately too many ruined shots because action moved too close their heads get cut off , etc . negative viewfinder doesn't show zoomed image , you must use lcd screen frame shot , which difficult bright sunlight	1

this camera decent enough camera , compact , easy use takes good quality video still pictures battery life excellent . battery comes it good couple hours continuous recording tapes only last one hour . i acquired second battery good 240+ minutes so i never worry running out juice . i only two complaints really , one minor one major . minor complaint fiddly little controls touch screen lcd viewfinder . i find i need use my reading glasses see what i'm doing . major complaint transfering video my computer via ilink cable ( not supplied ) . i never persuaded it work . browsing various camera fora web i am finding complaint identical mine this model particular well other sony models . computer recognize camera usb mode ( capturing still pictures memory stick ) but not see it all when plugged via ilink ( firewire/ieee 1394 ) . all indications my firewire port cable perfectly ok . sony tech support , both web chat based phone , no clue because i am out warranty it cost flat $210 send it them take look it . if all you want connect camera your tv playback video you take , it good camera . if video capture editing what you mind , buyer beware . because this , i only give product 2 stars , other wise it would 5 . update : i installed new firewire pci card my computer using new cable tried video capture again . i also tried camera my neighbor mac ( theory if mac won't recognize it you really know you problem ) . computer still won't recognize camera . this camera used very little definitely not abused . it probably defective right out box it appears common problem . if you buy this , make sure you test all its capabilities soon you get it . don't wait like i because i'm out warranty it cost me get problem fixed	1
panasonic very compact , very stylish sexy my wife called it , but photos very disappointing : they way noisy ! even if set lowest asa setting 80asa it just barely acceptable they get progressively worse anything above 100asa . colours good , it take very good videos , but still photos just plain bad when compared other cameras photoshop cs2 . course it easy understand why : native resolution images . if one investigates such things , notice panasonic only 72 dpi , same sony , canon improves this 180 , nikon 300 dpi . it not just megapixels folks , but how those megapixels recorded what resolution . obviously camera 72 dpi more noise than one 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking upgrading newer model , yourself favour . try 4 or 5 cameras same megapixel range good camera store taking photos same subject same light condition . set camera lowest asa highest picture quality jpg format , take photos , pop sd card into computer , compare images photoshop . enlarge full pixel size ( 100%) , look meta data same time you see yourself . what i , since i not very happy images my panasonic produced ! i this camera 11 months 20 days exactly , today i traded it nikon p5000 after evaluating over dozen models including leica d-lux3 10mp camera , driving sales persons crazy all testing spending 4 hours store , but it very educational them too	1
i've just returned this unit . it doesn't play videos advertised . i able get it properly play . avi files 320 240 resolution ... see other review below . but 320x240 gives postage stamp size picture . 640 480 playback full size but jerky broken .... more later . i now 3 different brands 8 " photo frames my possession : phillips , pandigital , this coby . i developed following list features my " ideal " photo frame . first , video playback : i've taking lot video clips my digital still camera ... they come out well convenience not lug my camcorder , ability quickly transfer clip files within/between chips my computer attractive . i would like frame which play format my camera taking ( . mov , more later ) i'd also like frame play multi-media show ... , play movie clips show presentations , intermixed . jpg photo files . second feature play . wma music files , addition mp3 . this because i non-ipod personal music player . all my music . wma format because it roughly half file size mp3 . third , i would like timer my frame ... set it come morning , off night , example . fourth , i'd like audio or speaker out feature . none these frames home theater-like sound , i extra pair computer speakers i'd probably hook up . video out could come handy too . fifth , i'd like able rotate stills within frame software , manually or automatically . yes , you rotate them computer , but frame may or may not preserve rotation . ( this may depend which photo edit program you using . ) sixth , i'd like folder hierarchy file management system frame software . especially huge chips now available , i see advantage push couple buttons change picture set ( folder ) , rather than switching out chips . here where 3 units i've stack up , followed my next ( fourth ) unit . i am keeping pandigital .... which costco $140 . it plays . mov video files , but not within slideshow . it no speaker out jack sound tinny . it requires mp3 music files . it permits picture rotation . no folder management system . no clock/timer . no ability play stills/video intermixed . i think coby phillips picture quality brighter but pandigital ok . phillips didn't play video , since it also software glitch when i returned it i decided look elsewhere . ( no remote no music philips either . ) coby won't play my videos , even after i used my converter program try 10 different mp4 avi variations . coby plays . wma music files , won't rotate stills , no folder system , no clock/timer . it speaker out jack . it not permit intermixing video stills one multimedia show . picture quality fully equal philips , generally recognized standard . if all you want photos , never turn your camera sideways , this unit good value . unit i'd like get play would image moments model digitalfoci . i've exchanged emails someone there who clearly knows what they talking i believe this unit intermix my photos videos .	-1

my 5-year old daughter spent all day taking pictures her her baby sister san francisco . we put new batteries morning . next day i wondering why picture numbers reset . when i tried download pictures my computer , they all gone , battery icon flashing . based what i've read here , it appears batteries died after one day use pictures all erased . picture quality same old camera phone -- pretty poor , but good enough my 5-year enjoy . but what good when there aren't even any pictures next day . i'm hoping store take it back	-1
first , i want defend this camera lack lcd viewscreen -- really unrealistic expect something like this price point . what wrong this camera it tries so many different things it doesn't one thing it needs well -- i.e. , take picture push button . this product would much better if you took out all settings ( what kid needs different resolution settings cheap camera , crying out loud ? ) simply put auto-flash . it , you must consult manual , push mode button until you find correct symbol flash ( which not intuitive , so you'll need carry manual you ) , press shutter button turn flash , wait little red light come , then you take picture . then you shut it off or it goes off itself after very short period inactivity , next time you want take picture you it all over again ! oh , i mention it won't take picture if there isn't enough light ( there wasn't even brightest room my house ) , so you must use flash ? clearly , makers this product not test it real children . heck , my digital camera easier use than this ! we never even got see picture quality -- after trying get it even take picture , i knew this going back store asap	-1

this microphone listed compatible accessory sony hdr-hc7 video camera most websites , including sonystyle . while microphone may good quality ( i didn't opportunity thoroughly test it ) , it only marginally compatible very poor choice hdr-hc7 . microphone plug into mic jack camera appears work , but shoe not fit hot shoe bracket camera . ( note there no direct way tell if it actually working without playing tape back , which point it probably too late make correction . ) after nearly hour very irritating chat room discussion , finally , direct conversation sony technician , i learned there " jury-rigged " bracket allow you attach microphone near camera tripod . otherwise , there no way fix it camera . sony technician finally admitted it " curious " sony lists this compatible microphone . if you sony hdr-hc7 , choose different microphone !	-1

i measured 7 batteries out pack 20 la crosse charger , which i also bought amazon . capacity ranged 547 mah 2002 mah , average 886 mah . that third stated capacity . before i took measurements , i made sure charger works properly testing it two different brands aa nimh batteries : la crosse energizer . both scored very close their stated capacity . therefore , test valid sunpak claim 2650 mah grossly overstated . my advice : avoid sunpak like plague !	-1
i spend hours pouring over reviews trying decide which ultracompact best deal best overall camera . end , it came down panasonic fx01 cannon sd600 . i read warnings other reviewers panasonic images weren't top quality , but i chose ignore those reviewers because paper fx01 looks like it would out perform sd600 . i wrong . after using fx01 few days i knew what those other reviewers talking - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera great , but it just wasn't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera amazon ( very easy-great service ) because poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs why you take photos , right ? i know someone sd600 he very happy quality . judging customer images sd600 page amazon , i think i should've gone cannon	1
i received this christmas present . this digital camera works fine still shots , pictures my family , etc , but action shots , kids playing outside , basketball games , etc . it big disappointment . i took 47 pictures my son playing basketball our school gym only 5 them worth keeping . i've taken several games/activities try it out . i've tried using different functions , adjusting manual setting , playing zoom but nothing worked . many shots blurred , shadows ( because movement ) , or so dark people can't seen . i wish i would known this before i asked this camera .	1
after receiving case trying use it camera , i discovered it very cumbersome almost impossible manipulate . instance , you cannot access cf card or camera attached portion screwed into tripod mount , also , taking front cover off take picture hassle . this not useable carry-around use . i it sitting corner my office unused , spent good money nothing .	-1
bought camera recommendation , also what looked like good specs web . owned it less than two weeks when lcd screen cracked ( below surface protective cover ) . turns out this very common problem these cameras . panasonic not warranty fix this ! if you get one , or own one , very careful not use left nav button . if you , very careful pressure you apply . this camera glass jaw , you might end up " bricking " brand new camera . i am replacing mine canon	-1

if you purchase this wide angle lens adapter xacti hd1a , you not able take still photos using built flash . adapter blocks flash causes black shadows bottom half your photos . it work well video . sanyo xacti hd1a camera itself disappointment	1
we never dropped our camera until now its still looks fresh new . one day , lens just won't open . it lights up then after few seconds , it turns off automatically . called up kodak service center they gave me quote repair . price they've given me close my purchase price here amazon!i'll never buy kodak camera again until they come up good pricing repairs . i believe all electronic gadgets die some point . so i'm expecting believable quote repairs . i think kodak making expensive disposable digital camera	-1

this my second camcorder- after canon lasted 2 years but developed motor noise . this panasonic literally suddenly died after only 3 months ( well , 3 months week- thereby week too late warranty " too bad , so sad " response panasonic ! ) . i used it film wedding- it terrible indoor quality poor sound quality obviously short pathetic lifespan . not buy this camera	-1
i bought this replace my broken digital8 sony camcorder same sales guy who sold me sony 6 years ago advised me buy this jvc , one single criterion : near-infinite hard disk drive storage . this almost only claim actually fulfilled . summary : infinite recording time , disappointing image quality control price , painful editing . not average imovie user . positive points : - storage capacity : dream . i thought 7 hours high-quality video would barely last two weeks vacation . actually it took me months fill them . mostly because , digital cameras , you throw away all bad takes . i decided i'd keep all my previous good takes until i really would need space , well ... i still my best clips 5 months ago camcorder , which means i always show them friends family location , even if i don't my computer or dvd copies me . - size , weight shape : perfect . you take this camcorder anywhere without facing hard packing decisions . it small , feels rather rugged . i added wide-angle lens bigger optional battery , which makes camera 50% bulkier but still manageable . shape great , least my hand size . i really grab camera properly various situations verticality bumpiness ... microphones not well placed though , i often cover them my fingers . - image stabilization : very good . chance i shot clip my wide-angle lens way , which gave me good fixed reference see how beast fast smooth correcting unwanted shakiness . - ease connection : usb2 link ok . i'd preferred firewire , but here we not dealing video streams but video files . btw , this allows faster-than-real-time transfer . firewire link camcorder acting hard disk would great ... ok points : user interface , reaction time ( even if it takes long time get ready ) , optics , battery life ( 3 hour batt . - actually 1.5 hours ) . negative points : - image quality : considering price , image quality disappointing . frankly . viewfinder flattering but color saturation fact low , clips shot sunny days seem sadder than they i found out after shooting whole week yucatan . clips shot my digital camera ( canon ixus 60 ) look better . there also lack control image quality . - digital camera : simply forget it . my phone takes better pictures . i'd advise you buy 2mpix+ cellphone enjoy benefit sending your pics videos immediately far-away family pals . - file transfer editing : pretty horrible originally supplied software . marketing copy , mpeg2 files might seem nice target format , but we always edit our videos , this quite painful , whatever power-users might tell you . you hours conversion , except if you burn your raw takes , risk boring your audience . i going write " don't buy this if you mac user " . this not imovie ready . i both pcs macs , it equally painful disappointing , except if you buy yourself real video editing suite . still , if you mac everio get yourself wonderful mpeg streamclip free utility squared 5 . it allows batch conversion everio . mod files into useable formats . you'll buy mpeg2 component apple first change . mod extensions . mpg prior conversions . time- disk-space-consuming but worth it , image quality superior one generated jvc-supplied software . neat thing : leave your computer homethough you can't use camcorder external hard disk ( it write-protected ) you copy photographs sd card hard-disk , which means everio , you wont need bring your computer trip just store pictures your digital camera . conclusion : given choice , i won't buy this camcorder , mainly below-par image quality , i'm ready cope complications conversion editing . but i'd seriously miss storage capacity	1
i bought this camera 3 months ago used it few times . last week all sudden pictures look out focus over-exposed . i haven't changed anything or anything . i no idea what wrong camera , but given price i'm pretty annoyed amazon.com not refund my money because it over 30 days	-1
i read other review , decided give it try . soon i recieve it mail , opened box , i realized this mistake . cheap quality binocular " high power " selling point . it came already broken two eye ruber pieces falling apart . you see how cheap glue used put it place ! it extremly heavy hold hands more than one minute nature observation . you constantly ajdusting focus . your fingers bumps focus bar while you holding it . indeed strap , case , lense protectors all cheap crap , annoying it all ~ ! i am taking this back , buying made japan " nikon eagle view " 100 times better . you get what you pay ~ !!!!!	-1
first day i took them out hunt them they fogged over . i brought them home there fog inside . also inside some dark crap you cannot get ... it lens . i called bushnell help line they told me ... " well , it isn't internally fog proof , just externally " when asked stuff inside . " probably fungus , sometimes happens " i just bought binoculars !!! he stated i could send them miss my entire hunting season they would take fungus out . avoid these all costs !!! they shoddy product even worse strap plastic cuts into your neck	-1
if you like take pictures macro lense , it sucks . i've many canon cameras this one takes prize worst quality . if you get closer than five inches , pictures messes up . i've no other problem hardware , though i hate carrying around dock it odd shaped charger . no other charger cable world going fit ! so loose it you're screwed . oh , night photos also suck . big time , even flash	-1
this great back pack ! if there anything i would change it would logo front . it brite shinny , i'd rather not advertise i camera there ! i colored it felt pen it works great ....... overall , i love backpack !!	1
i've this lens 2 months now , love it . it my first " " lens i see quality difference this line . first , i tried 28-135 is-pretty good . but i wasn't totally happy , so returned it ordered 24-105 . now i'm happy . contrast , sharpness , ca much better . build quality feel superior well . plus really works . i try get all lens future , i believe it worth extra cost . focusing very quick zoom action smooth steady . if you're budget , 28-135 real nice . but go all way , i recommend this lens . 24-105 quieter i found . price bit steep , but optical quality there , resale value remain good , weather sealing should hopefully keep dust junk getting inside this lens .	1
controls little complicated get used , especially all-manual settings -- which should definition easy use -- but overall this camera very rugged very capable . after i bought it , i took d10 budapest , hungary . i great view danube set my camera up night shots . it brilliant job . how this : take digital night shot ( use largest image size possible ) , use 300mm lense blow results up 24x30 through shutterfly.com . image remained amazingly sharp . colors fantastic . camera made it easy look like pro . only gripe i this camera i wish it black white setting like other less expensive canon digitals , but this overcome software so it not huge issue . price great , it magnesium body ( vs . rebel plastic body ) . you get lot d1/d20/d30 , without cost	1
i'm sure there those who'd wax philosophical over subject filters how one brand " much better " than , but my canon ef-s 10-22mm 20d , i figure canon would fairly good making filter they're willing branded " canon . " it fits fine , doesn't interfere lens hood , looks clear , seems attenuate nasty ultra-violet part light spectrum perhaps best all , protects front element . what more would one want	1
i didn't ton time research this flash . i've used it now several occasions my canon 5d couldn't happier it . it great shooting portraits . i shoot 10 shots row flash keeps up . i would definitely purchase plastic diffuser - get rid typical flash harsh light	1
wow !!! this my 4th sony , i keep trading up i am so impressed . there no delay shutter speed , great pictures enough special effects fun , but not enough you need phd operate	1
good remote . finnicky times if not lined up correctly camera	1
don't listen reviews claim this lens not good choice cropped sensor cameras ( ie 20d , 30d , rebels etc ) canon lens best this particular lens no exception . i lens less than 24 hours now am love sharpness color already . great lens , great color , so well built , super sharp , just watch out if this your first lens , you'll hooked . this lens you many years , great investment	1
nick xu , if you can't figure out difference this lens , cheaper consumer grade lenses , all means , stay cheaper consumer grade lenses . after all , " mr magoo " cartoon fame couldn't tell chevy rolls royce . all kidding aside , this lens simply awesome use . one these lenses camera bag very close practice owning three or four high end prime lenses . yes , it good . i am using borrowed version right now , but soon i pay off my new 24-105 f/4 usm lens ( very , very awesome ) , i buy my own 70-200 f/ 2.8 usm . it good it gets this lens range , but if you feel comfortable pinhole camera , carry , it all end user . everyone else , this lens holy grail mid range telephoto lenses . it simply best available it range , responds well canon tele adapters . if you figure out way afford this lens , buy it , it all . if you nikon lover buy this lens anyway , buy fairly cheap 20d body make it work . it ok tell your friends you used nikon take pics , but you end up knowing canon premeir lens crafter 21'st century . ( sorry , nikon fans , but this lens stands all it self grand scheme things . it simply awesome . )	1
money , you absolutely can't beat this lens . it very fast sharp . not fast focus , but what you expect $70 ? i four lenses , some costing 4x much this one ... yet i use this one most . anyone looking step up kit lens , or anyone looking buy camera body w/out kits lens should look buy this lens	1
i my canon eos 30d week after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted photography . i bought 17-85mm canon lens it takes phenomenal pics especially using software post-processing raw . i also 70-300mm lens sports/outdoors/nature bursts 5fps beautiful sound . i bought camera through dell rebates currently this best deal out there ! strongly recommend . pay extra $$$ get this over rebel xti . you won't disappointed	1
i not trust any batteries except canon my canon cameras . i found " compatible " batteries not always charge incanon charger , not last long camera	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet .	1
just returned trip hawaii opportunity put this lens test . i very pleased results . this powerful lens , yet it relatively light weight not burdensome use . i able get some really amazing wild life shots birds , zooming distance hand held camera ( canon eos 20d ) virtually every shot keeper . feature allows you quickly zoom compose your shot fire it off image quality excellent sharp focus . usually lens this size this much power requires firm grip almost always tripod - not so this one . i shot both portrait landscape mode i didn't see any problems focus , clarity or sharpness . all images clean razor sharp . if you looking long lens ability bring distant shot without use tripods other equipment , i highly recommend this lens your arsenal .	1
i able use canon ef 1.4 ii extender some nature photography recently wyoming . i shot elk low light conditions so i shooting pretty much wide open . extender not compromise inherent sharpness lens all . you could see hairs animals heads . it fantastic	1
i'd stating obvious preaching choir if i said care lenses slr cameras required decent lens cap . this one snaps into 58mm threads end many lenses ( canon otherwise ) , so just sure confirm it proper size your lens	1
i purchased this camera online one month ago amazon here [ ... ] i taken pictures alaska florida washington i love how mark ii captures images imho more clearly than any film slr could ever take . best camera i every use	1
if you've found these reviews , you already know this lens one best canon products out there . i not bite version , i not found myself ever wishing i ; this lens everything it hyped up performs well low-light/indoor situations . i don't think it weight big deal . i really don't any problem carrying this lens around day -- my hands or bag -- even 1.4 extender attached . it feel bit heavy but i don't mind , neither you when you see results later . i've used this lot shooting professional baseball it landed me front page ink several times . my mind , i could get 1.4 extender this lens give myself 70-280 range , which pretty adequate most sports nature photography , considering 300 f/ 2.8 it friends much , much more expensive . lens works basically just fast sharp , my opinion , 1.4 f/4 , although some may debate this . flip any baseball or football game you see this lens around neck most every pro . if you swing price , enjoy it ! my advice continue reading up this or similar products , although i found most everyone agreed , this one finest lens around . it one makes people stop stare wonder who you	1
i purchased canon off camera shoe cord use canon ex 580 weddings . i needed cord use flash braket avoid red eye . it what it supposed . no complaints .	1
i waiting 3 years any manufacturer market camera similar specification canon eos1 . exploration health , safety environment advisor , work takes me middle desert or oceans . wait 35mm film quality , speed picture taking ( 5 frames per second barely enough capture dolphins - hence 8 + fps eos 1 desired ) . there parallel wait image stabilised 28-300 zoom lens . let cut story short . if i want camera bring holiday , it would not this one - battery charger too heavy bulky ; instead i would choose eos20d without hesitation . but hundreds failed 35mm film frames i decided not wait any longer but buy eos1d mark ii because 1ds mark ii not fast enough 4 frames second . 35mm cameras , after few seconds shooting , i would run back inside cabin ( ship ) change film . if there large enough memory card eos1dii , there no need . this camera built seals against environment ( so 28-300mm lens ) . instead scared running out film , now it easy keep shutter button pressed while panning ( hoping ) dolphins their jumps into air . 28-300mm lens attached , there no need change lenses either . dolphins riding bow wave ship could captured 28mm while those further away could caught 300mm setting . it disappointment battery not lion but older nimh . but any photo gear requiring battery it wise spare , whatever substance . i just wish canon package small travel size charger instead standard one which very bulky . it connections two batteries ( yet it could only charge one following other ) but most people would happy using one battery while other one charged . you just try convince some airport officials let you plane above kit , binoculars , laptop , mobile phone , gps ....... ext . hard disk .... hand luggage . work , i am committed therefore bear weight troubles hauling hardware . but holidays , i would choose eos20d built-in flash because who would want lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun possibly tripod ? camera gets 4.5 stars but battery charger lets it down . why just 4.5 stars ? one beauties i thought digital slr not anything processing , just transfer images computer . wrong . . jpg straight out camera not sharp enough . post processing required . why ? why necessary when canon s60 ( which i use different assignments ( underwater housing )) doesn't need ? defeats point . jpg file 5.5 meg when 1.5 meg s60 looks sharper straight out camera ? still , there raw if standard output not suficient . incidentally , eos1dsii also produces 5.5 meg . jpg those also require post processing . those us who not interested working longer than necessary ( me ) 16.7 million pixels would seem bit wasted . i am still waiting camera which produces sharp . jpg files in-camera without post process , shoot 8+ fps sensor size equivalent 35mm film . meantime i shall learn shoot raw files post process . also incidentally , sensor size eos20d smaller , which means although itself lighter than eos1d series camera , carry around extrawide lens not my idea fun holiday . magnification ratio eos1dii 1.3 whereas eos20d 1.6 . this means i could still travel reasonably light ( compromise ) 1dii 28-135mm lens attached . sure it possible use stitching but more time spent computer time precious . any regrets ? none what-so-ever . it state technology moment . benefit using digital , it doesn't matter if you shooting iso 100 all day . come night if you want shoot rig moon backdrop , just change iso 1600 without bother " pushing2 film developing . it beauty when lens attached . you'd need when there machinery vibrations ship moving swell ! good job canon . now you need shoe horn more capable cpu ( process images in-camera ) , fit 1dsii sensor into this one or this motordrive into 1dsii you may persuade me part more cash .	1
this wonderful lens great image quality , very fast , very good build quality . no complaints	1
many great things already said this lens , i support them ! my copy delivers outstanding sharpness ( nearly par my 24-70l ) even * wide open * ( rare wide angle all but finest german manufacturers ) , great color , very little distortion ( many objective tests revealed it probably " best breed " ultra wide angle ) , impressive contrast . surprisingly , build quality not bad : tight fitting mount , damped rings , no jiggles or rattles . if i forced offer ( slight ) negative , it would bokeh lens somewhat " marbly " ... however , when shooting subject oof area differential high enough make bokeh component frame , then subject likely going demand far more attention than bokeh ! ;) fine lens , canon : definitely worth premium over sigma tokina rivals ( both which i sampled before purchasing this optic )	1
this original equipment battery charger manufactered canon . performance charger excellent most canon products . price paid comparible non-sale priced items puchased via internet sites . item recieved original packaging , 3 days after placing order , new ( not reconditioned new appearance ) . i am extremely pleased entire purchase process experienced , information given site ease ordering fast shipping	1
this great camera takes place earlier canon digital elph i lost several years ago . 7.1 megapixels ensures great quality 3x zoom provides crisp clear pictures . fact digital zoom also works great - just make sure camera steady ( i purchased nice compact monopod results awesome ) . although image stabilization feature newer models would great , you can't beat price overall quality this camera pictures it takes . canon sd500 great little camera	1
power-2000 xp-333 charges batteries pairs , one led per pair , not described . xp-555 charges each battery independently slightly faster ( 3 vs 4 hours ) . xp-333 charger very lightweight , xp-555 slightly heavier . they work 110 or 220 includes plug adaptors round european type plugs . i used xp-333 usa overseas . power-2000 makes several other charger models well . xp-333 555 aas 2500 mah , there xp-33327 xp-55527 versions now available 2700 mah batteries . aaa batteries charge faster they hold less charge . aaas power-2000 currently come 850 1000 mah capacities . i believe these capacities aa aaa power-2000 other nimh makers twice great or maybe more than alkalines . i recall , some years ago duracell copper top aas 1100 mah . i not found recent figures web , but got old figure calling 800 number duracell packages . duracell ultras appear bit higher mah figure , but i not know . 1.2 nimh vs 1.5 alkalines seems make no practical difference i am told , i believe it correct , alkaline voltage drops rapidly under 1.5 after initial use while i understand nimh holds its 1.2 value some time .	1
i'm new digital slr world . i using built flash my rebel xt . built-in flash alright , but nothing write home . since i spent most my money camera , i needed flash both affordable would get job . this flash met both requirements . if you advance user , you want higher end flash because flash limited adjuastable features . yet , if you newbie like me , this flash great ! it improved my picture quality dramaticly .	1
i bought this camera owning 2 more digital cameras . one kodak canon ( a70 ) . amazing product ... pro ... almost everything .. cons ... no audio videoi definetly recommend product price	1
it extremely easy use . hard figure out menu , but once there no problem . takes beautiful pictures . great action shots well . seldom find blurry photo it stabelizer built	1
i owned this camera two months now taken 100 photographs ( keepers ) date . because i involved photography almost 35 years , i developed certain prejudices . particular , i never comfortable auto exposure even less comfortable auto focus . fact , last auto focus camera i owned nikon n8008s i ultimately sold auction because i could not adapt using various auto settings . however , i like this camera . why ? d70s very easy camera use i only refer manual check couple settings look up some features . honestly , set up takes only few minutes handling not terribly different film camera . i should point out this camera really designed auto focus lenses if you choose use your manual focus lot , you disable many camera features . because i am both stubborn cheap ( but mostly only when it comes spending money myself ) i am using my manual focus lenses this camera . it true i not get any internal exposure meter readings must rely handheld gossen or sunny 16 rule ( quite effective , really ) exposure determination . lcd preview screen thus critical determining or adjusting exposure . i should also point out depth field preview feature also lost when using manual focus lenses . i stunned when i could not stop my lens down burrowed through manual find out what i doing wrong -- which nothing except i using wrong type lens . while i really miss this feature , i am not sure how big loss it really because viewfinder . others made mention low magnification tunnel like views through finder i attest this fact . i compared finder views my trusty old fm just stunned how poorly d70 compared . ultimately best camera camera you use d70 become my camera choice . even though i am using this camera like vintage series leica -- i.e. , handheld meter presetting exposure anticipation photograph -- i find i live this level usability . some point i probably buy auto focus lens ( maybe 35 f2 ) make full use feature set . but now i content using camera old fashioned way	1
there no professionals or would-be professional photographers our house . instead we ametuers who love get fun shots our friends family . we're not particularly interested birds , flowers , bugs , race cars , etc . we want catch our kids doing what they love best ; football , basketball , swimming , band , golf ... my only advantage i am very experienced adobe photoshop , which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots . this year our son high-school senior . instead buying expensive portrait package , we voted spend money canon digital rebel xt kit ( lens ) . we choose one extra zoom lense ( 75-300mm f4- 5.6 iii usm telephoto ) up-close action sports shots . we didn't chose lens because it out our price range . we great fun this camera lens . we already taken variety football game pictures using ' basic ' sports setting camera ( burst mode full zoom ) . they great - crisp clear . these taken full sun . we realize we'll get little more creative when we taking pictures lower light situations . but i think we it . i would recommend this lens anyone who just wants capture some fun shots . they might not professional quality , but they just what we wanted	1

i able scout out different case options my sony dsc-n1 . after much review , i asked my wife her opinion she picked lcs-nb . it holds camera nice snug but you could work memory stick or battery . so far , so good	1
i this bag year recommend it . i use it all time . it great walkaround bag . first time you're place where you want get your camera quickly or don't want put your bag down you'll appreciate sling design . just aware long mountain hike you may feel weight your shoulder after some time . my only error getting 100 - i should gone 200 , plan so . i like keep my lens hood place which requires little more room . i'd also found i need little more room non-camera things . word all-weather cover - great feature . few weeks ago i bermuda walked beach 25 minutes away . just i arrived soaking rain began didn't let up entire walk back . if i hadn't able pull cover my equipment would soaked . now i wouldn't buy bag without one	1
i use it my nikon d70 , am very satisfied it . i most often use it long exposures , taking picture include myself , taking pictures my 6-month old daughter , who stops acting naturally when she notices i hold camera , so i place it tripod , take pictures her .	1
after way too much time infront pc reading reviews or camera store counter ( damn i sick it ) , this d80 what i chose . bought it 2 weeks ago then went 10 day trip west . after draging it everywhere i not let me down . price its perfect . i'm still working out exactly how make it work its potential aswell fighting understanding other manufacturers camera layouts my head ) work i rebel xt i bought last year i need its compact casing . my brother canon d30 after he progressed xt friend west coast d200 . experience both i still love what i chose . my biggest reason however going again nikon i already n6006 film camera lens my hope i could use its nikkor af 35-105mm this camera give myself more options . after reading lots reviews whether this possible finally taking lens shop i found it worked fine . experience field last 10 days shown it not work seemlessly buy may well me not lens . 2.5 inch lcd sooo much easier read than rebel xt . info read out top much better placed than one above lcd xt ( if obstructed architectural model shoot i can't see through viewfinder myself , i certainly can't see info screen if its below it ) . i didn't go 18-135 end lens there vinyetting issue high end which bothered me . i got great deal same price cameraland new hampshire d80 ( d70s ) 18-70mm tried trusted lens . fab . now need save up wait release 80-300 vr lens thats coming out . would love 80-400 vr but its 3 times price . my hardest time finiding someone it stock , price i wanted pay , set up i wanted who wasn't trying make dodgie deal ( like some those cheap web based places nyc ) . it really hardest part purchase end . i surprised . many people almost reluctant make sale . it wierd . parts hard get too apparently like spare battery very few places 18-135 lens instock either . anyway enjoy your purchase if you choose this camera . i hope it takes many great pictures you .	1
this one best bargains i've seen , " essentially " you get 3 filters price one . image quality these filters great , 812 ( warming ) filter far favorite giving back color richness flash photography so often washes out , unless you patience constantly tweaking your flash power . aside 812 uv protector basically clear protective filter . while it obviously advantages over clear glass , i tend not think it any different . this too great filter which i use half time because it doesn't affect color hues or change stop values too greatly while it takes worry out carrying camera around ready any candid shots may occur . finally included circular polarizer . this filter adjusts amount uv light entering camera spinning filter direction uv rays entering ( or turning thingy till things look better ) . this lens great sunny days take surface glare off lakes glass making them transparent again . it also makes colors more crisp general when photographing buildings other large " reflective " man-made things . so things sound great so far , but now why i only give this item 4 stars . while tiffen known one best photo video filters , they quality control issues no live up thier reputation . my case 812 filter arrived discoloration glass . while it didn't hurt image quality , flaw towards edge filter , i none less didn't want find situation which flaw would diminish quality . seeing it not amazon fault my first e-mail went tiffen replacement which they said they would gladly , but only after i send them filter they recieve it would they ship my replacement ( not option my circumstances ) . instead amazon wonderful customer service shown through again , within 3 days they replaced entire set . second set arrivided without flaw but since my other two filters perfect condition i traded just 812 . i havn't any other issues i'm very satisfied my filters . only other word warning would circular polorizer . while i recieved 2 flawless occassionally i read reviews customers received ones assembled backwards making lens useless . quick way check see if your cp working correctly hold it , thread facing yourself , look lcd monitor or tv spin it until picture dissapears(obviously working correctly ) . i still wouldn't pass up this deal knowing what i now , chances everything show up perfectly but none less if you're concerned order it before you need it check everything over carefully . amazon always best returns often ship replacement next day overnight shipping	1
i searched researched lens purchase my canon rebel xti weeks because i knew i not want kit lens . i also not money spend 5 , 6 , or $700 dollar lens . end after reading countless reviews , ones implementing professional techniques ones using just opinion , this lens looked best value . money i really don't think you beat this lens . it focuses quickly , it really quiet while doing it , it sharp enough money . plus it full time manual focus , which really big plus lens this price range . only problem it little narrow side 1.6 crop factor rebel xti , but i would much rather deal than sub-par image . summary i would recommend this lens place kit lens anyone who doesn't money buy " " series lens . it really great value	1
this one fantastic flash . i it my canon a2e four years , ambivilent , but if you match this lens one canon newer bodies funcionality access all 550ex features , you awesome , powerful , flexable flash change way you shoot	1
this isn't full review but some thoughts i've after using it long time . stabilization- fact if this camera you take everywhere you , you going either lose shots or use flash . if flash doesn't bother you , no sweat . but i've never like look it . ease-of-use- great . voice memo- i use this feature all time . it would nice if it pause button because without it i end up many small files . ex- this where you set exposure . casio great job putting everything one place . only thing they should better if you changed selection ( e.g. iso 200 400 ) hit shutter release it should take shot . instead nothing happens . you click set first . it extra step you make during critical time	1
its time price ( time ) , fantastic camera . 6.3 mp more than sufficient most amateur semi-pro ( non-studio ) work , this camera works very well what really matters : canon fantastic lenses . battery life this camera very good . " shutter lag " ( when you depress button when camera actually takes photo ) fairly well non-existent , only real lag i when i am shooting multiple photos raw format . most photographers know , lens almost more important than body , outside leica lenses , i don't think anything really competes canon line . 18-55 lens comes this camera sufficient casual work ... i used it beach , hikes my dog , when i don't want lug around my bigger , more expensive , higher-quality lenses . but $75 or so , you 50mm 1.8 eos lens , which supplement 18-55 nicely , particularly night photography . my one complaint this camera its ability meter light adequately dark settings . when i shoot raw this isn't such big problem , because i fix it photoshop , but most everything i shoot inside , unless i manually mess white balance every time , orange tint interesting first 200 shots , then annoying after . i think more advanced eos models come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem , also help bit lag raw shots ... but money , this camera excellent , far , far superior , example , olympus ' digital exquivalent ( similar price ) . difference , far i'm concerned , absolute advantage canon lens quality . you use high-end consumer body like this one , use professional piece canon glass ( lens ) take excellent photos . i wouldn't invest system doesn't also boast excellent lens quality	1
this camera amazing . out 3 digital camera under $150 i've used , this far best , beating out kodak sipix . i originally bought sipix , it junk . don't buy sipix that under $150 . kodak some reason didn't seem like it took good pictures finepix , but software little better , kodak . this camera take pictures resolution up 2 megapixels , but i don't even use option because 1 megapixel pictures so amazing . it comes 16mb removable memory card , so you take around 49 pics 1mp , around 24 2mp , it takes short videos 30 seconds mpeg format 320 160 resolution , or more lower setting . lcd screen easily turned or off save battery power , 2 aa batteries it takes lasts pretty long . it nice , sleak design , software no issues windows xp least . only cons i could think only zoom it 2x digital zoom , which pretty much useless , i never use it , since it same thing zooming your picture viewer your computer . so you consider it not any zoom . software it works well , but it could better , options wise . filenames pictures default number depending its order memory card , so if you transfer pics your computer more than once day ( since it creates folders based date ) , you'll rename each pic . but i hardly complain , since pictures come out so incredibly well . i'm so happy this camera ! if you want camera under $150 , this one get . don't even waste your time kodak , unless you want one 3x optical zoom , but that $200 . i use it general purpose , taking pictures freinds such . once while i take picture sunset 2mp , photo quality printed full page . 1mp creates crisp clear desktop wallpaper size images , . 3mp created good smaller images put websites . there no reason buy anything else , go fuji finepix a200 !	1
i highly recommend raynox dcr 1540pro teleconverter canon s2 instead canon branded one . hoya makes 67mm uv filter this both available lensmate.com . canon wc-dc58a wide angle converter however really good . tiffen made better one but it seems not available anymore . way , function s2 provides settings using lens adaptors teleconvertors adjust autofocus function camera necessary unless you wish try focus yourself using manual focus which , my mind , because lcd both screen well viewfinder lower resolution than optical viewfinder , iffy best . trust camera ..... it really excellent job . one final note , i would recommend using focus bracketing option lower light situations auto focus weak those situations .	1
this tripod total shock ! i amazed quality , stability portability . heavy duty denier carrying case great bonus . level quick release also welcome surprise . this best $9.00 i ever spent photography accessories .	1
great flash , all good qualities sb800 but less data dump decision quagmire ! it built flash disperser , its lighter than 800 , so unless you're into more info than you need , go sb600 . oh , it shorter recycle time too .	1
this lens ok magnifying 2x max . full zoom , magnification not sharp without close-up lens	1
well , besides whole bucket full money , one them lets you take photos lower light , okay , that obvious . 16-35mm bit heavier , but not so you'd notice , unless maybe you carrying it around all day , without eating you're bit over hill . so why pay extra money , unless , course , you lot shooting early morning late evening ? maybe you shouldn't , because i've doing lot photo taking both , film digital , one would expect " " lenses , photos crisp sharp . fact i keep i 17-40 camera i carry around all day , you know , one i might leave table restaurant when i got restroom . it lot less money lose someone looking five finger discount . however , my gal pal sara i take lot early morning photos . she shoots old houses , she never , ever goes out without 16-35mm . she swears it , loves it , sometimes i think better than me . so there difference , i'm kind person could happily live less expensive lense , sara not . however they both deliver gorgeous photos . you can't go wrong if lense red circle around it . jack priest , sailor home se	1
this first slr camera i ever owned . i bought it because i going trip around world , wanted nice camera , it recommended camera shop owner . it extremely easy use , so easy i could hand camera someone one countries i visited , point button they needed push i ended up great picture . i didn't need explain thing . i also didn't mind carrying it around all day , it very light its size . i owned camera four years now it still takes beautiful pictures . i taken all sorts pictures this camera , landscapes action shots they all turn out great . action shots never blurry ! only complaint i autofocus not work well low lighting , sometimes it slow sometimes it won't work all . these cases i just turn manual focus option . all options camera great , but honest i rarely use them . i've found it often easier use manual focus than adjust camera so it autofocus off center . if i know i'm going taking action shots or landscapes i set camera mode , but often i forget my pictures still look great . i think this excellent camera , especially someone used point shoot but wants extra quality slr camera give them . there also many choices when it comes additional lenses , so when photography bug gets you , this camera stay you	1
fisheye lens lot fun , i enjoy using mine . however , i find practicality lens minimal . i don't usually want my " serious " photographs fisheye distortion . i don't tend like 1.6 crop canon lower-end digital slr cameras , but fisheye this interesting benefit : it reasonably easy use fisheye standard wide-angle lens , since most distortion removed 1.6 crop . you still get distortion , but it lot easier compose shot without it using 1.6 camera than full-frame camera . either way , lots fun . buy one enjoyment , or even professional assignments if your work calls it , but think if you really want distortion before getting one these	1
fits my canon sd550 perfectly no complains abt . quality product pretty good . when used belt clip , its easy open easy put camera back . camera seems very secured when used belt clip .	1
if you looking great all around camera , this it ! our kids play sports constant motion sports mode captures it all . also love " last 4 " feature , gets some great action shots . we fuji 7000 before this they definately fixed features bugged me . love new manual zoom ( if you like 35mm lenses your like this ) well battery drain . i used replace batteries every day , now its more like once week amount we use it . my other favorite feature dual memory slots those times where i forget put it back camera after downloading ! so there always one there !. video comes out great new manual lens you zoom during video shots . general , without spending lot more , you get great camera keeps up active " picture happy " family	1
it seems surprising canon would make product out anything but best materials . lensmate makes superior product out aluminum black silver	1
i bought this camera my sister , early christmas present , thinking i would need some time set it up her , well less then 30 minutes i ready , it awesome camera , i impressed , ease set up formatting 512 sd card . i sent site sister whom interested . it easiest camera use features impress anyone , great photos very close far away . i would recommend this camera anyone	1
item exactly expected . packaging shipment , other item i ordered , unacceptable . child could better	1
this kit must any compatible canon cameras . digital camera rule #1 : always carry spare battery - kit almost worth it alone . leather case great : stylish looks provides tough protective armor case you drop camera . neck strap quite strong looks good too . it may not everyone cup tea but i like it . it comes handy when i need quick access camera don't want fumble through pockets or bags	1
now i this my camera while now , my camera feels so weird it off , i love grip it gives extra battery life great those all day shooting events i go . i wish buttons same plastic/chrome color ones camera but its well built product works fine so i cant complain	1
i upgraded canon digital rebel ( grey body ) this because i ready take my photography new level . one thing i like most this camera it flash compenstation . i purchased 430ex flash it because i tired use built flash always getting those hard shadows wall	1
it working well , it sturdy . i dropped ground when playing frisby , but nothing happened	1
this bag great your slr digtial camera . it space your extra lens . everything came you slr camera fits this bag . this bag great buy its not expensive	1
i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camera , its beyond description ...	1
this great camera . plenty resolution . excellent shot speed . sturdy frame . kit lense doesn't camera justice . buy body separate add better lense . bad side , i small glitch camera firmware soon after purchase return it fix . it two months before camera returned . sorry , canon ... you lose star	1
i bought this flash use my canon rebel xt . first thing i noticed without even reading instructions i able get much better results pictures taken indoors . able bounce flash off white ceilings provided much better color contrasts built flash . even when i set my camera shoot quick pictures succession flash not let me down . it not need anytime recharge all . i recently just came back vacation took lot outdoor evening shots . most pictures came back great results . only dissappointment i when taking shots further distance than i normally would , pictures came back darker than i would've liked . so , compensate this i adjusted flash exposure my camera although it improvement it hassle taking several test shots before getting it right . problem i flash battery cover . it flimsy i find it awkward open close times . i always feel like i'm gonna snap it off accident . overall i am happy . it good flash price you pay . battery life good . i still haven't even recharge batteries i've almost taken 200 shots it . my low light picture improved dramatically investing external flash . anyone decent camera should never use built flash . difference night day	1
70-200 f/4 loved it pieces d60 , now 1d mkii , but sold 4.0 order pay 35-350 , which my work horse . due push pull feature however , 35-350 gets dusty quick good ol ' montana land , so it go cleanings every once while , f/stop isn't always desirable certain situations . 70-200 f/ 2.8 amazing . twist zoom little close camera , so it takes some twisting wrist get it where you need it , imho , bit too much turn 70 200 time one might need extreme sports . ( rodeo , nascar etc ) clarity this piece glass just blew me away . i comparison images my 70-200 f/4 when it new , 2.8 still visibly sharper . i put expensive filter it , my equipment asked lot very harmful conditions , i notice slightest big distortion filter , even though it good bw ..... so when i , i shoot lens no filter if i require extreme detail . 35-350l nowhere near quality this little 2.8 ... if it weren't difference distance , this lens would my one only . oh , i love . it my first lens , i treasure , but know i not buy distance lens without it	1
i purchased this tripod 47th street photo through amazon.com . tripod appeared arrive good shape , except operating instructions not included . i immediately emailed 47th stree photo customer service address printed flyer they included my shipment . i asked them if they would able send me copy operating instructions . they not respond my email , so few days later i emailed them again . once again , no response . i then emailed amazon.com, informed them missing instructions non-responses 47th street photo . no response amazon either ! far tripod goes , it appears very good value money . i gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because , due missing operating instructions , i cannot certain i properly checked out all its features . however , i am certain both 47th street photo amazon.com rate zero stars customer service . i use neither one again	1
this replacement identical battery pack i lost . works great , long life , no problems	1
excellent choice make great job .	1
this my first time purchase battery grip digital slr camera it good investment . i don't worry running out battery power same time it works vertical grip my camera . it also looks nice my canon 30d camera , coupled " " series zoom lens	1
over years i using quantum turbo later 2x2 units ( no turbo sc yet ) power various canon speed-lights 540ez ex580 . some skepticism i picked this unit trial one wedding assignment . well , although quantum units still place my kit power metz unit , i love convenience cp-e3 . one recommendation . buy couple extra battery inserts , if you lot fast shootings , keep them loaded good quality duracell nimh 	1
this best item i ever bought my camera . i lot walking my camera , thought i would use it walking stick , which i , but best part this monopod what i never thought would happen . my pictures never fuzzy ! i take low light photos they come out clear . i paid very little this item would never caught without it my camera . three levers bottom allow quick expansion all different lengths . carrying case allows this item packed next my camera without it getting scratched	1
new nikon en-el3e battery slight update nikon en-el3 provided earlier dslr models such d70 . it adds contact allows new cameras determine how much charge left battery . battery grey distinguish it black en-el3 . en-el3e backwards compatible en-el3 : you put it your d70 or d50 . reverse not true . number pictures battery gives you depends lot factors , including shooting style , lcd usage , course , camera . ( 2.5 " lcd d200 use up battery much quicker than smaller d70 . ) it sufficient day shooting . unless you using d200 some professional capacity , which case , you'll probably investing least one backup battery	1
case great ! it fits camera perfectly exactly what i expected receive when ordering . price right but shipping little higher than i expected	1
i purchased this lens my canon eos 20d digital camera so far i really like it . it focuses fast produces very sharp , clear images . any longer lens you careful camera shake ; i've few images come out blurry but these usually interior shots . i really like 28-200mm focal length range find lens very versatile framing wide shots buildings or landscapes zoomed shots portraits or close detail shots . lens feels solid appears well constructed , which typical canon products . price range , this excellent lens . you only better spending considerable more money lens	1
digital rebel most amazing camera i've ever owned . my previous camera canon a90 i loved using all features it [ great camera ! ] . i decided recently maybe i should graduate slr because i starting get more creative my photography . i spent great deal time researching cameras finally decided digital rebel . after few months owning it i still am amazed . image quality fantastic , it quick responsive , every day using it i learn little more . it perfect intro slr camera me because everything makes sense it easy learn . i've gotten amazing shots i could never dream getting point shoot . if you finding yourself wanting little more than point shoot , go this camera , you wont sorry .	1
np-bg1 type lith pack good picture life , but i'd carry spare if your going use your cameras movie feature	1
this excellent device . quick respond my d80 . i use it take family pictures include me . i just point press this remote activate d80 timer it works beautifully	1
after using both lenses i think this much better . here my reasons : 1- 2.8 makes autofocus much faster accurate . 2- bokeh much better this one . 3- macro slightly better this one . 4- 105 mm make very little difference image size . 5- not very crucial 24-50 range .	1
i am not much photographer . i found this camera easy use my pix just great . believe me , it camera . stabilizer thing works give clear focus almost every time . i even put pix up computer send them easily . i'm thrilled . you need upgrade 1 mgb . memory card when you buy camera .	1
i bought this filter my 28-135 canon lens so far it worked out great . unlike some other tiffen filters i bought , this one fits just right lens . all sides even it sits flush against lens . i haven't noticed any artifacts pictures i've taken yet , but i haven't really much chance take many pictures lens . night shots i've take so far , i've quite pleased , however	1
i wanted buy compact slim d-camera . those larger zoom quite bulky , you can't carry around all time . i think slim camera better choice . i slip into my pocket while wondering around come across something nice take picture it . you can't it huge camera . after i made up mind slim camera , my choices either casio exilim or sony dscw series . casio exilims very sexy . they lot mode scenes . they also function voice recorder . you take pictures book pages etc . they anti-shake capability which said reduce blurred images . i almost buying casio exilim . diligent person i wanted search more more . i found out so-called anti-shake feature bogus . many people found it useless . good reason choose casio . then i found picture quality exilim not really good . i found some pictures taken exilim . they soft , not crisp colors . search web reviews made photo professionals . casio exilim rated significantly less than sony picture quality . iso 200 noise still detectable most reviews . those same reviewers however found sony dscw doing better job . there no noise iso 400 which means even lower light condition sony better job ( less granularity pictures low light ) . big difference !. one feature sony made it very attractive its strong macro . it 0.74 inch which means you bring your camera 0.74 inch ( 2 mm ) close object ( say bug ) still take brilliant picture it . now comparison exilim sony summarize : casio exilimanti-shake ( it bogus)slim lower macro ( 2.5 inches)lower picture quality ( detectable noise iso 200)a lot scene modesquick shuttersony dscw seriesslim ( fact it slimmer)higher macro ( 0.74 inches)higher picture quality ( no noise iso 400)not lot scene modesquick shutterso ..... i purchased sony dscw 7 mp . i took lots pictures . they all brilliant , detailed crisp , true colors . i tried macro took pictures bugs . you see hairs legs bugs . absolutely no noise whatsoever , no blurry . it marvel technology . i took pictures fireworks july 4th using high iso setting . they came out brialliantly like professional pictures . it also uses different kind battery you can't buy your grocery which leave you vulnerable . so you may wanna buy spare one ( 40 bucks ) . but you always recharge it . it lasts much much longer than aaa or nimh batteries . it perfect choice . i highly recommend it .	1
i own several canon lens my 20d this hands down best . i 28-135 which very good lens regardless some reviews , i got many excellent photos it - this distinctly better all ways . ( course , it costs lot more ) . recently went grandchildred sea world i got 100% good photos , several really outstanding ones . it light , accurate - what more you want ? you replace slew lens this one perhaps selling old ones help pay it . bought it soon it available not regretted it one moment . if you one lens , this one	1
this camera steal . reviews amazon helped me decide this camera sure it worth it .	1
after checking prices all usual pricing bots , i found better price , including free shipping , going directly amazon . this lowest price not appear other searches , so it pays go amazon first . i replaced my canon sd400 casio find controls more logical use . this important if you don't use camera while , because you just pick it up start shooting without hunting manual . also , docking base much more convenient than plugging small cables into camera . you not remove battery casio charge it you canon sd400 . vga movie quality superior casio . still pictures appear equal . amazon delivered ups record time even weekend inbetween . i ordered friday received it following tuesday . go amazon !	1
i 5 digital point shoot cameras all little bigger better than last . this my first slr i am not least disappointed . this camera meets or exceeded everything i expected it . very easy learn , read manual use web site tuturial when battery charged your ready go take pictures . i highly recommend this camera	1
wow all there say no problems it perfect casual picture take	1
i've this camera 1 1/2 years now it tried true companion . i've easily taken over 10,000 shots it produced some really exceptional photographs . features really set this camera apart 12x zoom , image stabilization ( must such large zoom ) , rotating screen ( great if you want take picture yourself :)) . i also love macro mode , i've gotten some great quality close-ups . most situations you just stick it auto mode get great results , but different scene modes fun play well . performs extremely well outdoors -- wildlife , sports , landscape , beach , etc . my only real complaint its performance low-light situations . pictures grainy camera very slow respond , sometimes not responding all . also it eat through batteries fairly quickly -- regular aa batteries lasted me 2.5 hours continuous shooting ( around 200 pictures ) or less if i shooting cold weather . i would definately recommend rechargable batteries . overall i've really enjoyed this camera . i've used abused it apart low-light situations ( which i rarely anyway ) it never let me down . both my grandmother my great aunt bought one within past 6 months they rave it	1
this camera really great . i knew i liked it before , but i immediately began appreciate this camera all more when i ended up rebel xt " loaner " while my 20d repair . not xt bad camera , it just doesn't really compare 20d . 20d nice feel it ; it fairly large , which great since i somewhat large hands . features great too . image quality awesome . i don't really need go into all details , most other reviewers excellent job . let me just say it great camera worth five stars . only complaint i camera it doesn't spot metering . ability your light metering off single point interest would great - they add it 30d .	1
i used this lens over 6 months now over 1k shots through it . it fantastic others note herein . 2.8 through focus range really great . superb . vr function really neat trick . it super fun play . drawbacks size weight . after 1/2 hour shooting , your arms get tired . remember careful hold lens not camera . this lens definately heavy enough bend/warp camera body	1
this gadget must-have gadget lovers ..... picture lovers . it compact , solid fits any small pocket or clutch bag . images crisp if you get it set appropriately . if you love attention get this product if you don't ..... not worry camera gets all it .	1
it gave me option change angle light ... this nice option i am sure	1
this camera simply amazing ! i started out canon g2 , then canon g6 , then canon 20d , now this canon 1d mark ii . i debated researched 3 months 1ds mark ii , 5d , 30d . my decision primarily narrowed down 5d this 1d mark ii . yes , i wish this camera full-frame also shared 12.8 mp like 5d , but you know what ? it practically killed me trying weigh pros cons finally i made my decision go this one i'm 110% glad i . me , this camera definitely one get because 45 point focusing , 8.5 fps , 1d pro body/interface/menu/layout , etc what really makes this camera worth it deciding factor . trust me , if you don't know how seriously fast 8.5 fps really , you need go out your camera store try it out before you decide . because this 8.5 fps alone , i'm actually able capture lot shots i normally get lucky getting my 20d . 5d 3fps , i just said forget it ... no way . i'm not even professional taking pictures living . this just purely fun hobby me stepping up 20d this camera out this world . phenomenal auto focusing , additional metering , it like i'm now playing bentley ( 1d mk2 ) coming mercedes c230 hatchback ( cheapest mercedes people buy just because it mercedes name they don't want spend any more money real mercedes ) . this camera photos truly almost help me take pictures like pro . also , i don't shoot action pictures all time , i love portrait photography , landscapes printing blowing up large sized pictures . but even 1.3 crop factor , there still huge improved difference going 1.6 crop you won't vignetting problems some lenses you'll 5d . this 1d mk2 , you still take wonderful wedding photography , landscapes , etc . much i'd like 12.8 mp like 5d , 8mp really all we need these days unless you're going blow up print photos larger than 8x10 or around there . unless you're printing extremely large posters whatnot , you pretty much everything this camera 5d . resolution mp definitely enough . plus , it also invaluable know you 8.5 fps available ready use if you need you also tone it down use slower fps if you need . extra bonuses this camera which i look secondary positive , weather seals , pro-build high quality construction body , easy use navigate menu system , you see iso information viewfinder well lcd screen all times , dual memory card capability , you shoot 2 memory cards same time one backup or use 2 separate cards independently , built-in battery grip ( you don't shell out extra this ) , longer battery life than other cameras , best customization most options you set your liking , more than 5d or 20d or 30d . i could go but definitely get this camera if you afford it . otherwise , 5d also great choice too if you need save money , all you take landscape pictures all day long , or never use fast action or need capture quick moments , don't want fast most accurate focusing system that great ai servo .	1
up front : if you're considering this lens , stop considering - buy it . i occasion try tamaron zoom this range noticed plastic-y digital qualities some tamaron highlighted-texture areas . none problem this canon beauty . i am using it my normal lens . contrast razor-sharp enough shave . it graphic monochrome colors pure leap off monitor like politician attracted tv camera . it also light weight plenty fast enough practically no spherical abs .... tiny problems include understandable perspective bulging subjects edges . there some blue fringing very high contrast edges . photoshop nails latter dead'er than britney spears ' career . i've need reasonably large blow-ups , most captures cropped , yet still enlarged up prints minimally 13x20 . size not only this lens reproduce subject pores , but you peer down see stuff inside craters .	1
digital rebel most amazing camera i've ever owned . my previous camera canon a90 i loved using all features it [ great camera ! ] . i decided recently maybe i should graduate slr because i starting get more creative my photography . i spent great deal time researching cameras finally decided digital rebel . after few months owning it i still am amazed . image quality fantastic , it quick responsive , every day using it i learn little more . it perfect intro slr camera me because everything makes sense it easy learn . i've gotten amazing shots i could never dream getting point shoot . if you finding yourself wanting little more than point shoot , go this camera , you wont sorry .	1
canon makes great underwater housing reasonable price . i purchased this recent trip grand cayman cozumel . i didn't go scuba diving this trip , but i take camera snorkeling ( diving depths ~ 20ft ) . it worked flawlessly i got some pictures i very happy ! one thing i not anticipate use camera got out water . going ac hot humid outdoors , my eos rebel fogged up ( condensation ) even after 30 minutes i couldn't take good pictures . sd110 uw housing , i just wipped housing glass portal lens tissue after it warmed up couple minutes i able take clear pictures . instructions pretty good , but it took me while figure out how take out o-ring seal cleaning/lubing . once i figured it out , it wasn't so hard . sd110 may getting little old , but it still takes decent pictures even housing i don't so much money tied up system i would devestated if it lost or stolen . i probably upgrade sd550 or sd500 ( they both use same batteries sd110 ) wp-dc80 or wp-dc70 housing some time near future , but i definitely keep sd110 wp-dc10 backups	1
nice quality , but overpriced . nice job protecting front lens , reducing glare some situations	1
i bought one these my canon sd-800 recommend it . many years now , i've carried canon pocket cameras my belt while traveling canon-branded cases simply best this purpose . my only criticism canon cases their lack small pocket media . i hoping tiny size sd cards canon would added such pocket their newer cases , but they haven't . plus side , case retains superior leather construction , uses neat magnetic tie down flap instead velcro or snap , belt loop tight enough hold camera comfortably against your body . package also includes nice looking leather replacement strap your camera . incidentally , sd-800 well matched case , fitting quite securely	1
case pretty much what you see ... i no complaints . =) case protects my camera very well	1
i weddings , portrait , outdoor photography i don't see any reason why i'd ever switch d70 ( other than d80 :) . this camera professional grade consumer price point . don't scared 6.1 mp . i print 20x30 all time w/ out any problems . i'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1
i'm using it few months now ; i haven't found single problem so far . earlier , i using old finepix optic/sensor sensitivity not very good ; poor quality photos taken dark environment . this not problem any more . also , i impressed sharpness photos sport actions taken 10x zoom . general , i pretty enthusiastic all features this camera ; it took me nearly 3 days try everything out :-) . sure , there better cameras market ; however , considering price it just great deal	1
quality definitely great . when attached s3 , it makes your camera look serious taking good shots . if you attaching hood doing flash photography , i suggest you use slave flash eliminate shadow caused hood	1
this fabulous reliable camera . feels solid . fantastic pictures . easy operate . new d40 announced over past few days , but its lack lcd display buttons manage basic camera controls ( reduce weight make it more user friendly ) would still make this my recommended nikon dslr . expect prices fall d40 becomes available	1
i honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars . moment i got it , i delighted quality pictures ( except very dark places - which why review gets minus 1 star ) , its portability . i've dropped it , abused it , took it countless parties , countries it now full scratches bumps ( get camera case ! ) , guess what : it still works perfectly first day i got it . this little piece technology amazing , so if you're looking something affordable great picture quality ( us amateurs , course ) just go it . actually , i even took quite few gorgeous pictures it . i even love it rely it so much i won't change it even now it looks all messed up . don't think twice . just go it	1
all reviews i read , i expected certain pros cons this lens . i not disappointed . pros : very sharp lens very good colorscons : vignetting wide open , little too contrastyfor myself , pros outweighed cons price . it ideal 1.6 multiplier cameras , where it becomes 38mm lens	1
i upgraded canon digital rebel ( grey body ) this because i ready take my photography new level . one thing i like most this camera it flash compenstation . i purchased 430ex flash it because i tired use built flash always getting those hard shadows wall	1
battery great , but amazon offers accessory kit same battery , plus mini-dv tape carrying case same price . case useless zr series , but might come handy some other purpose	1
small compact . let me see everyting i wanted	1
i am really satisfied purchase this camera . good quality workmanship . canon leader photography my book . easy use controls any one	1
i received xacti few weeks ago it performing like i hoped it would . controls very simple intuitive . all required hardware included . not require any additional software run mac or windows . i macbook boot camp running windows xp pro . camera works easily either platform . it recognized drive not require any additional software download images movies onto hardrive . i am using sandisk 2gb sd memory card . big plus not wait while downloading real-time like you would minidv . quality may not same minidv but convenience ease use make up difference . quality much better than digital camera when taking movies people think it just camera it small size . my old camera 2 mega pixel canon powershot a60 . this rated 6 mega pixel . you definitely see difference pictures movies . when filming movies , higher frames per second sample rate makes images smooth , even when taking pictures high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades airplane propellers . this my first camcorder so i can't really compare anything else ( except my old camera ) but ease use make you want use it all time people start tell you put thing away	1
price paid , this great camera . should last me long time . debated buying slr , but this seems all features expensive slr ( actually it slr , just no interchangable lenses ) lot easier use	1
i am busy mom two young children . this camera perfect capturing all their cute faces happy moments . i love fast cycle time . i love i take multiple pictures seconds . would recommend anyone	1
300 plus minutes recording time ( without lcd ) . i still got several hours lcd , backlight . when you out all day , this good long lasting battery . hdr-fx1 i found it preferable smaller lighter battery it helped provide touch extra rear weighting . helped balance when using camcorder hip height me . i can't say i noticed extra weight issue when using shoulder height , though i didn't it my shoulder long periods time	1
i purchased this camera shooting product photos our website . i using nikon coolpix 5mp wanted something relatively low cost higher mp next few years . we plan purchase something totally outlandish few years super-quality printed photos , but now , this camera excellent investment . easy small enough everyone company carry trips abroad , but inexpensive enough not break our hearts if pocket-picked or eaten hyena . i've read some reviews talk blurred photos ... i'm really surprised . i began using ours after i my son , so many photos taken without tripod , one hand holding nursing child other shooting photos ... none images turned out blurry . i taken few photos my son now he six-month-old super action hero look like cotton candy my nikon but turn out crystal clear sony . movie mode real plus . i'm actually this page today because i'm looking buy one these my personal use video recording mind . we digital video camera , but plenty 1g memory cards hand , i'd rather record action this camera -- quality sound worlds better . this lovely little low-cost camera that suitable wide range users . i love it	1
this thing great i just got it trip seattle hawaii . ( i know opposite ) but i afraid when i this default battery came my canon zr 500 . ( which only last 45 min . ) but this one last least 3 hours i love it . best buy my camera so far , completely worth $$$$	1
it easy mount puts out surprising amount ligh	1
i got this camera 2 years ago because my sd 200 broke . it soooo easy use takes great pictures . its also very sleek small	1
camera fits perfectly . case very stylish . best all , its pink	1
i purchased this camera so i could photograph wildlife hikes . i needed something not too heavy , image-stabilized , telephoto power . this camera meets all those requirements . it one problem , however . bright light , viewfinder blanks out , so one cannot clearly see object photographed . i solved problem some extent , pointing camera object , letting autofocus rest . this " fix " resulted many excellent photos . like many other small cameras , results tend contrasty , i modify this tendency photoshop	1
after week testing this camcorder , i found it good enough daily use . hd2 not come sd card , so make sure you buy one before or time you get hd2 . i got 2gb sd a-data 4gb sdhc qpi class6 . both worked fine . 4gb gives me 1:20 standardhd mode , 55mns superhd mode . i didn't notice speed difference class2 class6 sd card using hd2 , i think you should fine 8gb sdhc class2 . my first impression camera how small it , however it may not fit jean pocket . it turns very quick , you start filming within 2secs startup . it lady voice telling mode you using ( ie camera mode ) , not sure if this useful others , but not me . video still pictures great outdoor . video quality impressive during bright sunlight . room lighten 60w equivalent fluo light , video quality grainy/noisy , this confirmed other people well . high sensitivity feature ( boost image quality low light ) helps but not enough . my 7yrs old sony digital8 better job 1lux . i noticed video quality grainy low light , but 7mp still picture quality very good same lighting . compared my new canon sd800 7mp , it obvious canon digital camera wins . video side , i played several configuration , iso setting , white balance , resolution , etc ... it helps , but video still grainy low light . this camcorder not designed low light filming . i ran into issue when transfering video pictures hd2 its cradle pc via usb connection . i got errors transfering files if you use craddle ( this freeze hd2 ) . i am not sure why , i check sanyo this . if you connect hd2 directly pc ( without cradle ) , transfer goes smooth . so there issue cradle usb port . i am also using pinnacle studio 10.5 my video editing . so far , i not able use it control my hd2 . you however copy files sd your pc , use these files pinnacle studio . since i film most time outdoor during daytime , this camera job fine video quality great . i would still give 5 stars even video issues low light .	1
i am not professional photographer . i just happen grandson one . i use fully manual canon tx slr my work . so far i've shot 5 rolls this stuff . every time there something wrong camera/me/lighting . every time i got usable , sometimes , great print . this film huge exposure latitute ( you really screw up still get image ) when i show these prints others , they look me funny say , quot ; this iso 400 ? quot ; it really fine grain . because it iso 400 , you use it almost anything ( i got usable prints after shooting soccer game : my camera set iso 100 there light leaks camera door ) . it great film , although i'm told royal gold it replaces still better . pick up pack this see what you get . you'll amazed	1
very easy install ; great tool easily downloading photos computer removing camera ; would recommend anybody	1
this fabulous gift grandparents if you preload pictures . just aware customer support folks not knowledgeable , probably since product new . don't bypass their software load pix if you're transferring your pc frame - their software reduces memory needed each one . even though software different size frames labelled same , it not compatible you only one version installed your pc time	1
looked number cameras including tz3 , p5000 , few others . nothing compared g7 which one i ended up going ; , 6x lens , incredible quality , etc . if you want best camera out there don't feel like messing dslr , canon g7 league it own ~ benchmark which all other manufacturers strive towards .	1
excellent quality/price/speed delivery ... works expected ... would definately buy again , this vendor , if need ever arose .	1
i've this camera couple weeks now , it my 4th digital camera . i am very happy photos i'm able take , they truly outstanding . i'm still learning all settings but i'm finding everything user-friendly . i like way it feels my hand i'm pleased battery life . i purchased 2gb card replace one came camera it perfect size me . video amazing , i standing upstairs bathroom our 2 story house saw our little one jumping trampoline far end our backyard , so i decided tape it . not only quality good , camera picked up audio , which i never expected ! i like you zoom or out while you're taping , i wasn't able my last camera . i've no problems downloading pics or videos my computer prints i've gotten great well	1
i purchased this camera primarily back-up camera . but i find myself using it more more inplace my main camera . it beautiful piece work	1
i needed new camera replace my very old digital camera , so i ordered this one could not happier it . it all kinds features , including some manual control options like white balance , etc . those people who like mess stuff ( i'm more auto person , myself ) . i used it vacation last month pleasantly surprised quality pictures , after taking only few test shots get familiar camera . camera very easy use gives you basic user manual get you started , also detailed manual help you find out how everything works camera . movie mode works good , too . colors come out bright vivid . lag time pictures minimal , which one main things i hated my old 1.3 mp panasonic palmcam , 7.1 mp makes some excellent detail your pictures . only bad thing camera , my opinion , it doesn't movement stabilizer ( or whatever it called ) , so it prone shaking , especially when you zoom using digital zoom . i like camera small lightweight , but it not one those super thin ones you feel like you could break half . overall , i think this great camera , i don't think you find better camera price	1
outstanding service . product advertised . excellent packing job . arrived record time . would buy again this seller	1
i just got my new photo box today . i so excited i opened it work . then i took picture my wendy salad just see how it looked . quality pictures excellent(macro mode ) . light evenly distributed . caution lights : lights get really hot really fast . untouchable within 2min . after i turn them . i suggest shear sanctity safety , shut off lights object/scene changes . package arrived intact , box beat up little , nothing major . when i opened item , i noticed camera stand pierced nylon bottom . this could've bad/weak stitch , or may happened during shipping , but nothing major wrong , only . besides , i sew it ! overall , this great product , easy setup carry around . i'd definitely buy again	1

engaged 35mm photography 32 years , i approached digital photography great reluctance . i knew there would essential learning phase less than ideal pictures , like my playing brownie few years kid -- this further delayed my plunge . finally , upcoming trip overseas compounded knowledge what airport metal detectors film forced issue . my choice cinched some pictures we acquired friend papal conclave 2006 . we ran them screen saver , i much impressed sharpness , color tonality , depth field -- especially cloudy day pictures crowds public squares . faces far into background discernable . i asked what used it this camera . camera store i heartened see it felt like mini slr hand , nice big viewer uncomplicated , straightforward controls . learning phase backyard around town gave me some doubts . lack no-shake feature model biggest downside ; lot got blurred especially using zoom feature moving subjects . some this you learn shake out using point focus , but you still going lose few precious moments despite your best efforts . nor limited equivalent asa range you going able get sort pics museums or dark old cathedrals you used good slr high speed film -- but remember , this one starter . this thing monster battery eater , too : always carry 2 fully charged replacement sets you . plus side , choice black white chrome mode very nice feature , built-in zoom very decent range performance stationary subjects . speed use may or may not compare well other digitals , i don't know , but its whole world superior my old world . there rather steely patina even best color images , i see now after viewing hundreds , but that decent trade-off general ease use clarity . incidentally , lens this camera gives you lot more than what you would expect 4 megapixel rating . back europe this week , i 2000+ jpegs ( keepers ) all very high quality , achievement i could not come close , i am sure , either old film camera or most other starter level digitals . continuing issue shake blur i surmounted simply multiple shooting lot ( sometimes 5-7 images ); you erase them almost quickly you shoot them , come see this small nuisance bigger trade-off . i not plan spend rest my life this level digital camera , but even after i move up i think i keep it around sheer utilty ease use general every day world . price , this good deal one hope .	1

wow .. okay so i thinking this screen size smaller camera because i didnt read dimensions before i bought it here amazon so i little disappointed size . this half size ipod mini . it no means big . read dimesions well before you purchase . photos really good quality clear .. just small lol .	1
i needed extra battery . this whole kit cheaper than price battery alone . addition battery , you get standard camera case ( retail $10-20 ) very nice shoulder bag intended carry 2 cameras , accessories , portable canon printer . there absolutely nothing not like this deal	1
i enjoyed using my camera . i able get some great pictures . stabilization feature work well	1

we got this camcorder our daughter her birthday she loves it ! her only problem it memory card needed because there isn't much space she would like alot light needed film . we aware both these complaints when we purchased it but we certain she could work around them . we also aware battery problem , so she got rechargeable batteries . awesome little camcorder , especially price	1
i got this bag under $15 it worth every penny . it fits my canon zr850 accessories . it looks nice it seems great quality .	1
this product so cool . whatever your situation , if you lot digital pictures , then i recommend going out getting sd card ... preferably up 1gb ( or even 512mb ) , use this this product . even if your camera doesn't use sd , you plop sd card right into picture frame upload photos your computer card ! it like little computer , this frame . big suggestion i find program online resizes your photos dimensions frame ( photo size explained other reviews ) . ( i downloaded visualizer photo resize ) . this take photos down its original size ( e.g. 1.8 mb ) smaller size ( e.g. 500kb ) . this let your store dramatically more photos . so far i fit over 1700 photos 430mb worth 1gb sd card i ! picture quality very good frame swivel basically any angle could used horizontally or vertically . plus , it philips , which great brand . i philips hd tv well it my baby ... i love it . this great present anyone ! how you go wrong picture frame replaces its picture any time you want	1
i gave this xmas gift my 14-yr-old daughter she loves it . super easy use . good idea get backup battery if you're like her forget charge it sometimes . big selling bonus it thin enough fit into her pocket	1
i olympus stylus 4mp loved it but wanted newer model . i purchased this 710 love it . olympus makes it so easy take pictures pre-set options image stabilization . i love smaller size this camera it easy use . there no way give it 4 1/2 stars so i gave it 5 but there one thing i don't like area usb plug . you pop off this cap ( it hangs off camera ) maneuver small end cable camera ( tight fit cap hanging there ) then pop cap back .. it just seems flimsy i wonder if cap eventually break off . 410 it much easier access this it near memory card . only design feature i don't care 710 . it great camera i am very happy purchase .	1
i purchased this camera case kodak z650 . this case perfect kodak z650 . it looks feels like high quality camera case allow storage sd card or two . i'm very happy this purchase	1
binoculars suprisingly lightweight their size power . 70mm lens great light gathering , 4.75 mm exit pupilprovide more light than most adults use . ( avg . 3-4 mm)with good strap easy wear long periods excellent long distance terrestrial viewing or general astromical use . you really need tripod use full power effectively , but short periods those steady hands enjoy binocs fly	1
i bought this together sony alpha ( very good deal amazon ) . lens great complement kit lens or identical but older km 18-70 . images very sharp lens built very well . great wildlife imaging . other reviewers right ; af isn't too good long end this lens but overall great camera . end lens rotate while zooming . it may not good some filters	1
i've owned t9 now just 3 weeks . i purchased it after some extensive research . course you never really know product until you've it awhile . here my thumb nail opinion . i like : ultra thin metal bodyoptical image stabilizergreat photo qualityhigh iso performancelarge , high rez screenauto focus assist lamp works wellvery fast start-upfast recovery even after flashlots built memory , but you need buy 1 or 2 gig cardok slide show feature musici don't like : redeye doesn't work welltoo few manual controlsneeds white balanceneeds long shutter speed modeschews up battery time pretty fast . already ordered second battery . no optical viewfinder ( most ultra smalls don't)flimsy plastic cover over battery first thing breakall all great little camera . takes awesome , clear pics . not professional photographer , but that not why you considering it ( i hope ) .	1
this only tripod i ever owned , however , i agree it seems very nice piece equipment , especially very low price . it suits my needs well small digital camera . only downside it not come carry bag . this oversight my part when i ordered , i'm sure i would pay just much i tripod get bag it , so i live it	1
great camera , only bad thing batteries die very quicklyit takes great pictures some good features ..	1

i bought this dock seller called miga . they excellent job answering my questions product sending everything mint condition . i use dock my hp r817 . read reviews regarding insert i just went through hp part site ordered correct insert my camera . it only $5 ( before shipping ) it arrived same day dock package . dock transfers data so much faster then cradle comes camera plus it extra battery which would cost $50 up itself hp . i bought dock its dual charging ability when i go trips since this dock less expensive then fast charge travel kit . i probably won't use remote control feature or print images right dock . but what i use it its excellent product price i highly recommend it you 817 818 users out there .	1
i originally bought edit 120 ( no detachable case ) but looking separate bag which keep cables not used often ( leave home ) . then i came across edit 120+ detachable case which fit bill exactly . not haven actually seen detachable bag yet , i somewhat concerned method/design atachment . it needed easy remove , but it also needed secure ; pictures i found internet didn't show how it attached . i relieved when i actually saw how it attached . there slotted bottom main bag entire length bag ( open slot each end ) . add-on bag wide semi-rigid flap slides through slotted bottom fold down tab free end secured velcro . attachment method secure almost invisable , design compliments aesthetics original bag . i think original bag very good , add-on detachable bag makes this superb choice . unfortunately , you buy this combination . if you originally bought 120 single bag version , it doesn't slotted bottom it can't retrofitted ( i don't think they sell detachable bag separately )	1
case protective stylish without hindering camera ability store transport easily . it definately worth dough keep your nikon s1 or s2 scratching or even breaking minor fall	1
i using fuji e550 almnost two years , none problems reported some reviewers . here negatives : 1 ) flash mediocre range little finicky . if you don't depress shooting button all way , it may not flash . 2 ) bright light , screen back unusable - it washes out image . but camera fine viewfinder so this not really major issue . positives : 1 ) it takes great pictures . really excellent . 2 ) it small , easy carry . 3 ) controls well thought out positioned camera body . very easy use . 4 ) it several automatic modes - sports , landscapes , portrait , etc , or you use it manual . i always use one programmed modes . 5 ) video option not bad all - my twelve year old ( now 13 ) uses it . i so pleased this camera i bought one my administrative assistant ten months ago , she very happy it . it current price i think this camera bargain . only reason i didn't give it five stars because weak flash .	1
i amazed how well this battery performed . i make sure when i got it i complete charge complete discharge it not let me down since . i shoot well over two hours without needing change very meek battery came my camcorder ( sony hdr-hc1 ) . it thicker sticks off back little bit more so you not get your eye up eyepiece but i use lcd when shooting anyway , almost always tripod	1
i purchased this kit , primarily extra battery , which retails what i paid this item . backup battery great , but i pleasantly suprised soft case . it protects my dsc-p200 , without bulky or heavy . camera so small , it hard find good protection without spending quite bit money . case memory sticks nice well . it easy lose stick if it just floating around case keeps them securely . all all , this excellent value	1
this good padded case your camera . but back pocket shown picture phone stick out , not deep enough my phone antenna attached . it measure 4 " 3.5 " . but other than i enjoy using this bag	1
when it comes buying camcorders , i personally like one build memory . but after using this camcorder i forced change my mind . unlike other sony camcorders , first all , it offers upto 40x zoom which lot . its good use your money . you it under $400 still works better than lot choices out there . easy use , touch screen , takes still photos , good speaker so it easier record video voice , fits into your palm so speak , if you use rewritable mini dvds , you wouldn't worry go out memory . so when it comes sony camcorders , i would say better quality this one would get job properly .	1
very happy our camera ! perfect condition quick arrival	1
this battery recharger its job well . no bells or whistles , just plug it , put battery , wait red light turn green	1
i wall hung plasma tv speakers my surround system mounted either side . i able locate all receivers room super clean installation . hot pro ir target very sensitive !! initially i hot pro " box " too close tv blue indicator light always . if it glowing , you need move something . once indicator isn't lit but flashes when you use your remote , it works flawlessly	1
i decide this camera panasonic . we trust sony brand little more , so we went sony . we looking easy-to-use camera we could just pick up record our daughter ... nothing professional but good enough quality enjoy years later . i also wanted camera could take still photos so we wouldn't need both digital camera camcorder when we take vacations . here what i think so far : great camcorder exactly what we want -- picture looks great inside out , very easy use , small enough carry almost anywhere . still photos not fantastic ( only 3mp ) , but good enough me . color resolution acceptable . not easy understand lcd touch menus , but you configure buttons once you figure out which buttons you use most . i got bare minimums accessories ... bought 1gb memory card ( memory stick duo pro ) ... glad i this since i taking stills short video clips email grandparents . also got carrying case , dv tapes , extra np-fp71 battery . i'll purchasing firewire cable soon ( i'm sure you've heard , usb cable inadequate downloading video ) . handycam station doesn't really bother me much , but i see what fuss . all things considered , i'm extremely happy my purchase . i think this perfect camera firs t-t ime camcorder buyer who needs easy button ( there one side camera ) . little more expensive than some others , but price dropping . best luck !	1
solidly built , this tripod balances well even when used heavier sony cybershots like dsc-r1 . remote shuttle release button helps further reduce camera shake , which priceless when taking photos conditions where camera shake amplified ( high optical zoom , supressed flash , etc ) . what surprises me fact shuttle release button remote works exactly same any sony cybershot : press halfway focus , all way down capture sho t.t he zooming buttons not work sony dsc-r1 camera manual zooming ring , but they should work fine any other cybershot comes electronic zoom course , acc terminal . highly recommended .	1
there some very detailed reviews , most which i read before i ordered camera amazon . there ample evidence professionals find camera useful . i want take minute speak rest us . camera came month ago i've extremely happy it . let me offer some perspective my comments . last camera i bought small sony shirt-pocket-sized camera i using alot it got me back into taking pictures . i decided since i taking so many pictures i wanted camera would take much better quality shots , without my get phd picture-taking . i opted this camera 18-200mm lens . i now take same pictures i took small camera , but zoom lens i frame them better 10.2 mega pixels i blow them up frame them . there dozens ( hundreds ? ) features i grow into , but now i am delighted use this camera right out box , just minimal reading instructions . everything i remember my 35mm days ( my first camera minolta srt-101 i bought 1973 ) put use , but what i forget , camera remembers . my poin t--t his camera ready meet you wherever you grow you should you decide you want go farther out deeper	1
you won't go wrong panasonic dv . i've few models . i several this model my business . they're rock solid reliable , nice small portability , quality recording very goo	1
it light ; 6x magnification ; easy use . this little tool great any golfer . you must know yardage before you select correct club . how far it either top bunker next green or flagstick ? next , you just then need pull club get you there . fits your belt through loop safe carrying case or use supplied clip attached case your golf bag . these new laser rangefinders better than ever lower price than previous models . love it	1
received camera exactly described . easy smooth transaction would this vendor again . thank	1
this very good camcorder main problem i noted dvd format giving only 30 minutes or so recording hd mode per disk . it also problem only blue-ray dvd players play back dvd hd mode . even worse it might destroy disk if you use it player . nevertheless , price good i think blue-ray more affordable near future . meanwhile , i playback my video directly or send it computer . i am glad i bought it . if minidv tape version available same price now i think it might better stick tape version now though . i sent bad power supply camcorder but sony sent new one right away . careful buy correct battery external charger accessories camera it bit confusing which work it . overall - i am very happy camcorder	1
d300 easy use it takes great video outside , very good low light . it also takes very good pictures , battery last long time . i would buy it again	1
you can't beat hd picture quality hv20 based actual user reviews comparisons all latest models . while this single cmos sensor , it true 1920 1080 hd sensor same quality found award winning canon digital slr cameras . don't fooled 3ccd camcorder uses smaller sensor sizes must use " pixel shifting " . i already hooked up hv20 my 720p projector , it look great even my typical 120 " . but i know my projector probably isn't calibrated very well honest . so , my first wow moment came when i decided capture some my best outdoor footage my canon elura stock compare it some hv20 footage shot my kids over weekend easter egg hunt . wow , difference quality even more pronounced than i realized . i guess resolution difference what it , but this definitely serious hd quality . real defining wow moment me " selling " all my family friends this camcorder came last night when i hooked it up my brother-in-law house his sony wega crt hdtv display 1080i calibrated perfection . you won't find higher quality hd display than his set imo , my jaw dropped when my video first came up his display first time when i truly able see what my source footage capable terms its full resolution amazing colors . we switched discovery hd his set , other than obvious production value aspects you honestly couldn't really say it looked any more hd than footage my kids playing . this way more exciting me than when i first saw broadcast hd watched monday night football because it hard describe how cool it see your kids video beautiful hd $ 1,000 price point . i hardly wait get out there shoot some more footage .	1
i canon eos rebel which takes fantastic pictures . i use it around home when i am setting up static shots such family portraits . only problem ... who wants lug it around take snapshots . despite some above opinions lack sharpness , i no such problems . 5900 great " grab " shots it not too shabby setting up planned shot using it advanced controls . sure you buy fast memory card . this reduce time shots . most cameras , memory card not supplied camera . mr. goyal review not able take pictures without memory card not true . you take limited number shots internal memeory . only real problem i red-eye reduction feature . i usually turn it off delay " red-eye " flash main flash too long . subjects often think shot over start move . anyway it easy enough remove it later , either photo-software or photo kisok drug store	1

least now it :-) . during course past 10-12 months i owned 7 , that seven , digital cameras : canon s230 ; kodak v530 ; 5 different models casio's: z60 , z600 , z850 , p700 ; most recently presented my wife red s770 valentine day . i also pretty good chance evaluate canon sd450 ( my brother-in-law owns one - it actually gift my wife i him his 21st birthday ) , casio ex-s600 ( good friend mine owns one ) , panasonic dmc-tz1 ( once again , gift my wife i my father-in-law his last birthday ) . if you read any my digital camera reviews ( i've written few now ) , then you know i'm not particularly fond canon lately - i think they overrated overpriced what they offer . i also mentioned before , i've tried several different kodak models ( i used work company too ! ) , but all them turned out waste my time , say least . i became big fan casio , although not all my experiences them great . but huge gadget " freak " i am , constantly wanting new " toys " , i always craved more . over time , my tastes digital cameras changed simple point shoot type camera wishing more power manual control . so one one , i returned/sold all my cameras , after extensive ( i really mean extensive ) research , i got myself lx2 . i must say though i probably wouldn't without getting know my father-in-law tz1 first . i actually quite impressed it . powerful zoom , sharp lens , decent picture quality . i also played some other panasonic models various stores just get better feel them , well spent few hours phone , exchanged numerous e-mails friend mine who owns fz30 , who swears it . unfortunately , lx2 not available anywhere locally , but i felt i got pretty good understanding what panasonic cameras all , after some more thought consideration , i went ahead bought it amazon ( nice thing buying amazon you always return whatever it you bought , including digital cameras , within 30 days full refund , no questions asked ) . i know " noise " issue high iso , but it wasn't decisive factor me , i'm glad i didn't pay much attention it got camera anyway . it turned out one best purchases i've made long while . here why : pros : - superb design . this camera wonderfully crafted . i absolutely love black ! it gives camera nice , clean , professional look . i don't think i'll buying silver camera soon after this one ; - intuitive controls , menus . i charged battery , put it into camera , started using it taking pictures right away , without even going through manual once ; - load features , including large , bright , widescreen lcd ; wide angle , super sharp leica lens 4x zoom ; mega ois - optical image stabilization control ( optical means it mechanically , which true way doing stabilizing , comparing other cameras where it " tricking " camera into using higher iso ); many more . addition , it joystick easy access different menus , number manual controls , well provides ability shoot raw format ( more later ); - it comes silkypix developer studio software working camera raw files . someone who not familiar raw - it " pure " , camera specific picture format . it varies upon manufacturer , meaning canon raw different nikon or panasonic raw , example . it " pure " sense it much better quality than standard jpeg ( jpg ) , doesn't suffer loss information , such white balance , or brightness . there lot more raw than , i'm not going go into details right now . what i want say , however , previously owned camera which supported raw format ( casio ex-p700 ) , i must tried dozen different raw editing software packages , including products adobe , ulead , arcsoft , photofiltre , picture window pro , acdsee , lightzone , image broadway , more . silkypix delivered far best results all . only one i would probably put next it bibble ; - noise - what noise ?! i really hate it when i hear people complaining noise this camera ( after it tried myself ) , or any other compact digital camera matter . you really na�ve you think you get absolutely no noise your images using compact digital camera ? think again . you might noticed i've used word " compact " several times here . i've it purpose - it inevitable compact digital camera produce some noise . some cameras better than others , but no matter how hard you try , you see some . this camera no better or worse than any other one i've had/tried . higher iso ( above 400 ) , it slightly more visible , but who right state mind using anything over iso 200 compact digital camera , such this one , anyway ? i always mine set 100 . if i feel it doesn't get job , i shoot raw ; - picture quality very good . yes , it take some time getting used , but once you familiarize yourself everything this camera capable , you achieve spectacular results , especially if you don't mind doing some post processing . much i like everything this camera offer , there , however , some things kind irritate me . here short list bad things this camera , otherwise known ascons : - first all , this camera actually somewhat misrepresented . it advertised 10.2 megapixel camera , which not entirely true . 10.2 mp resolution available only 16:9 ( wide ) aspect ratio . two more ratios available - 3:2 , more conventional 4:3 , but those offer 8.5 , 7.5 mp resolutions respectively . so if you compare this camera others don't widescreen format , or if you prefer shoot only regular 4:3 mode , then this camera should only referred 7 mp digital camera ( because not all pixels actually effective ) . obviously , panasonic aware it , marketed it higher pixel count purpose , boost consumer interest ; - i expected see compact digital camera . what i got instead actually smaller compact camera than i expected . i really surprised see how small , yet convenient hold operate , camera body . what i didn't like , however , lens . not lens itself , it actually quite superb , but fact it sticks out . i like cameras lenses retract all way back camera body . i realize it would probably loose some features , like wide angle , perhaps zoom , but i still wish it . it would so much more ... umm ... compact ?! way it actually makes it quite difficult find right case it . almost impossible , i should say . i've tried few , but they either too small or too big . i just can't find one would fit right . i put order slx1b case it , which specifically designed fit lx1 , lx2 models , but i hear they not good . we shall see ; - i'm not big fan pop-up flash . i always keep forgetting open it when i need use it . it also seems bit flimsy . i'm treating it carefully i , but i just can't stop thinking it might break soon ; - i hate lens cap !!! there , i said it . it probably just one those small annoyances keep frustrating you until you get used it , but now i'm not really happy it . summary :d espite very few minor negatives , i think lx2 probably one best , most innovative cameras market today , i sure am glad one . it offers more than any other camera same price range , even compete some dslr when it comes picture quality . if you someone like me , who wants more control and/or learn more digital photography , or dslr user who just needs solid backup carry everywhere , then this camera not overlooked ! highly recommended	1
this great camera . quality good camera very durable . i've accidently dropped camera several times , it still works . however , i would suggest getting memory card if you want take more than 24 pictures time .	1
i bought this camera replace my 35 almost couple years back . i am avid nature photographer so most my work taken outdoors . after hundreds pictures all kinds weather here lowdown ... pros ... picture quality amazing even after zooming full 10x ( i never go into digital zoom because low quality pictures , although this camera isn't too bad after complete full optical digital zoom ) . prints i've made up 16x20 " ( haven't gone larger , but i know i ) extremely impressive crisp viewing 4x6 . it easy use functions easy get use joystick . stabilization full 10x zoom incredible also . it appears really shaky through window , but pictures continue turn out crisp . close-ups clear reveal amazingly clear details . movie feature works better indoors than regular camera portion ( read cons ) . cons ... indoor shooting limited because flash isn't strong enough . when school chorus concert , pictures turned out fuzzy unclear . award ceremonies , pictures turned out once again unusable my standards . zoom fixed when using movie feature so you need zoom set before beginning movie . this camera seems eat batteries , especially winter months . i am always go , when i go pull out camera i find camera lens cover fallen off yet again . it comes off way easily causing smudges smears lens so i must always lens cleaner wipes me . viewing window cover also come off lost woods somewhere , but also minor . most cons really all minor things don't interfere amazing quality pictures long you properly prepared those minor issues . i tried precise this camera possible . all all , i would highly recommend this camera avid photographer . if you plan using camera mostly indoor activities , just keep mind flash work good , keep your subjects close . it bumped , jostled , droped couple times camera still works like gem	1
small compact . let me see everyting i wanted	1
i would recommend this anyone looking way take video pictures without hassle lugging around ( charging ) two separate gadgets . it takes excellent pictures , just good if not better than any other digital camera i seen . i am also very pleased video - i found software very user friendly video easy transfer edit my computer . battery good life , i no problems stop recharge it . there nite mode compensates ( very well , i think ) low light video . camera easy carry around ( it smaller than my 35mm ) i am no problems functionality - all all great idea easy use great pictures great video	1
beauty this charger it 110/220v compatable , so appropriate international connector you charge your batteries european voltage . i used two these plug adapters kept four sets batteries charged overnight two olympus cameras giving day plus batteries available each . very few cheap us chargers offer this multi voltage compatability . lots cheaper than multiple voltage convertors . if you plan traveling internationally , this charger must !	1
i bought these binoculars my dad christmas , he absolutely love them . distance it handle slightly above average , but clarity really where this thing shines . its very easy use , held up reasonably well . i would recomend it casual user	1
i got this camera so i could more control . i'm learning use shutter aperture settings ... i haven't explored all fancy settings much , but there tons them . i really like continuous shooting option so i'm more likely catch good action shot . wide-angle lens also allowed me get some pretty cool shots macro settings work great close-ups . i think it one best buys you find if you want take some pretty cool photos , but don't feel quite ready slr	1
seems panasonic finally dropped hammer pseudo dslr market , 420mm 12x or 749mm - 21.4 3mp outstanding especially ois . excellent pictures out box , menu operations plentiful , nr reduced jog dials front back aperture or shutter very professional . leica lens crisp sharp , i shoot aperture priority nr minimal pictures even jpeg look like they post processed , simply amazing . after experiencing this camera i sold my nikon d80 , attachment lens soft pictures nikon giving me unacceptable , i went thru every menu option including using much hyped rgb3 which way gives cartoon colors no comparison panasonic . high speed usb my only complaint data transfers , noise reduction higher iso noise bit over powering but acceptable but controllable your liking , 3 " , screen would nice but maybe next model . btw , moon shots raynox 2020 3mp give zoom 47.08 optical or 1647 mm optical , hand held shots ois ( image stabilization ) enabled gives jaw dropping pictures , you actually telescope ois your reach , simply amazing . 100% satisfied .	1
this not high-tech digital frame . it doesn't play mp3 . it doesn't come remote . it simply reads your digital pictures card displays them slide show mode . there " " button " off " button . there no manual read order learn how operate your frame ( though it come one-page instruction sheet ) . it great your office desk when all you need reach over turn it or off . if you want display it difficul t-t o-reach location , or choreograph your pictures music , then this not frame you	1

i purchased axion 10.4 " frame my wife replace defective polaroid frame different source . axion stacked up quite nicely other " more expensive " frame . axion viewable more angles than polaroid frame cheaper price tag . quality display better axion we not any technical issues . pros : brightness controlcolor contrast displayease setup operationgood sound speakers music playbackcons : slide show transitions top bottom only . different transitions would nice feature . remote not control volume music . overall advantages this frame outweigh disadvantages . we very happy overall this purchase	1
well , i'm just amazed this model still production way things changing so quickly a/v world . i bought mine two years ago recorded many hours my children they growing up . this truly low maintenance low cost solution your video recording needs if you don't lot money spend digital set-up . just buy extra after market battery or two ( they're cheap ) some inexpensive analogue tape , start recording away ! after you climb learning curve , course . my one problem this camcorder controls anything but intuitive , they're splattered all over unit . sure read user manual carefully before you try use this thing , but once you've got it down you'll find this trusty low cost companion your family vacations holidays . oh yeah , almost forgot , microphones aren't stereo but they're really quite good entry level unit	1
very well made . once you holding it you feel price quite low product this solid well designed .	1
i great luck other opteka lenses , but i thread adapter . what thread size this lens here ? i need know before i buy . opteka , please put thread sizes your lenses description . thanks !	1

i am very satisfied this purchase . it exactly what i wanted . i purchased 5 more business gifts important clients	1
i really enjoy this camera ; mine carl zeiss vario-tessar lens . it works grewat- sure use memory stick pro media . great reasonable priced camera	1
i canceled this order because shipment wasn't going arrive time christmas	1
first all i would like say i very reluctant buy sony camera . after doing lot research my needs i ended up canon 800is sony new toy t100 . ofcourse canon best overall ratings ever but i wanted stylish looking camera my needs . sony t100 best looking camera i seen . it features awesome compared it small size . you take it everywhere . big bright screen back clearly visible bright sunlight . it takes good indoor pictures too . i tried play its settings while thought camera not good . but then best feature camera made it winner me . auto mode takes great pictures no need set anything . sometimes changing auto iso helped reduce graniness but very honest if you not going blow image larger sizes ( which would 99% time atleast me ) it won't make difference . just point shoot . you get perfect image viewing computers . no complaints apart optional docking station which costs $80 . 5x optical zoom boon me 3x merely zoom . also zomming while taking movies makes this small camcoder 640x480 30fps shooting . it doesn't touch screen like t50 so it responsiveness better . i would like it bit faster though . also camera takes pictures very fast rate first picture you take less than 2 secs . i would highly recommend this camera anyone who afford it .	1
it pretty hard argue against this prices we're seeing ... short , not so much more than high end bridge cameras ( panasonic dmc-fz50 , fuji s9100 ) you this camera 2 kit lenses . i imagine you'll very satisfied paying difference . 8mp 2 pretty good kit lenses under $650 4/2007 , upgrade path e-510 all lenses accessories . once you make upgrade , what left ask except faster burst mode weather sealing . that 10mp , in-body , sswf live-view . imho , even if you're " entry-level " dslr user , spend extra $400+ get faster 14-54mm 2.8 - 3.5 lens get rid 14-45mm 3.5 - 5.6 lens . 40-150mm 3.5 - 4.5 very nice lens , no real peers entry-level dslr range kit lens i could see without going 3rd party . this lens put olympus over edge me . speed lens over 35mm equivalent range ( 28-300mm ) , i'm not sure what else compete price . if you faster lens longer zoom , you could cough up $800+ 50-200mm 2.8 - 3.5 , even then , that very , very good price kind lens 35mm equivalent range . camera full manual controls , expected dslr , drive newbie like me nuts , but also keep it simple it auto mode numerous scene settings ( which i use good deal ) . if you get this camera , imho , don't bother xd cards . they very slow comparison less expensive cf cards this camera . when it comes time get flash , go extra mile get olympus fl-36 over fl-20 . i'm not sure fl-50 warranted this price point . i lucky find one cheap , so i didn't research 3rd party flashes . i confess pixel-peeper compared high-iso samples this camera canons nikons world . it definitely not bad direct comparison , but after you're resizing touching up photos , you'll never notice , imho . down side , raw files ( . orf ) don't seem compressed , they're not exactly small 14mb . all all , not much complain here	1
combine high iso , low noise fast shutter speed great blur free shots low light moving subjects . this what only fuji offer you compact camera class . f31fd doesn't ( image stabilized lenses or ccd shift sensor ) , which other cameras use reduce effect blur camera shaking . but this kind stabilization really only useful 6x or more zoom , just 3x typical zoom ultra compact ps you just need hold it firmly get same results . also can't prevent blur moving subjects . high iso like f31fd you use faster shutter speeds freeze subjects prevent blur camera shaking too . fuji super ccd sensor provides lowest noise high iso you find 2007 compact cameras , quality only comparable big dslr professional cameras . ah , face detection not just gimmick or marketing appeal ... it really great , specially if someone who doesn't know how focus face then recompose scene taking pictures you , f31fd they not miss shot	1
i've seen this item no less than $7.00 elsewhere , so i got good deal .	1

i agree many reviewers -- mid range wide angle lens superb , but it not quite sharp tele -- one reviewers said -- it many things , not all them perfectly -- lens compromise , but excellent compromise -- vr added boost--i'm still debating whether or not keep it or send it back , because weakness tele -- but there nothing else replace its versatility . -- i don't want keep changing lenses	1

i bought this gift my mother she absolutely loves it ! definitely good buy	1
i purchased this camera 2 weeks ago . i love using it . it lots function play . it easy use . i didnt trouble taking good pictures zoom mode outdoor . indoor , i use tripod if i use zoom . however , i cant really think any occasion i use zoom indoor other than my testing last week . besides , it gives great pictures i loved price . i kind considered dslr camera but i gave it up becasue lenses more expensive than camera itself . i considered one wide angle lense one zoom lense . it would cost me almost 2000 dollarsso far , i love this camera . if this helps anyone considering buying this camera , id give two thumbs up .	1
i got this camera my birthday present january i'm extremely satisfied . i'm very new entire " photography world " , however this camera makes it easy get into . camera smaller than i expected , however it takes great pictures . i use it often pictures while we trips . picture quality great , however screen quality isn't up-to-par other brands . this great value i really like it . my only complaint easyshare software bad . it slow , outdated , doesn't work well overall . i recommend getting 1 gb sd card . i 3 them	1
this 10-20mm lens equivalent 15-30mm 35mm film camera , so it ultra-wide lens 10mm . i pleasantly surprised how sharp images this lens ; it rectilinear , which means straight lines real life remain straight photograph . it well-made lens , made high-grade materials . what this lens excels when you want photograph sweeping landscapes , close-quarters interior photography , architectural photography where you don't mind exaggerated converging lines ultrawide produces . personally , that what i like , so i'm very happy this sigma 10-20mm	1
i shooting away last few weeks . olympus 720 gem . i must filled up my card 3-4 times so far . new digital camera era , i am finding it not hard i thought it would . shoot , pop card into card reader , copy computer , upload walmart photo service , i my prints mailed my house few days . i am happy everything included kit . i would never known what i needed it basically everything covered	1
i just bought this $190 local px . i am impressed so far . i going buy gs180 , but sale price i would crazy pass this up . so far low light much better than single ccd . video playback quiet compared few other camcorders record motor noise onto tape . i plan buying extended battery tripod today same sale . i use this camcorder mostly home videos my son vacations we take around europe . i look froward using this camcorder lot	1

i bought this camera my girlfriend she loves it . it all basic functions her older coolpix abut more they're bit more user friendly . pros : compact easy hold . i've few other point shoots they feel like they going jump out my hand . this one feels pretty good . cons : before buying i read reviews few stating focus not everything it should . i agree . cameras only real big down fall . though my girlfriend may not notice it so much , me it little more aparant . most part , overall i really like this little guy ..	1
works better than i could hoped . i used it month it very simple execute -- but you able hold somewhat steady which not problem me . if you someone who shakes -- may problem . i compared accuracy gps devices guys playing me . this better since it gives you actual yardage pin . also , you get yardage golfer field , yardage any object , bunker , tree etc ., which gps can't . lot courses not marked correctly , , course , yardage changes depending how far off side fairway -- or even out fairway -- you . this where it especially nice . there times when without this device you just flat out guessing . this awesome piece technology . it well worth price me .	1
handy item price . not great telescope , but very useful tool look roof shingles , broken tree limbs , bird nests , etc . must stable , but carried pocket , weighs very little very clear . very good deal .	1
picture dimensions incorrect . it soft case but ribbed horizontally mine came blue . correct dimensions 2.9 " 4.2 " 1.8 " ( wxhxd ) . it also fits fujifilm v10 camera which i bought it . amazon different case built specifically v10 but it costs more might nicer based picture . i am keeping this one , it perfect fit	1
fall through spring i always carry my r817 coat pocket when i go out . this jacket fits my camera like glove . allows access all controls lcd display through clear , heavy duty plastic film , once flap opened . open flap allows lens zoom while still protecting rest camera . only time i zip open jacket remove memory chip or change battery , otherwise , i just leave jacket camera all times .	1
upgrading tz3 4yr old canon 3.2 megapixel . waited few months purchase when i heard tz1 updated . tz3 , panasonic fixed main complaints tz1 which : no build lens cover , noisy images higher iso speeds . imo , build lens cover alone wirth price permium over tz1 . others said , this camera great build quality , easy operation , high-quality look . i ordered black model pleasantly surprised when i opened box . it look retro 35mm cartridge camera , which cool . chrome ( or polished stainless steel , cant tell ) , first rate looks great matte black case . lcd huge bright . camera " simple mode " great job other modes fully customizable . zoom fantastic , but you need really steady hand full zoom , even optical stabilization turned . i take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way my car i came across herd deer . shot shot speed really great , unless you using flash . red-eye reduction works better than any other digital camera i used . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you looking great zoom camera small form factor , you should seriously consider dmc-tz3	1
i this camera six months i still find new features play . one my favorite mode sequence shots . i love its sleek design its durable shell . i carry camera my back pocket , even my tightest jeans . this great camera	1

i just got this camera recently printer . setting up very simple . only problem i came across putting ribbon printer . you use your finger remove slack ribbon but it not easy . when you put ribbon printer it gets caught something could damage ribbon . it takes time tons patients get ribbon printer . pictures come out very nice print even better . i washed couple pictures test quality they came out flawless . this camera value shouldn't passed up . screen camera huge buttons take some time get use too . if you any further questions feel free comment them i'll reply possible	1
this product good its price . mini tripod inside switchgrip looks very good holds my canon pro perfectly . travel bag also very useful	1
this camera exelent camara . it plenty effects , plenty modes , plenty scenery options . image quality 3.2 megapixel , but its quite good . pictures you take without flash end up getting bit blury , where if you take it flash , it comes out exelent . sometimes it takes long time picture get taken out flash , sometimes it happens imediatly . but all these flaws only my version . but if you looking good camera great price , this your best option	1
i bought these trip costa rica used them every day . they comfortable , easy focus , great choice price . these perfect folks like me who interested casual use travel , concerts , sports , etc	1
great product . good value . maybe little slow focusing , compared my old 18-55mm canon lens . good quality pictures . great all one lens	1
i've using this directional mic almost three years never noticed camera noise . it compact provides good reach most ambient sound situations	1
this only second pair binoculars i've owned but i've used many pairs before low end relatively high end ones like nikons leicas . i say without hesitation canon 18x50s met all my expectations clarity , build quality , ease use . they still quite heavy so , you won't holding them too long one position but , stabilization feature provides stable , gitter free image . my opinion , this feature makes up optics may not same league high end stuff : canon 18x50s more usable magnification money non-tripod , hand held applications . while this not scientific comparison , this example useability magnification : i beach looking parasailer distance - naked eye ( 20/20 record ) , i could see chute pattern black speck below it ; my old minolta 10x50s ( jittering my hands)i could make out shapes heads legs ; canon 18x50s , i could clearly see two people , man child well chute cords - pretty impressive . my only two gripes also mentioned before : no lense caps eye cups stiff , fit poorly ( my face any way ) uncomfortable . i find it better fold cups back " eye glass " use even though i don't wear glasses . other than , i am very pleased this purchase would also highly recommend purchasing adorama camera - they quick , accommodating responsive .	1
i sticked sony since i got my first digital camera 4 years ago sony camera moneys worth ! this one dsc-t10 one parent who carrying much already needs pack down change . it fits my purse still space more , only thing remember buy slim fitting case camera extra battery(for those kind battery not sold everywhere ) you need one when you don't thing you need extra battery , you always run out wrong time . i recommend this one	1
when etx-90pe works , it works very well makes astronmomy easy hobby get into . let me elaborate . first , best telescope one you use most often . all too frequently people buy big telescopes heavy carry , need frequent adjustment . little etx weighs less than 20 lbs all set up ( including tripod ) , never needs adjustment . it encourages frequent use . second , one most challenging aspects astronomy , especially newcomer , finding objects look . if you not familiar night sky where things located , it get very frustrating spending up 30 minutes just find one object look ! etx built computer makes finding objects easy - just select what you want see menu , scope automatically point i t.t he optical quality etx excellent . manufacturer , meade , very good job turning out optical systems rank best . some most rewarding objects - moon , jupiter , saturn , orion nebula look wonderful through this telescope . one final positive mention ease setup . pe models easiest all telescope get up running . just turn power , press one key hand held computer controller , few moments telescope start aligning itself so it automtically find objects you . you don't need worry where north , or what current date , time , location . now some cautions . first , etx-90 small telescope , not show much larger one . trade-off getting portable instrument . there larger etx models almost portable , so these might consideration . also , understand there learning curve when using built computer . it not hard , but you need some patience while you learn procedure . finally , prepared some quality control issues . good optics , some etx some mechanical problems require return factory warranty repair . my own etx-90pe go back factory twice . but once all problems fixed , it well worth it ! this note , you purchase extended warranty manufacturer reasonable price , i would recommend doing so	1
this digital camera awesome . i no problem batteries . i made sure i put good batteries ( no cheap ones ) . i looked purchasing canon hp but features it this one outstanding price . i purchased this camera 1gb card it . i can't wait start using it when i go san diego march ..... awesome digital camera ...... you won't sorry this purchase ...	1
i bought this camera replace high mp sony pocket camera , i am thrilled it . picture quality absolutely gorgeous any lighting . red eye reduction really works , gets rid red-eye before it ever gets memory card . it compact flash card memory system , which great because big compact flash cards much more afforadable than other types cards . this camera better than my brother canon slr terms picture quality , but not nearly bulky cumbersome . battery life fantastic . one other nice feature screen top camera which lets you see how many pictures you , batter life , mode , etc without opening screen . only drawbacks this camera ( 1 ) not biggest zoom lens , but plenty enough typical photographer , ( 2 ) screen could bigger , but still acceptable , ( 3 ) when you screen open , you can't use viewfinder , which little annoying , but not big deal . i owned 4 other high-end digital cameras this far best one i ever used .	1
this seemingly simple piece molded plastic recommended me professional photographer . basically it shape open box slides firmly onto flash . it small sturdy enough stash your camera bag without worrying damage . when used light disperses more evenly less harsh subject photographed . white box general use . also available green omni-bounce florescent lighting gold omni-bounce warming effect . pros : inexpensive solution better flash photography . quality product works . cons : non	1

before i get k10d , i experienced olympus e-500 , canon xti , nikon d80 . i used olympus e-500 take lots vivid color pictures i love very much , but no water resistance no second display window , also only 3 focus point makes it not so enjoyable . same thing happen canon xti , no water resistance no second display window make it little hard use when you need change settings . nikon d80 great camera but also no water resistance shake reducer build camera , color tone d80 isn't kind i would love . finally i bought pentax k10d , feeling body , water resistance , shake reducer , auto dust remove , vivid color tone , etc ... makes me feel k10d way go . only complaint would limited edition lens hard get . get it while you	1

i am writing offset some negative opinions this unit . i bought canon because it facilities external mike . i am new camcorder user so no practical experience bias my opinion one way or . first matter tape drive noise : yes i hear it if i put unit up my ear . but no noticeable noise comes up actual movie clips when played back through my computer . second , they claim you interconnect capture clips your computer . what they don't tell you you need firewire card cable ( $70.00 total best buy ) . you cannot simply hook up through available computer usb port . fortunately , microsoft provides necessary drivers xp os minimal capture software called " moviemaker " . i am not too pleased tape system but considering price unit , i think it bargain . finally , i become aware through short experience unit ergonometric design right hand very well thought out . your thumb easily controls on/off tape transport functions . it really easy use , least right handed users . all considered , i am satisfied product . course , if it dies next week , i different opinion	1

this great buy if you just wanting some fun , no real investment . although it go beyond 17 feet , not far you may think . but , i used it while snorkeling pictures turned out great , i am sure few more than 17 feet .	1
pros : compact , lightweight , portability , easy use , big screen , good reproductioncons : microphone sensitive wind , getting used not viewfinder , bad low light performance . summary : i picked this camera upgrade my old canon zr10 . first reason i chose it small size portability . good light conditions , this little beast its best shots , but low light conditions this camera disapointed me ( specially compared mi old zr10 ) . please don't buy it if you plans use it stills shots because it low resolution . included handycam station all ports ( firewire , usb , power , video ) you need conect it . big touch screen must , because screen only way access camera controls ( besides some them edge screen ) . you camera more characteristics better image quality same price , but if your concern size portability this your best choice world mini dv format	1

part definitely up nikon awesome standards . i bought it future use , i don't currently lens yet , but when price becomes affordable i purchase it too	1
this best price i found my second rechargeable battery my nikon coolpix 5200 . it perfect , so nice second battery !!! it shipped so fast , i received it within few days	1
this pretty good camera , loaded lots features . pros include 10x optical zoom , use sd card , battery consumption . also , this camera you ability buy add-ons such zoom lenses such - makes it nice those just past beginner experience . there couple cons i've found , most important picture quality . although it capability take great photos , you make sure wait several seconds shots ensure they'll come out looking great ( my opinion , anyway ) . size okay , although it kinda bulky so small . i prefer something size also slim - it not so easy carry around because this . overall , this camera very easy use	1
nice portable background support kit . stability might issue but if portability your first concern then you overcome stability issues weights or caution . easy quick put up . i put it up myself very little effort . all rolls up nice compact bag transporting	1
i bought canon powershot a70 . they say your best camera one you use most , man i use it . i'm high schooler , so i dont much money , but a70 , i attach this adapter ( la-dc52c ) my camera , i more photographic freedom lenses , alot less money . you this adapter first . then any lense which fits ( most ) , used ... good idea canon !!!	1
well , this lens work wonderfully expand your angle better shots , but if you don't good lighting , you end up pictures worthless . i suggest never using this poor indoor lighting flash comes dx6490 not clear top wide angle lens therefore becomes useless . best outdoor shots or areas where overhead backlighting sufficient enough take pictures without use flash . plan ahead before just attatching lens taking pictures . also remember because you can't use flash option , you need stabilize camera better avoid blurry shots . otherwise , this lens excellent . it fits easily into my camera bag , simple attach ( lens converter course ) takes great shots without fisheye effect . other than inability use my flash lens , i think it great	1
just like any other minidv tape . good pric	1
i received this product timely manner . it exactly what i needed . thank you	1
after springing cybershot august so i could compact camera i would actually take places , i've very , very pleased . last camera i older sony dsc quite bulky , ran batteries , shutter problems -- but it took great quality pictures interface features perfect , so i thought i would go dsct5 , since it avoids all those problems . only tiny battery charge , no sticky shutter ... it sexy hell . screen huge very bright . i hate taking pictures flash general , i find flash makes nasty redeye more often than not this camera . ( camera gives you impression you cant change shutter speed or anything ) however ! you easily change this going into over/under exposure options under exposing your photos when you dark environments . they come out surprisingly well blur-free	1
some reviewers below said this microphone doesn't work sony hot shoe . wrong . click " technical details " this page you'll see sony camcorder models this microphone works . failure look which camcorders compatable this microphone fault customer , not any fault microphone ! so don't give it low rating based your own lack research when buying product , please	1
this camera great investment . photos turn out wonderfully . better than regular film camera i kept eye out simular cameras ... price wise we got fantastic deal this camera it well worth price . only problem i found it batteries wear out soooo fast but i think all digital cameras problem . this great camera	1
i bought this camera just before trip ca then cruise ! it very easy operate ( even techno-retard like me ) pictures turned out great ! i started use filming feature recently my video recorder my son @ college i want film my daughter drill team performances ! i really like fact it doesn't turn while my purse !!! my old camera couple times , i ended up quite few pictures contents my purse - anyone want one ? ( lol ) all all , great buy ! 8 months later lcd display gone ! literally , gone ! don't know what happened - took pictures/movies daughter drill team performance , when i got it out again take pictures before sadie hawkins , it would still take pictures ( i just downloaded them ) but since display looks like " piece plaid fabric marijuana leaf coming right side " i don't know what i'm taking picture ! need replace soon ! i'm ( now ) bummed	1
very good camera . this present my wife she needed new camera . she picked it out liked it came complete kit . directions hard follow times could printed larger . takes some getting used . zoom lense works great takes good pictures . where on-off button so close shutter , you careful you don't accidentally shut camera off . she very satisfied it .	1
after setting booby traps zombies , i like whip out my bushnell waterproof scope wait oncoming herds trample . this scope just great because it cuts down glare also waterproof . it good some foreward advancement options when dealing zombies so when you set up this scope give you good range spotting them your trail !!	1
this adapter only one available hd1 while it good job protecting 1st lense whichever 49 mm one you attach , there problem when you use flash pictures things within 10 feet . there dark semicircle bottom your pictures where flash blocked adapter . i've gotten around this using adapter attached lens lens cap attached string camera . whenever i need take picture flash something up close ( within 10 feet ) i pop off whole setup take picture if entire piece giant lens cap regular camera . hope helps	1
i enjoy all features this item . main compartment hold camera soft secure . you open it without worrying your camera falling off . back compartment roomy enough all basic gear . slot memory cards 1-4 ( depends card type ) , batteries ( roomy four aa ) , cables fit i t.t he shoulder strap basic looks flimsy . it not long enough hold comfortable diagonally but side good . belt loop very secure fit belt three inch width . it even handle worst environment ever . hot , dry climate sandstorms occasional accidental drops . it protected my dig . camera very well	1
i bought this my wife so she could pull out camera , turn it , take nice photo . flash works well , unlike some reviews i've read . battery life appears fine also . this small , light camera , measuring 3 1/2 " wide , 2 1/4 " tall , 3/4 " deep when turned off . not exactly credit card , but likely close one you're gonna get . camera opens up instantly , takes nice photo whether or without flash , battery life appears ok , controls easy use -- either figuring them out or using your fingers them . nice big screen 2 1/4 1 1/2 , so you easily see what going -- nice plus . this camera also nice " reminder " listing right display , so you see flash setting ( , off , etc . ) , iso setting those you use , very nice way access other controls shown auto focus , self-timer , antishake , iso sensitivity , white background ( am i losing you yet ? ) , so . one point remember this listing arranged most-likely-to-use least-likely , so user interface strong consideration design this camera . i've gotten some nice pictures this , without flash . nice pick . why not 5 stars ? cuz i've also bought more expensive digital camera gives me more choices , although price this camera fine it'd one i'd buy again , but it isn't equal dig cams 6x optical zooms , separate iso settings , all those other techie things , frankly , aren't important lot users but which need considered rating . buy carrying case , i , so camera doesn't get scratched or lost cuz it'z so small . i don't any " special fear " this but it also easy buy small carrying case stash this into , so why not it ? all my reviews , i no financial interest one way or other what i review . also , don't forget you likely want bigger memory card store pix , maybe second battery swap out when needed . consider these additional costs , but also consider these additional costs apply any camera you buy .	1
i've this camcorder week now i think it works great .. except touch screen feature . takes little getting used .. especially when accessing special features ( such fader effects ) while filming . digital still quality poor when recording directly memory stick .. but same images taken still prerecorded tape much clearer . all all it good product .. just takes some getting used	1
this one best camcorders market today i would definitely recommend it anyone planning buy mini-dv camcorder positive factors : - very small easy hold one hand . easily attached even mini-tripod ease . - excellent widescreen video hi-fi audio . your videos finally get " hollywood " feel when you shoot movies 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format ) . even if you don't widescreen tv currently , you very soon one more more people buying them . so its better buy this camcorder shoot 16:9 format enjoy your movies later widescreen format . - includes widescreen rotatable lcd so what you see what you get when you shoot 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format ) - good battery life . one extra battery enough . you easily manage day worth shooting two batteries before recharging them again - includes docking station making it easier connect computer or tv . if you good computer firewire port , please buy firewire cable connect camcorder your computer . you download your movie excellent clarity . avi format edit it required - make sure change audio setting 16 bit ( instead default 12 bit ) very good hi-fi audio - touchscreen menu system great . you don't search any buttons they all available touchscreen menu itself . - 10x optical zoom more than sufficient ordinary home videos . anything more produces more " shaking " would necessiate use tripod . when you shoot without tripod , 10x best zoom you achieve without worrying shaky videos - widescreen still photo . photo clarity ok not too good . so please don't expect great shots . since photo 16:9 format , you take panoramic photos cover more people group shots - nightshot : cool feature records using infrared light . useful shooting night you record video even 100% darkness - color widescreen viewfinder - very useful when you running down batteries need use viewfinder . color widescreen viewfinder gives excellent picture good lcd clarity negative factors : - outdoor videos especially bright sunlight overexposed . so please adjust white balance when shooting outdoors . add white-balance menu your shortcuts so you easily access it return default once you start shooting indoors - sensitive microphone may pick up button clicks ( best turn off button click " beep " sound ) . notes : - use fresh cassette after recording 2 or 3 times same cassette . head tends get dirty if you re-record same cassette more than 3 times - you edit movies windowx xp using windows movie maker , but beware it not support 16:9 ratio video . hence your videos look ugly you shot them 16:9 but movie maker converted it 4:3 . invest pinnacle software version 9 or 10 better movie editing capabilities . pinnacle only software , i am aware , preserves teh 16:9 ratio . even roxio could not allow 16:9 format . - you also invest wide-angle lens it gives excellent coverage	1
great add-on xacti hd1 , but two minor problems i've found so far . 1 . i can't use circular polarizing filter wide angle lens it cuts off corners picture ; 2 . flash photography won't work pop-up flash becomes obscured barrel add-on lens	1
very small easy carry . neat zoom , bit hazy image stabilization but overall good buy buck	1
[ below my recent review jvc everio gz-mg40 , which 20gb hard drive rather than 30gb . becase gz-mg50 seems identical gz-mg40 save hard drive capacity , i thought this review would useful those considering buy gz-mg50 . ] ---------------------------------------- i using this camcorder almost two weeks now . here my impressions : pros : ) this tiny camcorder i easily carry it my pocket everyday . ) it records directly [ 30gb ] harddrive . this probably most amazing feature this camera . it following amazing benefits : ( 1 ) huge recording space ( 2 ) random access recorded videos when browsing ( through thumblist videos ) ( 3 ) super fast transfer onto your computer through usb 2.0 . ( 4 ) no tapes , no cds , no dvds worry while recording video . ( 5 ) facilitates easy archiving/organizing . example , all recorded files camera harddrive " creation date " part their file information . when camera connected your computer , you sort all files date easily separate all recordings date different folders simply selecting dragging . ( this extra , but if you want index able search your video files , say google desktop , simply enter list keywords file name contents file . ) ( 6 ) harddrive your camera double additional portable storage media- this unlikely but if you wanted you could even install linux it carry you operating system your camera . ) video quality good consumer level video camera . sound quality recorded through internal microphone good : i hear lectures i record very clearly there no annoying noise generated camera . ) charger comes this camera very small . so you carry around well worry less running out battery . cons : ) no mic jacks . ) manual focus light adjustments through menus . ) editing software comes it limited . ) battery life mere hour(but you buy 3 hour battery 70-80 dollars ) . all camcorders , still images shot this camera not level quality you get good still camera . it produces reasonable snapshots well lit situations . video files recorded this camera " . mod " extension their name . i replace " . mod " " . mpg " most my standard video viewing software automatically recognize files	1
i looked everywhere this charger . everywhere town wants me buy something else might work . it great finally find actual charger comes camera . it just right size plugs right into wall . prongs fold down fit nicely carry-on bag . thanks so much this item available	1
i waited long time canon come out image-stabilized binoculars 100% waterproof design . these worth wait . i bought mine specifically cruise up alaska inside passage . one our sight-seeing excursions 45-foot boat heavy seas . fellow this trip massive set fujinon 16x40 gyro-stabilized binoculars sell nearly $ 6,000 . we spent time comparing my canon binoculars his fujinons . optically there no comparison . canons , while not superb optically best leica binoculars , awfully good . they far brighter , much sharper , more accurate their color rendition than fujinons . only reason spend extra $ 4,500 + fujinons if you require absolute best image stabilization money buy . if you using binoculars very severe conditions ( high seas , etc . ) you get better performance gyro-stabilization fujinons . 99% applications you get far better results canons . though fujinons higher their rated magnification only time you'll see difference under conditions where motion severe . calmer seas ( not calm , just not severe ) you better off canons ; fuji so much dimmer lacking clarity canons make up magnification difference fairly quickly . finally , waterproof aspect these binoculars really worth . above-mentioned trip we buffeted rain spray waves . canons functioned flawlessly without hitch , cleaned up nicely afterwards . these one best products i've ever used , lived up their performance claims every regard . one point note : if you want maximum battery life it well worth buying lithium aa batteries use these binoculars ; this greatly extend your battery life , particularly cold weather	1
i bought these binoculars my dad christmas , he absolutely love them . distance it handle slightly above average , but clarity really where this thing shines . its very easy use , held up reasonably well . i would recomend it casual user	1
i like bag . pleanty pockets pouches all my little small accessories . just wish it little better suited 2 cameras like i . but , everything fits ... comfortable haul around all day . nice pads straps secure it my back . well padded equipment . i'd highly recommend it anybody	1
this item great .... i love it ... i my 35 mm digital camera it everything else i need ..	1
this very good product , price cheap , come bag which plus , if you looking cheap but sturdy monpod , this right one , highly recommanded	1
optika mp100 pro photo monopod surprisingly sturdy , functional well-made . it supplied reasonably decent quality zippered nylon case carrying strap . no , it not " professional grade " , but it something every amateur photographer use weekend shooting . i've used it both digital still camcorder , where it offers respectable improvement long-distance shots ( versus trying hold camera still , or propping it up roof car , not-nearby-enough fence post , so . ) certainly lot handier than old tripod ! i bought two , keeping them ready-for-action trunk my cars . highly recommended	1
not knowing fully what i getting into , whim i purchased this monopod hoping half-way decent product , i mean-it so cheap . i pleasantly surprised find how sturdy unit what i very high quality monopod . this my second monopod so i compare it ( other bought auction website ) . comparison opteka far better monopod height robust thickness i use it exclusively my minidv shoots	1
i got this lens shooting architecture distance -- unsual application . i've also found myself using it shoot kids soccer games . it super sharp very fast focusing . i haven't formal tests all apertures , but images appear vivid contrasty range settings . online reviews rank this lens very highly my own experience supports those findings . image stabilization seems work very well , although sure turn it off if you're using tripod--i've found it reduce image quality if you forget turn it off application . shots where you'll standing around lot lens your eye , ready shot , it gets kind heavy carry . if you're shooting sports , you might want consider monopod . other applications , its weight low enough not too big problem . it comes canvas-like case includes loop you use attach it your belt . i've found this works pretty well out field , particularly when combined photo-vest . case also carried neck strap , but this gets way your camera strap also thin , so it kind cuts into your shoulder . i write this , amazon site link 58mm filters this lens . it takes 77mm filters	1
i got this lens complement my 10-22mm 100-400mm lenses . it great general purpose lens ( not too wide , not too narrow ) everyday walk around shooting . image stabilization constant aperture nice features . it also weather sealed so you don't worry elements much most other lenses , course you would need weather sealed camera body completely safe , but it still makes me feel little better sandy or snowy conditions . i use this rebel xt rebel xti which 1.6 crop bodies make this closer 38-168mm which useful portrait work , landscapes , large animals , or somewhat close macro . course there lenses all these things better , but get this all one package really valuable . after all you less likely miss shot if you 1 versatile lens vs . 5 really great specialized lenses ( not you shouldn't get those too , but this good all around contender . ) i posted few photo examples above show range colors versatility this lens . it not sharpest lens i , nor fastest , but it one my camera most often unless i am going out shoot something specific . if you don't want spend quite much , 28-135mm also very good lens	1
my first lens i'm sold . while i spend lot time - lot , this isn't small purchase - deciding this 24-70/ 2.8 , i feel i made right decision . first , i took into account what i actually shot . not what i thought shooting or wanted shoot , but what i really spent my time shooting . then i backed up looking past six months ' worth photos . me , this right choice . big decision wasn't over image quality - rather it max aperture . 2.8 vs 4.0 . 4.0 won . i absolutely love ! even higher speeds , rocks . ( it also eats batteries like hummer guzzles gas)ok , so shooting it dream . incredibly fast focus . wonderful fit finish . i could gush all night . if you're spending lot time trying justify it , don't . if it won't break your bank , it well worth it . if you're trying decide which lens , try what i . it made all difference me . what downside ? i'm ordering 17-40 today . lens bug bitten . next 70-200/ 2.8 . there goes kids college fund . : -	1
while it isn't fashionable use anything but zoom lens anymore , this series 135mm fixed focus lens " real deal " . it superbly sharp , fast , easy use . i took it africa me astounded its brilliant clarity . great portraits ... anything requiring mid-length telephoto . highly recommended	1
recent nye event , i shot lot photos concert setting without flash am very impressed sharpness clarity this lens performance . its so fast colors vibrant . i am not seasoned pro but 20d this lens , it makes me look pretty close . i shoot manual once i got my aperture shutter speed dialed , it pumped out lot great pics . i also shot some pics waterfalls ( slowing down my shutter speed get soft flowing image ) portraits people again , it oozed excellence . 135mm focal range not convenient zoom , but quality this prime lens makes up any incovenience	1
i recently purchased this lens 24-105mm part fall cash cannon rebate program . so , originally , my main reason get this lens because it would save me $50 off other lens via doubling rebates make it pretty cheap . but now i used it awhile , i am really happy i got it . 1.8 maximum aperture two things really well , lets you take low-light handheld shots isolates subject . see my example photos examples both these features . i use this canon rebel xt rebel xti which 1.6 crop factor make this lens more like 135mm which good bad depending your usage . this lens produces very sharp results doesn't weigh much , so it easy carry around . if you already good range zoom lenses looking something just take really nice , sharp , handheld shots , consider this lens	1
bought this my daughters karate tournements i am very pleased quality pictures i gotten . this baby never comes off my xt	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens . i got this filter friend mine his nikon 18-70mm ed dx lens .	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
10d outstanding digital camera . i using both mine over year now they everything i needed , when i needed it , wthout single flaw . i really use 10d . i taken over 30,000 pictures it . i use optional 2 battery bg-ed 10d which gives me easy 400 pictures . 17-40 canon zoom lens worked spotlessly well . pictures crisp . easy manual focus auto focus works well even low light . i like solid feel 10d , especially 2 battery pack , 550ex flash . i shoot exclusively manual mode so i can't comment other settings . adjusting flash output , iso etc all easy quick . i found this very intuitive camera . viewing screen back camera clear gives me good feedback adjusting my flashes or hot lights . i use lexar 1gb compactflash cards . i carry epson p-2000 multimedia storage viewer my back up . only drawback i found couple my women friends who found it bit heavy . i not only gotten use its weight but come really appreciate " feel " camera . i tell you i never use film again . epson photo 2200 printer , iphoto my own digital darkroom thanks photoshop cs i everything i need right here home . downloading pictures my macintosh g4 or powerbook i use firewire sandisk reader . it too works perfectly . so if you don't need increased megapixal 20d i would suggest you consider 10d . one great camera .	1
this timer/cable release lot features . works well . cord somewhat short though , it cheap plastic construction . hard imaging it costs this much . i think it over priced . but it job .	1
i this product over two years used it extensively my travels . yes it shortfalls " may " considered expensive , but price it better than some other " aftermarket " designs other camera makes . amature timelapse timed exposures it works quite well . far remote instant low light or exposure shots it expensive , get canon rs-80n3 shutter releasethe biggest complaints seems limited number shots [ 99 ] certain modes shortness connecting cable length . using " continous " mode i not failed capture timelapse photos filled my needs . short connecting cable corrected purchasing canon et-1000n3 extension cable [ 33 ft ] . now $2.50 + foot , expensive ! but my persuit remote control capability must . battery life fantastic , thousands shots still going strong . course like camera battery spare blessing [ this case cheap ] . i think it good accessory , if you enjoy time lapse spent money one new eos cam then price comparable your continuing outlay your hobby .

i bought this flash my canon 30d because numerous promises canon makes how it performs all 30d automatic manual functions ... they right ! spite it relatively small size , it most powerful flash i've used any brand . replaced non-canon brand flash supposed work 30d but didn't , i could not more delighted 580x . whether you're shooting av , tv , , or modes , you not disappointed its performance . it expensive ; but it worth price if you rely your flash perform your camera capabilities	1
580ex wonderful flash i would not hesitate buy it again . fact i might even buy second one . there however couple issues you should aware . 1 . battery compartment door takes little getting used . you may feel like you going snap it off first . not really big deal though . 2 . ( my opinion this big deal ) . `auto focus assist ' completely useless . its just led pointed through rather bad `lens ' . it won't anything past couple feet . laser diode diffraction grating would made it work far past useable flash distance this price canon should know better . all told however it wonderful flash . circular command dial make adjusting flash exposure easy ( dial more or less flash relative ambient light ) . if you not external flash get one . it makes huge difference . this great offering .	1
excellent performance , reasonable price . highly recomend this product	1
this seemingly simple piece molded plastic recommended me professional photographer . basically it shape open box slides firmly onto flash . it small sturdy enough stash your camera bag without worrying damage . when used light disperses more evenly less harsh subject photographed . white box general use . also available green omni-bounce florescent lighting gold omni-bounce warming effect . pros : inexpensive solution better flash photography . quality product works . cons : non	1
i am technology guru this camera simple use great results . touch screen awesome !!! battery life so much better than other cameras i owned . i think this one outlast perform any them . buy it now if you want quality camera make you happy !!	1
camera works great us so far ... we 3 year old digital camera so this upgrade better technology ... takes much better pictures than our old one ... video great ( except very low light ) ... we've taken lot short video clips our kids grandma ( etc ) ... nobody our family wants watch more than 5 minutes any one home video anyway ... so this camera saves us buy camcorder ... ( although our 1gb card we could take 45 minutes or so continuous video medium setting ) ... touch screen great simple ... camera quick response time indoor action pictures again great pictures our kids running around or birthday parties ... i took 92 minutes video 55 pictures ( plus sharing images videos others ) before battery ran out first time ( couple weeks shooting our family ) . i guess everyone their own needs when picking digital camera , but this one works great ours	1
if you would like list sites reviews email gumby ( ) dontquotemeonthat ( dot ) com pros : great sharpness even wide open ( wayyyyy better than 2.8 zooms 2.8 ) . nice weight size . shallow dof wide angle lens . cons : lateral ca glows purple green close distant bokeh . watch high contrast situations . my first copy doa . no weather seal . hood too tight . pros : fantastic ! this one excellent piece glass . incredible low light , vibrant clarity color . well balanced 20d/batter pack or 1d . cons : none what so ever . if your newbie here some info lens " fast " when it low f-stop ... ok so when you smaller number apature bigger which allows more light through , so this means you up shutter speed . still enough light reach sensor . ok so lets say you out door shot if you say f/4 lens shutter speed could 1/250 second you would get good exposer . now this lens only go f/4 but if you same outdoor setting , f/ 2.8 lens you could jump 1/500 second get same exposer . freeze action mmore effectivly , this i believe why it " fast " lens . ok fun get it	1
what great little piece kit . it great my ef 70-200mm f/4l . only drawback you've no af . you forced use manual focus . now this isn't big problem , unless you're photographing wildlife or moving objects . well worth price though very useful	1
manufactured soft gray felt like material , tough leather bottom , draw string closure top , this lens pouch helps protect your lens dust elements . i store my lenses camera bag , these cases fit nicely around lens taking up little precious space . this case meant use canon ef 135mm f/2l usm , ef 24-70mm f/ 2.8 usm , ef 24-105mm f/ 4.0 usm , ef 28-70 f/ 2.8 , ef 50 f/ 1.0 usm , ef 85mm f/ 1.2 usm lenses . these lenses normally come case when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . however if your case worn , replacing it protect your lens recommended . pros : protects your glass investmentcons : i cannot think	1
i weddings , portrait , outdoor photography i don't see any reason why i'd ever switch d70 ( other than d80 :) . this camera professional grade consumer price point . don't scared 6.1 mp . i print 20x30 all time w/ out any problems . i'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1
it learning curve , that sure , but wow ! this camera worht every penny , far more stable then comparable canon rebel , product comes better lenses . quality glass matter	1
this camera excellent one !! really when you compare its price its results level quality you get you know why this best its category , i'm getting very professional results using it lot styles .. highly recommended	1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
i decided get this after buying rebel xti already owning rebel xt ( this works both . ) i already corded shutter release which nice when doing long exposures or macro work where even little camera shake make huge difference . but this goes new level , you set camera up get everything focus then step back take many shots you want without any risk touching camera . make sure cover eyepiece when using this so stray light doesn't ruin your exposure . this also handy when you want take pictures you them . i even used it two cameras once get multiple angles same shot . i am thinking setting up blind setting up camera tripod try get some close up pictures wildlife would not possible otherwise . basically if you ever need take pictures without holding camera this your solution	1
i bought this remote canon digital rebel xt . pretty much programs itself . great asset it clips camera strap . works good distance . highly recommen	1
impressive feature list wih affordable price , serious ameteur . i've using 20d 18-55 , 50mm 1.8 , 35-80 , 80-200 500/1000mm lenses . i am not disappointed . i am planning upgrade series lenses but slowly . i not mean over entusiastic canon , but i am yet see nikon camera same specs same or ever near equal price . i've got fm10 film photography . i love both my cameras . impressive features include : mirror lockupiso 3200 noise reduction18 custom functionsaccepts entire series canon lens . heavy metal body ( no cheap plastic feel	1
i purchased this lens primarily use macro lens . since i shoot mostly wildlife ( including bugs ) i thought field view 160mm ( used my canon rebel xt ) would just ideal . reality fl not enough . i approach bugs much too close they frequently left scene quickly . pictures taken lens extremely sharp bocah ( out focus area behind subject ) very nice . i wound up selling lens ebay since it didn't meet my needs	1
this fantastic piece glass . extremely sharp little artifacts . awesome lens i recommend highly . i love going local botanical gardens mounting this baby my 20d . well worth cost . if you dont tripod , buy one	1
" wow ! " all i say express my reaction after getting prints taken my 17-40 . i've using nikon manual-focus nikkors since 1988 always satisfied color sharpness . however , after using canon " " series , i've sold lot my nikkors . color , clarity , sharpness , detail " " lenses amazing . prints this 3-d effect ( without use those silly red/blue glasses ! ) 8-) within 3 weeks receiving my 17-40 , i ordered 70-200 . those two lenses replace my whole nikkor collection . build really good . " " zooms little bulkier , but very managable . nikkors smaller , but very heavy . but lense technology coatings improved so much 20 years , i see difference . i tested lens pointing it toward sun . 17-40 surprising handles flare very well . sun just outside field view , there very little flare loss contrast . i also make 12x18 prints , this lens handles them easily . body going limiting factor ( refering digital bodies ) . warning : once you use " " glass , you going spoiled . you may not settle consumer lenses anymore , although some non-l lenses quick good what i read	1
this great lens . i use it full-frame film digital slrs , love getting ultrawide shots . however , if you cash , you'll probably happier 16-35/ 2.8 lens , f4 pretty slow indoors	1
owned distortion-prone nikkor afs 17-35 2.8 six years , it time switch over canon ef 17-40 mm f4l usm . canon version over $1000 cheaper , optically superior lighter weight . me , outstanding standard lens when coupled canon 5d . vignetting f4 minimal . adobe photoshop cs2 vignetting tool correct vignetting . distortion 17mm minimal . less than canon ef 16-35 mm 2.8 usm set 16 mm . 5d pointed blue sky , ef 17-40 hunted focus point while ef 16-35 didn't . flaring minimal when compared ef 16-35 . portraits taken 40 mm produced better results than ef 16-35 afs 17-35 35 mm . images produced f4 sharp . f8 , images very sharp . this lens definite keeper .	1
i seen glowing reports this lens several magazines , most notably shutterbug . it truly splendid performer one well worth paying if photographer needs extra working distance afforded macro lens 180mm 200mm range . its performance certainly good , if not better , than nikon venerable 200mm f4 micro nikkor , which one first - if not first - telephoto macro lenses this focal length . this canon lens excels not only macro photography but also nature photography , getting close-up images animals wild without working too close disturb them . if i owned canon equipment , then this lens would essential part my kit	1
product top quality product . filters work excellent my canon powershot s2 . without doubt , worth every penny , especially considering price i paid it , which least half where i saw it listed other places . very happy purchase	1
backpack holds all my stuff extra room . only thing i thought i ordering bag not backpack based picture shown . backpack little heavy side me but i like it	1
absolutely love this camera bag ! i hate dealing purse camera bag while traveling , so i just carry this bag . everything i need ( wallet , cell phone , car keys chap stick ) plus all camera equipment fit just fine this bag . you can't go wrong this . my husband even hold it me since it not purse !	1
this bag small , but it fits my canon rebel xt kit lens battery grip . i also carry 50mm/ 1.7 lens there still room manual , battery charger other small components . i getting bigger bag when i start acquiring more lenses , but it great now summer travel . it also looks nice very sturdy	1
you know , i researched this lens again again . i put it my christmas list . year half went i finally just bought it . my gosh , everything true ! this one world great lenses . what piece glass . image stabilization i take candid shots candlelit restaurant using available ligh t.t he lens magical . it captures soul its subjects . nature photography phenomenal . this incredible tool take you new level . just it ! no regrets . honest .	1
i am portrait professional photographer over 40 years . i needed wide angle lens weddings wanted know quality kit lens . i test using rebel xt kit lens canon 16-35mm lens which costs somewhere around $ 1,500 . i set both cameras 18mm focal length tripod . i took shots outdoors indoors . images exactly same . outdoor shots show objects infinity well 10 ' away . i made 8x10 prints showed them my fellow professional photographers . nobody could identify which lens took which . this real world scenario	1
many people think this kit lens . it not ! numbers match , but kit lens not usm worth 1/2 price . go canon web site take look lens chart . this lens much faster better glass than kit lens .	1
compare price product i highly recommend any one who own canon eos camera ...	1
awesome lens , especially price . it very fast 50mm even 1.6 mag my rebel xt easily manageable	1
my 2 year old really active my point shoot camera cannot keep up him . i also don't like washout look when i uses flash . so i researched which slr best meet my needs , mainly catching fast action , candid moments low light photos without flash . canon 30d comes up top list . it best high iso performance its class ( better than nikon sony ) . when i combine 30d fast zoom lens ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 , result amazing . i stop any action daylight , capture every candid expression my 2 yr old fast burst mode , take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod . portraits also excellent sharp image beautifully blurred background ( bokeh ) . even dimly-lit decors disneyland haunted mansion came out superb when we went there halloween party night , without flash or tripod . this really important factor me buy this camera , taking pictures tripod not option when your subject active 2 yr old . but you need good lens make this work well . if you use cheap kit lens , then it probably not matter which camera you pick . remember these 3 all very good cameras small differences image quality you see reviews apparent only when they use best prime lens ( not kit lens)and crop pictures magnify details . sony very good choice if you budget don't need low light performance ( use flash save money ) . nikon more custom function than canon , it really good canon . they both their strength weakness . canon just happens slightly better high iso performance suits my need better than nikon . fair , i should mention nikon d200 tops most reviews camera year , beating canon 30d overall . but d200 bit too advanced amateur like me , better suits someone more serious photography . d80 like " mini " d200 , but slower . so it really boils down what you really need how much you want spend . shooting low light without flash need good high iso performance , good fast lens ( wide aperture , usually expensive ) , image stabilization . if that what you want , canon 30d ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 not disappoint you	1
this camera incredible . i ordered it my husbands birthday he just begining figure it all out . there so many great features . one best how quickly you take digital pictures . our other digital cameras lag time shots , but not this one . pictures crisp it easy even novice like me use . i highly recommend this camera if you want take digital photography next level . it one best	1
good fit , works advertised , stores lens . helps keep night dew off lens well unwanted light out during day	1
it 72mm lens hood , no vigneting , works great . must using ef28-135 outdoors	1
last battery good almost 5 years . easily rechargeable . couldn't ask more	1
there many after market batteries this camera every review indicates they not effective , this oem battery sony delivers goods , extremely long lasting power handle not only digital picture taking but all additional flash requirements	1
i'm very pleased this small unit great deal power . it compact , not heavy , adjustable power output simply spinning wheel camera left or right . addition light output , head tilted so light direct or bounced , excellent feature . getting up running this unit breeze because i am totally " brochure reading averse . " twenty years ago i photographer big equipment , but given up both . i surprised control one such small relatively inexpensive unit	1
i am very pleased this product ... shoots well all types different light conditions , even when it pitch black 430ex takes decent shotat close range ... 430ex adds deeper color warmth pictures conditions where light lacking ... i am graphic designer need great photo when i begin work 430ex helps process more clear colorful photo when shooting my rebel eos xt digital camera ...	1
it works great , there just two issues . when you lock it hot shoe , it very , very difficult unlock ( you twist wheel tighten it ) when batteries my camera low , camera flash start computer problems act very strange ( i cannon digital rebel xt ) . other than those towo issues , which comparison seem very small me , flash fantastic ! lightweight easy use	1
i using my new canon lens during 4th july rodeo redlodge montana . although i pretty far bull horse riders gate , all my photos sharp no blur al	1
i've only this lens few days i say it impressed me . it drawbacks , needs lots light somewhat heavy . i would not like carry all day , but my need it isn't problem . i couple photos display taken first day i purchased lens . it very overcast day i think they turned out reasonable weather . my test home when sun popped out outstanding . push pull adjustment i see no problem it . i think little more experience it very good purchase my budget . i know there higher quality lens but price becomes issue , when you amature hobbiest like i am . i would recommend any one who likes take wildlife photos . 5 star rating money quality it very good lens !	1
reviews this lens web mixed some showing soft results , particularly 400mm . this likely due wide variations sample lenses . i decided take chance seem gotten lucky . my copy , just received amazon ( build date oct 2005 ) produces fantastically crisp contrasty images my 20d all focal lengths 100 400 . it almost magical . images much sharper using same f-stops than those 70-200 2.8 lens 100-150mm virtually same 200mm . even wide-open 400mm this lens quite sharp . 400mm , i've compared very nice canon 400mm 5.6 prime lens , without 1.4 teleconverter . images virtually same extreme sharpness contrast if zoom stopped down just one one-third stop ( e.g. zoom 6.3 , prime 5.6 ) . 1.4 tc both lenses manually focused but produced outstanding clarity no perceivable loss quality . focus swift true this lens really works ( not hum like 70-200 2.8 ) allowing handheld shots 1/100 sec 400mm . it may canon quietly improved this lens since recent reviews seem much more positive than those few years ago . some folks don't like push-pull zoom but it works great me allows very fast composition scenes . lens same size 70-200 2.8 but seems lighter better balanced . given razor sharpness its images 100-400mm range , this seems like perfect single lens solution nature bird photography . however , it big white so it may not best candid people photography .	1
i think i may found perfect camera bag . this one comfortable wear all day , it holds my alpha 100 my kit lens , my 100-400 lens both lens hoods . my battery charger , manual , misc cables , wallet , phone , misc items such small rain jacket . it also little pocket your memory cards . best part this bag you swing it around front pull your camera out without sit it down or showing everything you bag . bag plain enough most people wouldn't know you camera all equipment goes it . which big plus women traveling alone	1
works advertised . you screw it end your lens , there you go	1
this fantastic lens . it takes crisp , rich photos , large apperature makes impressive low-light photography , includes usm technology lightening-fast focusing . since i am only serious hobbyist , i can't yet afford quality canon lens ... but 2 years i perfectly happy leave this lens camera ( 10d ) . portraits , landscapes , indoor shots no flash ... it them all ease , photos look grea t.t his lens little heavy , combined my 10d weight certainly consideration . but me it feels well-balanced camera , i like substantial feel lens-camera combination gives . if you plan use flash , remember this big lens built-in flash may not clear barrel ( especially 10d , before canon redesigned pop-up flash ) ... might want think external flash head hot shoe . there lot glass front this lens , don't forget uv filter little extra protection	1
this great lens . pictures i take very sharp alive color , brokeh excellent . i am big fan keeping shallow depth field when shooting people or animals , so f/ 2.8 helps out . also dim wedding receptions no problem even weak built flash my rebel xt . autofocus practically silent , accurate very fast . if you don't think you need f/ 2.8 , go 24-105mm f/4 . it extra 35mm telephoto end , image stabilization , lighter smaller	1
this lens worth every penny i paid it . no matter what settings , wide-open or not , end zoom range or not , you get sharp contrasty picture . however , not expect it beat prime - even cheap 50mm 1.8 ( i also own ) ( somewhat ) better sharpness contrast , visible only when enlarged though . what you pay big bucks convenience	1
used this lens deer stand while hunting , sporting events ( indoor outdoor ) concerts . fast focusing great image stabilization ( use quite bit more power , though ) . not one problem it . solid build little heft it . it bit pricey , but i chaulk up it best market . would recommend it anyone looking top shelf lens .	1
this canon lens upholds tradition fine products canon line photographic accessories . it takes very clear , sharp , hand held pictures image stabilizer capability activated . it negates necessity carrying tripod every time one wants take long telephoto shots . it should must any serious photographer wanders countryside , taking candid pictures , wants lighten load equipment carried	1
wonderful camera . very flexiable , very versitile . most wonderful creation device someone whom capable . def good buy now 30d out . i've this camera over year i still love it	1
this camera really great . i knew i liked it before , but i immediately began appreciate this camera all more when i ended up rebel xt " loaner " while my 20d repair . not xt bad camera , it just doesn't really compare 20d . 20d nice feel it ; it fairly large , which great since i somewhat large hands . features great too . image quality awesome . i don't really need go into all details , most other reviewers excellent job . let me just say it great camera worth five stars . only complaint i camera it doesn't spot metering . ability your light metering off single point interest would great - they add it 30d .	1
i bought this camera 2 months before my son born . i knew little digital slrs , but after research i found this one me . this camera well constructed durable . pictures excellent . i blown few my pictures up 11x17 without any problem . also , if you going doing any editing photos your computer , this camera would great . i would recommend purchasing newest version photoshop or photoshop elements ( when i bought mine it only came elements 2.0 3.0 already market ) . also , if you want your pictures turn out , you must purchase larger flash . onboard flash weak , leave shadows it not allow you any type " bounce " flash . whole , this best camera i ever my life it would great anyone who previous experience slr cameras .	1
aside form fact canon charges arm leg 1 dollar piece plastic , remote switch work well . it not feel very sturdy not seem nearly well built canon cameras . people big hands may little trouble using this product . overall , " must " addition anyone interested long exposures , images excellent sharpness depth field	1
rs-80n3 works advertized . cable could longer but other than i am totally pleased	1
good quality , perfect attach , but no cord avoid loose it . incredible canon forget it !!! so ... remember put it inside your pocket when you use your camera	1
it seems unfair compare this camera 10d ( or 20d or 30d ) , either favorably or unfavorably . these instruments good their own right , but hardly same league 1ds mark ii . i used all three xxd , original 1ds body well . it occurs me folks who interested shelling out over 5 grand camera already idea what they want , some them asking if they should trade their 1ds body mark ii . it them i am adressing this review . remarks , i think help those who less experience line . bear me technical jargon emphais mark i vs ii comparison . i want help buyer decide if there really reason spend this kind money . first , regarding resolution : you probably won't able tell difference mark i mark ii unless you doing studio work . 8x10 image virtually indistinguishable . most us shoot . jpg mode , we don't mess raw . if you doing 17x20 wedding portrait working uncompressed files , mark ii superior . i outdoor work , so 11.6 megapixels plenty . finallyl , quality glass makes big difference ( much more than sensor resolution ) , so if you little strapped cash , buy 5d spend difference " " series lenses , or used 1ds ( mark i ) . second : ergonomics . i like histogram mark ii better than older camera , appreciate improved burst performance , storage times . small but significant differences . battery life way better , i like . i get 700 frames out charge mark ii only 200 mark ii . thank you , canon . maybe next iteration they something black brick charger . i only hope . third : sensor noise . most ofthe high-end cameras cmos now , each time we look new generation pictures we wowed decrease sensor noise high iso . i remember we praised mark i low noise up asa 400 . uninitiated , sensor noise random firing sensor due quantum effects , manifests sparkle or random changes pixel color . it more prominent low light high asa . mark i great up asa 400 , good up 800 needs some digital filtering 1200 . mark ii really good up asa 1600 , photoshop filter good 3200 . if you shoot low light , mark ii you . fourth : color balance . i always loved warm , saturated pictures mark i gives , so don't get me wrong - better color rendition not reason sell it new model . mark ii , though , improves it gives beautiful color saturation some improvement range highligts . digital photo buffs know what i mean : if you take picture broad highlights , like sky , foreground objecst underexposed . highlights clear . set exposrue foreground , sky burnt-out white . mark ii improved this much , but it still needs some work canon . now , it helps taken large number pictures get idea how set exposure . fifth : accuracy exposure . mark i annoying tendancy overexpose stop . i got used turning down exposure 1-2 stops , exposing highlights , using photoshop correct exposure . mark ii more accurate , manual exposure close metered exposure . sixth : ff/ 1.6 business . i really don't see any reason 30d better camera because 50mm lens gives image analagous 85mm lens full frame camera . advised , though , lens evaluations depend this distinction . edge performance flair may more obvious full frame instrument . both 1ds 1ds mark ii tend challenge lenses more because they work full range lens side side through apertures . my 35-135 canon lens gave great pictures 10d , but looks washed out both 1ds . before giving 1ds mark ii bum rap less than perfect pictures , ask what lens used . seventh : price . presently , non-grey-market 1ds mark ii sells around $6899 reputable dealers . used mark i around half . i would take half star away canon pounding my pocketbook taking , but i understand mark i just same price when it released . price gradient presently would tolerable those shooting low light , or raw studio work . personally , i would buy mark i over 5d improved construction . finally , some general remarks . i would liked compare this fine camera comparable nikon . unfortunately , i cannot , because all my glass canon , i no money left mul t-t housand buck purchase nikon . maybe someone else would write review . my only beefs canon sensor dust , seems appear spontaneous generation , steep learning curve i my first use . ( plan night or two reading manual ) i guess i forgive them not putting flash it . add couple hundred price purchase 580ex . canon service terrific . if you bucks , quit complaining price get one if you serious photographer . look images dpreview.com ( long , thoughtful review there ) , fredmiranda.com - they leave you breathless . this serious instrument serious photographers far it me give it less than 5 stars my petty complaints	1
i think this best buy anyone , superfast , flexible ( 50-3200 asa ) interchangeble lenses , long last battery , all excellent , only bad thing high price but it worth it , its like ferrari , almost you want keep it home case something bad happens like stolen or damaged even some people say big size inconvinencie i personally would not like tiny camera professional photographer it woud look ridicoulous , so size good thing also , when people even dont know camera impressed stuff it	1
i've using these rebel xt since two weeks . friday i went show local bar took 600 shots medium low light conditions ( just small stage lights lighting up band ) finally killed battery after 2 1/2 hours/600 shots	1
i find canon batteries work very well . i also not mind not using aa - extra nb-2lh small easy carry around - easier than several aa ( rechargable or not )	1
i honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars . moment i got it , i delighted quality pictures ( except very dark places - which why review gets minus 1 star ) , its portability . i've dropped it , abused it , took it countless parties , countries it now full scratches bumps ( get camera case ! ) , guess what : it still works perfectly first day i got it . this little piece technology amazing , so if you're looking something affordable great picture quality ( us amateurs , course ) just go it . actually , i even took quite few gorgeous pictures it . i even love it rely it so much i won't change it even now it looks all messed up . don't think twice . just go it	1
this great product . i rather large lens it helps stabilize it so i don't blur my pictures when i'm taking pictures kids playing soccer . however , people think i'm professional photographer local newspaper when i use it grandkids ' games .	1
i very pleased amazons quick delivery my new canon monopod . monopod very easy adjust use . it ideal ridgid support you would want your camera . it even doubles great walking stick , sometime need , those long treks you make get good photo	1
... there two things you should know . first f/ 2.8 version this lens big heavy . second f/ 2.8 version this lens more versatile , therefore , more useful two choices . why f/ 2.8 more useful ? it allows you use canon outstanding extenders still sharp practical lens . 1.4 , you very , very good 98-280mm f/4 lens . 2x , you good 140-400mm f/ 5.6 lens . both cases lens autofocus -- very well 1.4 adequately 2x . use canon extenders also allows 70-200 make pretty nice close-up lens . original close focus lens maintained extenders , giving you both 280mm 400mm focal lengths focus closer than most prime lenses same focal lengths . while you use extenders f/4 version , it makes some pretty slow lenses limited applications . there not much you say this lens hasn't already said . it one sharpest zooms around look , while certainly subjective , highly appealing . i preference prime lenses over zooms but i still rank this one my sharpest lenses . there any reason choose 70-200 f/4 lens over this one ? cost aside , i see valid argument made f/4 . carrying around f/ 2.8 full camera bag no fun unless you're putting it use . since i mostly use shorter focal length prime lenses , sometimes f/ 2.8 pain neck me -- literally . unless i know i need it , i taken leaving it behind favor lighter , smaller less sharp canon 100-300 . so i see utility smaller 70-200 . maybe i talk myself into owning both . nah , that little too excessive .	1
this probably canon best value mid/long zoom . i got this same day i purchased my 30d ... ef-s 10-22 ef 24-70 2.8 . talk pleased ! no regrets whatsoever . this lens just screams quality . images just pop out you . if you're considering f/4 model ... take hard look this one . add hood ( cha-ching ) ( yikes ) $100+ tripod ring value this lens really shows . it bit larger heavier but look what you gain ! if you're one those considers sweet spot lens stopped down step or two just look where puts you f/4 compared this one . focus speed nothing short " holy mackerel that fast ! " sure , you could spend few more bucks get version ... but frankly , me least , if it important i'll using tripod anyway . hmmm , just took shakes out equation . all all , great lens decent price	1
i got this cord mainly macro work so i could use long macro lenses my flash without deal lens shadow picture . it also very nice able control direction lighting placing flash above , below , or beside subject . red eye also almost entirely reduced moving flash further away camera body , so this cord helpful portrait work . it could little longer , but longer it gets more difficult it would pack it small spaces , so all-in-all i think they pretty good job . it works fine , if you want all your flash functionally , but don't want it hotshoe , this good choice	1
there not much say this , since there no other alternatives me . simply stated , i went lowest price i could find .	1
i use this all time my son soccer games get great shots . it little bigger side , but isn't too heavy image stabilization really helps out	1
this great lens used almost everything . it great if you only want take one lens you . pictures very sharp color good	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
i started battery grip initially wanting double battery availability . used 35mm hand strap already realizing value stability such strap , this my second attraction purchase battery grip last but not all least , ability use shoot grip itself , allowing full ease rotation camera . though i never used battery magazine allows use aa batteries , it offers backup should canon batteries need charging i am heat shooting . i always travel my charge four aa batteries . i would recommend this grip standard accessory eos-20d eos 30-d . one thought consider once camera it increases overall height creating challanges some camera cases .	1
i just attached my battery grip my 300d first time today , difference amazing . i already extra battery pack , so i charged them both up slid them right away . added weight very nice addition 300d small body , i already see improvement my ability hold camera still . it also makes camera feel much sturdier . i seen few reviews complain fitting . i not problem . connection seemless me , there no shimmy what-so-ever when i 70-300 lens attached camera tripod . so maybe this accessory optimized xt ? i love extra shutter button well , it makes taking picture portrait orientation extremely comfortable easy . buttom almost exactly same actual shutter camera well , which makes it easy go button button . after reading all hype this accessory , i forced myself buy it , i not dissapointed ! i recommend it anyone using xt . buy it now or else	1
i just upgraded 20d , speed just blows 20d out way !! image quality runs same both cameras since they're both 8.2 mp , but how camera gets you those images simply amazing . fastest shutter out there , low noise , consistent color , spot metering , multiple spot metering , weather sealing , list goes !! this camera demands best glass , but you won't sorry . if your serious photography any field , this camera won't disappoint !! bit pricey , but believe me , it worth every penny !!!! see some my work ( ...	1
this tool transforms my drebel xt tiny little viewfinder into usable one . it 1.25 setting it shows clear picture 100% coverage what viewfinder shows . 2.5 , coverage much less but setting very handy very critical manual focussing jobs . remember set your camera diopter it default factory setting . otherwise , flipping angle finder 1.25 2.5 magnification requires re-adjustment finder diopter . big advantage this little device it gives you freedom try exciting angles ( hey , they don't call it angle finder nothing ) without breaking your neck . only minor downside initial learning curve getting adjusted image shown finder .	1
just use this protect lens . good cheap alternative scratched lens	1
yes , it overpriced , just like any specialty item . yes , screw attachment bottom camera useless . but when you need fast recycle times or hundreds flashes go , cp-e3 invaluable . you strap case light stand or flash bracket , coiled cord length adequate these uses . i use elegantly compact really right stuff flash bracket which no place attach cp-e3 , so battery back without its case slips into my shirt or pants pocket . case could also strapped your bel t.t he unit little weighty 8 rechargeable aa batteries aboard , i'd hate see how many pieces this plastic gizmo would break into if i dropped it hard surface . top tunnel strap hang it something , strap should included . i made loop some hiking boot shoelaces ( which i also make zipper pulls ) i hang it knob light stand when shooting studio set-up . without short recycle times cp-e3 allows , my 580ex flash would gotten only one shot my daughter bowing after playing her piece piano recital . instead , i got three . decide yourself how important kind thing	1
i bought this because i needed top recycle speed my 550ex flash unit without spending huge bundle . i shoot karate demos my eos rebel digital , lots fast action rather large space ( meaning many full power flashes ) . digital rebel set iso800 mode flash set +1 stop exposure i adequately cover action basketball court sized gymnasium . using this battery pack 2000mah aa sized batteries ( 6.50 set 4 walmart ) i've taken over 400 pictures no slow down cycle speed . this particular pack uses 8 aa cells compatible lithium ion cells . older version this unit used 6 cells i believe , not compatible lithium ion batteries . unit very simple . box light it , space strap ( though none included ) slide out battery tray locking button course connector coiled cord hooks into side flash unit . i'm sure they it reasons resistance , but cord kinda short , thus limiting you where you hang battery package . if your tripod socket free they include screw designed mount battery package bottom camera ( kinda useless if you ask me ) . battery box comes fairly nice padded nylon case includes velcro strap , this what i use hang battery package camera or bag strap it works fine . eventually i'll get around finding something i use strap worry me less ( 8 batteries this thing it bit heavy trusted velcro if you ask me ) . unit works way it intended but i think price exhorbitant hunk plastic , price should half what it . if you can't go all-out buy top end rechargeable battery or true professional ( what they used call 512 ) battery package then this enough most us	1
my first lens . very sharp solid build . canon dr amazon gc , you get it lower $400 !!	1
like canon ef 17-40 f4l usm , this it sister $100 cheaper boot ! excellent images f4 ! outstanding images f9 . lightweight combination canon 5d . even lighter more compact combination canon digital rebel t.t he only gripe i purchase optional expensive tripod collar ring . ring add bit noticeable weight . since i am not steady shooter , i upgrading canon ef 70-200 f4l usm when it available november this year . least tripod collar ring should fit newer weathersealed lens .	1
this lens i use most often . it unbeatable portraits low-light photos indoors etc . it very sharp relatively light small . i also found it useful aerial photography . i used 50 mm 1.8 but upgraded because i like extra low-light power 1.4 ( which i often use ) one-touch usm manual focus distance scale ( which just nice-to-have ) . said , 1.8 great lens too	1
when i worked photojournalist many years ago , 50mm " standard " lens it came closest real world perspective , especially street photography . no longer always true because field-of-view crop many cameras . canon popular digital rebel its successors , example , 1.6 view turns 50mm lens into 80mm lens . 1d mark ii 1.3 view makes it 65mm lens . so , if you're looking standard lens today , 35mm probably closer mark those cameras . canon couple options there - 35 f/ 1.4 great expensive 35 f/2 good value $250 . if you're still looking 50mm , however , there now four options canon : 50/ 1.2 , 50/ 1.4 , 50/ 1.8 50/ 2.5 . here pros cons each : 50/ 1.2 newest , fastest most expensive $ 1,600 . it " " lens , which means it more durably constructed than any others . image quality cut above all others , especially wider apertures . if money no object , you'll probably want this one . but most rest us ask question whether it 5x better than 1.4.50 / 1.4 maligned some softness its images f/ 1.4 , but me its good , compact , low-light lens terrific price ($325 ) . lens gets sharp quickly you stop it down . it sharp f/2 very sharp f/ 2.8 good contrast colors . 50/ 1.8 step down 1.4 speed , image quality , build quality smoothness noise its autofocus . but it big step up value - decent lens $80 . if you're just getting into digital photography , this great lens learn until you get better feel lenses you want/need . 50/ 2.5 - this macro lens , although you use it general photography , too . i wouldn't recommend it . if you're doing macro photography , spend little more 100/ 2.8 , which sharper lens gives you more subject distance . if you're looking standard lens , you'll appreciate wider aperture 1.4 . all said , 50mm canon lenses , i think 50/ 1.4 still offers best mix image quality value .	1
this works just described . long flash i-red beams see eachother it works fine ... but radio controlled flash much better	1
i chance compare it tokina glass . canon better contrast better distortion , same or even slightly worse sharpness , complete looser build quality . if you ok 12mm - get tokina	1
exceptional portrait lens both digital film , nikkor 85mm f/ 1.8 usably sharp wide open tack sharp time you stop down even just bit . relatively small very light , it feels just right my hand . steve mccurry one my favorite photographers i happy discover many his great shots taken this lens . also , if you shoot manual focus body like f3 , you'll like solid but smooth feel focus ring . 85mm comes metal , screw-on hood . my preference plastic bayonet mounts , but i find i don't need hood often since this lens doesn't tend flare . two minor complaints this lens : first , bokeh not exceptional . that ok ; i'm not bokeh hound . but when i see creamy out focus specular highlights 85mm f/ 1.4 produces , sometimes i dream spending extra money . second , i wish it af-s . but even without af-s , it focuses faster than you'd expect . finally , construction solid . i've used it heavily two years deserts , jungles , glaciers ( ok , less glamorous places like around apartment ) it still looks brand new . short , my favorite lens . absolutely worth every penny	1
this same charger came my digital rebel , however , i like charge two batteries time . so , i bought second charger place them side side power strip . prongs outlet fold over into back charger making charger very compact , flat easy take you . it nice charger without long cords fuss .	1
i am thrilled this lens capabilities pictures it . i test shot corner window determine if it would good my insect shots i like so well . well , it great it came but i found i wanted 1/1 capability so i bought add-on converter am thrilled added both these necessary items my set-up . i like nature photography best like use my off summer days hiking finding photographs take perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles subjects what i like specialize . this lens greatly enhance your experience ' little world ' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away . i built diffuser using ping-pong ball over flash so lighting would work better . ( works great , btw ) . usual , it great canon glass trick	1
first i not this lens yet but i am buying it . it reportedly excellent lens very little distortion edges ( which why i'm buying it ) . i update this review after i lens , however , i feel people should warned big error well received review because it only lead frustration . not listen john kwok suggestion buy canon 60mm macro lens unless you you own 20d , 300d , or 350d/rebel xt . lens ef-s lens september , 2005 it only fit those cameras - it not optimized all canon dslr he states . other hand , 50mm macro here fit all canon 35mm film cameras all digital slr .	1
i love this camera . it my second canon , 7mp , best value money i've seen . i took it france this summer loved fact i could recharge battery overnight while my friends constantly changing their batteries ( searching places buy them ! ) . my favorite option " scene " button . i don't think i'll ever try " underwater " option , but " night shot " " inside shot " work fantastically . it also seems though you take movies until card or battery fail - which huge improvement over my older canon . unlike lot newer cameras , this one viewfinder . friend mine nikon no viewfinder it extremely hard use bright sunshine . i carried my camera my purse without case few days ago new orleans without problem - it worked like charm . i would recommend this camera anyone who wants easy-to-use model produces fabulous results .	1
it working well , it sturdy . i dropped ground when playing frisby , but nothing happened	1
first amazon thanks great service delivering our item . it works fantastic . we very satisfied it .	1
i don't much stuff , but fits all my dslr gadgets plus my camcorder . fits - my canon xti my canon 50 mm attached . - my kit lens- my new canon 70-300 is- my panasonic video cam- minor accessories ( extra batteries , cables , memory cards , etc)there separators velcros inside , so you configure bag however you want i t.t he only issue i this bag i wan't able configure it store my xti my 70-300 attached	1
this camera bag just i expected . what written description fits it perfectly . nice bag ! great response time delivery . thanks	1
jim . made great review ..... i just wanted let you know i agree . this great . it very light weight . only reason why i gave it 4 stars you need zoom bit or else you get burnout effect ( circle where corners dark because it getting inside lens ) . annoying , forces you remove extender when you want take closer photos . distance though , it great . pictures come out great . i highly recommend this ..... i would given it 4.5 stars if it option	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile .	1
i bought this hood canon 85mmf 1.8 lens , one incredible lens . years ago i went lecture ernst wilde , mr . hasseblad himself , where he showed difference lens hood would make hasseblad lens . since then i always used them faithfully every lens i own . longer lens , more efective lens hood if it specifically designed lens . this hood canon their medium telephoto lenses , 85f 1.8 , 100usm macro , 135mmf 2.8 lenses . hood protect your lens dust , scratches , damage , while same time preserving maximum contrast your lens deliver . this differs filter , take away inherit lens sharpness contrast . analogy wearing baseball cap which improve your vision protect your eyes cataracts , while not distorting your vision like sunglasses	1
this product works really well , price great . i am always pleased quality kodak	1
kodak made printing pictues simple 123 . paper cartridge snaps place quite easily . it removed quickly stored out way because paper protected its own tray convenient lid . this high quality paper protective coating applied photo give it many years durability . i thought price competative other methods printing photo paper	1
now , this isn't fastest card market . but it solid , reliable card . camera itself bottle kneck , typically not this card . however , if you using canon dslr recent flavor , i would check if it needs rma'd . known quantity these cards proven lose images . scary . however , i've not experienced mysterious loss images my card or rebel xt . i've only ever pushed cards speed limits my pd70x , definately not my rebel xt	1
i would not able imagine shooting without sb-800 , it just so integral my photography . my only gripe ttl preflashes which cause some people blink half-blink time main flash goes off . but you easily get around this using fv lock . fill flash perhaps most excellent function sb-800 . i usually stop it down - 1.3 ev - 1.7 ev get imperceptable results	1
bought it together d50 , 6 month ago . simply best choice digital nikon slr , superior compared high-end flashes analog nikon cameras . within range up 60feet this flash brighten very smooth , no red eyes , press focus perfectly . but you need 5th battery , you better spent money high-end batteries , don't use " consumer-type " rechargeable ones . they last very short time only , not enough fill 1gb card !	1
just bought my first slr ( d50 ) my first external flash ( sb-800 af ) . i didn't know what expect , but i amazed ! i could take flash into very dark ( mostly candle lit ) large ( 40'x65 ' ) room take shot looked like daylight . far speed , its amazing - i shoot off 12 shots continuous mode my camera flash keep up ( sometimes it miss shot or two - still trying figure one out ) . so far , i couldn't more pleased	1
this flash working great me . it amazing recycle time . i able easily fire off multiple shots indoors low light without missing beat . i also used it completely dark room , all worked great . i don't like locks bounce head , it necessary press release side prior tilting . just minor annoyance	1
camera handles very well - it light drives my zoom lens 18-55mm lens beautifully . i get professional photographs use it all day without suffering heavy weight , which it not . view finder excellent readout back camera extremely helpful , showing photos they taken - zoom back screen , which immediately gives me idea photo i want use my books . i say this outstanding lens camera .	1
this lens outstanding . speed sharpness top-notch . i use this lens wide array situations it always delivered impressive results . best lens it class reasonable price . it well built , sturdy , not so heavy so it relatively easy carry around . canon really impressed me this lens . i use it my eos system ( traditional digital cameras ) .	1
i bought this camera gift my 16 yr old daughter who takes lots fun pictures her friends . her photos great quality . this dependable camera , takes abuse teenager gives it . i love it all those reasons besides great pics	1
time this writing , there something wrong product shot amazon site : it makes lens look much shorter than it reality . it not large or heavy lens all , but it not _that_ short . i've mine ( part 20d kit ) year , during which i've taken maybe 4000 frames or so particular lens . lens still appears solid it day 1 , so no complaints departmen t.t he image stabilization ( ) feature works quite well surprisingly silent ( far more so than system ef 70-300mm ) . said , good fraction focal length range , relatively minor ( but still useful ) benefit this lens . autofocus ( af ) speed okay : better than kit lens came original digital rebel i used own , but not fast some other lenses i ( all non-l ) . af accuracy fine my copy . optically , my concern primarily sharpness . department , lens seems only marginally better than 18-55mm kit lens came original digital rebel ( which bought close $100 , i believe ) . it often worth turning off improve things , ironically . still , it not awful . i haven't found vignetting , distortion , flare , aberrations significant hindrances . part , probably due workflow includes dxo pro images i care . overall , i think this still pretty good choice lens keep default canon ef-s camera ( 30d , 20d , or digital rebel variant ) . optical performance over lower-end ef-s 18-55mm lens not _that_ great , but feature set may justify premium . higher end ef-s 17-55/ 2.8 alternative if you're willing double your investment change lenses get longer focal range : its imaging quality larger aperture certainly desirable . tamron sigma some offerings this range too , but i'm not all familiar them	1
i got this lens replace kit lens came my canon eos 30d . this lens definitely more " substantial " lens than kit lens . even though outer housing plastic , it metal mount seems very durable sturdy . really helps improve image quality induced my unsteady hand . usm very fast quiet . i read accounts this lens not able lock , but i not any issues it varying ( including low ) lighting conditions . i know lens supports ftm focus , but i not tried it yet . i like focal length range this lens . 17mm even 1.6 multiplier , angle very wide . only drawback this lens me 17mm there significant barrel distortion . my test shots my next shot 24mm distortion completely gone this focal length . it not showstopper though since it easily corrected photoshop . all lenses i plan get , ( sigma 30mm 1.4 , canon ef 50mm 1.8 ii , canon ef 70-300mm usm ) , this most likely lens i keep camera most time , using others opportunities warrant	1
i bought 2 these carry camera support suspended over treadmill filming above . i love fact they extend 70 " . they very sturdy hook central post i could hang sandbag additional support . furthermore , support beams each leg central post attached central ring tighten change size base support measured distance legs tripod . this extremely helpful when you limited floor space tight or cramped corners . addition sandbags , this narrow base support still quite stable . additional bubble levels stand enormously helpful rough terrain . locking mechanims legs plastic , however thus not very good outdoor , dusty conditions . they very much like samsonite 3751 same camera release mechanism , locking legs , bubble levels , extendable center post , changeable size base suppor t--t he differences : cheaper , greater extension , hook center post , carrying case	1
i needed this tripod use my 20x50 binoculars since least movement 20x magnification causes subject wind up outside viewing field . this tripod works well use . it sturdy , lots features reasonably priced . however , if you wish use tripod binoculars , right angle adapter needed . i found one ebay few dollars .	1
i little hesitant purchase this tripod because low price . last cheap tripod i bought lightweight wobbly . i am very pleased performance this tripod . i wasn't expecting bogen type quality , but its good enough . it lightweight , surprisingly sturdy . i would recommend this tripod friend	1
we traded up original rebel xti . this first add-on we purchased great ! battery grip adds some balance overall sturdy-feeling rebel ... especially , slightly smaller xt xti bodies . good stuff , no regrets	1
i read rave reviews opteka battery grip manufactured same specs canon grip but fraction price , so i knew i couldn't go wrong it . it came two 3rd party batteries well only $20 more , so what i lose ? let me start off saying i experience 3rd party batteries they usually waste money they horrible performance standpoint . not these however , i taken few hundred pictures 20% flash battery meter still full . great value overall . grip really balance out small size rebel xt always stays my camera . it add considerable weight camera however , but nothing overbearing	1
i previously owned kodak easy share died while i vacation . i loved easy learn use features camera so i wanted camera easy non-professional use . this little camera great ! i've it few months now love pictures ! it very easy use super small which makes it easy throw my purse take anywhere . pictures crisp clear battery lasts forever . my old kodak used take real aa batteries i thought camera its own little rechargeable battery might strange but it actually much easier lasts way longer than aa my old kodak . lcd screen huge makes it very easy review photos . just one little click go review back taking photos . only two downfalls i've found so far little setting dial moves easily its own so you always check it before taking picture or it might some strange setting or video . other thing i haven't able figure out if there way delete all photos camera after you upload them - i've delete them one one which slow process . other than those two little things this camera wonderful ! highly recommended	1
this outstanding camera it size . easy use , easy carry produces great pictures . would recommend anyone who ready give up film go digital	1
when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
i digital cameras 5 years still own olympus 5 megapixel , casio 7 megapixel . seems like megamixels alone just don't cut it me . i read rebel xt magazine looked up user reviews here amazon . i decided go buy one though i am really novice , i am extremely impressed . i never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors point shoot . i started basic settings love results . i am slowly progressing more advanced settings am getting better everyday . even novice who just wants stunning photography amazed this camera . i also bought tamron 75-300 autofocus zoom lens ( look it here amazon.com ) after lots practice , able take some great pictures . i brother uk who also into digital photography , after seeing some ( full reso ) photos i sent him , he rushed out bought xti ( called eos 400d across pond)and amazed it . i still lot learn but really cannot fault this camera . included software also excellent . record , some reviews seem think it too small hold , i big hands don't any problems all . i admit though this first slr i ever owned . i still keep point shoot keep my travel bag spontaneous photography but i am love my rebel xt !! this camera costs quite chunk change but i think it well worth it i recommend it everyone	1
i've my d70s year now , haven't regretted it second . controls laid out logically , everything hand . dual control wheels make adjustments fast accurate . i personally love optional grid overlay , i no excuses horizons aren't horizontal . wireless flash system great , though you buy sb-600 or sb-800 get full benefit . this camera bigger heavier than d50 d80 , which my opinion positive thing .	1
great affordable camera , takes very nice pictures .	1
bought p880 month ago . i am sem-pro outdoor adventure photographer i use nikon 35mm film equipment most part . i shoot slide film my f90s nikon . i 5mp kodak digital camera but wanted upgrade better digital camera but i could not justify buying nikon d50 or d70s they only 6mp . i didn't want drop 2 grand d200 . so i looked mid-range camera lines . after doing much research , i decided buy this camera . so far i am happy i . i taken it hiking several times , enough i know its good camera but course its toy compared pro nikon film cameras . but i knew when i bought it . i wanted good camera take lots " documentary " , " fun " " travel " shots . really powerful stuff i still shoot slide film . but its too expensive shoot extensively!here my initial impressions based perspective outdoor photosgrapher : good : 1 ) fairly easy hold its tall actual grip . 2 ) lightweight ( but course expense impact resistance i'm sure ... ) 3 ) great set manual controls ! this best part . autobracket good interval timer which great self-potraits . you walk far away camera get yourself shot ( great solo hikers ) . 4 ) large 2.5 " lcd makes it easy check out your photos5 ) image quality seems pretty good ( although not comparable high-res . scan slide ) . 6 ) manual zoom great ! much better than power zooms almost all other cameras . 7 ) 24mm focal length simply amazing ! great landscapes outdoor adventure shots . 8 ) battery life great . shot 250 or so pics full charge included lot playing around menus , reviewing photos , etc . i just boughta second kodak battery amazon $16 ! 9 ) built flash pretty powerful you add shoe mount unit well . 10 ) 8mp resolution price 6mp camera . not so good : 1 ) seems write card pretty slowly . definately not action shots ! maybe this would improve if i bought faster sd card . 2 ) " toggle " button back navigating through menues worries me . seems like it could break someday . i am gentle it . wish they would create more durable feeling toggle . 3 ) lcd viewfinder hard see bright sunny day . this where film camera way better . optical viewfinders cannot beat . 4 ) screen manual focus no good all . better just focus your eyes . 5 ) wish they would made handgrip little grippier adding rubber stip or like . little slippery hands ( always use neck strap ! )in all i highly recommend this camera . if they improve upon some items which i some critisism , i would easily give this camera perfect review !! good luck your purchas	1
new nikon en-el3e battery slight update nikon en-el3 provided earlier dslr models such d70 . it adds contact allows new cameras determine how much charge left battery . battery grey distinguish it black en-el3 . en-el3e backwards compatible en-el3 : you put it your d70 or d50 . reverse not true . number pictures battery gives you depends lot factors , including shooting style , lcd usage , course , camera . ( 2.5 " lcd d200 use up battery much quicker than smaller d70 . ) it sufficient day shooting . unless you using d200 some professional capacity , which case , you'll probably investing least one backup battery	1
this my first very expensive entry into digit slr photography . i used canon point shoot digital camera previously . i avoiding dslr because i used rarely use my eos film slr . convienience point shoot experience overwhelming . unfortunately so it limitations . so back i came , only choice though expensive eos 5d it full frame sensor ! pain reduced double rebates . wow ! this revelation ! beautifull images , lot control . i notice af not fast my old elan iie . i also disappointed price there lack weather sealing . i am not happy canon this , but i really appreciate them making full frame sensor difficult marketable slot far their line up concerned . this camera also needs prime or lenses , because sensor reveal inadequacies inferior lenses . this add cos t.t his exceptional photographic tool i hope use improve my skill i explore all it capabilities	1
after 3 decades nikon 35mm film ' loyalist ' , co-worker let me test drive his canon 5d , canon ef 16-35mm 2.8 usm sandisk extreme iii 2 gb card . viewing images his lcd computer screen helped me decide sell almost everything nikon ( i kept their sb-800 flash wireless slave setups ) switch established dslr leader , canon . finally , no more heavy bulky nikon f5 pay wait film processing ! no more scanning negatives hours each night!i've owned 5d , canon ef 17-40mm f4l usm , canon ef 70-200mm f4l usm tripod collar canon speedlite 580ex 3 months taken over thousand raw large jpeg images iso ranging 50 3200 . ( note : 4 weeks ago , backup canon digital rebel xt black body added 70-200 . ) 5d image quality stunned every person i given 4 " 6 " 8.5 " x11 " colour monochrome images . credit must given canon digital photo professional ( dpp ) raw processing software , canon i9900 bubblejet printer , canon paper canon ink . i rarely use adobe photoshop cs2 anymore because dpp quick-to-use tools . above 5d any one lenses flash fits nicely into tamrac velocity 7 bag . larger velocity 9 bag fit entire 2 body lenses flash ki t.t he only negative camera closed compact flash card gate moves slightly it hinge giving body less than solid feel . digital rebel xt not this issue therefore feels more solid . built-in flash would nice but not absolutely necessary . unlike superb nikon sb-800 , canon 580ex bit chunky but it job wonderfully . low noise images iso above 800 easily removed dpp or photoshop . photoshop goes step further removing colour artefacts which lowers saturation image . meaning saturation would increased after noise removal . bottom line : if you believe it costs canon more manufacturer full-frame cmos image sensor don't mind spending several months salary 5d , go it ! also , choose your lenses carefully . canon lenses go well 5d .	1
while 5d may less expensive than so-called professional grade , camera more oriented toward pro end than 20d ( or 30d ) fewer dial settings but more capability . others covered some other areas , so i'll try avoid repetition . full frame makes great deal difference me . i like print large images i like use or other higher end canon lenses ( couple knockoffs ) . there no tradeoff weight consequence or compactness . truth i prefer recent glass isn't computed smaller sensor . i liked 20d , lot , most my gear carries over 5d . i now three cameras take same card battery . 5d if anything feels looks more rugged 20d while very compact . but pictures ? great . 20d first rate camera 8.2 its ability use all canon lenses , plus ef-s smaller digital image . one person cited slowness over 20d . i won't disagree , but it isn't big deal me . i typically use drive bracketing fly , but almost never anything just fast sequence , e.g. sports . i've owned motorr drives going back my days pro 60s 70s they their uses . esssential sometimes . but they like autofocus . occasion , you need manual . whenever possible , i prefer single shot or occasion , three shot burst . i find there less chance missing what i'm shooting . " decisive moment " too often falls frames motor driving . but that everyone taste . i really am impressed camera tried it , look forward trip it , trusty 20d second .	1
price , this excellent lens . aps sized sensor it equivalent 480mm long end . some complain it slow lense since max aperture full zoom 5.6 just means you can't use it low light expect great results . if you want fast lense length , however , prepared pay lot money . usm it focuses very fast . works well outdoor sports . my rating based what you get money . course it not good glass but it way less money	1
i just begun my interest photography this first zoom lense i ever bought . lense provided all i could ever ask . i just got back zoo kids photographes excellent	1
i bought this monopod after reading reviews here . it really light-weighted . i used it take pictures dance performace where tripod not possible . i able use slow shutter got great images . cons : i saw pro ( i knew he runs studio ) using similar monopod which black . so my only complain its non-black color . well i am not pro anyway .	1
this cable very essential need me upload my photos computer . i very fortunate find it amazon.co	1
this essential part digital picture taking . can't download pictures your kodak camera onto computer without it . it should come standard your camera purchase , but if you misplaced yours , this one get . arrived promptly ordered value great	1
why use case when this one built specifically this camera ? i like it , it sleek belt-mountable . also enough padding so you throw it backpack , suitcase , etc	1
after reviewing my options purchase my new canon a540 we chose this case i'm glad i ! nice snug fit camera , extra compartments memory card batteries , no need strap , you already provided one camera .	1
i've this camera three years . i bought it new , when it cutting edge very expensive . i put 128mb cf card it . first , i say i never slightest problem this camera or software . i've probably taken upwards 5000 pictures it , it all over country . software installed windows 95 , 98 , 2000 xp i haven't any problems it . camera solid , performs well , takes good pictures , battery lasts pretty long if you disable lcd viewfinder . if battery life big deal , one could purchase second battery rotate . all said , i am little disappointed quality pictures camera . they razor sharp , color balance perfect , focus great . when taking pictures people , however , it shows every flaw subject skin . scratches , oil , freckles magnified come out looking horrific . it requires extensive photoshopping fix flaws . other cameras taking pics same subjects turn out looking much better . i also say it takes very long moment camera its digital image processing time you press button when camera actually takes picture . time shot taken , something ( especially squirmy child or sports play ) invariably moved it not exact picture you wanted . i'm going buy real single-lens reflex ( slr ) take baby pictures , but i'll keep this travel camera	1
if you're professional photographer , you probably ignore this review . but then you probably won't thinking buying this lens anyway , you'll off purchase nice series . however , if - like me - you just happen nice canon digital rebel camera ( or equivalent ) enjoy taking decent pictures , this lens probably work out very well you . i've taken well over 1000 pictures it couple weeks , it performed very much expected . price , it perfect go-everywhere lens . few main points . okay , it not best image quality . even low/medium iso it seems little grainy its not sharp some more expensive canon lenses . it struggles indoors unless you good flash unit , but well-lit outdoor shoots it works very well . course , it would nice nice series , but if you can't afford then this very good value lens . not real professionals , but great if you don't take things too seriously just want bit more zoom - , let face it , who doesn't want but more zoom	1
i am railfan , very large range zoom important . shooting fly distant bridge shot closeup coming around bend . focuses quickly too . i canon 10d i hate changing lenses because it gets dust inside camera . this 28-200mm very practical my hobby , gets used waterfall other outdoor scenery too . one note interest , it hard get super-sharp background details this lens , compared any lenses or series lenses , ( buddy i shot same closeup shot ore dock way background dock details looked lot sharper his 28-135 lens ) . same camera , same settings . closeup focused object looked great both , just when looking out-of-focus objects , lenses seemed better . this lens worth price my opinion , superb amateurs hobby-photographers like myself . but those looking touch more distant details out focused field , 28-135 usm lens canon seems little step ahead this . series lenses , course , league their own	1
portraits sporting events , this wonderful multi-purpose lens . prior purchasing lens , i asked buddy mine ( photographer philadelphia flyers , nhl hockey team long time canon user ) if this quality lens . he told me go it it best buy money distortion spherical abberation extremely minimal this lens . truth told , i've never seen ef lens i didn't like	1
let face it . this great lens . but , i want warn you adorama . i highly recommend you choose better vendor . adorama slow . they don't respond emails . they took week ship my lens when they said it stock . their customer service non-existen t.t heir prices no better than anyone else . almost every time i've ordered them they contacted me try sell me more stuff . ( which further delays shipping)a totally unprofessional organization . i one never order them again . good luck if you	1
great using tripod , now you pictures too	1
this camera excellent one !! really when you compare its price its results level quality you get you know why this best its category , i'm getting very professional results using it lot styles .. highly recommended	1
i already digital rebel able sell it co-worker use proceeds my new rebel xt . faster , lighter , better . simple review . it took everything great my digital rebel made it better . some complain it feels " too light " ... ok ... it that your thing . me , it still solid pictures speak themselves . now , addition 10 mp rebel xt , i'll bet original xt purchased even better price . no downsides i think ..	1
best camera i ever owned . easy use even all features . don't afraid buy this one	1
i bought this battery replacement old canon bp511a . it lasted couple months before it started not taking charge . complete waste money	-1
super lightweight , sharp wide open , short minimum focus distance , fast af . decent bokeh . ability take pictures very low light , super cheap when compared it 35mm 1.4 $1000+ brother 1.6 digital its normal lens see some shots : http://www.pbase.com/2bruce/gillin	1
this delivered so fast it unbelievable . they sent exactly what pictured it works perfectly	1
nothing wrong this battery . personally i would prefer my camera use aa but battery life lithium ion batteries pretty good . no complaints here except price . but necessity made me purchase second one , not because my other one died , just cuz sometimes i need spare	1
battery works great , shipping amazon took too long . i purchased other items same day other retailers they delivered 5 days sooner than amazon item	1
i bought this my nikon d70 digital slr 18-70mm nikkor lens . it works great except lens cap not work polarizer filter . it works other three filters : nd4 , nd8 , uv . price still beats buying four filters individually . i like case also	1
i compared lot bags use my new nikon d50 . i wanted bag versatile could carried hikes . lowepro slingshot definitely bag my camera ! plenty room couple lens , battery charger , other small items .	1
this fit my olympus e500 great . i recently took overseas trip this bag great traveling go trips . weatherproof cover really came handy few time when it started rain unexpectly . only thing bit odd strap you wear around your body . it comes up chest odd angle , my husband didn't problem it but i . so maybe thats just girl thing .... :) most times i didn't use extra strap , just threw it over one shoulder went . bag held 2 lenses , extra battery , charger , i room keys , wallet few little personal odds ends . my friend so impressed it , he buying one today . some one asked if they attach tripod bag . there aren't really any extra loops outside bag . stadard tripod won't fit insidde . you would rig something up outside yourself . imo i don't it would work very well but you try .	1
i love this remote . i find it very convenient take self portraits night time long exposure shots . unfortunately i lost remote during my trip smokies still no clue how where - might slipped my pocket hurry . i ordered second one now . it so tiny you not feel weight or volume your pocket or camera bag . i wish it strap/thread or hole so it attached key chain or camera or etc .	1
this wonderful filter . clean your front element , place this filter it , now you never think it again . thread fit very good both ends it . canon 67mm cap fits front this filter perfectly . there even slight raised metal lip so cap doesn't sit against filter glass . well engineered , worth money	1
this my first review here . bought marine pack houseboat trip my sony dsc-n1 camera . it very solid feels great . somehow i mistakenly thought before obtaining it touchscreen could still used when camera installed . though that not accurate , good number other functionality retained ( you switch movie/camera/review modes , zoom , etc . ) . it worked very well trip , it took fantastic photos . we even took several movies going down water slides diving into water ( which isn't suggested manuals ) but still everything turned out perfectly . all all , i'd easily recommend this unit	1
i gave this camera my husband his birthday . it first digital camera we owned though my college age son his third one - all canon digital elphs . this such great little gadget - it smaller than pack cigarettes , big screen which view your photo(s ) , easy learn use , great taking trips - long you remember keep wrist strap your wrist while you using it so it doesn't drop break . i also purchased small canon digital printer which great us take our aging parents , take photos , print them immediately leave them our parents enjoy immediately . every canon product we own not disappointed us this little camera no exception !	1
it great compact camera good zoom . i now leave larger lens my nikon dx 70 use this closer shots . you need try different settings make sure you get color you want . i really like it most general quick shots , carry it wth me most time	1
it doesn't get any better this price point . excellent build quality , very easy use , intuitive . optics simply brilliant kit lense ( 135mm ) . went canon rebel film slr which i loved , but when i tried move into xti , there just no comparison xti d80 . you could immediately feel difference quality functionality . auto-clean feature absolute marketing crap canon . cmos shakes off dust , but then where dust go ? bologna feature , not mention flash nearly knocks your eye out when it pops up canon xti . d80 blows it away , it price there nothing out there better . if your market this price point , or relatively close , just go it . you not regret this purchase .	1
this camera awesome ! i upgraded my d50 better sensor more mp . wow - am i amazed increase quality . say goodbye digital look . extras lot fun i've only begun play . b/w various filters name one . very worth money	1
canon g6 great camera . i upgraded canon powershot a80 g6 . a80 showed me canon makes good camera , but lacking few features i really wanted . me , this camera perfect collection compromises . i want small camera family snapshots , that easy use . i want large , capable camera art work like portraits landscape , action shots like sports recreation . when i'm vacation , want some snaps kids goofing around or dinner or something , i don't need camera makes me jump through hoops get decent shot , i just want point shoot . full auto , or aperature priority , or shutter speed priority , pictures usually sharp crisp . set image size one medium or small settings you use high speed multi-shot feature get series action shots guarantee you'll get least few good ones . i no qualms setting this camera auto , handing this camera person little or no photgraphic experience , letting them click away . it easy enough learn most folks taking nice pictures less than hour , pros taking great pictures no time all . other hand , lot work i very artistic , involves using manual settings . when going perfect picture , it often necessary adjust focus , aperature , shutter speed get exact picture you want . this camera manual focus , feature i sorely missed my older powershot a80 . thing bothers me most other cameras , you wade through bewilderingly large collection menu options make smallest changes . while i understand using layer or two menus things like basic settings ( time , format cf card ) i can't see it something basic film speed or white balance . which why i love this camera . following items one button away : flash flash output levelmulti-imagetime delay photoautofocus areamacro modemanual focuswhite balancezoom / outfilm speed ( 50 400)picture mode ( auto , manual , manual preset 1 2 , av , tv , portratit , landscape , backlit , panorama , movie)my favorite things this camera : battery life excellent . i bought spare battery , but i've never actually use one came it less than day . it charges fast too . picture quality : larger lens allows better pictures low light conditions , it very clear . large ccd allows you get pictures large enough resolution print out fairly large copies them look very good . ergonomic . this very comfortable camera hold long time . it not quite same range some much more expensive units , but i've never gotten tired holding it . plus , all buttons you need hit while running it right there under your fingertips . scroll wheel under your right index finger very intuitive operate . push it change modes , roll it change settings . fold out screen allows you take pictures odd angles without ever lay down your back picture . plus , fold out screen feels very solidly built , not like it'll snap off your hands . i always worried my powershot a80 , it didn't feel very solid . it works well my computer , which runs linux . i use gtkam , great camera programit infrared remote used take pictures without worrying camera shake . this very useful group pictures you'd like yourself . user savable white balance settings . real flash shoe . this camera takes standard canon flash unit . manual focus mode puts close up center screen right middle picture you check focus . this would really bothsome composing pictures , except when you half depress shutter button , small zoomed square center disappears leaves you whole picture . rapid fire photo option very useful action shots , some candid stuff , like subway pictures . mechanical view finder more than just adornment this camera . it quite good , it changes its field view according current zoom setting . it also focus adjustment it . this very nice if you wear glasses , it lets you adjust view finder your eye , you get your eye right up it , not keep bumping your glasses into back camera . very wide open fstop 2.0 very closed off 8.0 . lastly , it remembers virtually everything you setup last time it or certain mode , reverts those settings next time you turn it or switch modes . this includes things like white balance , settings not remembered my powershot a80 . now negatives : door covers usb port / dc input , av output very easy catch swivelling / revolving fold out screen , screen takes fare bit effort revolve , it quite likely you'll snapped door half before you notice it gone gotten itself caught spinning lcd screen that passing . if it gotten little bent , it get caught every time fold out screen until you snap it off or bend it back place . flash way too close lens , which makes some pretty obvious shadows bottom right hand corner some photos . luckily , i'm not much flash usage , if i , i'd probably spring real flash sat hot shoe . still , if you're looking great built flash , this not camera you . slow focus , autofocus become confused objects within few yards , never really focus . plus , focusing pretty slow . if you looking camera very fast , nearly perfect autofocus , you might better camera . movies limited 3 minutes maximum , which seems rather arbitrary . even 5 minutes would big step up , it would allow me catch average musical performance one step . final word : this great compromise camera someone who really wants two separate cameras but can't afford them . it good snap shot camera , good big lense , big body , big ccd machine capable creating art . it not best either those categories when compared other cameras , but one both , it represents perfect compromise pretty reasonable price	1
i received lenses they all good quality . case comes them also very nice . i worried polarizing lens not working after reading other reviews , but mine worked fine .	1
these great filters especially price ! i looking just one uv filter , after stumbling upon this set which not much more than price one filter , i bought it . these great lenses . i especially like polarizing filter , but all 3 great . definitely worthy buy	1
this case perfect carrying protecting my camera . can't imagine not it	1
this case freaking awesome . i completely turned off 8 dollars shipping i pay , but it definetly worth it . this case looks so nice , so sleek , so beautiful it just feels good your hands . u love this case . i . borrow dollar 8 ppl if u just shipping	1
great kit , i use it lot . first , here what inside . small rocket blower - great little thing , tends whistle through red plastic tip though . so , it not great quiet places . retractable brush - great little thing , tends shed hairs , but not terribly . cleaning solution - i notice it lifted some color off multicoated lens . oddly , it only one lens , only once . lens looks fine , still takes sharp pictures without any flare . jury out , but i still use it w/o fear . cotton swabs - never used em , but they look nice . microfiber cloth - nice full sized cloth . very soft , great when buffing out spots	1
i absolutely love this camera . i've told everyone i know buy it . picture quality amazing . there so many options this tiny little camera ! you edit pictures before you even print them . zoom picture already taken save it way , so much more . i take pictures everything ! i charged battery when i got camera , which three weeks ago , it still going . i 7/8th battery life left . i haven't charge it again . i am so happy my purchase ! i hope this helps you	1
pros : - picture quality very good , but 7.2 megapixel picture 3mb wich pretty big thats reason you might want buy bigger memory card . - big 2.5 " lcd get you some attention bystanders around you . - video mode high quality very good ! this feature impressed me , i use it most ( depening occasion ) . this camera better resolution than my brothers sony camera recorder . some reason my baterry seems drain little faster than taking pictures . ( i own 2gb memory stick pro duo , wich enough record take pictures day , but i don't think battery hang in)cons : - there isn't many cons me , becuase i looking point shot camera 2.5 " lcd or 3 " - only thing i didn't like video mode you can't zoom while recording , other than this camera nice great pocket camera . - pictures come out blury times when you really shaky but sony pretty good image stabilization . ( this also great sport camera wich you capture pitures fast moving object .	1
this great camera traveling , it small enough fit into your top pocket , so it go anywhere . only problem i there no underwater housing it , if there i would given it 5 *	1
i bought this camera couple months ago because i wanted small digital camera would easy carry me . since then , i've found s5i wonderful camera takes clear colorful pictures easily fit your pocket . here some praises s5i : 1 . this camera tiny . it smaller than my cellphone . this makes it extremely easy bring when going trip or just out day . i it my pocket all times , ready capture any moment . i brought it recent trip everybody thought it great . end day we hooked it up tv hotel watched slide show day . everyone loved it . 2 . battery life incredible . i this thing couple months i only charged it like 4 times . even extended use flash screen , battery still keeps kicking . very different my cellphone ! 3 . super macro focus setting creates beautiful photos . this something i didn't realize camera until after i bought it . you get right up things take these really colorful crisp images . flowers plants look incredible . 4 . red-eye reduction best i've ever seen . red-eye flash mode , camera flashes once then second later flashes again takes picture . none my pictures suffer red-eye anymore . flash also very powerful . 5 . it many manual settings more artistic pictures . i still haven't even gotten check out all little features this camera comes . it lot different " scene " presets also allows you manual mode ( focus exposure ) . overall , this camera met exceeded all expectations i . i would definitely recommend pentax s5i family member or friend .	1
very good accessory , protects lens , helps taking very good pictures some special situations	1
i took pictures this camera artificial light , natural light , when it almost dark all my images came out sharp . i'm only using cheap 18-55mm lens , which not image stabilization . long i use tripod , or brace against something hold camera still , images perfect . i shot landscapes , portraits , animals , moving traffic , sky , moon , everything i could think it all came out right . i going buy 5d , but so far i'm satisfied this camera price way lower . now i wonder what my pictures would like lens ... hmmmm :	1
i'm very happy this lens . it offer ample variety options , high image quality it light	1
this lens truly ' must ' if you don't lots cash spend . simply put , it excellent performer money . i recently got this lens my rebel xt , noticed huge improvement over 18-55mm kit lens . sharpness improved considerably . 18-55mm some serious issues area . first all , sharpness really bad large apertures . but smaller apertures not really much better . 28-105mm still not best performer large apertures . but it much better than 18-55mm . however , around f8 or higher , 28-105mm tack sharp . addition , this lens not suffer problem clear foreground soft background my 18-55mm suffers . color accuracy also greatly improved 28-105mm . colors look much more natural this lens than 18-55mm lens . this particularly true lighter colors , especially when you go increase saturation photoshop ( or other software ) . increasing saturation improve appearance dark colors picture taken 18-55mm would typically make lighter colored objects look very unnatural . this sort problem much reduced 28-105mm . i should also say this lens appears overexpose somewhat compared 18-55mm . this more good than bad , however , it effect making lens faster . course , this lens not without its drawbacks . i mentioned slight softness large apertures , instance . also , it not fastest lens out there . but then again , what you expect price ? finally , 28mm not exactly wide angle cropped sensor digital slr like rebels or 20d . but despite these drawbacks , this lens really performs like champ . when used its element ( ie higher f-numbers ) , it works quite well . also , since it not ef-s lens , it not become paperweight should you decide upgrade 5d .	1
i given this lens after my sigma 28-135mm lens broke . while lens fixed , i haven't used it since attatching canon lens my camera . canon 28-105mm may smaller zoom range , but other than clearly superior lens every respect . it sturdy , fast-focusing , sharp , good color . short , it what you hope find when purchasing consumer grade lens . there other cheaper lenses market , like sigma lens or canon f/4- 5.6 , but this lens worth extra $100 its reliability , sharpness overall usability	1
i originally bought brand blower clean my digital camera , but after using it once i ended up introducing more dirt and/or rubber bits than i care remember . long story short i don't use my camera anymore it took me long time get all crud out my camera . but then i decided give brand try since so many people seemed able use blower bulbs without any problems . when i got my new blower my sensor already fairly clean , but after using it it little cleaner . you still sometimes those stuck particles ( i use sterile pec pads eclipse solution get rid those pretty good results , but this your own risk since it voids most camera manufacturers warranties . ) i also keep my blower original packaging keep it clean possible , i guess i am little gun shy after my first experience	1
one problems owning digital camera you'll occasionally clean dust off image sensor . you can't use compressed air because it freeze destroy your sensor . you don't really want blow either because moisture your breath damage your sensor ... make you pass out . you need " dry " , relatively-high pressure air this what rocket air outstanding . simple use . 1-remove your lens ( slr ) , 2-put into cleaning mode , 3-hang camera upside down ( presumably , allow dust fall out ) , 4-squeeze rocket air thereby cleaning camera . this point , i swear it . i'm constantly changing lenses this helps remove spects ghost images . it must your camera kit	1
this absolute do-everything flash , master/slave operation , wireless control multiple channels slave flashes , : : lighting ratio control ( better than st-e2 mere : ratio ) , full manual or automatic operation , strobe effects selectable herz rates power , even small panel serves either widen its flash coverage 17mm or simply provide catchlight model eyes when using bounce flash . range excellent , battery life very good compounded one battery packs . light itself provides excellent color , red lamp near base adds much more accurate less harsh focus assist lamp than most canon cameras provide . if you slr , you'll almost certainly want external flash . you provide fill flash reduce shadows subjects eyes etc . during harsh daylight shots , take flash off camera eliminate nasty shadows , avoid shadows caused larger lenses onboard flashes . minor quibbles : most dslrs crop ratios 1.3 or 1.6 , but don't pass this information 550ex , which wouldn't care anyway . this means flash thinks you want greater coverage than you really need ( i.e. it give you 50mm angle flash coverage , when you only need 80mm ) , so you waste lot flash power don't get optimum recycling times . also , interface little non-intuitive . if you want slave- or onboard-only flash don't need all extra features , considerably cheaper 420ex you . said , if you want all extra features , 550ex still not you . you want 580ex , slated october 2004 release , which fixes minor issues 550	1
camera perfect solution someone who not want exchangable lensesand some items more professional results . combined direct photo printer it easy fun plenty photo options dial . my only problem i not receive camera software alllow me download computer memory chip itself . there any way get this software	1
i am very happy product , it very very good , only thing it not bring multiple pictures leaving button pressed , but image quality outstanding !	1
exz750 simply fantastic compact camera . it takes great pictures , even greater if you bother use one many picture presets ( scenery , portrait , macro , etc . ) . pros : - picture quality great ; if you want anything better you'll probably lugging around dslr- picture presets extremely easy use , even if you not techie / or you've never handled camera your life ( there such person ? ) . - it fit into your pocket you'll forget it there . this major advantage best camera camera you actually you - this one you . - common settings ( picture size , iso , etc . ) one or two clicks away - very convenientthe cons : - camera take videos ( more than decent resolution ) but they come out shaky even if you pretty steady hands . without some image stabilization it , it definitely not replacement video camera- although camera iso settings 200 400 you should probably avoid them due noiseoverall , very positive pleasing experience . even digital slr , i'm never giving this little puppy up	1
this lens my favorite i keep it my rebel xt all times . i enjoy taking macro close-ups portrai t-t ype shots , which makes this great lens everyday use . it light-weight not bulky . my last slr camera ( years ago ) minolta 50mm f/ 1.8 lens , various other lenses i rarely used . i usually don't use zoom lens due extra length weight . also , most non-professional zoom lenses much slower closest tele-position due higher f/stop . fixed focal length 60mm , i don't mind moving myself toward or away subject ( not big deal ) . pictures always appear sharp good contrast color saturation . my opinion this lens : " buy it ... you'll like it " . i ... i love it . good luck	1
if you would like list sites reviews email gumby dontquotemeonthat dot com pros : very sharp , bright ( fast ) , versatile , excellent build quality . cons : af tends dicy low-light conditions . pros : sharp , sharp , sharp . no distortion , no ca , optically superb better cons : ef-s mount . sell it when i upgraded 5d . pros : very solid build , internal focusing fantastic , produces wonderfully saturated photos high contrast , bokeh lovely very smooth , auto focus typical ring-usm full time manual focus excellent smooth . 2.8 aperture , 52mm filter size cons : i feel canon could reduce price , however this quality i don't mind paying it . if your newbie here some info lens " fast " when it low f-stop ... ok so when you smaller number apature bigger which allows more light through , so this means you up shutter speed . still enough light reach sensor . ok so lets say you out door shot if you say f/4 lens shutter speed could 1/250 second you would get good exposer . now this lens only go f/4 but if you same outdoor setting , f/ 2.8 lens you could jump 1/500 second get same exposer . freeze action mmore effectivly , this i believe why it " fast " lens . ok fun get it	1
new canon ef-s 60mm 2.8 macro usm digital slr lens designed cover entire field digital imaging sensors canon digital slr line , most notably canon eos 20d . this corresponds film normal lens perspective approximately 50mm lens . furthermore it benefits canon usm autofocusing technology , allowing photograher rapid , almost silent , autofocus , which important when working field ( you don't want distract animal you photographing sound lens focused . ) . although this lens not series lens , quality its construction comes close canon premium series professional line lenses . indeed , i read elsewhere excellent test report ( i believe erwin puts website ) this lens praising its optical performance . any canon user digital slrs such eos 20d who interested macro photography regard this lens absolutely essential making great macro images	1
works great orignal battery . you never know difference except lot cheaper !	1
i bought this battery extra battery my camera . it lot lower price than canon battery . i not used either my original or this extra battery enough fully compare them , but they seem work equally well so far	1
i purchased my 300d may 2005 , when xt released this 6.3 mp model price began falling . i'd really pick this camera apart tell you downsides it ; disregard reviews those who think this camera not up par -- course it not comparable eos 1-series or 5d , so don't expect same features or capabilities . right user , however , get similar results . said , unless you professional photographer , i cannot imagine how digital rebel could inadequate any amateur or semi-pro shooter . it speed megapixels since passed , but it still , especially now , great buy . kit lens perform you just fine , although most my shots kit lens 18mm , landscape or just wide-angle shots . flash works very well most situations , even extremely dark rooms . one guy complained his af hunted low light situations , even flash ... course , what you expect dark room ? use manual focus grow up . quality great iso 100-400 , although 800 somewhat ugly times , 1600 basically unusable , especially if you're not shooting f/ 2.8 or bigger . my main complaints : slow start-up time compared newer models ( xt , 20d , etc ) ... camera seems out breath after continuous shooting ; take 8 shots quickly you may notice camera needs process info before it shoot again . 2.5 frames/second not very fast if you're shooting any sports . overall , this camera incredibly reliable me ; it gotten me front page shots newspapers , magazine covers , calendars websites . i used it so much i blew out shutter 10 months ; canon fixed it no charge it works fine since . one minor problem : very rarely , it won't turn unless i remove battery re-insert it . i've found battery life fantastic . i use it all day , even flash , still some life end day . backup battery your bag should give you more than enough insurance day . i've printed 11x17 excellent results . some practice , it very easy navigate . menus options simple ; changing iso or aperture very easy despite what some complained . it very reliable fully-auto mode well , especially if you're shooting flash . memory card reader must when uploading images . overall : it old news world digital slrs , but right now , new or used model such good price really great value	1
i owned canon eos digital rebel 6.3 mp several weeks now love it . fantastic pictures features . i worked slr many years . figured it time " move up " digital slr glad i . this camera plenty features available , or you just set it " auto " works fine , too . though optional flash not needed most photography i wanted one far shots such . canon makes several models dedicated this camera , but i find them weak ( 220ex ) or costly . shop carefully trying find compatible flash . it needs " dedicated " digital rebels . one work af ( auto focus ) or slr ( film ) rebel may not work right . i also received conflicting information ritz camera , both on-line stores . bottom line , if you need flash , shop carefully ask all right questions . personally i held off buying one hoping more models lower price come out . camera already small pop-up flash . btw , tamron af 70-300 macro 1:2 zoom nice lens buy it , priced nicely beach camera	1
i recently moved into prosumer level digital . canon d30 proven awesome camera . there maybe better ( d60 ) , but if you serious digital , d30 one best cameras price . there slight lag shots , but if you not photographing speeding bullets express trains , time shots hardly distraction	1
this camera designed entry-level snapshot camera it very good just . it takes decent photos very easy use . other reviewers indicated , it tend chew through batteries , but i just buy aas cheap sam don't worry it . it works especially well outdoor situtions . it performs less well low light . due this limitation , it just useless webcam . even all lights room , webcam image almost totally black . flash lens less than inch apart , so this camera very prone redeye . there redeye reduction mode flash works okay , but doesn't totally fix problem . all-in-all , entry-level camera , a200 quite usable . just aware what it don't expect it more .	1
pros : excellent picture quality , great zoom , nice panoramic feature , sd card , great video sound quality picture camera , best you this money lcd rotate any angle . cons : flash not pop up automatically ; just 16mb sd card box . pd : this camera size not pocket one but size good enough shoot one hand . advice : use rechargeable batteries large sd card ( 2 or 4 gb ) cause video so good you love shooting . also , must times you need flash indoor other way you bad pics ; flash results amazed you .	1
works great point-and-shoot auto mode . camera just enough advanced features keep novice photographer happy long time . battery life great if you purchase top quality rechargables . large , least 1g sd card , should used . image stabilization works well . tripod necessary if using camera full zoom	1
though i am not qualified write quality filters , they seem doing job pretty well . finish good they fit well 58 mm canon lense my rebel xt . lense cap goes right over it so it doubly protected . small pouch hold three filters also big help keep them safe easily accessable	1
this camera lot modes you use . it very good resolution optical zoom . 12x optical zoom you click awesome pictures , specially live performances sightseeing trips . 5 mp resolution more than enough , otherwise pics become just too big fit one screenshot . you also panoramic pictures it . only two complaints - flash recycling time should lesser , sd card comes it only 16 mb , which hardly enough 7-8 pics . you buy 512 mb or 1 gb sd card separately . also , batteries come it not rechargeable , so you buy charger batteries well , which not so expensive . but these drawbacks there s3is also . overall , this camera gives very clear pictures worth buying if you happen get it decent price .	1
i viewed concert photos taken s2 number different photographers they absolutely took my breath away . saw output other cameras comparison they didn't even come close . i using canon a80 prior while i happy it , my first round photos s2 proved most impressive . while you use this point shoot , this camera you should spend some time learning so you get most it . although s3 latest version camera , i'm not sure you get much more money	1
i mainly bought this go end lens adapter s2 . it well protect lens , but you can't put lens cap over it . it ends up easier use without lens cap ... quicker when taking pictures . pictures very good through it	1
i took few identical photos without this filter , saw no difference sharpness nor contrast . so , if you're looking save damage your lense , this way go . i like able clean this filter quickly . otherwize i would spend 10-20 minutes cleaning lense so very carefull not scratch it . also , it minimize uv haze ... but i havn't compared with/without type situation . ( please comment if you different opinion ... ( brand )	1
this lens so many uses . anytime i position myself where my subject more than five feet away , this my lens choice . i kit 18-70mm came d70 50mm prime ( i 18-200 vr order , if nikon ever get around catching up demand , lens might surpass this one , due smaller weight - plus it lot cheaper ) . i took every lens i own d70 british museum london . shooting handheld available light ( i never used flash ) many egyptian greek artifacts over fifty feet away , i got outstanding results this lens . vr technology amazing . constant 2.8 aperture also major advantage . i'll grant you my arm felt like rubber hose after four hours site seeing , but it worth it ! i similar satisfaction using lens outdoors wildlife photography . i even used tc-20eii teleconverter lens , shoot hummingbirds great distance . i would no reservations recommending lens , until nikon announced 18-200 vr . this new lens much broader focal length low end , focuses much closer ( around foot , compared five feet 70-200 ) . 18-200 not provide constant 2.8 aperture across it focal length , so 70-200 would better long distances low light . but less than half price , i think less than half size , this new lens clearly premier spot my bag . it totally replace 70-200vr ? i'll update my review when i finally get try lens block . until then , 70-200mm vr champ	1
this lens only two " faults . " first , it big heavy -- quality construction often yields heavy lens . second , once photographer seen results this lens produce , there likelihood he or she unhappy other lenses camera bag . results first : images razor sharp this zoom mounted my nikon d70s . i get shots i never could get before because this lens so crisp subjects taken distance nevertheless cropped produce acceptable close-up image . subjects taken more normal distances breathtakingly sharp -- if shot excellent prime lens . this fast lens ( f/ 2.8 throughout its entire zoom range ) . almost more importantly , this lens best " bokeh " i ever experienced lens . " bokeh , " extent i understand concept ( it japanese word meaning roughly " unfocused " ) , word describing whether out-of-focus portion image ( i.e. blurred background photo which only subject focus ) pleasing look it . this lens produces wonderful , creamy bokeh . sharpness bokeh , combined excellent bright color rendition this lens , makes this one true classic . i occasionally experienced minor ghosting this lens when shooting into very bright subject , i.e. sun reflecting off ocean . this normal shortfall zoom lens comprised multitude elements , i sometimes experienced this . but such occasions rare . autofocusing action this lens very good . even birds very long distances usually produce quick , snappy autofocus lock my nikon d70s . very seldom it " hunt " af lock , these occasions likely due operator error rather than lens . this lens also features vibration reduction ( vr ) which enables it produce acceptable images below what f/ 2.8 lens would otherwise suitable . vr really works , too , although it no means panacea dim lighting . this one nikon professional lenses , quality construction excellent . critical mount metal , entire lens built like tank . lens comes nice squeeze-style lens cap , very good lens hood easily reversed storage . reader see i am extremely enamored this lens . reason , notwithstanding its bulk weight , this lens produces best nature shots i ever managed take , far .	1
i buy this uv filter protect my kit lens(18-55mm ) , so far so good . i am using canon rebel xd . if you just want get cheap uv protect your lens , buy this one	1
i get least uv filter all my lenses . that cheapest insurance you get you lense . protect it possible scratches banging against objects . haven't really seen major difference brand filter tiffen filter . i would just go cheapest filter found you lens	1
i recently purchased this camera it very easy use takes nice pictures . i bought case put it so i could keep screen getting scratched . go out find generic camera bag fit it . they so much cheaper than canon camera bags . only thing this camera i would like change i wish it battery life indicator .	1
i like canon digital camera because it everything average person may want . it light , great design , works incredibly good i make hundreds pictures . isn't dream come true ? highest recommendation	1
i nikon d50 , when attaching camera , tilting base tripod needs little compensation camera weight . hence , i haven't found any use libelle tripod . i look through wiev finder see if my set-up level or not . overall though , it not big problem , hey , price tripod , i'll live it	1
this stuff worth your small money , useful your precious cameras	1
lens pens don't perfect job , but they better job than anything thing else i found . it " must " product anyone camera ! nikon lens pen worked well me	1
i bought this pen my boyfriend his new canon digital rebel slr , but you could use it almost anything lens . it got small brush one end swipe away big stuff , round felt tip other cleaning smudges . he finds it very useful it fits right hiw camera bag	1
i'm surprised see lot people only give 1 * this camera ! i've it 2 years now i just love it ! thanks it , i discovered i real passion photography ... it very easy use my pictures great ! when i show them , people usually tell me " you must expensive camera " ... i just show them my little canon s500 they surprised result!i'm just loving it	1
i needed replace lost s4oo we year . looked sd series thought them too small comfort . there such thing too thin handle comfortably . s500 , like s400 , just right size . big area back thumb so you even one-hand hold it . try any sd . pictures excellent hand-held . not nikon n70 film slr good , but plenty good enough any snapshot purpose . bought one last new s500 available newegg abd very , very happy it	1
this flash preforms excellence ! all nikon products i pro grade . this flash recycles fast ready when i need extra light fill main light . i purchased sb-600 d-200 am very happy it . i used it last six weddings this year shooting action shots skate boarding compitions . . wolf , atl . ga	1
i've quite satisfied my nikon d50 i've using built-in flash occasionally get evenly lit images balanced exposed shots . but built-in flash just doesn't cut it . i made huge mistake taking pics my cousin wedding reception huge hall thinking tripod , high iso settings , built-in flash suffice . i wrong . i borrowed fellow photographer spare speedlight ( sb-600 ) when i downloaded pics my computer some fine tuning , i noticed huge difference built-in flash . speedlight gave me more area covered flash . roughly under $200+ , this quite bargain . i'd recommend rechargeable aa batteries . recycle time flash fast .	1
i bought this flash use my nikon d200 it works better than i hoped . you fine tune it your own personal liking it more options than i am currently smart enough use . but don't worry , you don't super camera geek get great results right off bat . this thing great " reach " it actually zooms right your lens pinpoint your subject . it just audible enough let you know it doing . i'm definitely glad i bought this thing . much better than small pop-up flash	1
very solid camera , but bit heavy . good battery life . it very professional camera	1
i developed dimple my right retina places blur center my field view . i am right handed so my right eye my " sighting eye " . this device gives me clearance use my left eye focus compose my shots . i love it	1
i've my d70s year now , haven't regretted it second . controls laid out logically , everything hand . dual control wheels make adjustments fast accurate . i personally love optional grid overlay , i no excuses horizons aren't horizontal . wireless flash system great , though you buy sb-600 or sb-800 get full benefit . this camera bigger heavier than d50 d80 , which my opinion positive thing .	1
excellent camera kit . versatile . i lot learn camera , though , it no simple point-and-shoot . however , auto mode , it takes great point-and-shoot pictures . i look forward learning how use it fully . lenses came warranty cards , but camera itself not . i bought sb-600 flash well battery two 1 gb compact flash cards round out kit . camera lens attached large , which i underestimated . $80 camera bag too small it all . great camera , though . price best i could find anywhere	1
i'm looking closeup lens my canon eos rebel xt . but before buying i wish i see some pictures taken using this lens	1
i got this lens because i didn't really own anything close this range except kit lens ( good but not great not f/ 2.8 ) . i own 15mm canon fisheye but it distort quite bit even 20d i don't like correct photoshop each time i wanted wide lens . i wanted something wider , could capture lots light ( i allot ambient low light photowork ) i wanted something versatile ( 20d this really 24mm 56mm --- great working range ) . pros : 1 ) 1.6 crop factor my 20d this really 24 56mm lens . this makes it quite bit less wide angle more midrange lens . consequently , it stays my camera all time covers most my daily needs . i bought this lens fully expecting it 24 56 i wanted it multi purpose 24mm its still pretty wide . 2 ) i try avoid flash much possible given type photography i f/ 2.8 i take some great ambient light pictures i would not able otherwise3 ) f/ 2.8 , i also blow backgrounds foregrounds out focus . out focus areas gorgeously buttery blokeh very nice given 7 blades shutter . 4 ) color saturation like nothing i've ever seen before except my 70-200mm canon " " . i literally floored some baby pictures i took where colors two words " mind blowing " . i knew color would great but " wow ! " photoshop cs2 i " fake " saturation but its just not quite same color came out this lens straight out box . zero photoshop touchup needed . 5 ) its sharp ! this lens takes some amazingly sharp pictures into what i would classify amazing . i've received numerous positive comments sharpness this lens . i've tried looking edges see if there any ca or less sharpness couldn't really find any . maybe full size sensor you tell more but i couldn't really 20d . i notice plane focus f/ 2.8 narrow ( which good ) i make sure everything i want focus . blokeh very buttery f/ 2.8 . i like it quite bit . 6 ) its built like tank . black metal shell . metal ef mount . smooth manual focusing . sturdy recessed switches . red stripe catches eye photographers who know .... easy strike up conversations learn . 7 ) it surprisingly smaller lighter than i thought it would . half size my 70-200mm canon " " . i expecting it bigger am much happier it wasn't . its my camera all time not chore carry around all . unless you're very petite person . 8 ) internal focusing . so lens size doesn't change size or turn when focusing . this very useful when you put filters or when you're focusing close . 9 ) usm motor . its whisper quiet it focuses super fast . faster than my 70-200mm .... something i'd expect but wow its fast silent . 10 ) it focuses pretty close 12 inches or so . you get close your subject . its not macro lens but you get some dramatic wide angle shots its close focusing . 11 ) its ttl2 so works very nice my 580ex flash . 12 ) ef mount grow you . if you upgrade your camera body full frame camera ef mount , this lens fit your new camera you continue enjoy your lens investment . cons : 1 ) 1.6 frame size , it doesn't get into " amazing " wide category but that not fault lens . i'm marking this down con but you take it several ways . if you want get ultra-wide small frame camera , you won't this lens ( although 24mm pretty darn wide ) your only canon options 15mm fisheye which i own think great specialty lens , 10-22mm efs canon , 14mm . 10-22 i hear very good but its efs ( won't fit full frame cameras - less upgradable i think ) its not lens although non-l 10-22 i hear exceptional . 14mm ef run you almost much this 16-35mm zoom . 15mm ef fisheye wonderful but it designed distort distortion visible 20d even more so full frame cameras you need photoshop fix . this 16-35mm , if you want f/ 2.8 ok something like 24-56 , then you won't find better small-sensor cameras . i'm very glad i got it , if you already full frame camera or upgrade some point , you enjoy 16mm " wow " wide . i only imagine coverage i'd get full frame camera . 2 ) hood massive ... wide but not very deep ... so its shallow hood ( it wide angle i guess ) . i never take it off -- it keeps stray light out secondary protection lens . i zero problems lens flare . 3 ) front lens element sink out inside tube ( exposed but lens case doesn't change size ) . there no protective filter protect front element . i bought uv/haze filter ($26 amazon ) i highly recommend you well protect your investment . uv/haze filter , lens very self contained . 4 ) oh cost .... my oh my . expensive heck . cost much my camera body --- worth every penny . if its any consolation , these lenses very hard make they keep their value . your camera body might drop value new technology arrives but this lens hold its value if you take care it . differences , notes , things i've heard : 1 ) i no experience non canon lenses so i can't compare but this 16-35 amazing . 2 ) compared other " " lenses , it holds up quality amazing when it comes color , performance , lens construction . 3 ) i hear there some chromatic aberation edges these wide lenses ( well more than 70-200mm ) but that expected when you're gathering light such wide angles focusing it .... that got hard . wide angles exhibit more ca than long telephotos . my 16-35mm it wasn't visible me . i imagine pro pro might notice care . anybody less stringent requirements than pro pro or extremely saavy person , couldn't even notice or care . besides , ca this lens orders magnitude less than almost any other lens . 4 ) i bought directly amazon . ordered monday got lens next day tuesday . amazing service . great store .	1
we dedicated thumb drive use digital photo frame we download our digital pictures computer . then we simply plug thumb drive into usb port digital photo frame follow menu instructions select usb port thumb drive pushing couple buttons digital photo frame . slide show pictures we view approximately ten feet away very good resolution . it great family gatherings received many positive comments our guests .	1
great idea poorly executed . construction cheap . screen marginal best . but worst all , it refuses recognize any 3 digital cameras i hand or usb card reader . piece junk i am now returnin	-1
i purchased 8 10 photo frame way display photos my wedding reception planned use it my home thereafter . i able get product running load ' test ' set pictures , but product then ' froze ' startup screen . i checked pacific digital support website , which provided steps ( basically , sequence buttons hold down ) ' unfreeze ' reinitialize unit . i tried this sequence several times , no avail , then called pacific digital customer service . after repeated messages left voice mail system ( " we're sorry we missed your call - we'll get back you " ) all times day night , i unable contact anyone company no calls ever returned . long story short - our wedding came went , problem never ( apparently never ) resolved , digital photo frame now $390 paperweight . absolutely useless . my recommendation : not purchase pacific digital product . this clearly fly-by-night outfit	-1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
if you swim ocean , lake , or just like around water want take pictures , this thing , it worth every penny !! only thing you can't when it case upload pictures your computer , change out memory cards charge battery . it truly amazing . i've my eye this very long time cruise coming up i knew i get it . i'm snorkeling enthusist this definatly thing . instead those silly disposable cameras limit you only 27 pictures , you haven't got clue exactly what you've taken picture , you take many your memory card allow you . there also filter flash you slide into place help dispurse light get ideal picture underwater !	1
lens hood performs it should limiting stray light but it little sloppy comes off easily if bumped . it easy attach reverses quickly easy storage . pretty much no brainer but money i'd like little better fit	1
nice hood . it designed canon ef-s 17-85mm lens therefore what it supposed .	1
i bought this camera my wife christmas 04 ' i thought i ordered it too late it arrive time christmas , but these people great ! they got it me time we love this camera we use it all time - we several accs . item it quality picture wonderful . thanks mark christian	1
item exactly described . works perfectly helped make some great shots yosemite	1
it what it says it'll , while it pricey couple contact switches plastic handle , considering cost parts my time make something similar , it bargain . i would liked more heavy duty construction , contacts more definite tactile feedback focus vs shoot position , but it works just fine , it lets me take pictures while talking more easily subject , addition obvious vibration reduction	1
i bought this lens i walking out africa month half safari . i didn't own true wide angle lens i just spent most my budget 70-200mm usm " " lens 1.4 extension . i wanted get widest lens i could get but i didn't big bucks get 16-35l or 14mm so i got this lens figuring i could correct photoshop cs2 later . this what i found : 1 ) i 20d it doesn't barrel distort anywhere near bad i thought it would .... i imagine it distorts quite bit more 5d or other full frame sensor but 20d , 10d , 30d , or rebel it not bad . 2 ) it distort enough even 20d its noticable every single inside shot many panoramic shots .... experienced professional , you'd notice it even panoramas . 3 ) computer person : i find it very easy correct barrel distortion photoshop cs2 very easily .... i use plugin ( there several web)4 ) i tend like barrel distortion look some my pictures . pros1 ) image quality superb . not lens , this lens some amazing color , sharpness , saturation . they spared very little grinding this lens . some my best african pictures , daytime nightime taken this lens they fabulous . 2 ) build pretty well , metal mount , metal integrated hood ... but not up standards any means .... its credit , it survived 14 days vibration ridden truck treking across kalahari desert all its dust , mokoro canoeing okavango delta over week , hiking , elephant riding , five diamond resort victoria falls ( last one easy fisheye ) ... 3 ) it fisheye lens if used properly , it create some amazing pictures views ... example botswana okavango , i knelt down next gigantic baobab tree pointed it up towards sky , fisheye captured not only rex guide standing next tree but entire massive trunk baobab all canopy tree way above . everything ! i know few lenses would let me . it amazing shot only possible fisheye . 4 ) it focuses 12inches . 5 ) f/ 2.8 makes it very good low light situation . 6 ) integrated hood comes complete nice metal cover . cons1 ) its not built like : ) no usm motor so you hear whir it tries focus ) no moisture seals etc ) it metal mount2 ) it fisheye lens -- i found out after month half what this meant .... it doesn't stay my camera much . i take it out when i need certain effect or when i plan retouch photoshop . it distorts visibly 20d i imagine quite bit more full frame . 3 ) integrated hood ... can't put screw filters ... but it gel filter holder . 4 ) no bag . my veredict : 1 ) i've purchased 16-35mm canon " " lens stays camera most time when i want wide-angle but when i need special look or i really want capture everything , i bring out my 15mm fisheye . i won't sell it , i don't regret buying it . i learned what specialty fisheye lens its staying my arsenal those special shots . 2 ) i can't compare against non-canon lenses but i say canon quality here extraordinary . i would knock them construction but lens built well enough " glass " itself spectacular so 5 stars . 3 ) i ordered amazon 3 days before my trip --- it arrived next day . great service . thx amazon .	1
first , let me cover most important point : it work ? yes . praise most users express this item well merited . i purchased this because , like everyone else , normal batteries just not last . ten or fifteen photos , especially if you used flash , they'd ready change ; even so-called " heavy duty " or those marketed " digital camera " didn't make difference . well , both those terms should reserved these power cells ; they really less like battery more like power pack . my first charge up , which took only 3 hours 6 minutes - i timed it - i wanted actually test how many photos one could get . my smaller camera , 3mp fujifilm finepix s3100 , i got 52 photos , some flash , most without . not random snaps see how many it could record , but actually taking time frame them , select composition , etc . camera stayed entire time using full lcd rather than viewfinder , took all photos highest-resolution setting , transferred auto , manual , situational modes , charged full flash 8 times , went into preview mode . three hours , 47 minutes later , i got " low battery " warning - not depleted - low . i stopped then , sure i not overpaid . ** note : these power cells likely last much longer than 3h47m . lower resolution may result more photos . these numbers simply represent unscientific but strenuous personal test see what product would o.o ther notes product : - all parts except door made hard , impact resistant plastic . - fold away plug back makes charger easier store . - red green leds very bright , no mistake charge full mode . - two " channels " , . seems charge sets batteries best ; this may issue reviewer who reported issues using one battery time . - black ( body back ) , silver ( body front ) blue ( door ) looks nice . i one complaint , though perhaps it only one founded pure puzzlement . door flips open ... right . when holding unit your hand , monster logo top led bottom , door flips open right . my guess this decision made so door didn't close your hand when loading , because most people tilt it their left hand so it facing away them 45 degrees ; i know i . my final review : 5 out 5	1
after reading reviews , just bought charger . first charge took 3 hours , then led turned green . i accidentally disconnected power , when i plug it again , led turns orange , start charging again . this hurt battery	1
i bought one these my canon sd-800 recommend it . many years now , i've carried canon pocket cameras my belt while traveling canon-branded cases simply best this purpose . my only criticism canon cases their lack small pocket media . i hoping tiny size sd cards canon would added such pocket their newer cases , but they haven't . plus side , case retains superior leather construction , uses neat magnetic tie down flap instead velcro or snap , belt loop tight enough hold camera comfortably against your body . package also includes nice looking leather replacement strap your camera . incidentally , sd-800 well matched case , fitting quite securely	1
i'm owner canon sd630 . this case fit very good my camera it very good kind leather	1
i originally bought case walmart but it just wasnt working out . what difference this one made . fits like glove well worth few extra dollars this one cost comparison ill fitting one . i highly recomend this your canon sd630plus service delivery excellent	1
just what i needed out spend fortune glass filter protect my expensive nikon lenses . i bought one each my different lenses because i would rather break filter than glass lens	1
filter decent . i paid only $3 free shipping so im not expecting much out this filter . i bought it protection it perfectly . not best night shots obviously but overall good buy	1
i bought this camera based several online reviews , including steve digicams , couldn't more pleased . i've using it since last christmas ( bought it present myself after six months looking various brands models ) . aside image quality ( which it plenty ) i insisted least lcd viewfinder ( evf ) well screen , real filter ring ( no adapters , please ! ) easy basic controls , long optical zoom , cf card , hot shoe ability use ordinary aa batteries pinch . also fit my hand feel natural . this all , plus actual cable release socket shutter button ! ( thus i easily use my cable bulb releases , well long-duration timer i my 35mm kit . ) it also standard pc socket more flash options than built flash or hot shoe . heft good , but not very heavy . you carry it long time without fatigue , but it enough mass steady your hand , enough size easy gripping . i find it very instinctive point shoot it . most basic control locations convenient easily remembered . ( zoom manual only , but suits me . i don't like waiting motorized zooms get where i want , especially zoom range this long . ) i'll leave it pro reviewers discuss image merits , but i say me they seem perfectly sharp very good color even default settings . addition , i've gotten very good results shooting night very long exposures . ( starry sky , clouds backlit moon , streets under moonlight streetlamps , etc . ) much less noise " grain " than i've experienced other cameras . so far it closest film i've found such situations - any price i afford , leas t.t he electronic viewfinder ( evf ) bright sharp performs well low light . i don't miss optical viewfinder much all . there diopter adjustment accomodate most people visiion . ( stops just short enough my worst eye - comes closer than most , though - but i find i use efv my glasses if i want ) . one accessory i strongly recommend soft rubber , wide angle , lens shade ( 58mm filter ring ) . they found cheap ( i paid $7 local store ) protect rim lens when you set down camera addition shading lens . there included hard-plastic lens shade clips outside lens rim , but t " notched " i worry catching it things - i like soft rubber ones better ( they look more " pro " too ) . it may interfere supplemental illumination lamp focussing , so you'll want remove it when shooting close mid-range photos dim light	1
( wife account holder)i knew before i bought this camera it just what i needed ! i am semi-pro-am photography hobby job . i knew i didn't need $5k camera we work , but wanted something more than my $200 point shoot . this it ! out box , it took 15 min take my first pic . hardest part threading camera strap lens cap holder - nice little detail . main selling point me " natural light " mode . tried flash without mode quality amazing . my little ps didn't any good low light without flash , this camera gets a+ . few minor notes i wanted make before i lovestruck : lcd screen no protection , just kind out there open . cover or even just little plastic stick-on most low end cameras come would enough make me feel like it isn't going bust . viewfinder really just mini-lcd screen , which i imagine bit number batteries , though not much full size lcd back . menu looks pretty extensive , but fairly easy navigate once it becomes little more familiar . so far , i love it , but took off one star because lcd issue . maybe i find cover or something it help me feel better it . other than , i already tell this camera everything i need take great pics get creative some manual settings exposure manipulation . love it takes xd cf cards - both camera same time ! save movies one , pics other ! it feels pretty solid , takes super inexpensive aa batteries - selling point me , hot shoe sync capabilities . if you looking go slr , but can't fork out dough , this perfect alternative . ( though check around price - [ ... ] rebate , i got mine less than [ ... ] !!	1
i am pleased this camera . its pretty easy use . i virtually no camera experience , save breaking them . this camera easy operate pretty fun fool around . i used aperture setting several times get different focus points pics . instructions easy comprehend . i taken quite bit sports photos i noticed its extremely difficult get shots inside gymnasium . shots usually very blurry color just isn't right most time . fluorescent modes camera helpful , but not fix problem . it could just me though	1
i'm using it few months now ; i haven't found single problem so far . earlier , i using old finepix optic/sensor sensitivity not very good ; poor quality photos taken dark environment . this not problem any more . also , i impressed sharpness photos sport actions taken 10x zoom . general , i pretty enthusiastic all features this camera ; it took me nearly 3 days try everything out :-) . sure , there better cameras market ; however , considering price it just great deal	1
quality definitely great . when attached s3 , it makes your camera look serious taking good shots . if you attaching hood doing flash photography , i suggest you use slave flash eliminate shadow caused hood	1
i bought this camera because small size , megapixles zoom + digital zoom . i wanted something take outdoors into wilderness not worry hurting it . price wise i feel this camera offers pleanty featrues very reasonable price	1
this excellent pocket camera it lives up nikon reputation quality . while it lacks some controls seen more sophisticated models pictures please most demanding this class camera . i liked it so well i bought two , one myself one gift budding photographer	1
this camera worth every penny . i just recieved it today so far i like it lot . seems well made , nice size lcd screen , takes good pictures what i seen so far . battery life seems good . it 15 scene modes which you would not expect camera it price range . macro mode excellent ! only downsides really time it takes when you take picture time you take next , it takes second flash charge . camera only comes 10mb internal memory , so unless you going invest bigger memory card , you only able take 6 pictures . video mode good , but not any sound . overall i give it 4.5 . price paid : $11	1
using either ef 16-35mm lenses or ef-s 10-22mm lenses ( 20d or rebel bodies 1.6 crop factor ) this hood helps eliminate ( i mean reduce lot ) flare sunny days or certain lightning conditions ..... highly recommended those who like shot lower end ( 16mm ) these lenses .	1
nikon d50 absolutely fantastic camera . if you moving point shoot , you jump completely new leage photography . pros : 1 . noise extremely low iso 800 , highly usable 1600.2 . camera control good , you get 2.5 frame per second , more than enough non-professionals . 3 . flash sync 1/500 sec , one best market . 4 . image quality ( iq ) excellent . cons : 1 . lcd screen small . 2 . top lcd no back light . 3 . no depth field review button . regards , csoura	1
i am very happy this camera . it takes very good photos automatic mode , but all extra features make you want learn how take amazing photos . also , i big hands so camera feels lot nicer my hands than canon digital rebel xt . only improvements i would make camera : 1 - i am big guy so strap doesn't seem quite long enough . eventually i'll pick up new one . 2 - battery charger setup very bulky . i'm not quite sure why they chose put 5 foot electric cable onto charger instead making it plug directly into outlet . 3 - after used canon camera software , nikon preview mode zoom feature seems cumbersome . otherwise this camera great . i'm looking forward learning more picking up lense	1
i've a510 six months pleasantly surprised ease use reasonable picture quality 3.2 camera . after six months lens cover jammed i noticed many amazon reviewers same issue . one evening i took several pictures next morning camera would not operate . i'm hoping service center provide me better service than some reviewers .	1
i am am very happy this package . only issue , thick stainless steel neck strap . i no use it i never seen anyone using it . i would prefer extra battery or existing battery extended life one . overall , price you cannot get leather case battery combo somewhere else same price amazon . i consider neck strap unnecessary component one comes camera lighter more flexible . it also more elegant .	1
i rated accessory kit 3 well . gave kit 3 3 star . i gave kit 2 my mom who just got sd550 . great camera what i tell . this kit however needs major improvements . going best kit 2 , worst it , we starting review battery pack . battery ... uhhh , not much say here . spare battery use hot spare out there if your running low after taking too many shots . mine kit 3 great i still use it this day . i swap active battery each time i charge . this what gave this product many stars i given it . final decision ( battery ): wonderfulneck strap ... ( taken kit 3 added improvements)if your moving around this thing way long or way short . it too short strap across you chest . it way long because if it hangs front you , your precious camera you just paid couple few hundred now freely bouncing around . not good . my mom really short this just too short her use well . not much bouncing issue me but still not useful enough her . her comment , " this strap either too short or too long . doesn't fit me all . " cracks me up because i never told her my personal opinion matter she came up same results . final decision ( neck strap ): use it jump drive you use often or anything else . just not your precious camera . case ... they screwed up kit 3 , this kit still screwed up ( managed even worse than kit 3 ) . velcro fine most usage so i can't knock . belt clip fine dandy . case pretty darn good keeping camera safe outside elements harm . hole center useless heck just like kit 3 ( mom came same conclusion ) . here where they really screwed up . stitching this case worse than kit 3 . kit 3 , you only worry stitching screwing up your screen back case . this case , you stiching back front . unlike kit 3 which magnetic clasp where stitching or any attachment case hidden behind soft cloth , this one velcro stitching inside front . belt clasp stiching other side . no escape this kit . i highly advise you get screen protector if using this case . poor design shame people who manufacture this case . final decision ( case ): " move people ... nothing see here . " seriously ... don't bother using this case without screen protector . complete decision : i wouldn't buy this kit again all . it great there extra battery but i don't think anything else worth penny more this kit . better off buying everything seprate . going lower my rating 2 stars	1
i tried this product out local camera store before i sold idea . two main things i concerned how it attach it add too much weight camera . attaching camera little concerning , i worried it may damage camera . but , after watching guy our local camera shop put one rebel i sold . basically you remove door battery compartment . which comes off lot easier than i anticipated . grip slides like battery you screw it bottom camera . don't worry their hole bottom grip tripod . grip add weight but its not significant i noticed it adds lot stability while holding it . since grip adds height camera its easier hold camera one hand . much like holding one more expensive models . it also adds battery life since grip holds two batteries . if you hold new grip take pictures camera its side . you pleasantly surprised see duplicate set buttons scroll wheel added new grip just purpose . it now permanent attachment i am glad i decided buy it . buttons work just well camera even 3fps . note quality canon grip much better than cheaper version .	1
i've used battery grip almost every canon camera i've owned since 1980 . this rebal xt battery life seems almost forever battery grip , gets doubled . grip also allows you use regular batteries so you could use them should rechargables ever die you need keep shooting . it adds shutter release button turning camera 90 degrees . larger hands would probably find camera more comfortable more grip area . it adds more mass which pro ( little more stability ) or con ( heavier carry around ) . it would nice if canon could slightly remolded it stand camera up . it , camera lean forward it lense . bottom line : i'm glad i purchased but think it could much cheaper . when you consider ( way back when ) these types devices added motor winder ( standard modern film slrs not used digital cameras ) added battery capacity . all this adds additonal battery capacity . price reason 4 stars instead 5 . course most businesses don't care long people buying . mark	1
if you're serious photography , get this accessory . second battery , i get plenty juice any event ( even my zoom lens using image stabilization ) . gives solid grip taking vertical ( portrait ) pictures while still access controls you need . i can't imagine without it now ( spite additional weight ) .	1
i am so pleased this camera ! there really nothing negative i think say it ! i also own cannon xt . i use both wedding photography well family portraits i am so impressed color quality d30 ! well cannon	1
those who truly know digital cameras , more than perhaps 8 megapixels important only if you plan blowing your images up " poster size " , or if you pro who knows how use all those pixels . truthfully , how many you really plan type stuff ? say rebel xti better than 30d because it " more megapixels " " smaller " not best advice . any canon dslr going give you great images , if know how use it . those you who trying decide which camera buy , you really need go camera store ask handle each camera . while you're it , ask yourself how it feels your hands . it too bulky ? it too small hard handle ? it features you want such spot metering , which rebel xti not ? 30d terrific dslr . it all features 99% us need . there reason why it costs more than rebel . 30d better camera overall .	1
this lens wonderful starter lens . professional might want little upgrade , but this just right someone starting out .	1
i d200 while all hype around 18-200 others , this one awesome lens portraits other closer up type photos . i read few things i research thought i'd pass my experience : - how this d200 ? ( ans : great . fast auto-focus . no compatibility issues)- you really get crisp photos cool bokeh ? ( ans : absolutely)- 1.8 ok or you need 1.4 ? ( ans : i don't 1.4 but 1.8 so competent price i get crispness shallow dof i looking for)- shooting distance 85mm acceptable or you need 55mm so you closer subject ? ( ans : i really like shooting distance 85mm . i really would not less distance me subject)enjoy	1
this original equipment battery charger manufactered canon . performance charger excellent most canon products . price paid comparible non-sale priced items puchased via internet sites . item recieved original packaging , 3 days after placing order , new ( not reconditioned new appearance ) . i am extremely pleased entire purchase process experienced , information given site ease ordering fast shipping	1
i really like this lens but my results not consistent . i think though this more function my limited skill photography . focal range seems very narrow but when you hit it results outstanding . i occasionally get images out focus but again i think this my fault . i bought this macro work but i use it prime lens most time	1
i never thought $250 lens could so good . i trying buy lenses light-weight my 20d , due neck injury problem , this 50mm fits bill . great low light , agree also , bokeh sweet . i alot bee chasing manage some great macros bees flight this one . all hand held . also take great indoor shots without flash , steady hand . i chose it also because it one least expensive high rated canon 50mm . it goes well inexpensive canon lens , 55-200mm ef 4.5 - 5.6 ii , which also well outdoors , including macro . i am very pleased both , wouldn't part them	1
i picked up canon 350d while i italy . i thinking upgrade camera canon didn't built flash . this flash great , i've only used it few times , but i am more than impressed it functionality . title , i only said " oops " because i think it more flash than i really need , least this camera . overall , i am more than impressed this flash	1
i hesitated year upgrade 550 580 because , paper , i not see much advantage . fact , 580 worthwhile upgrade . i like new dial back adjusting exposure compensation , etc . catchlight screen nice touch but biggest advantages incredibly fast recycling time smailler size . i machine gun my 1ds2 this flash keeps up . 550 could not . it small enough not overwhelm my little rebel too . i note there some vignetting 24mm direct flash unless i drop wide lens screen . manual says ths not happen but it . not big deal since i use gary fong diffuser or bounce flash almost always	1
i'm very happy my speedlite 580ex , new dimension my photographic hobb	1
i bought this camera february , it really great job so many different situations . unfortunately , i lost it this past september kicking myself ever since . i purchasing exact same camera again . excellent features include : easy usesmallgood quality ( long they aren't extremely close ) picturesi like software came cameragood accessories , esp . camera caseclear lcd screengreat options picture takinggood features include : fast shutter speed , although not quite fast enough . i'd like take more pictures faster repetition but cannot this camerai recommended this camera my best friend who lighting designer retail spaces ( dolce gabbana , instance ) he gives it excellent review well , so i know it good all types light professional purposes	1
i like picture quality features this camera this price point so much , its third one i've purchased . my family seems hard cameras such this model only seems last year or so . point its banged around my wifes purse or accidentally dropped kids telescoping mechanism lens stops working . doing web research it seems common problem . so if you're typically more gentle than me my family seem , this great easy picture taker	1
this my lens handheld images birds flight . it sharp exhibits no color fringing or other chromatic aberration . comparison , my leitz 400mm f/ 6.8 telyt shows fair amount color fringing outside center region . fair , telyt much simpler design . telyt higher contrast than ef 400mm f/4 , but levels layer photoshop fix . 400mm f/4 much lighter than any 400mm f/4 lens conventional optics . lenses diffraction element compensates color dispersion spherical lens elements . it also reduces optical complexity size . f/4 speed makes autofocus faster , allows even better isolation subjects using narrow depth field . while bigger heavier than canon 400mm f/ 5.6 , f/4 lens light enough 4.3 pounds it still easy carry . i've used mine hikes above 10,000 feet photograph bighorn sheep . definitely makes difference handheld , tripod below 1/125 second . canon 400mm f/ 5.6 non-stabilized lens . i've taken some my sharpest wildlife images this lens - you see every feather some bird shots . highly recommended if you afford one .	1
my kit includes canon d60 dslr , tamron 28-75mm f/ 2.8 , canon ef 100mm f/ 2.8 macro usm , sigma 100-300mm f/4 , 420 ex speedlite flash , 4 assorted filters , aaa batteries , 2 extra batteries d60 tripod collar . first few times i tried fit everything , my sigma 100-300 not find space . i return this bag , but tonight , decided give it try ( 10th attempt ) . surprise , surprise ... best configuration just came me all sudden . sigma lens bottom , stretched out occupy width bag , 100mm flash fits perfectly remaining part bag bottom . then , divider top , prevent scratching , place d60 tamron lens attached top , height bag makes it easily possible fit everything , close hood , without stretching bag all . my 4 filters ( jn their think cases go into front pouch . generous side-pockets fit my tripod collar 100-300 , 2 spare batteries , new box 12 aaa batteries .... this means my entire kit fits perfectly , without bag stretched uncomfortably . i'm glad i gave it this one try	1
i enjoy i get closer shot now . its quality good . i am happy purchas	1
it easy attach -- detach -- works well most ( but not all ) my 58mm lens . it cut down glare , let face it , hood makes your lens look bit more dynamic , while also protecting it elements	1
i bought this hood after reading elsewhere it fits 50mm f/ 1.8 mark i ( version metal mount distance scale ) i purchased recently . canon specs discontinued es-65 hood this lens . great thing this et-65iii it longer , so it blocks more stray light without vignetting full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs . interior this mark iii version also flocked , providing bit more light absorption . i've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while college , but this hood definitely worth investment : well built , fits backward lens storage ( but too long while lens camera ) , provides good protection front lens ( it quite deep ) . note this not fit newer 50mm f/ 1.8 mark ii version ( all plastic mount no distance scale )	1
kodak ph160 media cartridge kit best bargain around ! you get 4 cartridges plus paper each pack . i used more paper than ink ! thank you kodak such money saving kit	1
i purchased this camera year ago ( summer 05 ) . definitely great upgrade over original rebel , although new xti larger screen which one aspect this camera not perfect . there other sites perform more comprehensive reviews this camera , but after year mine still working perfectly	1
it extremely easy use . hard figure out menu , but once there no problem . takes beautiful pictures . great action shots well . seldom find blurry photo it stabelizer built	1
it not best looking remote you'll ever find but design made practical fit strap . you'll never lose this remote it works like charm	1
good remote . finnicky times if not lined up correctly camera	1
i am lifelong photographer i purchased this camera january . i taken it several major trips . it wonderful performer . i many 11x14 enlargements i received terrific feedback . quality this camera cannon optics not disappoint . price right now replacement out .	1
impressive feature list wih affordable price , serious ameteur . i've using 20d 18-55 , 50mm 1.8 , 35-80 , 80-200 500/1000mm lenses . i am not disappointed . i am planning upgrade series lenses but slowly . i not mean over entusiastic canon , but i am yet see nikon camera same specs same or ever near equal price . i've got fm10 film photography . i love both my cameras . impressive features include : mirror lockupiso 3200 noise reduction18 custom functionsaccepts entire series canon lens . heavy metal body ( no cheap plastic feel	1
i bought this camera 2 months before my son born . i knew little digital slrs , but after research i found this one me . this camera well constructed durable . pictures excellent . i blown few my pictures up 11x17 without any problem . also , if you going doing any editing photos your computer , this camera would great . i would recommend purchasing newest version photoshop or photoshop elements ( when i bought mine it only came elements 2.0 3.0 already market ) . also , if you want your pictures turn out , you must purchase larger flash . onboard flash weak , leave shadows it not allow you any type " bounce " flash . whole , this best camera i ever my life it would great anyone who previous experience slr cameras .	1
owned distortion-prone nikkor afs 17-35 2.8 six years , it time switch over canon ef 17-40 mm f4l usm . canon version over $1000 cheaper , optically superior lighter weight . me , outstanding standard lens when coupled canon 5d . vignetting f4 minimal . adobe photoshop cs2 vignetting tool correct vignetting . distortion 17mm minimal . less than canon ef 16-35 mm 2.8 usm set 16 mm . 5d pointed blue sky , ef 17-40 hunted focus point while ef 16-35 didn't . flaring minimal when compared ef 16-35 . portraits taken 40 mm produced better results than ef 16-35 afs 17-35 35 mm . images produced f4 sharp . f8 , images very sharp . this lens definite keeper .	1
i purchased this speedlight my d70s . it easy take out box fire up . but it capable lot more than your standard portraiture vacation shots . i using this unit in-store photography it worked wonders . included filters help balance out horrific fluorescent lighting found most stores . while it highly intuitive , i also control it outpu t.t his essential part any nikon package	1
here my point . when you buy digital slr , most likely couple years there newer model available some better features same price . but lenses well flashes not changing fast keep value much longer . so purely financial prospective , it always better invest more long lasting lenses flashes less dslr body . point . most people don't need all advanced feature modern flashes probably easily survive without them . but also almost everyone sooner or later finds him/herself situation , when place just too dark too big . so it more likely you'll need just more raw power then any advanced features . so bottom line , since general purpose flash usually long term investment , if you choice , try get most powerful one	1
just bought my first slr ( d50 ) my first external flash ( sb-800 af ) . i didn't know what expect , but i amazed ! i could take flash into very dark ( mostly candle lit ) large ( 40'x65 ' ) room take shot looked like daylight . far speed , its amazing - i shoot off 12 shots continuous mode my camera flash keep up ( sometimes it miss shot or two - still trying figure one out ) . so far , i couldn't more pleased	1
i bought this flash hoping improve my indoor pictures my rebel xt . amazingly , i find absolutely no difference using built flash camera or this unit . i find pictures taken very reasonable distance ( 8-10 feet ) under-exposed unless i correct exposure using menu . would curious if more expensive units including 430ex better , but i cannot recommend this one	1
first off , this lens works wonderfully canon 20d , 30d 5d . image stabilization gives photographer serious edge . my experience , when active , i'm able shoot much lower speed , without any blurring . throughout range lens , image sharpness excellent , although little soft when you zoom near 300 . otherwise , 75 280 aprox . image quality astonishing . i shot weddings , sport events , low-light conditions very cold climate conditions lens performed flawlessly . ability focussing manually plus . automatic focus always accurate . just few times more than 3000 shots lens slowed bit when focusing , but i must say objets moving . weight lens ok , not too heavy , construction seems according canon standards . when shooting particular situations , silent usm mechanism really welcome feature . overall , very nice lens serious amateur photographer	1
this lens gotten some bad reviews , i think , partly because it starting show it age . this first usm lens , technology really grown since then . if canon come updated 75-300 usm lens , man , it would blow everything away . said , yes , this lens little slow focus . but , if you not using it work like one professional sports photographers you see sidelines baseball games , you should okay . it also could use extra stop ( or two , or three ! ) because when you handholding , you need aperture open it . all this aside , i really gotten some gems pictures out this lens . it lets you get closer then you possibly could hope . if you asteady hand plently availible light , you get some really nice shots . if you low light situation ... you need tripod . lens works ... pretty good , but i number ever so slightly blurry pictures wouldn't there some more aperature room play . all all , its good starter telephoto lens , especially digital slrs since it really extends zoom those . its great price , when you decide upgrade one those white canon beauties , just sell it	1
i shoot canon 20d used canon ef 75-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 iii usm lens . i've always noticed limitations this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed lens lineup canon website decided canon ef 100-400mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 usm lens . 100-400mm great lens , but it bit soft . reason i decided add canon ef 70-200mm 2.8 /f usm telephoto zoom lens my lens collection . lens , there numerous features its manufactured high quality materials higher level dust moisture resistance compared standard line lenses . this pro quality lens meant serious photographers . construction sturdy consists 23 elements 18 groups . four super ud-glass elements largely eliminate secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration . improved 8-blade circular aperture offers more pleasing out-of-focus image . canon ef 70-200mm lens weighs 3.24 lbs/ 1,470 , accepts 77mm filters minimal focusing distance 4.3 ft/ 1.3 . this lens compatible extenders 1.4 ii 2x ii . sure get good quality uv haze filter protect front lens element . white , this lens looks bit strange , but helps keep it stay cool when shooting sun . some people concerned white , it attracts attention criminals . my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless what lens i put it . addition , i most likely camera bag tripod/monopod me further attract attention . i personally doubt thief looking something steal taking time evaluate cost item more concerned ease taking something they unload . i try make things difficult would thieves insurance back up . dual system two modes . mode 1 stationary subjects while mode two moving subjects . it recommended function not used tripod ; however i used it my monopod success . helps eliminate camera shake helps stabilize lens when shooting moving vehicle . while there limitations what , it give you few extra stops . just keep mind , attempts eliminate camera movement , not movement subject photographed . this lens permits auto or manual focus depending how switch set . there also switch shift 1.4 m/ 4.6 ft infinity or 2.5 m/ 8.2 ft infinity . included this lens tripod mount , lens hood , storage case . tripod mount best option use when mounting tripod . this helps balance load . mounting camera instead creates unbalanced set up may topple over . case zippered soft case ( lz1324 ) also purchased separately . lens hood ( et-86 ) used reduce lens flare protect front element certain situations . often times , amazon recommends purchasing lens case hood , however they normally included lens . canon ef 70-200mm such awesome lens , it almost fails compare canon ef 75-300mm . canon 100-400mm lens well used option me , but clarity sharpness 70-200mm lens more refined . auto-focus quiet quick . this lens used portraits , landscape , sports or general walk lens . f/ 2.8 combined makes this good option certain low light situations . features add creative versatility . canon ef 70-200mm lens comes price , but it worth every bit it . pros : incredible clarity sharpness quiet quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual system cons : heavy bulky ( this should expected these types lenses	1
i read reviews this lens no one anything bad say it . it fast , crisp , focuses fast , quiet , solid bit heavy . weight vastly compensated all positive features . i used it my 20d just amazed . i just purchased 5d cannot believe my eyes . just great great lens	1
i just finished first set pics this machine surprised amazing sharpness accuracy autofocus , not mention deapth field when compared our older canon digital camera . don't fooled low price , however . 16mb card joke , batteries not rechargable . it best get 1gb memory card battery charger pack right away . price still very reasonable such high quality machine	1
i so much fun this lense managed take some pretty incredible pics . i use this lense probably 95% pics . i 10-22mm , 28-300mm , 100-400mm , all which take great pics but this 17-85mm works great general use	1
if you only going buy one lens your 10 , 20 or 30d then buy this lens . i haven't seen better general purpose lens out there . ef-s 17-85mm takes great photos , especially action oriented situation where you need run around lot get variety different shots different distances . some complained lens overpriced . i agree price , it would nice get hood carry bag thrown , but i say canon impeccable warranty service . i got sand inside my lens autofocus quit while i shooting photos military helicopters landing iraq . i got lens repaired shipped back me within 30 days - baghdad middle war . i able speak human tech fairly easily they even replaced something i clearly broke through heavy use wasn't covered under warranty . repaired lens works perfectly . if you're looking reasonable alternative budget try this lens : sigma zoom super wide angle af 17-70mm f/ 2.8 - 4.5 dc macro autofocus lens canon digital slr camerasbear mind if you issues you're using non-canon lenses canon body , support you get canon limited	1
got it two days ago , can't say how much i love it . my camera fits perfectly , i even put my video camera . although it doesn't wheels , i move head around any direction make it stiff easily . i love double extensions legs then neck extensions minor adjustments .	1
i purchased this gift my brother-in-law . he over 6 ft tall wanted tripod he didn't bend over use . i couldn't find one locally , very happy find this one online . he very happy his gift ! highly recommended	1
i bought generic chinese " equivalent " bp-511 battery boasted higher milliamperage rating cheaper price than original canon battery came my camera . battery worked fine 3 months now only holds charge 20 minutes . i it fail critical times . never ever buy some knock-off chinese battery -- read reviews . chinese push out their crappy knock-offs unsuspecting consumers ( like i ) just make quick buck . also , don't trust glowing reviews generic sellers . they self-generated . my case , seller no longer selling under his original company name . he new name requisite ( sham ) glowing reviews . chinese products suck	1
there many after market batteries this camera every review indicates they not effective , this oem battery sony delivers goods , extremely long lasting power handle not only digital picture taking but all additional flash requirements	1
we traded up original rebel xti . this first add-on we purchased great ! battery grip adds some balance overall sturdy-feeling rebel ... especially , slightly smaller xt xti bodies . good stuff , no regrets	1
it shipd fast verygood buy money look same more expensive canon one plus batterys good brand i think but it realy up you buyer ihave canon rebel it fit verrysnug	1
well , it canon , so there no doubt quality . only downside -- because it doesn't string cap very easy misplace . always put it your pocket everytime you remove it camera shoot pictures	1
i got this lens cap when i ordered close-up lens my camera , powershot s1 , because it recommended something people who ordered part would also order . i , therefore , assumed it went same camera , or lens/adapter i ordering . however , it not appear fit either camera itself or any attachments , so i now wish i some more research determine whether it would actually fit my equipment	1
i previously owned kodak easy share died while i vacation . i loved easy learn use features camera so i wanted camera easy non-professional use . this little camera great ! i've it few months now love pictures ! it very easy use super small which makes it easy throw my purse take anywhere . pictures crisp clear battery lasts forever . my old kodak used take real aa batteries i thought camera its own little rechargeable battery might strange but it actually much easier lasts way longer than aa my old kodak . lcd screen huge makes it very easy review photos . just one little click go review back taking photos . only two downfalls i've found so far little setting dial moves easily its own so you always check it before taking picture or it might some strange setting or video . other thing i haven't able figure out if there way delete all photos camera after you upload them - i've delete them one one which slow process . other than those two little things this camera wonderful ! highly recommended	1
this outstanding camera it size . easy use , easy carry produces great pictures . would recommend anyone who ready give up film go digital	1
this camera excellent one !! really when you compare its price its results level quality you get you know why this best its category , i'm getting very professional results using it lot styles .. highly recommended	1
when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
strong rigid , easy control head so you it loose free movement but tight enough camera doesn't flop over . opens closes very easily . it kind expensive $50 but its probably worth money	1
i very pleased amazons quick delivery my new canon monopod . monopod very easy adjust use . it ideal ridgid support you would want your camera . it even doubles great walking stick , sometime need , those long treks you make get good photo	1
... there two things you should know . first f/ 2.8 version this lens big heavy . second f/ 2.8 version this lens more versatile , therefore , more useful two choices . why f/ 2.8 more useful ? it allows you use canon outstanding extenders still sharp practical lens . 1.4 , you very , very good 98-280mm f/4 lens . 2x , you good 140-400mm f/ 5.6 lens . both cases lens autofocus -- very well 1.4 adequately 2x . use canon extenders also allows 70-200 make pretty nice close-up lens . original close focus lens maintained extenders , giving you both 280mm 400mm focal lengths focus closer than most prime lenses same focal lengths . while you use extenders f/4 version , it makes some pretty slow lenses limited applications . there not much you say this lens hasn't already said . it one sharpest zooms around look , while certainly subjective , highly appealing . i preference prime lenses over zooms but i still rank this one my sharpest lenses . there any reason choose 70-200 f/4 lens over this one ? cost aside , i see valid argument made f/4 . carrying around f/ 2.8 full camera bag no fun unless you're putting it use . since i mostly use shorter focal length prime lenses , sometimes f/ 2.8 pain neck me -- literally . unless i know i need it , i taken leaving it behind favor lighter , smaller less sharp canon 100-300 . so i see utility smaller 70-200 . maybe i talk myself into owning both . nah , that little too excessive .	1
this lens fantastic very fast . colors blow you away . 2.8 stop set very fast sutter speeds . i put this lens my reble xt i dont want take it off . love it amazon great .........	1
good quality product which actually measured slightly larger than indicated providing room good sized zoom lens . usual amazon shopping beat all others pricing	1
clearly " rkm001 " some difficulty using this equipment . i one i used part my job . i probably cut over 1000 photos/labels/etc . other people office cut more than 2000 photos . it exactly what it supposed - it cuts straight line edge guide . where this problem arises when cutting surface , underneath cutting wheel , becomes worn use . i grove slowly develop since cutting surface not fixed position slide side side , grove not straight nor it parallel cutting guide . solve this problem , you should not use extreme force when cutting . gentle pressure adequate cutting photo . you also remove cutting surface rotate it 90 or even flip it over . this gives you four cutting surfaces work . ultimately you need replace it . carl makes those too . $20 , it works well unless you plan cut thousands times month , it fine home or light office use	1
i am professional photographer , i owned this camera nearly two years . i also d70 backup . batteries go forever , it very quick respond , images beautiful , it typical nikon durability reliability . if you already nikon user , controls fall easily hand . said , computer software this camera joke . best image quality shoot raw files , color balance grey card , render images software like capture one le . uselessness included software only reason this camera gets four instead five stars . come , nikon , real !!! shortly after i got my first d70 , i shot model small photo side bar catalog . i got ugly feeling my gut when i told designer taken shot 3/4 figure , cropped head shoulders , enlarged image cover 8.5 11 catalog . time i found out , it already printer . it turned out , i pleasantly surprised : cover shot looked great . after incident , i trusted this camera always pleased results . this camera better than 35 mm every way except response shutter button . resolution color reproduction it more comparable medium format film camera . it imperative shoot raw process files properly get most out this camera . i can't wait try d80	1
excellent camera kit . versatile . i lot learn camera , though , it no simple point-and-shoot . however , auto mode , it takes great point-and-shoot pictures . i look forward learning how use it fully . lenses came warranty cards , but camera itself not . i bought sb-600 flash well battery two 1 gb compact flash cards round out kit . camera lens attached large , which i underestimated . $80 camera bag too small it all . great camera , though . price best i could find anywhere	1
i similar battery grip my dig rebel , i never took it off camera . so soon i bought 30d , i immediately ordered this . dual batteries allow me entire wedding ( close 1000 shots ) without ever switch batteries . plus it really improves grip camera heavier/longer lenses . it worked very well me , breeze install	1
i'm very happy product would recommend it my friends . your service also excellent	1
got this my 580ex flashes shooting weddings . works great recycle times excellent . it last entire event filled 2500mah batteries	1
i am not professional photographer , but i wanted high quality lenses go my canon 10d ( which i may upgrade soon ) . i researched over month before purchasing this lens , i not disappointed . i only wanted carry around two lenses , so i purchased this one , canon-ef 17-40mm f/4l usm ultrawide zoom lens . i found this combination works very well me . my uses include photographing landscapes , wildlife , sports events , my family . speed quietness autofocus outstanding , zoom doesn't compromise quality prints . even though price high , you really get what you pay lenses .	1
first , i selection third-party lenses . nothing bad , just none spectacular . i somewhat disappointed shots i got . then i bought 85/ 1.8 saw contrast colors i expecting . since then , i've bought several canon lenses this one my latest . like title says , wow . my first shots house around it all apertures zoom lengths , shots simply incredible . just fantastic sharpness - no ps usm needed ! colors real vibrant contrast sharp clear . this ( my 24-105/4l ) what lenses should . well built , solid great glass . sure , you pay more . you could enhance your shots ps . but see results these lenses vs cheaper alternatives , you'll see what you spent all money for!i'm sold canon	1
like many people my decision telephoto zoom lens came down buying canon 70-200mm f/4l or canon 70-300mm f/4- 5.6 usm . trade offs seemed clear first . former performs slightly better ( see canon website mtf data ) , better designed built , faster " " lens status . user comments ratings ( more than one site ) slightly more favorable lens . 70-300mm improved course longer focal length . both cost same so money not factor my decision . i eventually decided lens initially disappointed . photos ranged wonderful not very good all . fact , i almost returned lens . eventually i figured out problem . my yard heavily shaded so most initial photo taken low light i selected shutter speeds too slow . avoid camera shake you need shoot reciprocal focal length or faster . sounds simple but digital rebel xt ( which i using ) you need consider camera 1.6 multiplication factor . so 200mm you need shutter speed 1/320 or faster not 1/200 like i initially thought . once i made speed adjustment things changed better . still i some mixed feelings my decision . when light good this fantastic lens but feature offered 70-300mm i would probably get photos i miss this lens . i can't fault performance this lens its limitations i given it 5 stars . other words it what it supposed very well but my message other buyers consider where you most likely use lens before buying . remember becomes increasingly important you extend focal length . if your camera already extending it factor 1.6 you may find very attractive feature . ( note 70-300mm recall certain model numbers because problems when using lens portrait position . ) way , i purchased amazon it flawless transaction	1
this wonderful lens great image quality , very fast , very good build quality . no complaints	1
when i worked photojournalist many years ago , 50mm " standard " lens it came closest real world perspective , especially street photography . no longer always true because field-of-view crop many cameras . canon popular digital rebel its successors , example , 1.6 view turns 50mm lens into 80mm lens . 1d mark ii 1.3 view makes it 65mm lens . so , if you're looking standard lens today , 35mm probably closer mark those cameras . canon couple options there - 35 f/ 1.4 great expensive 35 f/2 good value $250 . if you're still looking 50mm , however , there now four options canon : 50/ 1.2 , 50/ 1.4 , 50/ 1.8 50/ 2.5 . here pros cons each : 50/ 1.2 newest , fastest most expensive $ 1,600 . it " " lens , which means it more durably constructed than any others . image quality cut above all others , especially wider apertures . if money no object , you'll probably want this one . but most rest us ask question whether it 5x better than 1.4.50 / 1.4 maligned some softness its images f/ 1.4 , but me its good , compact , low-light lens terrific price ($325 ) . lens gets sharp quickly you stop it down . it sharp f/2 very sharp f/ 2.8 good contrast colors . 50/ 1.8 step down 1.4 speed , image quality , build quality smoothness noise its autofocus . but it big step up value - decent lens $80 . if you're just getting into digital photography , this great lens learn until you get better feel lenses you want/need . 50/ 2.5 - this macro lens , although you use it general photography , too . i wouldn't recommend it . if you're doing macro photography , spend little more 100/ 2.8 , which sharper lens gives you more subject distance . if you're looking standard lens , you'll appreciate wider aperture 1.4 . all said , 50mm canon lenses , i think 50/ 1.4 still offers best mix image quality value .	1
this very good product , price cheap , come bag which plus , if you looking cheap but sturdy monpod , this right one , highly recommanded	1
good quality , particularly amazing price . sturdy , well-made , even case nice . pops open second , collapses just easily . keep mind fully collapsed it wider than standard backpack , so if you lash it under backpack it awkward . but strap carrying case makes it easy loop monopod carry it vertically	1
i say excellent purchase . i'm fan my p880 camera . wide angle len , feature included , allows take great panoramic views , no efforts . manual optical zoom great , gives you control picture i never comercial digital camera . one my favorites features zoom reviewing picture , 10x zoom you check detailed picture lcd screen your pc . 8 megapixels , allows you see great precision minimal details usually you don't see . great experience , when you take picture , return home , picture better than your memory . i'm still learning other features , but rigth now i think great performance-value relation , most important , allow my photos professional touch ,. south worldcarolina	1
i bought my camera few months ago , so i chance figure out most its features , not all lol , but i consider good thing ( extra features means more messing around it ^-^ . well anyways it excellent camera , it all things i want it too , its half price rebel . video it takes amazing record till there no space sd card . me i sandisk 1g securememory sd card i take 27 minutes it which plenty . 38 secounds 38mb internal drive . i take 329 pictures 1g sd 10 internal . battery great it , i used it countless hours havent gotten one bar go down , so 2-3 days use run it down . so i asume 8-10 hours . i never it die me , out me intentually letting it ( i guess its better let battery run out then charge it ) focus zoom feature fun play camera comes really handy ( extra zoom there zoom button top left camera , so you really dont need buy one those cameras 10x ) what else ? well manual features ( biggest reason i got camera)so play ap ., iso , shutter speed they so fun mess , even hue photo which i didnt expect like , i actually got off really good shots . auto features come handy too , just click shoot ! macro neat feature , get close its amazing your shots beautiful ! screen good , crowd around me most still see image screen ( i take video my boyfriend friends sparing)the mic top , it its job ( when its windy you actually block wind without even knowing because your hand while " , off-shoot " button covers it ( good design)uploads pic quickly computer deleting picutres extremely quick easy . af ( auto-focus ) , focus , ae easy get quick fixs other then focus front camera . flash good . well i hope my long drawn out review helpful . i hope you enjoy your camera . i shortly purchasing smaller camera v-logs possible canon sd630 . but yes buy kodak p880 mega-pix simply amazing	1
this my favorite lens . i could not carry heavier long range teles , it hard decision me . end , i chose this because it lighter than zooms . previouly used 75-300 zoom , i leary getting 300mm prime , because i may miss 70-300 range shooting . but clarity colors so true this 300 prime , i don't look back . easy handle , not so bulky . fast , impressive photos . even when i add 1.4 teleconverter shooting 500mm range my 20d . i use f4 alot , no problem , great clarity . awesome lens price	1
this real thing . it seems impossible get anywhere i got it overnight amazon . wow	1
i used my new nikon d200 this past weekend renaissance faire high heat , el3e performed like champ ( camera itself ) . i couldn't believe i got through three full days picture-taking ( using fill flash after five pm or so ) one battery charge . i finally ran out juice late third day , after approximately 500 exposures . ( one caveat : i don't use auto-focus . all . ever . so , you know , ymmv .	1
after 3 decades nikon 35mm film ' loyalist ' , co-worker let me test drive his canon 5d , canon ef 16-35mm 2.8 usm sandisk extreme iii 2 gb card . viewing images his lcd computer screen helped me decide sell almost everything nikon ( i kept their sb-800 flash wireless slave setups ) switch established dslr leader , canon . finally , no more heavy bulky nikon f5 pay wait film processing ! no more scanning negatives hours each night!i've owned 5d , canon ef 17-40mm f4l usm , canon ef 70-200mm f4l usm tripod collar canon speedlite 580ex 3 months taken over thousand raw large jpeg images iso ranging 50 3200 . ( note : 4 weeks ago , backup canon digital rebel xt black body added 70-200 . ) 5d image quality stunned every person i given 4 " 6 " 8.5 " x11 " colour monochrome images . credit must given canon digital photo professional ( dpp ) raw processing software , canon i9900 bubblejet printer , canon paper canon ink . i rarely use adobe photoshop cs2 anymore because dpp quick-to-use tools . above 5d any one lenses flash fits nicely into tamrac velocity 7 bag . larger velocity 9 bag fit entire 2 body lenses flash ki t.t he only negative camera closed compact flash card gate moves slightly it hinge giving body less than solid feel . digital rebel xt not this issue therefore feels more solid . built-in flash would nice but not absolutely necessary . unlike superb nikon sb-800 , canon 580ex bit chunky but it job wonderfully . low noise images iso above 800 easily removed dpp or photoshop . photoshop goes step further removing colour artefacts which lowers saturation image . meaning saturation would increased after noise removal . bottom line : if you believe it costs canon more manufacturer full-frame cmos image sensor don't mind spending several months salary 5d , go it ! also , choose your lenses carefully . canon lenses go well 5d .	1
while 5d may less expensive than so-called professional grade , camera more oriented toward pro end than 20d ( or 30d ) fewer dial settings but more capability . others covered some other areas , so i'll try avoid repetition . full frame makes great deal difference me . i like print large images i like use or other higher end canon lenses ( couple knockoffs ) . there no tradeoff weight consequence or compactness . truth i prefer recent glass isn't computed smaller sensor . i liked 20d , lot , most my gear carries over 5d . i now three cameras take same card battery . 5d if anything feels looks more rugged 20d while very compact . but pictures ? great . 20d first rate camera 8.2 its ability use all canon lenses , plus ef-s smaller digital image . one person cited slowness over 20d . i won't disagree , but it isn't big deal me . i typically use drive bracketing fly , but almost never anything just fast sequence , e.g. sports . i've owned motorr drives going back my days pro 60s 70s they their uses . esssential sometimes . but they like autofocus . occasion , you need manual . whenever possible , i prefer single shot or occasion , three shot burst . i find there less chance missing what i'm shooting . " decisive moment " too often falls frames motor driving . but that everyone taste . i really am impressed camera tried it , look forward trip it , trusty 20d second .	1
i use this lens standard my rebel xt rather than 18-55mm lens came camera . it gives much greater flexibility outdoor shoots when i'm capturing my grandsons action soccer field .	1
this lens all i anticipated more . auto focus fast accurate . i gat stunning action shots	1
bought this lens few months back shot volleyball it , occasionally used it football when it got dark . what i say or add other reviews ?? f/ 1.8 great , although lens sharper f/2 or 2.2 . i use it near wide open edge all time - indoor gyms simply not much ligh t.t he usm autofocus great - demoing it store , it seemed nearly anticipate my actions . no rotating front filter , it doesn't protrude , either . it got full time manual focus ring , so i don't worry killing my autofocus motor . combination . fn 4-1 , this killer . why four stars ? chromatic aberration lower apertures . i not know where it starts go away , because i almost never shoot good light . this most apparent shot recent football game . granted , team jerseys white , background pitch black unlit parking lot , i perform 100% crop . nevertheless , alien-like purple halo surrounded huddled offensive team . oh well , you can't it all ! volleyball pics , this lens . i regularly shoot f/ 2.2 , iso 1600 , 1/500 , but i might change soon because pushing it . photos pretty sharp usm definitely helps here . i bought this lens because my 50mm 1.8 just wasn't cutting it - i'd get shots tack sharp background beautifully bokeh'd subject - just opposite what it should . using 85mm removed 85% those shots . there still extreme instances when i swing my camera around instantly shoot when usm can't keep up , but there other instances when i am amazed it got shot focus . sidelines , 85mm too long get outside hitter nearest you , but that why you move around ! shooting volleyball requires strategy . focal length also good my 350d shooting events staying bit back subject . i'm overall pretty pleased lens . i see what many people call this " hidden lens .	1
this lens changed it all me . i happy my tamrons tokinas - i thought . then i bought this lens . colors contrast simply popped out pics . it amazing ! while there no red ring around it , it deserves one . difference shots incredible . it very well built , focuses ( like all canon usm lenses ) fast quiet provides photog truly beautiful bokeh . low light , it awesome . using extension tube macro , it great . portraits , it nearly unbeatable . so what downside ? sure there one : you'll sold canon lenses . since this one , i've bought five more , including two " " series . if that downside , so it ! just buy lens - you'll love it	1
not much add top other reviews . only thing you should aware depth field f/ 1.8 paper thin , which excellent portraits , but requires perfect focussing . bokeh ( structure background blur ) nothing short great , easily competing much more expensive lenses . yes , it " " quality	1
this monopod great job my camera . you quick , easy-off , it attatches your camera screw , you press button side monopod just slide your camera right off it quickly . i wanted nice , inexpensive monopod my new zoom lense . i canon 35mm , i recently purchased 75-300 zoom lense it , i needed monopod stabilize shoot . if i knew then what i know now , i would buy it again . nice product	1
this lens bag fine product but don't fooled into adding it accessory canon 1.4 or 2x extenders . both them come this exact pouch . amazon should remove this " suggested accessory " web pages two products above	1
this cable very essential need me upload my photos computer . i very fortunate find it amazon.co	1
this cable four-point usb connector works some kodak digital cameras . sure your camera uses four point connector before buying this one . many cameras use five point connector . these kodak branded cables high quality fair price	1
why use case when this one built specifically this camera ? i like it , it sleek belt-mountable . also enough padding so you throw it backpack , suitcase , etc	1
i bought this camera when i sophmore college . now , 2 years out college , handfull beautiful days , half-dozen life changing moments , umpteen vacations later it still goes me everywhere snaps photographs . all sticker labels it since knocked off but it doesn't matter because i know what they all . this puppy built last . when i eventually pass this one down family buy new one , i'll getting canon sure . if you're looking high-value digital camera thinks it tank , get canon s100 .	1
i'm sure there those who'd wax philosophical over subject filters how one brand " much better " than , but my canon ef-s 10-22mm 20d , i figure canon would fairly good making filter they're willing branded " canon . " it fits fine , doesn't interfere lens hood , looks clear , seems attenuate nasty ultra-violet part light spectrum perhaps best all , protects front element . what more would one want	1
what wonderful lens !! i'm purely hobby shooter , but i like take nice shots . i took this zoo other day able take fantastic closeups polar bears , even through glass , pick out details butterfly wings . lens not heavy i feared , unlike some zooms it not telescope out under its own weight , so it comfortable enough keep carrying all day . i'm using it canon d60 am nothing but pleased performance so far	1
portraits sporting events , this wonderful multi-purpose lens . prior purchasing lens , i asked buddy mine ( photographer philadelphia flyers , nhl hockey team long time canon user ) if this quality lens . he told me go it it best buy money distortion spherical abberation extremely minimal this lens . truth told , i've never seen ef lens i didn't like	1
this , my very humble opinion , most useful , sharpest , just anything else good you think say , best wide angle lense ever produced anybody , anytime , anywhere . lightning fast that what you want when light low . my gal pal sara i often wandered caribbean islands dawn early light , she into shooting old homes . she particularly likes gingerbread homes marigot , french side st. martin . i swear she must them all her hard drive . it like obsession her this lens aids her passion , feeds into her manic desire try control light . she just loves it since i love her , i gotta love it too . seriously though , i've used lense quite bit myself it keeper if ever there one . you just go wrong canon " " lense , no siree . jack priest , sailor home se	1
let face it . this great lens . but , i want warn you adorama . i highly recommend you choose better vendor . adorama slow . they don't respond emails . they took week ship my lens when they said it stock . their customer service non-existen t.t heir prices no better than anyone else . almost every time i've ordered them they contacted me try sell me more stuff . ( which further delays shipping)a totally unprofessional organization . i one never order them again . good luck if you	1
this hands down sharpest most used lens i own . combination macro capability , relatively fast 2.8 aperature , prime sharpness keeps it my camera more than anything else . i shoot variety subjects macro nature work indoor sports , this lens never lets me down . one major compliments i this lens its versatility ( i disagree many reviews here . ) i continually find 100mm ideal focal length my 1.6 aps-c sensor xt shooting indoor swimming diving competitions . this length allows beautifully tight framing , slightly compressed depth field , shallow focus get amazing portrait shots while eliminating distracting background . speed lens allows me catch swimmers air without using disturbing flash . this imperative because flash photography prohibited start race . apart sports events , lens allows very intimate portraits without subjects face . this performance macro capability truly make this multi-purpose lens . i usually hand hold sports photography good results ( accessory battery grip my xt invaluable this ) , usually use tripod nature still-life situations . if i've one too many cups coffee i'll use monopod during sports events . i wish lens came accessory tripod collar , because it undeniably fairly heavy piece glass , but it not so important i shelled out one yet . i no complaints af , i find switch limit af range away extreme macro very helpful . once you use canon usm lenses , you never buy anything else . large easy use manual focus ring luxury . it allows quick manual override great control when switching manual focus . many situations i don't want carry my large bag me , 100mm my 17-40mm usually cover just everything i need . ( i know my idea if traveling light not taking kitchen sink however . ) this not lens reasons lack some weather resistance level coatings , but don't let dissuade you . it easily outperforms both my zooms sharpness i find it comparable contrast color . level performance price fraction many lenses makes this unbeatable value .	1
this fantastic piece glass . extremely sharp little artifacts . awesome lens i recommend highly . i love going local botanical gardens mounting this baby my 20d . well worth cost . if you dont tripod , buy one	1
when this lens used 1.6 camera body such xt , 20d , or 30d it ends up giving you amazing 288mm macro or you go one step further 1.4 or 2x tc make it 403/576mm super power . course whenever doing this you must either use tripod or flash except blazing light . it little slow focus compared many other lenses canon offers , but since you most likely using manual focus lot time anyway , this not huge drawback . it also gets heavy carry after few hours you people ask you questions both your their cameras . good note parents pretty good keeping small children out your way when you this lens mounted . narrower background compared 60mm or 100mm macro lenses makes cluttered areas easier deal . extra working distance also plus when working wary insects etc . it best use shutter release mirror lockup shutter speeds longer than 1/30 if you want sharp pictures . 60mm macro wins convenience , but absolute clarity improved working distance 180 comes out top	1
i almost didn't buy this camera simply because plastic body ( i'm used praktica mtl3 film camera , which built like tank ) . however , i'm glad i overlooked because camera top-notch terms robust features quality it provides . startup time very quick making adjustments shutter speed aperture intuitive . if you get bundle kit lens , i highly recommend complimenting it very affordable canon ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii lens , especially if you big fan dof lot available-light / low-light photography .	1
i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
dscw100 8.1 great shirt pocket point shoot easy menu directions added features built	1
my sony dscw100 camera small but very functional user friendly , it makes photography easy interesting hobby .	1
i didn't think it would , but this lens winds up my rebel xt most time . lens compact performs well indoors low light - best use autofocus set center point only . 35mm focal length nice general purpose focal length 1.6 crop dslr . this lens sharp 2.0 really sharp 2.5 -f 2.8 . i lot experience test my lenses tripod/mirror lockup , i'm not just saying sharp 2.0 - it sharp . i considered 24mm 2.8 , but 2.8 pretty slow prime wider focal lengths - loses lot low light advantage . i am impressed colors i getting this lens , wasn't really expecting colors so good such low price point - doesn't lens coatings , but canon colors righ t.t he autofocus speed pretty good - not fast ring usm lenses - it little noisy/buzzy . i currently own 7 canon lenses ( 2 ls ) including 4 primes - this 35mm definitely top bang-for-the-buck lens . ( 28-105 3.5 - 4.5 usm zoom - i don't even like zooms)looking low-light prime ? 240 bucks amazon - just it	1
i am starting my career professional photographer , i haven't any problems these filters . they come nice case , easy attach my lenses .	1
this bag easily accomodates my new canon s3 , lens adapter hood , room spare . recently , during trip europe , i also able fit several other items into bag : rechargeable battery charger , ac adapter , outlet adapter , two sets rechargeable batteries , well uv filter , i still room more . i've no doubt wide- tele-converters this camera would also fit , room spare	1
i would rated this bag ***** if it would little bit larger . it fit only slr camera its lens . no aditional space . actually , there some good spots keep your extra flash cards , you extra battery charger . so , if you want move around your slr least two lenses , get bigger one	1
silver , light , sturdy .. carries camera securely neck or belt	1
nothing wrong this battery . personally i would prefer my camera use aa but battery life lithium ion batteries pretty good . no complaints here except price . but necessity made me purchase second one , not because my other one died , just cuz sometimes i need spare	1
we bought this second battery sony w50 digital camera . these batteries , this camera , last long time . spare allows us keep one external charger swap quickly when needed . it original sony product so fits works perfectly	1
it pretty convinient bag . i put canon rebel xt tamron 28-75 lens , canon 70-300 lens external flash inside i still small pocket wallet , keys etc . only drawback this bag , you not put big lenses . canon 70-300 limit . but if you only limited gear collection , you need give it try	1
i just got back vacation . i bad back , it sore . i very happy discover way this bag hangs , i could carry my nikon d-70 one or two extra lens very comfortably . gear super easy access bag provides nice platform changing lenses . i other bags which heft lots gear , they're great travel days occasional big shoot , but if you're looking hike ( separate way carry tripod ) , then this wonderful bag	1
this bag very sturdy padded . description pretty scanty , but i took chance bought it . glad i . bag holds my jvc gr-dvl805u mini dv camcorder , strap , battery , ac adaptor cord , 4 tapes , remote , all connector cables . it kind tight squeeze all those accesories , but bag compact , comfortable , easy carry , camcorder still protected . bag also comes lifetime guarantee against defect . only thing could improved it awkward get camcorder or out bag while carrying it strap over shoulder ; zipper hard reach goes all way around top . that only thing could improved , could considered safety feature , because camcorder certainly won't come out unexpectedly . bag also very durable nice looking . i recommend it	1
i love using it , long exposure , great bulb . cheap cool .	1
i use it my nikon d50 it works promised . i took some long exposure shots it last night they came out crisp . i am also parent i find using remote much easier than setting timer rangling toddler place within limited window time . i recommend this device anyone i find it quite affordable . like most reviewers , i think it would great if it included accessory	1
this lens super-sharp , colors come out vibrant , it two modes , push/pull ( some people don't like , but your zooms super-fast ) . this probably best canon telephoto lens terms focal range . one bit warning ; it not only fairly large made metal ( not plastic ) , but it kind heavy -- while it doesn't weigh 50 pounds , aware it not light . carrying it around when attached camera , you carry equipment lens , not body	1
i bought this lense recently . first i thought it heavy , but once i got used it , i decided it heavy due quality . it big lense , tripod mount very useful , especially balance . you can't but notice quality this lense . function very useful . combine this lense 2x extender , you've effectively got 800mm lense . anyone looking zoom lense , this one seriously consider . sport , function brilliant , wildlife ... well , i go how good this lense . bottom line - well worth buying	1
this wonderful bag photographer wants light weight bag still hold lot lenses or bodies . bag slings around front allowing user easily switch out lenses without unload entire bag or worry dropping expensive lense . also , bag hold lot accessories . i canon rebel xt bodies 3 lenses just camera compartment . flap opens up user when bag your chest memory card holder , but it hold 8 memory cards which huge ! top small pouch where you tuck away larger objects like water bottle or map . all weather bag cover built into bag so you not worry folding it up storing it . bag cover also velcro pulls latches it onto bag so it stays insuring dry environment inside bag . basically this top notch bag get through anything . yes , i actually used bag few trips find it very user friendy reasonable	1
great product . compact , easy use ( took couple trys ) , feels good able put two large digital cameras , four lenses room more . love it	1
this uv filter produces high quality pictures fraction cost many ather brands	1
uv filter standard filters get . tiffen makes good quality filter this just expected . price equilivant other vendors expected i no problems ; ordering simple product came time	1
exceptional images ! i shoot indoors low light due large aperture . lens bit heavy though ! i choose this lens 24-105 f4l lens . i went 24-70 2.8 wider aperture . i no regrets ! i miss additional reach 24-105 f4l lens , but this compromise i willing make . once again , excellent lens	1
i agree all positive reviews this lens . it great lens , give certain silky smooth bokeh 24-105 lacks gives nice bright viewfinder . it couple quirks though--it very heavy so prepared . lens this quality high speed need lot glass there . -when you zoom out wide , it actually gets longer which bit strange . sometimes when you taking group picture you need zoom out bit fit everyone shot , subjects see lens moving towards them think you going closeup . this partially remedied using included hood which masks lens bit always extended .	1
this wonderful filter . clean your front element , place this filter it , now you never think it again . thread fit very good both ends it . canon 67mm cap fits front this filter perfectly . there even slight raised metal lip so cap doesn't sit against filter glass . well engineered , worth money	1
this my first review here . bought marine pack houseboat trip my sony dsc-n1 camera . it very solid feels great . somehow i mistakenly thought before obtaining it touchscreen could still used when camera installed . though that not accurate , good number other functionality retained ( you switch movie/camera/review modes , zoom , etc . ) . it worked very well trip , it took fantastic photos . we even took several movies going down water slides diving into water ( which isn't suggested manuals ) but still everything turned out perfectly . all all , i'd easily recommend this unit	1
great camera , easy use , great movie quality video cam part . bought 4gb sd card it , so photos just endless	1
2 toddlers , i'm type person who likes camera me capture those unexpected moments film . elph cameras ideal this because they're small lightweight . i used 3.2 mp canon elph before this one , i thought 3.2 good until i started using this new one . clarity stability control sd700 great ! downloading photos my computer takes only seconds . i highly recommend this camera	1
worth money every way . sturdy , compact , great pictures , easy use , easy upload images	1
it doesn't get any better this price point . excellent build quality , very easy use , intuitive . optics simply brilliant kit lense ( 135mm ) . went canon rebel film slr which i loved , but when i tried move into xti , there just no comparison xti d80 . you could immediately feel difference quality functionality . auto-clean feature absolute marketing crap canon . cmos shakes off dust , but then where dust go ? bologna feature , not mention flash nearly knocks your eye out when it pops up canon xti . d80 blows it away , it price there nothing out there better . if your market this price point , or relatively close , just go it . you not regret this purchase .	1
i just purchased this camera lens ( lens different set ) it blown me away so far . pictures just incredible . focus , metering , exposure , flash , color balance ... everything perfect so far . i mainly used camera full automatic mode it really shines . its simple point shoot this mode . i used camera difficult lighting situations photos incredible . there no noticeable shutter lag , which very important me . i 6 yo son who goes smiling one moment looking away next . i missed so many photos past due shutter lag , but not problem this camera . feature helps continuous mode . i take 3 pics second up 100 pics then select best . generally i find i get good pic like 10-15 photos . i used serious photo hobbist during days film , but always problems finding darkroom develop my film . darkroom issue shear cost film paying processing made me abandon hobby . but this camera really bringing back excitement this hobby again without trials expense darkroom . only downside this camera price , but this instance , you get what you pay . you might able save buck or two camera , but i wouldn't even try . i can't imagine camera taking better picture . way , i love this lens . 18 55 mm focal length nice every day lens . its much wider angle then you find point shoot cameras , yet you still get close . i 55-200 mm lens well , but i find i use 18-55 lens more . shorter lens great confined spaces , where you can't easily back away subject , its always better move closer your subject than use long lens ( unless you can't safety reasons ) . my only regret waiting so long get dslr camera this quality . it really opened up old hobby me .	1
after way too much time infront pc reading reviews or camera store counter ( damn i sick it ) , this d80 what i chose . bought it 2 weeks ago then went 10 day trip west . after draging it everywhere i not let me down . price its perfect . i'm still working out exactly how make it work its potential aswell fighting understanding other manufacturers camera layouts my head ) work i rebel xt i bought last year i need its compact casing . my brother canon d30 after he progressed xt friend west coast d200 . experience both i still love what i chose . my biggest reason however going again nikon i already n6006 film camera lens my hope i could use its nikkor af 35-105mm this camera give myself more options . after reading lots reviews whether this possible finally taking lens shop i found it worked fine . experience field last 10 days shown it not work seemlessly buy may well me not lens . 2.5 inch lcd sooo much easier read than rebel xt . info read out top much better placed than one above lcd xt ( if obstructed architectural model shoot i can't see through viewfinder myself , i certainly can't see info screen if its below it ) . i didn't go 18-135 end lens there vinyetting issue high end which bothered me . i got great deal same price cameraland new hampshire d80 ( d70s ) 18-70mm tried trusted lens . fab . now need save up wait release 80-300 vr lens thats coming out . would love 80-400 vr but its 3 times price . my hardest time finiding someone it stock , price i wanted pay , set up i wanted who wasn't trying make dodgie deal ( like some those cheap web based places nyc ) . it really hardest part purchase end . i surprised . many people almost reluctant make sale . it wierd . parts hard get too apparently like spare battery very few places 18-135 lens instock either . anyway enjoy your purchase if you choose this camera . i hope it takes many great pictures you .	1
i market buy new camera last year walked into bestbuy alone just browsing . i older eos canon rebel 35mm camera 1992 , i loved camera too . so this my second camera purchase , not sure what i wanted , but i knew what i wanted take pictures . i take this camera everywhere , vacations , visiting friends family , take pictures scenery , sporting events , people . there lot options this camera i don't know how use , but can't wait learn them too . i upgraded my memory card 1 gb so i take lot pictures not worry running out room . when i travel or go sporting event , i take anywhere 75 200 piictures . i get lot compliments camera photos it takes great	1
this camera all canon says it . fantastic pictures . great flexibility manual control or simple point-and-shoot use . i lot research before buying , i could not happier canon g6	1
i would highly recommend buying canon battery over after-market brand . i bought two non canon batteriesfor my powershot s30 both failed last long original canon battery	1
i canon zr700 camera , it comes one this batteries . since it just giving me little more than hour recording , i felt i needed extra battery . when i saw options , because high price this product , i felt tempted buy oem battery that cost 16.00 usd shipping it good reviews other customers . but them i found canon bp-2l14 here amazon , which gives twice power only 56.00 usd , just 13.00 usd double power original product ( double size too , only bad thing it , but it really not much )	1
i received lenses they all good quality . case comes them also very nice . i worried polarizing lens not working after reading other reviews , but mine worked fine .	1
these great filters especially price ! i looking just one uv filter , after stumbling upon this set which not much more than price one filter , i bought it . these great lenses . i especially like polarizing filter , but all 3 great . definitely worthy buy	1
just what i expected , since this second one i purchased . i one , bought camera this case my daughter . case protects camera lcd screen , but still small enough fit pocket or easily purse	1
this case freaking awesome . i completely turned off 8 dollars shipping i pay , but it definetly worth it . this case looks so nice , so sleek , so beautiful it just feels good your hands . u love this case . i . borrow dollar 8 ppl if u just shipping	1
need clean your digital slr sensor ? this besy way it -- conjunction wtih sensor swabs -- canned compressed air add " junk " which make your sensor worse	1
just use this protect lens . good cheap alternative scratched lens	1
this camera very slim like canon elphs but costs much less . it very high resolution easy use . battery lasts long time 2.5 " lcd screen very clear big . it lot different shooting modes , including custom mode where you set specific parameters like infinity lock or iso speed . convenience , every time you switch modes , screen tells you what mode should used , so you don't need carry around manual figure out how shoot your pictures .	1
we really like this camera ! it whole lot better than our previous one , which ran off 4 aa batteries , ran through so many aa batteries so quickly we can't even guess how many $$ wasted . this optio camera uses very nice rechargable batteries cost $5 each through ebay ( don't buy them here amazon ... ouch ! ) we've got 3 batteries getting two more so we never even worry power while long trip . ( really handy travel charger also awesome ... get it ebay just few bucks . ) startup time shutter speed very fast , so catching quick pictures finally possible us . ( my wife no longer threatens go back film after using this camera ! ) our last camera would take so long focus we never got candid shots we wanted . one only thing that even slight problem this camera power button next shutter button . ( what clueless engineer thought would good ?? ) however , now we've used it lot , we never hit button accident . all other features camera great . 1 gb memory card , we've never ever run out memory space , even taking lots short videos many many pictures medium quality . great camera , worth every cent . buy accessories ebay you'll find getting everything you need not very expensive all . ( actually , we bought camera ebay too , but these reviews great here amazon . thanks , amazon !	1
i hear lot grumbling camera not " perfect . " but guess what ... this size form factor one should not expecting slr-like performance . i just purchased this camera last week busy testing it out variety situations . " full auto " mode pretty decent job figuring out right settings most situations . if you want you take total control set most controls manually . there even bunch pre-programmed setting different lighting situations couple i tested worked great . all all , great camera size . i like fact i put this my shirt pocket forget it then when i suddenly need take picture i always camera handy . i normal speed sd memory card writing out images card painfully slow . this especially true when trying take number quick shots rapid succession . wait camera become ready take next shot annoying . i would highly recommend you purchase one high speed sd cards ( often advertised " ultra ii " or " 32x " or " high speed . " all all great camera if you realistic your expectations you very happy . good luck	1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shapped three three quarters inch long offers some protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . there nothing more irritating than reviewing your images find dust spots or other flaws . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing or replacing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 70-200mm f/ 2.8 ef lens normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . fortunately canon provides storage case lens used addition your camera bag . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store len	1
i'm really pleased this bag , it holds all my gear room spare . there enough adjustable straps fine tune bag your comfort level . it stays nice tight against my back doesn't feel like burden all . this great value compared some other options . only drawback this bag there isn't convenient way grabbing your camera without taking bag off opening it up . other than , no faults	1
i needed camera bag greater portability , comfort , security athletic venues well outdoors ( i.e. mountains , valleys , trails , etc . ) this bag delivered . i fit my two primary lenses , telephoto , external flash , colapsing tripod my camera room spare . i even attach my monopod side if needed . i like pockets so extra internal zipper pockets plus exterior side front pockets great tucking away all extras too ; like lense cleaning suplies , batteries , memory cards . backing shoulder straps nicely padded so it wears comfortably well . when i purchased backpack i planned only use it more " active outings " but since found myself using it place my original camera bag	1
i am thrilled this lens capabilities pictures it . i test shot corner window determine if it would good my insect shots i like so well . i bought this add-on converter am thrilled added this 50mm lens these necessary items my set-up . i like nature photography best like use my off summer days hiking finding photographs take perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles subjects what i like specialize . this lens greatly enhance your experience ' little world ' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away . i built diffuser using ping-pong ball over flash so lighting would work better . ( works great , btw ) . usual , it great canon glass trick .	1
i rebel xt 8 lenses thinking getting upgraded second camera body . so when it came out 30d logical choice , but it not really much upgrade 20d , which i resisted , so i not really sure what . then i all but decided just take plunge get 30d when i heard first rumblings xti . then i started learn details xti , more mega pixels , same auto focus , same screen , picture styles , dust cleaning ! only areas 30d won my opinion build quality , spot meter , estimated shutter life . those 3 categories not enough convince me 30d worth $300-$400 more than xti especially since xti won or tied most categories . way i look it camera bodies not nearly important lenses , they change so fast it not worth it me spend more longevity when it outdated year anyway . spend $ 1,500 lens , use it lifetime , spend $ 1,500 camera body , regret it year . i fully expect upgrade 30d released within year , now i saved getting xti i all much more put towards it when it comes out . so basically what i am saying , my opinion , xti just good , if not better than semi-pro 30d , so why pay more ? switching xt xti very simple , i use them both now without any problems . batteries , battery grips , remote shutter release , most other accessories also compatible both , which nice keep amount gear you need carry minimum . unless you want move up full frame sensor , i can't see any reasons why you would not want go this camera . if you read books photography just 1 or 2 years ago you realize this " entry level " camera features not even available top line ($ 5,000 +) camera bodies . speed camera bodies advance you might well buy entry level body every year instead making huge investment pro level bodies then shown up something 10% price year or two . not there not reasons buy one those bodies , i just don't seem any them	1
i've considered other , higher priced digital slrs , such nikon d80 canon 30d . however , i decided i probably won't using some more advanced features offered those cameras , would rather spend money saved better lens . terms picture quality , all these slrs capable equivalent quality . currently i 3 lenses , kit 18-55mm , 50mm f/ 1.8 , 85mm f/ 1.8 . i don't use kit zoom lens anymore because i favor faster , prime lenses . i mostly take pictures my children , 85mm f/ 1.8 excellent portrait lens . it sharp , fast , produces beautiful background blur . zoom lenses unfortunately not sharp or fast , unless you're willing pay much more than cost camera body . i think all novice slr owners should buy cheap canon 50mm f/ 1.8 , discover what fast lens when you set aperture 1.8 , take some portraits . you too professional-looking results	1
i got this lens complement my 10-22mm 100-400mm lenses . it great general purpose lens ( not too wide , not too narrow ) everyday walk around shooting . image stabilization constant aperture nice features . it also weather sealed so you don't worry elements much most other lenses , course you would need weather sealed camera body completely safe , but it still makes me feel little better sandy or snowy conditions . i use this rebel xt rebel xti which 1.6 crop bodies make this closer 38-168mm which useful portrait work , landscapes , large animals , or somewhat close macro . course there lenses all these things better , but get this all one package really valuable . after all you less likely miss shot if you 1 versatile lens vs . 5 really great specialized lenses ( not you shouldn't get those too , but this good all around contender . ) i posted few photo examples above show range colors versatility this lens . it not sharpest lens i , nor fastest , but it one my camera most often unless i am going out shoot something specific . if you don't want spend quite much , 28-135mm also very good lens	1
this great range use every day walk around lens . it very versatile , light produces great image sharpness throughout range . there bit vignetting wide end , which i actually like . however , f4 , this lens simply not fast enough me . i shoot lot images where i want out focus areas ( bokeh ) glassy smooth ( weddings , portraits such ) you cannot get this lens good you 24-70 2.8 . 24-105 f4 lens image stabilization which help you hand hold get shot lower light situations , but there not much get super smooth bokeh it . if you zoom all way , your dof low pretty darn smooth though my case , i just prefer look bokeh 24-70 overall rather than this lens . although 24-70 super heavy weight compared 24-105 . but i'm professional photographer so while my needs likes geared towards preferring 24-70 2.8 , this doesn't mean 24-105 isn't ideal many if not most .	1
if you don't want get hooked canon series lens , not buy this one . i made mistake buying one now all i want canon lens . it super sharp , contrast saturation fantastic . no need retouch any your photos . so far , i've used it candid shots my kids dance gigs . f/ 2.0 helps lot get right shutter speed freeze action . very good buy . i got mine here amazon	1
this lens best its class . i wish every lens i this sharp . this thing top notch	1
lowepro case 4 great case long telephoto . it well padded , well-built protects lens very well . however , i tried use it small lowepro rezo 190 aw found ( even using sliplock attachment ) it completely unbalanced bag . it so uncomfortable unpredictable , i finally gave up bought lowepro aw magnum ( where all gear i use fits inside bag ) replace both . i now just use case 4 storage purposes or bring telephoto car when i'm " hand-carrying " . i believe it would work much better attachment medium size bag where lens case could hung other side bag better balance weight	1
i'm very happy this lens . it offer ample variety options , high image quality it light	1
this lens truly ' must ' if you don't lots cash spend . simply put , it excellent performer money . i recently got this lens my rebel xt , noticed huge improvement over 18-55mm kit lens . sharpness improved considerably . 18-55mm some serious issues area . first all , sharpness really bad large apertures . but smaller apertures not really much better . 28-105mm still not best performer large apertures . but it much better than 18-55mm . however , around f8 or higher , 28-105mm tack sharp . addition , this lens not suffer problem clear foreground soft background my 18-55mm suffers . color accuracy also greatly improved 28-105mm . colors look much more natural this lens than 18-55mm lens . this particularly true lighter colors , especially when you go increase saturation photoshop ( or other software ) . increasing saturation improve appearance dark colors picture taken 18-55mm would typically make lighter colored objects look very unnatural . this sort problem much reduced 28-105mm . i should also say this lens appears overexpose somewhat compared 18-55mm . this more good than bad , however , it effect making lens faster . course , this lens not without its drawbacks . i mentioned slight softness large apertures , instance . also , it not fastest lens out there . but then again , what you expect price ? finally , 28mm not exactly wide angle cropped sensor digital slr like rebels or 20d . but despite these drawbacks , this lens really performs like champ . when used its element ( ie higher f-numbers ) , it works quite well . also , since it not ef-s lens , it not become paperweight should you decide upgrade 5d .	1
well i too recieved " grey market " version product , international warranty only . this mentioned before , apparently rectified amazon , i hope i'll recieve same treatment . but this still troubles me . amazon continuing sell off cheaper merchandise , only addressing issue individual basis when people complain ? what grey market means product originally intended sale outside us , but imported because version product cheaper than version intended us sale . while it legitimate enough process , they should telling us if they it , because warranty invalidated sold outside boundaries system canon put place . i'm not even touching hardware until i find out what going it , so i can't rate its quality .. but i no doubt it quality piece hardware , i've never heard anyone anything bad say it , except its price , gripe i totally agree . let face it folks , if it wasn't proprietary accessory high priced camera system , it should really cost $20 . it just simple programmable timer no more sophisticated than most wristwatches	1
i enjoy tc80n3 . you may think it costly , but features out standing . i think it worth buy . only disappointment i there no " , off " power switch	1
it works great - no touching sensor brush . great produc	1
i bought this gizmo clear cmos detector my digital slr camera . it seemed like good alternative using specialized , expensive sensor wipes , it would not invalidate camera warranty . results my camera good but not perfect . many large particles dust blown off detector . however , some medium-sized particles merely pushed edges . nonetheless , i really like air blaster just my camera . aside my camera , i used this number other devices around my home office . it works particularly well clearing dust out vents my laptop underneath keys my laptop keyboard . however , it works poorly clearing out dust grime my desktop keyboard . summary , i would say this good device owners digital slr cameras , although it not perfect substitute sensor wipes . owners electronic equipment general , this clever device works reasonably well cleaning dust out some places	1
this absolute do-everything flash , master/slave operation , wireless control multiple channels slave flashes , : : lighting ratio control ( better than st-e2 mere : ratio ) , full manual or automatic operation , strobe effects selectable herz rates power , even small panel serves either widen its flash coverage 17mm or simply provide catchlight model eyes when using bounce flash . range excellent , battery life very good compounded one battery packs . light itself provides excellent color , red lamp near base adds much more accurate less harsh focus assist lamp than most canon cameras provide . if you slr , you'll almost certainly want external flash . you provide fill flash reduce shadows subjects eyes etc . during harsh daylight shots , take flash off camera eliminate nasty shadows , avoid shadows caused larger lenses onboard flashes . minor quibbles : most dslrs crop ratios 1.3 or 1.6 , but don't pass this information 550ex , which wouldn't care anyway . this means flash thinks you want greater coverage than you really need ( i.e. it give you 50mm angle flash coverage , when you only need 80mm ) , so you waste lot flash power don't get optimum recycling times . also , interface little non-intuitive . if you want slave- or onboard-only flash don't need all extra features , considerably cheaper 420ex you . said , if you want all extra features , 550ex still not you . you want 580ex , slated october 2004 release , which fixes minor issues 550	1
i got this camera back may lost it ( but this camera seemed best ) . i ordered same camera amazon but return it because one pixels blown . i got my replacement but amount time it takes take picture eternity . look some other camera . if people posing you better hope you get it 1st shot , because if you don't it takes too long take .	-1
camera perfect solution someone who not want exchangable lensesand some items more professional results . combined direct photo printer it easy fun plenty photo options dial . my only problem i not receive camera software alllow me download computer memory chip itself . there any way get this software	1
... it diffuses light energy flash different directions , essentially turning flash into point light source . light going off different directions then bounces off nearby objects fill shadow areas subject , making more pleasing softer look , especially people . note caution : because this device diffuses light flash , it takes much more energy per flash . using stofen drain your battery much quicker ( 4x my experience ) it takes flash much longer fully charge after each shot , say 8-10 seconds vs 2-3s . always keep spare set flash batteries you . note ... because it requires bouncing light nearby objects effective , using this outdoors not recommended . you're better off removing omni-bounce aiming flash directly subject ( living harsh lighting ) .	1
this isn't full review but some thoughts i've after using it long time . stabilization- fact if this camera you take everywhere you , you going either lose shots or use flash . if flash doesn't bother you , no sweat . but i've never like look it . ease-of-use- great . voice memo- i use this feature all time . it would nice if it pause button because without it i end up many small files . ex- this where you set exposure . casio great job putting everything one place . only thing they should better if you changed selection ( e.g. iso 200 400 ) hit shutter release it should take shot . instead nothing happens . you click set first . it extra step you make during critical time	1
i spent weekend researching digital cameras , exhausting confusing , so many choose , when i store looking various cameras , customer just started telling me how much he loved this camera he just bought , which this one ; i assumed it ' sign ' . it . small size fantastic , put your shirt pocket or purse , almost weightless . quick shutter takes best pictures new baby grandchild any camera anyone family used . ( others sony canon digital cameras ) movies excellent . quality color images perfect , not too over-digitized some said . everyone family thinks i'm wonderful photographer , but it not me , it this camera . battery life really long , it take good pictures multiple types poor visibility situations . first month , i dropped it few times , once sidewalk it survived which impressive . viewfinder big advantage bright sunlight . after using loving it 9 months , telephoto froze . i sent it back casio , they fixed it ; it took 3-4 weeks , which little long , but not charge me repair . baby pictures fantastic , especially because it takes picture so fast , scenery pics all look like national geographic .	1
this lens top notch . quality photographs best i ever experienced camera .	1
new canon ef-s 60mm 2.8 macro usm digital slr lens designed cover entire field digital imaging sensors canon digital slr line , most notably canon eos 20d . this corresponds film normal lens perspective approximately 50mm lens . furthermore it benefits canon usm autofocusing technology , allowing photograher rapid , almost silent , autofocus , which important when working field ( you don't want distract animal you photographing sound lens focused . ) . although this lens not series lens , quality its construction comes close canon premium series professional line lenses . indeed , i read elsewhere excellent test report ( i believe erwin puts website ) this lens praising its optical performance . any canon user digital slrs such eos 20d who interested macro photography regard this lens absolutely essential making great macro images	1
what i say ? it fits place overpriced canon nb3l battery my sd500 lasts longer than oem battery . quality battery external very good . no sloppy glued edges or ill-fitting parts . battery works very well camera lasts longer one hundred or so shots . i use gig card so i tend shot alot once . even flash battery life comparable canon or even longer . i bought two instead single canon battery i not dissappointed	1
i purchased my 300d may 2005 , when xt released this 6.3 mp model price began falling . i'd really pick this camera apart tell you downsides it ; disregard reviews those who think this camera not up par -- course it not comparable eos 1-series or 5d , so don't expect same features or capabilities . right user , however , get similar results . said , unless you professional photographer , i cannot imagine how digital rebel could inadequate any amateur or semi-pro shooter . it speed megapixels since passed , but it still , especially now , great buy . kit lens perform you just fine , although most my shots kit lens 18mm , landscape or just wide-angle shots . flash works very well most situations , even extremely dark rooms . one guy complained his af hunted low light situations , even flash ... course , what you expect dark room ? use manual focus grow up . quality great iso 100-400 , although 800 somewhat ugly times , 1600 basically unusable , especially if you're not shooting f/ 2.8 or bigger . my main complaints : slow start-up time compared newer models ( xt , 20d , etc ) ... camera seems out breath after continuous shooting ; take 8 shots quickly you may notice camera needs process info before it shoot again . 2.5 frames/second not very fast if you're shooting any sports . overall , this camera incredibly reliable me ; it gotten me front page shots newspapers , magazine covers , calendars websites . i used it so much i blew out shutter 10 months ; canon fixed it no charge it works fine since . one minor problem : very rarely , it won't turn unless i remove battery re-insert it . i've found battery life fantastic . i use it all day , even flash , still some life end day . backup battery your bag should give you more than enough insurance day . i've printed 11x17 excellent results . some practice , it very easy navigate . menus options simple ; changing iso or aperture very easy despite what some complained . it very reliable fully-auto mode well , especially if you're shooting flash . memory card reader must when uploading images . overall : it old news world digital slrs , but right now , new or used model such good price really great value	1
i owned canon eos digital rebel 6.3 mp several weeks now love it . fantastic pictures features . i worked slr many years . figured it time " move up " digital slr glad i . this camera plenty features available , or you just set it " auto " works fine , too . though optional flash not needed most photography i wanted one far shots such . canon makes several models dedicated this camera , but i find them weak ( 220ex ) or costly . shop carefully trying find compatible flash . it needs " dedicated " digital rebels . one work af ( auto focus ) or slr ( film ) rebel may not work right . i also received conflicting information ritz camera , both on-line stores . bottom line , if you need flash , shop carefully ask all right questions . personally i held off buying one hoping more models lower price come out . camera already small pop-up flash . btw , tamron af 70-300 macro 1:2 zoom nice lens buy it , priced nicely beach camera	1
manufactured soft gray felt like material , tough leather bottom , draw string closure top , this lens pouch helps protect your lens dust elements . i store my lenses camera bag , these cases fit nicely around lens taking up little precious space . this case meant use canon ef 135mm f/2l usm , ef 24-70mm f/ 2.8 usm , ef 24-105mm f/ 4.0 usm , ef 28-70 f/ 2.8 , ef 50 f/ 1.0 usm , ef 85mm f/ 1.2 usm lenses . these lenses normally come case when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . however if your case worn , replacing it protect your lens recommended . pros : protects your glass investmentcons : i cannot think	1
this camera great photographing artwork . it only camera i could find doesn't bow edges paintings or watercolors ( i think lot cameras lens distors things , but you can't tell until you photograph something supposed rectangular ) . color reproduction also good . if you want camera takes good pictures distant objects , or one higher than 2mp resolution , look camera .	1
there nothing like telephoto bring boats anchor up close when you're halfway up mountain . i got great shot tahiti just way just this lense friend mine used it cover her romance novel . it true lense heavy . canon says it weighs 1.7 pounds , but it seems heavier . no matter though , because you won't go gym if you heft this baby around awhile , side benifit , you'll get crisper , sharper photos then you would any other 200mm out there today . just think it body building photo shooting both same time . also this one won't break your wallet . serously , this one darned fine piece glass , you just simply cannot go wrong canon " " lense , just can'tjack priest , sailor home se	1
many people think this kit lens . it not ! numbers match , but kit lens not usm worth 1/2 price . go canon web site take look lens chart . this lens much faster better glass than kit lens .	1
i chose purchase this lens over standard 18-55 comes kit xt . it functions smoothly seems worth difference definitely upgrade .	1
works great point-and-shoot auto mode . camera just enough advanced features keep novice photographer happy long time . battery life great if you purchase top quality rechargables . large , least 1g sd card , should used . image stabilization works well . tripod necessary if using camera full zoom	1
fairly decent . produces pictures optical blur edges if you use zoom . leaves black semicircle pictures taken flash 1/5 way up bottom picture because flash isn't tall enough miss wide lens . other than .. it capture few more degrees . if you going pick this or telephoto attachment , get this .	1
i compared number pro-sumer cameras became firmly convinced this best camera money . although nikon one time considered premier camera professional , they now take second stage canon not only engineering , but quality lens , innovative user-friendly design , overall quality . i used camera approximately one month delighted . talken pictures over 35 years - including professional - always using minolta equipment all those years , i am truly enamored this canon camera	1
those who truly know digital cameras , more than perhaps 8 megapixels important only if you plan blowing your images up " poster size " , or if you pro who knows how use all those pixels . truthfully , how many you really plan type stuff ? say rebel xti better than 30d because it " more megapixels " " smaller " not best advice . any canon dslr going give you great images , if know how use it . those you who trying decide which camera buy , you really need go camera store ask handle each camera . while you're it , ask yourself how it feels your hands . it too bulky ? it too small hard handle ? it features you want such spot metering , which rebel xti not ? 30d terrific dslr . it all features 99% us need . there reason why it costs more than rebel . 30d better camera overall .	1
these second set filters i purchased i am absolutely love it . i buy new set because my other lense 62mm these 58mm . it produced outstanding colors great quality filters . i would recommend it , price , that how much you would pay polarizer filter alone	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
this great camera , easy use , love quality even best , got this quick amazon prime . highly recommen	1
i bought canon powershot s2 year ago , taken 2,500 photos 15 video clips it . overall , i am very happy it , if i buying new camera today , i probably would get s2 or s3 . things i like s2 : * extended zoom ( 12x ) . i use it often . * image stabilization . particularly helpful when using high zoom factor , or when shooting low light low iso setting . it makes handheld shots slow shutter speeds possible . * electronic viewfinder means " what you see what you get " , just like slr . while not sharp optical viewfinder , ability frame picture without worrying parallax more than makes up it . fact , one advantage over slr there no mirror it move out way , therefore there no mirror noise when taking picture ; if you turn off electronic sound effects , it very quiet indeed ( although not completely silent ) . * screen moves rotates . i like it closed ( turned toward camera ) thus protected scratches . i used it folded out rotated forward order see myself self-timer photo . i used it take " clandestine " pictures -- holding camera down near my waist , i still see screen if i rotate it towards me . i also used it take pictures while holding camera above my head -- above crowd , instance , or over wall . * multiple-picture mode . similar motor drive film cameras , this allows me take several pictures quick succession holding down shutter release button -- 2 pictures per second . unlike some cameras , only limit number pictures amount available memory . * it used all-automatic mode , all-manual mode , or just any combination . even near-automatic mode , several exposure settings adjusted . * very good movie mode . it shoot vga-quality picture ( 640x480 ) 30fps . while results not good my 3-ccd dv video camera , i am much more likely this camera me than video camera , i really like option taking reasonably high quality video . i used it several times . * stereo microphones . decent sound video . also used adding sound memo still picture ( e.g. " this such-and-such place , blah blah blah " ) , or just recording sounds unrelated any picture . i used this couple times record " sound memory " place ; one botanical garden spot where scenery wasn't especially pretty , but sounds frogs made like nothing we heard before ! * separate buttons still pictures movies . easy remember which which . * manual pop-up flash . some people don't like flash doesn't pop up automatically when needed . i actually like this feature , because often i want shoot without flash when camera thinks i need use flash . course i force flash fire even bright daylight when camera thinks it not necessary -- although while i kept forgetting how turn feature , even though it pretty obvious ( there button right next flash ! ) . things i don't like it : * poor low-light performance . more precisely , poor performance high iso settings . camera fine low light if you leave shutter open long enough , or use flash . but if you kick up iso 200 or 400 ( equivalent " fast " film ) so you take indoor shots without flash , you end up very noticeable graininess pictures . this my number one disappointment camera . however , i don't know comparable camera better ( sample pictures i seen , s3 isn't any better ; i don't know why they bothered add iso 800 setting -- it seems completely useless me ) . i know there cameras , but they cost lot more . i saw pictures taken indoors canon 20d slr phenomenal . but besides added expense , camera like also bigger heavier , therefore less convenient . * camera too big pocket . i would love camera capable this would fit my shirt pocket , or least my coat pocket or smallish holster . i would take it more places if it wasn't so big . * yet , same time , it little too small my hand . grip just doesn't feel right . grip 20d felt great ! however , it just right woman hand -- my wife likes it fine . * no filter threads standard configuration . big lens like practically begging fingerprints or scratches . i solved adding conversion lens adapter , which filter threads ( more this below ) . * lens cap held friction . this both pro con . it good because lens extends when camera turned ; if lens cap attached lens simply push it off . it bad because cap could come off when you don't want it . this moot point conversion lens adapter , standard lens cap no longer fit . * default exposure too bright . not every review mentions this , but apparently it fairly common canon cameras . fortunately , this easily fixed setting exposure adjustment ( i set mine -2/3 stop ) . i haven't figured out how adjust exposure movies , though . i need look manual see if it possible ! if you buy s2 ( or s3 ) , i'd suggest also considering : * canon lah-dc20 lens adapter hood set . i mentioned above , this allows you add filter protect lens . currently $37.10 amazon . * 58mm skylight or uv filter screw lens adapter . * 58mm lens cap cover adapter/filter . canon 58mm snap-on lens cap currently $9.99 amazon . * high-speed sd card , least 512mb , but 1gb or 2gb would give more space movies . ( i use sandisk ultra ii plus , which added benefit able directly plug into standard usb port without adapter . ) * rechargeable nimh batteries . i don't any yet , but this next thing my list . i've gone through way too many aa batteries ! nice option available this camera tc-dc58b tele converter lens . this gives you maximum zoom equivalent 648mm 35mm camera . amazing ! i not purchased it yet because so far built-in zoom sufficient my needs . there also wc-dc58a wide converter lens taking extra-wide-angle pictures . after you get camera , you'll probably want case some type it . there * lots * cases choose . after trying few looking lot more , i finally settled tamrac velocity 4 . it may or may not what you need case , but there it fyi	1
i purchased this my new canon 30d dslr . i mainly use it fills outside sunny days , but it used light up situation . i'm personally still learning how best angle light get best outcome , but i don't think it'll take long	1
this great unit . works great purpose which it made . i'm going eventually get 580 so i use it slave unit ( wireless option ) wraparound lighting system . i would recommend diffuser so light subdued especially when you wish brighten fleshtones people photo golden light so they presented their best image . blue spectrum light not present us best way	1
i bought this lens replace ef 100-300mm ( usm ) we my wife film shooting days ( not common lens , apparently ; 75-300mm seems more widespread ) . older lens produced some surprisingly good pictures ( quite sharp ) , but handheld shots hard get right long focal lengths . image stabilization feature this lens works remarkably well , but it quite bit noisier than ef-s 17-85mm ( my first lens ; you hardly hear gyrations all one ) . sharpness quite good ( probably tad better than ef 100-300mm , although it not foremost strength this lens my opinion ) . i surprised how much faster i acquire focus this lens , even though reviews suggested it still falls short l-series lenses ( see e.g. " flying gull " shot i uploaded " customer images " set ) . if you want shoot hand-held 150mm+ , i don't think this lens much competition under $1000 canon eos users	1
after debating this 70-200 series i decided purchase this lens . i pleasantly surprised results . i also own 17-85 50mm 1.8 lenses i found i gotten " most pleasing " results this lens . pictures very sharp my 20d - even 200mm - 300mm range . i've also happy quality bokeh . primary drawback i see af tends hunt fair amount when confronted low contrast images . said , i used it some flying bird shooting wildlife refuge surprised see how many shots sharp focus . however , it little bit all or nothing . several shots also wildly out focus . since lens fairly slow focus , you never know what you're gonna get such fast moving object against distant sky . i much more consistent results when shooting soccer , softball football park . af speed not present issue any these activities results excellent . i wish lens little less expensive but i prints i gotten my 13 19 printer worth extra money	1
wonderful camera . very flexiable , very versitile . most wonderful creation device someone whom capable . def good buy now 30d out . i've this camera over year i still love it	1
impressive feature list wih affordable price , serious ameteur . i've using 20d 18-55 , 50mm 1.8 , 35-80 , 80-200 500/1000mm lenses . i am not disappointed . i am planning upgrade series lenses but slowly . i not mean over entusiastic canon , but i am yet see nikon camera same specs same or ever near equal price . i've got fm10 film photography . i love both my cameras . impressive features include : mirror lockupiso 3200 noise reduction18 custom functionsaccepts entire series canon lens . heavy metal body ( no cheap plastic feel	1
i bought this camera 2 months before my son born . i knew little digital slrs , but after research i found this one me . this camera well constructed durable . pictures excellent . i blown few my pictures up 11x17 without any problem . also , if you going doing any editing photos your computer , this camera would great . i would recommend purchasing newest version photoshop or photoshop elements ( when i bought mine it only came elements 2.0 3.0 already market ) . also , if you want your pictures turn out , you must purchase larger flash . onboard flash weak , leave shadows it not allow you any type " bounce " flash . whole , this best camera i ever my life it would great anyone who previous experience slr cameras .	1
i took few identical photos without this filter , saw no difference sharpness nor contrast . so , if you're looking save damage your lense , this way go . i like able clean this filter quickly . otherwize i would spend 10-20 minutes cleaning lense so very carefull not scratch it . also , it minimize uv haze ... but i havn't compared with/without type situation . ( please comment if you different opinion ... ( brand )	1
i looking medium range zoom my d-70s reasonably fast sharp throughout zoom range . this lens first class winner all areas . it my first vr lens ( vibration resistance ) alone makes it worth cost . no more tripods ! it smooth operation feels very solid ( if not little heavy ) use . f/ 2.8 speed coupled 8 aperture leaves gives velvety smooth bokeh ( desirable soft blurred background ) makes your subject snap right out shot . len razor sharp 70mm 200mm . if there any distortion , i haven't seen it . lens this long , ghosting might show up if you shoot almost directly into sun . huge hb-29 lens hood helps lot . again , i not seen any ghosting yet . this definately pro/pro-sumer len its price tag alone re-enforces fact . if you afford it , remember golden rule ... it lens makes picture not camera . all pixels world can't make up poor lens . if you ready play big boys , then this belongs your bag	1
i love this lens . this excellent complement my nikon 28-70 2.8 . it well balanced d200 f100 ( mb grip ) . just last weekend used family wedding . it really not lens casual photography . if you not willing tolerate heavy equipment , sincerely , you take much better pictures ps digital cameras , i sometimes . after all taking pictures capturing moments if this lens get into your way , it no use . i personally only prefer fixed 2.8 apertures across zoom range . this very important me since i like use mostly aperture priority especially taking people pictures . why i love this lens . this very expensive lens . if vr not important you , go more reasonably priced almost identical optical qualities nikon 80-200 2.8 . me vr very important since i cannot afford use tripods when i am moving around taking pictures my kids or friends . if you could afford it , it great lens you never regret . if you cannot afford it just you thinking purchasin expensive camera body , don't waste your time camera specs , d70 vs d200 vs d2xs etc . buy cheaper camera , but still buy this lens long you willing carry heavy equipment around comitted take pictures such heavy equipment . bokeh amazing , rich contrast , creamy blurring behind subject 2.8 simply delicate delicious	1
it better save camera real lens which replaced this filter broken than expensive lens behind it . this real " lens saver "	1
this very good compact camera , but there few things make some pictures problem . when shooting low light conditions there seem lot problems flash , especially if i take pictures kids . flash makes person/object way too light , no matter what kind flash i use auto/on/red eye etc . if i try not use flash , then there lot blur . when outside bright sun most images way too light . i very grateful anyone who knows how resolve these problems . it little frustrating . i tried every possible setting , but so far no luck	1
this camera fits easily my pocket takes fantastic pictures ultra compact . it easy use i no problems it	1
i very small camera ( canon sd450 ) find this tripod perfect match . it light small easy carry included canvas case . it few nice features i didn't expect ( even though i read text ! ) like bubble level platform . this product excellent value . however , shipping cost much tripod . course , not tripod fault .	1
this stuff worth your small money , useful your precious cameras	1
i think this best buy anyone , superfast , flexible ( 50-3200 asa ) interchangeble lenses , long last battery , all excellent , only bad thing high price but it worth it , its like ferrari , almost you want keep it home case something bad happens like stolen or damaged even some people say big size inconvinencie i personally would not like tiny camera professional photographer it woud look ridicoulous , so size good thing also , when people even dont know camera impressed stuff it	1
i am pro photographer who formerly used medium format . i wanted get digital slr better than film quality . eos 1ds mk ii it ! it weather/dust resistant ( point ) when combined canon " " series lenses , if you own this body , those lenses must-have . controls easier master than i first thought . it fast , no shutter lag fast write card . colors details shadow/highlights amazing ! truly joy hold ! if you want best , this it	1

canon 250d 500d doublet type close-up lenses which corrected chromatic abberation ( " achromat " ) . they offer better performance than less expensive singlet type lens . i happy performance these lenses used ef 100mm/ 2.0 , even when used stacked together higher power ( which canon not recommend )	1
this pouch godsend so i bought 2 . i use them my efs 60-mm efs 85-mm lenses . base feels firm so lens sitting inside protected won't go anywhere made out strong naugahide . pouch itself thick felt rope pulls made heavy nylon twine feels silky your hand . whole pouch well built protect but handled roughly still protect contents , your precious lenses	1
i've quite satisfied my nikon d50 i've using built-in flash occasionally get evenly lit images balanced exposed shots . but built-in flash just doesn't cut it . i made huge mistake taking pics my cousin wedding reception huge hall thinking tripod , high iso settings , built-in flash suffice . i wrong . i borrowed fellow photographer spare speedlight ( sb-600 ) when i downloaded pics my computer some fine tuning , i noticed huge difference built-in flash . speedlight gave me more area covered flash . roughly under $200+ , this quite bargain . i'd recommend rechargeable aa batteries . recycle time flash fast .	1
i bought this flash use my nikon d200 it works better than i hoped . you fine tune it your own personal liking it more options than i am currently smart enough use . but don't worry , you don't super camera geek get great results right off bat . this thing great " reach " it actually zooms right your lens pinpoint your subject . it just audible enough let you know it doing . i'm definitely glad i bought this thing . much better than small pop-up flash	1
i just upgraded 20d , speed just blows 20d out way !! image quality runs same both cameras since they're both 8.2 mp , but how camera gets you those images simply amazing . fastest shutter out there , low noise , consistent color , spot metering , multiple spot metering , weather sealing , list goes !! this camera demands best glass , but you won't sorry . if your serious photography any field , this camera won't disappoint !! bit pricey , but believe me , it worth every penny !!!! see some my work ( ...	1
this great tool those shots where you want get down low . macro work landscape/waterscape shots near ground so much easier angle finder than without . i also used it when doing portrait work get more flattering angle without kneel or stoop over whole time . now negative . it fogs up much easier than normal eyepiece , which makes seeing anything challenge under some conditions . big one me , especially macro work , you loose some light when using angle finder . so if you already working low-light situation , this only makes matters worse . but well-lit conditions where fogging not issue you want shoot low , this amazing accessory , thus 4 out 5 stars	1
this excellent camera ! i purchased mine feb . ' 06 used it continually 2+ months before i decided write this review . first , i am avid amateur photographer , i wondered if this camera would worth expense , non-pro . i've found i not regret this purchase any way . i researched it several months even bought digital rebel xt first , thinking i'd rather not spend so much camera ( i like rebel xt it fun back up camera ) .... i confused which camera choose . most official reviewers either not review it , because there not " much " difference btw . it id mark ii or simply said if you wanted shoot sports or fast action , then 1d mark ii way go . i don't shoot those ... i'm wedding/portrait person . however , i also shoot landscapes fast moving animals well wanted weather proofing speed comes mark ii . so choosing 5 , ( time ) upcoming 30d 1d mark ii very difficult . one pro review site said mark ii needless upgrade mark ii . i found odd remark because canon changed almost everything they didn't like mark ii . you record both raw jpeg same time , different cards . 2.5 " lcd magnified any point , check sharpness , there definite absence noise shadowed areas you not pair this lense get excellent photos . aside my lenses , i use 50mm 1.4 , 70-300 85mm 1.8 excellent image quality across board . i am small woman found camera weight takes some time get used . however , camera itself so fast it compensated any camera shake i might , due weight , it speed . , now i am used it , i hardly notice it . multitude control buttons confusing , but if you used 1d mark ii , it not difficult switch . if you used rebel xt , keep manual handy your first few times out . whether you shoot jpeg or raw , photos manipulate well photoshop you don't lose any quality ( my opinion ) not 12 megapixels 5d ( which 1 only 2 reasons why i considered 5d ) . large enlargments ( 16x20 ) print up quite excellently again , you speed never miss shot . i've found shooting portraits difficult shoot subjects ( children , pets , someone who doesn't want sit portrait but his wife making him ... ) , speed matter often it saved me failed shoot ! 1.3 fov crop factor ( vs . full frame 5d ) definitely factor weighed . frankly , i use 17-40l get excellent landscape photos . wide ( 22mm ) i could ever wish , not get " fish-eye " . so , i don't find crop factor personal issue but it something i take into consideration my choice . while it limits my 24-70l my 24-105l only 31.2 mm wide angle , it gives my 70-300 " just enough " extra zoom boost ( 390mm ) i don't buy yet expensive lens . i've trying think negatives this camera , order give balanced review . i said , initially weight issue well learning controls . both quickly overcome . cost definitely factor , but especially anyone who this living , it definitely worth $ . i like everything this camera ( i've gone through several others get here ) . when i don't it me , find myself my a620 ( my " purse " emergency camera ) i get so frustrated a620 won't anything even close what i've now come expect standard all cameras . so i guess that one downside , because it large slr , i don't carry it absolutely ( though almost ! ) everywhere . however , overall , unless you want pay close $7k ds extra megapixels , i don't believe there better camera market . i realize while this review doesn't cover all technical specs ( you get either cnet.com or the-digital-picture.com ) i hope it helps someone like me who really difficult time making ultimate decision	1
someone make sense this me please ? """ smaller maximum aperture , smaller lighter lens . """ wtf ? anyway ... it affordable range those us real world explore . it gets 4 stars price vs usability joe soaps jane like me out there	1
i developed dimple my right retina places blur center my field view . i am right handed so my right eye my " sighting eye " . this device gives me clearance use my left eye focus compose my shots . i love it	1
i purchased this extender so i could more comfortable looking through viewfinder . 5/8ths inch doesn't seem like big difference , but it enough put some space your face camera . your face pressed against camera good thing , it helps stabilize camera reducing camera shake . however i find 20d very uncomfortable without extender . my discomfort comes more how eyepiece cushion rests eye not so much smashed nose . extender doesn't prevent camera pressing against my nose , although it clearly doesn't press much . my face still contact back camera . eyepiece cushion feels more comfortable pressed against eye extender place . install , you remove eyepiece cushion camera , slip extender then reattach eyepiece cushion extender . extender reduce magnification viewfinder , but not enough issue me . extenders purchased your eye glass prescription strength mind so one doesn't need wear their glasses when using camera . this particular extender not correct vision . this extender stays my camera all times . pros : gives your nose some breathing room . adds comfortcons : reduces magnification viewfinder	1
this great lens any user , professional or amateur . this lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive/clean results . slight distortion noticeable when shooting 10mm ( 16mm cropped ) but this easily correctable software . addition , very fast absolutely silent usm huge plus . i highly recommend this lens anyone wanting great landscapes or great door/architecture shots ( especially realtors )	1
i highly recommend this super wide angle lens anyone wanting take landscape pictures , buildings or lots other stuff ! it so different than standard kit lens ( 18-55 ) . you won't sorry when you start learning all possibilities extraordinary lens	1

i bought 250d lens use my sony dsc-f717 it just wonderful . i also use it my canon g3 because i bought canon ladc58b conversion lens adapter ( which required inexpensive ) . i hearing lot good things this lens digital photography forums i seen many wonderful examples its use . i recommend this lens anyone who wants make their " macro " photography shine . get one ! just clear there 52mm 58mm don't confused which one fit your camera . edit : just clarification : this one ' ' " 58mm " even though above ( this page ) when you click links " see more technical details " " see all product description " it mentions " 52mm " . this misleading confusing . very very top this page it says " 58mm " . let me just assure you this particular one ' ' " 58mm " ' not ' " 52mm " . late edit ( aug 04 , 06 ): well , it looks if amazon finally corrected misleading info i mentioned just above my clarification	1
i shoot canon 20d used canon ef 28-135mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 usm lens my wide angle option . when preparing extended stay budapest , i decided it time invest faster , better quality wa lens . i reviewed lens lineup canon website decided canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 . lens owner , i confident this lens would great addition my lens lineup . lens , this serious lens meant serious photographers . sturdy construction consists three aspherical elements canon ud glass which largely eliminate secondary spectrum . weather-resistant construction lens mount , zoom focus rings switch panel helps protect lens elements . this lens not compatible 1.4 ii 2x ii extenders . canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 lens weighs 1.3 lbs/600g , accepts 77mm filters or holds gel filters . sure get good quality uv haze filter protect front lens element . not only i see this good practice , canon recommends doing so their site well . focus type standard twist zoom , permits auto or manual focus depending how switch set . addition , lens usm drive mechanism optimum af performance . included this lens front rear lens caps , lens hood , soft storage case , us one year warranty . case pull string soft case ( lz1319 ) also purchased separately . lens hood ( ew-83e ) used reduce lens flare protect front element certain situations . i admit i disappointed this lens while budapest . i found wide angle scenes focused subject distance , images soft . this precisely type images i wanted use this lens . just because this fast lens , it doesn't mean i shoot everything f/ 2.8 either some may claim . i good understanding exposure know how use aperture setting my advantage . it didn't matter what aperture i used , distant subjects soft my eyes . i wondered if lens needed adjusting or calibrating after hearing all great things people say . i lent lens friend who loved quality sharpness while taking close up shots . i then began wonder if i doing something wrong . after testing lens , i've concluded this not lens distant wide angle shots like suggested canon website . when subject matter much closer , like other side room or several feet away , this awesomely sharp lens . canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 lens too different compare canon ef 28-135mm . clarity sharpness incredible close-up shots , auto-focus quiet quick . even though this lens didn't fit my original purpose , it found place my lens collection . i don't foresee this lens one my most used options though . canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 comes price , but it worth every penny when used its strengths . pros : incredible clarity sharpness close-up shotsquiet quick auto-focus cons : heavy bulky ( this should expected these types lenses)distant subjects come out soft	1

fisheye lens lot fun , i enjoy using mine . however , i find practicality lens minimal . i don't usually want my " serious " photographs fisheye distortion . i don't tend like 1.6 crop canon lower-end digital slr cameras , but fisheye this interesting benefit : it reasonably easy use fisheye standard wide-angle lens , since most distortion removed 1.6 crop . you still get distortion , but it lot easier compose shot without it using 1.6 camera than full-frame camera . either way , lots fun . buy one enjoyment , or even professional assignments if your work calls it , but think if you really want distortion before getting one these	1
excellent performance , reasonable price . highly recomend this product	1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1

quick , compact , light brilliant pictures but lacking veiw finder " anti-shake " syste	1
never ending race larger larger megapixel counts , d70s fallen behind pack . ( however , if that only measure which you're judging digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it quite good camera . what i like it most : - it looks feels solid . some reviewers pan this camera feeling flimsy plasticky apparently still stuck realm pro cameras cost several thousand dollars . it not bulletproof titanium box you back hummer over , but it certainly seems outdo dslrs it category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility decade worth nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - latch keeps pop-up flash place broke less than week . - inability meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack full functionality flashes other than sb-600 sb-800 . - nikon raw software control software aren't included camera , imho overpriced . ( ... top , nikon split what used one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages ... ) what would improve this camera most : - iso 100 iso 3200+ - ability store multiple custom white balance presets , then pull them up fly . - replacing " idiot modes " ( i.e. " portrait " , " landscape " , etc . ) modes you could customize	1
excellent camera kit . versatile . i lot learn camera , though , it no simple point-and-shoot . however , auto mode , it takes great point-and-shoot pictures . i look forward learning how use it fully . lenses came warranty cards , but camera itself not . i bought sb-600 flash well battery two 1 gb compact flash cards round out kit . camera lens attached large , which i underestimated . $80 camera bag too small it all . great camera , though . price best i could find anywhere	1
this filter fine normal shooting , but if you low-light work , beware ; you see bad internal reflections night shots , need remove filter	1
great product people want more out their digital camera . not so easy operate beginning , but learning quick results extremely satisfying . little dedication , you able manipulate secrets high end photography . best buy buck	1
i spent lot time reading reviews posts , finally i bought it , it best camera i used , i went old konica 35mm film camera sony cybershot 2 mp then not camera while later i kodak p850 ( great camera also , but slow my taste ) finally this s9000 , belive me this great choice it only camera i found positivly compared dlsr still prosumer camera , tells lo t.t he lack picture stabilization not big deal , it anti blur mode which almost same , full array controls manual settings help please amateurs not so ameteurs . it also first steps os face detection it multifocus mode , which focuses most times subjects faces where ever they frame ( not necesary centered ) , i mention it its limitations you know how compose your sho t.t he user guide easy read , understand follow , you don't know nothing photografy this manul you use most functions few hours easy . summary : 5 5 !!! nice camera	1
good price 9mp camera 10x zoom . image quality good . i'm still shooting mainly 3mp 5mp good results . spot metering works really well , especially while shooting bright day objects sitting under umbrella . macro works nicely . i still yet find good use super macro . camera recycles shots pretty quick . anti-blur mode ( using higher iso rate ) works well . controls/menu make sense . although i wish memory switch feature not buried too deep menu . that good feature . you 2 memory cards camera xd so cheap . you combined capacity instead buy bigger more expensive card . i especially like how menu displayed even inside viewfinder ( it exact copy lcd ) . way , i don't take my eyes off my object while cycling through menu . i wish battery life could better . effort conserve battery power , i shoot mainly using viewfinder avoid using flash using anti-blur mode . but bright side , one just carry more high-capacity , rechargeable aa . it just takes while get used battery consumption rate . i carry 2 sets backups where third one alkaline	1
i am pleased this camera . its pretty easy use . i virtually no camera experience , save breaking them . this camera easy operate pretty fun fool around . i used aperture setting several times get different focus points pics . instructions easy comprehend . i taken quite bit sports photos i noticed its extremely difficult get shots inside gymnasium . shots usually very blurry color just isn't right most time . fluorescent modes camera helpful , but not fix problem . it could just me though	1
it seems surprising canon would make product out anything but best materials . lensmate makes superior product out aluminum black silver	1
black this same my camera , all parts together , this one professional looking set up ! i am not sure if this hood cuts down glare/reflection , i not used it sunny day , but i don't see why it shouldn't . cheap this little product , it pretty much must this camera ! ( s3 ) one last side note , should you alreay own extra lens or two . they happen metal , very carful screwing them into this plastic adaptor ! i made mistake put whole thing fridge hour , so metal would shrink , i could get pieces apart	1
it great camera . it small size , good optical zoom excellent quality . i love it too much i take it anywhere carrying it it nikon small case	1
i am not photographer , but pictures i take look great . it feels great know i capture memories vivid color too . ( that setting i always use . ) other hand though , there long wait time use camera again after picture taken using camera flash . i don't quite know why but it seems if you take many pictures quick succession then using cameras flash not best way go ! all all , price i paid quality quite suitable . if you don't any experience photography , buy this one	1
i bought this camera my sister , early christmas present , thinking i would need some time set it up her , well less then 30 minutes i ready , it awesome camera , i impressed , ease set up formatting 512 sd card . i sent site sister whom interested . it easiest camera use features impress anyone , great photos very close far away . i would recommend this camera anyone	1
item exactly expected . packaging shipment , other item i ordered , unacceptable . child could better	1
i'm using this hood canon ef-s 10-22mm lens 20d . it bit shocking how big this hood until you realize it really necessary very wide field view . canon 20d , lens equivalent ef 16-35mm 2.8 , only it 3.5 - 4.5 . bottom line it trick made same good quality rest canon stuff	1
money , you absolutely can't beat this lens . it very fast sharp . not fast focus , but what you expect $70 ? i four lenses , some costing 4x much this one ... yet i use this one most . anyone looking step up kit lens , or anyone looking buy camera body w/out kits lens should look buy this lens	1
awesome lens , especially price . it very fast 50mm even 1.6 mag my rebel xt easily manageable	1
other day i used friend standard digital camera little while . whole time i found myself missing manual zoom , instant response convient manual buttons my d50 . this camera takes amazing pictures . dslr beginner i used camera auto mode first several weeks , now after reading some books photography i'm slowing starting use manual features . d50 lets me choose level control i'm comfortable , full manual full automatic ; both options just turn dial away . body this camera built like tank . metal high quality plastics abound . buttons provide good feedback switches feel solid durable . it beautiful piece precision engineering	1
not much add other positive reviews posted , other than i am user loves my d50 . it year now shot over 10,000 photos excellent results ( mostly landscape wildlife ) . excellent image quality hand grip fits perfectly both my hand my husbands . only con i think this time there no backlight top panel - this makes it difficult adjust settings low/ no light situations . also , people used little compact point shoot cameras this might seem little overwhelming first bulky carry around ( which why i little pocket camera my purse ) . i also got 18-200 lens love it - perfect walk around lens	1
i used 1.4 ii extender over year . it gives me amazing detail my 70-200l f/4 lens 20d . i use it mostly wildlife butterflies . contrast good colors pop . when shooting sunny day shutter speeds still quick f/ 5.6 background blurred beautifully . shade areas low light tripod must ! there hasn't any sacrifice subject detail . i see individual hairs butterfly bodies even when shooting wide open . this great way get closer without paying significant amount supertelephoto lens	1
my mom i each one these cameras . neither , one us any problems until recently . i dropped mine while taking pictures timer . drop my tile floor smashed telescoping lens out alignment wouldn't close gave e8 error screen . i contacted canon us website then , i sent it into canon repair center il . it cost $87 it repaired shipped back . it took week half it returned me . only thing i would improve this camera speed , i trouble taking pictures my son merry go round(but it could i need change settings ) . it many features it accessories add . since , i am learning more digital photography this great little starter camera many features canon known . also recently i've looking some newer canon models , their casing/ bodies look/feel really cheap me . it may make them lighter but it makes me really afraid i would break them	1
typically fine original design canon . i " chinese " copy - it really - it works but it not same mfr own .	1
this camera pretty good , it very fast , photo quality excellent , video recording mode awesome , perfect carry everywhere since it pretty small , but after several months normal use , metal case begins look pretty rusted , that why i dont give this camera 5 star rating . but check flickr photos , you see examples great photo quality camera	1
i needed lens hood my 50mm lens paying $25 hood $75 lens might seem ridiculous . however , might because $75 lens so inexpensive . if lens $250 then paying extra 10% might not seem too bad . i just saw total cost lens hood $100 that good terrific prime lens its hood . however , please note : lens hood rather shallow ( 1 star reduction ) it screw-on two piece kit ( 1 star reduction ) . one piece adaptor screws-on where filters normally go ( uv filter ) front lens intended permanent integral part lens second piece hood snaps off this adaptor . adaptor ring retains same 52mm rim size so your protective filter go before or after adaptor . ( 1 bonus star ) because $100 still bargain 50mm , 1.8 , super fast , super sharp , super clear , light weight beginner lens hood kit ! i hope this helps rather than confuse . :)	1
first off this very nice lens money . i mine now three months love it . it great walk around lens 28-135 just right most pictures kids landscape pictures . it fast focus sharp clear pictures clear up 125 range gets little soft 135 but easily fixed little post editing . i taken most my pictures hand held works great . i even recommended it friend . i am using it 30d it spends most its time there . i am not sorry i purchased this lens taking lot more pictures it future .	1
this great lens used almost everything . it great if you only want take one lens you . pictures very sharp color good	1
this cheap lens - old design , very plastic - prove terribly useful those budget who want wider perspective , especially 1.6 crop factor dslrs . i learned " cheap " this lens - broke focus ring day after delivery . but i blame myself too , replacement given me no trouble , though i think my first one bit sharper than second . many standards , this lens match or exceed zoom lens comparable price ( prime lens should ) . autofocus little buzzy , but main time you'll notice when it loses its bearing suddenly lurches way off target . mostly , focuses quickly enough well . some chromatic aberration worst-case scenarios , but nothing awful or unexpected . vignetting , even 1.6 crop , noticeable , mainly sky shots , but gradual rather than sudden . ( might unacceptably worse full-frame camera . ) undue distortion seems minimal - haven't really checked but also haven't really noticed , if you see what i mean . flare seems average , perhaps better than one would expect such wide glass . bokeh nonchalant , not dreamy but never intrusive . but price , positives make up negative " average " tendencies . it vibrantly colorful contrasty almost fault . hard light little more challenging this lens , little more tricky balance exposure highlights shadows . it softish wide-open , but very unobjectionably - yet regret shooting f/ 2.8 . my main lens 50mm f/ 1.4 , switching back forth same aperture setting perfectly functional practice . lose little crisp taking four times much space , that trade-off i run . ( their filter threads match too . ) f/4 higher , i get " plenty sharp , " though i've never seen " unreal sharp " this glass ( i 50mm ) . " crop factor " over-simplifies effect mounting wide-angle lens 1.6 camera . yes , field view match 40mm full-frame , but perspective not , because you'll closer your subjects . shooting live subjects ( like bands , models , or street life ) require learning curve , so beware mission critical work before you've broken yourself so you anticipate its exagerations . said , i bought this lens primarily " head-to-toe " model shooting my modest studio , it real asset . interestingly , it tends toward very useful " slimming effect " makes hippy girls look more slender shorter girls more ambiguous height ( least " head-to-toe " distance them ) . disconcerting first but terribly useful once you've gotten hang it . ( beware chicken legs or reverse dramatic perspectives . ) i read every review i could find before purchase , this lens seemed magic middle higher cost clarity 20mm cheaper lesser sharpness 28mm . near i tell , i nailed it . this not spectacular lens , but very very functional one if you need affordable wider angle generally won't let you down	1
if you've bought sd550 , this great addition , case saved my camera couple times already scratches dings ( especially little kids around ) , extra camera chord long durable ( coated metal link chain ) extra battery course invaluable . i'd give it 5 stars , if i didn't feel these items should come standard camera . :	1
i working major daily newspaper baltimore 2 decades . perhaps qualify me expert photography . i shooting digital imagery since late 1990s . maybe qualifies me expert digital photography . this may long- winded , but it extensive useful . i received nikon d2h camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago . i think i got them shortly after d2h system released 2003 . since then , i used them shoot images all types -- documentary , sports , daytime , available light , flash , dead- of- night -- paper i work . this only camera i work . first , please read manual . there ton information there , information terrific begin . d2h highly- configurable , screen after screen you set your own specific use ( resist lending camera anyone long period time , your camera may returned many your settings changed so much it acts like thoroughly different camera ) . i'll just punch right way it feels . camera rather heavy beast , some , there amount shoulder or neck fatigue when using it hours per day , like i . but camera feels well hand controls easy move through . i've long since given up using any camera bag . all i fanny pack 14mm , 55mm , teleconverters 2 extra camera batteries flashes clipped its belt . d2h hold 17-35mm nikon 80-200mm nikon one- touch or sigma 120-300mm 2- touch . shooting breeze . batteries let you shoot long before need recharge . i my d2h set iso 200 or 400 most time sacrifice shutter speed lower iso often i , because higher isos bring digital noise loss color saturation . just today , i purchased digital noise plug ins photoshop limit this , that wonderful thing invest this camera when you must shoot action photography no flash iso 800 above . i now little problems capturing images even barely- limited lighting . i recently shot stars plane wing my seat airbus 36,000 feet over pacific 30 seconds wide open @ f/ 2.8 , it looks tons better than night shots via d1h , which lacked internal digital noise filter . filter kicks around 1/2 second longer exposures , make you wait long your image you've shot strip your long exposure much digital noise . when you shoot this way ( general ) , don't simply react cranking up iso because you not happy your results . camera loud . over 7 frames per second , it make you obvious quiet room . shooting sensitive situations testy , so limit your shooting single frames . i wish this camera option silence this camera , but since mirror raise lower , there no chance this . am i happy d2h ? definitely , yes . there improvements made ? yes . but benefits outweigh drawbacks . people bailing out using nikon system going canon , which some incredible gear , i won't deny . but instead simply giving up your system equipment , learn how use d2h well you'll much happier than ever . means you should push its qualities max while respecting its limitations . instance , white balance . this best thing you , or worst thing you've ever dealt , depending upon how you approach it . daylight , grey skies , dusk dawn easy , because you set camera daylight , flash , shadow ( dusk dawn times ) even fluorescent incandescent tend right ballpark . but horrible mixed light or street lamps glow blue/green or orange- red mercury vapor death image if you don't properly use white balance . preset white balance king , here . i get grey , black white when i preset mercury vapor light . i used preset any light auto white balance setting can't figure . there also setting dial kelvin temps well ! if you this ( i go miles here ) , you're your way . so , trying this d2h , or considering it , read through some digital d2h forums ignore posts slam camera without giving instances . generally , those who pan camera not tried understand it . i bang off images disprove where they suggest this camera fail . when you decent light , you'll decent image . but when you try use it without learning how you maximize system , you come shooting images terrible unprintable . closing , i not paid anyone , i no nikon stock no outside interest writing this except i'm giving d2h credit where it long overdue	1
now i this my camera while now , my camera feels so weird it off , i love grip it gives extra battery life great those all day shooting events i go . i wish buttons same plastic/chrome color ones camera but its well built product works fine so i cant complain	1
neccesary add cannon rebel . good product . too bad it doesn't come camera	1
if you're serious photography , get this accessory . second battery , i get plenty juice any event ( even my zoom lens using image stabilization ) . gives solid grip taking vertical ( portrait ) pictures while still access controls you need . i can't imagine without it now ( spite additional weight ) .	1
i am so pleased this camera ! there really nothing negative i think say it ! i also own cannon xt . i use both wedding photography well family portraits i am so impressed color quality d30 ! well cannon	1
those who truly know digital cameras , more than perhaps 8 megapixels important only if you plan blowing your images up " poster size " , or if you pro who knows how use all those pixels . truthfully , how many you really plan type stuff ? say rebel xti better than 30d because it " more megapixels " " smaller " not best advice . any canon dslr going give you great images , if know how use it . those you who trying decide which camera buy , you really need go camera store ask handle each camera . while you're it , ask yourself how it feels your hands . it too bulky ? it too small hard handle ? it features you want such spot metering , which rebel xti not ? 30d terrific dslr . it all features 99% us need . there reason why it costs more than rebel . 30d better camera overall .	1
this lens wonderful starter lens . professional might want little upgrade , but this just right someone starting out .	1
my 6 year old boys each got camera christmas . they so excited sooo much fun taking pictures . we went download pictures they weren't camera . i figured boys deleted pictures mistake , so i took pictures immediately tried download them still got message there no pictures camera . i didn't expect great quality pictures , but i expect my kids would've gotten see pitcures they took ! what piece junk ! my boys so dissappointed . cameras both trash .... what waste money . not buy this camera if you actually want pictures .	-1
this original battery my camera . if fits perfectly unlike clone battery i purchased elsewhere . i think digital camera , always buy original battery . go real deal .	1
digital picture frames must one hottest christmas gifts 2006 i couldn't find one anywhere give iou . just purchased received philips frame , it well worth wait	1

i purchased dc dxg-301v digital video recorder my son who graduating this year high school he thought it would fun record his last few months his friends . it easy use very compact if you're like me , if your child happy then you're happy	1
i no complaints . i this camera over year half it reliable , fast , gives me crisp , quality photos ! only option i wish this camera better stabilization mode prevent blurred pictures , but software edits blur without reducing quality . blurry pictures not problem long you know how aim shoot . everyone loves playing my camera because it many cool features make your photos fun ! i highly recommend this camera ( especially beginners or those who just want simple camera capture those precious moments , high quality photos ) . excellent camera overall ! ;	1
first off , this camera simple use , very convenient size ( size fat ipod ) . video quality pretty decent , i use it upload youtube myspace videos . i would recommend it just , if you're looking uploading videos internet . videos saved really easily ( usb port directly unit so handy ) edited/spliced microsoft movie maker . ( using this program also cuts mb size considerably ! )my only complaint so-called 30 minute recording capability . i 3 minute video my card it said i only 21 minutes left recording . after i filled card i noticed i not full 30 minutes , maybe 18-20 . oh , audio bit funky side , mainly because it tends give lisp any ' ch ' ' ' sounds . look this camera up youtube see examples	1
we love this camcorder ! we bought it because our other bulky , digital video uses tapes , which we would copy onto vhs/dvd , stopped working . we didn't want spend lot money . we loved idea it easier carry my purse you could download it straight computer or burn it ( which very simple , you not download any software . ) i admit i little reluctant quality picture would less than great , only 60 minutes concerned me , but pictures great i haven't ran out time yet . we used this indoors , outdoors no problems . we recorded our son basketball games it worked great . we read where batteries didn't last very long , but we using rechargeable batteries impressed lifetime they . this must those who children or grandchildren	1
this bag light small but it very convenient if you just carry video camera memory stick . i definitely enjoy it	1
this case really handy appropriate camcorders , used it new york this summer not bulky , however it won't hold any accessorie	1
this carrying case ideal carrying your dcrhc/42 all your family events . it fits great around your shoulder , uses little space , enhances maneuverability all your basic equipment when body movement . fact , i two cases : bigger one storing all accessories this one take wherever i go . it very comfortable , more importantly , keeps your handycam very secure . light gray color nice . my wife loves it . me , too	1
i actually purchased 2 these christmas presents . i gave one pair my son " early christmas " gathering my husband so enthused quality , i ordered pair him .... received them before christmas ! per my husband : " very good quality ... compact so they take up very little room glove box my car !	1
used this trip hawaii - brought lava much closer ( looked great night ) . it not difficult focus , provides clear images . i not disappointed least . compact size makes it pocketable - perfect any traveler/casual user . recommende	1
i got this battery my kodak digital camera . i use camera least 5 times week , recharge battery least once day -i doing this over 2 years . battery definitely losing it charge now -it only stays charged 100 photos ( which good anyway ) ... but battery instructions say it last 1000 charges i far , far more than out it , it excellent value money	1
this my 2nd digtial slr . film days , i using nikon products . my initial foray into digital photography , i switched canon ( 10d ) just see what other side fence . after three years , i switched back nikon because nikon products suits me better . no , this not " canon sucks , nikon rules " review . one thing i learned digital photography you should really decide not camera body itself , but whole lineup ... including lenses accessories . me , nikon lens line-up works me better , not because canon worse line-up ... i'm sure lot photographers find canon line-up much more sensible . now , camera itself : i've own this camera over year sold number stock images using this camera . suffice say , i'm very satisfied its performance ; i'm not going re-iterate praises that said previous reviews . what i am compelled say not-so-great characteristics this camera : iso400 above , it not very forgiving underexposure . if you not nail exposure , even raw you see noise shadow area when you try correct exposure raw software converter . this why you hear lot whining d200 owners regarding " noise . " most them don't nail exposure first time try adjust raw converter ... then bam ! noise shadows . auto white balance becomes iffy well underexposure ; everything becomes biased magenta underexposure ; this very hard correct even post-processing . nikon creative lighting system i believe feature makes nikon little better than canon artificial lighting exposure . basically , nikon designed their flash system multiple flashes mind . nikon auto-focus engine better than most canon folks tend evangelize . afs lenses i'm positive it fast any canons . if there one thing i would like change future iterations this product : i need more than one cross-type af points ! newer pentax dslr nine out its 11 af points ! this beneficial more accurate focus . so my recommendation ... if you already nikon lenses , thinking if it worth price difference jump d40/d50/d70 . it unequivocably " yes . " if you're just starting dslr system , i say look closely what nikon/canon/pentax/olympus/leica/sigma offer whole system then decide . if you decide nikon , you won't yearning own higher d2-series model this camera ; it almost same feature set lower price	1
ergonomics : perfect . d200 not completely rubber-encased . there rubber where your hands need hold it , plastic where your hands rarely touch it . hand grip comfortable nicely concave where tips your fingers dig . battery door memory card door made plastic , hinge-pinned . simple slide latch opens battery door .... some warned latch could easily ( accidentally ) tripped . memory card door latch , however , uses more secure 45 degree pivoting latch . usb 2 video out/dc-in doors made flexible rubber , these doors extend into body camera hinges themselves . english language operating manual work art . each operating concept alpha ' numerically numbered pictoral diagram , page where function explained perfect english . reader quickly catch how this well thought out manual organized . i like depth field preview , mirror lock-up , multiple-exposure capability . continuous servo autofocus better job than any human following focusing any moving object . if you old manual-focus , film-based nikon slr lenses ' 70 ' 80 , except few rare exceptions , fit d200 . all these positive attributes remind me best , most highly-evolved film camera slr . no wonder so many photographers won over digital media .	1
my first professional digital slr nikon d1x . i got great pictures it but it too large heavy lug around extended periods . i also some issues its operation . but now , nikon seems solved my issues d200 . i purchased dedicated sb-800 flash 18-200 lens recommended d200 manual . whole system much improved over my other digital slr . both focus metering seem work more reliably . it works better available light . optical anti-vibration aids overall picture sharpness ( plus those us who not rock-steady ) . i am getting use button sequence required enlarge picture preview really like amount magnification possible . menuing system seems quite extensive well-organized . i would like more latitude picture quality settings ( e.g. contract , saturation , sharpness ) . help screens really tell me something when i'm confused . i appreciate " modeling " feature . it useful when attempting compose dark situation . it also lets me see reflections before they committed picture . unfortunately this feature not work using built-in flash . i wish nikon could add some type lock continuous-single-manual focus selector front camera . my finger seems move switch unknowingly . i would appreciate battery charger built plug rather than detachable cord . person who still wears thick glasses , i wish nikon could make viewfinder more like one their old n8008 . or maybe it time away pentaprisoms mechanical mirrors give us truly pro camera mimics high-end pro-sumer models electronic viewfinders adjustable view screens	1
i am very pleased this camera . i especially like light meter tells you how many apertures you away correct exposure . i am using this my photo class easy use	1
snorkeling trip we used this camera both out water , results terrific . it produced some hysterical pictures my husband i underwater ! fish turned out well , coral . we looked like dorks ! it fun easy use	1
i purchassed this camera my first ever snorkling trip when i went bahama cruise . overall , i very pleased . pictures came out clear camera easy use even under water . only issue i it almost end roll film turn wheel jammed ceased work . i lost last two pictures . i'm not sure if it defect camera , or if i over zealous turning wheel my excitment event . considering quality developed pictures , i would certainly try this camera again .	1
like others i compared it scuba diving trip kodak max sport this one few advantages : 1 . film winded greater depth . 2 . pictures came out clearer - not grainy better colors . don't expect too much it depths below 8 meters since light won't enough ( i used it bright summer day red sea ) . even shallower depths colors turn blue/green without use flash . i taken it down depth 35 meters camera fine , but wouldn't take pictures depths below 20 meters . pictures i took shallow depth came out excellent	1

) . instruction book impressive camera itself . not design but its volume it all english . i still haven't managed digest but few sections . video quality excellent our purpose . there six different video resolutions variety photo resolutions available easy use menu system . shq tv resolution really stunning when you consider miniscule sized gizmo created it . we took camera key west last week recorded shq web ( 320x240 / 30fps ) resolution ( perfect making videos sharing web ) . every time you start stop recording , new mpeg4 file created sd memory card . using photo function creates high resolution jpeg file . end trip we couple hundred files download onto mac . we currently editing files into movie imovie . smaller video resolution i able get three hours mpeg4 files forty-two high resolution jpeg ( 2816x2112 ) files less than half 2gb sd card . same memory card holds hour half video highest resolution setting ( 640x480 / 30fps minimum compression ) . image stabilization works well enough moderate hand movement but it didn't keep up rough water sailboat around key west . i wish zoom range more field view wide end but it tighter than i expected telephoto end . this not camera long distance tight shots wild animals or beach bunnies . it no tripod mount so telephoto power just long enough image stabilizer cope when hand holding camera steady ground . my hands really too large controls but i found ways adapt . it fits my wife perfectly . ca6 supplied hand strap keep camera tethered your body supply leverage one handed use . i use strap mostly accident prevention use my left hand stabilize camera holding outside frame view screen while delicately mashing controls my fat thumb my right hand . even hand tether attached camera we easily carried camera tether our pockets without any problems i able some incognito filming duval street . relatively large ( very bright ) view screen folded back against camera while recording ( folding view screen back camera while not recording or reviewing shuts camera off ) " shoot hip " filming . small carrying pouch 2 or 4gb high speed sd memory card , i recommend additional battery necessary accessory . tiny battery powers camera video mode hour or so but using built flash photos knocks small cell down hurray . reviewing messing menu also cuts into battery duration . lithium ion battery physically smaller than my cell phone battery recharges less than two hours . use it completely enclosed inside camera . sanyo oem battery easy find web there number less expensive , alternative brands made fit xacti cameras . also , gentle use absorbent lens cloth keep view screen lens window clean . ca6 lacks convenience features would make it larger susceptible problems dirt water . there no ports , jacks or connections outside camera . battery , memory card usb port access located under well designed , seal tight door bottom camera . minimal control panel increases durability but somewhat limits easy access many system features . all adjustments made navigating through menu view screen via use your right thumb tiniest joystick i ever seen . it turned out much easier use than i though it would there provision program favorite settings into some " short-cut " moves control stick . above menu control button starting stopping video recording making photos . half-inch space small ridge separates two controls . exposure / record buttons menu control tiny buttons activate menu system select mode ( puts camera record or playback ) . considerations design purpose aside , i some issues sanyo should consider . camera needs accessory cradle some sort would allow it placed mounting thread . there number features offered camera next too useless unless i innovate some method remotely stabilizing it . gaffers tape works fastening it mounting clamp , monopod or walking staff but i hate putting anything sticky beautiful little frame . while sanyo designs mounting system they should also make remote control . focusing exposure controlled sophisticated , multi-pattern , through-the-lens computer program works well polarizing filter ( i used my sun glasses ) enhanced image quality . so why there no provision thread small diameter filter over round lens window opening ? sound recording quality very good selectable noise filters work better than i expected but i don't see point using up data space stereo sound when separation left right channel microphones few millimeters . i haven't digested all 166 pages instruction book but so far i can't find any provision recording mono sound mode . finally , motor noise zoom lens noticeable low noise situations . even though i seldom use zoom function while recording i realize this common issue small video cameras but it still bugs me . we usually strip away most recorded sound replace it music or dubbing when editing videos anyway . brandishing ca6 crowd attract attention . soon people realize it video camera they it like flies poop . my wife likes attention but i prefer unhampered other people curiosity . sanyo supplies suite video/photo editing dvd burning software pc users . ca6 lacks firewire connectivity live editing macs there no mac compatible software supplied but camera syncs well card reader my mac through usb port downloading files hard drive . any mac owner savvy enough edit video files burn dvd already software accomplish task . camera also possesses surprisingly extensive onboard-editing capability through viewing screen or your television . sanyo supplies cord plugs into usb connection provides composite video stereo sound output your television system where you view edit your video photo files utilizing camera amazing menu array . i no idea battery duration this purpose there no external power input camera ( battery external charging cradle ) . aware lower resolution video file settings look fine computer but they nasty your television . overall camera beautiful , reliable fun use lots features . it tiny , easy hide , fast starting , durable , water dirt resistant . images very good . i am delighted exacti ca6 so far ( when i get it away my wife )	1
there reason why some things cheap , it because they ... ummm ... cheap . bad frame , uneven color glass . polarizing filter aside air bubbles front glass , almost falls apart . screwing unscrewing them pain . if you even little bit serious photography , don't waste your money this set . get yourself least set hoya filters	-1
i bought this camera 6 months ago replace older sony camera no optical zoom . i chose sony because they accept aa batteries ( incredibly convenient those who like take pictures away home ) , because flash powerful enough make pictures taken complete darkness look like they taken during daytime , because my first sony camera very good quality . i immediately fell love s600 , until few weeks ago . least every other time i turned camera , lens wouldn't extend camera would tell me turn power off again . i would then it would work . but past few days , i turn it off several times before lens extend properly , camera makes ugly buzzing sound when zooming out . it seems like motor powers lens wearing out . i only taken 400 pictures this camera ... motor should not wearing out already ! it great camera - if you buy it , make sure keep your receipt so you send it back sony repairs . i didn't keep my receipt now am going buy new camera , but not sony	1
what steal this camera ! just got it mail this week , it proven itself well worth buying . i love pretty much everything it . pictures , even auto mode , crisp detailed . if you like photography side , aperture , shutter , focus settings very comprehensive . i never " real " camera before other than cheap 35mm one , haven't taken any photography classes or learned anything photography . i only read little bit online basics , within 2 days i adjusting settings scene needs wow pictures turned out great . if you interested photography , this definitely camera you . one thing mention , however , sd cards really fast while camera , but once you connect camera pc via usb , pictures take while load order edit ( photoshop ) . i highly recommend fast sd card , like sandisk sd extreme iii . battery life pretty good , even when doing video . videos look sound great , you take pictures while you record video . i looking this camera 2 months finally bought it , it well worth it . if you're fence this or more expensive canon or nikon , i'd go this unless you're super hardcore . 5/5 stars excellent product incredible price .	1
this camera takes great pictures travel outdoors . if you intend take family photo indoors you need large room group shots it 35-420 zoom . said i am very happy this camera it long list functions . software better than some i've seen . camera easy use right out box . make sure you buy memory card . battery ahs very long life but i bought spare so i wouldn't caught without my camera . my only complaint photo load slowly my computer compared other cameras	1
it good camera its price . pictures display little bit dark camera but when its loaded pc it comes out ok	1
i happy receive my camera , fast exactly what i ordered ,,... great shipper ...	1
very good first camera . easy use gives great pictures . highly recommen	1
i purchased this camera my young daugther , after canon i bought her fell apart after 3 weeks post-xmas no good reason . anyway , kodak works nicely enough , big screen view pix back , but tiny viewfinder , if you like use feature , its difficult . pix clear colors true . it takes videos which fun handy-for short shoot , course . price great . all around good camera buck . however , it eat baterries like crazy	1
this good quality lens . i bought it because sony recommended it hdr-hc3 i bought . i thought this would wider shot but i still rate it 5 star because it best quality your going get these types cameras unless you move up bigger cameras bigger " mm " filter size . i recomend sony vcl-sw04 37mm 0.45 wide angle lens even wider shots if you still find one . it made 37mm camera but if you still find one new it come adaptor rings fit your 30mm . it looks like sony doesn't make them anymore so you may just go this one . stick sony lenses these smaller video cameras if you don't want hd quality distorted	1
this must doing any close-up or indoor footage . if using hd 1080 video camera then you notice little blurriness edge frame . if you lot camera motion your video it not too noticeable , it mainly when camera static your eye tend zone it . over all it good product	1
i so happy scared same time . i never used digital camera before my life . guess what ? it so easy !! i give kodak all koodles	1
my only complaint : built-in flashes these cameras limited range . if you're shooting dark room subject 30 feet away , it time upgrade digital slr . otherwise - this great camera	1
this underwater case works just like non-pro hopes it . you get it out box , you put your camera , close lock . you jump water take perfect digital pictures . that it ! you access all functions while you're underwater . it really cool looking . i can't say enough great things this product	1
large camcorder like my sony fx7 this adds nice rear " ballast " balance eight hours taping time ! i use it long shoots small one comes cam short home stuff	1
gift recipient said it great . i can't add any more than	1
i purchased this camera gift after extensive research . recipient ended up buying themselves same camera before i could give it them . lucky me . this great little camera . it great beginner those want camera portable	1
i would recommend this camera sub $200 price range . easy use , multiple settings user friendly controls . i am very happy this camera	1
hd1 wonderful , amazing camera . it small enough you always it you -- i've carried mine months my front pants pocket its protective case , able capture family work stills video would otherwise lost . even if quality not up par , i would something instead nothing . but quality great ! i'll expand quality below . this camera genuinely high definition , more than three times resolution ntsc . this best shown comparing dv image captured firewire ( no ntsc modulation artifacts ) computer monitor , hd1 image transferred its sd card . notice this comparison should favor dv -- but instead , it makes increased resolution hd1 clear . hd televisons monitors already commonplace , video captured less than hd quality not highly valued ( like 8mm , good historical content ) . capturing now hd preserves value your video . this camera fits your pocket ! my bet anyone who thinks video this camera not significantly better than dv looking its output downconverted letterboxed ntsc , probably old tv . hd1 records 720p30 format hour 4gb sd card ( $70 ) . there no transport noise picked up on-board microphones , there no tape transport ! even lens finger noises attenuated intelligent placement microphones back fold-out screen , where unlike other cameras , they pointed subject ! it also external microphone jack , missing other cameras . once camera turned , folding viewfinder puts it standby mode no apparent impact battery life . this way , camera ready go couple seconds after viewfinder opened . mine stays standby , sometimes days uses . battery life very good ( but keep charged spare you , just like you keep second sd memory card ) . still shots this camera good or better than most dedicated still cameras . i would rate it just below sony dsc-t7 . however , hd1 10x optical zoom , which reduces need cropping , thereby preserving resolution . look stills video hd1 steves-[ ... ] ( different steve ) , which blowaway excellent web site comparing cameras . output hd1 not clean output sony hc3 or canon hv10 hdv comcorders , both which capture higher resolution . ironically both use cmos sensors which historically much noisier than ccds like hd1 . i suspect this due better post capture processing , so i'm eager try something like noise ninja or neatimage hd1 output . however , , it easy mix video all three using vegas video ( i'm sure other editors ) , especially when hdv cameras used tripod shots hd1 handheld , more casual shots . course , hv10 hc3 each cost twice hd1 , wonderfully compact they , neither fits your pocke t.t he program jet audio [ ... ] best i've found playing mpeg-4 video directly hd1 sd card pc . even free version great job . two other general purpose digital imaging notes : always make two copies your image files different media before erasing original ! rent some internet space web host somewhere across country ( or world ) copy your image files non-public area your web server space . this costs little $6 / month 150 gb or so somewhere secured , backed up facility . you still use public part space create web site . if there tornado , hurricane , earthquake , fire , etc . your " irreplacable family photos " ( including any old ones you've scanned or reshot your digital camera uploaded ) still safe . i understand this point there folks offering this sort service directly , although typically higher cost . review mentions " drawback " video freezing briefly when still captured while shooting video . other hand , this camera video mode shooting 30 1mp stills each second ! take your pick always get right moment . i mention hd1 genuine high definition video camera / recorder fits your pocket so you always it you ? what outrageous step forward ! i hope you like yours find it useful i mine . aloha , steve	1
it its job good it smart purchase protect your camera lens . it better take chance messing up $6 filter lens than your $500+ camera lens . only thing i didn't like this filter it comes very cheap case won't really protect it storage all . besides its all good	1
this charger excellent charging batterys hour . its great those last minute , i need battery moments . i actually 2 them . we 3 digital cameras i saved alot money :	1
while i don't own this charger ( still considering ) , i felt compelled state what i read elsewhere : individual thought his lenmar charger d.o.a. also . upon closer inspection , he noted thin plastic coverings over " touches " . upon removing them , charger worked ! so , heads up prospective buyers .	1
product works amazingly underwater , what cool thing , especially summer , or use vacations beach	1
good product . feets my needs ( amateur photographer ) . maybe not greatest filter , but good value cheap price you pay	1
this filter excellent brand high quality . exactly what it suppose it last long time . i used this brand filter many years many sizes all my cameras . if you don't one these your camera , you should	1
my sister owns this camera i've used it few times . it takes great pictures , quality pictures clear colors deep beautiful . i love this camera . she never any problems it .	1
i owned this camera over year . there most likely models out more pixels . i like this camera . it easy use optical zoom ensures i keep my resolution . if you take memory card your local drugstore ( or other picture printing store ) you should pleased quality pictures . my untrained eye i not tell difference digital 35mm	1
i love this camera . i bought it my trip paris . i found it very easy use . one feature i didn't realize it video sound . i found very useful . i bought 2gb memory card go camera . one it comes doesn't hold many pictures . software easy install use . not really small enough pocket but still great camera budget	1
this camera exelent camara . it plenty effects , plenty modes , plenty scenery options . image quality 3.2 megapixel , but its quite good . pictures you take without flash end up getting bit blury , where if you take it flash , it comes out exelent . sometimes it takes long time picture get taken out flash , sometimes it happens imediatly . but all these flaws only my version . but if you looking good camera great price , this your best option	1
camcorder fairly easy learn use . recorded video came out very clear crisp . i highly recommend it	1
if you plenty light you amazed shots this camera take . macro shots breathtaking . i haven't best luck low light noticed some vertical banding others noted . i'm not concerned battery life because i always consider second larger battery manditory purchase any camera . i also wouldn't wanted pay inclusion firewire cable which i already own . i highly recomend this take anywhere camera unmatched consumer video quality shooting environments plenty light	1
i forced upgrade our family vhs-c camcorder ( least this story i offered my wife ) because my son science fair project , which involved capturing incoming video ccd video camera coupled microscope , recording capture dv tape . our old vhs-c camcorder didn't any video-in capability , obviously wasn't dv . this unit canon also offered opportunity film high-def . wasn't critical our project , but i figured this where all camcorders going end up , we fill our homes new hd tvs , our landfills old lo-def crt-based tvs . i'm all future-proofing purchase . first problem : no firewire dv cable included camera . if canon include mini-usb cable , what big deal throw firewire cable ? c'mon , canon --- i expect more thousand-dollar camera . second problem : no video capture software included box . time my purchase , there mail-in promo entitled you get free copy pinnacle dv . who knows how many weeks may take arrive . it also required you cut upc off box --- not something i'm happy doing until i'm positive i won't returning camera store picking out different one . if digital cameras include copy adobe photoshop elements box , why can't canon make arrangements put pinnacle box too ? irritating hoop-jumping customer . third : agree other owners provided battery ( lack standalone charger ) also skinflint canon part . honestly , i'm not surprised , since pretty much every camera manufacturer i've ever seen plays let's-make-some-extra-dough-on-worthwhile-accessories game these days . ultimately , it all picture quality , i haven't disappointed this regard . took some family footage break-in camera , showed it our hi-def tv --- terrific . image stabilization worked pretty well . didn't stress camera low-light shooting , so i can't comment . agree others tiny size this camera makes lots itsy-bitsy buttons crowded together , which not everyone like . i'm getting used . now main issue learning all features . it take awhile punch your way through setup menus if you want remove date stamp , step down 1080p lower def , or anything else way configuration . ultimately processes all pretty logical , but camera so many options , expect spend some time wading	1
this really helpful use camcorder without worrying battery life	1
good price here made japan . not void warranty . one i just received amazon.com charged full reasonable time built charger my canon optura 400 . doubles time original , great backup .	1
i began child brownies graduated instamatics , wondering wonderful new technology convenience contained drop roll film cool flash . high school i progressed dark room processing ( whose magic science later served me sweltering subtropical environment ) , but still most basic cameras unless friend lent me his mamiya seikor hand held light meter . i old soviet all mechanical kgb 35 mm slr camera laying around somewhere , but my main camera which became like part me , organ my body , my canon al-1 , wonders rudimentary focus assist system aperture priority photography . canon saw me across thousands miles through nicaragua heights machu picchu , finally gave up ghost when twenty years came went duct tape couldn't hold it together anymore long lens fused body . known photographer , or one who taken pictures , its draw backs , people ask you latest technology . mountains nicaragua eighties new tourists asked me how their latest point shoot knew which iso set . i no idea . more recently people handed me their digital point shoots , tiny cellphones , i no idea lingering commitment roll film true photography , full sized slr only way go . i cannot grasp concept parallax which point shoots require , but must compose viewfinder i cannot control darkroom commercial color film processing . then i met this d-40being obliged buy digital price film processing soared , i searched desperately here amazon , feeling unfaithful , comparing product details , etc . which so generously given here amazon , i discovered : this d-40 all camera you ever need forever , case closed ( course i felt same my canon ) . i now once again sleep my slr literally , its manual i commit memory . this camera really more than you ever need , since it behind latest wave its price very reasonable generous . number megapixels more than sufficient enlargement , cropping details while recomposing . fact , camera its own darkroom , it allows you crop otherwise alter adjust all aspects images , including going sepia tones , dump them printer or your computer , without need further graphics programs . full functions camera quickly become intuitive , its easily accessible ergonomic buttons switches menu screens , one who used no more than mainly mechanical slr years loved it , this d-40 truly magical well beyond my needs , desires imaginings . it everything more . i strongly suggest you get very inexpensive 55-200 mm long lens designed this camera series . watch full description lens sure it fully compatible all this camera features . before going outside , you learned your first photogrpahy class , sure get uv lens filter , or other filter , mainly protect lens scratches world your fingertip oils . sure get semi-soft camera case which ample enough cover surprisingly short long lens . also hunt around best price sd memory cards , which you want several , which very inexpensive here amazon . if you afford it get extra rechargeable battery carry your case , get plug transformer use where plug available long service required . pick up remote control device all rest bells whistles while available , but essentially get long lens , lens filters , sd cards , semi soft case . also get great all around technique refresher book like understanding exposure ( see my review there please ) . one surprisingly expensive accessory speedlight flash attachment . i got sticker shock seeing price these nowadays , one angles , etc . we used get these used next nothing , but now i'd get lens instead ! any case built pop-up flash d-40 serves most any flash situations without annoying red eye assist , etc ., even good distance ( ever seen those folks football game stand up try fill stadium their disposable flash or their cellphone ? or stand more than twelve feet away ? ) . i normally go ambient light no matter how long exposure , suffused effect , so rarely use flash . so i glad learn flash suppressed " fully automatic no flash " mode , well other modes , but it there pop up whenever people require you " take my picture " under unfavorable conditions very comforting . this great all around camera also wonderfully implemented specific skills . only con mentioned elsewhere i agree regarding three point automatic focus system which focusses nearest object . i lean law thirds myself so lock focus recompose viewfinder , or think cropping later . obviously focussing points set up favor exact center , which death any photograph . but hey , work around this already ! you cannot go wrong this camera . i mention ample rear screen , full color , which permits zooming very closely check your focus , etc ., which scrolls through several functional menu screens ? it everything more , including settings aperture priority ( even if you not manual aperture ring your lens , you it through camera itself ) , shutter priority , etc . etc . etc . if you feel there something this camera cannot , mentioned other reviews , just read manual ( we used interesting acronym early days pc ) you discover this camera fact it all more . you set this up so every iota information regarding focal length , shutter speed , aperture , etc ., etc ., gets saved photo instead jotting it down pad , thus you even see iso altered automatically fit conditions . no more blowing off roll 100 iso before nightfall just take low light pictures oil lamp iso 800 using it up before daybreak . you also set iso instead automatically switching it shot shot camera wills . i not yet tried setting iso 1600 see if it comes out ethereally grainy film when first marketted twenty years ago . got some great shots people places way . i suppose dslr it simply grants greater latitude low light situations without flash . but i see no pressing need button dedicated directly only adjusting iso mentioned review . i trust d-40 processor make decision . that what i pay it . me , i am too concerned keeping those kids focus frame , or wild bird spooking soon , or flower getting lost too great depth field , or holding my breath while soaking altar lit candles wishing i brought my tripod , or least monopod . truly this camera get , especially this falling price , but sure protect it lens filters case , read manual !	1
i got this camera ' cause i sick tired compact cameras simply not deliver quality photos . when i first got it i pleasantly surprised , you simply put lens camera took great pictures you ! everything i could only dream compact camera came this beautiful instrument . auto mode perfect everyday use , other modes great messing around getting great photos process . i would definitely recommend this camera anyone who willing step up get their first real camera	1
fun easy use .. this one best dslr beginning photographer ! grand canyon here i come ! oh know this not bracketing lenses super pricey ( new lens must motor built since camera body not one )	1
i bought this my florida trip . it worked perfectly while i doing snorkeling . well this what it . but also , when i use it my air boat ride , it worked well too . i wouldn't say i enjoyed see other camcorders got wet but i happy i my protected . pro : easy using , what it says it . con : needed weight keep unit stable under water . it hard hold it when too close surface while windy	1
i bought these binoculars month ago using it since . this pair all it promises , if not much more . unit solid feel not look cheapy . images 10x crisp but when you go 30x they get tad dull given 25mm lenses ( i wont blame olympus this one since it not fault , just way cut size costs . 50mm way go if you dont mind size ) . i would've given it 5 stars it not zoom-lever ; lever sticks just bit when i zoom max almost giving " grindy " feeling . couple minor desirable features i'd like see added : 1 ) tripod support - if you steady hands you fine but 30x even slightest shakes make image look blurry . 2 ) lens caps - given these babies cost me $80 i'd like see pair caps object lenses . i buy something 50mm objective lenses variable zoom if they came less bulkier	1
this one very nice . you clearly see difference picture without this light . this works great . this must compatible camcorders . i used this hc42 campcorder	1
one word terrific . this not much review you few notes those who thinking buying it , who experience canon minidv camera such gl1 or gl2 ( or any other minidv camcorder ) . i wondered if xh a1 shot sd ( standard dv ) well hdv . it . i went through many articles not finding this called canon . so this means you sell your old model minidv camera ( mine gl1 -- used gl1 fetching $1200 ebay . ) still access , read , upload download your standard 4:3 minidv tapes . not touch lcd display . you actually see it daylight which great . but very careful not touch screen finger . i brushed corner mine got shiny spot . what nice lcd display viewfinder work same time . one very minor but annoying problem manual . would you believe it doesn't tell you how turn it . unlike my gl1 which on/off switch , this power dial . no where manual it tell you , you push tiny button 3 o'clock dial then turn it turn thing . if you need capture footage you shot older canon minidv camera xh a1 realize play your old tape its correct taped forma t.t he camera works well final cut studio . change capturing minidv capturing hdv i just use easystepup final cut that it . i used use soft case my gl1 . this heavier camera i switched hard vanguard vgp-32 . it perfect size this camera sizeable foam tight fit . one big surprise me battery . it goes inside camera , huge last 7 hours . now , i'm still just getting used it , but so far i just love it . p.s. there lot more bells whistles this than my old gl2 , many which not covered manual . instance under lcd screen speaker you use listen audio you've taped ( just like my old gl1 ) . next hole marked reset . reset button not covered manual . my horror speaker suddenly stopped working . speaker not listed index . i get it working again . i went menu set audio setting back default . somehow i changed settings without knowing it . so , keep mind there lot learn here .	1
this camcorder super easy use . we set it take wide screen movies ( 16:9 ) , so when we recording , we simply remove disk place it right into dvd player watch it tv . my kids love instant viewing their movies . this camcorder also allow you take still pictures captured memory stick . this function saves you carrying camera camcorder . we only this camcorder one month , but we took it vacation very happy it .	1
we looked every differnet camera out there this seemed best what we wanted . its small lightweight , very easy use i think digital pictures came out pretty well . pretty decent clarity . we really didn't bring our digital camera us . this seems all one camera . discs also easy use format . we used cnet check out alot actually ordered off amazon next day shipping it still cheaper than best buy . ordered 8 pm it next day noon . overall- great camera	1
this outstanding camera . very easy use pretty good battery life . i picked up sony accessory kit same time even " back up " battery kit lasts 90 minutes full charge . this camera all best available features ( night shot , good image stabilization , functional touch-screen menus , name few ) . video quality lp mode not very good , so don't expect get more than 30 minutes shooting out minidvd . however , sp mode provides really good quality , so you don't worry cutting your time down 20 minutes ( which time you get out one dvd highest quality mode ) . what i'd warn potential buyers dvd camcorders general , rather than any problem camera . someone who not intimately familiar wide variety camcorders ( who tired my panasonic dv camcorder not recording properly ) , i considered minidvd option ideal . however , i learned two things after finishing my first dvd . 1 . you need special software ( dvd video editing software or dvd copy software or both ) anything other than copy one minidvd minidvd . additionally , software like roxio mydvd doesn't work well vob file format used camcorder . all video minidvd saved into single file . this means video editors know how ( patience ) trim down video make different chapters . chapters show up finalized dvd camera , but dvd copy software won't reproduce menu you , either . 2 . if you want play back your videos something other than camcorder , make sure your dvd player relatively new . ours 6 years old didn't recognize dvd-r valid disk . now i know , this seems pretty logical , but when i popped my first disk into my player , expecting see my daughters playing , i sorely disappointed find player wouldn't anything disk . however , there some fairly inexpensive players out there now recognize all dvd formats , so this isn't huge problem . it just something you need aware . all , dvd505 great camera . those seriously interested dvd editing , unless you really know what you're doing , you may want consider sticking dv tapes awhile	1
best part protectors easy apply . no more finger prints or smudges	1
ditto .... lcd cracked no apparent reasonsent it canon illinoisawaiting outcome repairgood overall camera , but no low battery signa	1
my wife i bought this camera 6 months ago upgrade aging kodak 2mb . i am pretty much " automatic settings " guy whereas my wife loves use manual settings , change iso , shutter speed etc . this camera perfect both us picture quality amazing . i somewhat sceptical reading other reviews display cracking but , fingers crossed , not any problems . movie feature very very impressive , highest quality good enough transfer dvd . would advise you get 1gb ultra fast card really benefit cameras features . only complaints software comes camera image editing terribly outdated looks like something used windows 3.1 transfer via cable quite fiddly leaving you wonder if door usb cable socket camera would break over use . we bought universal sd card reader take card out itself then transfer pc . there no battery indicator which ridiculous . suddenly camera says " low battery " then shuts off . get yourself battery spare . whoever left this feature camera canon should fired . download free picasa image software . much better than adobe photo album canon software included box	1
this camera case stylish , compact fun ! aware there not much extra space inside store camera cards , definetely not room extra batteries . there plenty larger camera cases purpose ; this camera case stepping out style	1
bought this go pink camera i bought my 12 yr old daughter xmas . nicely made , protects camera it looks cute !	1
adds so much freedom my regular shooting ... sure makes my job easier able get wider view more creative shots because it . definatelly good investment	1
i went through g-series powershot cameras probably owner one first batch g1s imported . still love them , especially 420ex speedlight mounted top . alas , i needed pocketable digital camera so went a710is . i get excellent pictures it , even auto , several non-photographers i've suggested it amazed how many more excellent shots they get . its good . i two beefs it . pocketable means pocketable : 1 ) need add-on flash because built-in one only good 11 feet instead 18 feet . 2 ) need case because lcd doesn't reverse storage like others canon product line . canon not it quite right yet	1
i several digital cameras , many brands but i must say casio exilim ex-z600bk one best ultra digital cameras market . pros : fast operationbig , bright lcdgreat bodynice picturescons : no viewfinderno manual controlsadditional comments : lookrating : camera looks it online images . its nice dark , glossy black but doesn't smudge or keep finger prints easily . sizerating : 5/5its very tiny . you hide it clasping your hands . feelrating : 5/5its great feel . buttons small but not awkward . its light too . you hardly feel it yout pocket but its balanced comfortable hold . this camera practically perfect . this honest review . its great value money . i recommend it .	1
i chose this casio because price , good sho t-t o-shot speed , most important me charging cradle battery life . i got so tired running out battery middle day . all cameras should charging cradle , just like your cordless telephones	1
i don't think anybody going pretend little casio exilim ex-z600 6.0 mega pixel camera best camera ever built or takes best pictures world . but under $[ ... ] , it hard beat everything advertised . size perfect , one smallest , slimmest cameras made , easily fitting into one [ ... ] pocket , even when enclosed small case . viewing screen probably biggest brightest you'll find , so aiming shooting easy it . range modifications ( size , contrast , sharpness , saturation , etc . ) taking managing pictures seems almost endless , yet various menus camera offers simple navigate . camera docking stand makes downloading pictures one computer well charging up camera snap . moreover , according casio , single charge afford one up 500 or more snaps . picture quality ? it perhaps not absolutely clear well defined , even its maximum six mega pixels , best cameras ; although , fair , best cameras often cost three-to-four times much this one . so , far i'm concerned , i've no complaints , pictures i've taking delight eye . z600 makes picture-taking fun again	1

one obvious unexplainable omission details reviews here dimensions this unit . not including external pocket they approx . 11 " long 4 " deep 8 " tall ( external ) . padding approx . 3/8 " thick . " false bottom " approx . 2-1/2 " tall completely removable . there one spacer top area secure camera large , velcro enclosured , pocket one side . " rattling around " earlier reviewers camera would , i surmise , eliminated proper use adjustment internal camera spacer . external pocket 9-1/2 " long 6 " tall 1-1/4 " deep . it 2 opening pouch one side other zippered net . i bought this case dcr-trv20 . it replacing smaller unit , although it snug fit , allowed inclusion very few our ever growing selection accessories . i am now able comfortably carry charging unit ( under false bottom ) , external light unit , several tapes remote . i could easily fit additional lens if necessary . these obviously bulk cargo plenty room small incidentals various compartments . everything this unit screams h*e*a*v*y d*u*t*y ! heavy grade , woven nylon semi-rigid casing reinforced handle heavy , solid metal zipper pulls , strap clips flap closure . my previous case well built unit held up admirably through four years use . it also cost much this sony case . however , sony case obvious step up craftsmanship quality . top all , my camera my camera bag finally match ! awesome purchase , incredible price . thanks amazon ! ** update**checking back this review , i see reviewers still giving poor review this bag based fact their camera doesn't fit properly . although this valid issue , i feel it gives bag bad rap because bag itself lives up all reasonable expectations . listings amazon providing these camera accessories seems best generous truth , quite often erroneous . regardless where they acquiring their information , it their own writers or sony itself , list cameras each item often inaccurate . example , i purchased external light my camera based list here claiming it would work me . actuality , light specifically designed different battery type than my camera uses would require adapter mount shoe mount different size . additional research showed i needed different light altogether specifically designed my camera . although light " would work " my unit , amount effort added expense required utilize it unacceptable . my point here , although listings here often innacurate , item itself receives bad rap when we give poor reviews based specifically inaccurate listing not actual performance unit . it my belief these reviews should generally reflect actual performance item . if necessary , any experience poor or innaccurate listings should , all means , highlighted . adhering these guidlines , we actually improve descriptions items researching reviews , make much more informed decisions . just my 2 cents issue . also , after busy summer ton use , my case still looks works good new . -d	1
i got this camera love it , except one thing . microphone input jack not work . so i am sending it back i need this external mic . everything else better than expected . this zr500 dropping prices right now , so now good time buy . i now get zr830 only few dollars more than i zr500 . zr500 not usb connector so you'll use firewire , which cost me few extra dollars . zr600 i " believe " usb connection direct your computer so i would say buy zr600	1
this camera takes fantastic photos . it resolution great . waterproof one it greatest assets . i highly reccommend this camera . just get li-42b battery extend time ( approx 2 hrs ) camera provided battery only lasts 20 minutes . i love this camera . using hi-definition printer , it prints photos comparable developing lab	1
i error message my i checked canon website found they recall it , i sent it they fixed it free . check website call provided phone number even if you don't see your problem listed , eventually they might other recalls all complains .	1
color much better than kodak max 400 speed pictures much clearer	1
i purchased this camera before our trip hawaii , not repented ... it delivers clear photos , very flexible set pre-programmed settings ... must purchase folks move	1
i am very pleased this camera .... i yet use it 10 feet under water but maybe someday ... i love compact durability this camera . picture quailty excellent !!! very happy photographer	1
i've this camera two months now i really like it . fact it image stabilization means i yet take blurry picture . also , zoom quite impressive . nifty feature you overlay grid help photo composition(the " rule thirds " ) . only caveat this camera lack optical viewfinder , so you can't really turn off lcd save battery power . i never batteries die out me , so i don't really consider it problem , although you may	1
i got this camera when price it took nosedive . i found i wasn't carrying my powershot s2 around outdoors much because size issue . this one i bring anywhere . picture quality low iso just good best superzoom cameras , leica lens gives very clear rendition any scene . build quality fantastic , solid metal large , bright high resolution screen . focus times decent , par other superzooms . lens hardly extends outward all , folded optics really shrink footprint camera . however ..... shooting indoors or high iso issue entirely . noise big problem above iso 100 . flash pathetically weak . iso 80 , flash only rated around 3 feet ! this not camera indoors or low light . movie mode decent , but nothing write home . widescreen 848x480 mode interesting , but overall quality couple steps down powershot s2 or s3 . sound especially weak comparison . positive note , you zoom during filming . tz line cameras designated " travel " . if you plan using this camera ( well lit outdoors ) , it great choice . all one solution , i can't fully recommend it .	1
camera works great even though it refirbished unit . however it not come complete . it missing adapter ring now out production.buy.com, fuji other locations not ring . my bad buying out date camera sale	1
easy share dock great little device delivering everything promised . my one complaint , albeit minor , entire " easy share " system kodak might wonderful someone new digital photography . it would very useful newbie storing pictures pc hard drive , cd or dvd , but i found software folder stucture contrary way i things . " its way " isn't flexible enough allow me continue various picture tasks my way . after using easyshare download pictures camera via dock , i always move files around suit way i've things several years . dock , i'd recommend it anyone . it nice unit .	1
easy use understand , quality , keeps camera fully charged all time	1
product works well only when used without flash unit . if flash operates it creates shadow finished photo . when used sufficient light without flash unit this lens delivers quality photos	1
useful reconditioning batteries losing their charge .	1
regular batteries caused my camera need repair . independent repairman stressed only use kodak batteries . sometimes it worth it pay name brand	1
i've seen some bad digital frames- ones stretch out picture , making everyone look fat , or dim displays bad color . philips frame absolutely opposite : it delightfully easy use picture quality great . pictures automatically sized , cropped , even rotated when you turn frame . i didn't need software they included . i just dumped pile pictures cf card ( using my camera wired computer ) then plugged card into frame . menus frame navigated little joystick back . it not nicest menu system , but i got hang it pretty quickly . if you buying this grandma ( course ) here tip : buy two memory cards so you switch photo albums when you visit	1
we ordered this product retirment present co-worker who leaving week so we even fed ex shipping . product kept showing up order status never updated until almost week later when it delivered . product arrived excellent condition but we wondering if it ever shipped ... amazon or retailer needs update shipping info instead leaving product showing order status not shipped	1
i wanted small case my new digiital camera , not like those offered fuji . no offense fuji , i just didn't need all bells ans whistles you include . this little case great alternative . it holds my camera , couple memory cards , spare batteries like glove ! there strap back case used belt clip , or i , wrist strap . my only complaint shoulder strap not removable . all all , i am very happy my purchase .	1
i've using this camera few months now , so far i'm very happy my purchase . main factor me deciding camera quality pictures . a430 delivers 4mp . amateur like me , this not seem like much . actually it seems outdated compared other cameras out there . but once photos taken , i amazed clarity resolution . resolution more than enough amateurs/hobbyists (?) . colors vibrant sharp , although there some noise/grains blacks . plus , you record movies ... sound ! quality videos isn't spectacular but gets job ( rather grainy 640 mode [ largest ]); it not something you'd make movie , but perfect places like youtube . i believe you get ~ 15 minutes 1gb 640x480 . so someone who takes pictures just fun , it nearly everything you'd want . pros : great pictures : high-res , vibrant , clear ; good flashgood body constructioneasy use ( low-med learning curve)awesome battery life ( rechargeables)good video feature cameracons : bulky ( much more than it seems ) ( i suggest a500 series when it sale [ slimmer profile])small screenslowdowns when zooming movingthings note : i suggest least 512mb memory . much , you take many pictures you want without feeling constricted . memory really cheap now . brands such sandisk too costly - there much cheaper alternative same size card , same quality ( buy online ) .	1
i this one before it stolen so i replaced it same thing because it just what i needed . great clear shots , user friendly , downloads without problems , feels good hand , small light . if i lose this one i'll buy same one again	1
if you looking point shoot turn out some great photos little effort , go no further . this camera 4x zoom , which hard find this price range , plus enough megapixels good looking 8x10 . there also some neat artsy features like color swap color accent ( everything black white except one specified color .... very fun fool around ) . i am very satisfied this product , use it almost daily . give it try , it not dissapoint	1
although they weren't packed securely -- just loose box -- bushnell falcon binoculars work well served us well . my wife especially enjoyed them huge 92,000 seat stadium university georgia football games . they functioned very well , sharp image no mechanical problems . we enjoyed them very much , i would recommend them others	1
this fixed 10x -- not zoom . didn't realize when i bought ... even so , it works fine price . using this , suburbs , i able see ( albeit faintly ) andromeda galaxy orion nebula . i can't wait try out somewhere countryside ... these useful but course , now i am left wanting more	1
it compact , well designed easy use , plus it charges batteries rapidly - full charge hour or less batteries seem last all day , unless subjected lot flashes	1
support system background paper funcioned expected . plants i photographed beautiful , without background clutter . great value	1
i purchased this camera assuming it would shoot like slr size still makes it packable like point-and-shoot . most part , it . i upgraded older , simpler powershot s400 , hoping get back some manual control my old film slr days . certainly manual aperture shutter speed modes ( which use attractive on-screen display dial ring back body ) very accessible convenient . setting lower than 2.8 would certainly nice , however . what i didn't expect making so much use auto program modes ... silly me , that probably what i paid all $$$ first place . face recognition , advanced metering capability really helped some tricky shooting situations . you wow your friends face tracking screen subject or camera moves ... most noticeable drawback ( this previously mentioned ) high noise tiny ccd 0.01 gigapixels crammed into it . it really pretty bad some situations . very careful not forget leave camera higher iso mode , or pictures ( even daylight ) ruined graininess . true , you'll get some photo higher iso modes you would not gotten otherwise , but result bit disappointment . props go out superb job image stabilization . seems like that where investment really paid off ( me canon ) . steady hand-held position , 1/15 shutter speeds not present problem ( i recommend snapping off couple shots though , just ot sure ) . non-shooting side , options available manage selectively delete pictures stored sd card very good . i especially happy see i could clip videos down desired length right there camera . who wants carry hundred mb video , when all you want 10 seconds that clip ? nice job . strange/annoying feature ( haven't figured out how disable it ) if you zoom image view it , delete it or move onto next image card , camera holds zoom previous level last image . sort odd . battery life fine , compared other camera i've owned . camera this size , it seems like they could worked little harder fit aa into it . overall , i see this camera i going get fine . it fits my old camera pouch i used carry my sd400 around . it shoots awesome pictures daylight , well low light long i my hand steady i don't b*tch too much graininess . prices look like they're starting come down , i'd say it steal $400 if anyone wants wait	1
i rebel xt lenses , flashes , etc . my wife wanted small easy use camera so i got her this her birthday . she got it last night up all night taking pictures around house experimenting wide range options available . first she thought camera too complicated but after staying up all night using it , she living it . professional photographer , this camera great i may steal it events quick way take some pictures . it all features super resolution make great companion ( long she lets me take it ) highly recommended anyon	1
i all sorts research sd600 . i made up my mind sd600 camera me . sd1000 newer kid block therefore not many reviews . why i am here today . sd1000 newest version sd600 few additions . those few additions make this camera awesome . i love iso choices . i zooming my local calif . freeways around 80mph decided take few shots passing signs out my passenger window . high speed iso caught such great detail i could clearly read sign later home . means despite small size camera filtered out shake my hand , shake road , compensated fast movement . color options very much same other canon powershot models . macro so much fun play this camera . button layout easy figure out . lighting options like white balance button push away . face detection option you sure get great photo family . i playing it none stop over week . get least gig memory . only downside i found , it minor one , when battery warning comes it means you 1-2 more pics then it shuts off . i ordered battery ahead time it worth it . batteries charge 30-40mins . this great camera . if you thinking sd600 step up get sd1000 . you not disappointed it	1
i love this camera . it handy , goes my purse everywhere . sure it isn't canon rebel or remotely like it , but it fast fast fast , holds charge , takes great wide angle shot takes superb macros . i don't use movie feature but it it . there lot offer this little camera . i people stop me all time ask what brand it . buy it happy :	1
this my fifth digital camera , i like it best far . it also cheapest . it my first wide-angle my first silver-not-black : someone else said , i don't see how i would ever go back non-wide-angle after this ; but i wish mine black . i noticed colors faded fluorescent light , but macro it excellent -- much better than more expensive camera i already bought macro purposes ( canon . ) i also love battery , which seems last forever . i bought replacement lenmar battery which also great , cheap , but it got some bad reviews because it described wrong model camera , not fx-01 . ( if you read customer reviews , you figure out which one right one you . ) i problems understanding display , which shows options don't correspond any place camera you select options . ( i guess i should look manual . ) also , i don't like software decided not download it all . i bought this because i wanted camera made computer company much camera company , , i wanted it work . also , someone sent me email history leica , how they saved lot jews concentration camps . other nice thing this camera i use it lot more because i carry it me every day : it tiny battery always works , so why not ? graininess , my desktop pics look fine , i would not raving this camera if it not very easy take good pics -- but i admit i haven't used it printed pics so far	1
i've purchased this battery ' cause i usually take hundreds pictures long sports events i needed second battery so i could take all pictures i want . i'm very happy this product ' cause power last hours hours i re-charge it short period time . i've used this one year i'm still satisfied it	1
this got one easiest telescope imager/camera around . this imager goes place eyepiece images instantly appear laptop computer screen . included image processing software very user friendly . driver loads quickly seconds . it very exciting see astro images moon details lunar craters . ccd chip highly sensitive gives you excellent detail even low light conditions . photographic magnification this imager gives you remarkable 150x . i not tried it jupiter but i am certain i won't disappointed . great purchase	1
great camera start off . i didn't get mine amazon , found it cheaper elsewhere , but anyways my parents 5385 so just getting it i knew some stuff ahead time , like it eats batteries , even rechargables(maybe i got some bad batteries who knows ) , best thing i've found solve this energizer squared batteries , they hold up . why doesn't it come power cord ?... way you turn off lcd , all you press ok button back like 2 or 3 times it switches through one them it turns off . most part only real problem i it placement on/off button i'm afraid it might accidentaly get turned but i keep it case provided prevent ... so yeah 5 stars	1
camera great . manual tells you how use it awful . also it didn't come picture card-surprise ! dealer i bought it mailed it out right away price good	1
i got 750 more than 1 year ago love it . i purchased 850 my relative . it also great product	1
product advertised genuine panasonic ; it fully met my expectations performs well	1
product comes 4 aaa batteries which seem work fine . charger itself four places where you charge either aaa or aa batteries . i haven't measured time it takes charge , but 1hour seems right ( according what they claim ) . there two leds which change red ( charging ) green ( finished ) . charger small enough take you if you want , or store away unobtrusively drawer . plug folds into charger when not use approximately size cigarette pack ( little bigger actually ) . i've using this 2 months without any problems	1
this camera takes great pictures all time . i haven't one picture turned out bad . it also very easy use there lots fun things you it . i would recommend this camera anyone	1
i've canon digital cameras past two years my first , opted purchase accompanying canon camera case . though it good fit , it couple flaws caused me look elsewhere case when i got my second digital camera this year . this time around , i chose tamrac case because , unlike canon , it zips closed . canon flap closure creates two big gaps either side case , allowing small particles get inside camera itself . second , tamrac features not only belt loop , like canon , but nice shoulder strap . this means user carry camera hands free without put it purse or backpack . this case fits many small film slim digital cameras ( go tamrac website download spec sheet lists camera/case compatability ) , so don't expect custom fit . my canon a510 , this case bit long side , but no so much so i concerned it shifting around too much case . it good bag great manufacturer decent price . recommended	1
product easy use accurate . it also great buy	1
this camera great . i haven't used wifi component yet ( because you need t-mobile plan ) i've heard all types reviews it . otherwise , camera works great . many complaining flash function but i never problem it . blur reduction could sharper but , its good regardless . i highly recommend this camera . it sleek design works great	1
i've only it week , but i'm already up speed most features . luv touch screen navigation intuitive menus . online manual better than print version . now i'm movie director one easy lesson my own editing pc . take three still photos while recording video ! extra battery	1
i bought camera use trip lake tahoe , nv . scenery beautiful camera so easy operate i got lots wonderful pictures . i would recommend this camera anyone who wants take great pictures without lot problems . it small easy handle	1
birthday party , vacations , casual user , this camera outstanding price . $200 , you get great resolution great color , compact size , usability you need 15 kids running around you party ! you , course , immediately need memory card before using it ( one package serves up 8 pics ! ) sandisk memory cards supercheap , i bought both 1 2 gb version , both which work great ( 2gb hold 1,000 pics ... plenty ) . program your computer little clumsy load , but within 20 minutes i program all my recent pics all loaded into my computer . awesome price , unless you professional photographer looking get published national geographic , you cannot beat value priced a550 7.1 megapixels canon name . fill your family scrapbook under $200 .	1
sorry guy who sent his camera bottom atlantic , but this product great when you read instructions ! camera case shows weight configuration needed make it your camera neutrally bouyant - when tightened it stays great camera not sink . weight kit great addition those who really going use case diving . i 6 dives it great	1
this replacement camera one lost ; it came new feature vibration reduction . my pictures come out much better - especially those taken moving vehicles ( think vacation pictures ) . i also found close-up feature much improved . quite surprise	1
it every thing , loaded features ( manual setting hard ) . slightly big size , not user freindly like coolpix 5900 preowned . very delicate , warranty not clear wheather it 1 day or 60 or 90 or 365 days i don't know ( made indonesia shocked me hopfully nothing happen)at end i am happy it , my kids happy it you don't need more than	1
camera great qualities such good price . if you read manuel , it makes it even easier camera used . camera amazon including shipping less than 200 dollars , all other cameras only 5.0 megapixel 3x optical zoom set up 300 dollars . if you care tinyness camera won't mind paying few extra hundred camera same qualities then this one isn't you .	1

i very happy product . it serves me well . fast delivery , good service vender . i large project it serve me well into future . adds my large studio lights added ability focus lighting small projects .	1
i found materials used construction photo box very nice quality . portable design well thought out . one my favorite features camera stand . this better than tripod models because it stays out way while changing subjects within box . lamps heat up very quickly . they very nice broad spectrum . however , order keep melting them i connected them power strip just flick switch my foot right when i'm going shoot photo . otherwise , what i shot this studio come out well . soft white sides take glare off anything . box well suited items small pins or large bust necklace . this least expensive photo studio i came across but i can't imagine reason recommend anything else jewelry photography	1
i can't believe they haven't made more these so hard find now ! i've mine year now it awesome . finally handy marriage still camera video camera . parents grandparents everywhere i go wish they one catch every fun moment kids . my only complaint low-light capabilities . pictures just won't turn out movies terrible unless you're outside or inside bright lights	1
i bought this case my panasonic dmc-fz30 digital camera . while i only this case week now , i am still confident this case going meet my needs well . it reminds me women purse sense there seem endless amount pockets put stuff . there even net side hold water bottle . i should no trouble fitting camer , plus lens hood other small accessories . main compartment movable divider , so i keep camera easily separated charger lens hood . review amazon questioned quality . i not used it long enough know sure , but it looks like it hold up well	1
million words written this thing , this not attempt comprehensive review , so look above or dpreview-com complete info . i looked canon , nikon , pentax sony dslrs . sony makes sense if you already bag full minolta lenses , which i don't . canon nikon put their image stabilization lens , which makes their ' good ' lenses significantly more expensive . canon eos not backward-compatible their old fd lenses , which i -do- bagful . pentax backward-compatible all k-mount lenses made since 1970s , even take 645 6x7 lenses , adapters . sooo , i set out ease into dslr ownership k100d , then started reading reviews , it bunch little things made me want k10d . viewfinder actual prism , not mirror cage like cheaper cameras , displays backlit , low-res mode ( 1800 1200px ) exactly what i want certain applications . 10 mpx , i point shoot if i , crop ( somewhat ) more later . controls more ' classic ' camera-like than ' scene modes ' beginner cameras . not say this would worth price difference everyone , but i bought k10d , pentax 12-24mm / 4.0 lens , am very happy both . digital cameras use less image projected lens , so your lenses ' longer ' than they would film camera . downside : ' journalist lens ' , buy 12-24mm , which equivalent 18-36mm film camera . upside : my old 50mm / 1.4 now equivalent top-of-the-line portrait lens i never felt i could afford . pentax plans introduce 2007 16-50mm / 2.8 50-135mm / 2.8 , which sound fantastic - but let see what they cost before we get too excited . meanwhile , sigma , tokina , tamron offer some very adequate alternatives . camera lens together pretty heavy , just like older slr , led screen cannot used live viewfinder - no image gets sensor while mirror down - so you hoist camera your eye compose shot . no problem , i'm used it , it common all dslrs . (( my personal feeling slr platform just . it hard see need mirror box digital camera , which use actual sensor compose shot through lens display it back . future top-end digital cams probably lot flatter , like old rangefinder cameras . look olympus e330 or panasonic dmc-l1 see what direction i think we should headed . )) said , i am very happy pentax k10d , it behaves it supposed , affordable ( barely ) 12-24mm rectilinear lens unthinkable just few years ago . this camera ton half features capabilities , i am still sorting them out . there definitely learning curve if you get most out camera , but there also two full program modes , including ' green zone ' , so you start shooting right away good results . pictuers come out great . colors , brightness , contrast need almost no adjustment or photoshop-ing , which not true any other digi-cam i ever owned . happy this , until next big thing comes	1
i owned * ist dl 8 month bought this upgrade . i don't any experience cannon or nikon . so my review mostly based comparison * ist dl . hope this help those same situation . i am not pro not pro . so i only need decent but inexpensive camera handful choice lenses . i bought k10d mainly ( 1 ) shake reduction ( 2 ) dust removal ( 3 ) raw button ( 4 ) 10mb ccd . course , there plenty other features expect . this pice level , i think k10d beats cannon nikon any others . plus , i da 50-200mm couple m42 takumar manual lenses . sticking pentax best me . after 150 test shots , i share you some my opinions : pros : -- shake reduction great ( but it its limit) -- dust removal comes handy -- raw button very useful -- manual choice any one 11 focus points , great composition -- faster focus than * ist dl -- rich functions , e.g. sv mode , program line -- support iso 100cons : -- weather-seal not mean too much if you don't get weather-sealed lenses -- 10m not much bigger than 6m (* ist dl ) , it good but don't expect big difference ( but this not pentax or k10d problem) -- battery meter drop full empty without stopping half-empty status -- pentaprism viewfinder not brighter than pentamirror my * ist dl ( least no noticable difference) -- shutter release not crispy * ist dl ( just personal feeling)it bigger heavier than ist dl . great ergo design . i am happy k10d . i take one star off cons listed . ps : ccd/stablizer slides inside ( even power off ) when you flip camera . little scary when i first got it . but after some reading i think it " normal " .	1
i loved lens cleaner kit , it comes lens cleaner bottle , moist lens cleaner cloths , lens cloth itself ... great carrying case those moments when carrying camera u need clean your lens fast , effective way .	1
reason i purchased this camera delay how long it takes actually take picture after pushing shutter button . every other camera i tried this price range unnaceptable . coolpix series reasonable level performance shutter delay . now i camera , used it , i am impressed how easy it use , it performance . however , this camera kill batteries if you use flash , but it takes good pictures flash turned off , batteries last lot longer way . no glare or uneven lighting too!i've using alkaline batteries , so i don't know recommended ni/mh type , but if you use alkalines i recommend when batteries stop working camera , save batteries use mini-mag flashlight(or other device ) they not really run down all way judging how much light i get my mini-mag , they're only 50% when camera decides stop working	1
this camera flaws may irritate more seasoned adept photographers than me . however , amateur looking room grow , this camera great value money . i drawn s5100 because its automatic manual settings . i figured i could slowly learn how use more advanced functions while still able take photos . 10x optical zoom major bonus . colors fade bit full zoom , so you won't get same terrific , sharp images lower magnifications , but it still beats heck out point-and-shoot 3x optical zoom cameras . i've owned s5100 over year , though i love it , it few significant shortcomings : 1 . while it takes beautiful pictures bright sunlight , indoor non-flash pictures taken without aid tripod often blurry . s5100 takes some beautiful night shots ( tripod ) , however . 2 . shutter speed automatic settings slow , start-up once you turn it takes too long . also , if you turn camera off , then immediately turn it again , it often won't turn . you need wait beat after turning it off before turning it again . it not annoying because you don't often need immediately turn it back after turning it off . 3 . view-finder digital , not optical . when you look through it , you're seeing digital image , not actually looking through lens . i find it difficult see image viewfinder , so i only use lcd screen . unfortunately , lcd screen hard see when it very sunny . 4 . it hard take incognito shots , because camera makes lot noise ( beeping when it turns , artificial film-camera-type " click " when it takes photo ) . said , i love this camera would buy it again . i live overseas often post photos my travels online send friends relatives back home . they always ooh ah over my photos frequently ask what sort camera i . s5100 offers lot bang buck	1
i read through all reviews here amazon , best one rueffer . he accurately explains how get best output frame , i followed his instructions my pictures display perfect no black sidebars . compact flash compatibility great , so usb port , although usb drive sticking out looks sort ugly , so compact flash or sd card way go . i managed put 1000+ pictures 128mb card if you follow instructions rueffer sizing them down . only reason i gave this frame 4/5 because mp3 compatibility works fine , but it would great if it could play simultaneously while showing pictures . however , music plays separately , which kind silly . overall , price , this great frame it works fine last month i've it	1
digital picture frame very good display very easy use i purchased one some time ago bought this one christmas gift . it well worth cost	1
but you take some pretty darn good pictures , very good video . definatly not evening or night time ... it needs light- lots it . i found it very usefull fun . it needs memory card ! it only hold like two songs without memory card , just few pics . just buy cheap card you fit alot more various medias you store . i really no complaints this except maybe i wish it worked night	1
i this lens 3 years . it never let me down - it amazing macro range . i use this lens portraits models well nature close-ups . this lens designed film format cameras , so shooting it digital gives you sweet spot lens circle covering digital sensor . highly recommended . only negative thing i think this lens i wish it f/ 2.8 aperture instead f/ 3.5 - 4.5 ...	1
this great starter camera if you thinking getting into videograghy . this camera give you pro look , but it seems just consumer level camera pro package . quality seems very good however , i only shot few hrs tape so far . if you come up extra $1000 seriously consider different camera really pro level	1
lot softer than i thought it going but very nice . job very well	1
feels like it made cardboard ? nonsense !! structure made very rigid plastic panels covered some kind synthetic material textured - - supposedly - - look like surface camera . camera barely fits into case - - but this good thing , because it keeps small size camera intact . overpriced ? all sony accessories always overpriced ; get over it . if you buy this camera - - which i recommend - - then you need this case	1
i purchased this camera my sixteen year old niece . it only 3.2 mp so picture quality isn't good 5.0 mp , however , 3.2 mp above average quality . this great starter camera young person or teenager . it compact , easy use menu items , cool charger base . batteries run out little too fast but so ones my expensive 5.0 mp camera . it nature beast ... person who wrote review pictures dark didn't turn flash . flash must turned low light . if they read directions , they would figured out . once flash turned pictures come out perfect . don't hesitate buy this affordable camera someone starter . it great device . i gave this " 4 " stars because price , features , slim body . i thought " 5 " stars too high because it not serious picture taker , it great " first " camera .	1
this battery i use my e-volt 500 . i've impressed i've never needed change it mid-session . what more there say ? it battery that reliable job well	1
this battery shoots shoots shoots ! i used it ten days faily heavy shooting it up challenge . it much , much better than buying alkaline batteries	1
1 . i ordered this very close christmas . data said there would three five business day delay . binoculars mailed out next day . i recieved notice mailing they arrived time christmas . i am very impressed . 2 . they shipped carefully arrived good shape	1
i recently went new york found it quiet amazing watch things empire state building . it not adjustability but than mentioned product description . price it goes it definitely very good product	1
seldom i bought anything fulfilled my expectations extent this kodak v610 . simplicity it menu buttons , it many modes shooting person master controls one sitting bit experimentation . 2 gig sd card you get 1056 pics full resolution or 56 minutes tv quality video sound . stitch panarama mode effortless fun . would great scenics real estate work . i most like it " portability which fulfills first rule photography , " bring camera " . it fits easily any pocket . like any light weight camera it impossible hold steady long telephoto shots which 10x optical 4x digital allows . however fixed tripod . steady shot video mode however work quite well . pictures crisp color clean , great pics ! also love large clear lcd monitor framing grid allowing me look professional taking shots . so many good things built i could get writers cramp extolling it " virtues , so i end saying i am way more than pleased my new camera .	1
i love large number photos available . course amazon customer service excellent . even free shipping very quick	1
two years ago christmas , my husband gave me kodak easyshare photo printer . i absolutely love it . ( fyi - you don't kodak camera use this printer . i fuji . ) my first big print photo christmas cards . i took fun , casual photo kids i liked better than anything i'd ever store photography studio . i could print out many photo cards i wanted , cost much , much less than what it would cost me " professional " christmas cards . i made my own christmas photo again this year ! time purposes alone , it saves me time spent running store every time i take some photos . ( which often . ) not mention considerable amount time i used spend standing line . convenience sake , it no-brainer . example , i putting together portfolio last-minute homeschool evaluation needed photo or two highlight my daughter progress . all i turn my easyshare printer press " print . " i'm getting ready put together photo display my son wedding . how nice browse through my collection photos , scan older non-digital ones i want print them i need them , or just simply press " print " my more recent digital collection . no matter when i need photo , i ability print it immediately . quality wonderful , fun watch it prints out first yellow , then layers blue , then red . cartridges paper matched so when you've printed 40 photos , it time new cartridge . you always enough paper cartridges ; you always enough cartridges paper . after year use , printer started trouble grabbing photo paper . i contacted kodak ; they gave me instructions how clean printer . my husband cleaned printer per instructions , it working perfectly once again . i always buy ph160 count cartridge w/paper my printer . first all , because it lots cheaper than 40 or 80 count . secondly , i lot scrapbooking , i use lots photos . buying kodak ph160 cartridges w/paper amazon saves me big bucks . amazon usually it much less than retail . i've checked . if you keep eye it , amazon frequently sell it much less than retail . since this item cost over $25 , there no shipping . , there no sales tax . i guess over course owning printer , i've spent , average , 25 cents per photo . i print what i want , when i want it . great deal !	1
excellent product great value price . product easy use photo quality great	1
just came back orlando vacation it . i am very impressed video still picture quality . non-pro consumer , i think it perfect product	1
i received sony hdr-hc7 over two weeks ago . this hd camcorder 3rd final piece my hd makeover . first component sony kds-r60xbr2 1080p tv , second ps3 , now new camcorder . one thing i noticed immediately upon playing my older home-made dv videos big screen really amplifies lower resolution ( which bad ) , hand jitter home movies more problematic well look . both these deficiencies prompted me go this hd camcorder optical stabilization . impressions after using this camcorder different locations ( snow , indoor , beach ): pros -- video great , especially filling 60 inch screen . images look smooth , not always necessarily eye-popping sharp , but very pleasing . clip arcade beach its many sounds especially many bright colors made very rich video experience big screen . - still images excellent . 6.1 megapixels , they good any 6 mp still camera ( i comparison ) . my test still cameras print 8x10 glossies . when you , it easy judge excellent , good , not-so-good . 8x10 prints excellent . moreover , camera 10x optical zoom , so major advantage still photography . flash surprisingly robust- better than most smaller still cameras . this camcorder truly opens up possibility leaving still camera home . - dv tape cost-effective convenience . i popped standard sony premium dv tape everything fine . so far , i've not seen any evidence frame dropping after 1 hour hd videotaping . everything smooth very eye-pleasing . i carefully considered other alternatives hdd dvd burners , but overall ease-of-use , dv proven cost-effective way take lot videos store them conveniently . - sony offers case underwater video ( sony camcorder marine case ( spk-hcb )) . this case which listed accessory offers good value considering custom camcorder cases run excess $1k . i bought one custom-adapt mounting plate because hole pattern not quite right . i used it while it snowing beach it worked very well ( case its own stereo microphone ) . i'm planning use it very soon some snorkeling . such underwater home footage should very cool . case really protects camera elements . case surprisingly sophisticated . example , it uses mirror access camcorder display . it turns out once connected properly , image lcd display backwards , so it seen correctly when looking reflected image mirror . well thought-out product indeed . cons -- it not most elegant or stylish hardware . - not neck strap . - audio not its strong point- nothing bad , but not particularly compelling . - i like use fader feature separate different tape segments , but accessing fade button through display touch-screen method takes too many strokes . once i start tape , it bothersome activate fader function during taping . - on-the-fly stills 16:9 widescreen so overall resolution printed paper not good stand-alone stills which standard 4:3 . - naturally , substantial investment camcorder unit , comes additional costs options such ( 1 ) stand-alone battery charger , ( 2 ) extra high-capacity battery , ( 3 ) better microphone , ( 4 ) external light source video stills . i already external mike ( sony ) double external light ( still video ) . i haven't used these enough yet provide proper review . this early camcorder review would not complete without mentioning significant value added using playstation 3 . camcorder video stored dv tape mpeg2 format . after recording , i simply transfer video into my ulead videostudio 10 plus which handles hdv files . after i copy mpeg2 file into hard drive ps3 using transportable hard drive . roughly speaking , one hour hd recording takes up 10 gb memory . one then watch hd video big screen using handy remote ($25 ) ps3 fast forward such so overall operation almost convenient if you burned bluray dvd . also , fact sxrd tv 3rd hdmi input front makes connecting camcorder particularly convenient . bottom line- camcorder very impressive . picture 60 " screen ranges very good eye-popping . colors very rich . i've primarily covered basic functions so far but there more learn explore this unit . coupling 1080p tv ps3 camcorder results most enjoyable hd experience .	1
i'm army i got this camera field camera . i taken it everywhere me since then it proved very durable camera well taking good quality pics video . i used it temps -30 120 it worked just fine when other cameras wouldn't . only reason i'm not giving it five stars because wifi feature only works every once while . other than this great camera	1
i read all these reviews cannot life me understand all crying whining wifi mode . i keep hearing how " complicated " " annoying " it , but this just plain wrong . i actually set my wifi up yesterday , you want know how long it took me ? minute . pop setup cd , click " wireless setup only " , plug your camera usb cable ( you need only this first time set up ! setup cd give you all directions , just follow ) , install it ( takes all few seconds ) , choose your connection mode , name , icon , you're . then unplug usb cable ( you now no longer need it ! ) , rotate click-wheel top camera wifi-mode , click " ok " voila ( you'll see wifi antenna flash blue ) . easy , it download all images your camera fast speed without any wires needed . how god name people making this out big deal ? read your manual you'll fine . i my homework literally months ended up choosing this model . i know cameras this easily best deal money . get familiar scene modes , they're absolutely phenomenal there something every shot angle . each scene mode choice 3 different effects , which really nice . variety shots you able take second none . 5 mp perfect compromise image quality , resolution , price . nikon always top-rate . photography something seems run family when my grandfather approved this camera , i knew it truly grea t.t he screen this thing amazing . 2.5 inches ! loss viewfinder something you won't even notice , lcd far more accurate tool anyway . erasing pictures simple , operating zoom piece cake , zoom nikkor lense one best market , ( schneiderkreuznach lenses kodaks carl zeiss lenses sonys ) . nothing against canon elph line because they're amazing , but lense nikon better i honestly feel canon models overpriced . ever picked up sd400 or 450 ? they feel far too tiny almost flimsy . sd500 550 bit better , but there virtually nothing grip . trust me , when you want really focus subject get perfect shot , last thing you want not firm enough grip your camera it slip . this also increases likelihood dropping it , which never good thing ! some complain red-eye reducer takes too long . flash go off three times red-eye-eliminator mode , so if you're taking picture your dog , turn it off , ( because subject moved then ) . people though , it fine . p2 comes great software it take all 5 seconds remove red-eye manually once uploaded if time before final flash goes off bothers you too much . i've heard whining p2 size ... why ? pick one up if you look one person . they're wondefully compact yet still heft them , very substantial hand grip doubles battery casing . it all metal beautifully designed , worksmanship speaks itself . nikon great choice , i also recommend olympus kodak ( kodaks king easy-to-use cameras ) . even full price this camera worth it ( 400 dollars ) , though you'll see it advertised 250-350 , which very fair prices . you're going love it , it very capable little machine take you gorgeous pictures . nothing off-limits there scene mode any situation . i no regrets . rechargable battery good save you money . i highlyyyy recommend you purchase lcd screen covers protect your very-large lcd screen . these bought ebay packs 3 10 dollars shipping	1
snaps high quality pictures super fast came batteries seem last forever ! what more could person want ? it even stores video snips effeciently . we've this camera several months , used it frequently , love it . my only warning don't let batteries run low ( ok , so they really don't last forever ! ) . we run into problems where we couldn't properly turn camera off when batteries low	1
camera excellent one , it took very high-quality pictures ; however , it broke little more than year after i bought it , it wouldn't power unknown reason , it exactly 14 days out one-year warranty ! repair cost rather expensive : $184 . i would rather buy new one than send it repair	1
i owned panasonic fz7 1 year excited purchase fz8 . there so many excellent qualities this camera offers . it very simple use beginner offers features suit professional . preview screen perfect size its bright vivid colors . settings easy change , including : shutter speed , aperture , time date , changing focus point , many other awesome features ! picture quality awesome , even 12x zoom , my prints not turn out grainy . nice light weight easy grip . now , dislikes .... only one . this camera not offer automatic pop-up flash . i remember open it . i cannot comment video this camera , i use sony handycam all my video needs . overall , i would highly recommend this camera even fz7 anyone interested starting out simple use camera	1
i lot hiking usually carry my dslr my backpack , which makes it awkward take out pictures . since getting this harness my camera always ready i take 20 times many shots out hike	1
haven't tried it windy conditions yet but i like it lightweight , easy transport extends 70 inches . extra height extension prevents you stooping over when shooting videos . good value , free shipping ( delivered 5 days hawaii - not bad ! ) amazon only makes it better ! highly recommended	1
this digital camera awesome . i no problem batteries . i made sure i put good batteries ( no cheap ones ) . i looked purchasing canon hp but features it this one outstanding price . i purchased this camera 1gb card it . i can't wait start using it when i go san diego march ..... awesome digital camera ...... you won't sorry this purchase ...	1
i purchased this my son he really likes everything camera . he loves quality pictures . he mention camera proprietary cable hooks his computer - just fyi	1
i needed battery my sony camera . amazon best price sony battery . however , my search revealed this combo which includes battery cheaper than battery alone . well , no-brainer ! it turns out , camera bag great item also . time , this outstanding deal	1
i've this scope 4 months now i very pleased it . firstly , i received it only three days amazon . secondly , i genuinely pleased all components made alloy or other metal , unlike particular meade unit , which i used lots plastic screws other parts . even tightening screws lens mounts red-dot sight metal this celestron . aluminum tripod quite sturdy adjustable ; good little guys girls star-gaze too . housing tube black aluminum sturdy well . red-dot sighter works well , especially when looking stars/planets high-power lens , less eye relief . magnification clarity views really good . i've seen rings saturn jupiter quite clearly this scope . i also purchased celestron eyepiece kit offers additional plossy lens ( varying power ) pretty good set filters ( including moon filter ) . only down side i think would lubricant used company rotating axis ' quite sticky if you get it ya . money , you're not going regret buy you'll probably glad you went this quality model over lesser ones , might even cost more . celestron good product this one . hope this helps some .	1
this my first experience this type battery , i quite pleased . i took it hawaii able shoot all day one battery	1
rechargeable batteries very good charger faster than manual says . it always faster than 3 hours it says	1
i such hard time choosing right hard drive camcorder ! according most comments web all hd camcorders poor quality , or software problems or something else . so i decide myself end i converged this one , which great pick , so easy use , incredible quality , so far no problems burning dvds ! slight compatibility problems existing burning software present my laptop sony software ... but once solved , i love it i love touchscreen ! i got whole package extra battery , but i still haven't used it ! battery lasts pretty long .	1
this great case protects my dscl1 very well . nice compact , not bulky all fits perfectly ! leather soft but it hard enough withstand impact . only reason i give it 4 stars instead 5 it doesn't pocket memory sticks	1
i bought last year model canon elph series because it cf card rather than sd card . when i needed extra battery , i found genuine canon battery , this kit cheaper than just battery alone . small leather case nice too , you get large handbag case free well . throw amazon super saver shiping , this deal can't beat . just make sure this right accessory kit your camera . it doesn't fit current models	1
local retail shops it $69.99 . so i saved $10 shipping . includes battery , leather case ( which strapped your belt ) , carrying case all accessories . only gripe us postal service . they're just inept . they attempted deliver business saturday ( when they weren't open ) couldn't redeliver till following friday . next time i'll pay few bucks extra get professionals ( ups , fedex , etc . ) deliver	1
dc-hc48 great camera very nicely sized easy use . i chose this version instead hc38 due support stills improved ccd . picture quality good light great . i actually displayed it my 60 inch tv picture good normal television . i very impressed picture . it also nice how easy it switch aspect rations either 16:9 ( wide-screen ) 4:3 ( standard ) . however it got darker outside light got lower inside i notice much " color " picture began fade picture became somewhat mono-tone . this seems common complaint cameras this price range low-light . i took camera into dark room ( i couldn't see thing ) i turned night mode very impressed . people things showed up great pitch black . ir light emitted camera picked up nicely acted like flashlight only camera would pick up . subject 5-10 feet away course image best center . effect very much like survivor night shots , or blair witch projec t.t he camera two modes operation . normal node , which allows you custom set settings like set focus , exposure , white balance , or effects like old film etc or set settings auto . easy mode , which lets you basically turn beeping off leaves all settings set auto . issue i found easy mode still pictures not work . also you stop recording switch easy normal mode . still photos fine quality considering its 1 mega-pixel camera . i wouldn't recommend using this your primary still photo camera though its nice option . touch screen i found somewhat cumbersome since you scroll through looking choices you want . so if you want make setting change quickly if you unfamiliar camera it might take while find . i also tend shake camera some when i use touchscreen . nice feature you create your own custom activity list so settings you set frequently more accessible then those you don't use . where i most disappointed accessories . standard battery it ships lasts 1.5 hours , which seems like reasonable time considering minidv tape only holds 60-90 minutes depending your setting . but like all batteries 1.5 ideal conditions not real world turning camera off playing features zooming out etc . additionally battery takes 1 hour 40 minutes charge which surprising . unfortunately battery not newer actiforce batteries which charge approximately 20 minutes ( actiforce charger ) . also take still photos you'll need buy separate memory stick duo card . ( not memory stick , memory stick duo smaller form factor ) . usb cable ships camera lets you get still photos camera ( attached dock ) onto your computer . however it not let you get video . instead you need fire-wire cable which not included . sony sells this cable around $40 . belkin makes cable around $12 . fire-wire ( i . link ) cable only allows you download video onto your computer ( not still photos ) . again you must attached docking station . if your traveling wish download computer you'll need bring docking station you ( it pretty small but my hassle bring you ) . docking station one way charge camera or you connect it wall supplied cables . unfortunately there only one power cable dock camera so if you plan just bring power cable you'll disconnect it docking station . short camera great just aware you might buying some more cables , batteries , chargers , memory sticks or other accessories end up affecting your total price ownership . sony brand name versions these accessories surprisingly pricey	1
recommendation photographer friend , i bought this kodak c875 camera . i wanted smaller , easy-to-use camera printer would produce high-quality , permanent photos or without my computer . moment , i'm using it without my computer , so i can't comment software , ubs connection , etc . this produces terrific , durable , quality photos , camera system easy use , once you figure them out . most electronics , instructions minimal not very well written . troubleshooting , online or not , annoying unhelpful . i'm moderately electronic/computer literate , although definitely not technogeek . but i fix basic stuff my computer , security systems programs online help -- i should proficient enough benefit kodak online info . instead , after fishing around not getting what i needed , i relied trial error . ( kodak , you listening ? )like reviewer , i've trouble paper feed . first time i tried use it , printer kept signaling there no paper tray , regardless how much or how little paper i put . i almost sent it back based problem , but kept it , hoping it one-time thing . problem resolved somewhat , but paper still doesn't always feed properly , sometimes needs bit push into feeder . even so , i'm impressed overall quality ease use , especially such reasonable price . cartridges easy handle , printer/paper cost less than photo-developing service , especially since you only print what you want . it so small , it invites you take it parties , family gatherings , etc ., it hard beat instant gratification nice photos send home guests . plus , it just looks cool when it printing -- very entertaining anyone who hasn't seen it before . if i could , i'd give it three half stars based quality prints , ease use portability . kodak great concept , but still some work . but i'd give them benefit doubt , buy this printer/camera again	1
i purchased kodak camera printer dock 4 years ago our daughter family . i impressed ease use both . i sony camera printer when camera needed work i decided go new kodakz650 . i love camera it so easy use . all grandkids take photos it dock plus . just snap camera it loads your computer or print out any photo you want . i think this good setup easy use . tooty hallber	1
sony alpha a100k best camera i ever owned . images nothing short spectacular . lens mount allows you use telephoto lenses other camera . i expensive telephoto lens my old 35mm minolta it fit this sony digital perfectly . you notice lot minolta features this sony since minolta left camera business . image stabilization feature makes it real hard mess up shot . if you beginner or pro , this camera easy use perfect pictures every time	1

this great camera wedding videographer or other serious amateur or semi-professional . it well built , great manual control , takes super video including good low-light performance . you probably want external mic attachment , which lets you use professional microphones without additional adapters signal processors . now price well below $2000 , it great deal . one caveat : if you plan shoot 16:9 format , this not best choice . panasonic gs400 handles much better , lower price . ( but gs400 doesn't low-light chops dvc-30 - so you set your priorities . ) plusses : * very good low light capability * sturdy , metal body construction * take professional external microphones ( optional attachment )* unbelievable bw no-light capability infrared ( short range built into camera ; medium range add-on ir light increases range hundreds feet . )* excellent manual control available via menu you put your favorite four settings programmable buttons camera body extra convenience . * without attachments , body built-in mic small consumer-like ( won't draw attention itself ) , not mention light-weight . * lovely video three 1/4-inch ccd . minuses : * sony 2100 even better low-light ability * 16:9 mode isn't good pdx10 or gs400 . * still picture capability only adequate . * built-in mic only average	1
this great machine , simply put , takes superb pictures . i experience using great number point shoot cameras this definitely best . features give great control over what you shoot if you so inclined use them know bit more photography . but if not you just use auto mode take unbelievable pictures . pictures i take this camera often look better than ones i take my 8mp canon rebel . video also great quality compared any other point shoot cameras . price , this camera spectacular ! if you even considering buying it then please make purchase , you won't let down	1
fuji f10 outstanding camera small problem : when shooting brilliant sun light trying frame picture , screen sometimes hard see .	1
while i am still learning how use all " bells whistles " , i think this camera awesome ! i suppress flash , force flash , reduce red-eye , take pictures low light .. best all , lcd display so large i review pictures immediately really see them . all my friends family comment size screen . recent family gathering , everyone wanted review pictures immediately rather than wait me get home e-mail them ! my nephew camera tiny screen no one asking see his pictures because you would need magnifying glass see anything !	1
only negative these binoculars they come really cheesy plastic strap , which i promptly threw away . otherwise they function fine bargain binocular	1
this got best camera money you buy right now !! i looking affordable camera , small thin , well-known name brand , takes sharp digital photos , shoot low light , uses cheap sd cards , good-sized lcd display , take decent videos . well , this casio exilim everything more , great price . i used it so much during my out-of-state travels without running out power or memory ( i bought 2gb sd card $20 [ ... ] i take more 1000 hi-res photos or hour video ) . i absolutely surprised how good videos i shoot this small digital camera , now i decided not buy new video camcorder , this casio exilim all i would need any occasion . if you're market great camera , look no further than casio exilim	1
i own nikon coolpix 3100 camera no complaints it , except fact its size ( even though it fairly small ) pain carry around when you want take pictures . looking much thinner camera , i came across this one quite pleasantly surprised its size , its ability take really great shots ! i'm merely birthday - holiday type picture taker , but this camera definitely enable me take more pictures , because i'll carrying it around my pockety whennever i go somewhere might provide photo opportunity .	1

i've seen some bad digital frames- ones stretch out picture , making everyone look fat , or dim displays bad color . philips frame absolutely opposite : it delightfully easy use picture quality great . pictures automatically sized , cropped , even rotated when you turn frame . i didn't need software they included . i just dumped pile pictures cf card ( using my camera wired computer ) then plugged card into frame . menus frame navigated little joystick back . it not nicest menu system , but i got hang it pretty quickly . if you buying this grandma ( course ) here tip : buy two memory cards so you switch photo albums when you visit	1
philips 8-inch digital picture frame excellent , high-quality device . very easy get it going - included cable computer software make it simple select digital pictures already stored your computer copy them onto device . no need mess around memory cards - although device accepts those well if works best you . everyone who seen ours loves it . it looks great picture quality size excellent	1

this camera awsome cause you store music it take pictures too , one only stupid things ... it doesn't work tripod so , i suggest you don't buy tripod if you buy this camera	1
purchased this unit new $160 . good performance - little practice , getting readings well over 800 yards , even bright sunlight . also like fact it uses standard aaa cells . housing design leaves bit desired - it bulky , battery cover not very secure . see losing cover easily . not ergonomic more recent models . overall , $160 rangefinder genuine 800 yard performance , good deal	1
i havent gotten these before but they look like good pair binoculars . i suggest adding these your wish list if you like outdoors	1
i'm very satisfied this product , enhance highly pictures sharpness low light conditions , i've olympus sp-350 , takes pics like professional camera this flash !, i highly suggest this product everyone desire better pics low light condition ! this flash reach more than 30mts long	1
flash works great . i'm thankful it auto programmed works off cameras settings making picture taking quite easy	1
i recently went new york found it quiet amazing watch things empire state building . it not adjustability but than mentioned product description . price it goes it definitely very good product	1
this digital camera best . i cannot complain any aspect it . it huge amount modes settings additional features add pictures you taking them . it small enough fit into your pocket not think it ( it smaller than wallet ) . it takes excellent pictures come out looking great , all very high quality . huge screen makes it easy view what you looking great image quality . videos equally good , great sound good picture . it looks better than just any other digital camera i seen . even though i said i cannot complain , there few things slightly annoy me occasionally . first it flashes twice . remember tell this people before taking their picture ! after first flash , people tend look away , time second flash comes picture taken , moment lost . this only occurs when camera set " auto " mode . i usually press menu button choose mode . when you this , flashes occur very quickly ( you barely notice gap them ) . some features very useful . i use " backlight " mode quite often . it allows you take picture something even if there bright light background . my only other complaint those us large fingers , circular button operates pretty much every feature difficult use ( sometimes i push 2 buttons once , or complete wrong one ) . but everything else this camera cancels it out . this camera more features better quality than many larger more expensive cameras out there	1
this 3rd digital camera i use , it really impressive . here highlights : -first off i loved video feature , you get decent 640x480 sound , since camera so small , you'll always able capture those special moments , it also comes usb cable connect pc cable connect camera t.v ( video audio out)-the rechargable lion battery also comes charger very nice feature , digital cameras notrious battery drainers , i separate budget batteries ( aa ) my former camera , those aint cheap ! - so you wont worry this this one . -it also voice recorder so you record notes when you taking still photos . negative sides : - you need buy separate sd memory because high resolution stills videos take lot memory , you'll need least 512mb , better yet go 1gb . -the special effects button back camera kinda useless , it turn pictures into monochrome , b/w . sepia etc . or negative , _ biggest negative thing i found it takes way too long actually capture picture even low res . flash goes twice red eye reduction ( very impressive results ) but whole process slooow , so you end up not taking shot you intended , i am still trying figure out how disable this feature so it takes photos faster . this may only real negative feature this camera .	1
i decided i wanted this while before i got it . i read reveiws i realized majority them postive . there nothing wrong it , microphone works really good but you not watch your videos sound camera . it take around 300 some pictures 60 minutes video super sine mode , where it uses most megapixels . it definetly something i would recommend anyone	1
i purchased 9 yr old it great camera . takes excellent qulaity . battery life good . my cannon nikon really no better . she takes pictures everything never flaw . seems very sturdy camera built very well . i bought becasue samsung name . i purchased many samsung products before very happy them . i've used theri customer service other products i've found them quick respnse helpful . i would recommend this camera any age child or adult . +++ only thnig i don't like lens not cover when off . i not experienced any problems but i am keeping eye out just case . i still recommend this quality camera	1
hi .... i purchased this camera my daughter after looking several " person " best buy then looking far wide net . this camera her choice she loved using it . so , while , i've not used it myself i safely say this good purchase good price . also black case makes it quite " hip " or least i'm told since 65 my " hipness " days maybe behind me ! lt ;	1
this must nikon cameras , battery don't last much instead change them all time , i just plug it still shots or photo shoots click away	1
this little beauty really everything it claims . there so many shooting formats you spoilt choice . only problem i there so many formats it take me lot practice able pull fast point shoot anything other than normal light . i tend better less choices but many people undoubtedly love it . however , internal guide very helpful -- it choose format you need if you few moments consult it . its size perfect body feels good your hand . huge viewscreen size . 1 gig card extra battery , i'm set travel	1
it what it but works easy carry compact tripod , comes hand	1
you amazed see difference clarity photo shot without tripod tripod . tripod must . this cute little tripod sony makes job easier carry it around your camera . i gave it 4 star because sometimes tripod not able hold weight camera tends fall . i sony dsc-p200 camera which very light-weight . this tripod not able hold weight such light camera . you can't use it your heavier cameras or camcorders ..	1
picture quality good , but when you take flash off you hold still take picture or it blur . if you flash you moving or car taking picture it not blur . overall i really like this camera wide viewing screen awesom	1
this 5th digital camera i owned i think none compared quality vs price this one . i little frightened some reviews but after getting this camera i taken 200 pics last 4-5 days ( learning how use different settings ) i am really pleased i ordered it . all new products you buy you learn how they work . more options , more learn . i impressed movie quality also most cameras not great quality . i converted quicktime wma dvd they looked great big screen tv . only little drawback i see door card i am very careful when opening . i always carried couple spare batteries if you buy charger keep them charged there no problem . this i think true all battery based items lot use . i also keep 3-4 extra cards storage . you don't depend flashlights not keep extra batteries or blame flashlight when it quits	1
this great camera ! finally someone made camera takes whole field view , not just small portion it . also image quality excellent . i took some pictures low lighted restaurant without flash they came out extremely well . normal lighting conditions pictures sharp color excellent . screen menu also very intuitive easy use . down side , there few minor issues . first , it rather annoying focal length jumps 23mm all way 39mm then zooms up there . i would preferred second lense began 32mm or 34mm rather than 39mm so more mid-range available . second , battery rather small . i would preferred battery larger so it would last longer . i haven't issue battery running out me , but i know it would last longer if it bigger . third , ( this issue all pocket cameras , not just v705 ) , i wish someone would make camera case belt clip well battery pocket . i haven't able find anywhere any my pocket cameras . all all , this great camera . i also own canon sd300 ( which also great camera ) but i find i take v705 me most time because beautiful wide angle shots it takes .	1
quality good , but case so much padding inside it could not hold my z740 . padding removal tho so i got it fit . it lost star becase advertised dimensions case without padding or external dimensions which not useful	1
addition review above - version passes distance data body flash use , not . also , version metal bayonet mount , plastic . build both very light " plasticy " . i used " " version d2h d2x surprisingly good results considering cost . may still better value , but least consider these differences addition those mentioned other review .	1
this camera fantastic ! when i compare printed photos this camera other 5mp cameras , i find quality superior . battery lasted week bahamas no recharge several hundred pictures taken ( just follow directions use proper batteries !! ) printer dock easy use prints very nice quality pictures fairly quickly . cost $0.30 per print , but great deal if your looking high quality prints immediately ! i think this camera great !!	1
i looking good set " cheap " binos astronomical use . most reports suggest not going over 10x magnification order ensure stability while hand-holding binos , but there enough reports these usable while held i went them . my money , these absolutely amazing . while it true outer 25% ( give or take ) field view soft blurry , field view itself so large this little impact . optics multi-coated , honestly , coatings leave bit desired , while my daylight testing made me wonder whether or not these would passable binos stargzing , first light night sky blew me away . light gathering power 70mm objectives sufficient bring milky way new life even my light polluted suburban skies , m42 wonder behold , i actually found , even only 1/4 visible , moon so bright i couldn't look it extended periods . hand-holding these binos not problem . they're lighter than i expected , i actually easier time hand-holding these than i other , much lower power binos . all-around pair binos stargazing , these things get my vote " best value . " i haven't them long enough talk longevity may ultimatley influence my opinion , but under $100 , it hard go wrong these	1
like so many before me , i've experienced white-screen problem dsc-s40 well ... fortunately , it happened after 10 months use , so i able make use warranty . i my parents send it , they few issues frustrations getting it sent back them , but it worked fine afterward . until now , . yesterday , out seemingly nowhere , screen started act strangely . i usually take black white pictures ... while white portions would remain somewhat intact , black areas replaced various ugly shades blue there streaks all over image . when i uploaded pictures my computer , they turned out fine , but now i'm scared screen die me again . little tap logo enough fix it now ( i give thanks whoever put suggestion out there ) , but these problems shouldn't even exist , especially after not even 15 months use . much i may like camera its ease use quality its pictures , although it served me well through over 15,000 shots , i'd advise people stay away it ... it more trouble than it really worth long run	1
only used charger batteries couple months but say charger works quickly . it charges 4 batteries 2 hours or so . charger compact light . batteries last long time -- 500 shots or more -- cannon 2s camera . i haven't made any comparison similar chargers or batteries	1
i actual bought this my 15 year old niece , got it just over $100 @ circuit city . i gotta say so far i'm impressed , it take great pictures , zoom before/after picture taking , audio/video capability well web cam . now i canon powershot a75 , which i love , more ability then this camera , but price if your new digital i would recommend	1
recently , i moved sony dsc 707 sony 100 dslr . change cameras cybershot dslr took some getting used . i purchased sony 75-300mm telephoto lens amazon soon it arrived i attached lens began use it . i am definitely pleased lens , price it capabilities . used slr almost 30 years , moving dslr takes some time patience . sony 100 solid perfomer , it my fourth sony digital camera . avid photographer , sony 75-300mm telephoto lens priced well provide exceptional performance . once you attach lens you discover when maximum telephoto mode , lens quite long . if you attach lens shade it even longer takes some handling considerations tight spaces . extreme focusing speeds 100 rapid vary it adjusts optimim focus . lens auto mode constant adjustment . this focus issue takes some getting used . lens balances quite nicely th 100 . most photographers , you need find best hand positions camera body lens so you feel comfortable while you shoot . lens ultra depth field sensitive . lens camera now month , i am beginning adjust its " sometimes hyper adjustment activity " ! i am no way disappointed lens because telephoto shots i kept recorded first rate sony 100 sony 75-300mm lens . all new cameras , it takes time become familiar camera settings lens activity . i highly recommend lens awarness it sensitivity length . after hours shooting i am pleased lens , sony attention detail both lens construction performance . if you own sony 100 dslr , or plan invest sony dslr system , this lens not let you down . you review your photos pleased results sony lens provides you . i intend invest other sony lens future . now , two sony lenses fulfill my photographic needs quite nicely . sony entered dslr market outstanding camera quality accessories .	1
i really like this camera . it 10x optical , image stabilization , 3.0 inch lcd 230,000 pixels , more . size great 10x zoom camera . image stabilization great getting shots would come out blurry my canon powershot a620 . my other favorite feature besides zoom image stabilization , wide angle . it great finally get cityscapes whole skyline one shot !! camera set 16x9 , i get 24mm shot ! what i don't like this camera it short battery life . even the1300mah battery i bought , i get less shots than my canon . colors photos this camera lot less colorful than canon . something i get used . i very disappointed find out this camera no zoom movie mode , unlike its predecessor , tz1 . luckily , not stop me buying this camera . overall , this camera great buy , especially if you want i.s. wide angle , long zoom	1
i went ritz camera today took good look tz3 . i'll tell you , its pretty nice . build quality really good , previous person mentioned . body metal . dials buttons click precision , nice resistance . it nice weight it . i took some nice shots store . i must clicked off 100 pics . i'm impressed it . if you want something relatively small , powerful tough , this camera you . 10x zoom great , but such small camera it difficult hold it steady enough(at least me ) use zoom too much . i love build quality style , so i may biased . it nice piece equipment . i cannot speak photo quality only seen pics camera lcd	1
i owned first generation dmc-tz1 . dmc-tz3 some welcome improvements ; wider angle , automatic lens cover , maybe 25% faster sho t-t o-shot . particular , wider angle really useful feature . camera strength its versatile , outdoor shooting . it best lots light . indoors , flash coverage just ok . sho t-t o-shot flash recycle time sometimes pokey 4 seconds . digital picture noise noticeable lesser light . setup tips : 1 . use 3x2 ratio if you primarily print 6x4 photos . 2 . use vivid mode normal mode looks washed out .	1
you would expect sony this case extremely well made design excellent . all controls still readily available easily operated when camera case . if anything , camera easier use when it case due its small size otherwise . i bought this case mainly make my t7 look like cheap plastic camera so i am more comfortable wearing it around my neck when i'm wandering around places where small expensive-looking camera might attract unwanted attention	1
sports pack case exceeded my expectations , which originally fair already ! because case designed especially dsc-t7 , it fits perfectly : once case , compact camera becomes far more accessible . it easier hold handle , case not make it any harder use any buttons . case very sleek design many people already complimented it . some people even likened it looking like psp ! i am very satisfied this purchase because it , i enjoy all functions camera without constantly worrying dropping or scratching it . i strongly recommend buying this case your dsc-t7 . beginning , i some reservations spending $90 camera case , but it really fantastic	1
camera exactly what i wanted . size great quality very good	1
while i agree others this camera takes some pretty nice pictures easy use , i've same problems many noted here . starters , thing eats through batteries like there no tomorrow . i lucky get 20 pictures before batteries crapped out . my biggest problem , however came when my son handing camera over me dinner table it slipped out his hand . camera literally fell only 10-12 inches table , but enough render this camera permanently inoperable . warned : if you little bit clumsy or butter-fingers , think twice before buying this camera ! red-eye reduction also bit joke this one	1
hp photosmart m417 5mp excellent camera it price ! only thing i recommend buy couple rechargeable batteries because any other digital cameras ... you need them	1
those card readers previous reviewer talking break after too much data transfered so not listen him . canon makes quality products their cables same i never problem them . you don't worry losing cables if they stay conneected your computer . if you don't enough room purchase usb hub	1
my first digital camera sony cybershot , i it 3 years until last december it fell into swimming pool , amazingly it still turned you could still view pictures just not take new ones . i impressed always impressed sony . so when it time new camera i picked sony cybershot dsc 9 . sony , it again ! this camera spectacular ! i purchased it december last year use it consistent basis every weekend . fantastic detail color photos , very high quality . incredibly powerful flash , my photos always look beautiful . camera sharp , sleek , modern looking . fits nicely into pocket or small purse . my opinion it one best digital camera out there right now . i love sony !	1
it excellent dvd camcorder but some problems execution edition software keep archives little traditional formats . general it excellent option purchase	1
i lot research camcorders before i decided purchase canon dc-40 . it everything i expected more . video audio quality far superior our old videotape camcorder . dc-40 gives me all tools i need get best picture sound under any condition i am shooting under . get same number pixels dc-40 offers , you might pay twice much . i am amazed how good video i get camera i carry my coat pocket	1
this machine you waiting . it so easy use . it almost anything you imagine terms still photography . it if you best digital compact camera . quality dvd movies amazing . it like looking through window when you watch your video tv . it close high defonition i ever seen . it worth while read instruction manual first , there few little things correct sequnece finalise dvd , but it very simple . sound crips clear out any noise interuptions . i would say this best dvd camcorder available moment	1
i carried this all over hawaii my backpack get those lava shots waterfalls . lightweight easy use	1
i'm not professional photographer or videographer . i just wanted this product videotape my new baby other family events my digital camcorder . tripod easy set up use . panning camera around fairly smooth easy . overall , price , i don't think this product beaten	1
this item works like it supposed . place battery charger , plug charger wall , charges battery . this can't any more simpler . good product . ( also power dcr cameras , but why ? )	1
product arrived timely manner . i not used it yet , i still need time learn how use my new photo printer . kodak name reputation got photo printer purchased first place	1
so far i like everything this camcorder . i admit , i haven't alot time any video editing computer . still pics seem look good easy download my existing kodak software . i downloaded couple clips my pc . editing software comes camcorder sucks though . camera light compact . it alot easier just carrying one camera video take pics . price high compared one model below this one . i wish i knew how good quality other model , but i thought extra zoom mp digital would worth extra expense . overall , i am satisfied	1
we purchased this camcorder our son because he enjoys movie making . this product offers excellent picture quality . video editing software comes camcorder easy use . i would recommend this product	1
great item , quality fit up nikion standards	1
camera really easy use any setting . flash great even really dark rooms . pictures crisp clear . very user friendly . still getting used 4 second delay take next picture . i know there setting it some where but not figured it out yet . otherwise great camera everyday use those us who not professional photographers trade	1
this not fitted case 8800 i expected , but also makes it usable cameras ( or what not ) size . nice quality product	1
there enough room outside pocket , mesh pocket inside top cover , memory cards , extra battery , even usb cable . set two belt loops would feel more secure than single centered belt loop provided . i still want larger belt pack ( or small backpack ) accommodate camera , accessories , other supplies all day outing	1
excellent value money . its genuine canon product half cost . fantastic deal . worth every penny . highly recommend	1
i bought two after-market batteries $12/ea . what waste ! after charging them completely camera displayed low battery warning . don't waste your money cheapo aftermarket batteries don't work . canon batteries worth extra money	1
very impressed picture colour , even low light much less granularity than other cameras we looked . there aren't too many bells whistles , but basic camcorder , you can't beat quality	1
1 . i ordered this very close christmas . data said there would three five business day delay . binoculars mailed out next day . i recieved notice mailing they arrived time christmas . i am very impressed . 2 . they shipped carefully arrived good shape	1
i bought few binoculars past couple years . satisfied only couple . these binoculars i am very pleased . clarity very good price terrific . i wasted alot money some not so good bushnell binoculars . but this pair pleasant surprise	1
i bought this because i directv wired one side my room wanted tv other side room . i could paid someone run cable up exterior insulated wall , through attic down other wall but this just plain easier . plus , i occasionally like watch game my garage while working so i plan try it my small tv . i no problems interference but it 15 feet line-of-sight i no 2.4 ghz wireless networks or phones nearest neighbor 70 feet away . when i try broadcasting garage , i update this review performance . setup trivial . it would nice able buy additional matching receivers because i would like broadcast directv commercial free radio my stereo floor . one more thing , website says this sylvania but box labeled quot ; lorexquot ; . not big deal since most electronics rebranded anyway	1
excellent product accessories . i am very happy this able find it amazon . i looked several other places could not find what i needed . thanks amazon !	1
dock very easy use connecting camera your television or computer or printer uploading your pictures . just important , since battery came docking station defective , it showed me hp customer service indeed stand behind their product . i new battery within days contacting customer service	1
this perfect case travelling , it very good , fuctional practical . it small enough travel large enough fit everything related your cammera ( cables , batteries , etc )	1
if you're looking something protect your camera getting scratched that all , then this great product . i throw my camera my purse , so i wanted something keep it getting banged up . there old review here 2004 says it like leather glove . it true , leather very soft , but it not completely soft-sided . there isn't any padding it light weight , but it slightly reinforced holds it shape when it empty . if you drop your camera high level , no , this probably not protect it breaking . but if you accidentally knock it table , this should keep it safe . there not storage , fyi . it one hole top wrist band stick through it leather loop back so you wear it your belt if you like . i think price if your purpose simple everyday wear tear protection , then this good product . if you're rough your camera , don't get this ; find something padded	1
i purchased least ten these cases i helped friends get these fine canon s500 sd550 cameras . only thing i wish canon would put pocket side extra camera battery which you should absolutely all times . this case my favorite it protects this fine little camera not intended carry half your belongings like ladies sometimes their pocketbooks ! this still best choice give your camera protection worn your belt very comfortably .	1
this case very well constructed designed . it made very soft leather lined nylon type material soft fleece or micro suede . it three pockets inside varying sizes hold sd cards and/or batteries . cases fits snuggly closes full width velcro closure . easy open close without looking . there belt loop back fit 1.25 " wide belts . i love soft leather but after month use , some wear showing corners . i buy one when this one wears out ! amazon shows this unavailable , i bought mine april 1 , 2006 local camera store $24.95 . although designed nikons , i use it my canon sd600 . it much nicer than small canon case which hard pack style case chrome snap . nikon camera easily pocketable while using camera	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet .	1
haven't used it lot ... but so far ... easy use ... works low light ... decent sound ... great video ..	1
i decided since i no expertise cameras , i needed one my new job , i would go factory refurbished one . so far this camera everything i could possibly want . good battery life nimh rechargeable batteries , great clear pix , easy use . lcd came some minor scratches , but i guess refurb thats expected . i like this camera also because it viewfinder which lot new cameras not . i would recommend this camera anyone who looking easy use well made , inexpensive camera work	1
my nephew thrilled recieve this graduation . he took it his trip spain got great pictures . good camera price	1
i camera 2 years all all it exceptional camera its many advanced features . designers must felt because wide range f-stops , very slow/fast shutter ( 3sec 1/2000 ) fantastic film speed range ( auto or iso 80 800 ) , why large flash . e550 designed available light camera . true flash only works when autofocus autorange feature work . it must see something well or you get no flash . somethings i like unlimited movie time . ( card limited ) almost none existant shutter delay very unusual digital camera . while driving i pick up camera , turn it shoot one hand shot deer side highway . i just preset it speed prioity shutter , preset 1/800 or 1/1000 . dial top you set priority amperture , speed manual or program all . i also like feature automatic exposure bracketing . also rapid shooting feature get object moving . also i like feature prefocus ( pressing shutter half way down)then waiting instant shot . what worked alaska get whale which only instant surface . it very capable camera well ' point shot ' . i taken 3000 photos it . it great camera but if not set correctly you may not get good picture	1
large sharp photos amd mp3 player cool too	1
this digital photo frame reasonably good picture quality once set up , used anyone selected mode . i it set slide presentation mode people enjoy looking it . i could easily see giving it , already set up , people who not computer savvy , such grandparents . give them new pictures , send new card they slip . said , cost still fairly high buttons top frame useless unless you them memorized or really good vision . i would recommend this product	1
i purchased this camera 6 months ago . so far so good . this my 4th digital camera 5 years ( i take 20-200 photos week ) . i started canon digital elph 2mp . right before my year warranty up , door compact flash card broke off zoom sticking times - but they couldn't duplicate stick so they just fixed door . 6 months later zoom wore out . i drop it several times , someone bumped into me beer it got little wet . besides sticky zoom , camera still works but i need more megapixels . then i bought 4 mp elph it lasted 2 1/2 years before button broke ( switch viewing photos taking photos ) . then friend talked me into casio because longer battery life , big screen he showed me great photos he took his . so i switched casio - big mistake . i enjoyed long batter life big screen but flash week lot photos i took dark dance clubs horrid . casio lasted 6 months before zoom got stuck when i bumped it - not covered warranty . i switched back canon but i wanted something more control , more manual functions . so canon s80 seemed like best match . it little bigger than what i'm use but quality photos makes up it . video amazing - it great you take small videos , easy enough email - or high quality video - better than any camcorder i've owned . definetly get 1 gig card , especially if you want use high quality video . so far camera pretty solid - no problems all i think bigger size easier hold onto . my only complaint dial switch modes moves too easily . if i camera setting i need night , i'll camera , waiting right moment take photo . while i'm holding camera , i accidently touch wheel my thumb change my setting without knowing it . then when i go take photo , i miss perfect moment because setting wrong . that my only complaint - if it wasn't i'd give this camera 5 stars	1
tried it indoor outdoor .. it works fine .. dual voltage charger added advantage too .. works great good starter camcorder .	1
this camcorder great little camera easy operate . lcd clear colors crisp . needed buttons easy access . it lightweight fits nicely palm your hand .	1
i got digital keychain my wife , so she could carry pictures our 3 grandchildren . i download mac software tao website load photos , but everything then went pretty smoothly . my wife really likes resul t.t he hardware gets 5 stars - it works advertised , photos look pretty good very small screen . software gets 3 1/2 stars . it crashed once , but since then it stable . it good job letting me crop pictures ( which important , since only closeups useful small lcd screen ) . it took some trial error find out best way use software : 1 . select each desired photo , edit it add " collection " . 2 . transfer collection keycain . 3 . save collection file . 4 . when you later want add more photos , not open old collection . just start aother collection add new photos . then transfer additional photos keychain . if you add photos original collection , then transfer , you wll end up two copies your original photos keychain	1
great gift idea . easy download pictures use afterwards . just use close up shots able view them easier	1

this item received promptly well packaged . item works fine quality item . excellent service	1
i bought this well other lenmar batteries . i own lenmar equivalent sony camcorder battery , two other different canon camera equivalents , now i'm getting nb-4l nb-5l well lenmar . i don't doubt lenmar . batteries i bought three years ago still performing flawlessly , while canon caught up them capacity ( yes , lenmar batteries used more capacity than canon branded ones ) they still high quality charging cameras ' oem chargers without any problems . they cost third half cost canon sony branded equivalents . lenmar i got my s400 digital elph actually outlasted canon battery , though i used them alternately lenmar more mah than canon . i've more quality warranty issues ( though resolved ) canon than i've lenmar , so me lenmar deserves all five stars	1
just bought this my sony hdr-hc1 , battery big , but it balances camera better than standard battery . i think sony designed camera little heavy front make this battery balance camera so well . price seems steep but it less than buying three standard batteries , it replaces . great buy my book ! buy two so you always one charged ready go . you run out tape before ypu run out battery	1

i've wanted purchase pair binoculars couple years , but kept putting it off because i figured i'd dump least $300 quality pair . i wanted something compact , good quality , affordable . not exactly easy order . but after reading reviews these bins , i figured i'd give them try . all i say wow . these exactly what i looking . they provide very crisp image lower magnification levels . even 24x , although usually impractical , they lot fun . i find it easy focus change zoom level one hand which plus . general purpose viewing , these fantastic binoculars . bins shipped black velcro-flap carrying case belt loop back , small carrying strap you attach your bins	1
i ordered these binoculars my husband birthday . they arrived promptly excellent condition ; well packed . we both surprised how powerful they easy use , wow ! very , very pleased . they very light weight ( nice these old arthritic arms hands ) . only possible drawback they not waterproof need kept dry all times , so dh not able take them fishing trips unless he double zipper lock bags them .	1
i really like case . its stylish well made . sort looks like prada . unfortunately panasonic doesn't anything like it . so i bought canon . it fits f07 maybe little snugly , but thats ok me . i like easy magnetic closure stylish red strap silver accent . panasonic please make stylish case like this one your products	1
since it leather , you put some pressure camera push it case it stretched perfectly 1-2 days allow sd700 fit still snap clasp . fits ' like glove ' which maintains beauty small camera yet still case .	1
this first electronic gadget i bought years i able figure out minutes ! out box , after 2 hour charge ( gave me chance watch tutorial scan manual ) i wasmaking movies ! i not used high quality setting yet but mid-range pretty darn good ! most impressive feature its " anti jitter " filtering . any other camcorder i ever tried makes mymovies look like i am middle earthquake ! not this one ! ( unless you max zoom ) theoptical zoom far more than needed so i never expect even use digital zoom . there " easy " mode automatically sets camera adequate settings . it actually works . only thing i am problems getting camera connect pc . camera says " connecting " just hangs . i call sony report back . i suspect better editingsoftware cure . software provided very basic . workaround now just insert dvd directly into pc then use software read edit it . it would nice if you could " finalize " dvd pc rather than camcorder . initialy , i purchased camcorder alone see how i like it but i just ordered all options	1
i love this camcorder . it simple use i love fact you just hit one buttom it formats disc then it ready go into your dvd player . it all right features , but not so many you'll never use them all . i love clear , precise focus night shot option filming indoors outdoors . i've this product 3 months now , i've completed one disc i'm very satisfied it performance	1
i am no way computer geek , i no idea what optical zoom finalizing disc meant . but i am mom wanted quality home videos my girls wanted spend less than $450 . so here my opinion . i returned my samsung 164 this camera . it same price but this super niteshot . camera very light easy control one hand . lens made glass versus samsung which made plastic . zoom amazing this camera , i stood across my kitchen able zoom small print my calendar , amazing ! i am so glad i took samsung 164 back - indoor quality camera horrible . this excellent even low light situations . very pleased . i also able record dvd -r which not require formatting - just put disc record . oh finalizing just when you recording you go menu camcorder press finalize it 1 minute it says it complete your . not complicated i thought it would	1
i purchased aiptek mpvr use twenty20 helmet cam while riding motorcycles offroad . it serves purpose very well . video quality dependent helmet cam , mpvr only acting recording device . unit light , compact not subject mechanical failures occur tape or disk based recorders . since it records sd memory cards , it easy delete files free up space there no need cables transfer files computer . it uses standard nokia 8210 batteries , which last 1 hour recording . 1 gigabyte sd card holds 45 minutes video . you also use mpvr camcorder or camera , although it somewhat limited because its fixed focus lack zoom . price , i feel it great product	1
rocks !!! i used it take video our band dark basement , it it worked great . i wanted cheap video camera i could thrash around little bit , this one went above beyond . features it great , battery lasts , all you need , least 512mb sd card . only thing i found needs work nightshot . if your video taping some thing thats moving(a band normally moves quite bit ) it makes everything fuzzy , really ruin video . this great video camera , i would buy it if it costs twice much	1
i've using this carrier carry around my sony cybershot camera . it fits perfectly it ( snug .... no wiggling ) . camera i'm using sony dsc-t100 . i've very pleased it . i carry it my belt . only reason 4 stars out 5 catch flap holds camera . it magnetic holder sometimes pull loose ( putting seatbelt car , etc . ) . i think regular snap might little easier . but even small difficulty , it worked very well i'm well pleased it . it sturdy protect camera . i would recommend it anyone .	1

this not high-tech digital frame . it doesn't play mp3 . it doesn't come remote . it simply reads your digital pictures card displays them slide show mode . there " " button " off " button . there no manual read order learn how operate your frame ( though it come one-page instruction sheet ) . it great your office desk when all you need reach over turn it or off . if you want display it difficul t-t o-reach location , or choreograph your pictures music , then this not frame you	1

not lenmar brand but very good long lasting praction panasonic oem battery . very satisfie	1
i expecting get lenmar brand shown website but instead received accesory power brand , however , i satisfied battery . it rated 800mah vs 680mah panaonic battery . it fits my fz5 charger well oem battery it seems last longer	1
i like this lens . i use it landscape photography . i find images i take sharp , vr works nicely . telephoto lens , it bigger than my wide-angle lenses heavier ( 5 pounds ) . definitely workout when i am hiking	1
yes , without doubt this lens worth price . i not used it film but i couldn't happier how it performs my digital d200 . there reason pro use lenses manufacturer their cameras . same reason these lenses cost more ! quality , durability performance ! when you hook this lens up new camera technology performance quick responsive . yes , autofocus hunt times , usually you focus first time . it easy switch manual focus also slightly adjusted manually during exposure lock . images crisp colors superb ! personally i like weight substantial feel this lens . when extended full zoom balance not quite nice but certainly manageable me . i am over 6ft tall could see where someone smaller size would find this lens heavy . far i am concerned size weight they should quality lens this range . build quality very good ! controls right place quickly become intuitive . i disagree other complaints regards tripod collar . one came my camera fits tightly securely . it also removes very easily since it heavy weight reduction noticeable . this lens comes very rugged pouch strap well front rear caps lens shade . lens shade big ! suffice it say if you using lens shade this lens it looks like something sidelines nfl game . bottom line this my favorite lens ! i thought long hard getting 70-200mm afs 80-200afs nikkor lenses . not day goes i haven't glad i put my money towards this lens it much bigger zoom range . remember 1.5 factor when using digital sensor . good luck	1
what amazed me soon i opened box how small this camcorder size woman hand . it came complete tripod stand , carrying strap , carrying case , software cd , cables even batteries . software easy install all you need viewing editing your pictures or video . viewing area this camcorder small(like product itself ) but surprisingly easy view . it comes 4x zoom you see believe . there both manual auto focus camera well settings indoors , outdoors low light . cam comes built light remarkable job such small cam . pictures video great 1 gig card you all room you could possibly need . features this so numerous i not list them all . following instruction manual best way learn how use this cam properly . it comes both full manual quick use guide . trying " wing " it possible because this camera so easy use but you likely miss out many great functions available . everyone i shown this product amazed quality cam low price . this one great deal i suggest impossible pass up . many digital camera much more money only take clips not capture better pictures than this cam . summary i highly recommend this camcorder , you not go wrong it :	1

sony hvr-a1u cmos high definition camcorder 10x optical zoom performs advertised . it very versatile answer user various demands it . when high definition dvd recorders ( blu-ray or hd dvd ) become standardized widely available , i expect this technology norm . pictures hi-def wonderful	1

i market hd camera best price . i looked into canon hv-10 which priced 1000 dollars which hd quality . i compared this camera baseline . online i read panasonic pv-gs320 which upgraded model gs300 released early 2006 . this camera 3ccd , what mean ? each ccd processing chip allows image display it best . how you test this ? go your local best buy or compusa where they this camera . 1 ccd camera zoom 25-30x digital zoom . you start see blurry . same gx320 you see much clearer crisp image . you notice difference right away .	1
amazon updated info this case incorrectly . this acc-dvdp case dvd 203/403 mini dvd camcorders . i mean , this perfect case camera . camera fits into palm your hand case goes right around it space your batteries mini dvd . entire world tell this case made just your camcorder . --- note : don't buy it dvd 7 listed product info . they wrong camcorder listed . this mini dvd 203/403 camcorders !!	1
others mentioned , autofocus little slow sometimes won't focus all really low light . but you should manual focusing anyways . other than this great lense , especially less than 200 dollars . i've used it photographing motocross surfing so far . 300mm good getting close up surfers while standing beach . colors crisp this lense seems little sharper than 28-80mm nikkor came my d50	1
don't fooled what people say this item . they say things break using it or just fall off this product . so where i begin , well first off i could not more happy this product then i already am . i got this nice box opened it right away . first thing i noticed its size . it nice small thats way it should . however when i saw how small it compared what i originally thought , i worried video quality . then onced i recorded things different lighted areas , i found it great quaslity . one problem i found when it dark , this camera deos not so well dark . it just lowers quality video . so after trying it out i confused little how work it but i found out how use it right away . i bought 10 dollar 1g memory card it they work perfectly together . clip lens protector little unsatisfieing but it good short term . i not tried mp3 player because i not buy this camera , however i try voice recorder . everything works great pictures videos voice recorder . this camera also nice small features like changing formats things you record , all those little things . one-hundred dollars this must buy . this camera perfect if your looking compatibility , recording movies . believe it or not if you record 30 fps 1gb card you record one hour thirty minutes . pros : -price ( camcorder 100$ however buy 10$ gb card because not all cards go into this camera , believe me its worth money . card cheap works perfectly camera . )-quality ( good quality such small thing you chose different frame rates . )- 5.1 megapixels ( this good cameras , some expensive cameras might not even this . )-memory ( card this good amount memory allow you film least hour . )-cables programs ( cd comes camera install some programs save things you took onto your computer , if you don't anything already . )-compatibility ( nice light weight camera . )-included carrying case ( comes carrying case protect your camera even more . ) cons :-( confusing use first , it possible delete thigs without you knowing what you doing , however everything explained manual . )-clip lens protector ( it kinda bad after while , because it deos losen , however camera comes carrying case anyway so thats good . )-memory ( built memory not good all , so buy card or you won't enjoy this camera . ) anyway this camera perfect filming those little moments your life , like vacations or other things like . you easily tuck it somewhere where it won't bother you . however if you want perfect quality you won't find here . this camera deos great quality but its not perfec t.t his product most likely you love or hate , however i really loved it	1
i am amazed complaining $150 camera/camcorder . when you buy one these , don't expect it like $900 ones ! i taken several pictures clear high quality . camcorder exactly what i want it i am extremely pleased this unit . dxg something here help us all , but they not perfect . this unit exactly what i wanted i recommend it anyone market camera camcorder easy pocketbook	1
first off , this awesome camera price . there no other camera same price range which deliver this much performance quality money . those who talk low-light quality needs go out purchase themselves hotshoe light . who their right mind would shoot 15 , 30 or even 60 lux without external light anyway ? picture quality greatly hampered . i believe next spare battery , external light source probably most valuable accessory you own . this camera comes loaded all standard features other camcorders this price range also remote control included , which some competitors not standard . top , 3 ccd sensors !!! simply put , you not find better camcorder price ! period .	1
i bought hc96 replace my five year old trv11 which sony top line consumer model time . after using hc96 one week , i following observations . 1 ) camacorder charger much smaller than trv11 . build quality seems decent . i don't like docking station design , but it not show stopper . 2 ) video quality door/out door shooting only slightly better than trv11 despite great reviews i read internet . widescreen nice new feature compared trv 11.3 ) focusing under low night bit slow , i really wish manual focus ring when taking my daughter christmas stage performance . potential shopper should also check out gs500 which close competition	1
i received this camera gift few years ago i ended up falling love photography because it . it great beginners because it not expensive ... obviously what camera lacks megapixels zoom what you save dollars . but i taken hundreds gorgeous photos . it extremely user-friendly , unlike hps i've used , action shots never problem . just note you can't zoom while shooting movies ( mpeg ) but it pick up sound cleanly . i also found it very durable ... it dropped countless times , used outside during ( wisconsin ) winter , exposed both water sand but picture quality hasn't decreased . ( make sure you get case it- it doesn't come one but they're cheap . ) i'm now looking into freelance photography career , but until i save up enough one those fancy $ 700 deals , this one definitely get me through	1
kind people just want record life precious moments , this camera you . recording quality so-so suffers mildly low-light situations , this goes photos well . i find this camera very neat , it extremely light weight easy use . however , this my first dv camcorder , i yet figure out how transfer video tape computer . until then , my 1 gigabyte memory card trick . all-in-all , i recommend this camcorder anyone something small , yet simple use . it great use outdoors , well indoors , long lighting plenty	1
very compact great mini dv incredible price . my old sony died got this fraction price i paid sony	1
i've working professional photographer cinematographer over 10 years ; i tons exp . every kind camera market past present this camera i love carry me when i'm out . its slimmer then my cell phone , smaller than my wallet , rugged enough carried my most every day week . i've my over year now little zero problems it . t7 reacts fast changing environments distances . i underwater housing camera which i use weekly basis filming surfing videos images . this camera also special function i yet see work well camera , burst multi-burst functions . i captured 30 or so images split second thanks this function or switch it capture every 1/4 second 8 seconds . it ideal function fast action photography or sports photographer their day off . i highly recommend this camera anyone novice professional because its ease use adaptability situation . only thing i would ask canon would make their newest version camera just like this one add shockproof waterproof housing this awesome camera	1
i bought this camera my girlfriend , but i love it so much i always ask borrow it . i think it takes great pictures if you use tips manual , it works great almost every situation . i wish it casing made protective coating or special cover because it gets scratched very easily . i no problems it over year since purchased .	1
i love my camera . here why : 1 . pop-out screen . perfect when you crowd . you just tilt screen , rais your arms you know what you'll shooting . ( rather than just shooting blindly . ) also , get kids/pet shots . you tilt screen up you shoot your waist or knees without bend uncomfortably . con : it probably makes camera bit chunkier , but me it worth it . 2 . pixel size . it around 5mp it just right all-around shooting . it isn't too small where i lose details but it isn't too big where i'm always free up space my computer . con : i would prefer more mp but , this camera , it fine . 3 . controls . i found it simple enough all-around ' point shoot ' shots but it also features you control . i choose use my manual shutter aperture settings control my pictures . but if i hand my camera somebody who no idea how use one , they could just hit button shoot . con : settings seem overwhelm beginner ... first , but after reading manual bit , it should help . 4 . size . i am comfortable it size . but i know many would prefer smaller one . ( i guess would con it . ) it feels solid well made . screen not too small lense decent job getting shots you want . i use cushioned carrying case it it bit bulky but i'd rather protect it something like . this bit chunky your pocket but it still fit . ( don't forget grab yourself camera strap added protection against drops ! )5 . canon . i've owned canons while brand i stick . i found they well made cameras awesome . this one favorite . i take it anywhere . hopefully you too . enjoy	1
this excellent tripod sony video camera . i am using this my sony camcorder remote working pretty good . its legs strong . i am using same my nikon d50 ( remote not usable ) . i am satisfied performance . only one issue base where you attach camera plastic . so sometimes i am not comfortable my dslr its zoom len	1
i found this tripod sony website , but bit put off price , both there , circuit city . i thrilled find it much less amazon !!! tripod itself super ... we mostly shoot video our baby home , so we don't need anything too sophisticated . we love controls arm tripod , bubble-level thing good feature . highly recommend	1
this tripod simply amazing . it light-weighted enough ( 1.3 kg or 2 lbs 14 oz ) you would not feel burdened all when you take it out hiking . moreover , it works other types cameras instead limiting it sony products exclusively . i tried my 5 years old olympus 2020 digital camera it stayed there rock-solid . keep mind , however , attached remote only works sony-branded cameras/camcorders since remote requires you plug cable into equipment you intend use . i also try my newly bought sony camcorder mini-dv dcr-hc42 it worked flawlessly . included air bubble ingenious device it allows you see whether tripod level respect floor . thus , even if floor uneven , you always find best balanced spot looking air bubble that directly beneath tripod center leg . like reviewer said , this tripod gives user almost unlimited control you rotate it any angle you want , range 19 - 57 inches ( or 48 -145 cm ) , it almost satisfy any kind everyday use . finally , it great buy amazon because most people ebay selling roughly same price , minus great return policy amazon . i would absolutely recommend this tripod anyone who needs it any purpose .	1
i am just average guy when it comes using camera . probably below average . i started trying use 100% sony electronic products because my computer sony sony-sony linkages make easy use . given , here what i think product : 1 . it amazing how much camera you get money . compared just 6 months ago , or year ago , this lot camera money . it very small , fits easily your pocket , but takes great pictures . also , it very easy use recharge . 2 . visit sony website , suggests sony new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras very similar . this makes it hard compare cameras , even within sony brand , makes you feel if your camera obsolete minute you buy it . 3 . problem this camera , given it so small -- not shake . your pictures blurry . i am typical guy , very little fine motor control . my hands trouble holding small objects . holding this camera one hand taking picture -- well results not pleasant . 4 . i tend disappointed telephoto capabilities these small cameras . i guess if you really want zoom , then you go big camera . but it still seems like small cameras could offer more . 5 . said all , end , this camera small easy carry , light weight , durable , it also easy use . when you look it , it looks well made . i ended up giving camera my in-laws , because they lost theirs . my in-laws tend technologically challenged . i said them , just leave dial set little green camera , snap away . i say - they love this camera . overall . money , great purchase , technology amazing . just grab it two hands or develop steadier aim than i .	1
befores this camera i cybershot user ; since i believe this camera great characteristics : good flash level take close pictures , several especialized modes , compact size 10x zoom , great outdoors pictures ( vivids colorfuls ) . my main complain software : i not choose diferent flash intensity levels ( shots not well iluminated indoors really poor)and i not choose iso mode ( avoid bad pictures objects moving ) . besides night shots mode not good i expected . my general opinion this camera could really better if software would more versatile	1

i bought this camera because i unhappy my 3.5 megapixel one produced grainy pictures . i am so happy i . c875 very easy use ( even beginner like me ) produces crisp , superb photos . you take one photo after without wait too long shots . i recently shared my pics when i got back vacation i got lot comments how clear sharp pictures how vibrant colors . i can't believe i got such great camera under $200 .	1

therre many camcorders market many superior this one . however you pay much more money , this price range it wouldbe impossible find better camcorder . easy use powerful zoom ( better more powerfull more expensive camcorders ) connects easily mac or pc it offerssomething similar camcorders not : possibility set your manual settings ( if you wish so ) experiment . users ewant it simple , auto settings deliver you excellent result . again if you want something more than you should look elsewhere pay more . but price this best bu	1
well i paid $330 this year ago . i thinks its best camcorder value . image quality excellent well lit conditions . if you shooting dim light i would suggest use auxillary light . i wish camcorder came shoe light attachment . there lot manual controls if used properly improve picture quality lot dim conditions . joy stick control easy use settings changed one hand . all all its very good camcorder . few tips get most out this one . - use auxillary light dim conditions . - make sure not record directly into bright light . - buy extra capacity battery	1
after researching several cameras this price range , i bought rebel t2 last month . it met my expectations perhaps then some . after recently trying out friends camera 150 . -ish range , i partially regret spending what i . it all comes down what you need , want , how many bells whistles you like . money though , compared competitors , i still think i made good purchase . after all , if i use it ten years , which i most likely , i surely got my moneys worth . bottom line : no complaints it	1
i recently started small photography business doing black white shots kids their natural environment . i wanted camera took quality shots , but still cost effective . i most definitely found it . my cannon takes great shots allows me mobility needed chase kids around . very pleased .	1
i really like this camera it current price it hard beat . there lot said already but i think what it boils down when choosing f20 f30 - you want pay more " dial " - more later . pros ( order importance me)1 . excellent low light shots ! i cannot emphasize this enough . but please don't compare it dslr - that simply not fair . i compared it canon sd700 - i carried both testing took identical shots . fuji outperforms canon hands down this department . fuji took clear shots inside libraries museums using natural light which specifically what i wanted . canon produced photos natural light grainy blurry . i prefer use natural lighting much i so this probably most important factor me . 2 . out box simplicity . i read somewhere someone saying this not good ps . i not agree . my so visiting dc baltimore area i debated which camera give him - canon or fuji . this most un-technical person i know - he still trouble whole " holding shutter halfway down focus " digital cameras . however , knowing he would museums , memorials , etc , i gave him fuji made sure after i played it , it all set back auto . he came back beautiful clear shots ! far nicer then anything he able achieve previous digital cameras . most indoor photos used natural light his flash outdoor photos came out great - all set auto . 3 . nice size solid construction . this not " plastic " camera like couple others we our house cost nearly same . it metal feels solid your hands . it not compact others ( like canon sd700 ) but actually me , it better . i don't big hands all , but some smaller cameras just too small even me . it small enough pocket or purse . 4 . lots scene selections when you want experiment . this camera gives you lot pseudo-manual controls play but not like slr where you adjust shutter/aperture . it gives you enough experiment manipulate . read specs - i won't go into them all here except say natural/flash mode genius ! which leads me cons1 . nearly everything menu driven . i find this cumbersome times . i think i would happier f30 . but i new fuji didn't want sink much money into camera brand i unfamiliar so c'est la vie . here example how it annoyed me : we're forest i've gone thru menus select macro setting - minimum 6 clicks menu system . i am taking closeups some foliage when behind me , my golden retriever something comical i would loved take picture , but i don't even try shot knowing macro mode , there little hope good outcome it would take too long get it back auto mode using menu system . canon , i could quickly moved external dial auto tried shot . i know this bit extreme example but i wanted share it knowing lot you , like myself , want experiment scene selections but also use auto . if you think you're going use auto most time , then it probably little consequence you . but you may want consider f30 this reason . now there * * button back called f-mode which there allow you make some quick settings changes . it basically smaller selection menu which means you'd get your settings quicker , but what fuji chose place this shorter selection menu befuddling me . i see value iso setting there but honestly , other two settings ( imo ) dumb . picture quality ( choosing normal , fine , few others ) something i usually set once forget . this belongs only longer more tedious menu selection . same other selection - finepix color where you choose normal , chroma , bw . if i'm setting those i'm thinking shots - they don't need " quick pick " menu . i think fuji should replace one those quick pick setting puts camera all auto mode . maybe i just haven't found way it - if there simple fast way get into auto mode , then someone please tell me . one few external buttons anti-blur button it very handy . 2 . like everyone else - i dislike charging system . you purchase standalone charger however . 3 . xd card - everything else i life takes sd cards . my card reader doesn't read xd . mild annoyance . 4 . i don't particularly like slow zooming when playback mode . 5 . slower then other camaeras when deleting photos camera formatting card . rest - lcd quality , no optical viewfinder ( canon one but it so tiny it hardly worth it ) battery life , zoom , macro mode all good enough - not spectacular f20 , but not bad either . they really weren't much factor my buying decision . all all - i really like this camera use it lot . there some annoying quirks but they simply don't overshadow wonderful photos it produces - especially low light when compared other compact cameras .	1
i call cameras like this phd ( push here dummy ) because i not work camera more than simplest systems . this camera works great me . very compact light good battery life . it works low light bright image stabilization work well i get nice sharp pictures now . display back nice large given small size camera . image display clear bright even brightest light outside . i wish there docking station like i fuji finepix f410 . it great gizmo made charging camera down loading pictures very easybuy it enjoy it if you like me , overwhelmed complicated gizmos , this simple straight forward camera use .	1
this nice carrying case , magnetic closure makes it easy get camera out . belt loop snap closure which sometimes pop other cases i've used , but i not problem this case yet	1
i bought this rangefinder golf , but thought it might also work hunting . it small enough i keep it my pocket pull it out when needed . i tried it heavy brush , but find mixed results close range . you get good results objects beyond 50 yards utilizing " ignore close objects " function . i pulled it out rifle range today during snow shower pleasantly surprised get reading 101 yards my target bench 1 yard back firing line . snow not affect results rangefinder all ... probably more effect bullet path	1
this rangefinder great ! much lighter than big bulky other units . all great features needed . this one you take you not leave truck because it too big . i tested this against some my buddies ' bigger units known distances this one out bigger units speed accuracy . great scan mode . best buy . should sold ($) more than asked	1
bought this go canon 350xt we bought our father law . it perfect kit beginner quality products good .	1
great camera many useful features . no usb cable included however which led 4 week chase no results yet amazon , nikon , or cameta camera , supplier . poor followup this case . now i understand nikon no longer supplies this cable .	1
i purchased this camera before our trip hawaii , not repented ... it delivers clear photos , very flexible set pre-programmed settings ... must purchase folks move	1
this camera everything it says ; yes , it waterproof i very uneasy taking digital camera into water first time !! only reason i didn't give it 5 stars : it slow every other digital camera i've owned far focusing , multiple flashes , then actually shooting . you get your subject attention they smile , frozen , you hold down shutter release good 3 seconds until shot taken ( low light . ) i especially intrigued its " bright capture " technology , but it honestly doesn't seem any different low light than my old sony u20 2mp tiny little snapshot camera . still same flash-in-the-dark look . there fill-flash low light program mode ( among many many others ) , but shutter speed sets itself so slow background becomes messy worthless blob , even if you hold your breath try remain still . my ideal snapshot camera portable , durable , quick , easy , produces excellent results without think your exposure modes . this camera 3.5 out those 5 . it way portable , very durable , easy , produces ok results but you mess settings if you're not daylight , it not very quick . overall i am very happy purchase carry it everywhere	1
excellent , light weight professional looking camera . haven't used it long enough so it take some time able master it full capabilities . i used like idea removable lens , but fuji finepix fixed lens , it really doesn't matter much , there additional lens attached it .	1
this very good camera , it certainly let you lot creative work . downside , pics sometimes little dull . i found after i bought it same money i could bought konica dimage a200 optical stabilization syste	1

it long time since i used tripod but i managed get it set up without reading instructions . there no instructions so save box helpful hints . tripod fit my purpose : mostly indoor use planned . it hard get it truely static when pressing shutter release minolta dimage . i also horizontally challenged - base little level below ( below ) camera pad . i would not take this rugged outdoor adventure many uneven surfaces ( they need make titaniium one get it this light but durable ; start saving now . ) i would not use it around kids , old folks , crowds , or any combination these because your expensive electonic gizmo going going fly thru air greatest ease . nylon or tyvek travel case would helpful item	1
this nice quality built bag . i love detachable lower compartment which i use store extra video cables minidv tapes . my camcorder small fits snuggly , so if your camera any bigger or you leave tripod attachment -- beware it may not fit . i would like little more room , but overall i'm happy purchase	1
i recently purchased this camera when my venerable nikormat el-w developed shutter timing issues during my photo 1 class . this camera reasonably priced preformed flawlessly thus far . i shot multiple rolls ilford hp5 plus film through this camera yet exposure not come out due camera . after reading manual i able easily understand different modes how change user controlled settings . camera flash leaves little desired it rather harsh its range somewhat limited , accessory flash overcome this there other flashes operate this camera not just canon . i not opportunity shooting color film through this camera yet when i i update this review . only thing i dislike this camera there no provision remote shutter release . rebel k2 date only version this camera use remote shutter release , why canon removed this feature this model unknown remote release very handy when photographing nature or when used timer self portraits . if you any plans infrared photography not buy eos canon , frame counter uses infrared sensor cause fogging your infrared film	1
i am really satisfied purchase this camera . good quality workmanship . canon leader photography my book . easy use controls any one	1
this great little camera . we olympus 3.2 meg still camera 10 time optic zoom it great camera although it little slow focus small lcd . this panasonic real fast still camera much larger lcd it also 10 time optic zoomand doubles video camera record dvd . it real easy use we love it . what more could you want ? amazon great price you trust them	1
i using mine 2 months now . picture quality very good . i purchased sima light add . it enhances pictures even better . still pictures amazing too . i trying decide sony this one . finally decided this one because picture quality .	1
this first 5 star rating i ever given amazon ! i chose hv20 preparation week long shoot north south india . i ready purchase new panasonic hvx200 ( approximately $ 5,000 ); but $ 1,100 hv20 camera actually some major advantages convinced me it better choice my project . biggest factor my choice hv20 editing capability . hv20 hdv format compatible editing packages like adobe premier pro , whereas formats recorded ( i.e. avhcd or hd50 ) other products panasonic sony not very compatible editing packages may impossible or require extra steps post processing . regarding image quality , camera earns wow ! i think this camera currently very best option solo shoot go . other reviews say it all regarding image quality , color , etc . external hot shoe audio also big deal high quality shooting . lcd screen sharp feature impose horizontal line or grid screen ( but not recorded ) very handy maintain level shots . camera not tiny , but small enough slipped into very large trouser pocket ; this allowed access more spontaneous shooting opportunities than larger hd camera options . large fanny pack , i kept camera ( extra tapes , batteries , monopod , dm50 microphone ) me all times ready anything . this portability factor transcends price point . regarding storage , hv20 records hdv directly dv tape . much more expensive hvx200 record hd50 format ( which equivalent or possibly superior format ) but only record sd ( not hd ) tape ; hxv200 , proprietary p2 cards required hd recording ( 8gb p2 card costs approximately $ 1,100 ) . i bought this camera price one 8gb p2 card ! recording tape seemed like disadvantage first , but advantage india huge - i not need transfer anything my pc or need pc ) until i good ready ( so i could maximize shooting time site deal all post production later ); addition , archival handled up front less compression no spaces constraints - more tapes could not solve ; after shooting 10 tapes , i realized this also significant advantage . i also took over 1,000 3.1 megapixel still shots camera 2gb card . camera layout quite good . tape battery swapped out without removing tripod or monopod mount . unplanned situations , this major advantage . few ways camera could improved : 1 ) lens width varies when switching video still modes , so i expect editing stills into my video take extra time2 ) after market wide angle lens , wide shot shows black edges lens , settable zoom stop would help when zooming back wide . 3 ) manual focus not intuitive , more feedback dial would help4 ) switching auto programmable mode would better if some auto functions could set stay 5 ) auto backlight feature would handy6 ) minisd card strange inconvenient choice still photo storage , since i could not reuse sd cards i already own ( note no memory card included camera ) 7 ) video input ( like samsung product ) , so i could keep camera my pocket shoot lipstick cam when necessary ( avoid looking like typical american tourist or action/sports applications)8 ) battery life shorter than expected , i got 1 hour each battery . net net , this camera fantastic i believe video quality sufficent qualify my project my first film festival submission	1
i sony fx1 since 2 years then i bought sony hc1 which i return due unacceptable video noise low light conditions . when you used sony fx1 you know how low light videos supposed look , so i something good compare hv20 . i got this hv20 camera i played it checking its potential outdoor indoors . i switched 24p 1080i same shot same lighting conditions see 24p really make video cleaner low light , it way better than sony hc1 which i bought . course sony fx1 low light footage much better than hv20 , but using 24p low light make hv20 acceptable . i could not really make out difference fx ! hv20 bright daytime videos other than hv20 more color saturation . my fears laid rest i like hv20 low light daylight videos . 1/3rd price sony fx1 this camera keeper . 24p something which some people like some wont . action or movement objects appear little jerky 24p which expected , but it look different 1080i . non moving shots 24p looks great . if you pan camera 24p mode video stutter pretty apparen t.t o give you idea what 24p looks like imagine watching video monitor which low refresh rate you see ghost object follow object after it moves . i took camera drove around night see how it handles nightlights ... 24p mode not something you would use situation whenever you pan camera blurring effect becomes very pronounced due lights . but still video pretty good . 24p mode cinema effect added makes it little bit better . 1080i mode looks pretty good without 24p motion blur while i took drive . i connected hv20 my 42inch 1080p lcd tv through hdmi it looks really good . i surprised . outdoor videos very sharp colorful . indoor videos also pretty good . more saturated colors than sony fx1 but very nice look . it difficult get steady shots camera it lighter . if you keep you hand steady during shots footage good hd channels . but it great take it disney or vacations without carry sony fx1 bulk . it neat little timer which displays 10secs when you start record so you not make shot too short or too abrupt . battery life little more than hour lcd open so i bought extra bp-2l14 battery . hopefully they come out great fx1 low light performance such small package soon . overall this very good buy . you love playing 24p mode . conclusions .. very light , pretty fast auto focusing , small form factor , 24p mode video , good low light videos , really great daytime videos wife loves this camera it much smaller than fx1 !	1
my fuji camera " only " take fuji brand batteries - it not take anything else comparable so i rate this excellent .	1
worked advertised right out box . would buy family well	1
this item terrific its intended purpose - small reminders good memories you carry you . other reviews indicated , though , not expect awesome picture quality . sentimental value not diminished , though	1
some times there problems getting dvd finalize especially if you let battery run down . run time battery only 20 minutes max , prepared purchase additional batteries	1
this good camera money ...... i use 35mm times instead my digital ... this great price	1
one reasons i bought this camera description power source : " requires two aa batteries -- included " . i sick buying expensive cells camera store , i always sleeve aa batts around house . sounded great . oops ! when camera arrived i opened battery door , there nothing inside , when i checked manual i learned no aa need apply . back camera store ! ten bucks pair lithium cells . battery , says manual , should good ten rolls film . so add lifetime cost camera . it neat little camera , i'm not planning return it . but i wee bit disappointed	1
targus dpmv02 pro series video/photo backpack . i put both my digital cameras , all my lenses , flashes , my mp3 player . padded sections keep everything getting scratched everything else . it also keeps everything nice neat . pack looks small but it held all my stuff ease . padded dividers also keep it very quit which great cause i take lot wildlife photos . pack isn't small but it compact it stays high my back when i'm walking through tall brush . also it smooth so i'm not snagging it all time things . :) it convenient cell phone pocket you situate bunch places straps . only thing i found it lacking spot my tripod or bag	1
i needed lens adapter my kodak p712 . this one fit bill price right . fits like glove my telephoto lens . great price , fast delivery . very happy	1
this must cable if you're going transfer your videos your computer . sony not supply cable its hd camcorders . if you edit your videos and/or make dvds , you need this cable	1
i needed extra battery my kodak p880 . this battery recommended kodak . it works like charm . i like 2 batterys , i never worry my camera dying . if you're looking replacement battery or extra battery your kodak camera , this great one	1
got what i feel great price . these batteries , kodaks ones , haven't tried knock-offs , but they seem last forever . you go out into boonies 1 camera charged backup , i seems incomprehensible me you could run out resources . jbgtucso	1
this camera isn't intended semi pro , you probably aren't going win photography contests it , but someone who wants good point shoot camera take spur moment pictures , this camera works great . i took 30-40 pictures 5 min video when i took kids park today , camera didn't interfere our fun . i'm surprised how much video i am starting shoot it . controls extremely easy use . they even made exposure compensation easy . controls very well thought out which large part why it seems so simple/basic . it also comes good manual . finally , i find it fairly fast digital camera . we higher end digital everything , but controls so cumbersome it takes forever get it set up . also , i take camera bag or least carry it around my neck . this thing goes comfortably pocket . yeah , this camera isn't capable taking high quality pictures , but practice i am getting 5-10 times many good pictures enjoying myself process . picture quality good , i've noticed no distortion wide angle lens even distortion compensation turned off . regards some complaints .... 1 . easyshare setup annoying day or two , but if one keeps dock near your pc , it actually nice feature . i snap camera , press one button download , i am . still not happy , then get sd card reader off ebay . they dirt cheap . 2 . battery life included lithium ion battery good , because they use same battery multiple models , aftermarket batteries chargers available next nothing . this huge bonus this camera . 3 . yep , it probably lacking when it comes quality night photography , if you planning taking lot pictures night , then get camera . this pretty common complaint pocket cameras . 4 . semi-pros probably not satisfied lack alternative formats or ability tweak settings , but it point shoot after all	1
used this several times now love wide angle lens . stitching panorama shots good ( better practice pivoting rather than panning camera)quality acceptable point shoot but not sharp or clear my canon dslr . battery life good , start up time decently quick ( ~ 1.5 sec . ) transfer pc one touch easy . many ( almost too many ) picture modes . cons : flash weak , low light performance marginal best . overall , good pocket camera daytime parties , landscape impulse photography . superwide angle lens huge plus those situations warrant it ( real estate pics , group photos , vacation panoramas ) . rguard	1
we received skyquest xt 4.5 two weeks ago we absolutely love it . my six year old daughter i opened two boxes , put it together , within 15 minutes we out front our house looking moon , start clusters , moons cloud bands jupiter , andromeda galaxy . it big enough see all these things big city yet it small enough easily fit closet . if you looking light weight scope you pull out closet whim , big enough see items mentioned above , easy enough kid use , this one	1
after trying becoming frustrated department store telescopes , i spent lot time researching internet find scope both fit my needs beginner fit my budget . no matter how i looked it , this scope kept coming out top list . i've using it over month now not disappointed any way ! it ultra-portable , gives great views , took rank amateur ( me ) less than hour assemble align optics , thanks very good instruction manual . small size plus me . i keep it fully assembled sitting guest bedroom pick it up easily carry it out yard one piece . i just lay out blanket sit lawn observe - no need setup , fancy chairs , or tables . eyepiece perfect height my 4yr old daughter look through ( she already gotten few glimpses moon ) so it great tool us share . when she little bit bigger she easily able handle this scope herself . bigger scope give better/more powerful views , but if you tight budget , want something simple rugged , or want very portable scope , this your ticket ! after your first view jupiter ( its cloud bands moons ) you won't regret this purchase . --------- update 1 year later ! i just re-read this review i put up , can't reiterate it enough - this great little beginner scope ! last fall i bought one books i recommended this scope , " starwatch " phil harrington . just last week , i completed seasonal sky windows book - allowing me see all 110 messier dso all using this little 4.5 " scope ! if goofball like me figure out how use this scope use " starwatch " log all messier year - you too ! its great combo !!	1
bag pretty good , but it bit tight digital camera i bought . not flaw case , but not best ultra zoom type digital cameras	1
i bought this bag sony dcr trv19 mini dv camcorder . it enough room cables , power supply , external mic three tapes . not huge but sufficient if you want keep size minimum . i owned targus laptop computer bags found them high quality durability . so far this bag living up its legacy . i bought it sale 9.99 . i would still pay 12 bucks it	1
this fabulous gift grandparents if you preload pictures . just aware customer support folks not knowledgeable , probably since product new . don't bypass their software load pix if you're transferring your pc frame - their software reduces memory needed each one . even though software different size frames labelled same , it not compatible you only one version installed your pc time	1
i like way this charger keeps it simple . it small enough pack take it you it charges batteries fast . great keeping my backup battery charged ready	1
this printer works very well our system . it great print quality speed acceptable . only complaint i you use kodak paper comes cartridges	1
overall excellent video camera ( vc ) . this my second sony most liekly buy anohter sony when this one wears out or becomes obscelete . records digital digital 8 tape . i'd probably go ahead get dvd recorder or hdd recorder , except price thsi much more reasonable i kenw what expect sony dcr line vcs . would recommend anyone who looking basic vc record those events life ... children too ...	1
i really enjoyed using my camcorder . it so small lightweight picture quality very good . maybe lack experience , zoom function felt little awkward . picture tells thousand words , but camcorder , well it next best thing taking my mother who unable travel . she agreed when she saw tape .	1
i this lens two months i love it . it allows me get really close subjects . you even subject touching lens still focus . lens great quality . amazon least expensive site i found this product . great shipping tracking . i highly recommend this product all dsc-h1 or h2 or h5 owners	1
great close up lens , would love buy telephoto lens my sony dsc-h	1

we bought jvc bn-vf714u protect us " dead battery exactly wrong moment " syndrome . multiple occasions , we've used battery 2+ hours vf lcd use whole time . after 3 months use , i'd recommend battery anyone buying camcorder	1
first all , camera this goes slightly dissappointing . that beside point this review though . reason you probably looking this product because you might tired standard battery short lifespan . this product lives up three hour life when you use it viewfinder mode . only thing i don't like battery size . it extends further than standard one it almost embarrasing it . other than size battery great i would say must accessory this particular camera	1
external battery charger works great so far . i haven't noticed difference performance yet when comparing charges this product versus charging battery camera cradle . it takes less than hour charge completely . long awaited product since you don't want carry camera cradle everywhere	1
i recently purchased couple items amazon , casio np-40 battery casio bc-30l charger my ex-z750 digital camera . i am happy products impressed quick delivery packaging . you sure i ordering more items amazone confidence	1
i always slr photographer held off purchasing digital camera up until now because i not convinced resolution capabilities digital . i travel alot sometimes due space sometimes due desire inconspicuous i needed something smaller than my full size slrs . after lot research , looking every model i could find , i settled this panasonic lumix lx2 because i don't give up control over every aspect photo . this camera lets you control freak , or you leave it one several automatic modes . it store pictures raw mode , which important me ( canon g7 lost out because it didnt this ) but jpeg mode great . i blown up some prints this camera i am completely satisfied quality , i skeptical before , expecting underwhelmed . i originally bought this backup my slrs but i already see this my primary camera unless i am situation calls special lens , flash power , or super high resolution ( like 25 or 60 asa)my only suggestion panasonic would allow you charge battery while camera , like car charger , make some sort accomodation external flash . flash this camera weak spot - it really not bad size but if it could sync external flash would good	1
i've this camera month . i currently own nikon d50 2 year old canon powershot . i needed something small handy use walk around camera . i've reading reviews months various digital cameras , poured through thousands images posted flickr , i decided this camera . i loved look , size , price , leica lens . images sharper colors more vibrant than my nikon d50 my canon powershot . i love manual settings available this camera . i mostly use setting . although adjusting shutter speed aperture awkward using joystick , menu very simple offers lot control . i also like fact people stop me street whenever i use my camera	1
i love this tripod ! i am extremely happy my purchase . it built heavy duty ( like its name implies ) . all controls operate easily stay position you put them . it trust-worthy piece equipment definitely make my ' shooting sessions ' easier , higher quality photo . quick shipping well packaged . i'm happy all way around this purchase . bubble level feet which allow soft stand or spiked stand nice well actually used ( unlike similar ones not dependable ) . most definitely worth investment	1
tripod easy adjust , just right height , fits my large suitcase very attractive . i wish it came carrying case or least built-in handle . i leery its low price " " shaped legs but it well made very sturdy . legs easy set-up different lengths , case you working non-level surface . i'm concerned handle plastic pan-head tight when trying move up down	1
me encanta esta camara , antes de �sta estuve cambiando c�mara cada 2 o tres meses , ahora me quedo con esta , es muy atractiva , funciona excelente , los videos son buen�simos , talvez se compara con la calidad del hi8 . como la mayor�a de las c�mara compactas , las fotos nocturnas no son muy buenas , el flash no tiene mucho alcance , aunque es mucho mejor que el de la sony , en general , un producto totalmente recomendado	1
this my second kodak compact digital camera . previous one i owned v530 which very similar this camera . i hoping v603 would correct one problem plagued v530 -- consistently dark pictures full automatic mode . turns out this problem persists this camera too , probably result using common software within both these camera models . but least v603 " perfect touch " picture fixup capability which , when applied dark picture , generally fixes problem . but you fix each picture individually using perfect touch which somewhat hassle . other nice thing this camera comparison v530 ability charge battery in-camera . camera nice , sleek body good , solid feel . overall not too bad camera	1
this camera actually purchased my teenage daughter . this our 4th easyshare camera i would highly recommend it everyone . i purchased different easyshare march , although it wonderful , once i saw how small easy use this one - i wish i would waited got this same one instead . i find myself borrowing this one my daughter using it more than my own ( which also wonderful camera ) ..	1
lumix dmc-lz2 5mp digital camera easy use takes great pictures . only gripe i flash could stronger . i set iso 400 take indoor pictures without flash . resulting pictures usually superior ones taken flash . it worth money	1
well this not my first digital camera , i g5 , g6 a620 . i am used them focusing real well first time around most time . i expected r1 focus well first time i shot , it didn't though so i very dissapointed this . i found out some auto focus features need turned off order it focus better it help alot but focus slow . money i spent i expected better focus area . lens great photo quality very good . it just not quick . battery life very good . camera feels pretty good hands but i would liked see metal . i don't like plastic cameras . i want feel i own something when i hold it . i don't care how light it . i am happy my camera least fact quality shots good any digital slr . i am glad it good lens i don't like buy alot lens so sony good this aspect r1 . if i knew what i know now i might not bought r1 maybe i would went something else . if something else little better speed area focus . but when i think it there not many choices something good lens already not mirror reflex where one worry dust . this one better respect . this why i give camera 4 because sony could perfected this camera but they not .	1
i just my r1 week now i love it . summary , it awesome camera . takes great quality pictures true colors great details . i got it $650 price , i'd say it bargain . if you're market full size professional digital camera , r1 camera you've looking . addition awesome quality pictures it takes , 5x zoom , long battery life , cf memorystick options , swifel lcd screen , etc .. makes this camera even more competitive	1
i own 2 nikon en-el1 batteries taken total over 6,000 photos my nikon 4300 past 3 years . half photos flash . my typical use , i get 50 photos per battery . vacation photos , i am using one battery , while charging other . after 3,000 photos/battery 3 years , i not noticed any degradation battery life . good value money .	1
i nikon coolpix 4300 digital two these batterys . they work great long they last which not 2 hours my case . maybe it because i leave monitor flash most time take my pictures large size . all all two these battery i never run out juice	1
plastic o ring carrying case which holds large shoulder strap came broken . thus it renders case un-useable . time , my cost it would file complaint ship case back not worth it me . however if bushnell would send me new carrying case , i would very pleased transaction . howard . rutkowski	1
this great set . eyepieces high qualiity . case very durable well . i not played filters yet , but they screw easily into any eyepiece . $60.00 , you not go wrong . amazon great place save this item	1
i bought one these cameras because it cheap , kodak pretty good reputation . however , i found quality pictures it takes rather low , it consumes batteries very quickly . it doesn't zoom , so unless you're close something , it won't take very good picture . once picture scanned onto computer , or printed , it very grainy pixellated . you get other brands similar price much better quality	-1
case fits all camera gear isn't too bulky or large . we're very happy our purchase	1
i really enjoy this small , high quality camara . i purchased 2.0 gb memory disk so i could take advantage 7.1 mega pixel . i get great pix everytime . i lots fun it . since its so small , it easy take everywhere me . i also get lots compliments it " fashionable " sleek design . i highly recomend his camera .	1
i got this camera bag hoping all camera stuff ( charger , cables tapes ) fit it , photos net not clear enough , but i found product good material , suitable color , took every thing i need even my digital camera bag . i faced only one problem my canon elura 100 camcorder too small compared space inside bag , i put it upside down ( lense facing bottom ) , so i added soft pad bottom apply more protection bag default normal bottom layer not giving shock absorbtion if bag fall down hit ground	1
it provides essentials i looking store my camera extra battery . perfect size	1

i am extremely pleased this camera . i used it variety different photographic situations such : sport events , low light no light , indoor without flash , beach , indoor sun shinning windows , close ups zoom , it excelled every one ! i like it much better than my 35mm slr ( pentax me super )	1

i bought third party charger save money instead buying this one . third party charger died after 3 months no obvious reason . then i bought this one . it works perfectly , i expect it foreseeable future , i've never problem official canon merchandise . , it came power cords compatible just every type wall socket existence ( very convenient if you travel like i ) . don't waste your time money third party piece junk . buy this charger instead	1
i purchased this product reading other buyer reviews but when i used this product , i fully satisfied .	1
i've owned my rebel now almost year this charger i use both my batteries ! ( one time .. :-)) one person stated , once you learn how put battery it becomes second nature . ( it doesn't just slide it , but started near top . ) i no problem recommending this charger	1
get 1.8 aperture , super sharp , prime lens " " coveted nikon name it under $100 dollars still hard me comprehend . i continue awed i go out shooting dreamlike state ... wake me when its over ... my only lingering question ... " it last ? " ... hey nikon , how offering up some more this prime candy some us who consider great value important part purchasing equation . thanks . enjoy :)	1
if you buy this nikon d40 , please read title again . if you quick read other reviews , you may not get read some mention fact this lens not autofocus nikon d40 . if you don't care this , you'll find this little lens great . pictures crisp clear , full light . great addition your lens collection	1
i like this len light weight , sharp focus ability shoot low lights . it make noticeable sounds it brings focus , but not untolerable . if you single love photography , get it .... you know you want it . if you married , then convince your spouse $100 worth month latte , you stop drinking latte month get this lens ..... that what i i not regret it bit .	1
i lot hiking looking something lighter weight than slr would still allow me take telephoto macro shots . this camera smallest lightest one i found 8x or higher zoom . i taken very sharp telephoto photos wildlife macro shots flowers people thought taken high-end camera . this camera well conventional landscapes indoor flash snapshots . menu controls very easy use there enough presets special situations compensate lack manual controls . however , if you mostly take snapshots not require 8x zoom , i would look other models . while , this small long zoom camera , it still too big easily fit pocket or purse . primary flaws this camera : it only 4 megapixels . battery charger failed replaced 18 months after purchase ( this particularly problem since camera takes propietary battery rather than aas ) . delay taking pictures longer than many competitors . occasionally lens cap not open completely ( easily fixed if you notice it before snapping your picture ) .	1
i bought nikon coolpix 4800 digital camera two weeks ago . most important feature i looked forward 8.3 optical zoom . picture quality great menu easy use . camera body very handy user-friendly . battery charges quickly lasts long . user manual simple easy understand . excellent video quality added bonus ! one improvement i would like suggest nikon making lens cover more robust or providing additional cap . users , using tripod full zoom recommended . all all great camera	1
i extremely impressed this camera ; i felt only not exceptional feature its nonwithstanding aptitude steady shots . other than , i felt it fantastic , exceeded all expectations	1
charger works great , i use it my flash which holds 2 4 batteries , so i always 2 standby . quick charge works great well	1
i first used this combo binoculars/digital camera recent vacation kenya . quality exceeded my expectations . i expecially liked we could also take mini videos ( up 30 secs ) animals well stills . negative : battery compartment not well designed inserting batteries sometimes frustrating . overall , i am really glad i purchased this product . it alot fun use	1
i really excited receive bushnell instant replay birthday present . however , i quickly learned it incredibly difficult binocular operate . first all , i trouble opening battery compartment cover . i pry it out knife after many unsuccessful attempts . then i hard time installing flash memory card . instruction booklet terrible not mention right way instal it . i installed it wrong way it got jammed so i pry it out pair pliers !! after doing all , i got camera work . then i decided i instal software - driver photosuite . driver installed easily . not so photosuite . after three attempts , icon not appear nor it appear programs . i'm returning camera	-1
i bought this camera looking better 1 than i ... it works great , priced good .. m/pixels , features , little complicated someone never used 1 , plz read manual ...	1
i am very pleased this camera , though i am still trying learn all features . this my third digital camera hopefully my last . it takes fantastic pictures .	1
this my third kodak camera . i love zoom image stabilization this one . kodak cameras so easy use ! only thing i am little dissapointed shutter response time when camera highest quality setting using flash . it still hard get those instant action shots . however , it better than cameras i past picture quality fabulous	1
i bought this camera replace fuji i bought 3 years ago ( which amazing workhorse camera until i dropped it one too many times ... ) . after much research , i chose this one because i happy fuji , already great xd card , this looked like it would fill order . it ever ! first assignment ? family trip disney . after one read-through manual , i felt comfortable using it action , low-light , no flash , fireworks pictures , they all turned out beautifully . downloading pics quick easy . display huge . battery life concern me , i really happy , although i purchasing extra battery my personal satisfaction . variety light , zoom , flash conditions , my camera took approx 120 pics 2 megapixels before battery became concern . i took many more days where outdoor photos not require my flash . i love able some basic editing right camera , such picture rotation digital zoom . busy mom , it saves time . i'm looking forward discovering even more summer requires more pictures , but consider this average picture-taking mom completely satisfied	1
amazon mistakenly sent underwater housing instead camera . mean time i ordered different camera ( canon sd700 ) . i returned this camera using downloaded ups return labels refunded entire amount i paid since this amazon mistake . kudos amazon !	1
i've canon digital cameras past two years my first , opted purchase accompanying canon camera case . though it good fit , it couple flaws caused me look elsewhere case when i got my second digital camera this year . this time around , i chose tamrac case because , unlike canon , it zips closed . canon flap closure creates two big gaps either side case , allowing small particles get inside camera itself . second , tamrac features not only belt loop , like canon , but nice shoulder strap . this means user carry camera hands free without put it purse or backpack . this case fits many small film slim digital cameras ( go tamrac website download spec sheet lists camera/case compatability ) , so don't expect custom fit . my canon a510 , this case bit long side , but no so much so i concerned it shifting around too much case . it good bag great manufacturer decent price . recommended	1
after much research i finally found binoculars fit my every need . price right , delivery right schedule , product excellent	1
first hotshoe bubble level i purchased survived whole year half before it fell off my camera somewhere northern iceland ( i spend several hours back tracking but i unable find this bright green $30 piece plastic snow ) . far tools go , this one most frequently used item my camera bag . i use it vast majority my shots ensure i level horizon ( which makes stitching panoramic shots much easier ) . only drawbacks plastic may eventually wear away enough it no longer fits hotshoe leaving it rather prone slipping out without much force price : it $30 piece plastic air bubble ! all fairness , it hold up abrasion rather well	1
i looking basic pair binoculars our everyday use . i some really expensive leupold binoclulars my favorite , but all around family use , especially kids , this great option . they waterproof , rubber coated protection , powerful ( 10x ) , focus easily adjustable . money ? it great buy	1
i just got kit today . i think it great deal price . my camera fits into bag perfectly . i kodak cx7300 . if your camera larger than , i don't think it going fit bag . that just my opinion . :	1
mobicam ultra lived up every expectation i video monitoring systems . i wouldn't baby without mobicam ultra . audio reception crystal clear . night video little hard see but it clear enough tell if your child moving around or his eyes open . regular video also crystal clear . only issue i video starts bad reception within house if you get more than 50 feet camera but sound works when i walk outside backyard or get mail . ( 200 feet ) i would suggest this model anyone interested good quality baby video monitoring system	1
this one better grades film i started using . it great saturation sharpness colors , exceptional film	1
i bought this camera october 2004- when product first released . i zero problems it , nothing but best things say it photo capabilities . i think this best balance quality price . besides , you don't need more than 7.1 mp any photography . if i shot photos full 7.1 mp i could make life size posters ! true test this camera ( me ) when i went vacation up california coast . i shot most amazing pictures big sur . detail exquisite , color amazing . since i purchased this camera , my photoshop days over . i never adjust color any shot i take , why i love this camera so much . if you looking camera capabilities slr without size slr , this definitely one get .	1
price low , then quality high . my doughter take photo almost everyday . little bit bigger size camera but photo quality much nicer than other compact camera .	1
i've only camera few weeks now , but i already love it . it fits my hand perfectly , lens excellent , startup time great too . i've particular fun super macro mode , although i'm going get additional uv filter cover lens because i don't want scratch lens getting too close something . it great possibility past ' auto ' settings , isn't heavy some dslrs would . i find evf ( electronic view finder ) just right brightness ( some said they thought it too dark ) , although evf resolution bit grainy , i know photos themselves coming out fantastic , so it not problem . it my first non ps camera - i got this instead dslrs i looking am very happy my decision . great bang buck	1
this adapter works well natural light settings but doesn't work when using built flash camera . there design flaw causes underexposed pics when using flash . it great add using filters protecting lens otherwise	1
what steal this camera ! just got it mail this week , it proven itself well worth buying . i love pretty much everything it . pictures , even auto mode , crisp detailed . if you like photography side , aperture , shutter , focus settings very comprehensive . i never " real " camera before other than cheap 35mm one , haven't taken any photography classes or learned anything photography . i only read little bit online basics , within 2 days i adjusting settings scene needs wow pictures turned out great . if you interested photography , this definitely camera you . one thing mention , however , sd cards really fast while camera , but once you connect camera pc via usb , pictures take while load order edit ( photoshop ) . i highly recommend fast sd card , like sandisk sd extreme iii . battery life pretty good , even when doing video . videos look sound great , you take pictures while you record video . i looking this camera 2 months finally bought it , it well worth it . if you're fence this or more expensive canon or nikon , i'd go this unless you're super hardcore . 5/5 stars excellent product incredible price .	1
price paid , this great camera . should last me long time . debated buying slr , but this seems all features expensive slr ( actually it slr , just no interchangable lenses ) lot easier use	1
i this printer six months am very pleased results . printer comes " starter pack " print 5 7 pictures so you want get additional paper pack . output excellent - amateur , i cannot discern difference these photos those photo lab . they even " kodak " printed back paper ! i printed 50 pictures so far no snags . this best photo printer i owned ( much more reliable than picturemate epson its " cloggy " print head you touch photo right away without smudging unlike full-size hp photo printer psc-2210 ) . largest picture pack give you prints $0.20 each - not too bad get instant results	1
i am not new digital cameras . this camera , overall , more usable than any digital camera i or . i've owned used camera 7 months may 06 . i owned olympus , sony fuji digital cameras . this camera far , easiest menus navigate easy navigate quickly without reading instructions . back display huge bright , glass reinforced , which lot competitors not . this keeps away scratches smashes . casing real metal , so you not baby it , finally , size shape this camera make it very convenient carry front pocket jeans no problems . this razr digital cameras , my opinion . it ready take pictures very quickly when you open lens cover . rechargable battery never died me before i ran out 1 gb memory card . flash adequate but bit slow recharge . this not problem me however , because i chose this camera two unique features , first -- " natural light mode " -- " flash off " mode enhances pictures natural light . i take most my pictures , even indoors , no flash , because i like look natural light . this camera great capturing under those conditions . second feature i like camera called " photochrome " mode -- it richens colors makes pictures sort " technicolor " look . print worthy many cases . i use this conjunction natural light mode . only drawbacks i could think this camera because screen size/vs megapixel , sometimes you think photo come out clearly looking screen , but if you didn't use flash moved ( which obviously makes pictures blurry ) it show up blurry full size when you download it pc . only reason i rated 4 stars instead 5 because super low light situations fact picture 5 megapixels but you view it lcd tricks you thinking picture captured clearly when you might slight blur full size . this may true all cameras , i don't know . this auto focus camera . you get incredibly clear pictures close ups regular photos , but you let it focus . this not " wail your arms around while dance floor snap pictures " camera . many people detract camera because they want it fixed focus camera situations like described above . tempting because it so portable stylish , but this camera fills needs much more than fixed focus . i 4 megapixel fuji s3100 situations where i need mega zoom , but , who wants lug around camera bag trip mall or walmart or work ? i also own sony dsc-p72 which not bad anything , but isn't great anything either , too big hogs batteries . previously i owned olympus digital cameras . i've found 5 megapixels z1 more than adequate , i often shoot 2 or 3 . i black edition . it show finger prints . if i it again i'd choose silver only reason . i carry this camera often because its so convenient , often those pictures i'd missed only owning larger camera not lugging it captured because how convenient it carry this camera . its no burden all travel , produces great results , battery lasts long , durable .	1
i looking this traditional look photo frame quite long time . i search no more . i found it . i love this unit it very user friendly . pros -- nice frame design clear widescreen . fast slideshow . pictures don't distort like others . internal memory store up 20 hi-res photos . on-screen menu shown buttons . best all : last memory ! cons -- buttons top just few . no cf .	1
frame good deal 10 inch lcd , least when i bought it month ago . pictures look great , slide show i converted mpeg played no problems	1
if you like idea relatively inexpensive , lightweight , compact zoom binoculars , then look no further . i just got my pair nikon travelite zoom ( 8-24 25 cf ) nocs , i already love them . don't let bird watching crowd talk you out getting pair zoom binoculars , folks . when binocular nuts say zoom nocs " don't perform well , " try discourage others buying them , what they really mean most people don't know what expect when they get their hands pair zooms , sometimes unpleasantly surprised find out they don't work exactly like their favorite fixed magnification nocs . all optical tools , zoom nocs best certain kinds uses , not so good others . specifically , bottom end their range , they " see " same any fixed mag nocs same focal dimensions optic quality . however , you increase zoom , three things happen : 1 ) your field view gets smaller ; 2 ) visible light coming through nocs lessens , or , image gets little bit " darker , " 3 ) it becomes more difficult keep nocs fixed your target . now obviously , if you attempting watch something like small bird flight , perhaps even adjust zoom while trying keep nocs focused your subject same time , you very frustrated " performance " these or any zoom binoculars . isn't because nocs aren't doing their job ... it because you're using wrong kind optical tool task hand ! if , other hand , you looking well-lighted subject stationary , or not moving around too much , you just want get little closer look it , you absolutely thrilled what you get these nocs . nikon optics crystal clear first rate modest price . zoom mechanism simple , smooth cool . " zoom " you simply turn zoom ring located right eyepiece clockwise , then back other way " zoom out . " diopter ( that adjuster compensates focal differences right left eyes individual users ) located left eyepiece . nocs solidly constructed , nice " tight " feel all moving parts , black rubber armor covering most exterior , good grip . they're very lightweight , fit your hands like glove , come neck strap , eyepiece caps , custom-fitted , black nylon mesh carrying case belt loop back . finally , if you any difficulty holding nocs steady their maximum magification ( most people ) , fear not ! think getting adjustable monopod rest nocs while you look through them , e.g. , polecat " explorer " stoney point , their optional binocular rest . this monopod adjusted hold your nocs steady you , whether you're standing or sitting . it doubles walking stick , standard screw mount top use cameras , camcorders , etc . i've now gotten used this little " extra " myself , it vastly enhanced my enjoyment nocs , especially higher magnifications . i personally think negative press zoom nocs nonsense . just satisfy yourself zoom nocs ok your intended use(s ) , then learn how use them right way . i took chance bought nikon travelite zoom nocs , sight unseen , i'm glad i . these great compact binoculars price	1

i initially bought digital frame target take it back because picture quality so bad ( not mention bad remote lack functions ) . i got pandigital office depot i am so glad i . pictures bit contrasty but i worked out . video function plus - i thought i wouldn't use- but it worked very well my camera/frame combo . small videos i took my camera never used until now . i love this function ! it also easy load ( copy paste ) my sd card worked straight my camera ( panasonic waterproof digital . i wish you could mix playing video pictures , but then again , you don't want talking customer work all sudden hear video your picture frame . i'll use remote . rotate feature also feature i like which other frame not	1
good product - but price double price generic batteries . they no longer made japan . now they made china . price i would rather made japan . not noticed difference when compared generics . i guess time tell if generics stop holding their charge continued usage . using made japan version 2yrs still holding their charge .	1
daughter great time using it . size makes it easy take it anywhere	1

i lookin big frame without big price , this perfect !! very easy use i bought 256m sd card filled it 130photos just put card , after adjusting brightness i all set , its very simple use , price well worth it !!	1
this not high-tech digital frame . it doesn't play mp3 . it doesn't come remote . it simply reads your digital pictures card displays them slide show mode . there " " button " off " button . there no manual read order learn how operate your frame ( though it come one-page instruction sheet ) . it great your office desk when all you need reach over turn it or off . if you want display it difficul t-t o-reach location , or choreograph your pictures music , then this not frame you	1
very good picture quality . very small easy carry around . mp3 quality good even speakers decent job considering size device . few minor complaints . flash auto mode flashes twice so your unaware subject move after first one ruin photograph . there no problem other modes . beware if you mac . i haven't able figure out how put video thing which not what i really bought it so who cares . mp3 function works fine mac uploading pictures no problem through iphoto . conclusion : great little camera perfect going out decent mp3 ( great value money way ) . video format needs reworked mac but should work well windows	1
i absolutely love this camera ! granted it first digital camera i myself ever owned but i plenty friends cameras . nv3 far best i've ever used . it some extras like mp3 mpeg4 playback may seem unnecessary first but you won't able let it go once you set everything up your liking drop atleast 2gb sd card insane amount storage . battery life great , flash great , picture quality just below slr quality ! i love it , samsung outdone themselves this one	1
i'm very much pleased paperit cheaper than i thought it would . i very urgent paper came right time . ^	1
this great camcorder . it very small , compact , easy run , even looks nice . it actually fits most average size digital camera cases . i've not it all long , but so far i am pleased it . let me just list pros cons ; hopefully it helpful . pros : * 30g hard disk drive massive . * recharges less than 2 hours . * used while pluged ac adapter/charger . * relatively easy use -- self explanatory manual on-screen display . * digital pics better than i expected . * plugs right into tv/vcr/dvd playback/burning/recording . * indoor average light situation acceptable me ; everything shows up fine ( though lower than average light , video gets bit grainy ) . * remote great -- you put camera stand use remote record zoom ( use playback/tv mode ) . cons : * battery only good 60 minutes . * software not very good ; it bogs down my computer not easy use . * light camera only good close up ( though this expected ) . * record button split-second slow when shutting recording off . * view screen cannot bend backwards more than 90 degrees ; it only twists up down . summary , i am happy camera think it worth money . i may some point purchase or find better software edit these movies . they , way , play newest windows media player ( version 11 ? ) . i also plan getting battery back-up .	1
jvc g-series camcorders excellent value . gzmg57 no exception . i bought this my wife she thrilled . she likes point-and-click simplicity , millions features , simple video browsing ( playback ) mode , quality video . some professional reviewers rate jvc lens technology lower than sony , because theory sony lens superior . practice , there no difference . sony touch-screen menus big hassle , too . us , this model perfect mix features cost . it takes wonderful indoor pictures ( well outdoor ) thanks 1.2 lens , built-in light ( unlike gzmg7x models ) , shoots wide-screen ( 16:9 ) , stores 7 hours highest quality video , sdram card ( easy controls transfer / hard drive ) , 15x zoom . it also works our mac pc ( mac , i recommend you just use built-in idvd software instead jvc software ) . sony sc100 much larger hard drive , but that it . that not enough justify $250 price differential , imho .	1
i purchased this cancorder one purpose : playback old 8mm tapes recording onto dvd-r recorder . this purpose it ideal : low cost ; colour view sceen sound ; plays 8mm hi8 tapes ; rugged high quality feel , so it may last long time ; apparently only name-brand 8mm camera available this time . if you looking general purpsose camcorder not buy this one following reasons1 . 8mm hi8 obsolete . when your camcorder finally breaks ( all three mine after average 5 years use ) you hard time finding device playback your precious tapes . 2 . this camcorder no " steady shot " which my experience most important feature easy recording good quality videos . 3 . this camcorder rather big heavy compared many others available . steven woodward	1
i love adapter saving me buy mega expensive cr2 batteries my eos t2 uses . however i thought i could use rechargeable batteries this adapter . most nimh nicad rechargeables 1.2 ( versus alkaline 1.5 ) i am guessing 4 rechargeables only giving 4.8 versus 2 cr2 giving 6 volts ... not enough power camera .	1
purchased camera_world $49 . these authentic canon batteries original packaging . they work great i put them through many cycles . they hold up terrificly	1
these glasses small , protable good concerts quick bird work . i keep set car , but they not replace my larger busnells birding . please don't expect more than little backyard birding these , i am now adjusted my larger set , so i use those yard . you get what you pay	1
what not like ? light , compact comes strap , case wipe cloth . they perfect . keep mind 12 power more challeging hold still	1
these great little binoculars i use quite often . they so compact lightweight i grab them whenever i leave house - whether it boat ride around lake or just quick ride . i don't see quite well when i leave my eyeglasses it take little bit more adjusting get focus right eyeglasses , but they great pair binoculars price . i am very impressed quality them .	1
if you looking camera everything you need transfer movies your computer this not it . it work if you get cable you use software suite such nero ( often comes w/ dvd burners)- but these things don't come camera . size camera great well battery life . biggest problem , important one , we found this camera dark picture- picture bit grainy pixely especially poor performance low lighting . battery life size not good enough sacrifice sharp picture quality bright picture colors .	1
this camera great ! really user friendly takes great quality videos . lcd screen touch screen which makes it simple play back videos work camera . anyone looking small camera thats easy work ... this one !!	1
we purchased this camera video my newborn son , we very pleased . all features it , there no way go wrong . it easily mastered you not need college education order operate it	1
my wife i bought this our optura 2000mc go our honeymoon found this very useful day long excursions . we hardly needed look power bar whole time . also size helpful because it helped balance camera steadier shot . definitley worth getting	1
i bought this camera divers outlet florida city , florida . they 2 them clearance table $39.99 each . i went off dive boat key largo when i dive shop john pennicamp state beach down road i noticed they same camera rental price $25.00 day . i haven't developed film yet , but flash ready after few seconds shots you can't beat price stick . case didn't leak all , although i only dove " christ statue " which only like 25ft down . excellent alternative digital camera if your'e poor white trash like me	1
this why sony hot ! this sexy little ( yes its really small size pack cards ) it takes perfect clear crisp pictures battery life long 320mins perfect vacation , make sure get memory stick it though , because w/o it it only holds 15 pics . this my first digital camera i would definitely buy sony again	1
sony w55 followup successful popular w50 . it very good compact camera , easy carry easy use , reasonably priced - so most people happy it . not much changed w50 , which this case good thing ! one change w55 7 mp camera , rather than w50 6mp . honestly , that not big plus , they haven't made sensor catches light any larger . same ( good ) lenses , same size sensor = same ( good ) pictures , but not better . ( though it might help little features like smart zoom . ) obvious change course colors . don't make too much fun ! there 4 dsc-w series cameras our family , colors would kept my mother-in-law taking my sister camera home her . little personalization good thing . internal memory expanded ( 56mb ) , but i've never used internal memory cameras it , so i'm not sure matters much . it might worth knowing how use backup , dozen or two shots if your card full , or you some other problem . controls , menus interface w55 reasonably easy use . example , w55 easy access various scene modes ( twilight , etc ) , some explanation screen what those mysterious little icons mean ( so you might actually use them , since it tells you what they ! ) . if you're new digital photography , there learning curve . but if you've used other cameras much , especially sonys , you pick this up use many features right away . read short introductory guide comes camera , though ! rechargeable battery should easily last you full day shooting - hundreds shots - no problem . ( little wise turning it off when you're not using it ! ) so you probably don't need second battery , unless you're going into woods while . it nice not mess bulky aa rechargeables . also , lithium ion batteries don't memory effect , so don't worry partial recharging . just charge battery each night . so - before getting second battery , try it while see if you need it . but get case - something protect screen , least . fully closed one might help resist rain splashes little , too . you'll also want get memory stick pro duo card - pro cards faster , you need smaller duo size this camera . get 1-2gb card so you don't think running out memory too much - if you shop carefully , you find them so little these days it well worth avoiding running out memory . you might want spare card if you plan travel more than week , or use video mode often - which surprisingly good ( though bit dark ) if set fine , but uses enormous amounts storage setting . you stretch your memory , your hard drive space , using one lower-resolution settings take snapshots . you don't really need 7mp all your photos ! w55 take better photos than those credit-card type cameras tiny lens system - optics always make difference camera . any reasonable person very happy pictures w55 , given size it . camera little slow often take disappointing pictures low light dark situations . try high iso mode low light no-flash situations - picture quality suffers some , but most people find it useful . realistically , no ultra-compact camera work really well situation - if you need often , think something bigger lens bigger sensor . good light always gives best pictures any camera . there limits what you currently expect any ultracompact camera . w55 offers enough controls ( through scene modes program mode ) allow fair amount control over pictures , automatic camera . charger fairly compact rated 100-240v , so while you'll need plug adapter overseas you won't need voltage converter . battery charger little slow , though probably ok . keep this camera charged handy , you'll find you take lot pictures because it easy carry easy use	1
i lot olympus manual focus lenses my old om-4t . i like use these , but e-volt 500 poor viewfinder manual focusing . as-me-1 just enough help . it not perfect - constricts field view more than i would like - but it makes manual focusing doable reasonable me . this doesn't magnify smallish viewfinder very much but it makes manual focus reasonable option . oh yeah , it much more comfortable against my eye than default eyecup .	1
ok - read all 7 reviews ( thank you other 7 opening my eyes ) i decided plunk down dough buy one . i wasn't able understand why people so diametrically opposed this simple accessory - it always either god gift cameras or useless day long . it arrived today ups ( thanks amazon prime - next day service!)here what i tell . i've olympus user since 2500 days - after 2500 i graduated e20n - similar viewfinder - nice big image , easy use . i avoided e-1 , content my e20n wondering what 4/3 system would bring revolutionize cameras or become standard . now i've moved evolt 300 - day one , my biggest complaint " viewfinder too small " - still my e20n i compared them - sure enough 300 smaller than e20n . what going here ? i bought my as-me-1 it clicked easier than rubber cup . bam suddenly my view big again - like e20n ! i see again . i seeeee again ! ( little miami vice music here ) if you tweek focus , it big deal . my personal theory ( i am wrong well right ) it depends if you use prescription glasses . or maybe other prescriptions . eye entrance pupil . as-me-1 guides light focus grid through pupil . i personally like shoot my glasses . camera up , halfway push , fully push if happy , camera down . my friends remove their glasses , their mouth they go , up eye goes rubber cup - they shoot shoot shoot . they don't seem bothered e300 . if you nearsighted your glasses make things look smaller than they actually ( ask old ben franklin who invented eyeglasses ) - as-me-1 counters this effect prescription lenses . if you remove your glasses or 20/20 vision , well , you may like bigger image , but it not likely big deal it me . i'm happy - 5 stars all - it winner . i fully respect people who given it one star . they made me search reason . i think eyeball vision glasses key this product benefit or hindrance shooter . yes , its 20% larger ( 1/5 ) - me that big deal . given price potential performance ratio , it winner good chunk population who doesn't remove their eyeglasses snap picture those 20/20 shoot nightime or dimly lit studio large entrance pupil likely not benefit . human sensory perception threshold noticability 10% meaning if one cup water 10% hotter than it felt hotter , but less than 10% it likely feel same temperature , same goes shades grey , almost any perception . it called 10% rule . 20% increase picture size , as-me-1 pretty much guaranteed noticed human physiology , final reason i bought it . lets hope your experiences good ones - i didn't say you'd like it - just notice it ! ( optics however top notch )	1
this great digital camera . i no problems it . i got it my 1st anniversary 2 yrs ago . its great ! you take pictures , put xmas , valentines or birthday borders around them b4 you take picture . it video too , you play back video , but there no sound because there no speaker camera , there mic thuigh . so when you download video , it play sound too . camera survivied dropped many times . i would like take long videos , so i am going purchase 4gb sd card . i feel sorry all people i saw complaining camera because i no problems 2 years now . only thing batteries die quickly ( using flash really drains battery ) , so i went bought high quality rechargable batteries , or disposable duracell meant digital cameras . also people who complained blurry pictures , it depends what setting you camera . i not like all those different setings , they just mess up pic . not use auto feature i always use non auto , egulr pic , flash . all those other settings confusing . oh yes great self timer when you noone hold camera	1
great size shape taking places . feels good your hand . boots up pretty quick . like color . impressed features . takes decent pictures . internal memory , well taking memory card . i suggest getting set good rechargable batteries .	1
i absolutely love this dvd camcorder . it so super small user friendly i can't explain . it very simple use . my only complaint frustration my sony vgc-ra710g vaio pc usb software sony dcr-dvd7 don't get . i thought sure sony would compatible sony , especially since both less than one year old . best i tell windows xp professional won't recognize usb connection camcorder because software isn't digitally signed or something . plus everytime i try just any installation variation my pc gets hung up ... something it never ever ever . so until sony answer why sony won't talk sony i can't give product 5 stars . this camcorder hook up easily tv , once you finalize your recordings , they play anything . i can't comment editing software because i only trying hook up camcorder pc via usb cable . my hopes assumptions i use software my finalized dvd . p.s. if any other users experiencing this same problem or offer any advice , it would greatly appreciated	1
works very well little instruction . camera grainy low light , crisp daylight . video crisp , audio good . easy touch screen application makes this camcorder delight use	1
i purchased this together 4 section monopod . this head very solid , works very smooth . i would definitely recommend this if you planning use it slr . i you smaller point shoot , you might want stay away . before my current rebel xti , i used this powershot s3 , quick release lever would stick into palm my hand . very uncomfortable distracting when you're trying compose	1
very well made looks like it hold up very long time ! i'm not professional photographer , far it , but i don't think you go wrong this if you dslr without huge telephoto lens support . i olympus e-500 system it great this	1
i've used this two different monopods , light-weight manfrotto monopod i use when i'm travelling , heavy-duty pro-grade manfrotto i use home . this head works wonderfully exactly what you'd expect company reputation bogen	1
i purchased this lens my fuji s5100 order take wide angle pictures rooms our house . this lens works well areas plenty light but if you need use camera flash then you may issues this unit . you may require additional flash slave unit or 2 properly light your subject which takes you whole new level photography . it seems built flash flips up too low blocked this lens . other then this , this lens puts out quality pictures attaches easily lens adaptor came s5100	1
five stars , even though image quality siffers tiny bit . $30 , what one expect ? easy installation use ( just screw it into filter theads lens , then shoot ) . built-in macro adapter further simplifies shooting . all all , good purchase decision	1
i some gift cards so i went buy my first digital camera . i went local electronics store i certain financial cap . i wasn't thrilled my choices but this camera caught my eye i just fell love it . i spend more than i planned but it 100% worth it . camera very easy hold , its not too small , its not too big . it fits easily into my purse . pictures beautiful , battery life great i yet exceed amount pictures i store . i over 300 now extended battery . only gripe i reset time every time i put battery back . its minor inconvenience . screen back larger than lot them out now . major deciding factor .. good zoom . it very nice silver color too . my first digital camera , this perfect choice .	1
i've extensive studying find good camera within my price range , this one it . months later , i no regrets whatsoever . i seen slightly newer moder , z760 , i honestly think this one better deal . z760 one more megapixel , but doesn't matter me . i zoom far photoshop go see differance , there really isn't much one . this odel superior zoom , which why i picked i t.t his one also automatic lens-cover , whereas z760 many other high zoom cameras lens covers you put yourself , which also easier get lost . this one doesn't all mickey-mouse options like fancy frames , but it alternations fit my needs . it b+w , sepia tone , well options low , natural , or high color , other options like light balance . i found out i don't like presets , but that just like me . i prefer use manual settings , which much easier access than most other cameras i've used . if i think couple bad sides , i'd say it image size need take battery out charge it . this camera only 8x10 shots , which isn't very useful if you intend more professional work . battery recharged taking it out putting charger , however this problem solved simply getting dock it . also , like most other cameras , this one isn't very smooth my computer . software little bit confusing , but this no problem either long you sd card reader	1
these batteries great batteries following characteristics : 2 123-size lithium batteries use photographic devices , also works certain calculators , pagers , watches , more . these batteries storage life up ten years . reliable high low temperature	1
we bought this charger long after we our camcorder . it wasn't until we purchased extra battery camera works off same battery we realized charging batteries off-camera better practise since camera/camcorder sometimes get unusually warm after charging . besides battery charge home/hotel while road stand-by secure feeling . device itself very compact sturdy color coded leds let you know when charging completed . it fits easily ( including little power supply box ) into camera/camcorder bag guaranteed travel companion .	1
excellent so far ; however , it not include usb cable computer . my only complaint so far ........	1
so far so good . used iit only few times . like feature still shots .	1
extremely impressed tz3 . this gem should get 5 stars construction finish alone . just holding it your hands it screams quality feels like tank . love it . it seriously feels like $700 camera . no exaggeration . i little worried it not able fit my jean pockets before buying it . women may issues really tight jeans but us guys no problem . it fits fine . i seriously cant believe i carry around camera 10x zoom inside my jean pockets . truly remarkable . 3 " screen amazing . you practically enjoy your pics right screen w/o even printing them high res output . navigation so easy this camera . something not surprising though if your already coming panny ( fz7 here ) . picture quality great . i tested it out today standard i would say its just good my fz7 daylight better lowlight ( indoors ) . image quality great , if you need extra sharpness you could always use camera " vivid mode " or add little some post processing . pics standard natural mode pp very well . wide angle something new me . took some neat shots looked very nice extra viewing angle . very distinctive after this i'm not sure if i could go back . if your looking it all camera this may very well your tool choice . combine it extreme versatility coupled excellent image quality , superb lens , build , finish you yourself winner .	1
i owned first generation dmc-tz1 . dmc-tz3 some welcome improvements ; wider angle , automatic lens cover , maybe 25% faster sho t-t o-shot . particular , wider angle really useful feature . camera strength its versatile , outdoor shooting . it best lots light . indoors , flash coverage just ok . sho t-t o-shot flash recycle time sometimes pokey 4 seconds . digital picture noise noticeable lesser light . setup tips : 1 . use 3x2 ratio if you primarily print 6x4 photos . 2 . use vivid mode normal mode looks washed out .	1
i bought my mother 7 " digital picture frame pandigital christmas . after using it couple days , my brother i both agreed it wasn't good product my mother . remote control didn't work well interface usb port wasn't working . so we returned product linens things it orginally purchased . month went my mother missed frame . she like able easily pop out memory chip her digital camera plug it into digital picture frame . so i went line found matsunichi photo frame . i never heard this brand before somewhat concerned quality it products . however reviews other people rated this pretty good price . i also upsized 8 " due all reviews i read it better aspect ratio digital pictures coming directly off camera memory ( i.e. , without resize ) . ease use simple use key my mother who not technical wiz ( not take time read manual ) . this frame very good value - price reasonable , picture quality very good easy use . frame good construction not cheap looking . i also read reviews other frames , but found several them very expensive ranging $150 some over $300 . i paid $139 this frame . don't understand why someone would pay $300 this size frame . i would buy this company again . my mom thrilled her new frame	1
pros : + cherry ( or mahogany ) frame + fine resolution - great color + good sound considering small speakers back mounted + several slideshow transition timing options + photos , music videos well + remote very basic ( simple)cons : - user interface tricky use screen menus first - remote could benefit pause buttoni got this unit myself but idea i'll get one my parents if it works out . my concerns ease use image quality , large picture size price . this unit attractive , displays nicely easy operate . all my parents need plug memory cards i send them turn it . all this under 200 bucks . they sure pack alot features into small package .	1
disagree previous poster - vialta vistaframe superb . i haven't seen any pixelation my pix . i keep frame my desk work it much admired . i love it pieces . my only complaint its price , when they eventually come down price i'll get one home use . also power-saving shutoff only kicks after 2 hours which i think too long . reasons i bought this one over others : * card compatibility * it stand-alone , no need upload/download pix via computer * size its screen * classic metal frame itself - doesn't detract pix , indeed when it you don't see frame . agree randomizer screenshow would good , also would nice able specify how long pics screen . only thing stopping me buying myself or gifts family price . love it	1
after working 35mm cameras such most " series " nikons , other formats , i searching digital camera would give me same results maybe surpass because digital capabilities . well , after spending quite bit money purchasing some digitals , i never felt " wow effect " until i came across this beauty . first , i most smart consumers researched well read reviews . reviews specs good enough purchase this model above all others including other panasonics . this camera takes amazing shots , still allows you manually change settings if you choose so . plus this inserting high capacity memory card , you shoot video scene length mem card . course this not take place quality camcorder , nor you adjust any settings once you video mode such zoom , but feature alone plus quality awesome . this past summer we took this camera vacation us shot beautiful sunsets great video our son surfing . i dozens cd incredible video footage even birth our first grandson . i recommend this camera 100% , it still less than $300 . if you shop around . if you want quality digital 35mm feel then go it ! one more very important thing , accessories very expensive if you buy them panasonic . this beauty hot shoe extra flash now here kicker , i decided see if my vivitar 283 flash would work camera yes it . matter fact all my flashes work , but course they should used extreme cases because built flash great . matter fact , i've only use it once night shot results awesome this camera .	1
i bought ( returned ) 2 other cameras before this one . they kodak z612 canon powershot s2 . this one far best . image stabilization incredible , colors natural . i am very pleased it	1
its sleek easy use . it takes great pictures alot feature	1
noticeable difference when used , i live smoggy vegas ! so i tell , can't beat price , i give it two thumbs up	1
my wife purchased one these frames her desk work year ago . she liked it so much we bought one our daughter who just new baby .	1
i bought this picture frame my dad christmas . i thought it would great gift because he somewhat home bound he alot pictures . i used sd card slot put pictures they display really great . he some black white pictures some pictues color they both look clear sharp bright . he pretty excited see what frame could wants even more his pictures scanned put display . it always gratifying your gift appreciated ... this one certainly	1
i purchased dsc-s90 4.1 camera myself christmas best buy because i $70 certificates them . carl zeis lens great it takes beautiful pictures up 8x10 11x14 good . it so many features battery life great . it came charger two sony batteries , but i use regular duracell alkaline batteries fill up memory stick ( 256k ) without changing them . big improvement over old one i . i used it hawaii found video good well it also records voice . person who problem batteries memory stick same compartment , just turn camera upside down remove memory stick your batteries won't fall out . i would recommend camera plan buy my son . buy your memory sticks amazon.com price good . i paid $30 + my 256 memory pro rate i take pictures equivilent four 4packs 400asa film . not so bad when you think it way .	1
i just got this camera christmas . i hate reading directions , so i popped battery memory card i off ! very user friendly , all right options . plus , its size average cell phone . coolest thing powershot it knows which way you're holding camera , so if you hold it vertical get tall shot , viewer turns all itself . i also love you edit video camera set up slide shows . its very easy load pics onto my computer usb connection - or set up slide show tv . it even holds voice memos cute sound effects when i take pictures . this really great camera	1
gave this in-laws cristmas they taking pictures next time we went visit . definitely buy additional memory , internal memory really more back-up	1
my husband got this me present i love it . easy use .	1
this simple flash just fills need somebody who wants better results than built-in flash nikon dslr camera without extra complexity . it what it , quite well . only controls unit itself on/off switch bounce angle . camera ittl function work , i no complaints results . just perfect solution get softer , more diffused lighting indoor photography allowing you bounce light rather than direct illumination . body quite compact , when mounted my d80 body not throw off balance my hands . it even compact enough fit inside some camera cases while still attached body . it also versatile you improvise bounce-diffuser low-cost . just cut piece 4x6 inkjet photo print paper same width flash , fold it " " shape mount it flash rubber band above just behind strobe . when flash pointed up bounce , some light gets reflected forward paper behind light fills subject little better . same $40+ aftermarket reflector/diffusers . sb-400 no means same job sb-800 , because flash made give more options professional more demanding situations . but somebody wanting flash simple indoor photography ( perhaps not large public hall ) where there desire bounce flash better photos , or shoot little bit longer range , this job not great deal money . it would better if light could swivel well angled upward more bounce options . if that important you , then sb-600 or sb-800 might right choice	1
although , my nikon d50 built flash but i got this any way . this help me taking indoor shots low light environment . if you afford it , get it . feature i most like it flsh angle . cons : takes aa battery . i would prefer chargeble option camera	1
its small works well , slightly better than built . nothing amazing but seems integrate nicely exposure/flash functio	1
good camera ! back all screen which great . good settings , good zoom , good quality . definitely recommend !	1
i also bought 512mb memory card it taking me forever use it up . i love how easy this camera use . my 4 year old neice figured it out . very user friendly . i would highly recommend this anyone . great quality pictures super long battery time	1
i got red one ! waited month or so this camera finally become available i love it . i also wanted camera i could put my pocket go ..... 35 mm digital camera .... found it too big lug around . am going cruise ( 17 days counting ! ) wanted compact camera . this camera unbelievable .... easy use , great pictures fun ! members my family taken it out my hand able immediately start using it . got some great pics 3 grandkids ... blew one up 8x10 ... beautiful picture . i too now carry my camera me all time gotten lot impromptu pictures ! battery life great ... also bought back up so not without while cruise . 2 mg high speed pro duo card .... not come close running out room ( i download periodically ! ) . if you looking compact camera easy use takes geat pictues ( good battery - my first digital camera ate batteries ... so this important me ! ) .... i highly recommend sony t100 - go red ... it cool !! oh ... love large screen too	1
this 4th sony camera i've each time they keep getting better ( which why i've bought 4 ) . this newest one , i got red , best looking camera i've seen ( everyone agrees ) . however , i few qualms it my first uses . 1st they got rid review button left hand side t-pad instead copied all other camera makers added view button top . while this works ok , i really miss able quickly go back last picture i took push delete button then take , it not huge deal , but it just takes more time . 2nd screen quality not nearly good other sony i've past . while it giant which nice , pixels fairly large i feel this lack resolution makes pictures look worse than they when they get computer . new face detection feature pretty neat , though i haven't really able tell what difference it makes . also i little upset high iso setting , i tried using it club not only it so dark picture useless , but it also soo grainy blurry nothing could identified . i'll experiment it more , but so far it bit let down . steady shot works pretty well , i've only slight blur one photo ( which expected hand got bumped ) all others perfect which quite welcome after my last camera without steadyshot blurred frequently . big disappointment me they got rid infolithium battery , i don't know if this because issues they've , or just because this one lasted longer or what , but it annoying not it say how many minutes i left i've gotten used it past 3 cameras them . still it not big deal , just kind annoying they got rid feature . 5x zoom very good , welcome over measly 3x older versions . size weight really good ( although it could bit slimmer it still almost inch thick ) . still it smaller than my wallet thick my cell phone , so i can't really complain . all all it great purchase so far i'm quite pleased , still sticking sony future this camera so much better than my friends ' casios canons	1
soon you charge battery first time , you take picture . quick start guide all information you need perform all common tasks camera . you use camera simple point shoot , or take advantage all its features . you snap pictures less than 2 seconds apart . great clarity until you reduce megapixels too much digital zoom , but camera tells you what your current mp level , so you monitor quality before you snap . i recommend extra battery card plenty extra memory so you snap unlimited photos then pick choose later . only drawback latch battery/memory door requires some dexterity open close . if you clumsy fingers , you'll want try open latch demo before you buy it . also read my comment scott rose review	1
this camera good any one travels wants good pixs family or places they visit . viewing area good size those " over 50 eyes " easier see when sun shinging than most . lcd blurry until pushing button which only negative i find . i expensive sony but this less bulky easier take plane . slips my purse	1
i purchased this camera replace olympus 400 . all all , it takes great pictures . image stabilization works very well . i took some test shots dawn freeway bridge ( low light conditions bouncing traffic)and camera performed excellently . shots turned out great . good color saturation , fairly sharp image . it also weather resistant 400 , which one major reasons i picked olympus . i camera " fry " because little rain during picture shoot . it seem go through battery power quicker than i would like , especially if it used outdoors cold . but i planned ahead buying two extra batteries just issue . lack optical viewfinder , screen use all time , i suspect major culprit . i usually turned off screen my older camera conserve battery life . many postings this most newer point shoot cameras , lack optical viewer critical flaw if shooting bright environments . reflected glare , dim screen images , you just can't see thing while composing your shot . just point , shoot , hope ! i looking digital slr next camera when i bought this camera . i'm not sure i'm through looking	1
i not used camera much , but like other stylus models i own ; it quite functional . i miss viewfinder because bright light make digital display little iffy . 5x optical zoom very nice . pocket size camera makes it extremely worthwhile me	1
small , good picture quality , rugged ... i've taken this camera camping , canoing , hiking , biking , etc . it covered scratches , it rain , yet it still takes great pictures . it fits pocket or backpack without any problem . i'd highly recommend this camera	1
after i lost my previous digital camera 3 foot fall , i looking digital camera could survive thrown around bit , also something i could take kayaking . optio 33wr seemed tailor-made my needs . first weekend i it i went hiking one dustier trails northern california , i came back some great shots banana slugs , redwoods hilly panoramas . camera didn't handle bright sunlight well i hoped ( some my panarama pictures bit washed out ) . however , you knock exposure down half steps manually ( which i came use frequently later ) . next day i tentatively dipped it under running sink , dried it off , waited it explode . happily it behaved though nothing happened . eventually , i took it kayaking , all day , salt water . it handled splash , salt , sun like champ . added bonus , batteries ( not default ones , but some fairly standard rechargeables i'd purchased seperately ) managed last whole trip ( 120 shots 4 hours water ) . i also got use phrase : " hang minute , i rinse off my camera " - there something cool saying . most recently camera survived 4 weeks backpacking , much which spent plains kenya . obviously , there not enough zoom make this " safari " camera , but it great capturing some spontaneous moments , some landscape shots braver wildlife . i found it hard get good picture lower light situations ( dusk or dawn ) . but anytime there some cloud cover during day pictures deep rich . quality photos quite what i'd expect 3mp camera . manual focus nice bonus , but autofocus responsive enough . zoom less then i would like , but still acceptable . digital camera features alone , i'd say this camera easy 3.5 or maybe 4 stars . freedom take it out water , get dirty generally abuse it push it up shining 5 stars	1
this summer i travel palestine attend wedding . last thing i wanted hall around ostentatious camera would break my back well problem check points border crossings . i picked sanyo xacti c6 . it great . size amazing , its big my cell phone , i laughed first becasue i didn't find it when i opend box . video quality great , ** it size ** i expecting picture realy blurry pixulated but it wasn't bad , more suprizing indoor videos night . however , still picture capabilities inferior movie capabilities . don't even think taking picture night . my trip camera fulfilled its duties flying colors . but then my family used it film highschool graduation ... boy disaster . movies wedding weren't very celebrated , but behind scenes great . again don't use it family moments ! now you might say why should i buy flawed camera price , its because you use it maybe 1000x more often than regular bulky video camera . many times i capture great vacation moments this camera situations where bulky camera wouldn't carried , just because this one placed pocket your pants	1
like many people , i debated debated , read countless reviews , watched prices weeks ... me , it pretty much came down e500 8mp rebel . ( 6mp pentax d100 running , too . ) finally , i pretty much decided based reviews e500 , it seemed like people who know their way around slr cameras enjoyed it , whereas complaints mostly seemed lack ease those coming ps camp . said , olympus make fine cameras . so canon . so nikon . i saw it , it pretty much like old ford verus chevy debate : just many people tell you why one superior other . when it comes down it , all cameras ( like all cars ) their stong points their weak points . depending what you're using camera , different aspects weigh more heavily than others . instance , me , price big concern . this , hands down , best deal . i picked up factory demo refurbished 2-lens kit . i don't think i list price review , but it cheapest among 8mp cameras . two lenses both made-for-digital . somewhat limited olympus ' 4/3 platform , but any camera you buy if you want good glass front it , you'll spending much body . or more . top line lenses not cheap ... anywhere , any maker . these zuiko lenses seem solid though , i can't complain them . i wish there more af options versus what basically amounts center-focus option only . there 3 , but they're very close center . minor irritation , though ; just focus your subject , hold shutter down halfway , then frame your shot . really no different than lining up those two circles older 35mm lenses . i like overall ergonomics camera . it just big enough it some heft , but not too heavy weigh you down . ( granted , i'm 6'1 " guy average-sized hands . ) however , it feel little plasticy , but coming pentax k-1000 , i think anything . worked photography-based company recent past , i got little spoiled nikon d1 series ; however , d50 ( lesser extent d70 ) felt more like toy . but e500 fits my hands nicely . i actually really like way lens sits almost all way over one side , ample grip opposite . makes strong handling vertical shots , even one-handed . photos great . very sharp , very crisp . colors nice vibrancy . tones balanced . i've seen few complaints noise higher isos , but i didn't see anything too out line . plus , there noise reduction , which takes it down pretty much nil . anything that left , nothing basic photo-editing program can't take care second . i think " blur " complaints people used ps photography . i've shot down 1/15 or so no more blur than expected . it just matter knowing how hold camera maintain firm stance . someone who loves black-and-white shooting , color filters momochrome mode nice touch . they really make images pop . i've happy all settings ; it lots scene modes , lots little ways tweak images you shoot , too ( high key/low key , vivid , muted , etc ) . flash sits up little higher than other cameras , too , so there less chance catching shadow closer shots . flash little bright slightly distracting when auto-focus focus-finding ( pre-flash ) . again , though , not huge deal . now menu little convoluted . it could more user-friendly intuitive . but it nothing reasonably adept photographer can't figure out after reading manual playing around little bit . second command wheel would nice , but hey , you're here economical camera , you're going cut few corners , i guess . all commands second wheel there , just back menu . some way set " hot buttons " or something could compensate some , too , but again ... think value . my only other " complaint , " which more just minor annoyance than anything , location power swith rear dial adjusting aperture and/or shutter speed . sometimes when changing settings , i'll trip power turn it off . startup quick , though , so it not biggie . sometime when repositioning myself moving camera around , i'll inadvertently change aperture or shutter ( depending which mode i'm shooting ) . either moving it more top , making it harder turn , or making some sort setting " lock " would help . anyway , bottom line : if you're 35mm slr user wanting make switch digital , price deciding factor , just go ahead get this camera . it solid camera takes great pictures , likely just good any other -- more expensive -- options . if you're impatient just want better point-and-shoot , get point shoot . if you're fancy-schmancy professional , why you looking this budget camera ? ;	1
product satisfactory - you would not expect any less olympus . shipping associated wait ? story ! i chose free shipping ( kick , kick ! ) thought product would reach me 5 9 days . no - it would " ship " 5 9 days wherever it . so , next 9 business days , i watched my order - product sat warehouse . i tempted cancel get it via overnight shipping couple times - or try prime shipping one-off thing - but would not fair , right ? painstakingly , product moved came tantalizingly close - 15 miles where i live - sat ups warehouse 2 more days . last time ups supposed deliver , it just noted " premises closed " - when i home waiting package all through 8 hour window - around 2 pm day delivery , i started getting feeling ups would find lock dangling my place . ultimately , it not turn out case . overall , it took more than 12 days travel 100 miles or so . rub it , battery took hours hours charge - it takes 8 10 hours charge fully . so , if you hurry , not order free shipping add 10 hours ups window estimate time you would first use camera . results camera - excellent . i prefer use xd card order avoid bulk number pins ( go out alignment - see post this trail ) cf card . xd card , my experience , extremely stable used one 3+ years . also , if you rm-1 older oly , you use remote here well ! reason i deducted 1 star .. my patience ran thin sh process	1
i amateur photographer 20+ years . time i semi-loyal olympus fan . ( i admit i cheated canon couple point shoots ) . this great dslr someone looking carry their photography hobby digital world or someone looking start new hobby . it not easiest camera use . meaning you need read manual learn icons . picture quality amazing . ability manipulate picture without entering full manual mode also very impressive . size perfect . cannon dslr little compact my hand provide stable platform when shooting . olympus fits just right . ( my hands not huge . ) downside : accessories very expensive limited . kit included excellent satiate appetite most amateur photogs , especially when purchased optional starter kit camera ( extra battery , bag , remote , etc . ) but , before you buy this camera , imagine yourself wanting wide angle lens , or more powerful telephoto . now take look online ... not too impressive ? this area cannon dslr excels	1
bought this go pink camera i bought my 12 yr old daughter xmas . nicely made , protects camera it looks cute !	1
i can't say whether this camera better or worst than f30 , but i say camera excellent . i've using casio ex-z750 last 18 months , it tremendous outdoor performer . it also more compact , viewfinder manual mode . that where advantages end . indoor shots always required flash , flash invariable gave skin strongly unnatural pallor . contrast , f31fd indoor shots without flash superb . i recently took over 200 shots seminar where i could not use flash . skin tones very natural/accurate noise iso 400 or less virtually non-existent . iso800 , noise noticeable , but shots usable . shots iso 1600 also usable , but substantial detail lost . fd worked , but subject looking your direction . also , longest zoom , camera would default iso 1600 auto mode . i found if i zoomed halfway , i could keep iso down 400 ( preferred ) or lower . images little soft , which okay , but might problem if you don't want use photoshop or similar . i haven't taken many outdoor shots . that not why i purchased camera . however , i suspect it fine . most cameras . some dislikes : i wish it viewfinder , i wish it smaller , i wish i could use fd non-automatic mode ( or least prevent iso creeping over 400 ! ) . these not major dislikes . i'm more than happy trade off these minor niggles great performance	1
adapter worked just fine , but one small fault it blocks flash . it just something i failed take into account	1
i received this battery camera thought silly little thing would not last any longer aa , but i suprized . i took 200 pictures it before it finally died half those flash . after it sat my desk almost year . resort aa last night went through 6 aa batteries 40 pictures . so i am going get more becuase it works out cheaper it less hassle .	1
there numerous complaints supplemental image this product amazon website . however , vendors ( such adorama ) send correct item . lastly , this battery far outperforms regular aa batteries , especially if you flash-happy	1
excellent set binoculars -- exquisitely stable details , easy use . my wife never liked use binoculars , but she thinks these great .	1
we live edge bay fair amount bird boat watching . we've using binoculars five months now find them great purpose . we use them constantly feature takes annoying flutter away . we would like get pair car . can't recommend them highly enough	1
this cam since last april 2006 i put some microphone foam over microphones which eliminated any wind noise didnt change exsiiting quailty stereo recording . wind noise filter wasnt enough cut out all wind noise . camera amazing considering its size best part it slipped my front pants pocket goes unnoticed there when you need it ! low light video recording grainy when yuo set asa 400 but so 35mm slrs when using 400 speed film few years back get same feeling this cam . low light auto focusing touch go just give cam time focus or manully set focus . awesome closeup pics both still video mode get down 1/2 " away subject so close lens produce shadow image . i always shoot 5meg size get 700 some pics 2gb card i 4 those weekend events . this price small size i am 100% sold this cam but i use shoot 35mm slr 2-3 lens etc camera bag over shoulder now just this tiny cam my pocket i get both still hd video really amazing . you get better hd still pics but not anything fits front pants pocket !	1
just got camera what i've seen so far it wonderful piece equipment . my only complaint amazon misrepresented battery type saying it , " powered en-el3a or en-el3 " which not true disappointing anyone who upgrading camera use those batteries ( ie d70 ) d200 uses en-el3e which doesn't same fit en-el3a or en-el3 . aware this if you upgrading	1
i waiting affordable nikon digital slr which i could use my older nikon lenses ( ai , series , etc . ) . i know , i could spent thousands d2 , but would overkill me . suffice say , d200 joy use . it fast , solid , intuitive . those owners nikon film slrs who considering d200 , me it " feels " just like nikon film slr . i previously owned several high-end digital point shoot cameras , d200 blows them away terms its capabilities , degree control it offers , resulting quality pictures you take it . it all features advanced amateur photographer could possibly want . i'll probably never even scratch surface all its features , but its nice know they're there if i want or need them . i highly recommend d200 anyone who , like me , waiting right digital slr come	1
i bought this camera after dpreview told me it ( well , actually , its leica sibling ) fits all my needs , namely : compact , raw , aperture priority , plus optical stabilization . what i like : large screen , raw , fairly decent flashwhat i dislike : it actually takes raw + jpeg which wastes space my card . however , it gives me interesting comparison . 90% time , i prefer raw version , albeit tweaked . jpeg colors just don't look right me . i'm also unimpressed image stabilization , warranty just terrible . 90 days ??? what ? also , manual focus without viewfinder takes getting used . i won't argue there noise higher isos , but it not nearly bad i expected other reviews . i haven't decided yet whether i'm keeping camera ; if you're not hurry , hold off see if they release new version summer . course , their track record , they won't fix any problems , just squeeze few more mp out chip	1
i've this camera month . i currently own nikon d50 2 year old canon powershot . i needed something small handy use walk around camera . i've reading reviews months various digital cameras , poured through thousands images posted flickr , i decided this camera . i loved look , size , price , leica lens . images sharper colors more vibrant than my nikon d50 my canon powershot . i love manual settings available this camera . i mostly use setting . although adjusting shutter speed aperture awkward using joystick , menu very simple offers lot control . i also like fact people stop me street whenever i use my camera	1
fantastic camera ! nikon legend lives ! great bright screen , great pictures , video , so much more . amazon cheapest price anywhere	1
i like my new panasonic recorder ( you might consider next model up before you buy ) . what i would really like review performance amazon . first unit i bought performed marginally , so first chance i got i exchanged it amazon . they took care problem , replacing it new camera . they moved problem so fast my jaw dropped . i could not believe how quickly professionally amazon took care situation ! i am old enough little reluctant use internet , but amazon gives me confidence know if its not right , it , quickly ! thanks amazon	1
when you die go heaven , if you where kind hearted photographer great eye , st peter gives you nikon d200 this 18-200mm vr zoom . get most out this lens user needs carefully learn its digital features part nikon d200 system . this lens much more zoom composition aid . it worth attending car , boat or horse race just play image stabilization ( vr ) capabilities . if you born rich or worked way too hard your life just buy one !!	1
i've this lens month now what wonder it . i've out photography 30 years but am still beginner . i read lot this purchase internet it overwhelmingly positive . it pays research . i am selling my nikon 55-200mm but keeping my kit 18-55mm backup . i also love my d40 . probably pick up 50mm 1.8 indoor . highly rated also .	1
overall , very nice product price . i would liked lights bit more powerful	1
i actually less powerful binocular than this one , but it bushnell permafocus technology . i can't even begin describe how amazing it never focus your binoculars . you just look through , whatever you're looking , regardless distance ( except very close-up ) , focus ! it like camera auto-zoom . my husband wears glasses rather strong prescription , he see perfectly clearly through these binoculars without his glasses . he just takes them off , it if he never wears them	1
these glasses small , protable good concerts quick bird work . i keep set car , but they not replace my larger busnells birding . please don't expect more than little backyard birding these , i am now adjusted my larger set , so i use those yard . you get what you pay	1
what not like ? light , compact comes strap , case wipe cloth . they perfect . keep mind 12 power more challeging hold still	1
these great little binoculars i use quite often . they so compact lightweight i grab them whenever i leave house - whether it boat ride around lake or just quick ride . i don't see quite well when i leave my eyeglasses it take little bit more adjusting get focus right eyeglasses , but they great pair binoculars price . i am very impressed quality them .	1
this my first telescope i am very satisfied my purchase . portability ease use high points - you set it top car trunk start using it seconds . gives clear bright views deep sky objects such nebulas clusters . it not best option however watching planets its short focal lenght requires high power eyepieces high magnification you pay this field view eyepiece relief - other words if you want see planets up close , your field view narrow you keep your eye real close eyepiece ( plus you need buy additional eyepieces ) . sum , excellent option amateur use . if this your first time well , get good guidebook ( " nightwatch " dickinson very good pick ) also pair binoculars help you find your way around sky - this piece advice first timers tend not heed then realize how hard it find objects relatively narrow field view their telescope offer	1

nikon d200 amazing camera . this review amazon packing procedures . this review alert prospective buyers amazon not pack these cameras well . i just purchased one it came packed like book , very little padding . i called nikon their recommendation return item pronto . i returned camera ( much trepidation)and purchase trusted source . just wanted give you all heads up	1
my first professional digital slr nikon d1x . i got great pictures it but it too large heavy lug around extended periods . i also some issues its operation . but now , nikon seems solved my issues d200 . i purchased dedicated sb-800 flash 18-200 lens recommended d200 manual . whole system much improved over my other digital slr . both focus metering seem work more reliably . it works better available light . optical anti-vibration aids overall picture sharpness ( plus those us who not rock-steady ) . i am getting use button sequence required enlarge picture preview really like amount magnification possible . menuing system seems quite extensive well-organized . i would like more latitude picture quality settings ( e.g. contract , saturation , sharpness ) . help screens really tell me something when i'm confused . i appreciate " modeling " feature . it useful when attempting compose dark situation . it also lets me see reflections before they committed picture . unfortunately this feature not work using built-in flash . i wish nikon could add some type lock continuous-single-manual focus selector front camera . my finger seems move switch unknowingly . i would appreciate battery charger built plug rather than detachable cord . person who still wears thick glasses , i wish nikon could make viewfinder more like one their old n8008 . or maybe it time away pentaprisoms mechanical mirrors give us truly pro camera mimics high-end pro-sumer models electronic viewfinders adjustable view screens	1

i sticked sony since i got my first digital camera 4 years ago sony camera moneys worth ! this one dsc-t10 one parent who carrying much already needs pack down change . it fits my purse still space more , only thing remember buy slim fitting case camera extra battery(for those kind battery not sold everywhere ) you need one when you don't thing you need extra battery , you always run out wrong time . i recommend this one	1
first all , this camera every feature any beginner - intermediate - professional photographer could ask . macro / zoom capabilities outstanding , little practice use tripod or patient steady hand . use top lcd ( waist level ) best way shoot low level shots , otherwise rear lcd fine everything else . too many features list , ( read manual all features ) but main one shots this camera produces excellent . i suggest using photoshop editing , any good photographer attest . want see many more photos taken this camera ? see : [ nekophoto . com ] big bang buck what this camera all	1
i've read over all reviews i don't agree them . starters , i don't think this camera difficult use . this my first digital camera ever , i'm not problems using it . pictures crisp clear ; i'm very impressed quality pictures camera . if i one complaint it would straps handle keep coming undone i really feel quality could better ; i've 2 instances which my new camera almost crashed ground so my advice not carry thing around handle	1
traveled abroad this . multi-voltage , no cords ( though it obscure 2nd socket if it go top one any reason ) . charges 2 once , which really convenient , but note it takes almost 2x long doing one	1
takes excellent photos . love zoom . feels good your hands .	1
soon i got camera i could tell it good one instruction manual . i'm still reading learning how us it . my husband i enjoy trying out different features we'er pleased pictures we've taken . we highly recommend this camera both novis more experience photographer .	1
camera really very compacy nice . it easily fits into your pocket . very useful if you want take quick picture . only concern i you cannot change dpi ( dots per inch ) camera . you take 5mp resolution pictures but if dpi small it doesnt really help when you zoom . dpi limited 72 . such it not great concern unless you want zoom pictures take	1
i make movies this camcorder good result , but feel snapes noice . i think it not too much resulation . if you spend more mony then you buy high resulation panasonic or sony camcorder else it enough choice your budge .	1
i've digital cameras before , but this one it all . if you want take really good pictures your life then buy this camera . hp photosmart m527 6mp digital camera 3x optical zoom more features than i'll commonly use , but i think all them come handy specific settings . easy use great photo quality	1
really suprised how easy this camera use great photo quality . zoom great ! don't really care easyshare software .	1
i upgraded old 2 megapixel easyshare , boy am i glad i . it very eay use , pictures come out great . i find display looks little grainy , but pictures never come out way . lens cover comes off very easily , i am not fond kodak software	1
sigma doesn't seem third-party lens company any longer . i like this super-wide angle lens . considering its price , sharpness well color awesome . also , it very quiet hypersonic motor . comparison tokina 12-24 , it 2mm more but 2mm quite big crop body ( nikon 1.5 ) . if i mention its drawbacks , i would say this lens applied only digital slr camera its aperture f/4- 5.6 .	1
this case just it looks , but it would helpful strap you put your shoulder or handle or something . if you don't care straps , then i would recommend this case you	1
pack holds two en_el3 batteries makes holding camera even easier . checking battery power you determine exactly what percentage power left each battery . it ' heavy , but i like camera	1
i've always hated how cumbersome it shoot verticals 35mm digital : contort one arm over head , twist wrist , etc . this pretty much solves problem . granted , it difficult reach thumb pad camera , but least you use af-on button front wheel change focus areas . build quality ? i figure nikon went plastic minimize weight cost . i wish latch battery door bit more robust , however . it changes balance camera , making it feel much more ' centered ' , especially my goto lens , 18-200mm vr . it also much better balanced my sb-600 flash attached . overall , i'd say this ' must ' , probably second accessory you should get after flash unit . oh yes , it also tends command r-e-s-p-e-c-t people , good or bad ..	1
amazing , this essential accessory proven more than invaluable . mb-d200 attached your nikon d-200 you not only extra power small package additional grip controls take vertical shots , but , you also maximize battery use take full advantage nikon built-in battery monitor . this feature not only tells you percentage battery life left , it also tells you number photos taken specific battery . furthermore , camera so smart , it first uses one battery then other . thus making it no-brainer which battery needs recharged . seconds , battery menu tells you each battery status one glance . only regret removal voice recorder included mb-d100 battery pack nikon d-100 . perhaps nikon bring this feature back- it very helpful when trying quickly identify photos assignments	1
i bought this camorder around 3 months ago so far i am very happy it . first off let me say i am complete amateur when it comes camcorders . i lot research online though before buying this particular camcorder saw nothing but positive reviews 3 ccd camcorder i only paid $400 it , which same good 1 ccd camcorder . i 20 month old baby i use it primarily home video footage . i able take it out box use it very quickly . i keep setting ' auto ' most time works just fine me . picture quality excellent , colors vibrant camcorder easy use . i read lot camcorders not performing well ' low light situations ' this camera pretty well , even though i notice when i shoot video my basement ( which not very bright ) picture slightly grainy . however when room bright or when i am outside picture incredible . zoom not great but i am not shooting more than 10 feet away anyway , so doesnt bother me . i am going buy video light see how improves my indoor video . overall , i am extremely happy this camcorder highly recommend it	1
very sensitive cold weather . pouts not put its lens out if left jeep overnight montana even if it spring there only light flurry evening . i just getting everything set perfectly ( yes , it taken me 4 years ) when lens quit extending . it now paperweight or doorknob art . it still read cards ... plus , door knob art , i think . i saw one person whose camera didn't work them winter very well all , mine worked fine while dog sledding other great times montana this camera moved florida all once . shooting it fully automatic you would cheap compact , you miss out many features , not mention : many good photos dawn through dimly lit club wee hours ~ ~ all without flash . if you read manual , you work this camera , which ways personalize settings without worries you always " return default " without concern . mine enjoyed over exposing when running free fully automatic full daylight . i wish it would better identifying moving targets selecting shorter exposures , even rapid mode . these problems aside , camera itself capable very good photos . advised , this could point shoot , but get photos you really want , decisions must made ! i don't believe this casual photographer only interested point-and-shoot . feel basic photography concepts : using aperture or timing priority or fully manual ; knowing what effects iso exposure compensation , etc . these all explained enough manual you operate camera enough enjoy it , i think . if you know how use picasa , simplest way add uv filter , i think , you don't even need buy proprietary click version actually place camera make your photos look more appealing professional . go go irish gypsy my space page see photos all taken this camera . i strongly recommend spending few hours advanced manual camera learning properly how exposure , white balance focus controls work . it really pay off ! what you see approximately 1 knuckle length wide 1.5 knuckle long display screen what you get . though it difficult see itsy bitsy screen bright daylight , this camera really shines dim light help things like white balance make sure you don't get false sepia tone makes things look so awful dim light photos image stabilizer mode , which i used even tripod , case i forgot turn it back . either way , this camera ate batteries like bear huckleberries . my battery recharger worn out !! i'll replacing camera recharge . all all , worth cost purchasing camera first digital camera . it bulky , i miss out some great shots because i didn't feel like hauling camera me some particular excursion . i hope my replacement take shots nicely . ~~~~~~ may i say i purchased this through here amazon darn fine job !!	1
this camera good response time , nice picture quality ( you would expect canon ) , excellent battery life ( i use 2500 mah rechargeable batteries ) . low light performance very good too	1
i this camera 2 years now . before i bought this camera i smaller camera 3x zoom . i didn't really miss zoom option my previous camera but now i 10x zoom powershot s1 i'm not sure how i could live without it past . camera takes good pictures it easy operate . you use predefined modes if you want .. or you adjust lot stuff manually if you into :-) only problems this camera size lens cap . it " big " bulky ... no , it not big slr camera but it still bit bit stick your pocket when you going out friday night . camera lens keeps falling all time it not big problem but time time lens gets dirty due this problem . i posted lots pictures taken this camera my homepage ( check profile ) . all pictures nyc trip until today taken camera . conclusion : i would not hesitate recommend powershot s1 ( or new s2 ) people i know : -	1
i use this golf yardage when i'm location where yardage hard determine . very accurate . require steady hand . would not recommend more magnification than this one it would very difficult hold steady enough target small flag	1
my husband i bought this case cruise we took over holidays . we absolutely so glad we ! yes , waterseal ring little wierd figure out first , but really , once you get down , this case cinch ! i absolutely love able take video underwater well photos . here we , swimming sting rays i capture every moment it ! i can't reccomend this case more . just follow instructions beware what they say using flash without diffuser --- it true , image gets all funky if you use flash without it , so don't . otherwise , very simple user friendly .	1
i read reviews i little nervous putting my camera case some people claimed leaked . i took my camera jamaica loaded it into case ( carefully reading following instructions ) it work out great . pics turned out awesome , camera safe water . i recommend this anyone who interest taking their camera or near water . if you want your underwater pictures come out well , you definitely need put camera underwater setting . because neutralization blue hues you cannot take pictures things more than 20 feet away without there blurred or hard see items . if you switch camera setting pictures come out overly blue or blurred . thing , it easy switch camera modes . just aware what mode you're . thing watch out if you using camera around water , but not necessarily water , sometimes water spots get lens leave good picture some blurry marks . it easily taken care dipping camera water letting water naturally run off or using clean cloth wipe away water . avoid touching inside case , finger prints very annoying try look through while underwater or some type sun glaze	1
this not case frills . camera fits snugly inside but there no room anything else such battery charger or even case memory card . it feels flimsier than i expected but so far i no problems workmanship , so attribute may just my interpretation .	1
fits fine , but its little hard get it fast , it goes well design .	1
product arrived well packed great working order . we paid extra overnight delivery so i would it before leaving town . it arrived day late i buy one . my return i advised amazon problem promptly refunded extra overnight charge . thanks ! that why i use amazon .	1
not bad , whole , watching wildlife dark . good illumination nice balance magnification , field view , use w/o tripod . sharpness falls off edges viewing area . i could recommend this wildlife watchers who might considering their first night-vision device . since this my first , i no comparative information whether there might better ones out there	1
this got best camera money you buy right now !! i looking affordable camera , small thin , well-known name brand , takes sharp digital photos , shoot low light , uses cheap sd cards , good-sized lcd display , take decent videos . well , this casio exilim everything more , great price . i used it so much during my out-of-state travels without running out power or memory ( i bought 2gb sd card $20 [ ... ] i take more 1000 hi-res photos or hour video ) . i absolutely surprised how good videos i shoot this small digital camera , now i decided not buy new video camcorder , this casio exilim all i would need any occasion . if you're market great camera , look no further than casio exilim	1
my experience , this camera takes great pictures , but zoom lens so delicate it breaks easily . it stops extending just makes clicking noise . this happened me when camera accidentally turned while my pants pocket rendering camera unusable . my brother two my friends experienced similar problem their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped camera while lens extended . i would recommend looking into camera not so delicate	1
it must addition a530 camera , especially when learning use camera , running slide shows tv . saves big time batteries !!! only reason i rated it less than 5 stars it little large	1
case works what i need it just carry around my digital camera .	1
i wanted something could take some wear tear easy carry so after lot consideration i chose this case . excellent choice , it " cushioned , long strap , very lightweight . not pretty ... but functional	1
my wife got me this camera christmas greatest feature it i not charge batteries once since i got it ( 4 months now ) . during time i took approximately 600 pictures made 20 videos . it perfect non-professional photographer . makes it easy choose setting various occassions ( party , indoor , night , panorama , etc . ) it takes great overal pictures . i think this camera great people who like take occassional pictures friends , partys or vacation . good buy price . i would definately recommend i t.p.s. get least 512 mb memory card	1
i just purchased this camera easier travel use . my main camera nikon d70s but it too big travel easily . canon sd750 very compact camera . camera not come carrying case so i purchased leather case which i think necessary addition . video somewhat grainy full screen except 640 mode ( 30 fps ) which seems quite good very watchable 20 inch computer monitor full screen . still picture quality excellent . side side pictures my nikon show comperable quality which quite amazing such small package . camera easy use . i purchased 2 gb extreme card which i think perfect my use , especially video . 2 gb card appears give me 15 minutes video 640 resolution . all all camera exceeded my expectations	1
canon resumes its position top all camera manufacturers . their design , performance , quality hard match . now onto camera : i shot around 4-5 gigs worth photos various settings , so i good idea what this camera offer . features itself within camera excellent . aside increased megapixels , it not much different than sd700 except some odd reason , canon decided opt out ( image stabilization ) feature . i almost gave it 4 stars based solely aspect . but other than , camera brilliant . portraits close-ups , face detection feature phenomenal which reflection new digic iii technology . camera lock human face or multiple faces ( i've locked up 8 ) keep it focus no matter where you move or pan camera . if you're shooting indoors or low-light , iso set high 1600 so you lot flash exposure control if you don't like spotlight look when using flash . there also auto iso setting which gives user lot range shoot . it determine proper iso setting shutter speed also predict camera shake resulting less blurry pictures . i guess this makes up not . :) if you novice photographer don't like mess iso , aperture settings , shutter speed variations this camera fit your needs just fine . it 17 shooting modes including " scene " modes different settings you may shooting such beach , fireworks , snow , portraits , night , etc . fully automatic so any beginner pick up this camera shoot like pro . most popular feature 3 " lcd screen . it ginormous . but order get big screen such compact camera , canon forgoes optical viewfinder . so if you're viewfinder shooter , then you may not like fact you limited just lcd screen image framing . one shortcoming camera it still weak zoom . 3x optical nothing so zoom feature pretty much non-existent . movie features camera awesome . i like time lapse movies where you record time lapse up 2 hours condense it into 4 or 8 minute movie . so if you want make cool " cloud moving " effect or " budding flower " you accomplish this camera . video resolution excellent vga frame rate 30fps . overall , camera satisfies all users simple enough use beginners also boasting features professional appreciate . it also looks bitchin two tone effect people admire . corners intelligently rounded so it slips easily out any pocket you may want put it .	1
incredible price size . very clear secure . good deal	1
i've used this since 2001 extensively 2006 now it usga legal . not sure why others trouble holding this steady . anything lt ; 200 yards i no problem hitting flag ( you don't aim stick , you aim flag ) . excellent getting distances bunkers , trees , other hazards . 200 over it difficult me hit flag , but all you wait someone pull or reinsert pin , you beam it off player . inside 150 i've never problem getting distance . i learned first laser object behind pin ( such tree ) , then move up pin so i know sure i'm getting flagstick not tree background . my dad " pinseeker " model it quicker easier beam off small object , but it also lot more expensive ... it larger .	1
so far i've this camera week im am pleased everything . its actually my 10th digital camera i think i've finally found one i like . it takes beautiful pictures , film good movies it also great sound . its also smaller than any other camera i've bought better looking . i think it takes pictures better night though sometimes good thing . buy it cause its very nice !!	1
bought this camera my teenage daughter who wanted something sleek . camera all powerful too . photo quality excellent camera easy operate . video feature works very well , also . my daughter found controls intuitive enough she hardly look user manual . battery life good although you can't charge it without removing battery . extracting inserting battery pretty straightforward not inconveinient you might think . this easy pick solid , versatile camera	1
easily best tripod i've ever owned , including some considerably more expensive ones . only problem remote . you must turn video camera before connecting . when camera turns off automatically , disconnect wire , turn camera , plug remote back . what pain	1
i absolutely love this frame !! i bought their smaller frame months ago , it great ! i get so many compliments it , i'm so happy see this larger one this amazingly low price ! wow .. i'm buying it mother day , one my husbands office ! way , i've great customer service these folks ! love it !	1
i gave my mom this frame gift her birthday . i just put 300 or so pictures old memory card i uploading them through my camera usb connection , then removed card my camera plugged it into frame it . she loves it everyone birthday dinner really wowed when i lifted cloth i covering it it moving through photos i choose . also , i like frame construction because it seems better made than others i seen . true there not much way instructions it works best if you extra memory card you not using you just keep frame all times . memory cards so cheep now i upgraded mine 2 gig gave her my smaller one	1
case cost $5 , shipping $15 . this case suggested my newly purchsed kodak v705 purchase . guess what--doesn't fit !! it worth returning -- no . so i've got great case that too small . should never suggested this product	1
if you kodak v550 or v530 model , you should buy this case , it beatiful perfect fit those cameras . it must buy item . much more important then spare battery ( i bought one never use ...	1
it fits my sd550 wonderfully could throw extra memory card/battery case well . i love material yes you really fit case your pocket	1
after reading product details section amazon kodak schneider-kreuznach xenar 1.4 55mm telephoto lens ( combined paucity available information elsewhere ) , i expecting receive lens measuring 2 1 1 � inches ...... advertised ! go take look . those figures you read too ? what surprise then open package discover this hugely massive lens unit . yup , first thing i check see if what i received what i ordered ... 8756488 ...... it . actuality , lens measures more than two inches diameter base where it connects lens adapter , three inches length exceeds three inches diameter objective face . hold your thumb forefinger three inches apart take look . lot glass ! adapter coupled 1.4 lens adds full five inches length camera , comes close ( just hefting each hand ) doubling weight my p880 camera . this date , no other reviews mention this discrepancy , which why i am bringing issue up . i am rather thrilled i this massive impressive looking piece photographic equipment ... but it sure not camera i stick my pocket , if it comes down camera hanging my shoulder all day hike , i'm going giving serious thought doing it second much smaller camera . i update this review when i more experience using lens . now , giving it 4 star so not skew current ratings . awesome looking piece serious equipment !! i added picture it shown my kodak p880 so you see yourself just how much lens this .	1
purchase my telephoto lens really great investment . i love way it brings objects closer view my photo taking	1
nice camcorder . easy use . see tapes right away unlike digital camcorders . this gift my 14 year old grandaughter she loves it	1
perfect family , mother , child , everybody ! i've it 4 moths its perfect . i take all pictures i want , etc etc . everybody loves color ! loved it ! buy it !	1
i love this camera . color great , so fun makes me feel unique . screen great size , it takes great pictures . good red eye issue . menu great too , when you scroll thru things , it tells you what it so you don't memorize it all . takes fast pictures , but not one after , like i hoping . but it open fast . don't fooled big memory , you still need larger card . depending size pic you want , you take 30 50 pics memory alone . but all all i love this camera it great buy	1
sony w55 followup successful popular w50 . it very good compact camera , easy carry easy use , reasonably priced - so most people happy it . not much changed w50 , which this case good thing ! one change w55 7 mp camera , rather than w50 6mp . honestly , that not big plus , they haven't made sensor catches light any larger . same ( good ) lenses , same size sensor = same ( good ) pictures , but not better . ( though it might help little features like smart zoom . ) obvious change course colors . don't make too much fun ! there 4 dsc-w series cameras our family , colors would kept my mother-in-law taking my sister camera home her . little personalization good thing . internal memory expanded ( 56mb ) , but i've never used internal memory cameras it , so i'm not sure matters much . it might worth knowing how use backup , dozen or two shots if your card full , or you some other problem . controls , menus interface w55 reasonably easy use . example , w55 easy access various scene modes ( twilight , etc ) , some explanation screen what those mysterious little icons mean ( so you might actually use them , since it tells you what they ! ) . if you're new digital photography , there learning curve . but if you've used other cameras much , especially sonys , you pick this up use many features right away . read short introductory guide comes camera , though ! rechargeable battery should easily last you full day shooting - hundreds shots - no problem . ( little wise turning it off when you're not using it ! ) so you probably don't need second battery , unless you're going into woods while . it nice not mess bulky aa rechargeables . also , lithium ion batteries don't memory effect , so don't worry partial recharging . just charge battery each night . so - before getting second battery , try it while see if you need it . but get case - something protect screen , least . fully closed one might help resist rain splashes little , too . you'll also want get memory stick pro duo card - pro cards faster , you need smaller duo size this camera . get 1-2gb card so you don't think running out memory too much - if you shop carefully , you find them so little these days it well worth avoiding running out memory . you might want spare card if you plan travel more than week , or use video mode often - which surprisingly good ( though bit dark ) if set fine , but uses enormous amounts storage setting . you stretch your memory , your hard drive space , using one lower-resolution settings take snapshots . you don't really need 7mp all your photos ! w55 take better photos than those credit-card type cameras tiny lens system - optics always make difference camera . any reasonable person very happy pictures w55 , given size it . camera little slow often take disappointing pictures low light dark situations . try high iso mode low light no-flash situations - picture quality suffers some , but most people find it useful . realistically , no ultra-compact camera work really well situation - if you need often , think something bigger lens bigger sensor . good light always gives best pictures any camera . there limits what you currently expect any ultracompact camera . w55 offers enough controls ( through scene modes program mode ) allow fair amount control over pictures , automatic camera . charger fairly compact rated 100-240v , so while you'll need plug adapter overseas you won't need voltage converter . battery charger little slow , though probably ok . keep this camera charged handy , you'll find you take lot pictures because it easy carry easy use	1
i've only camera few days , so i hope write more encompassing review later . but i'm writing now clarify movie function dmc-lz7 record sound ... i read ( maybe product specs ) there no sound , so i quite happy discover otherwise ! i purchased camera its low-light abilities thought i give up sound get it -- so glad i wrong . note : nearly-identical dmc-lz6 not record sound . lack sound-recording size lcd monitor ( lz7 2.5 inch screen , lz6 2-inch screen ) seem only differences models . certainly worth extra $30 or so get dmc-lz7 sound . dmc-lz7k movie quality good digicam . my only comparison my 4-5 year old canon elph -- it much better than . old elph only records approx 15 second clips , lumix keep going until you fill up your card . one might expect , there noticable chromatic noise using iso settings above 800 -- but even manual says setting basically only suitable 4x6 prints . but least you get picture extreme conditions , even if quality less than optimal . again , comparing my old camera - 1200 iso lumix looks like 400 iso my old elph . lumix 400 iso looks great , least monitor . i haven't printed anything yet . shutter response time good i no major complaints , least not so far . i'm using rechargable aa batteries sandisk extreme iii 1gb card . both working well this camera .	1
very nice product . completely protects camera without hindering any operation . there simple velcro flap pull down take pictures - that it . very good inclement weather picture taking regular use well . you not remove camera case even replace digital cards or battery - just unzip bottom . this case little pricy , but perfect hp series camera	1
bought it connect my new sony hd3 hdv camcorder my sony kdf60xbr950 . works perfect	1

good it claims . great golf hunting . easy use good eye relief adjustment or without glasses .	1
this thing works exactly advertised . i use it golf , it very good job separating flag other background objects , even when wind or my over-caffeinated hands make it hard get target centered flag . even works when there no wind flag hanging straight down . this well worth cost adder over cheaper ones don't work nearly well	1
i get bandwagon here . this superb little camera , definately five stars ! i also tz1 , which showed promise , but limitations . my review tz1 , i noted it lots " noise " pictures shouldn't printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they sharp . i also wanted more manual controls . tz3 fixes improves almost everything tz1 adds some new , very useful features . noise drastically reduced , lens better , sensor bigger , processor not only faster , but produces better pictures . tz3 adds very handy " function " button - or i should say function capability - number buttons same - which gives immediate access five or so " most used " settings without go into menues - which there several . tz3 keeps mega optical image stabilization adds intelligent iso , increases sensitivity without adding noise , ( i not tried 3200 setting yet . ) , increases size viewing screen , etc ., etc . tz3 " well-rounded , " very capable camera . there simply no comparison tz1 tz3 far quality pictures . tz3 wins hands down . my opinion it also beats some big name , higher priced digicams - couple which i own - rather handily . course , big selling point tz3 still 10x lens - now wide angle capability - pocket-sized point shoot camera . this lens sharp , combined larger sensor new processor yields some excellent results . while there no manual controls , per se , camera seems very well without them . pictures sharp , exposures seem nicely ( haven't tried it night yet , but low light forrest shots excellent ) , colors accurate , appropriately saturated , vivid ( ok . i like vivid setting . ) , good contrast , etc . there variety af settings , settable focal points , focus modes . there also exposure compensation , exposure bracketing available - they work well ! live histogram welcome bonus . tz3 focuses down 2 inches macro mode - again excellent , sharp results . tz3 very well speced out . one nice thing gone lens cap tz1 . it really not inconvenient , but seemed always swinging wind add yet source camera shake . tz3 lens includes built lens cover . very welcome . i currently own five top flight digicams ( including this one ) , owned many others , i am most impressed this one - combined convenience results . it quantum step forward . i also couple quite nice , fairly complete dslr kits . they wonderful , class themselves , but when i want very nice pictures convenience pocketable point shoot 10x , wide angle lens , or back up dslrs , tz3 now my camera choice .	1
i torn sony panasonic ( canons seemed many recurring complaints especially decks ) , after reading several reviews became gradually partial panasonic , before ever used one , based customer loyalty consistently glowing testimonials . well i've never used comparable sony , jvc , or canon xl2 ( some limited experience gl2 ) , but best i tell without personal comparison this camera fact deserve all great reviews . image quality excellent many cases looks good broadcast tv video ( nonhd ) , camera allows tremendous amount image control -- manual focus ring , aperture ( iris ) , gain adjustment , shutter speed , zebra control overexposure , white black balance adjusting , daylight filters , etc . electronic viewfinder even focused via simple diopter . there six preprogrammed , but customizable , settings image control so user simply dial whatever setting they need based shooting/lighting conditions . so , example , you shoot occasionally under weak flourescents lights -- you adjust white balance gain detail level accordingly , save it particular " scene file " ; whenever you return same location or similar shooting environment , you click over saved settings instant start recording . first four factory set video 60 frames ; last two 24 fps more film-like quality , which this camera handles beautifully . what actually sold me camera , terms hardware , two xlr jacks -- comparably priced models didn't seem offer this . xlr jacks allow user attach professional shotgun mics bypass mediocre factory one , taking fuller advantage 16bit 48khz stereo recording . i use fairly inexpensive azden mic improvement sound quality tremendous . if you willing invest finer mics audio quality would better still . two xlr inputs means addition recording live audio ( like mic ) you also mix input pre-recorded source -- all camera ! lens leica also impressive -- it bit wide not interchangeable ( although i believe there adaptive telephoto $$$) . i prefer shooting wide but if you need wide selection lenses or don't enjoy look wide angle look canon . drawbacks minor -- camera rather cumbersome -- would certainly tiresome handheld use it isn't designed shoulder-mounted use . i shoot almost exclusively indoors tripod so neither these issues relevant me . also irrelevant me reviews i've read which indicated lackluster battery performance -- again shooting indoors i always it plugged thus haven't noticed any battery problems . little menu joystick control button used toggle menu screens , well vcr playback options , frustrating when you're tired , but extremely trivial concern really . this camera expensive , even $1500+ prosumer class it tends more professional range , but i feel it great value considering what fine piece equipment it wealth features it offers . it much much more than enough camera consumer probably little more than i need actually--i've used mine few months i'm still learning how wring better better shooting it . once you've used it while it becomes clear why this particular model maintains devoted following . if i replace this camera -- provided i afford -- next camera would definitely panasonic probably its big hd brother hvx	1
description , it " well balanced highly portable : 4.4 pounds full operating condition " , not 10 pounds , which * shipping * weight . just wanted say . it lighter than xl	1
bought two ; both worked perfectly out box , no problems . easy load pictures , not very technical . exactly what we wanted family members . ideal relatives , baby pictures , etc . only problem pictures not necessarily show full screen , depending your original jpeg . would buy few more any day	1
this camera very nice . i actually bought it my g/f she loves it . when it first arrrived i got mess w/ it bit before giving it up her . i really enjoyed different settings take picutres . its great cause usually you get those shots way too bright because flash or too dark because no flash . this camera takes care both problems easy . i even enjoyed software it came w/ . only problem i when you upload pictures computer sure you push " safely remove hardware " button or you end up getting camera say there more pictures camera than there . this easy solve though . theres way you clear camera memory but im not sure i remember how . so problem more user error than product problems . great camera great price . it might not same prices since i got it electronics expo so it knocked down price but it worth original price . so theres my review . not depth but point . good enough	1
it not any usb connectivity . there no way hook this up your computer except through tv type hookups . other than it works great . you need software convert dvd something els able edit it your computer though ( edit movie make copies)i like it write direct dvd so if you don't want edit it , there no need bother computer . aware it only works certain types dvd . won't work dvd-rw . dvd-r only certain typre ram disk	1
i use this set my celestron 4se meade etx-90 no problems . optics seem pretty good quality ep construction good . just kit gave me instant increase versatility . it provides beginner intermediate astronomer number combinations eyepieces filters experiment . some good publications go long way toward learning sky . case compact very handy . it also room few extra items . well worth what i paid it then some	1
i very disappointed when aa batteries my digital camera came died within couple days . i've using this year half now , since i switched , i've never gotten so much low battery warning , even when i've taken couple hundred pics charges	1
this camera easy use great zoom . cheap considering all functions it . great product	1
i bought this my daughter , who 22 . she loves all great features clear pictures which it produces . she specifically enjoys range editing capabilities built into camera	1
works great , no fogging up , i put camara fridge before i use it , or if you come airconditioned environement no problems . if you get grease lens wash it liquid soap , else you water drops dont rinse they blur photo . my kids took hundereds fotos fishes .. never one before . now you film well i needed upgrade 1gb chip my 512mb . all programing functions without openening case .	1
i got one these my starblast 4.5 eq i amazed -- cassini division cloud bands saturn opened my view . highly recommended getting last bit " oomph " small telescope	1
this case nice , but i think expanding sides unnecessary . camera easily slide out out unzipping sides , except elastic strap usually pop up flash when you put camera , then same strap won't let go flash when you pull it out ... unless you unzip all zippers pull it apart . this still best case this camera though , long you don't want carry extra batteries , sd cards , etc .	1
i replace lost one this canon battery charger perfect one my camera power shot pro 1 . good product , high price	1
this charger great . no cord trip over or store . batterys charge quickly charger fits your pocket or camera case pocket no cord become tangled other accessories . great , great product	1
this great camcorder . picture excellent . it well thought out features . i like fact you also take high resolution still pictures . it very small compact . only thing could better flash still pictures . i often get glare flash picture	1
bought this camcorder(my 1st ) after reading most reviews net . quality great video other than low light rating but most consumer camcorder same problem anyway ) , didn't expect take still camcorder so didn't care 3.1 mp . very easy use feels good my hand . i gave 4 because i know soon there better camcorder market this price range	1
this digital picture frame very good lcd display . long you resize your digital photos match resolution 860x480 , pics . fill-up frame . one drawback your original pics . cropped . my 1 gb cf card display over thousand pics . color brigthness still good even if you view it 6 8 feet . if you want you change frame wood if you handy . overall i'm happy this coby dp102 .	1
i've this camera couple weeks now , it my 4th digital camera . i am very happy photos i'm able take , they truly outstanding . i'm still learning all settings but i'm finding everything user-friendly . i like way it feels my hand i'm pleased battery life . i purchased 2gb card replace one came camera it perfect size me . video amazing , i standing upstairs bathroom our 2 story house saw our little one jumping trampoline far end our backyard , so i decided tape it . not only quality good , camera picked up audio , which i never expected ! i like you zoom or out while you're taping , i wasn't able my last camera . i've no problems downloading pics or videos my computer prints i've gotten great well	1
i just got back my first trip using this camera , it performed excellently . two things i found very good : night shots high iso no flash outstanding . i took lot pics hong kong skyline , they just stunning . no blurry image crisp colors lines . there no need " no shake " , given these pics possible this high iso no tripod . battery endurance unbelievably long . i taking pics constantly all over hong kong two straight days , including lot night shots . battery lasted entire time . i bought second battery backup , but i rather doubt i am every going need it , this kind endurance . this best compact camera i ever owned	1
it amazing how much they squeeze into such small space . i owned one form elph or , past 7 or 8 years , they've always top quality . this version no exception . everything you'd expect one leading names digital cameras . screen big , menus onscreen information clear everything very intuitive . picture quality fantastic ! crisp hi res , many options size quality . detail some my shots simply astounding ! video capture some best i've seen none dedicated camera . 640x480 @ 60 fps mode , quite startling when you first see it . improved video capabilities one main reasons i upgraded . battery life seems very good . infact , i'd say it bit improvement over my last elph . i purchased extra battery , so i could charging one , while using other . i still haven't switched batteries yet :) overall , very please . this great , stylish , neat , full featured , camera	1
this ideal starter camera beginner . i found it easy use simple get started . however software comes this camera not so great . it runs slow my system features most people won't really ever use such greeting card maker . you're going want memory card this camera internal memory doesn't hold huge number pictures	1
standard proviso tech stuff always gets better cheaper , i highly recommend this new camera model low price . i only it two days , since nikon didn't warranty my broken lcd screen my l4 . please careful fragile nature these electronics ! i didn't drop it or abuse it , it apparently broke my pocket within padded case ! back l10 , most everything better than previous , low end , cameras , improved sound , what great me , voice recording capacity , outside 20 second voice memos attached particular photo . while digital voice recorders cheap pcs , i mac previously , only ipods accessories , or other costly recorders , create sound files then imported your computer then burned cds . just 512 mb card , you record hours . image quality bit bluish , some color cast hopefully corrected software . sharpness looks o.k. , price , it fine me . this makes great back-up camera , i use more expensive series camera . road , i can't afford missing great scenic shot , or hundreds those . l10 smaller slimmer than l4 . it carries well your pocket . it slightly simpler buttons controls . lens retraction quicker shut-off , zoom rather abrupt . other new , handy features characteristic planned obsolescence most tech items . goodies you wanting upgrade ! it remain seen how durable this camera turns out , but i high hopes . i intend more careful , never subject this beauty shock or any possibility drops . speaking tech support rep , you need nickel metal hydride batteries more than 2000 mah worth power , lieu what they recommend ( nikon-approved rechargables ) . some my ray-o-vacs aren't . i'm using only approved sd cards , but they now support up 4gb cards . that great if you trust card not fail -- why i buy several smaller capacities , therefore don't all my eggs one basket . you'll get enough memory , then 4 gb , probably then , few thousand photos storage . one major thing they work streaks still appear movie mode when faced bright reflections or sun . not bad earlier l , these don't appear final still images , but seen movies . you then remember not shoot movies outside evenly lit scenes . my older coolpix cameras didn't this problem . movie quality pretty good , but bit down my movies using my l5 . shooting movies train , bells horns much clearer sounding than earlier models . despite what ads say , i find no vr feature this model , nothing it manual . unless it enabled all time , which it seems not , you may wish wait till this excellent feature becomes standard all models . more serious photographers , vr included higher end , new l . also , i see nothing iso capability 800 , but i haven't yet tried night or low light scenes . one telephoto came out blurred , no blur warning , there . all all , this fantastic technology , all highly affordable price , although nikon isn't top rated brand it used , i'd get this first , around-the-home back-up , digital camera , if you haven't owned good one yet	1
i actualy bought this camera impulse . my friends going day trip so decided i should get camera . couldn't happier purchase . very pleased how picture turned out . took great moving still shots . i would recommend this camera everyone	1
just purchased this camera today replacement my previous kodak point shoot 4.0 so far , im pleased it , easy figure out how use my purposes e.g. simple photos , it working just fine . i really loved my other camera but my husband permanently " borrowed it " use work . i would recommend this camera people who want easy use device takes good , simple pictures .	1
this thing really surprised me price . you tell it cheaply made ( thin aluminum tubes cheap plastic latches ) but it cheap ! that whats great it . it really easy work . if you're going use it every day you might want something more sturdy , but amateur it sweet	1
this camera wonderful . novice i am , it perfect . basic mode very user friendly . lcd menus great . i purchased this model primarily due 12x optical zoom not disappointed . this model advanced modes i hope master my digital knowledge grows . if you're looking camera easy use excellent features , i highly recommend dmc-fz8	1
great battery , life without charging battery bigger than original , i bougth two my canon sd 600 they work perfectly	1
i ordered 2 these batteries my canon powershot sd600 . they arrived ontime . charged both my oem canon charger both worked right out box . just wanted some back up camera - spare batteries this price - you can't go wrong	1
good camera $129 i paid . everything pretty well , your picture modes pretty customizable . only qualm it takes second or two longer than i wish when camera saves/loads pictures memory card . might problem when trying shoot consecutive pictures -- but probably wouldn't doing it this type camera anyways .	1
this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . even close-up photos turn out great . you would think this camera more than 3.2 megapixels ! you get much larger memory card though , case most digital cameras	1
i found this light ideal my needs . it lightweight , compact powerful activated quickly when needed	1
i've wanted purchase pair binoculars couple years , but kept putting it off because i figured i'd dump least $300 quality pair . i wanted something compact , good quality , affordable . not exactly easy order . but after reading reviews these bins , i figured i'd give them try . all i say wow . these exactly what i looking . they provide very crisp image lower magnification levels . even 24x , although usually impractical , they lot fun . i find it easy focus change zoom level one hand which plus . general purpose viewing , these fantastic binoculars . bins shipped black velcro-flap carrying case belt loop back , small carrying strap you attach your bins	1
price , these binoculars provide unparallel carity easy focus . i like these binoculars so much i showed them couple co-workers right away . one them so impressed he ordered one his cousin birthday . great product , highly recommended	1
i bought couple binoculars past . always thinking higher magnification better . that not always true keeping object steady 10 higher your hands tough . higher mags also suck up light making image darker . now i eagleview zoom don't worry which model i should chosen . most part it stays 8 but when i really need get close zoom great . turn slide eyecups fine feature . love ' em	1
these lights came quickly great filming green screen shoot . case great too , because you wheel it around .	1
now , if i drop this camera , i , it keeps working . case safe keeps my camera safe small easy throw into my purse or pocket or strap throw over my shoulder .	1
i found this case just what i looking . it small enough fit my purse , but large enough hold camera , extra xcard , spare batteries . my camera protected we traveled overseas , but it easy pull it out any picture moments we encountered	1
well , i bought bino my 7 year old nephew introduce him birding . he loves it , infact he pronounced it " pretty cool " . good buy considering its compact what its supposed	1
actually , oil not prevent objective scratching slide , but instead allow slide viewed magnification all . high magnification refraction very high , lot light escape before it ever gets eye ( light going through glass , then air , then glass again , distorting its path greatly ) . oil used these microscopes same refractive index lens glass , so light travels through it same speed doesn't run off course	1
i am very pleased this camera . i photography 55 years i collection 12 cameras , last four these digital . i high end nikon cannon , but i think this best camera i ever owned	1
overall good lens , focus little soft 300mm . bokeh ok . canon dig reb xt auto focus sometimes oversearches . zoom control stiff . however , focal range great . this good walk around lens . i use it 100% now . 3.5 allows chance precious light short focal lengths . very good value money	1
item good fit what we need use it . would most likely rate it higher but we not used it enough so	1
i simply love this camera . i using over 1 year now no issues or problems . however , you must learn use functions properly optimum photo quality . auto setting great . many my photos look like professional portraits . everywhere i go people want check it out . wouldn't trade . i paid high price when it first came out . so today prices it well worth money	1
after springing cybershot august so i could compact camera i would actually take places , i've very , very pleased . last camera i older sony dsc quite bulky , ran batteries , shutter problems -- but it took great quality pictures interface features perfect , so i thought i would go dsct5 , since it avoids all those problems . only tiny battery charge , no sticky shutter ... it sexy hell . screen huge very bright . i hate taking pictures flash general , i find flash makes nasty redeye more often than not this camera . ( camera gives you impression you cant change shutter speed or anything ) however ! you easily change this going into over/under exposure options under exposing your photos when you dark environments . they come out surprisingly well blur-free	1
this light efficient . it fragile , so put lot emphasis not dropping it ! i like fact it uses same battery my sony vx1000	1
it just works ! it uses same batteries trv-900 , vx-2100 fx-1 or z1-ui only wish it horizontal	1
we purchased this camera using it couple months now . it great tool watching our 20 month old son his playroom during day if you leave room anything also night when he makes noise you aren't sure whether or not he really up awake needing you . pro con's: daytime - picture pretty clear but monitor small ; night vision - you tell if he standing up walking around crib but you can't see well enough see if he looks happy , sick or upset ; range - i use it throughout house but one end other picture sound quality suffer somewhat ; battery power - poor so i just keep it plugged into outlet ; mounting brackets - good ; interference wireless network - completely interfered rendered wireless network unusuable until brother-in-law reprogramed wireless network different frequency	1
my current camera olympus sp-320 . you read my review product page , if you wish . i like pictures i take , but i'm no pro there always someone whose pictures i admire more . i one friend who consistently takes great shots . when bunch us attended wedding last summer , there vibrancy her shots mine couldn't quite match . since she swore her canon power shot , i thought i'd give a570is chance . this weekend i both a570is sp-320 me weekend jaunt took half my pictures each camera , swapping back forth two . both cameras use two aa batteries . both optical viewfinders . both more modes than casual picture taker ever need . my hands , picture quality almost indistinguishable . some settings i prefer olympus ; others , canon , so a570si going returned since i'm well within return period . however , if i option returning olympus , too , i'd keep canon . here why : * canon slightly smaller . bulge olympus makes it harder find suitable case . * canon mode selector dial clicks firmly into place , unlike olympus which very loose . olympus dial often moves when camera removed its case . not so , canon . * canon 4x zoom compared olympus 3x . also , digital zoom better implemented canon . canon stops full optical zoom . if zoom slider released reengaged , digital zoom applied . this true even auto mode . olympus digital zoom not readily available every mode . when digital zoom available or turned , it lacks canon pause end optical zoom . pause . * a570is uses standard mini-b usb connector rather than what appears proprietary type olympus . none these -- or even all them together -- enough make me keep canon put olympus up ebay or half , but they'd enough get me pick canon if i didn't already own olympus	1
i used sd600 this blows it away . great taking pics moving car . worth every penny zoom shots ! fast action too	1
i really like this camera its so cute , only thing annoying when i download pictures my computer , which i often , camera its charger plugged then cameras usb cord plugged computer too course so i cord ( 3 ) going everywhere . i wish i able just sync camera into computer itself alone . but camera great very easy use . i really enjoy it . i would recommend this camera you .	1
this camera fast , small , lightweight . last year , we purchased s500 , so we knew what we getting . camera goes everywhere you go fit any pocket . i think picture quality incredible . camera simple operate downloads photos quickly using provided docking station . it isn't big do-everything high dollar camera , but money , it all features big camera small compact case	1
problem high power binoculars humans can't hold them steady , jitter makes it impossible really look something without tripod . image stabilization this pair solves problem holds things rock steady . this expensive product clearly distingues itself , one those products technology makes seem little magic . i only two small complaints : first , product this expensive they should pre-install neck strap you -- not big deal , but it would nice customer . second , i wish lens cap covers higher quality attachable unit so they wouldn't get lost . again , not big deal . these without doubt best binoculars i've ever used	1
this very good , fancy looking case my fujifilm camera nice sturdy body . looks awesome . only problem i see this camera it doesn't protect whole camera , which looks good but still makes me little bit worried when i put it bag other things . overall , good buy	1
i would recommend this case your panasonic camera . i took it trip europe recently it worked perfectly . i wore it my belt , which kept camera easily accessible without worry putting it down somewhere forgetting it . it fits protects perfectly , price right , it weighs almost nothing . i didn't give it full five stars only because i would preferred better quality leather - picky , picky ..	1
it nice little product works very well . it took me awhile get battery cover off though i'm guessing they used pneumatic drill factory put . i use it city , commensurate my job , though any type red light or walk light not helpful you seeing anything . but what you pay this little handy device isn't bad it works within restrictions tech	1
more than expected great price	1
i wanted good quality consumer grade digital camera take short trips , so i purchased this one . i think quality picures very good it most features i wanted . it few dollars more than i really wanted spend , but all all i am pleased . my main complaint battery life little short side , it takes while see photo you just took lcd screen . i really want something hold me two years , then these things twice good fraction cost . now it what i need it pretty well	1
after reading reviews here i little hesitant it high maintenance care , but you just need follow some simple directions it should give you plenty life . it amazing how functional camera case . every button feature used ( except infrared sensor , which must turned off ) even flash shines threw opaque cover sits case . loved case protecting my camera while skiing one best days my life , now i got pictures prove it . looking forward testing it out underwater .	1
first , this product rated 4 stars because there no cleaning cloth provided lens . i took 2 pictures glass door my house . 1 lens , 1 without lens . (...) this picture noway edited . well now u results , u think little easier whether buy , or not buy this product . pictures taken :d cr-trv33pictures compressed using : adobe photosho	1
accessory kit just what i wanted my new canon sd 630 . case fits perfectly extra battery real plus	1
again , i too try not duplicate efforts other reviews . i am not pro , but i am pretty advanced user , this least my 6th digital camera ( i used work industry so it easy get them ; i didn't whole bunch break me ) . i bought it because i wanted great camera hobby shooting but didn't want deal separate lenses . this not " first-digital-camera " ; it better suited people who pretty familiar digital cameras looking camera grown into . you choose " point-and-shoot " option or any several manual options . if you wish employ manual controls , camera take practice . there lot bells whistles , someone else mentioned , i would highly recommend reading instruction manual experimenting it before you take it big vacation ( bring manual too ) . image quality fantastic , even when you maxing out zoom . i take my pictures 8mp " fine " quality ; anything larger just overkill unless you're printing 20 " x30 " prints . nikon in-camera option creating compressed copy any picture you take ( e-mailing , etc . ) . i use macro feature lot , i took picture caterpillar plant even 4x6 print size , i could see hair folicles its feet . i also appreciate vibration reduction feature ( which you turn off ) flip-out lcd screen . before i purchased it , i looked canon 6mp digital rebel ( which felt too big my hands ) sony 8mp ( which , like most sony items , good quality but pricey ) . i ultimately decided nikon because it felt comfortable my hands , good reputation , high resolution flip-out screen . there lag time , there any digital camera . i don't notice it any better or worse than other digital cameras i've used . if you want no-lag , you need look d-70 or digital slr . battery life really very good , far digital cameras go , battery doesn't add much weight camera . if you going vacation or spend while getting your pictures " just right " before you take them , buy extra battery -- you won't regret it . i started using sandisk ultra ii 1gb cf card since not run out memory during outting . if you decide you want go 8800 , here some accessories you may want consider : spare battery ( en-el7)lens hood ( hn-cp14)nikon lens pen ( removes dust body lens) 1.0 gb cf cardlowepro rezo 140 aw camera bag which holds everything mentioned here room sparei my nikon over year now , i not experienced any lens error problems ( or otherwise ) so far . i'm sorry people trouble it because it really excellent camera i haven't once regretted purchasing mine . heartbeat , i would buy this camera again	1
this my first vibration reduction lens . i love it , now i hand-hold shots if i need . i haven't mine long so haven't used it lot yet , but images sharp contrasty . lens feels well built but isn't heavy . one downside slow minimum aperture , which means lens struggle focus low light or when pointing something shadow polarizer front . not let amazon sell you tiffen haze-1 uv filter go this lens , it causes focus errors unwanted reflections captured image . if you want protective filter this lens , you pay money get multicoated one	1
absolutely great daylight handheld photography . legendary nikon quality photographs easily obtained this lens . i use it mostly nature photography recently returned florida some excellent close up shots some birds . vr works very well hand held use . it big , heavy lens but worthy addition deserving nikon name . dav	1
advertised . would buy more . blinking light seals deal . i use real ones home but our office fakes good enough . people take notice	1
this met my needs completel	1
i received merchandise time promised excellent ( new ) condition . thank you .	1
after owning using camera month or so now , i am delighted it . i only replaced batteries one time , so don't know what review hullabuloo . small lightweight , many features . choice 6 meg , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 meg photos fingertips . what i really decided this camera macro capability i take photos very small coins , must able get within inch or two . it preforms magnificantly . my previous camera add additional lens this which hassle . i love samsung digimax s600 .	1
this radar gun works hockey pucks too . i crouched behind net zapped oncoming slapshots . just remember wear protective gear when behind net , especially full face helmet . when shots miss net , pucks bounce off boards find you .	1
received tri-pod yesterday , purchased based positive reviews amazon , very disappointed . tri-pod 80% plastic . all controls plastic , how long this last debatable . weight should clue . lesson learned see it person first . would not buy again .	1
first all i'am satisfied amazon free shipping i got tripod after week wich before begining estimate date . tripod really nice good looking , it black metal controlers knobs very smooth also it gives you ability move your camera different angles . i got this tripod because one reason , which i failed take pictures night using night scene mode ( which best camera settings take pictures night ) without coming out blurry simply , this tripod job	1
i owe alot this little camera . i just bought nikon d80 i am keeping it because it never let me down . it got me job photographer it clear images high resolution my clients always stunned ( i architecture photography ) ... i now very succsessful freelance business i am professional photographer ! i can't say enough how much i appreciate opportunity this camera gave me . i love this camera !!! also i may add its trooper ... i used abused never it gotten wierd ... people look it always tell me " wow big camera it looks very professional ... i would laugh say nope its pro-sumer camera ... but its feels like pro ! [ ............ ]*** warning***this not camera portraits or action***but its great outdoors , nature , architecture , ect ..	1
i switched digital few years ago , my little olympus fine outdoor shots , but i missed my old pentax spotmatic , especially indoors without flash . i got this camera because recent lowered price . i am very pleased nikon it like my old camara back , but digital . it everything extremely well , learning operation simple . i especilly like mode . i worried steep discount price meant something wrong camera , but this doesn't seem case . comparing it similarly priced digitals , this great buy ! people seem going big telephotos , but wide angle lens very handy . i always wanted nikon ...	1
this wonderful camera . it simple use , fabulous zoom fantastic price . i'm so pleased it	1
this no brainer . works great soften up flash , both direct bounce application	1
very simple , yet very effective diffuser . gets rid harsh shadows flash unit gives without one . also softens light great coverage when used specified instructions	1
first off , this camera simple use , very convenient size ( size fat ipod ) . video quality pretty decent , i use it upload youtube myspace videos . i would recommend it just , if you're looking uploading videos internet . videos saved really easily ( usb port directly unit so handy ) edited/spliced microsoft movie maker . ( using this program also cuts mb size considerably ! )my only complaint so-called 30 minute recording capability . i 3 minute video my card it said i only 21 minutes left recording . after i filled card i noticed i not full 30 minutes , maybe 18-20 . oh , audio bit funky side , mainly because it tends give lisp any ' ch ' ' ' sounds . look this camera up youtube see examples	1
this lens sharp , works very smoothly beautiful color . it first rate lens . i only wish it just tad bit longer - 16-60mm - would equivalent 24-90mm . it it equivalent 24- 67.5 mm 35mm terms .	1
well like many you out there i got hdtv christmas . then came upconverting dvd player , hd dvr , ps3 ! most hdtv only 1 hdmi input . how i going make use all this new amazing picture quality when i only connect 1 hdmi input time . so google i went . i came across quite few hdmi switches . some really expensive but i not recognized brands . then i saw pureav belkin ( mac ipod user i definitely recognized belkin ) . so i bought it ... i mean i too what else you ? it 3 connection one out tv . works exactly like it should . remote everything . solid really small unit . lay packs cards side side you size this unit . but i am extremely happy unit . ( oh way it comes 1 hdmi cable we all know those little suckers expensive ! all my other ones philips 6ft hdmi cables walmart $32 .	1
very easy use camera takes solid pictures . this camera allows zooming sound while taking video . i like you option cliping pictures out video clips . this allows some humerous pictures . i really like this camera . i problem zoom button 2 months after buying camera after month not using camera . i press button really hard it zoom . i called amazon take back product but they not very helpful informing me how much money they would refund me or how i take it hp if it under warantee . all all , camera very usable i plan keeping it not any other problems camera	1
just gone back using film camera digital ( my wife still uses digital ) i found this excellant camera so far . i taken 6 rolls film everyone one came out perfect . i would recommend it	1
after researching several cameras this price range , i bought rebel t2 last month . it met my expectations perhaps then some . after recently trying out friends camera 150 . -ish range , i partially regret spending what i . it all comes down what you need , want , how many bells whistles you like . money though , compared competitors , i still think i made good purchase . after all , if i use it ten years , which i most likely , i surely got my moneys worth . bottom line : no complaints it	1
i enjoy birdwatching naturally i wish photograph birds i see when i . i used this lens fz7 trip maui . i saw i'iwi apapane , but those birds flit around too much me able get pic . however , i able get couple decent pix a'eo ( hawaiian stilt ) distance 300 ' so i pleased . i going port aransas see whooping cranes soon am very much looking forward using this lens then . note : although image stabilization these panasonic cameras excellent you absolutely still need tripod my opinion make best use this fine piece glass	1
this awesome buy ! it takes great pictures easy use . it wonderful features simply love compact size	1
i many great experience this camera . touch screen so easy use picture scan wonderful . i took this camera huntington library my pictures came out wonderful !! colors so true beautiful . i took closed up picture pink flower it came out so clear nice .	1
right out box i began using this great camera . great quality pictures very easy use . i am glad i purchased it	1
sony vad-wa conversion lens adapter lets other lens attchments polarizing effects filters used sony cybershot cameras . it works just fine however , when this adapter together lens attachments and/or filters , considerable portion picture , particularly bottom center , gets dark . reason this flaw ( just what other reviews mentioned ) flash just above adapter which causes dark shadow bottom center portion picture . everytime flash used , specially night or low light conditions , shadow cast which blocks bottom 5-20 percent picture . slave flash attachment may solve this problem but according it reviews , it reputation not firing off , gives too much light , expensive price tag . overall , i still give sony vad-wa conversion lens 4 star	1
what i say this adapter except it works my w5 perfectly . just screw it like lightbulb then attach whatever lens you bought it . easy , easy	1
i panasonic lumix fz50 digital camera , when i use wide angle extension my lens , i can't use intrnal flash ( lens casts shadow ) . so , i began shopping flash . i shocked when i saw prices panasonic flashes this camera ($300 $500 ) . after searching internet , i found sunpack 383 flash . i little nervous buying it . i worried it might not sync well or some defect since price so much lower . well , i received flash , slipped it onto my camera hot shoe , it works beautifully . no glitches results great . i particularily like 3 automatic settings -- maximum distance , intermediate distance maximum depth field . it also great bounce flash head pointed any direction . reference marks give exact angle bounce . i'm very happy this purchased thrilled i saved quite bit money .	1
i got camera amazon 3 months ago its amazing . features amazing .	1
alright , so i've reading some reviews people put here this camera , i just want offer up nice statement " if you gave this camera 3 stars or less , you're retard . " i'm pretty sure amazon won't allow me say it , but it true ! this camera so freakin ' great ! i own this one xl1s , this my " toy " camera . i'm just 24 year old kid , so maybe my opinion means nothing you . if so , then stop reading this . no one asked you , anyway . this camera sells itself . compare it some others same category ( make sure you're checking out gl2 not predecessor gl1 ) . $2999 asking price here way too high , though . shop around , you should able find new one $1750 or so . extended warranty covers cleanings once year . so worth money . i take her ( my camera ... her name " mandy " ) everywhere , i've already made enough short movies people her pay herself . she take beating , too . i took her 75 degrees 8,000 ft above sea level 23 degrees 12,000 ft less than 6 minutes time she didn't complain all . she definite plus our snowboarding trip ! tired reading all those specs may not make sense you right now ? this camera usable someone who never used camera ( which me before i made my purchase ) , adjustable everything completely manual . my only qualm " noise " low low light . should expected , though . i use xl1s ( " jessica " ) , but don't let stop you your purchase this . this camera incredible ! i seriously love it .	1
it seems if every time i want use camera , battery dead . i find if i charge it try use it next day , i should expect very much . i'm going purchase new battery see how goes , but i shouldn't so	1
so far , i like camera quality pictures . once you get used red eye flash going off numerous times before actually taking picture ( possibly losing moment ) it pretty neat . screen awsome ! so clear ! some scene settings require tripod shutter speeds lot slower thus result some shake . one thing i am really not happy macro feature . i love take close up shots insects , flowers even nail art etc , but this very annoying feature : camera focuses constantly ( out , out , out ) like it convulsion or something . you try grab best focus ( shot ) when it " doing its thing " 9/10 , pic blurred . i wish there way just shut off focus it manually . it pointless ability macro shot close 1.6 " if it out focus cause camera can't make it *^%#$% mind up what it doing ! i am going write nikon see if they off any suggestions this . maybe there some firmware downloaded fix it . i dunno . other than , i am very pleased my purchase would recommend it	1
i purchased this camera after getting junior mint stuck lense cover my cannon . cannon bigger bulkier , but came more bells whistles ( color select , super awesome macro , 6x optical zoom ) . while this camera doesn't all fun extras cannon , it small size , no extending lens knock while shooting or get rained ( or junior mints stuck ) menu easy enough navigate doing manual settings almost do-able novice . other words , there aren't so many extras clogging up menu choices you give up what you trying . while macro cannon better , macro nikon good enough general point shoot colors far more saturated depth . screen nikon also lot larger . cool feature battery . nikon uses li-ion batter which you never remove camera housing . charge camera you simply plug it into dock it comes w/ , or if traveling you bring just cable dock wall use it charge camera . while cannon nice , i'm happy cheaper smaller easier use camera	1
i looking case hold my nikon 5700 - nothing bulky , just something would offer some protection while dragging it around vacation . this case fits bill . it nice quality leather - holds camera snuggly . if i find something wasn't perfect this case , it would camera strap ( one same my 5700 ) doesn't fit nicely case i'd like it . it takes bit arranging , but it fit . this really such non-issue , but i wanted mention it . i keep my camera this case within my larger multi-camera bag home storage travelling airplane ( where my charger tipod kept ) . this small case great taking camera out day trips . such great price - i highly recommend this anyone	1
this case fits camera well , space extra battery several compact flash cards . not buy this case if you use filters . there no extra space large 67mm adapter or filters themselves	1
after reading reviews before i bought this camera , i skeptical because there some very negative feedback well mostly positive . this camera functions very well i am very pleased every aspect it performance -- especially price . rechargable batteries must !	1
i've it several weeks now it seems like great camera . i am still learning new features . i would highly recommend it	1
wonderful affordable housing take your camera places you normally can't! i took my canon s80 down 110 feet got wonderful photos ! my only advice scuba divers buy external strobe bracket . flash point-and-shoot camera not powerful enough give you colorful photos you really want	1
i've used camera snorkerling , protection down colorado river grand canyon last summer . it one those purchases i really feel gives me my money worth ; i would buy it again heartbeat . case very durable , fits neatly standard pelican case . unfortunately , camera wheel control cannot manipulated while inside case . this problem wheel control minimal , generally avoided little planning . wheel control only reason i don't give this case 5 stars	1
this optional charger benefit able charge batteries alpha more quickly than standard charger supplied alpha . it displays amount time left regular or full charge . although it charging bay two batteries , batteries only charged sequentially not simultaneously . one downside unit relatively large , much larger heavier than standard charger	1
camera bag excellent . this great deal getting extra battery you need backup your camera well constructed camera bag uv filter	1
you can't go wrong this bag , it extremely sturdy well-built . quality you expect canon , usual . if you just purchased canon digital slr or planning , i highly recommend getting this . if you kit lens , 58mm filter come handy course extra battery always good . i've already filled it my 4 lenses , notebook pen , rebel xt manual , my filters , two cf cards other accessories like remote trigger xt . i still room left . velcro/pad configuration system great because it doesn't lock you into always carry same set equipment arranged same way . tripod straps pleasant surprise	1
christmas , i received cannon g7 . very nice expensive camera . i not want trust it soft case . this case sturdy , but not hard . it comfortable carry around . easy slide camera out . i like strap camera what i wear around my neck rather than try fit it into case . it comes attachable mini case house battery and/or memory cards . i highly recommend this case	1
canon zr800 camcorder solid little unit plenty features most folks . great price , it surprising canon even included external microphone input ( after all , 90 percent video audio ) . actually , i bought zr800 " deck " play capture mini-dv tapes recorded my prosumer camcorder ( avoiding wear tear expensive cameras ) , but once i tried zr800 i loved it often use it day day use instead hauling around huge camcorders	1
very well made works well field when you taking shots quickly . i noticed better quality light falling my subjects no red eye . i not situation yet test shadow my subject falling further down but it goes reason if flash higher over lens shadow would effected	1
this why sony hot ! this sexy little ( yes its really small size pack cards ) it takes perfect clear crisp pictures battery life long 320mins perfect vacation , make sure get memory stick it though , because w/o it it only holds 15 pics . this my first digital camera i would definitely buy sony again	1
sony w55 followup successful popular w50 . it very good compact camera , easy carry easy use , reasonably priced - so most people happy it . not much changed w50 , which this case good thing ! one change w55 7 mp camera , rather than w50 6mp . honestly , that not big plus , they haven't made sensor catches light any larger . same ( good ) lenses , same size sensor = same ( good ) pictures , but not better . ( though it might help little features like smart zoom . ) obvious change course colors . don't make too much fun ! there 4 dsc-w series cameras our family , colors would kept my mother-in-law taking my sister camera home her . little personalization good thing . internal memory expanded ( 56mb ) , but i've never used internal memory cameras it , so i'm not sure matters much . it might worth knowing how use backup , dozen or two shots if your card full , or you some other problem . controls , menus interface w55 reasonably easy use . example , w55 easy access various scene modes ( twilight , etc ) , some explanation screen what those mysterious little icons mean ( so you might actually use them , since it tells you what they ! ) . if you're new digital photography , there learning curve . but if you've used other cameras much , especially sonys , you pick this up use many features right away . read short introductory guide comes camera , though ! rechargeable battery should easily last you full day shooting - hundreds shots - no problem . ( little wise turning it off when you're not using it ! ) so you probably don't need second battery , unless you're going into woods while . it nice not mess bulky aa rechargeables . also , lithium ion batteries don't memory effect , so don't worry partial recharging . just charge battery each night . so - before getting second battery , try it while see if you need it . but get case - something protect screen , least . fully closed one might help resist rain splashes little , too . you'll also want get memory stick pro duo card - pro cards faster , you need smaller duo size this camera . get 1-2gb card so you don't think running out memory too much - if you shop carefully , you find them so little these days it well worth avoiding running out memory . you might want spare card if you plan travel more than week , or use video mode often - which surprisingly good ( though bit dark ) if set fine , but uses enormous amounts storage setting . you stretch your memory , your hard drive space , using one lower-resolution settings take snapshots . you don't really need 7mp all your photos ! w55 take better photos than those credit-card type cameras tiny lens system - optics always make difference camera . any reasonable person very happy pictures w55 , given size it . camera little slow often take disappointing pictures low light dark situations . try high iso mode low light no-flash situations - picture quality suffers some , but most people find it useful . realistically , no ultra-compact camera work really well situation - if you need often , think something bigger lens bigger sensor . good light always gives best pictures any camera . there limits what you currently expect any ultracompact camera . w55 offers enough controls ( through scene modes program mode ) allow fair amount control over pictures , automatic camera . charger fairly compact rated 100-240v , so while you'll need plug adapter overseas you won't need voltage converter . battery charger little slow , though probably ok . keep this camera charged handy , you'll find you take lot pictures because it easy carry easy use	1
this large hood i doubt there'll any lens glare wide medium zoom positions this thing ! full zoom though , least my nikon coolpix 5700 , there not much hood shielding sides lens glare because lens so far out . i haven't any trouble this , it just observation i made . this hood all rubber except ring containing mounting threads , they're metal , so if you knock it against something likely it won't get damaged , ( hood or what ever it knocks against ) due soft rubber ; ' good idea nikon ' . interior hood ringes molded into it , reduce reflections , i'm sure . only downside thing looks like toilet plunger because its shape size you would not want it if you trying inconspicuous .	1
it worked stated however i dissapointed learn golf professional it cannot used official tournaments assistance slope prohibited !!! price competitive merchandise shipped promptly	1
i love my rangefinder ! i've it since oct . 2006 forgot it home only once . i've trusted my pinseeker over tee box yardage markers , myriad gps in-cart units , sprinker heads usual variety yardage center green course markers 200 , 150 , 100 . i believe what it tells me it highly accurate . i'm reluctant share yardage info my fellow players unless asked , avoid chatty debates responsibility their errant shots . ( you'd surprised ... ) few things aware , flags must clearly visable distant out focus shrub branches interfere laser sensor , low light overcast conditions difficult accurately measure distance lastly , if you've heavily consumed too much coffee or too many martinis night before , shakiness prevail . you may want add tripod your bag . %	1
i bought this rangefinder take myrtle beach golf outing . since we play different course every day , i hoped it would give me true yardages course i hadn't played before . it out performed my expectations . every golfer knows yardages course center green . but some greens 1 2 club lengths more . this rangefinder gave perfect yardages me . this rangefinder three modes operation . you use it hunting first mode , which just gives you yardage any target you aim . second mode pin seeker mode golf . you aim flag press button it gives you yardage flag . third mode pin seeker w/slope mode golf . you also aim flag it gives you distance pin plus or minus slope green(this mode illegal usga tournaments ) . it very helpful off tee . you could aim it fairway bunker or hazard tee you could get yardage would let you know whether you could carry it . i found it very easy operate great product .	1
camera fullfilled mostly all expectations . only anti blur system(super steady shot)was quite disapointing because most moving objects apears blury my other , oldest , olympus digital camera . i really expected more it	1
course this camera not digital slr . since i received it , i taken more pictures one month than i would my slr . i take it everywhere me because .... well because i now .... i loved my rebel but it too bulky vacations fun . i miss features it offered me , but this little guy catches lot more fun ..	1
waterproof case arrived perfect ( new ) condition overnight promised . i especially impressed because it coming me my vacation maui shipped holiday . thanks saving our vacation photos	1
i recently enjoyed two dives hawaii ... one during day one night . underwater case worked very well . i very pleased . i also use case any time i am around beach or near salt water sand order protect camera . if you get case wet , you rinse wipe off lense or you water spots your pictures . course this would true any case . only negatives flash little week since it somewhat obscured case . if you push on/off button too hard it may jam camera on/off button down . it only takes light push turn it off . overall it great product	1
i've camera over year , taken several thousand pictures it . it pretty darn good overall . i've pleased image quality , especially scenery shots . it fall somewhat short portraits people many cases , though . easy use . minor durability problems .	1
i bought this camera my wife christmas after i bought it she talking said she not like hp products . well she opened it christmas said it looked nice . after she took 40 pictures it i could not pry it out her hand crowbar .. it takes great pictures very easy work . she even let me take couple pictures it . so it shows you don't spend lot money get great camera . keep up great work hp ..	1
i've found these batteries last longer perform better than standard brand batteries . delivery great usual	1
product delivered prompt manner received perfect condition	1
i several digital cameras , many brands but i must say casio exilim ex-z600bk one best ultra digital cameras market . pros : fast operationbig , bright lcdgreat bodynice picturescons : no viewfinderno manual controlsadditional comments : lookrating : camera looks it online images . its nice dark , glossy black but doesn't smudge or keep finger prints easily . sizerating : 5/5its very tiny . you hide it clasping your hands . feelrating : 5/5its great feel . buttons small but not awkward . its light too . you hardly feel it yout pocket but its balanced comfortable hold . this camera practically perfect . this honest review . its great value money . i recommend it .	1
i don't think anybody going pretend little casio exilim ex-z600 6.0 mega pixel camera best camera ever built or takes best pictures world . but under $[ ... ] , it hard beat everything advertised . size perfect , one smallest , slimmest cameras made , easily fitting into one [ ... ] pocket , even when enclosed small case . viewing screen probably biggest brightest you'll find , so aiming shooting easy it . range modifications ( size , contrast , sharpness , saturation , etc . ) taking managing pictures seems almost endless , yet various menus camera offers simple navigate . camera docking stand makes downloading pictures one computer well charging up camera snap . moreover , according casio , single charge afford one up 500 or more snaps . picture quality ? it perhaps not absolutely clear well defined , even its maximum six mega pixels , best cameras ; although , fair , best cameras often cost three-to-four times much this one . so , far i'm concerned , i've no complaints , pictures i've taking delight eye . z600 makes picture-taking fun again	1
this must alpha . it fits so well looks great	1
this very easy use , well built housing . i've used it multiple dives 100 feet it met all my expectations . price , it cannot beat . if you dive you need add weight kit canon wwdc1 . without weights housing camera float . i added two plates ( one plate recommended canon ) my housing i find extra weight adds stability . i wish canon would include weight plates , but if you only snorkeling or using this pool weights probably not needed . i only two small gripes . first function selector dial awkward position i found i would often accidentally switch camera movie or playback mode when holding camera . i since learned check mode every time i bring camera my eye . my second gripe there no case camera housing . i'm using neoprene foam wrap i picked up camera store . i would not hesitate buy this housing or other canon housings again	1
one reasons my wife i bought canon this waterproof case . it works very well . it takes 5 minutes get all set up , i'd strongly suggest taking it dry run home before you it field ( except lubing up seal ; save real deal ) . our pictures came out very well camera safe whole time . couple things : first , getting rubber seal out its channel hassle , best two peole , one squeeze seal so it lifts up other pull it away . avoid using fingernails , since you might scratch it . second , it very easy accidentally knock lever back " underwater " mode setting " movie " mode setting . if camera starts shoot movie , that probably what happened . just flip it back keep shooting away	1
it insane spend $180 piece plastic , but it also insane spend $400 camera then need buy disposable cameras when you go scuba diving . this nice design , not too heavy , it job perfectly . i only wish it half price .	1
canon powershot very good camera exception red eye reduction not really work . i read instructions over over againg , but " red eyes " persist .	1
i am unable comment effectiveness product it given my daughter(an accomplished amateur photographer)as gift . i only attest fact product arrived time good condition exactly what my daughter requested her holiday gift wish list	1
while offered remote stylus digital camera , this remote match olympus e-500 digital slr camera . unit reliable , works perfectly e-series cameras , works expected	1
part fun taking group shots digital cameras dance setting timer running into shot . watching blinking light count down . this remote allows me fire off my olympus e500 either 2 or 10 second countdown within group . i actually purchased it make time exposures because it important not physically move cameras " bulb " mode . i not tried this yet , but i'll update review when i . i gave it 4 stars only because it very small unit may easily misplaced . amazon nice price this	1
we used this camera our honeymoon snorkling it great ! pictures little grainy , although i credit silt water more than camera quality since out water shots came out great too . lever front much easier use than push button strap perfect . we bought kodak hawaii when these used up picture quality significantly worse than fuji . we would definitely use these again	1
i am very happy resulting prints this camera . i've used other brands past never such bright colors focus shots . winding mechanism easy use . finally i pictures my diving expeditions remember . it even suited kids over ten use . mine lots fun their own quick snap	1
these anyone budget wants upgrade old pair travel binoculars or uncle fred 1954 hand-me-downs . they * waterproof * ( very important , it easy confuse these lower-quality nikon action range ) fogproof , clear bright images . very solid feel compact full-size porro-prism design . 7x35 version action extreme won highest position cornell ornithology lab 2005 binocular shootout out 15 budget entries - probably because 8x40 not tested . yes , they aren't perfect - higher price get you sharper optics , lighter weights , slightly better handling - but this price only alternative i could find leupold 6x30 yosemite around 25% less - model 6x magnification . i'm not sure why , but many sites don't cover warranty these . you get excellent support nikon usa - 25-year no-fault warranty $10 fix or replace fee original owner . combined low price build quality this could last pair binoculars you ever need buy .	1

i reservations buying this camera after reading few negative reviews citing excessive ' noise ' low light situations certain iso settings . knowing i would mostly using more simplified features majority time , given all generally positive reviews others , i decided give it try . i must say i am very satisfied camera . granted , i generally use normal or simple mode most shots , but used all modes several times since purchasing camera it takes wonderful shots , indoors out , low light bright sunshine . user manual very easy understand gives setting suggestions correct some these noise problems . i not any negative experiences it . i bought it replacement olympus stylus i damaged ski trip although camera great point shoot took nice pictures , this panasonic far better . combine compact size , sturdy build good looks you great camera . i bought leather lumex case amazon sold it bundle it very good quality leather snug fitting so not add bulk compact size . nice item .	1
i found these reviews customers wrote very helpful my pursuit buying digital camera . i looking something small , so i could bring it me wherever i went , something going easy use . i also love color options available becuase i like different . this camera very user friendly , weather you making your way through buttons yourself or reading manual , which actually very easy understand . i haven't used all options camera yet , i basically bought camera order take some snap photos my friends post items ebay . so far , everything success i would recommend this camera anyone who looking camera going user friendly , take great picture without expert	1
i'm very satisfied this product . picture quality could little better , but its features excellent . its dimensions perfect taking everywhere , it very easy use	1
camera works really well we've it now almost 2 years . my wife dropped it road cement floors few times accidentally but it still works ( although exterior banged up bit ) . one person indicated it really hard transfer video pc .. we no problems all using pinnacle studio transfers then copy dvd . ( thru doc station fire-wire	1
this camera fantastic . i also own $3500 sony mini-dv picture quality this camera virtually identical . transfer what you've shot dvd , or just play it right off tape onto your tv you blown away broadcast quality image . it very small , some great easy-to-use features shooting sun , shade , action , etc ., even extreme darkness . built lens cover also convenient . after owning this camera only 5 months though , i got error reported other sony mini-dv " dirty tape head . " well , tape head actually fine but damn message wouldn't go away no matter what i , so i it repaired . i bought it sears but wanted use sony repair after telling them truth i very disappointed , blah blah - $212.00 fix camera i just bought $450.00 not fair - they agreed take camera fix it no charge . ( point sony making effort , i believe , satisfy their customers . ) nonetheless , because problem i , i feel compelled recommend person purchasing this camera go ahead buy sony warranty - directly through sony before 90 day manufacturers warranty up . ( it only $117 3 years you'll piece mind . ) should you buy warranty ? no . things break ? yes . hell , i've plenty stuff break just became useless . point , this camera really awesome worth owning . you charge it without using dock however dock cool transfering your computer or any other source . battery comes it lasts really long too . this camera also analog capabilities which handy transferring old vhs tapes mini-dv	1
i purchased this camera just few weeks ago . i really love sony brand . just few comments though . price servicing standard fee . no matter what you send thats price . it digital camera or your camcorder . these devices opened clean room . these rooms filtered tiny particles like dust or your skin cells not get inside . operators wear those white suits keep all contamination them selves . this not slappys tv vcr repair we dealing . any foreigh material getting inside or your ccd dammage camera you don't want . keep mind these rooms cost millions dollars build maintain . if you worried then get warranty . any company charges around same price . check other companies . kodak charges much just open camera up . if you experiencing problems any electronic device out box return it or swap it out . they cannot test every single unit . usually they test several out batch . so if your unit not operating your expectations then all means its your money go take care it ! aside , i'm glad my powermac came firewire cable i needed camera . several years it just drawer . manuel not explain fully it required transfer video tape using this . ( least mac users ) . taking video easy transfering it mac simple . camera comes video editing software but i just used imovie idvd make my dvd vcd . since i already toast mac it easy burn movies disc . otherwise stick software included . those pining not memory card included you not missing much . quality pictures movies you take card not noteworthy . you need plenty light , photos very grainy photo mode memory stick not high megapixel rating , videos chopy . so other than just taking small images possibly keep reference this feature useless . camera video out port camera itself so you leave docking station computer when wanting connect tv just use av cable alone camera . i not hear any motor noises recorded tape . though it make some noises when turning unit . menu system fairly easy navigate easy button makes it " easy " anyone pick up camera shoot . remember you not getting professional camera this consumer use not all features functionality $ 2,000 -$ 3,000 model .	1
i compared several digital photo frames before deciding this one . i managed get one these off website $110 , it best among three i . i digital spectrum 5 " photo frame which could play music video all but looks like toy resolution poor limited viewing angles . second one i radio shack - optimus - it 7 " but photo display same 5 " 7 " horizontal not diagonal . ( it like widescreen format but when you display normal picture , it would only display black bars side . optimus fantastic resolution viewing angles but it not accept cf cards not play videos . finally , i settled royal 8 " . price - i think it best terms value function among three . pros royal pf80 : ( 1 ) accepts cf , sd , mmc , ms ; ( 2 ) plays avi video ( minus sound ) , ( 3 ) fantastic resolution viewing angles ; ( 4 ) 8 " diagonal screen big enough seen across room ; ( 5 ) comes remote ; ( 6 ) removable silver frame but there not extra bezel boxthe cons : ( 1 ) no speakers no sound output ; ( 2 ) ac wire little short ; ( 3 ) setup not fully plug play . you need select few buttons before it would play , ( 4 ) build still plastic but least it painted like photoframe thus , not look like toy . quality comparable westinghouse 8 " sold bestbuy but half price !	1

this product rugged forgiving . accurate +/- 1 ft ., this absolute must all serious bowhunters . lightweight easy use , i find only one minor design flaw . it designed right-handed use slightly cumbersome those who choose use it left-handed hunters ( i am ) . even this minor design flaw , i still am very satisfied this unit would not hesitate recommend it others . most encounters under 50 yards ease use accuracy critical elements hunt . i harvested nice elk this year 52 yards using this unit . thanks bushnell	1
i don't like pink so i bought blue bag . i bought black one , but it so skimpy i returned it prayed until this one arrived . i no trouble amazon crediting me return , either . it so cute ! i'm too old " cute , " but i kept it because i needed case my new hp r717 . it small , yet padded enough trust your camera cushioned if you drop it . i dropped my camera it not injured . it little pouch inside store extra battery my camera , not big aa batteries , but flat type come my r717 . i recommend this little bag , or pink one , even if you don't like pink ... or blue . they well cushioned snug , but not too snug you think they tear . sturdy nice shoulder straps magnet closures	1
i bought c-533 version printer dock 3 , i love this outfit ! small , lightweight , takes great pictures ! my only two complaints , number one ; cartridge/paper kits hard come locally , when i find them , they outragiously high price . number two ; i run older windows 98 computer , software windows 98 not incuded . i download it , after download , it complicated set up , contact tech support find name hidden driver file so i could locate it install it . i realize windows 98 becoming system past , but there many these systems still out there .	1
very easy use . got it my mom christmas . she love it	1
this far one greatest gifts ever received greatly enjoye	1
camera defintely worth amount they charging it . my daughter just loves it . she always taking pictures , all time .	1
i bought this battery back up one came my camera i am pleasantly surprised how long it stays charged . i use my camera almost everyday i've only change it twice . i highly recommend it	1
if you go remote places , you need least one extra battery your camera . this price ( used ) , i'd even buy three . even though this rechargable lasts longer than aa batteries , you lose lot battery charge when transferring images source ( computer ) or viewing them lcd . you might figure 125-150 picutres one battery , but video use even more	1
outing park my nieces , i shot 5 rolls film . i used several different film types : kodak gold 200 , fuji superia x-tra 400 , fuji superia x-tra 800 , fuji color slide film . far , best pictures fuji 400 speed film . bam !! colors just jump out grab you . great skin tones . grains this film superb when enlarged 8x10 . i am looking forward trying fuji 100 200 speed films	1
this camera i use it works great ! i surprised how well it records video too ! it very easy adjust camera environment you photographings . zoom excellent doesn't seem drain batteries much . i would recommend this camera amateur or professional .	1
this only camera you ever need ! i mine 1.5 years not only pictures great but i use 2gb memory card video quality amazing !!! i take video , load unto my computer dvd family watch less than hour ( if you can't wait just plug cord hookup your tv watch video straight camera ) . i retired my digital sony handycam ( which great video camera ) . i used this camera extensively 1.5 years traveling china , europe us - no problems - friends family amazed quality pictures	1
i've this product over month used it extensively during my vacation business trips . dslr novice , i enlisted advice two my very experienced friends . although canon nikon lines bit standard , i think pentax k100d where money . it stacks up both nikon d40/50 canon d3 quite nicely terms picture quality . it nicer grip feel , my opinion , nikon d40 image shake reduction godsend during those critical low-light , no-flash picture taking opportunities ! i would highly recommend this camera any novice who not already own set lenses either other two manufacturers . great camera great features killer price .	1
this camera performing flawlessly provides much higher quality results than kodak p850 it replaced . built-in anti-shake must feature , which limits dslr field dramatically . i see no reason buy expensive anti-shake lenses such nikon canon want you get . camera anti-shake 99% users superior solution . i concerned battery life aa solution , but using sanyo eneloop rechargeables worked out great . these batteries don't high self-discharge rate which normally associated nimh batteries , so you leave camera sitting few weeks still ready go	1

prior review decrying aiptek/macintosh incompatibility flat wrong . mplayer plays aiptek asf ( mpeg4 ) files perfectly . i suspect there other programs would job well , but haven't researched it . mplayer free , took me all 10 minutes find install . download happy . fwiw , today i bought similar aiptek pvr ( no optical zoom , half price sale major chain ) . i intend use it skiing , where i don't want risk more expensive camcorder or deal additional weight bulk . purchasing aiptek , i expecting very basic vcr quality , that what my camera delivers small inexpensive package . build quality seems entirely adequate this class product . user interface very easy pick up . my view , this useful versatile device . especially when paired mac . :o	1
i recently purchased rebel t2 camera body only after my canon eos rebel 2000 gave its " last gasp " . i canon user since 1979 ae-1 ( i still ) . i liked fact t2 body plugged immediately into two ef lenses i owned ( 28-80mm 75-300mm ) , which protected my previous investments . i taking pictures within seconds opening package loading batteries . although i my sights set digital rebel some point soon , you just can't beat quality traditional 35-mm film photoprocessing . upgrade over eos rebel 2000 , lcd located camera back easier read . also , t2 seems more " solid " me , but lighter weight . i took older eos rebel 2000 me couple 75-mile backpacks ( which probably led its early demise ) , so i now new-found respect lighter design . final note , i also appreciated ease ordering via amazon.com . there plenty web sites offering same canon t2 camera back , including those which would saved me few dollars . but none long-standing relationship i amazon over past several years	1
i looked digital cameras months - literally - before i just decided lug around 35 mm slr . everyone probably already knows , megapixels matter whole lot when you're talking blowing picture up larger size . what great film unless picture taken out focus , or bad light , you use negative blow something up quality really doesn't start go down until you're making huge prints . ( how huge exactly i don't know , but biggest i've blown up around 4x4 feet , still no trouble . ) prints i've gotten out this camera so far stellar . ( i use fuji film -- i think it better than kodak , even though kodak better commercials . give it try ! )the camera itself not too heavy , granted , it not convenience tiny digital camera , but it not bad i'd expected carry it around all day . neck strap nice , manual actually easy comprehend . i like camera buttons lot it features body -- it seems complicated first , but once you know how use features , they're much easier access than they would if you scrolling through menu . t2 seems worth hundred or so more dollars than you would pay very similar rebel k2 canon . one thing - make sure you take batteries out if you're not going using it week or more . it seems like they go dead if they're camera , even if it off	1
i love this camera . it handy , goes my purse everywhere . sure it isn't canon rebel or remotely like it , but it fast fast fast , holds charge , takes great wide angle shot takes superb macros . i don't use movie feature but it it . there lot offer this little camera . i people stop me all time ask what brand it . buy it happy :	1
this my fifth digital camera , i like it best far . it also cheapest . it my first wide-angle my first silver-not-black : someone else said , i don't see how i would ever go back non-wide-angle after this ; but i wish mine black . i noticed colors faded fluorescent light , but macro it excellent -- much better than more expensive camera i already bought macro purposes ( canon . ) i also love battery , which seems last forever . i bought replacement lenmar battery which also great , cheap , but it got some bad reviews because it described wrong model camera , not fx-01 . ( if you read customer reviews , you figure out which one right one you . ) i problems understanding display , which shows options don't correspond any place camera you select options . ( i guess i should look manual . ) also , i don't like software decided not download it all . i bought this because i wanted camera made computer company much camera company , , i wanted it work . also , someone sent me email history leica , how they saved lot jews concentration camps . other nice thing this camera i use it lot more because i carry it me every day : it tiny battery always works , so why not ? graininess , my desktop pics look fine , i would not raving this camera if it not very easy take good pics -- but i admit i haven't used it printed pics so far	1
it works advertised . it ( me anyway ) only charge kodak battery pack ! i shoved some nice high end lithions it would not charge them . oddly camera dock my old dx4900 charge almost anything	1
my friends similar products they paid up 3x more . quality very good ... easy use ... such great gift almost any occasion	1
i purchased this camera my 5 year old grandson . it small enough handle large enough hold steady during exposer . general operation this camera very simple easy use . image doesn't stay window very long after exposure made , but it easy preview later	1
pro's:no recording media change , long record time . small lightweight . con's:for price , i can't think any . i think some people seem forget this model considered budget hd camcorder . you not going get " brodcast quality " video out it . you not going get good low light performance . what you get affordable , compact , decent hd camcorder shoe-string budget . nothing more . you paying convenience not change tapes or dvds , bottom line . i've mine now 9 hours so far i've only test shooting it low-light conditions . auto results less than exceptable . if you take little time learn manual controls then you get satisfactory results . there some " noise " ( grainy picture ) but again , this " bottom barrel " camcorder . i've read many reviews this device ( other everio models around this price range ) people all complain poor picture quality i just want say last time ... it budget hd camcorder . yes , i know i'm repeating myself but i want put this issue bed . if you want really nice picture quality , pick up one sony new hi-def hd camcorders . mmmmmm ... might set you back $1200 . people complained mod file . idiots . thats all i got say . included software converts it mpeg2 you . duh !?! no time i my ' test video ' shot , downloaded , converted , edited using windows movie maker . please keeep mind this first camcorder i've ever bought . this first time i've edited video my computer ! also , format hard drive before you begin record . some people complained picture quality worse than web cam . through my countless hours searching " truth " , i came conclusion this may why . they don't even mention until page 39 manual . one most frustating things i've my life research read reviews camcorders . geez , what worm . i'm trying make this blunt possible next guy who reads this shopping camcorder so he doesn't get stuck internet every night week half trying find out truth this thing . " don't listen complainers . they didn't know what they doing " . it budget hd camcorder ! so far i'm very pleased this product quality thus far more than exceptable my needs . record i'm lighting technician/designer audio/visual company some knowledge video technology , but limited hands-on camera experience	1
this camcorder great ! it small , very light . it easy use . only thing i don't like extended battery sticks out back camera so far . even battery it came looks too big .	1
i sony hd camera professional work it here there but i would not able it wihout wide angel lens . there so much 30 mm lens this lens explands possibilities 100fold . next time though , i'll buy high grade lens . this thing not going last much	1

i've this camcorder week now i think it works great .. except touch screen feature . takes little getting used .. especially when accessing special features ( such fader effects ) while filming . digital still quality poor when recording directly memory stick .. but same images taken still prerecorded tape much clearer . all all it good product .. just takes some getting used	1
pros : compact , lightweight , portability , easy use , big screen , good reproductioncons : microphone sensitive wind , getting used not viewfinder , bad low light performance . summary : i picked this camera upgrade my old canon zr10 . first reason i chose it small size portability . good light conditions , this little beast its best shots , but low light conditions this camera disapointed me ( specially compared mi old zr10 ) . please don't buy it if you plans use it stills shots because it low resolution . included handycam station all ports ( firewire , usb , power , video ) you need conect it . big touch screen must , because screen only way access camera controls ( besides some them edge screen ) . you camera more characteristics better image quality same price , but if your concern size portability this your best choice world mini dv format	1
i am advanced amateur photographer . love this camera results it offer price . very impressed results . brought nikons , returned it . 4 nimh rechargable batteries , it run weeks takes good amount time get drained . i dont use lcd review my pictures till i complete shoot day . normally i shoot canon 10d dslr . i carry canon a620 all time emergency situations . love self-timer , other manual options , colors mode .. etc . its really playful camera truly great results . i always shoot iso-50 keep image noise low . so , i recommend same . video shoot output ok . you cannot zoom while shooting video though . this camera really tough my kid dumped it several times ground i not seen any problem	1

this best camera i've ever saw my daughter loves it .	1
purchased this unit new $160 . good performance - little practice , getting readings well over 800 yards , even bright sunlight . also like fact it uses standard aaa cells . housing design leaves bit desired - it bulky , battery cover not very secure . see losing cover easily . not ergonomic more recent models . overall , $160 rangefinder genuine 800 yard performance , good deal	1

i bought this camera take me disney world . i digital slr but didn't want use it this trip it little heavy carrying all day - just wanted small camera which would go my pocket . i am certainly not disappointed my purchase - i took over 400 photos only deleted 20 them . majority pictures sharp excellent color . i used optical zoom quite lot - this worked really well . i disabled digital zoom . all pictures taken highest quality so i could edit later if necessary . i took lot night shots firework displays - some pics weren't so great - but others very good . i would certainly recommend this anyone wanting convenient , easy use camera . menu easy navigate i found batteries lasted long time . it nice able buy regular aa batteries use emergency . i spent lot time evenings scrolling through all my pictures , so batteries really put test ! i like viewfinder this camera not one - but it really wasn't problem even shots i took when i couldn't really compose image worked well	1
we'd ordered different one taking forever ship so we ordered this one instead . we love it !!! it takes great pictures !!! easy use !!! my favorite part when buying ink paper , you get enough both know exactly how many pictures you print out	1

i just bought this camera before making trip disney i absolutely love it . my pictures just beautiful . they very clear very sharp . this really nice camera anyone	1
because low price these batteries , i expecting some them may duds . however , i am pleased all them seem work . i these batteries month , so i cannot comment their long term reliability . also , i not tested whether they really 2650mah or not . i used them mainly my mp3 player portable speakers some battery operated foot warmers they worked well . one thing though , ' shoulder ' battery positive end seems very slightly highers or ' nib ' little bit shorter than most batteries . this means these batteries may not make good connection 100% electronics . i this problem only cheap portable radio able solve it sticking little bit aluminum foil battery contact . most electronics not this issue	1
i am accustomed using larger point shoot zoom . this sleek pocket sized point shoot gives exceptionally sharp pictures . it focuses very swiftly i would suppose due leica lense . battery life good . i notice photos tend calibrate little blue range . i like little more zoom . overall , i like it very much	1
i rebel xt lenses , flashes , etc . my wife wanted small easy use camera so i got her this her birthday . she got it last night up all night taking pictures around house experimenting wide range options available . first she thought camera too complicated but after staying up all night using it , she living it . professional photographer , this camera great i may steal it events quick way take some pictures . it all features super resolution make great companion ( long she lets me take it ) highly recommended anyon	1
this replaces my 2.1 mp digital elph i use when i don't want carry my big slr ( digital rebel xt series lens ) . positive : instant start-up , menu navigation zoomscreen quality comparable video ipodcomfortable intuitive button placementstrong flash ( camera size)modern/traditional camera aesthetics ( great looking)acceptable battery lifecamera operation obviously well thought outlow price what you getnegative : poor low-light shooting without flashlots noise iso more than 200no image stabilizationzoom ring spring little too strongplastic battery doorthis perfect pocket camera if you care more ease-of-use , aesthetics , size , price than trying capture print-worthy photo . overall i'm very pleased this camera , but only because i slr capture important moments/places . think great myspace photos rather than great family christmas cards .	1
pro photographer here . using so many different digital cameras .. because i am very picky . this camera fantastic . great looking sexy design . simple easy use . fantastic looking pictures .. fast easy small size fits your pockets . great micro function . great movie mode . sharp accurate color pictures .. best compact digital camera market . well always new things coming out surprise me but least now/so far this best one market right now- point shoot/compact camera catagory . canon makes great camera ..	1
i similar issue reviewer ... my z740 lcd screen failed few months ago . i turn camera all screen shows solid white . little eye-piece viewfinder still displays fine , pictures videos still come out fine , but i can't use lcd screen my viewfinder any more ... which one biggest reasons i bought camera ... others online this problem , but i can't find anyone who gotten it resolved . my camera well out warranty , so i no hope kodak fixing it . otherwise though , it great camera ... very impressive actually . i just wish it hadn't died after year half occasional use ... : -	1
i bought this camera last summer . i taken enough pictures put up review now . i love this camera ! pure simple , it met exceeded my expectations . pictures it takes very nice , sharp , focused , crisp . it so many features you play around . i probably only used half them more than once . it very nice lcd display , or you take pictures through traditional peep hole . view screen it always tell you , which mode you , gives you nice centering square , what picture you , etc . zoom it awesome , although i haven't used much date . you take close up shots flowers , insects , etc ., it still get everything just right . three my favorite features though : option take video clips , fact you shoot photographs black white or sepia color , which gives your pictures real antique or historical feel depending what you going . it even let play around shooting night picturs , or different landscapes near far . when you print out pictures off your computer , if you any kind decent printer you almost shocked how detailed crisp picture . i would almost swear it better than film pictures . i couldn't stop looking it , because i so amazed ! person like me mainly takes normal snapshots most time , i don't know what else i could ask camera ! moreover , you can't go wrong price . it little more expensive than other cameras ? sure ! however , features it it well worth it . it isn't exorbinent begin . way , you people like shop around best price like me , i went 3-4 different stores my area cameras like this one , best price i found here amazon . if you buy it , you love it , end story .	1
good product but not suitable medium format cameras slr cameras large telephoto lenses	1
i went camera store look tripods . i noticed this one , it went very high which main trait i looking . it felt strong , not flimsy like many other tripods display . panning smooth you flip head its side vertical pictures . it seemed like perfect tripod except price ... $80 . i checked it out amazon find it only mere 40 something . i havn't used it yet , but i know i'll very happy it .	1
money you cant beat it . it not pro lense . it doesnt pro lense price . first you need learn what your doing . f/4- 5.6 isn't low light lens . you need use flash . outdoors it fine . its lense not photographer . if you dont know how use it , it can't teach you . if you , you'll love it	1
i wanted get decent start digital slr , but hobby camera , i can't justify spending $1000 one lens . this zoom lens gives me sharp results good light , passable but grainy results low light . if you learn strong weak points this lens use it accordingly , you won't disappointed . if you aren't willing learn work your lens , you probably won't happy high-dollar ones , either . ;) this makes good partner 18-55mm kit lens d-50 . if you're up spending extra money , skip other lenses get 18-200mm nikkor $1000 . good choice this category 70-300mm nikkor , also available amazon	1
if u like me likes take pictures places visited like capture atmosphere place this lens . pictures not perfect but they good enough	1
i love this camera . i bought it my trip paris . i found it very easy use . one feature i didn't realize it video sound . i found very useful . i bought 2gb memory card go camera . one it comes doesn't hold many pictures . software easy install use . not really small enough pocket but still great camera budget	1
this my 3rd digital camera i bought this one supplement my larger 10x zoom camera . this one fits nicely into pocket or small camera bag easily take it all events or travel . i've found it takes nice photos indoors when flash used .... even when cats or dogs i'm shooting moving around . i've felt life battery set pretty good , but i've using nice rechargeable ones . definitely get set 4 , then you 2 use 2 backup set . settings pretty easy figure out change 99% my photos taken " auto " setting came out pretty good . others indicated , indoors - without flash - produce blurry photos , but that nature almost all cameras , not unique this model . glad i bought it would highly recommend it	1
this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . even close-up photos turn out great . you would think this camera more than 3.2 megapixels ! you get much larger memory card though , case most digital cameras	1
great design firm body protects camera against bumps knocks . i saw only two problems : first , carrying strap too soft gets wrapped up itself . second , case not permit installation tube uv filter camera . it simply isn't deep enough . you need both these items order protect lens . it would simple redesign fix issue .	1
i bought this case my cybershot dsc-w1 . camera fits beautifully into case . i especially like shoulder / neck strap detachable . one thing indistinguishable photo : there two zippers run up each side case . they connected smaller strap ( seen photo - much like wrist strap ) you pull zip or unzip both sides once . side zippers not run top or bottom case , so there less danger your camera accidently falling out when you removing case . color case less blue-siver , shown pic . it more taupe-silver , but it looks quite fly brushed metal plate front . please note mini-pouch not fit inside camera case . however , it velco flap which allows it attach securely shoulder / neck strap . i attached mine smaller wrist strap , but probably end up storing it my purse . i easilly fit pair replacement batteries their plastic case , two memory cards into mini-pouch . i would given five stars if mini-pouch fit inside camera case - thus my 4.5 star rating	1
really nice camera bag compact digital cameras . this bag hold most accessories compact digital camera owner want carry either used shoulder strap or belt loop	1

if you looking good small camera , no intentions ansel adams , this good camera choice . i travel alot , this camera perfect because it fit my pockets or small purse . it also takes pretty good pictures	1
i love this camera . it handy , goes my purse everywhere . sure it isn't canon rebel or remotely like it , but it fast fast fast , holds charge , takes great wide angle shot takes superb macros . i don't use movie feature but it it . there lot offer this little camera . i people stop me all time ask what brand it . buy it happy :	1
good product but color not so attracticed	1
i got this camera month ago my birthday . when i opened it up i astounded . camera tiny extremely thin , yet it giant bright screen back . i'm artist i like my camera all times , making this one perfect since it fits my pocket many other things . there many pros few cons . first off other reviews people said flash week sound playback quiet . these both completely false , both outstanding what i seen other cameras . feature wise it decent . it lot good themes taking pictures certain things , its extremely comprehensive . changing simple settings like flash on/off macro mode extremely good easily visible screen . one quible i would lack extra specific adjustments getting picture just right . if your not big time photographer features far enough . now picture quality etc . first off this camera rediculous number pixels its size . this both good bad . lots pixels means lots detail , right lighting this camera get some very crisp shots . however low lighting pictures blurry if you blow up pictures big enough you see little bloches color . most part this no problem especially if you proficient photoshop . video recording excellent quality completely replace your video camera ( aside zoom ) . which reminds me , zoom isn't great , but there so much detail photo you just crop it down it looks just good . conclusion this camera accomplishes all following- wow your friends , fits anywhere , easy use , takes good big pictures , takes great video , generaly great dea	1
camera one best considering price size it . only problem i found it not light , so you need buy external one , if not all shots you night very dark	1
i totally love this camera . very easy use beautiful pictures . perfect scrapbook give away grandparent pictures	1
main reasons i bought this ( now discontinued ) model : it 3 ccd chips ( great color detail , especially outdoors ) , it size feel , fact it accessory shoe mic input . i use it family videos , short videos our church youth group . clarity great , sound good such small camcorder . backlight compensation feature works great ! battery life average industry , i recommend buying bigger energizer brand battery . only gripes i : it doesn't true night-vision like sony handycam , you can't shoot true widescreen ( though there " widescreen mode " , but it loses resolution . bottom line : best features lowest price i could find market . too bad panasonic discontinued this model , replaced it 1 ccd model without mic input !	1
it great , light little camera . very handy field work . i'm very pleased it . it take still photos . i find usb 2.0 video transfer very useful : saves me trouble buying installing firewire card . it not get full 5 stars because , unlike many , if not all , previus models same line , it not include hand remote control . too bad , because it woould mayor bonus . friend mine gs65 model , which less megapixels ' such , but include remote . heck , my manual talks remote everything , kinda throws it your face bit . oh well , it still very good camera price , i mean , 3 ccds , that just too cool	1
indie filmmaker here , always looking out better camera ! sony hdv series astonishing technologydon't let people tell you footage " too compressed " ---- technically , it , but once it gets screen , it looks stunning ! i haven't much filming this camera ---- but i seen its footage edited its footageboth television computer monitor , i impressed its ' look ' ---- very detailed extremely clearediting breeeeeze this footage ! i edited final cut pro could composite 5 layers all above each other , each different opacity , fcp real time engine kept up without render ! thus , compressed footage makes editing easy - but sony managed make beautiful picture out this stuff toofor indie filmmakers out there ---- test one out before purchasing ..... i find sony hdv most clear look out there --- emulating beautifully shot nfl game hd ..... but cinematic looks , i still may stick panasonic dvx100 , there more cinema feel onehope helpshappy buying !!!	1
addendum 3/30 : correct guy correcting me 2 reviews above . regular mini-dv mode widescreen , there definitely wider picture . focus one item switch modes , you see picture get wider . hd mode anamorphic 4:3 - stretched fit 16x9 , but keeps aspect ratio so everything doesn't look stretched . i've run tests know what i am saying . you ? recently shot my uncle wedding widescreen , played video back his widescreen tv . aspect ratio image accurate not stretched . yes , this shoots widescreen , but not hi-def same time . original review : my first " prosumer " camcorder i ever owned i love it . color reproduction phenomenal great features . few caveats may scare away people looking something more , but this more very high end consumer item . not novice , but someone more shooting talent than average person . if you want true hd professional camera , spend 15+ grand stop knocking this one . bother me regular mini-dv record true 16:9 mode . while hd mode anamorphic 4:3 . ( stretched fit 16:9 ) wide-angle lens fix $500 more . but if you transferring regular dvd , you still shoot mini dv widescreen because dvd doesn't record hd . so , unless you transferring hd dvd , like blu-ray , you best consumer/prosumer widescreen camcorder available . rated 3lux , low light doesn't harm this baby much . i find accessories pricey too , but cost you pay when you go prosumer . everything else beginners amateurs . tip : get long life battery . sony 970 recommended longest life , but 960 served me well days shooting/standby plenty time left over . get light too ! i mention women love men big camcorders ? {: -pnp-970 battery : http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/b0006g3bhw/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/002-0715528-1432846?%5fencoding=utf8v=glanc	1
after six months use it one best handycam i ever tried , you just need get extra battery course touch screen protector . update : now it almost 18 month this handycam , i love it , its simple so my kids use it easy button professional you still go deeper setting set it . it worth every penny i paid it	1
this flash powerful blast many bonus controls . like three second flashing option , where you negotiate all shadow lighting options before actually shoot your first shot	1
i never avid photographer , preferring much more experience enjoy moment rather than fumbling around camera trying get perfect shot . this camera , its ease use great picture quality , gives me best both worlds . i've it over 6 months now very pleased it . only reason i give it 4 stars instead 5 one piece misleading advertising . camera touted running aa batteries , but when you read manual you learn " standard " aa alkaline batteries not recommended . you must use lithium or rechargeable batteries instead . this probably reason many reviewer complaints battery life camera shutting itself off - it just doesn't run alkalines . but i've no problems running it lithiums rechargeables . i also can't make any recommendations software one way or other . i custom setup installed usb drivers only , which work fine . i use adobe photoshop elements my editing am thrilled results	1
i love this product . i'm not much camera person . but it takes great pictures . two other people i know both it they love it too .	1
this camera sure give you new photo experience . although it takes little practice get perfect photos , result definitely something you never experienced ! unmatched other cameras , fisheye lens become favorite mine . i'd recommend this camera anyone wanting get some interesting beautiful pictures	1
this camera pretty basic cheap film camera , but it takes surprisingly good photos . i love how some my photos came out it , i caught hot air balloon show , fish eye view makes it look totally surreal . this definitely worth money	1
let me explain what this really because i buy it understand . maybe me :) ok what this basically " pull " you back into camera more . so when you taking picture you actually see outlining lens , making it circle picture . not what i expecting but its interesting i am new " real " photography so i am not sure if this usefull or really good thing but i just wanted make it clear what it really so you not spend money buy it :	1
i'm anal lot things . this item makes me feel good it . i keep all my spare batteries it my backpack . i always batteries , i always no which ready go which dead . if you carry camera or any electronic device uses aa or aaa batteries you needing get them out bottom your bag or purse , this what you'll need	1
i've serious amateur occassional professional photographer over 40 years . my experience spans early slr entries up present . i've also long-time nikon groupie . my opinion , they manufacture best equipment this type available , though recent years quality provided few tops seems closing gap . i mean canon specifically . said , i'm type photographer drags around select few lenses couple bodies so i mix match lenses films . speaking which ( films ): i am not technology-averse . i love idea digital . i shoot home movies direct dvd sony equipment . i also scan my 35mm negs/prints using canon 9950f ( excellent print scanner ) or nikon 5000ed coolscan ( best slide/neg scanner)to digital files further action photoshop . however , said , i still shoot my stills 35mm film . several reasons : current digital camera bodies simply not afford flexibility speed , sensitivity , or versatility film . i hate fact cmos sensors effectively double focal length all my lenses ( currently only one exception , canon , i think ) . i'm recording my images only currently available archival medium : film . yes , i know bytes bits supposedly archival . but 50 years now , your dvd still going readable any then-current technology ? remember beta ? or 8 track tapes ? however , daguerre matthew brady prints(both 19th century ) still . mine -- yours if you shoot film . said , few years back , i decided my eyes no longer afforded me luxury manual focus i decided go auto-focus capabilities now available , i stuck nikon bought my first n-80 . i am so happy i ! this camera simply outstanding every way , affording you ability use it simple point-and-shoot if you wish ( due its extremely fast sharp system coupled matrix metering system , on-board pop-up flash ) , well option take direct control over every aspect creative photo process intuitive easy-to-use systems . i liked it so much couple years later i bought second backup system enhancer ( meaning two loaded bodies different lens/film combinations ) . additional benefit current fad seems toward digital bodies , n-80 prices gone down significantly . interesting phenomenon merits quick observation : order get same quality resolution available good film/camera body/lens combination far cropping or enlargment capability goes , you spend neighborhood $3000 $4000 body-only camera , you're still limited duplication film sensitivity . try duplicating 3000asa film speed digital camera . good luck ! you'll blasted " noise " image ; what we used call " grain " film , i.e. loss resolution sharpness . i'm finally making move up my next big camera purchase . guess what ? it nikon f-5 . film body . what tell you ? buy this camera ! it great !	1
this my 2nd digtial slr . film days , i using nikon products . my initial foray into digital photography , i switched canon ( 10d ) just see what other side fence . after three years , i switched back nikon because nikon products suits me better . no , this not " canon sucks , nikon rules " review . one thing i learned digital photography you should really decide not camera body itself , but whole lineup ... including lenses accessories . me , nikon lens line-up works me better , not because canon worse line-up ... i'm sure lot photographers find canon line-up much more sensible . now , camera itself : i've own this camera over year sold number stock images using this camera . suffice say , i'm very satisfied its performance ; i'm not going re-iterate praises that said previous reviews . what i am compelled say not-so-great characteristics this camera : iso400 above , it not very forgiving underexposure . if you not nail exposure , even raw you see noise shadow area when you try correct exposure raw software converter . this why you hear lot whining d200 owners regarding " noise . " most them don't nail exposure first time try adjust raw converter ... then bam ! noise shadows . auto white balance becomes iffy well underexposure ; everything becomes biased magenta underexposure ; this very hard correct even post-processing . nikon creative lighting system i believe feature makes nikon little better than canon artificial lighting exposure . basically , nikon designed their flash system multiple flashes mind . nikon auto-focus engine better than most canon folks tend evangelize . afs lenses i'm positive it fast any canons . if there one thing i would like change future iterations this product : i need more than one cross-type af points ! newer pentax dslr nine out its 11 af points ! this beneficial more accurate focus . so my recommendation ... if you already nikon lenses , thinking if it worth price difference jump d40/d50/d70 . it unequivocably " yes . " if you're just starting dslr system , i say look closely what nikon/canon/pentax/olympus/leica/sigma offer whole system then decide . if you decide nikon , you won't yearning own higher d2-series model this camera ; it almost same feature set lower price	1
ergonomics : perfect . d200 not completely rubber-encased . there rubber where your hands need hold it , plastic where your hands rarely touch it . hand grip comfortable nicely concave where tips your fingers dig . battery door memory card door made plastic , hinge-pinned . simple slide latch opens battery door .... some warned latch could easily ( accidentally ) tripped . memory card door latch , however , uses more secure 45 degree pivoting latch . usb 2 video out/dc-in doors made flexible rubber , these doors extend into body camera hinges themselves . english language operating manual work art . each operating concept alpha ' numerically numbered pictoral diagram , page where function explained perfect english . reader quickly catch how this well thought out manual organized . i like depth field preview , mirror lock-up , multiple-exposure capability . continuous servo autofocus better job than any human following focusing any moving object . if you old manual-focus , film-based nikon slr lenses ' 70 ' 80 , except few rare exceptions , fit d200 . all these positive attributes remind me best , most highly-evolved film camera slr . no wonder so many photographers won over digital media .	1
i bought this camera back-up my d2x so i wouldn't change lenses much trip i'm taking alaska this summer . well let me tell you , d200 18-200mm vr lens incredible . it fast , quiet pleasure use . i've read forums 18-200 little soft . so far i totally disagree , pictures i've taken very sharp . i wish this would available when i bought my d2x . if it , i would own two d200 instead one each . highly recommended !!	1
i love this little records . it light takes great movies . great audio video quality . haven't used it enough give expert opinion , but so far , i am really happy my purchase . my child loves it too . she wiz it	1
i using this camera several weeks lots different conditions : indoors , outdoors , action , stills , etc . overall , it great camera if you looking good video performance , acceptable still performance video camera , no tapes , incredibly small size which truly fit your pocket . i not any dark video issues mentioned above . i owned many previous minidv cameras including jvc , canon elura , panasonic 3ccd , sony dcr-pc1000 . my eye , video this camera produces video good others terms sharpness color accuracy . i tested it side-by-side sony ( most recent model those shown ) , it performed same my eye sony video , although color little more accurate panasonic , still images noticeably better . i concerned getting mpeg2 camera thinking compression would cause artifacts trouble action video . i no problems either . real reason i tried this camera all above cameras broken after couple years use due broken tape handling mechanism , i thrilled idea tapeless camera ! battery lasts much longer due not drive tape , startup time great since it doesn't get tape across recording heads after you switch it . i also prefer no hard drive durability battery life issues , none hard drive cameras even close this size . now trade-offs you make this camera . first i thought it didn't go very wide-angle which disapponting ( 44mm 35mm equivalent , i think ? ) , but i tested it side-by-side sony it nearly identical , i never noticed lack wide angle sony . also , mpeg2 format bit pain . i use final cut express imovie mac , neither reads mpeg2 directly . said , there free utility which seems very good called streamclip , or you buy $20 add-on your qt player play convert mpeg2 , but it still extra step process . i believe premiere not support it either . just aware it not compatible many editing apps ubiquitous minidv conversion step required . only other camera i seriously considered ( after ruling out tapes hard drives ) sanyo xacti vpc-hd1a , which also sd-based camera . despite 5mp still image resolution , most video reviews it extremely negative . some surmised this really still camera core , marketed video camera . furthermore it not optical image stabilization , which i consider near-must such small cameras if you want smooth video . it indeed record hd , but least one review said video quality poor enough it didn't really matter . it indeed record mpeg4 , though , which natively read imovie . so if you don't mind significantly larger camera tapes , there may more compelling options like sony hdr-hc3 which records hd , or perhaps one hard-drive models . but if you're looking tapeless video camera , especially sd-based one which takes truly high quality video , this appears only real choice out there moment ( nov 2006 )	1
this second camcorder i owned , i love it . its smple easy use , picture quality whole lot better than my old higher end samsung mini dv , very easy transfer work your videos , very compact , very good camera would suggest any friend	1
i like this charger lot , yet recently lost one while traveling . i recently made mistake buying cheap replacement off ebay . ebay charger didn't work . fact , i thought ebay-charger working since indicator light worked , but batteries never actually charged . anyway , this canon cb-2lu charger i'm writing this review pricey , yet it seems worth money if you afford it . it small , works , seems charge batteries fast . conclusion , beware cheap imitation ripoffs sold ebay	1
i love this camera . i bought it my trip paris . i found it very easy use . one feature i didn't realize it video sound . i found very useful . i bought 2gb memory card go camera . one it comes doesn't hold many pictures . software easy install use . not really small enough pocket but still great camera budget	1
i really like this camera ! it fairly simple use , takes great pictures packed features . it fits nicely hand compact enough slip coat pocket or purse . we bought this camera our daughter birthday . she using it ease especially loves movie sound option . my opinion , camera winner any adult or kid wanting good all around digital camera . my only negative it battery hog . most digital cameras , you want make sure you get rechargeable batteries large memory card	1
this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . even close-up photos turn out great . you would think this camera more than 3.2 megapixels ! you get much larger memory card though , case most digital cameras	1
i just got this camera christmas . i hate reading directions , so i popped battery memory card i off ! very user friendly , all right options . plus , its size average cell phone . coolest thing powershot it knows which way you're holding camera , so if you hold it vertical get tall shot , viewer turns all itself . i also love you edit video camera set up slide shows . its very easy load pics onto my computer usb connection - or set up slide show tv . it even holds voice memos cute sound effects when i take pictures . this really great camera	1
i've only owned couple pairs binoculars so don't ton experience different models . but i can't imagine it getting much better than these general use . first off , they very clear bright deliver very crisp image , even turned off . but 10x there noticeable shaking image . but then ... turn it just dampens everything beautifully . even more detail revealed it kind takes my breath away every time i use them . while this initial " wow " factor dissipate over time , i can't imagine i'll regret purchasing these ever . they good . i agree others complained lens caps . but caps actually work pretty well now i've installed some 52mm b+w uv filters . caps fit pretty snuggly onto filters . also , filters haven't hindered viewing imho	1
i concur other reviewers . although binoculars heavy , they're 4 ounces lighter than my old 10x50 minolta . canon sharper , brighter , smaller , even more magnification . image stabilization works very well , although it doesn't stop moving objects ( joke ) . besides image stabilization , close focus plus ! although pricey , i believe they're well worth it . now my brother wants pair	1
recent arrival our first child prompted this purchase . i knew i wanted minidv allow me maximum editing flexibility software compatibility . i scoured internet product reviews decided get canon elura 100 this widely considered best " budget " digital camcorder . course , i decided just last stocks ran out - canon no longer make elura line . i then faced starting scratch all majors just released new cameras . i've used canon slrs years so naturally gravitated towards z-series camcorders . they didn't get great reviews though . then i spotted panasonic pv-gs85 immediately grabbed fact it ois - optical image stabilization . it uses actual optical component counteract hand shake opposed electronic jiggery-pokery other cameras this price point use . i tried out both canon panasonic electronics store difference effectiveness ois eis amazing - optical stabilization just leaps bounds better . what sold me panasonic . i went gs85 over gs80 addition snapshot capability - it take still photo memory card whilst you filming . quality isn't fantastic , but it isn't terrible either it perfect capturing stills those magical moments emailing relatives when you happen middle filming . i don't use windows , so can't comment software included , but camera works flawlessly imovie my macbook pro kino linux . video quality very good , color reproduction so far proved excellent . auto white balance takes little while adjust after turning camera ( maybe 20-30s ) so you bit ahead game . startup very quick even without fast start option where camera " goes sleep " when you close lcd rather than switching off all together . all excellent camera	1
it my husband when he diving he loves said it takes great pictures . shark mode works grea t.t he pictures very clear	1
case well made looks good . it belt loop rather than clip so you remove your belt get it or off . magnetic snap convenient , but not super secure	1
soft case made sturdy leather , which offers two distinct advantages : excellent protection , space saving . i don't like fluffy kinds because defeats purpose f30 compactness . wrest band adds convenience , but that just personally perference . magnetic door functions well also ... easy open , strong enough enclose camera . this importance because i don't want joggle around case miss any shot . i take out camera my fingers position , like cowboy bringing out his gun ready kill ... haahh , not good analogy but ya know whata mean ..	1
only negative these binoculars they come really cheesy plastic strap , which i promptly threw away . otherwise they function fine bargain binocular	1
i don't words this item ... it very very ... i'm taking best pictures i never imagin	1
christmas gift my girlfriend . she loves it . small enough always carry around . i'm actually kinda jealous ... maybe i'll buy myself	1
camera case expected . no complaints , i searched best price this item , found it here . i just think shipping charges way too high . i know sellers charge these rates , but i believe they should reconsider . it not unusual shipping charges exceed 50% price item ( such this one ) not so expensive . future , i giving my business sellers no shipping ( or low shipping charges ) . you should too	1
not big or small . lightly padded small compartment hold extra battery	1
i used this battery my olympus since i first got it five years ago , i take lot pictures , kids , vacations , ebay photos . i originally thought i would invest rechargeable batteries , but i such poor luck batteries not charging or charger not working i decided keep using this battery . 5 years , i only used 3 sets batteries . i bought my first set circuit city $20 , so this good price here amazon . i felt obligated write this review because first only review nothing battery whatsoever , yet he still gave it only one star . go figure	1
great little package ! small , compact , fits easily your pocket . took them giants stadium use my end zone seat . able see action very clearly opposite end field . easy focus my bad eyes	1
well , i bought bino my 7 year old nephew introduce him birding . he loves it , infact he pronounced it " pretty cool " . good buy considering its compact what its supposed	1
i got this little gadget few days ago i love it . i think negative reviews come people who expecting too much . device so many different things , it them pretty darn well . granted , it isn't great any one thing , but , face it , you pay lot more any device even one thing " great . " if you looking professional quality videos or photos , you pay " professional " price . if you looking amazing little gadget packs lot functions into one little package , look no further . what it worth , i took great indoor video photos , pictures came out just fine	1

professional photographer , i find myself going through 5-6 these cords each year . my equipment my livelyhood although it used often , i am exceptionally careful all my gear not bang it around or abuse it . i use stroboframe which makes it necessary use this cord raise flash well above focal plane camera . these cords very expensive get just few months out them . eventually , hot shoe connector either become loose connection no longer function or plastic connector break your flash unit fall ground . ( this happened twice me fortunately i able catch flash unit ! )the cord indespensible if you need it , but contact canon usa ask them reengineer this cord or expect replace them every few months	-1

i video work attracted sale price extra height this particular tripod . come find out , this model not fluid head , meaning , if you any panning camcorder , it won't smooth you'd probably like it . also , end pan head tends " unwind , " causing your panned image back up little ways . thus , i think it rather misleading label this " photo / video " tripod . additionally , i don't really care cheap feel some plastic knobs adjusters . finally , mine came few , very minor cosmetic blemishes , almost if it used . instead video , i'll utilizing this one microphone mount . if you want video , please buy tripod fluid head . you'll love it , i guarantee tha t.t hat why i give this one 2 stars	-1
i purchased this camera august 2006 sent it out repair 4 times already same problem it november 2006 . kodak just keeps telling me send it get repaired . right ? it takes great pictures but when you try download them your computer it works first time . you try it second time it freezes gives you cannot read device message . i two kids most important thing send picture emails all relatives across globe their updated lives . i now go my local photo place get cd prints made then download them into my easyshare software . oh , shouldn't it easier after spending much money camera . also , i purchase dock adapter my printer dock . when i put camera dock , it doesn't charge battery or print pictures , screen just goes grey . this camera its main board firmware repaired replaced every time it come back me . cost shipping , cd prints just added headache this camera given me . kodak not helpful all they inform me only form communication through email . what they afraid , they need face problem satisfy their customers . not purchase this camera , it great if you just never want get them out camera	-1
customer before me , you camera d200 might recall . please check nikon website more info . you described exact recall problem . good luck ! btw , you tried or someone tried this battery d70 ? i am thinking consolidate all greys batteries rather than black d70 grays d200 .	-1
" you get what you pay " most time cliche true , but there products out there break this rule . philips dvp642 one them , great quality , versatile product selling bargain price . this not . i hoping same this product all " glowing " reviews here . however , this quality this monopod very disappointing . first all , you ask yourself , why you need monopod over tripod ? myself most , it because we need some stability portability our telephoto zoom lenses . however , telephoto zooms long heavy so monopod should designed strong solid live up task . this monopod doesn't even come close . here it bad points : -the aluminum construction very cheap quality . leg segments wobble laterally when you extend close them . it feels like thin , cheap aluminum monopod feels it could break half like toothpick any time . -the head very cheap not solid . no matter how tight i tightened head , my camera would slope down . workmanship head so cheap any point , you think you're going break plastic tightening screw if you tighten it too much . i think we've all experienced past . -the leg locks not tight . when you push down monopod , leg segments slide back into themselves . end , it risk i took hoping i could get high-quality product cheap price . sometimes , you get away . walmart sells very decent functioning tripod only $30 . this case , i should've bought real monopod . oh well , i wasted $16 i could've used help pay higher quality monopod	-1
i just bought sony cybershot w100 camera little over month ago i only taken 30-40 pictures , i loved it then it just stopped working , so i recharged baterry , no luck still camera wouldn't turn off or . so thankfully i bought 2nd backup battery charged it tried camera again . no it doesn't work it only makes slight ding sound shuts off . basically worthless . it seems like it might short circuited . but i so excitted buy this camera i read all instructions before use , i haven't let anyone else use it it hasn't out my sight , never dropped , never extreme hot or cold , always well protected . so i am going try return it or exchange it . i am hoping get good service or i really upset spending so much money research just take 30-40 pictures . hopefully i let you know if they stand their products . before now i always happy what i bought amazo	-1
image quality pathetic . it generates ludicrous amounts noise even lowest iso ( 80 ) . rest assured , you disappointed . i returned mine within day	-1
camera takes good pictures long you steady hand . some pictures come out dark some shadows pictures . some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer . this camera randomly broke after 1 year i not drop camera ( just like reviewer ) . i bought sony pda same thing happened lcd - randomly broke - crack across lcd . course , sony said it my fault i must something it refused honor warranty pda - after 1 month ? since camera out warranty , i knew there nothing they going . so if you want decent camera lousy customer service support it - go it ! but if you want great camera great company support their products , look elsewhere . i used great financial supporter sony products - monitors , computers , camcorder , memory sticks , etc . i am not buying anymore sony products - i lost love sony their products ! beware ! canon , here i come !	-1
i bought it my 18-55 ef-s , it looks like it not very efficient - but i guess it normal 18mm ( 1.6 ) . i would prefered " tulip " design like those sigma	-1
i this camera since jan ' 05 so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while trips weddings . don't expect much it you happy . entry level dslr it what it supposed ideal conditions . i find it strength taking people photographs bright light , provided they not moving . cons : landscape photography this camera lacking - both due inadequate megapixels it inability capture natural blues greens very well . battery dies fast . battery i got it hardly lasts whole day shooting , especially when shooting raw mode . i yet fill up 1gig card when shooting raw mode(approx 150 shots ) before battery dies . surprisingly when shooting jpegs , i get more shots per charge(over 300 ) but hardly enough last day . i cannot tell you number times battery died me while i out hike . so i always carry backup film camera ( my trusty elan 7 ) . viewfinder very dim . when i look through my elan 7 then through 300d , it painfully obvious how dark image through 300d viewfinder . indoor situations low light this becomes handicap , especially when resort manual focus . autofocus low light 300d terrible . when shooting indoors , autofocus hunts ends up focusing something behind your intended subject . i lots beautiful photos walls sconces background sharp focus while people standing front middle frame out focus blur . this despite 420ex flash my camera uses infrared beam assist focus . 420ex flash supposed " talk " camera adjust power order ensure subjects not over or under exposed . however , 300d , this crap shoot best many my indoor shots over/under exposed . after five months , shutter button started sticking . i would click it then it would remain depressed . shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it little . annoying thing camera settings displayed rear camera not top beside shutter button . since there only one thumbwheel , it not easy change aperature shutter speed . example , if you use thumbwheel change aperature , then change shutter speed you would press button while same time turning thumbwheel . when you take thousands shots over life camera , this real annoyance . so would i recommend this camera : if you casual point shoot person , it affordable entry into dslrs produces decent photos . but if you plan shooting lot indoors or want take landscape photographs actually convey colors accurately , look elsewhere	-1
i picked this up music order my 350d - big mistake . class came chipped , scratched smuged ; tiffen filters very poor quality . yourself favor , like i , find your local camera supply store pick up optical grade filter maybe , oh , 10 dollars more . this tiffen one so bad scratches made their way onto some shots ruined entire day shooting	-1
i known canon very high quality company . however , i deeply shocked disappointed find this camera fails meet expectations i this camera . few years ago i bought fujiffilm 3800 . i loved this camera but after few ski trips i found it rather bulky . i then bought canon s500 becaus its small size after many good reviews s400 . most pictures i take ski trip this camera fine . however , if you taking pictures other than outdoors daytime , this camera worse than disposable camera . first , there no red-eye reduction . it simply not work when i set it take flash red-eye reduction . second , pictures taken dusk or dawn come out blurry . i would speculate shutter speed way too slow you would need tripod . third , night picture ?.... forget it . i tried get beatiful picture chicago skyline but picture underexposed . so , i tried manual mode played exposure settings i could not get setting would produce non-blurry pictures . looks like i'll back market fujifilm . after all reviews i've read , i'm waiting other shoe drop ( e18 , lcd , etc . ) . not mention terrible service i reading	-1
after owning three other canon cameras i am through canon . all my other cameras fine . this cameras lcd broke within first month normal use . never dropped ! all my other digital cameras held up years . ive two powershot s50s 1 lost 1 stolen . never problem those both dropped numbers times . this product defect/design flaw canon not cover it under warranty . $150.00 get it repaired it happen again , or you may start getting e18 errors . this expensive paperweight ! poor design . very dissapointed . i never buy canon product again	-1
this my third digital camera , i bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water . i lot research before i bought this it highly rated consumer reports . after few months ok pictures ( macro setting not very good though ) lens cover started sticking but i learned live it . i would manually open up lens cover each time . then lens cover got stuck open position i learning live . but now camera almost completely dead . it not power up properly sometimes it beeps . i'm not sure but i think i am out warranty period this . i not buy canon camera . this camera made too cheaply . i wish things not made break right away	-1
these my experiences extender mounted my eos 10d . i'm currently debating whether or not buy it my new 30d , but it looks like i don't want risk wasting my money . let me explain : let me start saying only reason i gave this 2 stars instead 1 because it prevent my nose smudging lcd screen . i shoot events nightclubs lot , so i'm always ( ) running around get shots , causing me sweat , which causes sweaty oily nose tip ( ) i always show subjects their photos after i take them , so smudgy screen kind annoying . further clarification , i'm asian , so my nose not defined or long other ethnicities . i run around lot when i shoot . so constant activity eventually led extender naturally fall off . i got lucky once , found it general vicinity where i , but second time , i wasn't so lucky . so what i ? i purchased one . not only i purchase extender , i purchase viewfinder replacement ( piece soft rubber ) because attached lost extender . 2 weeks , again , same problem . i didn't even bother buying any replacements , this time , i upgraded 30d . if you don't plan doing lot running around , then this piece may okay you . however , please take into consideration this piece also fell off me while putting my camera back my canon backpack . some reason , piece didn't fit tightly mount camera . problem , most people mentioned , images very noticeably smaller through this extender , so prepared strained eyes if you plan using your camera all day . i guess i'll check it out my local camera shop see how it fits 30d ; i'll sure write review if results different than 10d	-1

camera case only works if you wear belt -- there no clip . case itself holds only camera , not even space spare battery or memory card .

while this lens attractive price tag , this lens serious trouble sharpness . only high shutter speeds ( 1/250 above approx . ) or good flash middle apertures ( f/8 f/22 approx . ) it deliver sharp images . horribly slow autofocus . i am already saving buy l-series or usm version	-1

this camera worked very well until lens got jammed its extended position . i sent camera warranty service ( i it less than 7 months ) , they refused honor warranty because it bit scuffed little decorative ring end lens attached 2-sided tape come off . they claimed this happened due physical damage , but this occurred during normal use : i just changing modes lens didn't retract . don't bother trying get warranty service unless unit looks brand new . even then , don't surprised if they renege warranty . i a410 very same thing ( lens got jammed ) , but stolen break-in before i sent it out service ( so i suppose it no loss after all ) . obviously there design flaw causes lens extend too far come off track inside . short , this camera not suitable frequent use field . if you buy it , plan use it lot , expect buying camera or paying repair should covered under warranty ( which i'm not doing ) soon .	-1

" you get what you pay " most time cliche true , but there products out there break this rule . philips dvp642 one them , great quality , versatile product selling bargain price . this not . i hoping same this product all " glowing " reviews here . however , this quality this monopod very disappointing . first all , you ask yourself , why you need monopod over tripod ? myself most , it because we need some stability portability our telephoto zoom lenses . however , telephoto zooms long heavy so monopod should designed strong solid live up task . this monopod doesn't even come close . here it bad points : -the aluminum construction very cheap quality . leg segments wobble laterally when you extend close them . it feels like thin , cheap aluminum monopod feels it could break half like toothpick any time . -the head very cheap not solid . no matter how tight i tightened head , my camera would slope down . workmanship head so cheap any point , you think you're going break plastic tightening screw if you tighten it too much . i think we've all experienced past . -the leg locks not tight . when you push down monopod , leg segments slide back into themselves . end , it risk i took hoping i could get high-quality product cheap price . sometimes , you get away . walmart sells very decent functioning tripod only $30 . this case , i should've bought real monopod . oh well , i wasted $16 i could've used help pay higher quality monopod	-1

i just bought sony cybershot w100 camera little over month ago i only taken 30-40 pictures , i loved it then it just stopped working , so i recharged baterry , no luck still camera wouldn't turn off or . so thankfully i bought 2nd backup battery charged it tried camera again . no it doesn't work it only makes slight ding sound shuts off . basically worthless . it seems like it might short circuited . but i so excitted buy this camera i read all instructions before use , i haven't let anyone else use it it hasn't out my sight , never dropped , never extreme hot or cold , always well protected . so i am going try return it or exchange it . i am hoping get good service or i really upset spending so much money research just take 30-40 pictures . hopefully i let you know if they stand their products . before now i always happy what i bought amazo	-1
i am not impressed tiffen filters i got this set . finish rings poor . despite previously poor reputaion , i recently purchased some 67mm quantaray filter local ritz camera store which much better quality compared this set tiffen filters . i never got tiffens before , good experience hoyas . i probably stay those now . now come think it , ritz camera indicated quantaray they made hoya . glass all filters quite bit more reflective compared hoyas quantarays . not good sign . circular polarizer some smudges some lense swirl after 10 sheets lense tissue quite bit cleaning solution failed fully cleared off . quite frustrating . all filters came lint few little smudges them , not sure if store handling or manufacturer handling blame , but none other filters i got before this kind problem right out box . set might cheap , but it sure good reason	-1

camera takes good pictures long you steady hand . some pictures come out dark some shadows pictures . some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer . this camera randomly broke after 1 year i not drop camera ( just like reviewer ) . i bought sony pda same thing happened lcd - randomly broke - crack across lcd . course , sony said it my fault i must something it refused honor warranty pda - after 1 month ? since camera out warranty , i knew there nothing they going . so if you want decent camera lousy customer service support it - go it ! but if you want great camera great company support their products , look elsewhere . i used great financial supporter sony products - monitors , computers , camcorder , memory sticks , etc . i am not buying anymore sony products - i lost love sony their products ! beware ! canon , here i come !	-1
camera worked fine ; however , after six months , it stopped working . i took it pentax authorized repairer pentax refused pay camera because dirt grit zoom mechanism . my use no way abusive . i previous canon powershot s200 lasted forever same usage , until i gave it away . i guess i should stayed canon . i bought pentax its size lightweight , but what good if it doesn't last ! don't get pentax expect long term use out it	-1

please aware this camera shock sensitivityi pretty happy this all-in-one compact camera until it repaired second time . it sensitivity vibration or slight bump while lens out way too sensitive real world . result it loses it ability focus zoom . it didn't help it commonly powered while pocket , lens protruding , thereby causing unintentional harm lens assembly . first time it happened casio repaired it under warranty . second time it outside warranty repair center wanted $137 repair it - that more than 1/3 original purchase price . i won't reinvest weak product . i'd rather put money into new camera altogether	-1
i this camera since jan ' 05 so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while trips weddings . don't expect much it you happy . entry level dslr it what it supposed ideal conditions . i find it strength taking people photographs bright light , provided they not moving . cons : landscape photography this camera lacking - both due inadequate megapixels it inability capture natural blues greens very well . battery dies fast . battery i got it hardly lasts whole day shooting , especially when shooting raw mode . i yet fill up 1gig card when shooting raw mode(approx 150 shots ) before battery dies . surprisingly when shooting jpegs , i get more shots per charge(over 300 ) but hardly enough last day . i cannot tell you number times battery died me while i out hike . so i always carry backup film camera ( my trusty elan 7 ) . viewfinder very dim . when i look through my elan 7 then through 300d , it painfully obvious how dark image through 300d viewfinder . indoor situations low light this becomes handicap , especially when resort manual focus . autofocus low light 300d terrible . when shooting indoors , autofocus hunts ends up focusing something behind your intended subject . i lots beautiful photos walls sconces background sharp focus while people standing front middle frame out focus blur . this despite 420ex flash my camera uses infrared beam assist focus . 420ex flash supposed " talk " camera adjust power order ensure subjects not over or under exposed . however , 300d , this crap shoot best many my indoor shots over/under exposed . after five months , shutter button started sticking . i would click it then it would remain depressed . shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it little . annoying thing camera settings displayed rear camera not top beside shutter button . since there only one thumbwheel , it not easy change aperature shutter speed . example , if you use thumbwheel change aperature , then change shutter speed you would press button while same time turning thumbwheel . when you take thousands shots over life camera , this real annoyance . so would i recommend this camera : if you casual point shoot person , it affordable entry into dslrs produces decent photos . but if you plan shooting lot indoors or want take landscape photographs actually convey colors accurately , look elsewhere	-1

i am my third off-camera cord ( one per year ) . two broken . other reviewers noted , four screws under metal retaining clip " female " end cord loosen eventually fail . i found thin narrow knife used remove black " spring " cover over screws shoe . you then tighten screws screwdriver . if you use locktite screws then they not loosen . canon should this factory . i use this cord stroboframe " portrait/landscape " grip which raises flash over camera six inches thus eliminating red eye providing much more pleasing light . stroboframe grip comes right size threaded screw this cord . when my cords failed i lost extended-through lens metering just like reviewer noted . i am not professional photographer only use camera occasionally yet cord still fails . canon should re-engineer this cord make it more durable . unfortunately , i not believe there alternative cords . it looks like i need keep buying canon cords	-1
i known canon very high quality company . however , i deeply shocked disappointed find this camera fails meet expectations i this camera . few years ago i bought fujiffilm 3800 . i loved this camera but after few ski trips i found it rather bulky . i then bought canon s500 becaus its small size after many good reviews s400 . most pictures i take ski trip this camera fine . however , if you taking pictures other than outdoors daytime , this camera worse than disposable camera . first , there no red-eye reduction . it simply not work when i set it take flash red-eye reduction . second , pictures taken dusk or dawn come out blurry . i would speculate shutter speed way too slow you would need tripod . third , night picture ?.... forget it . i tried get beatiful picture chicago skyline but picture underexposed . so , i tried manual mode played exposure settings i could not get setting would produce non-blurry pictures . looks like i'll back market fujifilm . after all reviews i've read , i'm waiting other shoe drop ( e18 , lcd , etc . ) . not mention terrible service i reading	-1
i purchased canon powershot s500 digital elph last march . i kept getting blurry pictures so i called canon technical support . they went through whole procedure make sure my camera all set up . well i followed their directions but everything way it should . so they said i should send it because there obviously problem it . then i sent it pay shipping there . they sent it back said they switched out some optical thing . well i just finally went get my pictures developed they all same problem . they never fixed problem . mind you this approximately 9 months my son life before age 2 . i called tech support ended up wait more than 24 hours call back supervisor . she said they would send me pre paid envelope check out camera . well i greatful tell her during babysitting late august little boy dropped my camera so there damage outside part camera , but it not effect quality pictures because they same prior day it dropped . she said they would probably not cover it due fact it might caused dropped camera . i told i proof when it happened pictures prior date coming blurry just like it before i sent it first time . i started cry my son 9 months all ruined she practically laughing when i got off phone . camera worse than disposable camera . don't waste your time or money this piece junk . i recommend olympus . my olympus prior this only 3 megapixels better quality than this piece junk . i am planning contacting better business bureau regarding this matter . please don't waste your time this , like i ! i hope this helps people make better choices ! good luck ! i wish someone could forecasted this me	-1

i admit i'm far expert digital cameras . i take over 32,000 photographs 35mm cameras over 20 years . i purchased 510 powershot july 2005 . it wasn't too long before zoom cameras lens wouldn't work . i contacted canon over this you believe this company audacity charge me shipping their faulty camera back them . i understand them saying , ' we'll charge you first , but once we establish fault due us , we'll then reimburse you back . ' i enclosed type written letter camera asking canon contact me when they received my camera ( mail ) i also asked they contact me when it shipped back . ( i also emailed them same request ) . neither my wishes ever fulfilled canon behalf . itself enough me i've bitter ever since . i've also told every person i've met who wanted buy digital camera this incident . i'm pleased say , i've steered most away this company . what else i say this camera : this camera slow times after its taken picture . i've missed out some good shots due this . it eats batteries like there no tomorrow so one must rechargeable aa even make this camera worth its while . i've not used other digital cameras so maybe they all this way but if i take 3 minute movie ( this camera ) my home during day go outside , most things outside very white . almost like looking infra red photograph . when filming outside , when one goes inside during day , everything dark . like i said , maybe all digital cameras this way ? i wouldn't recommend this camera or anything canon makes if you want my personal opinion . think . you pay shipping camera that barely few months old still under warranty . that disgusting , that all i say . there should zero this , not 1 star	-1

i only wish i read previous review before i bought this item . i too trying convert my hi8 tapes digital format using pass-through my sony minidv handycam . i bought this way-too-expensive cable , mostly because it only option available . it seems ridiculous me cable should cost much low-end disk drive or graphics card , considering technology involved those devices . but my real problem failure sony reveal s-video connection useless input . this information nowhere package , nor it their website . there notice saying " please make sure this cable compatible your camcorder before you purchase " . you can't read warning when buying online , if buying store , there no way know what compatible because they don't include list compatible camcorders package . i guess they assume everyone run home check their website , then come back store buy it , instead just buying it seeing if it works . there section handycam manual describing how one might record video device using cable such this one , however they fail mention sony cable won't work , despite premium price they charge . if problem they couldn't make it work both composite s-video cable , then they should just made it work s-video , since composite cable comes camera . shame you , sony , adding little aggravation my day , shame you creating yet proprietary communications standard allows you rake us over coals when we need buy accessories supporting standard . it enough make me want buy canon camcorder ( i buy canon digital cameras precisely because i don't want submit proprietary sony standards like memorystick ) . rant over .	-1

i working this camera year now , product shots online , while sometimes it takes great pics , many times flash pops whites out , or it goes off you get black picture . i take pictures jewelry , if i try shoot piece green blue coloration , color not accurate . purple color this camera not accurately pic up . while you fiddle 4 different picture taking settings , all different modes , you'll never get same picture twice , even saving setting . light just so , get good shot . when it shoots clearly , it take fabulous pictures , but often , pics blurred many others said , when they actually come out . my old camera , dsc p71 3.2 megapixel much better , colors accurate always , shooting flawless foolproof every time , greatest feature re-sizing your picture trimming right camera before uploading . this feature completely missing dsc p200 , which biggest disappointment , i figured it would given i didn't ask when purchasing . why would sony eliminate this great function ? i know when salesman large new york city photo store told me this camera i dreamed , i would not bought it . i prefer also use rechargable aa batteries instead lithium battery , which super hard load , charging this camera nightmare charger it comes . it like puzzle trying get charger inserted just right angle . every time it takes me several minutes , finding good little wall charger it also problem . i recently took this camera vacation take pics get footage burning dvd . sound quality good , but video quality choppy , monitor not let me even see my setting overexposed , so all my footage somewhat overexposed entire trips shootings i made . monitor , while big , not show you always what you shooting , whether still , or movie picture . overall , i would not recommend this camera i actually bought used second my old camera , got my original repaired , because this one doesn't compare . this camera bit too complicated not very user friendly . even after using all this time , i still am not sure what i am going get when i use this camera . i'd say worst features aware someone who needs accurate color , this camera clearly trouble showing blue/green shades , purples accurately , you never show these colors they life this camera , lack " trimming " resizing feature , what sony thinking ? next time , i am trying something other than sony cybershot unless i hear they gone back making great straightforward , uncomplicated easy point shoot camera . this one definitely not	-1

i say i am very disappointed this camera . i really high hopes this one . i waited hd2 come out when i saw lot positive reviews i bought one , i should waited . sanyo call this hd camera doesn't make sense . picture more grain noise then my old high 8 camera . outdoors bright light camera ok . low-light horrible pros : - nice form factor , love look feel it so tiny it fits your pocket . very portable something you take anywhere . - secure digital cards great , transfer edit computer quickly- still pictures pretty good . although still digital cameras better . - hdmi output plug directly into your hdtv ( although if you used watching things hd you disappointed)cons : - indoor low light situations very grainy , even high sensitivity button . - don't attempt take still shots while you filming , it works but when you watch film you hear loud noises shot pauses 2 or 3 seconds then continues . very cheesy . - you hear data written secured digital card video which annoying . i thought sd supposed minimize noise . - watching playback movement this makes me dizzy , not even fast movement either . - image stabilization not great either compared other cameras i used . - audio sounds bit tinny my opinion this camera geared portability able capture moments quickly this something you always carry you . if you aren't too concerned quality picture it probably fine . i really think sanyo great concept one day this could end all all device . now it should come warning it limitations . i am not saying it total garbage , but if you high hopes like i , you disappointed .	-1

panasonic very compact , very stylish sexy my wife called it , but photos very disappointing : they way noisy ! even if set lowest asa setting 80asa it just barely acceptable they get progressively worse anything above 100asa . colours good , it take very good videos , but still photos just plain bad when compared other cameras photoshop cs2 . course it easy understand why : native resolution images . if one investigates such things , notice panasonic only 72 dpi , same sony , canon improves this 180 , nikon 300 dpi . it not just megapixels folks , but how those megapixels recorded what resolution . obviously camera 72 dpi more noise than one 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking upgrading newer model , yourself favour . try 4 or 5 cameras same megapixel range good camera store taking photos same subject same light condition . set camera lowest asa highest picture quality jpg format , take photos , pop sd card into computer , compare images photoshop . enlarge full pixel size ( 100%) , look meta data same time you see yourself . what i , since i not very happy images my panasonic produced ! i this camera 11 months 20 days exactly , today i traded it nikon p5000 after evaluating over dozen models including leica d-lux3 10mp camera , driving sales persons crazy all testing spending 4 hours store , but it very educational them too	-1

i start off saying , i loved my sony cybershot . when alpha came out i couldn't wait get one . it died after 200 pictures day three three week once life time trip through south america . amazon said it out their hands because it must returned within 30 days . i've spent 3 hours so far dealing sony . most people i spoke or on-line live chat support unfamiliar product transferred me around business support , computers , video . they also contradicted one . when i get someone who knew product i told firmly despite camera lemon malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they would only ' repair it ' not replace it . now i am stuck lemon , i fear i history further disappointment frustration this camera . i highly recommend you read all customer reviews . other people problems camera , i ignored them because i faith sony thought other alpha owners ' dud cameras unusual . if you decide purchase anyway , i highly recommend you not buy through amazon , but through real store good fair return policy , stands behine their products . places like microcenter exhange , no questions ask . i am kicking myself because amazon $100 cheaper then microcenter . penny wise pound foolish . i love amazon , but , i never buy anything other than books dvds them . lesson learned electronics .	-1

i no longer own my previous much finer camcorder , so i finally found myself market purchasing some kind camcorder until i could get back my feet get good one . i thought this one may , good price , looks sharp , purchased impulse . . . big no-no . i say camera takes decent pictures ( previous reviews state , almost exclusively outside broad daylight or indoors withvery good lighting ) . other than , don't bother . mp3 cutefunction ( quite possibly most practical ) . video , uhh , let'snot even go there . voice recorder , also not bad - records wav format transferred pc . jack all trades , master none . . . i guess would bestway finally describe this item . i say i'll saving up nowfor much better camcorder no more " i just gotta this right now " save your $ , find quality product - even if you pay little more it . trust me , it overall better long run . .	-1
i extremely disappointed this product ; i felt very let down sony , because years i bought sony items confidence , knowing anything produced them would good reliable . this item only goes prove sony standards dropped , such i use considerable caution when buying anthing else theirs . what lets this product down lack distance one before sound breaks up ; 2 metres ( not 45 metres stated wrapping ) best i could , straight line . no , all this item fit rubbish bin	-1

i very disappointed images produced this camera . i hoped ultra-wide photos ( which my main reason going this camera ) also would ultra sharp , but instead they tended soft . camera lag time 1/10th second , so it more point , shoot wait camera . v705 may okay posting internet images or enlarging small prints , but don't expect sharpness typical better quality cameras . my opinion , camera squeezes too much out jpeg photo way compression shooting tif files just isn't practical . i demand better image quality my cameras , when zooming , i like see detail . i certainly don't like everything going soft .	-1
this terrible purchase my part . it doesn't even deserve 1 star . i just wanted small bag wear over shoulder quick access my z7590 without holding other equipment or too bulky . bag too small my z7590 , i paid $8 shipping plus return shipping . i only hope they don't charge me re-stocking fee . i went walmart , found cute little bag electronics dept . camera fits great , room strap extra memory cards or battery if necessary . they cute ones ladies too , pink polka dots or stripes inside ! only $12 . next time , i'll smarter !	-1

nice looking . good quality . but case two large flaps sides which make it difficult put camera out .	-1
cheaply made ill-fitting , this " deluxe " case isn't worth half price . there no handle or wrist strap provided ; your camera strap becomes carry handle . small , snap-strap provided , but i can't figure out what it ... snap easily unfastened light pressure , i wouldn't trust it hold weight empty case , much less heft camera inside . don't buy this item : amazon not reimburse you return postage , because it not their fault you don't like it ... you returning it . save yourself trouble .	-1
i purchased this spent 3 days phone hewlett packard trying get correct adapter so it would fit my r818 camera ( dock thin port , roughly 10 connectors ) while r818 mini usb plug ) . hp less than helpful when it came trying get correct adapter , getting different answer each time i spoke different rep ( even told one point no supervisors working ) . i finally able get someone willing send me one , but said it going 10+ business days get it , which then i'll vacation ( i purchased it well advance giving myself time get adapter , thinking it not hard get ) . i looking forwared using dock my vacation . i would definately * not * recommend this if you photosmart r818 digital camera , unless you like stress spending hours phone hewlett packard trying get correct part , waiting 10+ business days get it	-1
this first canon product disappointed me its quality . they must acquire them their chinese supplier 98 cents . this plastic device wobbles even when fully rotated detente position . i bought it use canon 250d close-up lens it barely adequate function . canon should refund anyone who mistakenly bought one these hockey pucks .	-1

it unfortunate name like canon , you expect quality camera . that why you shell out money item you think canon stand behind . unfortunately , this not case . i bought this camera use graduate school ( industrial design ) . i needed it research my thesis . i figured , all product photographs , need good portfolio pieces , spending 500.00 8mp camera would well worth investment . i wrong . month after i bought camera , it started malfunction . lens got stuck would not come out . neither would it go all way back , so lens cover would not close ( not only putting lens danger , but draining battery well . ) it still under warranty , so i sent it canon service center elk grove village , illinois . it received , i informed my camera would returned 7-10 business days . almost month half ago . i put my thesis research hold because i not proper camera it . every time i call service center , i am told " parts back order " . evidently they don't know when these shipments due their center , so they don't know when i my camera back . best part , when i called two weeks ago , they offered me " brand new " s215 . told me it great deal i should accept offer because " they never " ( meaning they never offer new camera one repair . ) i pointed out s215 only 5mp , smaller screen , cost nearly 300.00 less than my camera . i also reminded her my camera brand new when it broke i send it . today i told there no information my camera , backordered parts , or when they could send my camera back . woman phone asked me why i didn't accept s215 offered , when i explained asked camera same model mine , she said they not authorized . i told her i going spend time originally set aside my thesis research write letters both service center canon corporate headquarters , she suddenly technician she could consult , my camera would back me end week . i won't hold my breath , but copy this review sent canon .	-1

i've purchased seven items amazon 2005 , so i'm not complete rookie . this item ad title includes word " battery " big , bold letters . i purchased this kit advertised " used price " , but " condition : new " . ad picture clearly shows battery . i looked several ads not read individual seller comment " battery missing " uppercase , though regular font . me , missing part warrants more warning than " comment " . that my " lesson learned " , but i still find it confusing advertise both complete incomplete kits together under identical ad titles without prominently displayed warning big , bold text indicating most valuable part missing . lesson learned : read whole ad specific seller , especially " seller comments "	-1
this camera looks cool . but it so , so not cool . people responsible this device should ashamed themselves . this far one worst products i ever purchased . ever . second day lens cap no longer stayed place . it " clips " ... but not long . camera internal memory rubbish camera totally destroyed my memory card somehow . it complelety unreadable . even 150mb card i could only take few short quality videos . you shoot more video if you use low quality settings . i'm talkin ' low quality . worse than any video you've seen online . more problems include battery cover falling off without hardly even touching it . controls interface not intuitive . you'll probably end up accidentally deleting files you meant keep . oh , earbuds come camera/mp3 player/hunk-o-junk huuuuge . they aren't comfortable least cord too short . i camera my pocket when i stood erect , earphones violently yanked my ears . they're obviously intended oompa-loompas . i'm sure i could found more problems this thing , but it eventually died me no reason . don't waste your time this . you sorely disappointed . fact , if i could give this product rating of-10 stars i would so . i'm so extremely disappointed this camera	-1
they made several changes - some good , most bad - since i bought my last sony handicam 8/2003 . first all , there no carrying strap . this very inconvenient if you plan use your hand anything else except holding your camera . i managed jury rig one but it royal pain . docking station just one more thing carry when you want upload your mini cassettes your computer , you take camera off docking station change cassettes . this messes up my editing program . fortunately i still my old camera . ability take still shots better - more megapixels - but not good enough zoom or enlarge . while i told most people prefer use led screen ( i don't knoiw why it eats up more power you can't see clearly bright sun ) i like use viewfinder . it no longer tilt up feature so i end up mashing battery into my cheek . this last complaint batteries . sony lied amount time battery hold . 5 hour battery only charges 194 minutes my camera . that slightly more than 3 hours ; it nowhere near 5 hours . 7 hour battery not get anywhere near 7 hours either . their packages should accurate . all all , it not good older product . there also should setting stop it running if rec . button not pushed . this my last sony unless they make major improvements	-1

i'm not good photographer but use my cameras vacation/backpacking pictures . p3 fourth point shoot nikon camera my family owned . one previous cameras lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt it . p3 lens extends out pretty far when camera turned . i accidently dropped it 30 " off ground when it only few days old . it landed back but flipped over lens . outer ring lens ended up crooked would not retract or focus . i sent it back nikon i expected they said repair would not covered warranty . they charged $162.50 fix it . mastercard program called " purchase assurance " hopefully cover repair cost ! other night i saw commercial tv olympus camera could dropped 5 feet , get wet , or even frozen down 14 degrees still take pictures . i wish i seen ad first . nikon takes great pictures but way too fragile small point shoot camera . not buying nikon anymore .	-1
here short version . oct05 i bought fujifilm finepix f460 digital camera $299.99 . nov06 camera stopped working correctly - snapshots alternating bright/dark horizonal strips across them . jan07 i sent camera fujifilm service center repair stating camera always handled care ~ $300 camera should work more than just 1 month after its warranty expires . jan07 service center sent me repair estimate $70.00 + tax shipping totaling $85.95 ( i spent $16.52 send it them so my total expense would $102.47 repair if i accepted ) . feb07 i contacted service center stated i think they should stand behind their product fix camera once they verify malfunction not caused user abuse . i don't think it makes sense me pay $100 repair $300 camera stopped working only 1 month after warranty expired . service rep , named christina , asked me fax her copy original reciept she would see what she could . i complied . mar07 fujifilm returned camera me unrepaired note saying i not reply estimate . now i now send them camera its memory card printout this review asking them refund cost camera , its memory card , shipping i paid .	-1

-- update 4/23/2007 - vendor indicates new firmware release due 5/2007 - 6/2007 time frame , it may fix issue limited number pictures mentioned below . -- picture quality fair adjusting brightness contrast setup yields good results . appearance unit good black cherry frames nicely finished , but red rectangular sensor remote below lcd display mars effect somewhat . 5.6 inches , this size frame only useful where it viewed up close . images smaller than 4x6 print you would typically view book or hold your hand . i found putting it book shelf too far away . end table next chair you would view it better . size lcd also should tell you resolution not spectacular , true any frame this category . my biggest problem this particular unit even after updating latest firmware ( ~ 3/2007 ) , it only display up 250 pictures . i expected what ever memory card i inserted would displayed . overall this still good buy if you not want display large number photos . i am very disappointed number displayable pictures not listed manufacturer product description so you know limit before you purchase it	-1

i bought this camera myself during christmas 2004 . it suppose utility camera , ebay items class projects kids only -- i don't trust digital cameras family photos . kodak cx7300 seemed fit bill ; inexpensive , easy use more than enough resolution 3.2 mp . flaw this camera didn't appear until i pulled it out drawer some months later . camera wouldn't turn . i checked batteries they excellent shape . i eventually tried replacing batteries , sure enough , worked . next time i took out camera , exact same thing happened . time after . first , i thought cx7300 eating batteries . but eventually i came conclusion camera doesn't eat batteries , it nibbles them . it won't run anything but brand-spanking-new batteries . kodak batteries came cx7300 still my mini-mag flashlight , going strong . i contacted kodak this flaw . they wanted talk what kind batteries i'm using -- kodak -- or option my purchasing camera dock some rechargeable batteries . solution would increase my investment seventy-five percent . i thought buying optional ac adapter would simple , cheap , solution . surprise , surprise , cx7300 one few digital cameras kodak makes doesn't take one . so , now i'm way past warranty , what i it ? i'm shopping camera	-1

i agree other reviews this scope . i purchased this scope christmas gift . when i opened it , equatorial mount ( basis entire scope ) broken . i contacted celestron promised part it , which never arrived . i contacted company again finally replacement part shipped me . it didn't fit . finally , i sent telescope replace original telescope . equatorial mount 1 piece .. yeah ! too bad optical tube screw bent i could not assemble this one . i even chance speak manager technical support ( who original person who offered send me part never arrived ) all i got bunch excuses . i finally took peices both boxes made myself one entire telescope . it february i just now product works . ( i haven't time try it though ! ) celestron offered no refunds this telescope , so buyer beware . if they not willing satisfy customers , your business better served company who stand behind product it sells . good luck	-1

i own olympus fe-100 digital camera , it came unchargeable batteries ( oxyride ) . i switched energizer batteries bought energizer 4-battery charger less than price half tank gas . it not quick charger like this one , but i say less than half investment , i've got charger job . i would not spend this kind money charger . so i say , if you're part " gotta it now " generation , you definitely pay convenience . otherwise , charge your batteries more slowly ( 2-3 hours ) save lot money	-1

recently built digital picture frame scratch , i excited when someone gave us this frame xmas , see what commercial frame would like . after using it few weeks , i say if it wasn't present i would return it get one built people who some sense innovation . good : * screen bright , images look great * resolution only 640x480 but it play images up 10 megapixel they look pretty good me . doesn't seem like you need much higher resolution than such small screen . * computer connection worked great - i plugged it into my xp box , all drivers installed automatically without need cd then 4 new removable drives showed up . it would nice if only drives card them showed up but this minor issue . bad : my main complaint this picture frame people who made it obviously no interest making sort product you enjoy using because it clear inventor appreciated why such product would fun or what makes it improvement over what there before . if i bought this frame 1999 or if it cost $50 , i could forgiven it poor design , but 2007 , $180 , it completely unacceptable . we live future here people , get program ! i not used other frames market , but given you buy old tablet pc 12 " screen ebay $70 , strap it into cheap frame make your own , pc-based screen works 100 times better than this frame , just running screen saver under $150 , i'd say this frame not worth money all . this screen just doesn't deliver goods price . some details : * menu system insanely poorly designed - instance , you specific menu adjust system settings - pushing " setup " button any other time nothing despite fact setting global * remote control only works when you standing foot computer pointing it directly tiny ir hole front screen . * screen only works horizontal frame - there no way set it up vertical frame ( i.e. 480x640 frame ) because frame automatically rotates vertical images there no way turn this " feature " off . * slowest slideshow speed setting 1 minute images . your only other option it just 1 image doesn't change . * no way connect remotely computer or easily get images onto frame without take frame where your computer or go through tedious process memory card crappy menu system . * good viewings angles limited but this general problem lcd screens	-1

me-1 provides modest 1.2 magnification viewfinders olympus e-300 e-500 cameras . ideally , this would allow sharper manual focusing more precise framing . unfortunately , this not happen when i used me-1 make number trial images my e-500 , so i returning me-1 refund . ( record , i wear prescription eyeglasses while shooting , my " shooting eye " corrected 20/20 vision . ) like other folks , i find e-500 viewfinder trifle small so it not always easy frame shot see exposure data same time . camera must also pressed against your face when framing , which not always comfortable . some ways , me-1 created more problems than it solved . me-1 kept camera further my face ( though it seemed bump harder against my glasses ) , but cost * narrowing * my angle vision viewfinder . divide viewfinder into four equal columns rows so you eight squares . four squares middle viewfinder easily visible , but those sides , top , bottom * less * visible than before , corners considerably less . frame shot , i move my eye around viewfinder much more me-1 than without it . see exposure data , i shift my eye almost completely away image . more hassle than i need when shooting field . fortunately , there option works me . e-300 e-500 come ep-5 eyecup , which definitely too small my taste . but larger eyecup also available , ep-6 . ep-6 keeps camera little further my face . viewfinder diopter properly adjusted ( critical step no one seems mention ) , ep-6 allows me see both entire image exposure data without shifting my eye very much all . all this vary person person , course , there may circumstances when me-1 exactly what needed -- so two rather than one star . but not standard shooting conditions , especially if you need compose , set exposure , shoot quickly	-1

this first digital camera i owned . overall i am generally satisfied quality pictures it produces . however , there few things , if i known beforehand , would prevented me purchasing this camera . 1 ) camera not plug-and-play ( even if they say it ) . you install kodak easyshare software download pictures . this huge negative . future , i only buy cameras show up removable storage drives when plugged into computer . 2 ) video stored apple quicktime format (* . mov ) . also huge negative . codecs this format not widely available application integration . you download use apple quicktime view them . you not view videos windows media player . it also not compatible some photo-album software . i would only buy cameras future option store video non-proprietary format . update : after review , i found winxp vista plug-n-play camera when it plugged into usb port . it not work win2k . thanks comment made me double-check	-1

i am [ ... ] unit because it not run slideshow media card . 16 mb internal memory slideshow just not enough ! read ! if you call they tell you slideshow cards not possible because page 13 refers excluding pictures slideshow only internal memory . this not definitive statement slideshow not possible card only excluding individual pictures card not possible .

this 7th olympus camera i've owned over years , film digital . i always very pleased olympus cameras their usual superior optics . this camera , though , major disappointment , mainly because even though it shoot raw , there no compatible conversion available yet , leaving you unable process raw images . this renders camera worthless this time serious pictures you no choice but shoot jpeg . olympus should ensured vendors such adobe necessary information make compatible raw conversion plug-ins available before this camera hit market . there no excuse olympus not made sure this case , indeed it downright irresponsible . said above , camera lens quite nice , camera itself operates well . you take quite good pictures . however , camera not suitable flash pictures medium low-light situations there significant lag time time you press shutter picture actually taken ---- if you're taking pictures people , they moved time picture taken . battery life very good . camera fits nicely your palm . , 28 - 500 mm lens great . if you don't shoot raw you don't depend flash photography , camera worth look . otherwise , look other products this time	-1

i've just returned this unit . it doesn't play videos advertised . i able get it properly play . avi files 320 240 resolution ... see other review below . but 320x240 gives postage stamp size picture . 640 480 playback full size but jerky broken .... more later . i now 3 different brands 8 " photo frames my possession : phillips , pandigital , this coby . i developed following list features my " ideal " photo frame . first , video playback : i've taking lot video clips my digital still camera ... they come out well convenience not lug my camcorder , ability quickly transfer clip files within/between chips my computer attractive . i would like frame which play format my camera taking ( . mov , more later ) i'd also like frame play multi-media show ... , play movie clips show presentations , intermixed . jpg photo files . second feature play . wma music files , addition mp3 . this because i non-ipod personal music player . all my music . wma format because it roughly half file size mp3 . third , i would like timer my frame ... set it come morning , off night , example . fourth , i'd like audio or speaker out feature . none these frames home theater-like sound , i extra pair computer speakers i'd probably hook up . video out could come handy too . fifth , i'd like able rotate stills within frame software , manually or automatically . yes , you rotate them computer , but frame may or may not preserve rotation . ( this may depend which photo edit program you using . ) sixth , i'd like folder hierarchy file management system frame software . especially huge chips now available , i see advantage push couple buttons change picture set ( folder ) , rather than switching out chips . here where 3 units i've stack up , followed my next ( fourth ) unit . i am keeping pandigital .... which costco $140 . it plays . mov video files , but not within slideshow . it no speaker out jack sound tinny . it requires mp3 music files . it permits picture rotation . no folder management system . no clock/timer . no ability play stills/video intermixed . i think coby phillips picture quality brighter but pandigital ok . phillips didn't play video , since it also software glitch when i returned it i decided look elsewhere . ( no remote no music philips either . ) coby won't play my videos , even after i used my converter program try 10 different mp4 avi variations . coby plays . wma music files , won't rotate stills , no folder system , no clock/timer . it speaker out jack . it not permit intermixing video stills one multimedia show . picture quality fully equal philips , generally recognized standard . if all you want photos , never turn your camera sideways , this unit good value . unit i'd like get play would image moments model digitalfoci . i've exchanged emails someone there who clearly knows what they talking i believe this unit intermix my photos videos .	-1

i bought this 10 months ago additional camera . night vision only works one cameras interference horrible . it snaps pops all night long i move it all around find " just right spot " . i actually sleep earplugs drown out noise . i live single story 2100 sq . foot house . i should returned it right away , but i kept it because i no other monitor time . now , 10 months later , volume control not work anymore ! i am now trying find new monitor . i love video monitor though , so i look different brand	-1
this monitor worked pretty well 4 months . we purchased this monitor it worked well provided we next room or same floor receiver . however , when we downstairs ( baby room upstairs next our ) monitor fuzzy , static lines running thru . we still able audio recpetion . after 4 months , picture disappeared , audio still operational . not good camera long term	-1
i bought sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder week ago . i surprised sony not provide downloads associated software named " digital voice editor " . sony customer service staff told me if you lost cd came box , you buy new one . only patches software available download . customer service personnel told me it corporate policy despite fact software bound digital device . this immoral policy violating norm digital appliance industries should not encouraged . sony demoting its brand name offering poor post-sales services . think twice before making your buying decision .	-1
my coolpix 8800 lapsed into " system error 2 " mode within weeks getting it . after taking 3 or 4 shots error message comes up i shut it down start it back up take few more shots before error 2 message recurrs . nikon says try fresh battery different storage card ... no help . now nikon says says send it we'll fix it- but don't say what it cost ... shots i get aren't good hp camera we half price . controls ridiculously complex . flash pops up fires when shooting bright light ... whole thing piece junk . only good shots i've gotten it inside shooting documents 2 feet away ... but any outdoor complicated lighting it unreliable ... i wouldn't recommend this camera or any nikon product my worst enemy .... oh yeah , they made lens oddball size so you buy overpriced nikon filters it ....	-1
i down antarctica when i turned camera it said " lens error " . after day missing some best pictures emperor penguins my 8800 , i twisted lens got it work . same thing happened me bolivia , just after warranty expired . i called nikon they insist there no problem camera . google search " lens error " nikon 8800 you find lots unhappy people same experience . this my third last nikon	-1
when it new out box it worked baseball 50% time if i within few feet pitcher or catcher . it seemed become less effective each time i used it point now i'm lucky get reading 10% time . it still works clocking cars but baseball it almost useless .	-1
i very happy previous model dsc-n1 , which took very nice pictures just pointing shooting . but this one , while i only chance use it indoors outdoor raining weather , it really disappointed me . pictures always blured due too much exposure , i used auto flash , which camera should takes nice pictures it point shoot camera it 10.1 mp ! i'm going try more when weather gets better but most possible i return it , i just can't accept quality indoor pictures it takes . i doubt i unlucky got bad one , i can't believe 10.1 mp sony camera takes so poor pictures . after reading previous review terrible sony custmer servce , i decide i avoid sony customer service , camera just returned . note : found review cecelia choy " cece " march 13 , 2007 mentioned same problem i . i didn't this problem my previous model dsc-n1 . april 17 , 2006 : i bought new one it takes nice pictures now ! suggestion those same problem i before -- exchange one !!	-1
i high hopes this battery my nikon camera . it promised more mah than oem battery came camera . unfortunately , it must leaking electrons all over place , since charge this model not compare original . i would guess charge lasts half life original nikon battery . price cheap you get what you pay . if you going purchase this one , get two since you'll need keep one charging while using other . cheers	-1
my primary camera sony hdr-fx1 . i bought gl-2 second unit multiple camera angles sporting events . gl-2 respectable camera but my opinion video image doesn't even come close sony . price rebate offer greatest incentive my purchase this camera . however , beware rebate offer . i sent all documents strict compliance terms rebate only it rejected . rebate facilitator claimed i not include upc code . if i it over , i would dig deeper into my wallet buy second sony	-1
i loved camera , absolutely loved it . i using it one night it died . i went home put charger nothing happened . light charger didn't flash or camera didn't even go after dying . second time i used it , i just got back vacation put it charger . i able turn it look pictures . i looking pictures , it just shut off . i unable find way turn it back or even shut nose . i would not recommend it this reason unless charger you get different than mine .	-1
i searching line elsewhere good camcorder 1 ) replacement my jvc gr-d70u , which died , 2 ) go online video blog . after much study evaluation , i chose canon zr800 based salesman recommendation , frustration number choices which available , presence external microphone jack ( which one my " must-have " options ) . after returning home , i read review miamian " new reviewer " , felt trepidation . after charging battery , i tried camera . lo behold , miamian right . there obvious noise when recording , which not present my jvc . hoping against hope , i played tape back , , just i feared , tape pronounced hiss . this not just tape hiss , but much more pronounced noise , which transfers tv when watching . it rendered camcorder totally unacceptable . i took camcorder back , , like miamian , ordered sony dch-hc38 . ( i know , it doesn't external microphone jack , but after all this confusion , i give up !! why don't they make more cameras them ?? )the plus signs this camera its menu much more intuitively laid out , selection desired item not even require looking instruction book . joystick selector so easy use , select play , rewind , fast forward , stop , pause playback mode , also used select various menu items other modes . wide screen viewfinder ( lcd ) so nice use , easy see , all others ( 4:3 ) become passe ' . i didn't any chance evaluate other aspects camera , due unacceptable noise which demanded rejection unit . picture looked ok ; it not greatly impress me , however , automatic focus appeared slow very noticeable playback . essence , caveat emptor ; especially if you're hard hearing . others watching listening tape not	-1

i loved this camera when i got it . but after three months lens would not close . it makes grinding noises , canon logo pops up screen then shuts off again . i am very disappointed this camera	-1
well . i convinced fx07 bad product after using it 6 months . like lot other reviews pointed out , noise level low-light condition annoying , give you watercolor-like effect . some pictures i took during visit monterey bay aquarium turned out completely dark ( prevent this beforehand , i even took photos same objects using several different settings , only get results bad , worse , worst ) . picture quality nowhere close my old old old sony cybershot t7 . i totally disappointed . if not my t7 broken , i wouldn't even wanna use this camera . even re-sell it other people , i would feel it like crime . after revisiting this webpage read more user reviews , i realized i must got defective item amazon . well . what i say ? it 6 months . bottom line : just careful when you received this item . some test shots . if anything looks suspicious , ask replacement . after all , all high praise here can't all wrong	-1
i really like size weight camera . it very easy use picture quality pretty good . i return cam because motor noise unacceptable . i recorded some scenes while skiing whiny noise very noticeable , even outdoors . all other reviewers claiming cam records motor noise dead . i spend bit more money get sony hcr-dc96 instead	-1
i purchase this instrument twice . first time there black specks lense , so it returned . second time worst , i.e. same black specs but thing didn't work all . i also checked this manufacturer other models out most come disturbing black specks lense . this isn't quality optical product	-1

i returned this camera after trying very hard like . picture quality ( movie or still ) totally unacceptable . i not even get one good still picture . forget indoors video or still . falsh video light useless . overall quality camera low .	-1
i spend hours pouring over reviews trying decide which ultracompact best deal best overall camera . end , it came down panasonic fx01 cannon sd600 . i read warnings other reviewers panasonic images weren't top quality , but i chose ignore those reviewers because paper fx01 looks like it would out perform sd600 . i wrong . after using fx01 few days i knew what those other reviewers talking - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera great , but it just wasn't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera amazon ( very easy-great service ) because poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs why you take photos , right ? i know someone sd600 he very happy quality . judging customer images sd600 page amazon , i think i should've gone cannon	-1
if you looking take high quality pictures , then look elsewhere . it nice taking quick snapshots family or what-have-you , but not much else . ( or beginner photography or child . ) you hold very still if you don't want your pictures come out blurry . also , flash makes images far too bright if you don't use flash it sometimes makes images come out far too dark . only thing i like this camera it size . it great just keep your pocket or your bag ... anyway , i'm buying better one soon	-1
just turned out ot more complicated set up than i wanted . never used . returned it	-1
i purchased this case my dscs90 . i hate it ! it only big enough hold camera nothing else . there no handle case , fact case only zippers you suppose use strap camera itself handle . zippers not stay place camera easily fall out case so i don't recommend doing this . look better case your new camera .	-1
least if your going decieve people lcd screen back , least make picture quality decent . i mean this barely qualifies picture . some pictures so bright it just looks like splash light . this sickening me because my daughter excited it broke her heart when i return it because she expected least able see pictures . definatly stay away this camera	-1
this waste money . my 5 year old loves taking photos . she uses my digital camera sometimes . i thought this would great gift her . she could see photos back camera like mom . this not case . lcd not project images it so small you not read what mode you . if batteries run out , it erases photos . i think they should made it directions kid friendly . my daughter frustrated quickly it laid drawer 3 months . if your child likes take photos , i would invest something else	-1
i bought this bag looking display amazon . but compare price i paid this bag not atall good . size small , extra pockets useless , where you cant keep much . camera pocket also not convenient . only plus point quality material used .	-1
i bought this item $40 online then found out my canon camera didnt need cannon brand charger i could bought one $10 instead . total i spent this charger which included shipping handling . not worth it . go store one $10	-1
my hunting buddy purchased nikon 800 . my intent put him shade . nikon kicks crap out my bushnell yardage pro 1000 . tried new batteries , tried bluffing , even tried lie but nothing helped this product past 500/600 yards . my opinion this product not worth postage . anyone similar opinion or someone good experience this product .

i ordered this mic after return ecmhs1 ( because it , reality , totally non-directional ) . well , this one actually directional , but it such pain use i wish i never bought it . 1st all , you should know this mic not work " smart shoe " available most sony camcorders - this means it not receive any power or transfer sound data camcorder through shoe . therefore it battery powered . this may seem like minor problem , but it means you need remember turn it off each time you video , otherwise you either soundless video or dead battery . believe me , some point you forget this . not smart shoe compatible also means you plug mic into jack camcorder - this real hassle if you small device trying loop cord around so it isn't way . ( my case jack under rather cheap plastic cover threatens break off repeated use . )( you might expect , i highly recommend you check whether mic smart shoe compatible . course , means mic doesn't need battery or audio plug - not it simply fit into shoe . it great feature . ) finally , while engineers sony some amazing things over years , they weren't able even half-decent job designing cap covers this mic battery . this cap fall off even slightest touch . this incredibly annoying . mine fell off several times - fortunately i always managed find it . i finally put piece duct tape secure it ( doesn't look great , but least color matches ) . considering high cost , this mic really bad investment . while non-directional mics most camcorders pretty pathetic , this very poor substitute .	-1
my husband bought me this camera my birthday may 2006 . i loved this camera . well , it stopped working christmas eve . i used it morning no problems , put it charger recharge later evening . when i removed camera evening , screen remained black . it would not take any pictures . after talking customer service folks , i sent my camera repair . it under warranty , i not anything break camera . well , they voided my warranty stating it " impact damage " my repair bill $111.00 . you got kidding . i called question voided warranty since i not dropped camera . technician i spoke explained " impact damage " could happen if camera bumped up something your purse . so i asked speak manager . i am sorry , but if i am going spend this much money camera , i expect little better quality . i called email kodak company several times someone talk me . nobody bothered return either my calls or emails . i would seriously think twice before spending money camera break no fault your own only warranty voided billed amount comparable brand new camera . i discovered quality product only good company stand behind it .	-1
bought camera recommendation , also what looked like good specs web . owned it less than two weeks when lcd screen cracked ( below surface protective cover ) . turns out this very common problem these cameras . panasonic not warranty fix this ! if you get one , or own one , very careful not use left nav button . if you , very careful pressure you apply . this camera glass jaw , you might end up " bricking " brand new camera . i am replacing mine canon	-1
i bought this camera after reading reviews wanted get camera uses different media type other than smartmedia ( which only lasts month ) . i would say i am extremely disappointed , particularly grainy images completely out focus edges . even all settings highest possible quality powershot sd1000 , my old olympus camedia c-2020 takes much better photos . it incredible how blurry edges surprised why no one mentioned it so obvious , especially other reviewer pro photographer . so blurry i use photoshop crop out left right sides . right side worse than left making 1/8th entire image unrecognizable . maybe i simply got one bad lens . any case , no thanks , i'll stick my trusty old camera . i would rather pay new smartmedia card each month .	-1
if you purchase this lens adapter xacti hd1a , you not able take still photos using built flash . adapter blocks flash causes black shadows bottom half your photos	-1
bought this case digital rebel xti , my first slr . instead 18-55mm kit lens i opted sigma 17-70mm lens . sad say , but case fits only kit lens .. rebel xti 17-70mm lens barely fits . so word cuation everyone , if you're planning anything other than kit lens , then don't get this	-1
panasonic very compact , very stylish sexy my wife called it , but photos very disappointing : they way noisy ! even if set lowest asa setting 80asa it just barely acceptable they get progressively worse anything above 100asa . colours good , it take very good videos , but still photos just plain bad when compared other cameras photoshop cs2 . course it easy understand why : native resolution images . if one investigates such things , notice panasonic only 72 dpi , same sony , canon improves this 180 , nikon 300 dpi . it not just megapixels folks , but how those megapixels recorded what resolution . obviously camera 72 dpi more noise than one 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking upgrading newer model , yourself favour . try 4 or 5 cameras same megapixel range good camera store taking photos same subject same light condition . set camera lowest asa highest picture quality jpg format , take photos , pop sd card into computer , compare images photoshop . enlarge full pixel size ( 100%) , look meta data same time you see yourself . what i , since i not very happy images my panasonic produced ! i this camera 11 months 20 days exactly , today i traded it nikon p5000 after evaluating over dozen models including leica d-lux3 10mp camera , driving sales persons crazy all testing spending 4 hours store , but it very educational them too	-1
after discovering makers great camera would only offer such inferior case , i some more looking . what i ended up pelican case . those not familiar these cases stop any camera/photo shop , they most likely carry them . they come many sizes simply airtight , waterproof high impact plastic case very snug fitting latches . inside solid soft foam you quot ; pluckquot ; fit what ever you want store case . i purchased 1300 my finepix 3800 . case easily holds camera , battery charger , mini tripod , 3 xd cards . they come 4 or 5 colors , used almost anything you want protect damage	-1
camera great camera.it one best kind camera its level . everything great that(perfect picture easy work ) but package i saw amazon add , remote suppose package comes it but it won't there not remute package it kind cheating ... careful this product if you think whatever written comes package but not .	-1
i this camera year . it nothing but problem . first , kodak easyshare software continuous problems . i spent hours trying fix it . still bugs it no matter what i . secondly , camera very unreliable . i wedding go this weekend i not trust it am taking disposable camera too . how i explain problems i ? there so many . camera misfunctions continuously . sometimes it nothing all . other times zoom lense not shut . you turn option selector even though it option you select you get option . i sometimes not even shut camera off i gotta take batteries out so ... if i even find batteries work camera . honestly , i call tech supoport told them problems i they tell me only kodak batteries work camera told me buy some . so i went nice camera shop they not sell kodak batteries . camera salesman told me kodak cameras junk brand battery should not matter . i believe him . so my camera which would not work ... i asked salesman help me out . it not work any lithium batteries ..... reusable or rechargable . he popped some alkaline batteries amazingly it worked . well , everyone knows alkaline batteries real short short life . my camera now not work either batteries . probably only kodak batteries .... maybe .... or maybe kodak wants get ten bucks out me . i personally don't even think pictures this camera takes any good . really , when people take pictures me this camera my eyes always closed . i am so anxious get rid this camera ..... well would but know i gotta fork over least $250 good camera . trying save money this ' disposable ' camera waste . stay away kodak cameras ! if you don't believe me get creditable camera magazine read reviews .	-1
i'm giving this 2 stars only because my daughter also this camera onher wish list . if not i would upset recieved wrong camerathat i ordered .........	-1
rated one star lack value . you buy same canon brand case under $14 higher capacity , imho better , albeit non name brand , 1200mah battery under $10 amazon . neck strap not worth difference .	-1
i one panasonic doesn't driver or processing downloads it or even respond requests . proprietary video format requires special handling your pc leave you camera full useless clips . they abandoning this product ? look panasonic website see yourself	-1
this good charger - quick portable . but battery life battery sucks !	-1
it sounds like good system if it worked . you cannot use this system or indoor camera if you or your neighbors within 300 feet : wireless computer network , or cordless phone ( 2.4 ghz ) , or microwave running . i'm not kidding - i can't believe this even passed testing . i think mobicam newer system you should investigate owning . those lots reviews . pay attention them	-1
decent camera , but not great . shark mode nice . housing looks good , but mine leaked ~ 20 ft ... camera dead time i got it out water . good news amazon processed defective product return rapidly credited my account week . net result one decent picture disappointing christmas present . next time i buy housing better camera . canon some nice ones	-1
i read other review , decided give it try . soon i recieve it mail , opened box , i realized this mistake . cheap quality binocular " high power " selling point . it came already broken two eye ruber pieces falling apart . you see how cheap glue used put it place ! it extremly heavy hold hands more than one minute nature observation . you constantly ajdusting focus . your fingers bumps focus bar while you holding it . indeed strap , case , lense protectors all cheap crap , annoying it all ~ ! i am taking this back , buying made japan " nikon eagle view " 100 times better . you get what you pay ~ !!!!!	-1
bag ok but you must careful if your moving around lot . extra batteries top zip compartment it really top heavy tips upside down while your shoulder if camera out it . velcro not hold it closed well either . my memory card fell out bag during one these episodes , thank goodness my husband noticed	-1
this best item i ever bought my camera . i lot walking my camera , thought i would use it walking stick , which i , but best part this monopod what i never thought would happen . my pictures never fuzzy ! i take low light photos they come out clear . i paid very little this item would never caught without it my camera . three levers bottom allow quick expansion all different lengths . carrying case allows this item packed next my camera without it getting scratched	1
i believe this one best lens $1000 . forget zoom lenses even if they . this lens far better than 70-200l my opinion . it very sharp f2 even more sharp 2.5 . zoom lenses you set f/ 5.6 better result f/8 match this lens . it very well built but not excessive heavy , come hood bag , but unfortunately , canon decided remove hard cases all lenses . combined tamron 1.4 teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality par any zoom lenses 189mm focal length . yes i know i lost convenience 70-200 zoom lens . but i am really happy i decide change plan buying 70-200is 135/2l+ 1.4 . this not only saves me money but also let me get better pictures , especially wide open . better portrait lenses , like 200/ 1.8 300/ 2.8 , would cost several thousands dollars . trust me , once you play primes , you not like zoom anymore . i am also using 24-70l shoot my small kid . after using this lens , i don't like it anymore thinking change primes someday , only reason preventing me doing 1.6 crop factor digital camera . 35mm/ 1.4 become 56mm which really not good . order amazon free shipping even though it says not stock . they shipped mine 2 days this happened before even though item stated " stock soon " . pros : very sharp f2 super sharp start 2.5 . very fast lens f/2very good bokeh ( background blurring ) . overall extremely good picture quality good contrast/color . smaller size , less weight black color compare those white 70-200s . it lens : best build quality , fast/quiet ring usm af ftm . cons : no hard case . no inexpensive . effective focal length 216mm 10d/20d/rebel/300d which little difficult use portrait	1
this one four cameras , only digital camera , i used learn portrait photography . class how take portraits not how use camera . i wanted graduate point shoot but consider my budget because i wanted slr film camera also . i got canon rebel ti packed two lenses . it made sense me purchase canon digital interchange lenses . my original choice canon digital rebel , however , my web search , i found eos 10d $750 no catch . there no required additional purchases scam when i called . this allowed me spend extra money i would spent camera accessories . since it digital , i am not shy trying out features . when i first got camera , some photos dark or very light . after tinkering around learning what sensor-indicators means i don't get anymore . 10d more camera than i need i'm sure i it long time .	1
this good , affordable uv filter protecting your expensive lenses . i leave it my lens all time . this particular filter ( l-39 sharp cut ) especially good wide angle lenses ( lt ; 24mm focal length ) , because its ultrathin profile , which prevents vignetting . i used regular filters wide angle lenses , very bad results . although this filter not multi-coated , i not found it big deal pictures i've taken . multi-coated uv filters cost 2x or 3x price this one , which i don't think worthwhile . all all , i recommend this filter canon or non-canon lenses	1
i'm very happy my speedlite 580ex , new dimension my photographic hobb	1
this , my very humble opinion , most useful , sharpest , just anything else good you think say , best wide angle lense ever produced anybody , anytime , anywhere . lightning fast that what you want when light low . my gal pal sara i often wandered caribbean islands dawn early light , she into shooting old homes . she particularly likes gingerbread homes marigot , french side st. martin . i swear she must them all her hard drive . it like obsession her this lens aids her passion , feeds into her manic desire try control light . she just loves it since i love her , i gotta love it too . seriously though , i've used lense quite bit myself it keeper if ever there one . you just go wrong canon " " lense , no siree . jack priest , sailor home se	1
i like using tripod my long zoom lens , this device really added my hobby . remote perfect taking pictures birds my birdbath squirrels other critters my yard . i personally don't like cables , i don't like dealing them . this just right my purposes . remote also better taking pics people . it much better than timer my opinion since i move people out easier more efficiently , taking pictures more quickly . this gives me so much more control than using timer .	1
i am very happy this set filters . price right they come carry case so you dont worry how you going carry them if you go lite , camera filters	-1
this lens works really fast . it great lens . captures color real depth detail my canon 20d camera	1
very happy lens , price definately right amateur like myself	1
i upgraded canon digital rebel ( grey body ) this because i ready take my photography new level . one thing i like most this camera it flash compenstation . i purchased 430ex flash it because i tired use built flash always getting those hard shadows wall	1
this excellent battery powers my canon 5d camera very well . although i haven't tested it against spec how many shots i get it , i've very impressed longevity it charge	1
this uv filter produces high quality pictures fraction cost many ather brands	1
make sure check compatibility charts verify your lenses work this before buying it since only handful series lenses compatible . if you already one or more these lenses though this nice addition . af only works lenses f/4 faster most camera bodies . you also give up little image quality putting this your lens camera body , but extra reach really nice	-1
this good tool , job well , serves purpose , but little overpriced canon keeps changing connectors , forcing us buy new accessories which wrong practice against consumer . i give 4 star because canon , not because product . if you willing pay it , it good product .	-1
ive gotten used disposable kodaks i got checkout isle walmart . problem those , though , they run out pictures pretty quick . last straw when we ran out film family reunion just cousin billy show us how catch lizard rubber band twinky . point i knew i needed upgrade . i ordered canon eos-1ds mark ii next day , [ ... ] feature first caught my attention powerful zoom . now when i take family picture , i like step back mile or two , then zoom snap high-resolution masterpeice . my wife always complains i zoom too close into big pores her nose , which i respond suggesting she use clean clear pore cleansing strips ( watch her upcoming review those soon ) . useful feature this camera continuous shooting mode . this where camera automatically takes pictures rapid succession , 5 per second . other day i set camera dresser , turned macarena , got wild . i then took individual pictures strung them together into animated flipbook . now watching myself macarena mere flip book away . man i dance . summarize , you lot fun this cam like i . definitely worth [ ... ] ! but remember , there [ ... ] comes it ; so make sure you fill item number clearly [ ... ] card , make sure you stay within space alloted form otherwise [ ... ] wont go through	1
very good rechargable battery pack . holds charge long time even if camera not used much . capable taking many shots plenty review time . very pleased it	1
this lens fantastic very fast . colors blow you away . 2.8 stop set very fast sutter speeds . i put this lens my reble xt i dont want take it off . love it amazon great .........	1
i bought rebel xt w/ 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before xti introduced , but that story . this my first dslr , i blown away results . but after initial euphoria , there always room improvement . my first choice 28-200 , favoring longer zoom over , but i found this one used penn camera got deal it 380ex flash , so decision made me . i like zoom range , it great framng portraits . if i need wider angle , i still kit lens . i won't make usual complaints herky-jerky zoom ring or rackety extension tubes , i prepared this these reviews before i ever saw lens . i'm no expert sharpness , still trying get myself dialed , but my shots so far look pretty sharp me . i no " " lenses compare , nor would i make comparison if i . my somewhat uninformed opinion , this great step up kit lens . this lens working guy afford most likely get great results . working guy , i'm extremely happy it so far , glad i made purchase .	-1
eos-1d mark ii digital this camera i use two months little hard use because it lot things . i am not proffecianal but i liked very much pictures best like any camera i .	1
this lens great . i've doing portraits just random snapshots it makes every picture beautiful ! only downside lack ability zoom . other than it great lens	-1
i highly recommend this super wide angle lens anyone wanting take landscape pictures , buildings or lots other stuff ! it so different than standard kit lens ( 18-55 ) . you won't sorry when you start learning all possibilities extraordinary lens	1
slightly smaller than charger comes s(40 , 45 , 50 ,... ) series cameras digital rebel series cameras . seems charge same time . feels bit more substantial , but that not saying much chargers come those cameras seem pretty flimsy . i can't give it 5 stars because it nothing more than chargers come cameras ( which i lost )	-1
holds all my lenses , camera body , remote , card reader , etc ... room spare . compares bags costing 3 times more .	1
i won kodak printer scrapbook convention then went hunt find refills reasonable price . purchasing 160 count made price per print lowest beat out anything i could find local stores . it great convenience able whip out 4x6 print instead download it store website , wait few days , go there pick it up , etc . great value	1
this lens gotten some bad reviews , i think , partly because it starting show it age . this first usm lens , technology really grown since then . if canon come updated 75-300 usm lens , man , it would blow everything away . said , yes , this lens little slow focus . but , if you not using it work like one professional sports photographers you see sidelines baseball games , you should okay . it also could use extra stop ( or two , or three ! ) because when you handholding , you need aperture open it . all this aside , i really gotten some gems pictures out this lens . it lets you get closer then you possibly could hope . if you asteady hand plently availible light , you get some really nice shots . if you low light situation ... you need tripod . lens works ... pretty good , but i number ever so slightly blurry pictures wouldn't there some more aperature room play . all all , its good starter telephoto lens , especially digital slrs since it really extends zoom those . its great price , when you decide upgrade one those white canon beauties , just sell it	1
lens fulfilled all our expectations quality portraits field view flexibility . stabilization aspect great help , although it doesn't compensate someone pushing shutter too fast low light conditions . highly recommend this lens standard use lens canon rebel xt	1
excellent product , easy use , great edging cards making trims cards craftwork . i can't wait experiment it	1
other than months waiting nikon deliver them amazon shipping , battery itself good deal . they work well , charge up easy hold their charge nicely . priced well , they cost less than same type battery than canon or sony . i bought them d80 older en-el3a would not fit . course i 10 older batteries my d70s rather surprised when they didn't fit d80 . basically same size shape , but keyed differently . i also surprised find 3e would fit d70s , meaning they backward compatable .	-1
this monopod great job my camera . you quick , easy-off , it attatches your camera screw , you press button side monopod just slide your camera right off it quickly . i wanted nice , inexpensive monopod my new zoom lense . i canon 35mm , i recently purchased 75-300 zoom lense it , i needed monopod stabilize shoot . if i knew then what i know now , i would buy it again . nice product	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	-1
i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	-1
sony it again ! fast charging long lasting , this battery perfect my sony cyber-shot camera !	1
i just got back vacation . i bad back , it sore . i very happy discover way this bag hangs , i could carry my nikon d-70 one or two extra lens very comfortably . gear super easy access bag provides nice platform changing lenses . i other bags which heft lots gear , they're great travel days occasional big shoot , but if you're looking hike ( separate way carry tripod ) , then this wonderful bag	1
if you shooting compact chip camera like 20d or rebel xt , you happier 8mm fisheye . this 15mm fisheye just really distorted wide angle lens due 1.6 factor . if you love fish eye style camera , you'll need something wider compensate your smaller chip . i disapointed this lens reason . sigma 8mm great . note reviewer below . sigma makes some good lenses bad ones . this good one you probably got bad copy . it happens often enough sigma gear . this lens , its good go try one your local camera shop make sure it style you want . bring your camera chip it take few shots go home check them out . decide if you like style if piece glass good copy . i got good copy still disapointed because my lack knowledge . sounds like you got bad one	-1
i am no means pro taking pictures , but this camera makes me look close it . so far i just used it point shoot pictures really good quality . i am tring learn more functions one i run across so far i enjoy you choose certain functions your photo black white , color , or sepia . i am not high tech but i use this camera pretty easily . my first digital camera canon digital elf only 3.2 mega pixels there huge difference quality pictures when you compare . so if you affored spend more more mega pixels it . only down sides i seen so far it doesn't come w/ great memory card which most not i imagine if i not small hands camera would little awkward handle . it lots buttons dials so you hold just right so you don't hit any . but overal i am very satisfied w/ my purchase hope become better photographer help this camera . canon cameras served my family i very well over years	-1
xti feature laden , but takes fantastic " point shoot " photos . seems significant improvement canon rebel xt , wonderful camera . money , best slr going	1
every picture mine included larger portions sky would these stubborn spores it . pretty infuriating , especially when you got shot just like you wanted it . yes , you always remove those photoshop ( or cheaper yet , gimp ); but isn't it cool when you look picture say : " it , nothing it ! " ?? it wasn't just sky . any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly acursed specks . this blower , greatly priced ( pity adorama doesn't free shipping though ) , i put my camera tripod , pointed it down , squirted three or four times - gone specs !!! great buy dslr owners	1
easy use , including zoom uploading computer . nice clear photos when printed out	-1
after checking prices all usual pricing bots , i found better price , including free shipping , going directly amazon . this lowest price not appear other searches , so it pays go amazon first . i replaced my canon sd400 casio find controls more logical use . this important if you don't use camera while , because you just pick it up start shooting without hunting manual . also , docking base much more convenient than plugging small cables into camera . you not remove battery casio charge it you canon sd400 . vga movie quality superior casio . still pictures appear equal . amazon delivered ups record time even weekend inbetween . i ordered friday received it following tuesday . go amazon !	1
there already tons reviews eos 300d ( digital rebel ) but i want share my experience camera , so i keep this short . i bought this camera 5 months ago i am love . i not new photography or slr , but new world digital slr . i previously used ancient minolta x-570 , " pro-sumer " 35mm film slr vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens . first foremost this camera takes excellent pictures , very high quality no distortion i seen . this camera particularly good beginner dslr because there so many options use learn . but until you ready take advantage all featues , you use this just like point shoot . battery life excellent so far : thought i would suggest getting extra backup long days taking photos . i also quite happy kit lens , which i wasn't sure i would like since it not versatile lens i using my minolta . but kit lens proved great learning tool : i able take some great shots , while also learning what kinds other , better lenses i would like add my setup . ** only issue i problem sandisk 2gb cf card . after 300 shots , camera froze stopped responding card . i able salvage most photos after fact , but don't risk it . if you're serious enough spend this kind money camera , spend little extra money sandisk ultra ii line high-speed cards .	1
i got this camera my 17th birthday last summer , it great . much i'd love canon powershot , it bit out my price range . all people who think using lcd screen runs out batteries after quot ; 2-4 picturesquot ; lying you . i bought rechargable batteries radioshack , i've taken up 400 picture without batteries needing changed . this good camera good quality good lighting . dark or overcast situations , it look bit grainy , but that easily photoshopped . i recommend when uploading , plug it into wall digital camera adapter , because uploading sucks all battery power right out . i recommend this someone who hasn't owned digital camera before , or someone wants good quality not-so-crazy price	-1
this lens exactly what it should . overall quality extremely good . take look my photos : - first photo without lens- second photo lens flash- third photo lens without flashthere few things note photos : - there substantial amount barrel distortion . this normal . try not straight lines near borders photo make it less obvious . - fringing exaggerated . you notice fringing ( purple or blue tints ) high contrast edges objects near borders . you see this regular shots but more exaggerated wide angle lens . - lens makes shadow when using built-in flash . you see shadow photo flash . darker environment , it very obvious . external flash only way fix this . couple details : - you get extender nice brushed aluminum here : http://www.lensmateonline.com/s2.html- camera setting ( converter ) indicate you lens attached . it not obvious what it but it indicated change image stabilization icon so i assume it affects way image stabilization works . overall , i recommend this lens	-1
previous review not completely correct . problem not product but description what amazon.com put up canon cpm-e3 battery magazine . it battery magazine canon compact battery pack cp-e3 not camera battery grip . i think product itself great thing , it lets you switch whole magazine 8 preloaded batteries instead replacing batteries canon compact battery pack cp-e3 . previous reviewer should not judge product incorrect infromation given retailer	1
canon three digital cameras $ 2,500 + . 1ds mark ii , 1d mark iin relatively new 5d . i chose canon over nikon ( which i've shot most my photographic life ) because canon more impressive suite lenses . here decision process i went through . most products , it comes down how you'll use it . all them tradeoffs . 1 . megapixels . more pixels - few caveats - translates into image enlarged ( cropped more tightly)with less deterioration . 1ds market leader 16.7 mp , 5d comes 12.7 mp 1d 8.2 mp . if you're commercial art or magazine photographer 1ds probably makes sense . if you're wedding photographer , 5d probably sweet spot . practice , however , difference pixels these cameras not make appreciable difference most people . 8.2 mp , you make 11x17 print 200 pixels/inch without any enlargement beyond camera native resolution . up size , you certainly won't see much difference prints three cameras . said , higher megapixels other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude . 2 . full frame . 1ds 5d full frame - means sensor camera capture view scene you're accustomed seeing your 35 mm film camera . 1d most digital cameras what called field view crop factor ( fovcf ) . 1d , it 1.3 . what means both viewfinder image sensor don't capture everying lens " seeing " - it crops view little tighter . result : your lenses effectively 1.3 longer . 70 mm lens becomes 91 mm lens so . because camera effectively " cropping " edges image lens produces , it also tends eliminate softness or vignetting appears edges some lenses . whatever camera you use , what you see viewfinder still what you get , it doesn't affect pixel resolution image . my 300 mm lens 1.4 extender 1.3 fovcf effectively 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory . ( if you're switching film digital , some your lenses may may no longer fit your needs focvf . your 35 mm lens no longer really wide angle 45 mm . ) 3 . durability . this most important me , though it may not someone who doesn't shoot extreme conditions or expects replace their camera two years . both 1ds 1d sport complete metal bodies , sealed against weather shutter last least 200,000 cycles . 5d - very solid camera - designed 100 , 000 , not weather sealed more plastic components . 4 . weight/size . what solid , metal body giveth durability it taketh away weight . those who prefer camera heft , these it . many people , this big drawback . 1ds 1d 43 oz ., or almost three pounds just body , without big battery . add battery you're 54 oz . 5d just 29 oz . 31 oz . battery . 1ds 1d , built-in vertical grips , also more than 2 inches taller . if you're looking something less obtrusive easier carry around , 5d it . 5 . speed . there reason 1d camera choice photojournalists , sports many bird photographers . it shoots smooth 8.5 frames per second , compared 4 fps 1ds 3 fps 5d . most day-to-day uses , 3 fps more than adequate . using both , i'd say 1d autofocuses bit faster , too . 1d 45 autofocus points , compared nine 5d . 6 . price . give or take hundred here or there , 1ds $ 7,200 ; 1d $ 3,900 ; 5d $ 3,000 . price determine whether you get 1ds or not . if you afford it , go it . otherwise , other features - or possiblity buying more lenses instead more camera - make your decision . what i decide ? first , i looked how i'd use camera : photojournalism , travel wildlife photography . higher fps not important me durability autofocus speed , so either 1d or 1ds would . end , i decided i'd rather spend money lenses would not obsolete next new improved camera . ( i bought 300 f/ 2.8 close difference price . ) so , i went 1d mark iin . if my camera generating some good cash flow or my wife didn't need new car , i'd probably gone 1ds . i'm very happing decision camera . most people most uses - general portrait , landscape travel photography - 5d probably way go . ( or perhaps next greatest camera canon announce later this year .	1
i bought 250d lens use my sony dsc-f717 it just wonderful . i also use it my canon g3 because i bought canon ladc58b conversion lens adapter ( which required inexpensive ) . i hearing lot good things this lens digital photography forums i seen many wonderful examples its use . i recommend this lens anyone who wants make their " macro " photography shine . get one ! just clear there 52mm 58mm don't confused which one fit your camera . edit : just clarification : this one ' ' " 58mm " even though above ( this page ) when you click links " see more technical details " " see all product description " it mentions " 52mm " . this misleading confusing . very very top this page it says " 58mm " . let me just assure you this particular one ' ' " 58mm " ' not ' " 52mm " . late edit ( aug 04 , 06 ): well , it looks if amazon finally corrected misleading info i mentioned just above my clarification	1

canon rs-60e3 all canon says it .... it simple one handed operation switch open flash , focus , then release shutter once , multiple times , or hold it open bulb exposure . although cord not long enough include photographer picture , it simple enough make " extension " allows very remote exposures	1
2 years heavy use - not even one little bitty problem . they've traveled well under harsh conditions , they still function wonderfully . there you go	1
i wish there also photo showed backside this camera case . if there i would known this excellent quality case unfortunately not belt loop which what i looking this product . great quality nevertheless	1
i , like many people , research high-tech purchases before buying because complexity items invariably high cost some items . digital cameras no exception . i looking replacement my konicaminolta dimage z1 . my requirements fairly straight forward : new camera 10x zoom , no less than 5mp processing chip , third , get my photography skills point camera after this new one could dslr . i read reviews here amazon regarding performance s9000 , while some them , i felt , right , others not read professional reviews before purchasing this camera . intended use this camera never point shooter . while s9000 possess automatic functions " streamline " use , these features whoafully inadequate overall optical proccessing capibilities fuji strove it design . let me clarifications ' sake say this loud clear : if you want breathtakingly beautiful , clear , vibrant pictures perfect exposure using this camera , then you must use manual settings . this not point shoot type camera !!!!!! out box s9000 godsend . not only images super sharp no hint edge fall off hampers other high res cameras , but exposure so perfect i question my ability luck . setups very easy controls functions snap . white balance shutter speed settings not easy concepts grapple potography , yet fuji made short work them their intuitive design . there really two photographic miracles work s9000 : one , processor captures detail color you feel guilty paying so little something better than much more expensive equipment , two , exposure so good if i not know better , i would think i using advanced film slr . this absolute rave this product . fit finish superb , ergos comfortable controls easy find use , it fulfilled my need camera would get me ready dslr but not too complex . only downside this camera it take time process image before exposure , but outside some dslrs , this problem all digital cameras . it true this camera big heavy , but then photographic perfection ain't free . home run fuji !!	1
black this same my camera , all parts together , this one professional looking set up ! i am not sure if this hood cuts down glare/reflection , i not used it sunny day , but i don't see why it shouldn't . cheap this little product , it pretty much must this camera ! ( s3 ) one last side note , should you alreay own extra lens or two . they happen metal , very carful screwing them into this plastic adaptor ! i made mistake put whole thing fridge hour , so metal would shrink , i could get pieces apart	-1
okay , first off , i'd like say this my first af slr -- i stepped up my dinosaur camera , canon ae-1 manual focus , right now i am quite overwhelmed all features this little thing . i'm still learning stages all this technology but let me tell you this , i am fun ! it amazes me canon offer quite impressive camera price . i just received my first few rolls developer pictures came out amazing -- so clear colors very vibrant . just let you know , i'm using 28-105mm f/ 3.5 - 4.5 usm lens . i took suggestions many passed up " kit " lens i'm sure glad i so . i would highly recommend f/ 3.5 - 4.5 lens , but unfortunately rest you , amazon discontinued it . but you could order it one many other photo shops ( bh , adorama , etc ) . i any regrets this purchase ? absolutely not ! i love this camera even though i've owned it less than month , i'm actually thinking stepping up eos 3 using this backpacking/hiking body . hmm ... what , what ? i purchase body or start collection l-series glass ? ... question .	1
not much add other positive reviews posted , other than i am user loves my d50 . it year now shot over 10,000 photos excellent results ( mostly landscape wildlife ) . excellent image quality hand grip fits perfectly both my hand my husbands . only con i think this time there no backlight top panel - this makes it difficult adjust settings low/ no light situations . also , people used little compact point shoot cameras this might seem little overwhelming first bulky carry around ( which why i little pocket camera my purse ) . i also got 18-200 lens love it - perfect walk around lens	1
although this good batch accessories , camera case itself little unhandy times . it no carry strap -- camera strap sticks out through slit top . so , if you want carry case strap you decide take picture , you must open case , pull camera strap through slit , then lift camera out . it would not keep me buying this but it make it unhandy	-1
canon bg-e3 battery grip one awesome extra you cannot without . i found extra weight size not even minor burden . i rec'd product 2 days after initial receiving date/17th st photo fantastic job ( once again )	1
i using this lens 2.5 years it exceptional piece equipment , especially price ! i very rarely feel need get closer image than i achieve this lens . it very solidly built i am sure it continue primary piece my kit years come	1
i used this charger battery package while now my digital slr , battery performance excellent ! downside charger issues : top bay charges faster than bottom bay batteries get very hot when charging , it not seemed affect batteries year i them . if you looking exceptional batteries buy these , charger okay , just beware it not charge all nimh batteries but most	-1

hi rebel extreme , needed use high-speed mode ... but flash couldn't even vaguely keep up . i taking pictures dancers , so needed flash system could keep up . speedlite really this perfectly - i'm able take rapid-fire sequence photos , this flash system there each time . i don't know if it really helps when taking single photo , but if you want flash keep up , this one great ! i like it so much , i'm planning buying one or two more my next shoot , run slave mode this one .	1
camera handles very well - it light drives my zoom lens 18-55mm lens beautifully . i get professional photographs use it all day without suffering heavy weight , which it not . view finder excellent readout back camera extremely helpful , showing photos they taken - zoom back screen , which immediately gives me idea photo i want use my books . i say this outstanding lens camera .	1
i use this gem my 20d my 24-105mm , far i'm concerned it one best optical lenses out there . my 24-105 isn't ideal indoor/low light lens nor it ideal sports photography lens ( although it sharp , just not quite long enough ) 70-200 fills gap my arsenal boot ! photos i've taken so far sidelines all keepers . if you afford it , it , you won't regret i	1
i needed this tripod use my 20x50 binoculars since least movement 20x magnification causes subject wind up outside viewing field . this tripod works well use . it sturdy , lots features reasonably priced . however , if you wish use tripod binoculars , right angle adapter needed . i found one ebay few dollars .	1
it good my title says , however , i found one con it there no place i put string it so i put it my pocket when i take it off	-1
digital rebel most amazing camera i've ever owned . my previous camera canon a90 i loved using all features it [ great camera ! ] . i decided recently maybe i should graduate slr because i starting get more creative my photography . i spent great deal time researching cameras finally decided digital rebel . after few months owning it i still am amazed . image quality fantastic , it quick responsive , every day using it i learn little more . it perfect intro slr camera me because everything makes sense it easy learn . i've gotten amazing shots i could never dream getting point shoot . if you finding yourself wanting little more than point shoot , go this camera , you wont sorry .	1
i started battery grip initially wanting double battery availability . used 35mm hand strap already realizing value stability such strap , this my second attraction purchase battery grip last but not all least , ability use shoot grip itself , allowing full ease rotation camera . though i never used battery magazine allows use aa batteries , it offers backup should canon batteries need charging i am heat shooting . i always travel my charge four aa batteries . i would recommend this grip standard accessory eos-20d eos 30-d . one thought consider once camera it increases overall height creating challanges some camera cases .	1
this great lens . i not want repeat all good things other reviewers written this lens . it not so heavy so i use tripod without using tripod collar ( costs 119.99 ) . this best value i ever got lens . now i can't wait get 17-40mm f4l too . you get very nice bokeh when wide open f4 5.6 , course depending how far background subject . people complain how ugly hood looks but subjective . i like it because it works great you attach it reversed position lens so it fit your camera bag . i think fit finish lens beautiful	1
not knowing fully what i getting into , whim i purchased this monopod hoping half-way decent product , i mean-it so cheap . i pleasantly surprised find how sturdy unit what i very high quality monopod . this my second monopod so i compare it ( other bought auction website ) . comparison opteka far better monopod height robust thickness i use it exclusively my minidv shoots	1
this my first very expensive entry into digit slr photography . i used canon point shoot digital camera previously . i avoiding dslr because i used rarely use my eos film slr . convienience point shoot experience overwhelming . unfortunately so it limitations . so back i came , only choice though expensive eos 5d it full frame sensor ! pain reduced double rebates . wow ! this revelation ! beautifull images , lot control . i notice af not fast my old elan iie . i also disappointed price there lack weather sealing . i am not happy canon this , but i really appreciate them making full frame sensor difficult marketable slot far their line up concerned . this camera also needs prime or lenses , because sensor reveal inadequacies inferior lenses . this add cos t.t his exceptional photographic tool i hope use improve my skill i explore all it capabilities	1
i purchased this case my canon a530 camera . i find it great job light , durable , compact . it keeps camera clean scratch free . however i wish case better carrying capacity . i would liked bit more space spare batteries chips . i use different ones different pictures or video . batteries tend give out after long day shooting convient extras would handy . case beltloops but not good shoulder strap times when belt not worn . bit akward . otherwise this case good protector my camera fits it well .	-1
i wanted get macro lens everyone told me this one get ... i'm so glad i . smaller sensor my 30d , 100mm more like 150mm or so , so it nice , wide-open telephoto/portrait lens well . i've uploaded few photos i've taken w/ this lens show what it capable macro telephoto . i thought 17mm-85mm usm lens came e/ my camera sharp - but compared this lens , kit lens might well diy pinhole camera . my less than perfect rating there no image stabilization available macro lenses . when i'm trying hone bees pollenating flower , there lot shake . i can't practically use tripod when insects bouncing bud bud , so i take 100 shots get one that not shake blur - i miss some really cool shots . addition lack image stabilization , i am frustrated w/ sometimes unpredictable focusing happen lens trying decide whether it should focusing telephoto or macro . i wish there switch lens make it macro only or telephoto only , so it wouldn't bouncing one focal length other all time . i've taken far more successful telephoto shots than macro . telephoto focal length bit long ( those us who cannot afford full-frame sensor camera ) most casual photography . i recently used this lens shoot some promo shots some massage therapists small eatery . i practically set up restaurant bathroom get photos i wanted , but opted this lens because it much faster ( 2.8 ) i wanted use natural light over flash . lens long heavy its range . addition battery pack grip , this lens added very weighty , so i may not take it w/ me my kit bag every shoot . once i add short fixed focal length lens moderate telephoto my kit , my guess this lens pulled out only special occasions . it tack-sharp , but it frustrating times	-1
i love bag all reasons others not like it . product listed gadget bag what it good . s2 large camera point shoot it fits very few bags . this bag fit camera easily space all types extras including batteries , chargers extra media cards . there also enough room small digital camera or film point shoot . correct way advertise this case would up two bodies or four small lens . given limitation , this great bag . bag very well made holds my canon powershot s2 very securely . i lay camera it back means even if i accidently power it lens opens harmlessly . material great waist belt very practical . strap well padded after day use i believe it one most comfortable straps i used . buy this bag correct camera you very happy it .	-1
got lowero slingshot 100 2 months ago , it really coming handy . main area , it holds my pentax digital slr one lens mounted , 1 rather small lens 1 decently big zoom lens ( 80-320mm ) , plus sigma ef-500 super flash . it packed there , flash just barely fits , but i don't need much more room . top compartment holds extra batteries , recharger , etc . really easy access main pocket when it my back ... just pulling case my front ( no need take it off my back ) . well made . zippers strong so i don't worry one loosening my equipment falling out . perfect amateur semi-pro photographer .	1
this lens amazing . nothing escapes it . it like black hole . clearly best lens i ever owned . it like lidless eye sauron lord rings . it heavy requires rethinking how you hold camera . it comes beautiful case , hood , tripod mount lens . believe me you need it . i took few photos my son 250 feet away they look great . i now get work reading small manual . it 2 focal settings 2 stabilizing settings . wow !	1
i think it very well could so i'm not going differ those who say it . i bought this use new 5d itt simply outstanding every regard . so far , i've kept it 5d can't bring myself take it off . i considered couple lenses , including 24-105 f/4 which lot appeal price same . but this lens i chose part because i already 70-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 lens overlap seemed waste while extra stop helps . i no regrets it . sharp tack quick . i note this not compact lens , especially hood it stretch out lot when you widen field . it also not light . this lens 5d give your neck back pain , assuming you work more than one camera . but focal lengths covered just ideal require none compromises longer zoom range require . , i've got 18-200 20d . 70-300 , while not , specs out range virtue real compactness , but it ' not lightweight . these two lenses cover just everything me . i keep 10-22mm 20d extra-wide shots . since writing initial review , i've since traveled several weeks this lens it fully lived up expectations . given difficulties travel these days , i am concerned problem not able carry it me -- not problem date except britain . but always possible . , despite weight , i might favor 70-200 f/ 2.8 usm second travel lens- i like brightness focus . one suggestion . there temptation use this lens wide open lot time . it very good sometimes that best thing . but i've also found this lens makes beautiful images stopped down good deal short night time exposures tripod remote release . effect lights , etc . considerably different extended depth field .	1
it great compact camera good zoom . i now leave larger lens my nikon dx 70 use this closer shots . you need try different settings make sure you get color you want . i really like it most general quick shots , carry it wth me most time	-1
i camera w/ 12x optical tons features but i wanted something compact ready take quick snaps . this fits bill . my recent vacation i impressed how quickly it booted up focused get those unplanned shots . x-large screen makes it really easy see if you got good one image stabilisation seems work better than my previous camera ( canon a80 ) ... either or my hand steadier . last but not least - battery life impeccable . i took nearly 200 photos , plus spent lot time reviewing showing off pics friends no need recharge . battery ' custom ' one which concerned me but charger very compact travels well . it integrated prongs fold flat when not use - no cables :)	1
i just got this camera month ago i am satisfied it . it lot features despite its size . point shoot i say it great buy , comparable other power packed cameras , it even takes better pictures sometimes . but i just give it 4 because i thought i could more it . but you can't much settings since it it own default settings certain conditions . but over all it great camera . if you're just after taking normal pictures you want something sleek , this definitely good buy .	-1
despite reading glowing reviews this lens , i still surprised see how well it performed . lens so sharp you get very good cropped pictures running athletes , distance three quarters football field away , shooting hand held , late afternoon light , which print 5x7 still look like pro took them ! if you want tack sharp lens indoor sports pictures can't afford , or otherwise not want long lens outdoor sports pictures , then you should give this lens your serious consideration .	1
i use this little gadget mainly macro portrait work . when you it light emitting flash diffused which gives you more flattering less contrasty light illuminate your subjects . unless you going very shadowy , high-contrast , image this diffuser save day . it very light weight easy pack small places , so you should never good reason leave it behind . sometimes it simple things make biggest difference photo , using this defiantly make very noticeable differences	-1
love this battery . long lasting just good name brand	-1
i took this me recently australia shot landscapes well others , pictures came out better than film cameras i used recently , plus you don't need scanner . this camera works great , must semi-pros . pros , wait new 1d . pictures come out great 11quot ; x17quot ;	1
first thing make sure which lens you buying . kit lens comes canon 20d , 30d , 300d , or xt lower version , non usm one . higher version usm ones , you see red color " usm " front lens . according reviews , compare non usm ones , optically they same . however , usm motor focus faster much quieter . people complain build quality . actually i feel it really not bad , much better than canon 50mm 1.8 ii . usm auto focus performance fast , never hunt , much quieter than 50mm 1.8 ii . it fits nicely xt . not compare this hundred dollar lens other lenses cost three times or more . we compare apple apple . if you know limitations this lens use it wisely , images come out nicely . 1 . this not lens indoors low light conditions . if you need take lots indoor pictures flash not allowed , go get different lens . ( example , i use canon 50mm 1.4 this kind situation . ) 2 . distortion 18mm quite bit . avoid taking strait lines ( like buildings ) pictures edge while wide open . however , this easily corrected computers . 3 . step down aperture f8 or f11 , resolution improved lot even corners . overall , performance very good hundred dollar lens . it very light weight highly portable while traveling . this fits my needs cheap but fast good image quality walk around lens .	-1
i'm very pleased this small unit great deal power . it compact , not heavy , adjustable power output simply spinning wheel camera left or right . addition light output , head tilted so light direct or bounced , excellent feature . getting up running this unit breeze because i am totally " brochure reading averse . " twenty years ago i photographer big equipment , but given up both . i surprised control one such small relatively inexpensive unit	1
this great camera . plenty resolution . excellent shot speed . sturdy frame . kit lense doesn't camera justice . buy body separate add better lense . bad side , i small glitch camera firmware soon after purchase return it fix . it two months before camera returned . sorry , canon ... you lose star	-1
this lens only two " faults . " first , it big heavy -- quality construction often yields heavy lens . second , once photographer seen results this lens produce , there likelihood he or she unhappy other lenses camera bag . results first : images razor sharp this zoom mounted my nikon d70s . i get shots i never could get before because this lens so crisp subjects taken distance nevertheless cropped produce acceptable close-up image . subjects taken more normal distances breathtakingly sharp -- if shot excellent prime lens . this fast lens ( f/ 2.8 throughout its entire zoom range ) . almost more importantly , this lens best " bokeh " i ever experienced lens . " bokeh , " extent i understand concept ( it japanese word meaning roughly " unfocused " ) , word describing whether out-of-focus portion image ( i.e. blurred background photo which only subject focus ) pleasing look it . this lens produces wonderful , creamy bokeh . sharpness bokeh , combined excellent bright color rendition this lens , makes this one true classic . i occasionally experienced minor ghosting this lens when shooting into very bright subject , i.e. sun reflecting off ocean . this normal shortfall zoom lens comprised multitude elements , i sometimes experienced this . but such occasions rare . autofocusing action this lens very good . even birds very long distances usually produce quick , snappy autofocus lock my nikon d70s . very seldom it " hunt " af lock , these occasions likely due operator error rather than lens . this lens also features vibration reduction ( vr ) which enables it produce acceptable images below what f/ 2.8 lens would otherwise suitable . vr really works , too , although it no means panacea dim lighting . this one nikon professional lenses , quality construction excellent . critical mount metal , entire lens built like tank . lens comes nice squeeze-style lens cap , very good lens hood easily reversed storage . reader see i am extremely enamored this lens . reason , notwithstanding its bulk weight , this lens produces best nature shots i ever managed take , far .	1

i am professional photographer , i owned this camera nearly two years . i also d70 backup . batteries go forever , it very quick respond , images beautiful , it typical nikon durability reliability . if you already nikon user , controls fall easily hand . said , computer software this camera joke . best image quality shoot raw files , color balance grey card , render images software like capture one le . uselessness included software only reason this camera gets four instead five stars . come , nikon , real !!! shortly after i got my first d70 , i shot model small photo side bar catalog . i got ugly feeling my gut when i told designer taken shot 3/4 figure , cropped head shoulders , enlarged image cover 8.5 11 catalog . time i found out , it already printer . it turned out , i pleasantly surprised : cover shot looked great . after incident , i trusted this camera always pleased results . this camera better than 35 mm every way except response shutter button . resolution color reproduction it more comparable medium format film camera . it imperative shoot raw process files properly get most out this camera . i can't wait try d80	-1

photos excellent . but photo print quality depends very much print shop . same photo file , it look like 4m photo when taken below quality printer shop . photos taken indoor marginal lighting ( no flash used ) turned out yellowish . battery life very long despite its large 3 " lcd . battery charging time over 3 hours - too long . photos files viewed computer looks just great . 8'x10 ' prints great but not tried larger prints . touch screeen control delight very easy choose set . date photo red ( would better if it black ) . location date not far right hand corner	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet . i use this filter my 50mm f/ 1.8 lens my 18-55mm lens .	-1
i went taking camera out its packing taking professional quality pictures twenty minutes . it amazing	1
i use my canon 10d mainly astrophotography . most time , it involves keeping camera shutter open long periods time , anywhere few minutes tens minutes . this ack-e2adapter takes my worries away monitoring battery status or drained one , while i control camera remotely sitting inside my house . continuous power also ensures worry free writes its flashstorage . package included several ac power connectors which very useful while travelling . amazon provides wide range items choose .	1

i am only amateur photographer , but still . . . this small camera long nose gives performance one might expect slr film camer costing lot more , lot more complicated use . i caught digital bug sevearl years ago . my latest before this beauty simple little canon sureshot 3mp . great camera , but this camera same simplicity , but takes pictures which much more refined terms sharpeness not much more than i paid camera four years ago !! this panasonic lumix leica lens , which ' matched any other camera but it twin leica camera -- much more expensive piece equipment . long lens might put you off if you average family photog , but if you want all around 35mm-12x camera without huge heavy expensive bag lenses , like me , this baby you . it only looks massive . it quite lite manageable . i use it bird photographsy , but it could great any situation where you need get really close up just any lighting situation ultra-fine resolution . don't want spend mega bucks mega-camera ? this answer . i love it , i think your , too . easy use , easy wallet . if you're not quite there , try next model down , same focal length but 6 mp , couple hundred less . terrific buy . no , i don't work panasanic . i'm retired print editor . jim isha	1
hawaii , i spend plenty time water ... so underwater housing my camera almost necessity . i very happy results , shooting water ( snorkeling , etc ) above water ( surf footage-just watch out water spots lens ) . some my photos up view other parts page this housing . i treat things pretty roughly , using this year no problems . i am water it almost daily basis . i like able use all features camera ( minus downloading images or changing battery or cf card ) while camera housing-something you cannot always say when looking aftermarket housings non-canon manufactured . everything mates up cleanly works great , i am very happy my purchase . just remember rinse it off/soak it freshwater after taking it ocean or pool keep corrosion bay , put little light silicone grease o-ring trouble free use	1
any one tried compatible battery power101 ? i can't believe price . i am struggling btwn buying sony brandbattery compatible ones	1

we canoe/kayak down various rivers creeks . i wanted way take my $1500 camera water without fear damaging it . sports pack completely water proof ( up 7m ) . i've submersed case test real-life situation camera stayed dry . case not cause any noticeable reduction picture quality . it relatively simple operate assemble . you only basic functions camera while case , so you need change any setting camera before putting it case advanced camera features not able used . my only concern scratch resistance plastic over lens area . so far i haven't any problems but i've only taken river 30 hrs . all told , i'm very pleased if you plan filming or near water i would recommend this case	1
its size price , this little light can't beat . very transportable produces dramatic influence image quality evening shoots indoors . i think this must camcorder owners . my vhs family movies shot over 20 years ago still source pure joy , so i see this miniscule investment long-term return .	1
started less expensive bag last january ( dec . now)and i'm shure glad i didn't . money this bag good one . it not flimsy you get out it pockets easly . tripod holder top real convenient	1
i bought this my new hdv fx1 camcorder , it works great . unlike century wide-angle lens , this fully zoom-through . lens . 8x , which less than century others , but just right hd -- since fx1 already pretty decent wide shot when zoom fully backed out , this just gives it extra boost , converting camera view roughly 35mm lens 35mm camera 28mm . also , very little barrel distortion . all great lens . only drawback it big ( heavy ) lens , but then , hey , it serious prosumer camcorder	1
overall , i am quite satisfied usability photo quality canon 710 . this camera upgrade my 3-year-old hp 935 -- old guy still worked fine , but very slow didn't handle low-light situations very well all . i also looking bigger zoom range . after weighing options , i decided 710 way go . pros : - uses standard aa batteries . invaluable when you're go need more juice . also , battery life very good - i'm using same aa rechargables i used over year my old camera , i routinely get 2-4 days usage them before needing recharge . - huge lcd screen doesn't suck power . fast response , too . - digital zoom actually helps ! because camera 7.1 mp image stabilizer , i actually get usable images even full 24x combined zoom . very impressed . - very wide range available settings . you customize almost any aspect this camera , sounds shutter speed flash speed/brightness focus .... - big enough , small enough . it fit my back pocket most time , but it big enough remind me it there before i sit down . - fast processing time . taking 3 or 4 minute video it ready go again less than 5 seconds true novelty me -- my old hp took forever ! fast processor also helps viewing images camera - you scroll through very quickly , also jump image very quickly too . much better than previous canon models even . - memory backup battery . remembers what day it , time it , what image you're -- even if you take regular aa out . very useful . - fast start-up time . it ready take picture right after you turn it , especially if you bypass " welcome " image sound screen . - cool features , like color swap color select . also , there option when camera connected your computer set any image your computer wallpaper just press button camera . camera also allows you use digital zoom while taking video , nice touch . - you change lenses add filters very easily . cons : - i mentioned earlier , one reasons i upgraded hp better luck low-light situations . i've camera now just over month , i still haven't figured out best setting clear , low-light photos -- something very easy older canon models , say , 510 . mentioned , there wide range settings available , which also negative if you don't know quite what you're looking . - no " action " setting . similar above , one setting i miss most other canons action setting . this camera requires you set it manually . - video file sizes . typical 4-minute clip run upwards 200 mb -- making it almost impossible send via email or upload anywhere online . also takes up good chunk 1mb memory card , really quickly . canon would better use mpeg-4 here instead avi . - similarly , video quality doesn't reflect large file size most cases , though sound quality very good . - big lcd great , but very hard see outside sun . it backup optical viewfinder , but using puts your nose up against lcd leaves nice smudge it if you're not careful . - buttons still somewhat confusing after month use , but that relatively minor undoubtedly pass time . - bundled software not offer ability resize your images -- i go back through old hp software if i want take image down 3000 pixels wide 600 ! overall , mentioned , camera huge improvement my old hp , even all those little annoyances , i'm sure camera would perfect fit pretty much any amateur-to-intermediate photog . it no slr , but it getting there . , you certainly can't beat price	-1

i bought this camera more than half year ago . my intention get decent camera images , but then also able use it filming short movies . i'm very pleased its performance . good lighting conditions , colors come out amazing . i really really not expect them so vivid sparkling ! darker conditions , well , it still works fine , not nearly bad i expected some other reviews . photos might grainy or not vivid anymore , but stuff still perfectly suitable show photos people . filming , it terrific . i mean , resolution great ( sth like 848 640 or so ) , better than what one could possibly expect regular camera . quality super awesome , looks very neat computer screen . respect . it pointed out you cannot zoom while filming , but not many cameras out there . oh , it also very small gigantic screen great battery life . great buy	1
installing software piece cake , using it quite matter . basic introductory instructions easy enough but after it seems require phd mathematic astrophysics get round all available toggles , tweaks options . first attempts ? moon came out real nice , but saturn white blob no fine detail . nothing like type pics super-whizzkids proudly display celestron site . go back night school one day you might see my fine efforts published well ( oh - using it classic lx200 good see'ing conditions - sorry celestron !	-1
we canon powershot s50 3 years ago , loved it . so this time when my husband wanted buy digital compact camera , we specifically looked canons . we originally thinking getting sd 700,800 or something like . but after we compared these cameras together store near us . we found out sd900 finest lcd display , more opitions control panel ... so we came back bought it amazon ( our favorite online store ) . we used it our last trip grand cayon , lv , sf etc . this sd900 takes very good pictures , especially good lighting conditions . colors also smooth rich . downside , you may already read others ' reviews , no battery indication , no raw(it ok , my husband doesn't much editiing anyway , it too much ask campact camera offer ) , control panel sensitive ... don't get frustrated if you happened pressed wrong button couldn't figure way out during time shooting . stich great function which comes , but when very bright area , you not see stich alignment very well lcd screen ( i guess it common trouble all digital compact cameras which relay lcd dispay ) . overall , it wonderful camera , we love it . it my husband camera , i uses canon 350d , but i borrow it my husband sometimes because it tiny compares my 10 lbs " moose " it takes very good pictures .	1

it wonderful piece equipment . love it . wish they made one larger objects	1
i've it several weeks now it seems like great camera . i am still learning new features . i would highly recommend it	1
yes , i am slow make this review , maybe because i spend great deal time using this camera . only thing i would like changed , rechargable pack . first i burned thru many batteries . i switched rechargables , find i still use great deal power , ( i shoot often flash , ) but now i recharge spent batteries after each session . i use charge 12 aa 3 hour shoot . i use this camera studio work it served me well good number years already	1
really cool digital picture frame , very simple use supports all types memory cards even pen drive	1
most carrying case made either fake leather or some kind neoprene material , this one really different . rigid structure also seem great job protect camera . there also belt loop d-ring feature which great .	1
ok ... i don't know who reviews batteries but this one pretty good .	1
camera great because it small enough slip into your pocket take wherever . i main picture taker our family vacations ge t-t ogethers . we 10x optical , 5 mp kodak camera worked well , it just big bulky , never fit pocket . 10x optical zoom v610 also works well , lenses never protrude camera when i use optical zoom . viewing screen large very clear . menus very easy navigate camera editing tools great . it would also make fine camera beginner . panorama function works very well also . i used it multiple times ease it created great pictures . camera turns quickly time pressing button photo capture quick . i camera month now best thing small size without compromise zoom , picture quality , or functionality . lcd screen take up some more battery than other cameras just because it larger , but don't let stop you getting camera . you able take least 70 or so pictures battery lot more if you conservative . my only small frustration when going skiing , i attempted video my brother coming down slope using 10x optical zoom image stabilizer . it night only lights , camera wouldn't focus him until he close , but may just because low light conditions glare snow . otherwise video worked flawlessly . there even terrific function allows you pause video any time during playback create picture video frame .

only two drawbacks this lens it requires huge amount light take quality photographs it relatively slow autofocus , especially where there not adequate light . aside this it good but not great lens . it probably worth money it cost , however , i believe better lens would 70 - 300 mm vr which costs 4x price this lens	-1
i've owned p-73 two years now . one thing i'm noticing couple digital cameras amazon reviews , after year or so , camera some kind error or just dies completely . me , this hasn't happened this camera . it always great , it lot really convenient features . when i bought this camera , i knew nothing cameras . i just wanted one really bad some reason one day went out bought this one because it pretty . i got really lucky -- i mean , i only bought it because it pretty -- i knew nothing it . but , nonetheless , i got lucky bought this camera takes aa batteries , came battery charger its own usb cord . it ton settings it . now i understand more photography , i really like manual setting -- slowest shutter speed 30 seconds compared 10-15 seconds even newer cameras its class . like i said , i never any problems it . batteries always lasted long ; took little time recharge . i never even bought memory card this camera -- i use lowest resolution take pictures because that all given memory card hold , my pictures still decent quality . i'm now looking into new camera because i want excellent image quality , , ironically , ever since i've shopping new digital camera , my sony overexposing underexposing 20 percent shots i take ; weird . anyway , if you're looking buy sony digital camera , based my experience this one , i'd recommend brand	-1
this why sony hot ! this sexy little ( yes its really small size pack cards ) it takes perfect clear crisp pictures battery life long 320mins perfect vacation , make sure get memory stick it though , because w/o it it only holds 15 pics . this my first digital camera i would definitely buy sony again	1
5 stars ... easy use . screen large clear . automatic settings include variety scene selections ( ie beach , party , fireworks scenes ) . i yet use video , so i cannot comment . i think this great all-around camera , it fits smallest purses ... big plus . screen yet get scratched all my purse juggling . my only complaint would shipping . i paid extra expedite my order since i leaving country few days later . it sent via ups signature " person " required . when i missed ups first time , i unable just sign paper leave it my door . i contact ups find out when they would return so i could sign person , which ordeal . i wish i would've known camera sent this way . i would've requested no signature required .	1
just gone back using film camera digital ( my wife still uses digital ) i found this excellant camera so far . i taken 6 rolls film everyone one came out perfect . i would recommend it	1
i got nikon laser rangefinder chrisymas it 8x magnification . i found this powerful golf . i could not hold it steady flag . 6x magnification bushnell yardage pro scout much better . also it very compact stores easily my golf cart . price amazon well below i could find anywhere else .	1
i bought this camera something bit more capable , but not expensive slr . zoom equivalent 300 mm lens slr , i certainly saved myself heap money over buying slr setup same capacities . i use this camera mostly manual . my aim buying it - get more proficient using manual settings . few times i switched it auto , haven't all impressed . autofocus seems little unpredictable , but there single press manual focus button left side , well focusing ring , these me very well indeed . i don't think i would recommend this camera someone who wanted use it mostly point shoot . it loses one star mostly because its poor macro capability . really really good closeups it just doesn't come close my konica minolta dimage z6 . i bit lost without image stabilization first . this camera compensates not this jacking up film speed when auto , if i want use it manual handhold , course i same . since i use tripod lot , this not too much issue me . i've heard lot bad press graininess higher iso , but i found them least good film if not better . colors great . i love my range menu options , though there nothing too extraordinary them . this camera more buttons than some , but once i got used them , they make my selections so much faster when i am shooting changing light conditions . i like fact i use cable release this camera . i used it quite bit low light work , fact i dial it right down twenty second shutter speed or even fantastic . i've found it pretty hard find image editing software work directly raw images this camera . it working really well me prosumer camera . however , i still think if i could go back , i might go panasonic dmc-fz50 10.1 mp instead . maybe . i would check one out more thorougly first	-1

this well made head constructed solid metal nice finish . there no plastic parts even rubber piece quick release plate hard rubber . i used it every week two years no problems it . i use it mainly attached monopod sports photography videography . quick release clever locking mechanism prevent accidental release . i bought extra quick release plate so i switch two cameras . tilt only -- no swivel : amazon ( others including bogen ) calls it swivel tilt head , but seems imply it moves two directions -- tilting ( up down ) swivelling ( side side or panning ) . this head only moves tilting direction which allows you orient camera either landscape or portrait modes . tilting action could improved if head clicked into upright position when you tilt it back landscape . when you going portrait mode , there no problem since it stops 90 degrees . however , when i want go back landscape , i hold it out look it see if it level . subtle click know i'm there would nice	1
i am really enthusiastic this lens because it excellent accessory my camera very convenient price . i add it use it landscapes , mountain views , nature images such , also group pictures family photos . it what supposed : it increases field view while keeping whole image very clear , this way pictures appear more natural -- whole view not narrow frame -- perspective deepness also , quite similar it seems me what i see my own eyes . very useful additional tool	1
i not yet used fz30 or fz50 , but i think this thing beats pants off fz5 or fz10 far image quality concerned . really nice camera . nice dslr type feel . 71% people check out fz20 here actually end up buying fz7 , ( today ) but i not believe iq fz7 could hold candle fz20 . buyers may * more megapixel * bandwagon . you lot 5 megapixels . i found iq fz20 very close dslr	1

i got pair these christmas . initially , i skeptical quality inexpensive roof-prism optic , this isn't my favorite brand name either . but contrary my expectations , i've extremely impressed them so far . good brightness , contrast , sharpness , field view , close focus all exceeded my expectations binocular this price point . feel , fit finish all very good . i wear eyeglasses , these binoculars still deliver nice wide view through eyepiece . twist-down eyecups quick extend / retract if you sharing these someone who doesn't wear glasses . they come decent carry case , relative porro-prism types , weight compactness both little bit better . if you looking good binocular birding or general use , i highly recommend you take look through these addition other popular models . i think these really hit sweet spot price / size / weight / performance , i'm very happy them	1

nikon always leader photography/ camera/ lenses . others nobly tried but nikon remains high bar others only hope reach . when shift film digital began , there some speculation if nikon could keep up competition . well , rest assure not only they kept up , they continue lead way . latest example this d200 . like d70/ d80 - this solid piece equipment . just feel it tells you you holding excellent piece technology . but proof always end results again , combination nikon know-how nikon lenses lead even beginner come up excellent pictures . gone " lag shots " . you fire up shoot multiple pictures seconds so action shots all yours . without even " tweaking " picture computer program , you print top line photos home . people cited cons : expensive . yes . camera come hefty price tag but it should kept mind this piece machinery intended serious photographers . if you " vacation holiday " picture taker , then you should elect buy cheaper camera . same true difficulty multitude small buttons , dials switches . there too many they overwhelming but only someone who " point shoot " school picture taking . anyone else relish options nikon provided us d200 . room improvement ? well , battery life nowhere near good d70 which i upgraded but weak complaint you still get hundreds shots one charge . also , it would boon if flash would automatically pop up when needed like former models . so if you serious photography always one ready , this one you	1

all , i just purchased sp-550uz after searching best camera bang buck - olympus fills bill ..... 3/3/07 my first day use i decided check all features - batteries supplied - still use 2gb card - i took off outdoors began shooting pictures local park - 300 pictures - including several 15 fps 30 fps shoots three videos - 15 , 30 45 seconds length . i am not pro using this camera sports , vacations every day family events . no cons yets - i love " scn " feature - just select how you want take picture camera setups camera - all you take picture	1
i've using 35mm slr cameras over 30 years . last 9 or 10 years i gone through several under $400 digital cameras technology improved . this kodak z710 very economical compromise . built-in 10x optical zoom great feature . z710 not image stabilization ( is)as some more expensive models but if you moderately steady hand you press shutter button rather than pound it ( whole camera ! ) that not really problem . feature this camera i really appreciate manual settings position which allows much more creative control shot . check out kodak web site more information this . i bought this camera amazon dealer less than $200 shipped me . that cheaper than reconditioned unit ( same model ! ) recently sold ebay	1

this really nice compact camera canon . picture quality excellent . i tried some night/day shots pictures great . zoom pretty much non existant 3x however depends what you use camera . build quality excellent i really love 3 " display . i find ipod like controls very convenient too though it takes some practice get used it . camera very compact but i never problems get good grip steady hand . images excellent true color indeed sharp . i would definetely recommend accessory kit this camera which includes nice small leather case extra original canon battery its available amazon . accessory kit turns out cheaper than buying individual components its contains original canon parts especially extra battery . also get sd card large enough memory . what comes camera ( 32mb ) really waste . still don't understand why these camera manufactures throw such small memory card . but overall great easy use smart looking camera produces wonderful results	1

we bought this camera because our other digital camera ( sony dsc-h1 ) too large carry around lot time . we took it skiing us ( whistler , bc ) it took some outstanding pictures , both persons landscape/scenery . it small enough you pretty much carry it anywhere , anytime . others may disagree , but touchscreen menu controls easy use fairly intuitive . fingerprints get screen but you hardly notice them they easily removed ( or better yet , use little wand they give you camera instead your fingers , doesn't leave any marks screen ) . summarize : this excellent camera , very small size but large 3 " led display , takes excellent pictures , touchscreen menu easy use intuitive . most people very happy this camera if they buy it . only negative thing this camera not view finder , but unless you very bright sun your back this isn't too much problem .	1
i've purchased other bags but this one beats all it great price	1
i bough this waterproof case trip st. thomas over christmas . photographs we took came out perfect . flash diffuser worked well , eliminating air bubbles normally captured underwater cameras . make sure you set up your camera underwater mode so it automaticlaly adjusts your color balance . only problem i since it so compact , i often accidently would move switch movie mode . this ruined few photographs , but also made great movie sea turtle coming up air . i know it expensive , but much cheaper than buying new camera or buying multiple disposable underwater cameras x-ray machines fog up pictures	1

good product , like price . this much less expensive than current pinseeker 1500 models , i bought it ebay used $150 so you may able find it less ( look under hunting golf rangefinders this model ) . this not pinseeker feature newer models but normal mode scan mode work perfectly ranging flags no reflectors ( although you may need try more than one time relatively stable hands ) . i able range flag 270 yards , able range top telephone pole 375 yards ( but it windy so flag straight out little cloudy ) . i would estimate this work ranging flags calm sunny day ( these don't work well sunny day because laser used visible light laser gets little interference sunlight ) 215-230 yards flag ( which what i need it ) . less expensive alternative than pinseeker , i really like performance , very impressed .	-1
i bought this camera my 80 year old mother because i knew if she going try digital photography , it easy ! printer dock simple her use transfer snapshots her cat her computer email them her friends . i used older cx-7300 , ( very similar camera ) backpacking years it never failed under harsh conditions . lack optical zoom plus me ; less break . c530 more compact , better resolution , still option using aa batteries when rechargables die . if you want simple digital snapshots , you love this little camera	1

camera short time grown love its features capabilities . purchase 50 mm-200mm telephoto zoom lens ; price it nice lens . i tried image stabilizer shooting picture air conditioner my neighbor roof using 200 mm telephoto . when you enlarge image you read label brand name ! without image stabilizer , it blur . i same book 100 ft away using 200 mm setting . without image stabilizer title blurred ; image stabilizer it sharp . very nice feature you take image then enlarge portion it save , or use filters make them bw , soft , more bright , or different color tones . people report under tungsten light auto setting gives yellow tone without flash . this true . however , you use mode , which like auto mode , reset white balance easily tungsten light picture comes out nice !. great low light capabilities image stabilizer . if you into action photography , this may not camera you . it limited ability store sequence photos without delay . other camers react faster larger capacity . reset default bright natural tone . you this some modes , but not all . read manual , it really empower you many nice capabilities . newer lenses light small interface image stabilization system automatically	1
i'd love read review anyone who purchased this camera , aiptek zoom dv-6 mp image stabilizing camcorder w/3x optical zoom . i see claim it 3x optical zoom cannot help but question this because i am unable find this product aiptek-dot-com this cam supposedly available since july 30th , 2006 . am wondering what gives ? please someone , post review this model hopefully , some picture results too . let us know this 3x optical zoom , please ! i pick rating , so four star rating based mpvr version this camera -- which i own find very decent gadget . mine over year old still going strong - no problems model . mp3 sound terrific . i convert movies viewing camera while go ... " wow " its quality . i recorded sounds more . very decent ! just drag drop my files my pc sd card i switch out movies mp3 . i am happy model , but it not any optical zoom - just digital . still get pretty good pix tho , just use various settings ... my little homemade movies good , very decent , but without additional lighting , indoor movies dark . this camera doesnt handle well strong sun - i use umbrella over my cam i film . big diff . so , this newer model really all much better ? can't wait know ! 3x optical sounds good ..	-1
i so love size shape this camera . this one takes some good pictures , appear quite clear . it better than integrated camera my cell phone . this camera may seem like it taken poor quality image , but when you transfer them onto pc , they seem so clear ! however it recommended you get memory card this camera it only 14mb internal memory . this camera gift me , i'd say it best birthday present i received	-1
multi-element add-on lense used kodak dx-7590 provides good wide-angle capability . note this very large add-on lense ( screws into dx-7590 extension-piece which costs additional $20 ) . job well most portraiture scenic applications , however two caveats :( 1 ) slight curvature field extreme corners wide-angle shots ( ie , corners shots may noticeably out focus ) . suggest cropping 95% original picture maintain sharpness across plane . ( 2 ) size lense render pop-up flash outside lense focusing system ( ultra-sonic ) less functional .	-1
this camera case fits camera perfectly extra battery must . price two items together same battery alone local electronics stores . so , i look it getting case free !	1
we use our batteries lot . no problems . works advertised .	-1
i don't think anybody going pretend little casio exilim ex-z600 6.0 mega pixel camera best camera ever built or takes best pictures world . but under $[ ... ] , it hard beat everything advertised . size perfect , one smallest , slimmest cameras made , easily fitting into one [ ... ] pocket , even when enclosed small case . viewing screen probably biggest brightest you'll find , so aiming shooting easy it . range modifications ( size , contrast , sharpness , saturation , etc . ) taking managing pictures seems almost endless , yet various menus camera offers simple navigate . camera docking stand makes downloading pictures one computer well charging up camera snap . moreover , according casio , single charge afford one up 500 or more snaps . picture quality ? it perhaps not absolutely clear well defined , even its maximum six mega pixels , best cameras ; although , fair , best cameras often cost three-to-four times much this one . so , far i'm concerned , i've no complaints , pictures i've taking delight eye . z600 makes picture-taking fun again	1
$14.00 , you should get this sleek little package protect your camera battery/accessories . if you've ever accidentally dropped expensive camera , you know just what i'm talking . it nice looking well	-1
camera arrived earlier than i expected , just what i wanted . very small , but versitle . large screen . very satified my purchase	1
celestron tool easy carry , easy use , ( least my case ! ) gives me quick , precision collimation my newtonian . why pay laser collimator ( which needs calibrated ) when you use this ? collimation most important part your setup ; without good mirror alignment , all you'll see blobs blurs even best viewing nights . this combination tool makes aligning both primary secondary mirrors fairly painless , also fairly fast . highly recommended any level observer	1
i'm pleased purchase . i bought this camera just under two years ago when i getting ready trip abroad . i spent six months england , five weeks travelling around europe this camera its case my belt . it very sturdy if nothing else , trains , planes , hostels , general bustle i'm very pleased how well it held up . nothing it broke . i probably took least 400 pictures during my trip , if not more . sure i've swap out batteries one or two occasions two years i've it , but my general feeling batteries holding up quite well . zoom this camera very nice . it one better zooms i've seen simple camera this type , or least it back when i bought it . it also several features older film cameras not , such timer you set before running get your own picture , or settings take " portraits " or " night shots . " i know this camera cannot compare professional cameras , i know it doesn't all frills new digital cameras , i am not trying compare it those . i'm not professional photographer , so i don't know how use camera exchangable lenses whatnot . i don't want digital personal professional reasons . traditional film camera , this one best i've ever used . bottom line : good quality photos , sturdy build , excellent zoom lens , useful easy use features , long battery life make this camera excellent choice if you want traditional film camera few perks	1
this spotting scope bushnell excellent buy if you outdoors person or if you like watching world your window . you even view craters moon . plus it waterproof comes two cases tripod . amazon price best deal internet	1
i'm not professional but this lens makes me feel like one . it very versatile lens , working well inside or out , low light or extremely bright . am looking forward taking sporting pictures next spring	1
after springing cybershot august so i could compact camera i would actually take places , i've very , very pleased . last camera i older sony dsc quite bulky , ran batteries , shutter problems -- but it took great quality pictures interface features perfect , so i thought i would go dsct5 , since it avoids all those problems . only tiny battery charge , no sticky shutter ... it sexy hell . screen huge very bright . i hate taking pictures flash general , i find flash makes nasty redeye more often than not this camera . ( camera gives you impression you cant change shutter speed or anything ) however ! you easily change this going into over/under exposure options under exposing your photos when you dark environments . they come out surprisingly well blur-free	1
casio exilim ex-s770rd great camera price . camera smallest market fit any pocket . lcd sreen large very clear . 7.2 mp produces great picture quality functions easily accessed . this my first casio purchase , i am very pleased quality	-1
great camera . . . one few lower priced cams keep mic jack headphone jack , but beware . .. . this camera not come lens cap , no remote control . other sources state this camera not leica lens . this camera not a/v input . no flash , no hot accessory shoe ( though it one which no power ) . no widescreen lcd . it record widescreen but no image stabilization widescreen .	1
i checked 3ccd panasonic canon camcorders . price range this best i found ( if you extra money , new hdv camcorder sony might your best bet ! ) . important : ccd issues referred other user comments real ( although i don't know if it also apply this new model ) . it actually happened my previous sony . i purchased 5 years warranty sony my dcr-hc90 . 5 years good product life so i take risk ccd failure after period enjoy this great product until then ! great features : small but feels solid , 3 megapixel pictures ( impressive quality camcorder ) , incredible low light performance , nice touch screen , great features . battery life actually not too bad original battery but you might need extra . what i not like : cannot take full size pictures camera mode ( only memory mode ) , limited zoom compared most new camcorders lots required extra ( svideo cable , ilink cable , video light , decent size memory stick , extended warranty ) . i am still giving this 5-stars overall .	1
optical x6 zoom canon a710 already better than cameras it range ( i.e. non slr ) . however , zoom takes picture up natural size ; tele converter lens really make difference . firstly , if there any negatives , they very minor ; lens adapter black - would nice silver match camera . erm , that it ! main quality canon lens , which they always well . clarity this lens very good , very little fuzziness edge . it also connects simply adapter seems fairly solid when connected . electronics features help overall control adding attachment . tele lens make difference just getting bit closer get what you want .	1
after reading reviews here [ ... ] this baby , i little cocerned its low-light indoor performance . let me first say my fears largely unfounded . yes , if you film very low light , it darken many colors . but we're talking 60 lux , which roughly equivalent light put off candles birthday cake . just keep lights when your kid blows out candles , viola ! seriously , i absolutely no problems it filming too dark indoors , outdoors , or even when i film local bands playing dark bars . reason i wanted try this camera because it only flash-based camera receiving even mildly positive reviews . i not want tape mechanism break , nor fragile hard drive cannot used many film-worthy conditions ( think snow skiing , drive mechanism freeze up you very cold weather ) . i said , i skeptical when i purchased it , but no more . videos far better than any other camcorder i've owned . my last canon zr 50 mini dv , this camera takes vastly superior videos than one . four stars only because mpeg2 format this records . i mac , so editting requires i convert dv streamclip so imovie import movies . mainly , i just don't edit my home videos so hasn't problem . but if would nice it easier option , it could if they encoded mpeg4 h264 mp3/aac , which appears next standard . if concerns you , or if you want hd , you might wait until panasonic sd1 available because it records avhdc which form mpeg4 . course , imovie doesn't yet support either , so you may wait until ilife 07 really use it . parting , i also mention size this unit absolutely fabulous . i no longer dread lugging around even my smallish mini dv camera . this thing literally fits my jacket pocket , so i end up filming lot more than i previous cameras . if you're looking small , flash-based , good quality video , get this camera , you'll love it	-1
i've waiting this technology years . so when i found out jvc planning coming out their 4 gb microdrive version , i one . $1500 price tag too much though . then i found out gz-mg50 coming out , would $1000 . i thought it still little pricey , but i couldn't wait any longer . so far , camera performed great . it easy use easy transfer files my computer then dvd . however , video editing software came it seems bit cheap , but it gets job . maybe next gen version improvemen t.t he movie quality very good . i won't give it " great " because i occasionally see pixel blurring when watching my burned dvds . don't bother taking pictures this , unless you only plan emailing them . quality far too low use capture those precious moments . i recommend getting additional battery ( three hour model ) . one hour battery just doesn't cut it , especially if you want review your scenes while you're out shooting . if jvc gave camcorder larger ccd included better software , i would given this 5 star rating , otherwise i think they right track , few years , minidv may forgotten eigh t-t rack .	-1
good camera $129 i paid . everything pretty well , your picture modes pretty customizable . only qualm it takes second or two longer than i wish when camera saves/loads pictures memory card . might problem when trying shoot consecutive pictures -- but probably wouldn't doing it this type camera anyways .	-1
after much research i finally found binoculars fit my every need . price right , delivery right schedule , product excellent	1
it great . nice top storage memory cards extra battery . compact . perfect camera size .	1
my husband i recently bought this bag take trip mexico . it perfect , fit our video camera , small digital camera , canon digital elph , 2 lenses all chargers accessories we needed trip . plus , tripod !! also my husband used it his carry bag which helpful given how tight airport security these days . i totally recommend this bag someone who travels several different pieces photographic equipment	1
this item perfect fit my rebel xt . well padded , lots compartments accommodate my accessories one location . awesome product protect my priced possession . highly recommended digital slr owners	1
sure , this isn't pro mono pod it doesn't mobile head but money it great . easily holds my olympus e1 50-200mm lens . great walking stick well . stores tight light . highly recommend this product . i may just get back up	-1
good quality , particularly amazing price . sturdy , well-made , even case nice . pops open second , collapses just easily . keep mind fully collapsed it wider than standard backpack , so if you lash it under backpack it awkward . but strap carrying case makes it easy loop monopod carry it vertically	1
this my second " " lens other 70-200l f4 both exceptional . if you looking professional results you need good equipment used within it limits .	1
i am thrilled this lens capabilities pictures it . i test shot corner window determine if it would good my insect shots i like so well . i bought this add-on converter am thrilled added this 50mm lens these necessary items my set-up . i like nature photography best like use my off summer days hiking finding photographs take perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles subjects what i like specialize . this lens greatly enhance your experience ' little world ' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away . i built diffuser using ping-pong ball over flash so lighting would work better . ( works great , btw ) . usual , it great canon glass trick .	1
i picked up 5d march 28-135 . worked 3 months felt something missing . i went bit bullet , got 24-105 what amazing difference it made . color = vivid , clarity = sharp , good walk-around lens . after 4 months , i not one bad thing say this lens . my suggestion , if you looking lens , would this one	1
i own several canon lens my 20d this hands down best . i 28-135 which very good lens regardless some reviews , i got many excellent photos it - this distinctly better all ways . ( course , it costs lot more ) . recently went grandchildred sea world i got 100% good photos , several really outstanding ones . it light , accurate - what more you want ? you replace slew lens this one perhaps selling old ones help pay it . bought it soon it available not regretted it one moment . if you one lens , this one	1
despite reading glowing reviews this lens , i still surprised see how well it performed . lens so sharp you get very good cropped pictures running athletes , distance three quarters football field away , shooting hand held , late afternoon light , which print 5x7 still look like pro took them ! if you want tack sharp lens indoor sports pictures can't afford , or otherwise not want long lens outdoor sports pictures , then you should give this lens your serious consideration .	1
if you don't want get hooked canon series lens , not buy this one . i made mistake buying one now all i want canon lens . it super sharp , contrast saturation fantastic . no need retouch any your photos . so far , i've used it candid shots my kids dance gigs . f/ 2.0 helps lot get right shutter speed freeze action . very good buy . i got mine here amazon	1
all reviews this lens all true . it great lens . i love quality it . however , if you like take door photoes don't very big rooms , you might want consider 50mm f/ 1.4 . i mostly find my self backed up corner trying take picture home	-1
answer most likely yes ; since its price make it best value fast canon prime lens . but before you make $350 plunge here few useful things know how it used . keep mind i use this lens rebel xt ( 1.6 factor ) , which means it provides me angel view similar 135mm film cameras . sharpness : yes that one feature you count when buying this lens . this lens produces very sharp pictures . so much so it blow away your 18-55 kit lens ( if you one ) all other zoom lenses . exception l-series zooms . sharpness difference obvious even smallest prints ( 4 6 ) . if you can't envision such difference then consider this . sharpness viewed contrast edges different color objects . hence , sharper image greater contrast edges such groups color . this lens captures contrast such setting better than most other lenses . speed : this lens blazingly fast . such you opportunity shoot higher shutter speeds wide open ( remember inverse relation aperture shutter speed ) . more importantly you gain ability shoot low light situations ( concert example ) still maintain decent shutter speed handholding . here best part , if you're like most new people photography , you probably plan take self portraits . this lens give you ability , you able buy few clamp lights coupled 100-150w bulbs start shooting medium iso speeds wide open . angel view : assuming you using this lens 1.6 digital format consider you tight crop , more like 135mm lens film camera ( 1.6 *85 = 136 ) . what translate practical terms ? you stand 6-8 feet away your subject able cover their head shoulders landscape orientation . special effects : here two special effects you find useful this lens depth field compression . some degree or every lens offers depth field , which summarize only subject interest focus rest picture blurred . this lens unique it creates very shallow depth field which subject truly isolated whole scene . set aperture 1.8 focus correctly you achieve such results . more importantly lens quality such blur ( known bokeh ) outstanding there eight diaphragm blades control aperture opening vs . 5 or 6 many other lenses . compression , since camera telephoto it compress everything its sight closer together fit its sight . example , if you photographing person , their face look wider their nose look smaller or flatter . keep mind unlike some longer telephoto lenses ( 300mm example ) effect this lens subtle pleasant size build : its size weight perfect ! it balances my xt very nicely . so much so , i take pictures very low shutter speeds this combination ( though i don't find my self doing often this fast lens ) . all this translates comfort confidence when i am shooting this lens . build quality excellent , i find no inherit weakness design . if you plan photograph friends family then this lens . you take sharp pictures right kind effects portraits like compression beautiful bokeh . lens fast designed excellently maximum control comfort . you won't miss shot because shake slow shutter speeds even if you ( that big if ) you put its speed use dialing higher aperture . it only draw back it pretty tight angel view 1.6 factor slrs . i can't think any other prime non-l canon line up matches this lens ( other than possibly 50mm 1.4 ) . truly incredible value , buy it confidence ! ps . no means this review cover all merits this lens . name couple , lens offers precise auto focus low chromatic aberration . rather , i covered features most useful its intended purpose ; taking pictures people .	1
i bought this keep dust iraq out my canon ef-s 17-85 lens . it fine job i've seen no noticeable change quality images i'm capturing my canon 20d	1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid conical three three quarters inch long offers some protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . there nothing more irritating than reviewing your images find dust spots or other flaws . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 100-400mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 ef lens normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one lens amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . fortunately canon provides storage case lens used addition your camera bag . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image qualityoffers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store len	-1
since there tons rave reviews features this camera , i won't bother you details . instead , i tell you one huge letdown this camera likes ( rebel , 20d ): 1.6 focal length factor . this means my dear 28-105 lens now sorry 45-170 . recoup loss i'd spend $700 17-40 4.0 lens . this consequence using small ccd . cameras like 1d full-size 35mm ccd sell over $ 4,000 . i cannot wait price go down . i also cannot help wonder whether focal reading speedlite flashes correct ( i own 540ez discovered dismay it doesn't work these cameras ) . i look my a2 ( still infatuated it ) i wonder if i right thing . i think i keep it around while , just case ..	-1
i've my remote switch almost 3 months now . i love it . so far only feature i used remote switch it works flawlessly . if you want trip shutter distance without shaking 20d ( camera i use ) this what you need . i use it extension cord since i am generally 30 feet away camera . i am very pleased this purchase . no complaints this point	1
ability combine four different delay interval modes makes this product able accommodate almost any automatic-shooting situation . you control delay until sequence starts , delay shots , total shooting time , number shots . last one , however , where glaring flaw comes : controller limited 99 shots when you use total-number-of-shots setting . correspondence i've canon , they no explanation this asinine limitation . even modest cf card these days holds more than 99 shots , even raw mode . time lapse , 99 shots woefully inadequate . you work around this defect simply letting your card fill up or doing math using total-duration setting . but sometimes you want shoot multiple sequences one card . if you know you want 300 frames ( example ) , it annoying baby-sit camera stop it manually , or math figure out how many seconds total your sequence take , convert minutes seconds , then dial into setting controller . if you then decide use different interval , you get re-do all . dumb , canon . fact , this device shouldn't necessary anyway . every camera today should come this functionality ; it technically trivial , since every one these digital slrs computer plenty on-board timers logic this task	-1
i never take my uv filter off my lens unless i am going immediately put different filter . there basically two camps out there , those feel you should always use uv filter protect your lens dirt scratches those feel it waste time only degrades your image . well , i tried going without one awhile then dirt started build up front element my very expense lens . although you clean front element lens , i feel much , much safer wiping my comparatively cheap uv filter time time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage . i think nearly unquantifiable loss image quality you may suffer uv filter , it well worth extra piece mind it gives me	-1
i hesitated year upgrade 550 580 because , paper , i not see much advantage . fact , 580 worthwhile upgrade . i like new dial back adjusting exposure compensation , etc . catchlight screen nice touch but biggest advantages incredibly fast recycling time smailler size . i machine gun my 1ds2 this flash keeps up . 550 could not . it small enough not overwhelm my little rebel too . i note there some vignetting 24mm direct flash unless i drop wide lens screen . manual says ths not happen but it . not big deal since i use gary fong diffuser or bounce flash almost always	1
good basic set inexpensive filters . nice case . great beginner/starting set . if you're willing spend more money filters , getting b+w or hoya suit you better .	-1
i found tiffen filters offer unlimited possibilites . this kit you get three great filters . most important circular polarizer . if you shooting outdoors it must . you also get 812 warming filter which i found bring great depths warmth photographs . filters protect lenses tiffen i found great quality this great value	-1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
i am not most experienced photographer , but this camera takes terrific pictures , my opinion . nice big lcd screen touch screen great feature	1
camera superb , light-weight wonder . controls logical large display area amazing . i love it .	1
you'll never regret buying canon series . fit finish perfect image quality excellent	1

when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i'd always loyal film . digital could never take place film . i'm not convinced it replaced film completely . there still something i love putting roll film camera , shooting away , sending film processed , seeing results . i also know it bit expensive . i know argument quality always paramount discussion , but digital cameras improving this regard , most manufacturers assuring users while technology always improving , we point where good investment made digital slr it not outdated soon buyer purchases camera . so i figured now time get digital slr . i loyal nikon user nearly ten years , owned nikon n60 , n70 , n80 . my first love , still n70 ( i've told person who sold me camera he thought i only person who loved n70 ) . i purchased n80 only after my n70 cost too much repair , but i've enjoyed way my various nikon cameras handled all sorts situations fact they simple use point shoot if i don't time use specific controls , but it also options more creative artistic purposes . my nikon cameras allowed me capture family moments ease majestic landscapes , wildlife shots all sorts other things i can't resist capture forever . i decided purchase d70 since it close what i've already experienced nikon . many ways it works similar way n70 80 , except it digital rather than film version . like film versions midrange nikon slr , it dial allows automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , night portrait modes , ability select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . camera auto manual focus abilities . photos easy or technical photographer desires . controls easy use , though it takes practice comfortable . personal level , camera passed halloween test , niece birthday test , fall foliage new england test favorite scenic spots test . only real difficulty i've camera trying capture stained glass windows dark setting . auto focus not worked all i'm not thrilled manual focus these shots , but this point i'm sure it photographer not camera . i one suggestion anyone who purchases this camera . manual very confusing . it uses all sorts symbols more distraction than anything else . i've luck " magic lantern guides " my other cameras , but not yet used it this camera . i purchase nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which helpful . it quick reference anyone already familiar nikon photography general but it also provides introduction novice photography .	1
d70s minor update original d70 introduced 2004 , few new features slightly larger lcd . it still great camera , but expect it replaced new d80 , which 40 percent more pixels , 2.5 -inch lcd , additional useful features old price d70s . so , you probably save little money still purchase sophisticated digital slr if you wait until prices d70s stabilize new , lower level . , say , $600 , this camera would incredible bargain . d70s shined one best cameras its class since its introduction . example , it 1/500th second flash synch speed ( found no other camera but d50 ) so you keep ambient light under control avoid ghost images . its autofocus fast accurate , features both single-autofocus , continuous-autofocus ( tracking action ) , novel " automatic " autofocus mode switches af-s af-c required . if you no nikon lenses , get this camera 18-70mm kit lens , which very sharp versatile , rather than more limited 18-55 lens . you won't regret it	1
i owned this camera two months now taken 100 photographs ( keepers ) date . because i involved photography almost 35 years , i developed certain prejudices . particular , i never comfortable auto exposure even less comfortable auto focus . fact , last auto focus camera i owned nikon n8008s i ultimately sold auction because i could not adapt using various auto settings . however , i like this camera . why ? d70s very easy camera use i only refer manual check couple settings look up some features . honestly , set up takes only few minutes handling not terribly different film camera . i should point out this camera really designed auto focus lenses if you choose use your manual focus lot , you disable many camera features . because i am both stubborn cheap ( but mostly only when it comes spending money myself ) i am using my manual focus lenses this camera . it true i not get any internal exposure meter readings must rely handheld gossen or sunny 16 rule ( quite effective , really ) exposure determination . lcd preview screen thus critical determining or adjusting exposure . i should also point out depth field preview feature also lost when using manual focus lenses . i stunned when i could not stop my lens down burrowed through manual find out what i doing wrong -- which nothing except i using wrong type lens . while i really miss this feature , i am not sure how big loss it really because viewfinder . others made mention low magnification tunnel like views through finder i attest this fact . i compared finder views my trusty old fm just stunned how poorly d70 compared . ultimately best camera camera you use d70 become my camera choice . even though i am using this camera like vintage series leica -- i.e. , handheld meter presetting exposure anticipation photograph -- i find i live this level usability . some point i probably buy auto focus lens ( maybe 35 f2 ) make full use feature set . but now i content using camera old fashioned way	-1
i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	-1
i am severe novice photography not know much subject but i really wanted take better pictures my boyfreind who freetstyle motocross . i hard time getting timing down getting good zoom my old camera this camera i getting some amazing pictures . first when reading manual i became extremely overwhelmed scared i made bad decision . i still not know what fancy functions how use them . but i find it very user friendly if you just go automatic shooting modes . i'm very excited wonderful picture quality i've getting . some his sponsors even using my shots their advertisements ! i highly recommend this camera !!	1
i bought remote control so i could trip shutter while my camera tripod . mostly landscape stuff . it works great my intended use . only minor problem you point remote control front camera . i found it works fine if i hold remote front , below lens ( out view lens )	-1
i am just hobbyist . this big purchase big step me get into this level camera . i still haven't mastered using it yet , i've it few months . it wonderful job taking pictures . if you right lenses , it take some most beautiful pictures you've ever seen . again , i'm just hobbyist/enthusiast . i use it take pictures work , too . i highly recommend getting couple very good lenses go it . don't go cheap lenses canon , tamron , sigma , etc . make this camera . yourself favor get nice zoom - spend some bucks . you'll happy you . camera itself pretty easy use if you leave it auto , but that like buying race car never shifting out first gear . auto settings great , they wonderful job , but you so much more if you learn use camera manual , av , tv , or mode . it allows you so much more creativity you'll amazed difference . 30d came out right before i bought 20d , i would probably buy it price now , but i'm very happy my 20d	1
i bought this camera 2 months before my son born . i knew little digital slrs , but after research i found this one me . this camera well constructed durable . pictures excellent . i blown few my pictures up 11x17 without any problem . also , if you going doing any editing photos your computer , this camera would great . i would recommend purchasing newest version photoshop or photoshop elements ( when i bought mine it only came elements 2.0 3.0 already market ) . also , if you want your pictures turn out , you must purchase larger flash . onboard flash weak , leave shadows it not allow you any type " bounce " flash . whole , this best camera i ever my life it would great anyone who previous experience slr cameras .	1
this really handy lens your bag . i added this lens my collection several months ago , i haven't regretted it one bit . i took trip montana august used this lens photograph ton wildflowers . i also using 70-300mm telephoto lens 24-70mm wide angle lens heavily , but most my favorite shots trip taken this lens . autofocusing very quiet since it usm powered , but it often tricky get right focus if you're doing extreme closeup . this general facet macro lenses , so you'll probably find yourself using manual focus 90% time or more . manual focus this lens quite excellent though , responds well fine adjustments . it also quite easy me handhold it , long i decent amount light or pop up flash . all said , this nice lens grab after you decent telephoto lens , if you like photographing small things . otherwise , you might look into getting some other lenses first , i.e. wide angle , fisheye , etc . ( unless you already own all them :-))	1
i wanted get macro lens everyone told me this one get ... i'm so glad i . smaller sensor my 30d , 100mm more like 150mm or so , so it nice , wide-open telephoto/portrait lens well . i've uploaded few photos i've taken w/ this lens show what it capable macro telephoto . i thought 17mm-85mm usm lens came e/ my camera sharp - but compared this lens , kit lens might well diy pinhole camera . my less than perfect rating there no image stabilization available macro lenses . when i'm trying hone bees pollenating flower , there lot shake . i can't practically use tripod when insects bouncing bud bud , so i take 100 shots get one that not shake blur - i miss some really cool shots . addition lack image stabilization , i am frustrated w/ sometimes unpredictable focusing happen lens trying decide whether it should focusing telephoto or macro . i wish there switch lens make it macro only or telephoto only , so it wouldn't bouncing one focal length other all time . i've taken far more successful telephoto shots than macro . telephoto focal length bit long ( those us who cannot afford full-frame sensor camera ) most casual photography . i recently used this lens shoot some promo shots some massage therapists small eatery . i practically set up restaurant bathroom get photos i wanted , but opted this lens because it much faster ( 2.8 ) i wanted use natural light over flash . lens long heavy its range . addition battery pack grip , this lens added very weighty , so i may not take it w/ me my kit bag every shoot . once i add short fixed focal length lens moderate telephoto my kit , my guess this lens pulled out only special occasions . it tack-sharp , but it frustrating times	-1
this my first lens . amateur , this really makes you see difference lenses . i use this general lens basically put away lens came kit . i am also planning purchase 100-400mm better wildlife family sports photography . wish it came better lens hood .	1
this lens produces magical images . i am stunned its sharpness , contrast color saturation . simply amazing ! this great option standard zoom aps-c cameras great wide-angle option full-frame . aps-c ussers , i sold my ef-s 17-85 usm because this just miles better . i simply love this lens ! i am now so sold difference makes , i also sold my telephoto lens 70-200 f4 l.i believe this great investment because : * canon lenses lose very little their value * should canon abandon aps-c sized sensor full-frame 35mm , then ef lens range make your kit far more future-proof * once initial sting price receded , you never regret quality images you take this lensjust try it - it awesome ! some reviewers call this slow lens - i would disagree . many zooms 3.5 - 5.6 , or perhaps 3.5 - 4.5 pro-sumer range . there virtually nothing 3.5 f4 , constant f-stop advantage . f4 not fast , but it certainly not slow , either	1
this magnificent lens deserving high praise . general , i tend shoot " available light " towards wide angle , ef 17-40 f4l one perfect lens someone like me . aps size sensor camera ( mine rebel xt ) , it works approximately like 28-70 mm zoom -- perfect walk-around lens , giving you decent wide angle tele end , pleasing perspective faces you expect moderate telephoto . i spent two weeks ef 17-40 coast shooting nature street stuff small towns . it performed perfectly . but i only realized what real treasure i when i began second thoughts it eve long overseas journey . i asked myself whether i would not better buying ef-s 17-85 f4- 5.6 . after all , it gives you better reach - equivalent 28-135 mm zoom 35 mm camera . would it not perfect lens overseas trip ? dilemma worhty hamlet . so i decided order it amazon while i still time return ef 17-40 . soon ef-s 17-85 came , i some tests taking pictures still life , flowers portrait similar focal lengths full zoom . results put 17-85 shame . color light flat paled next 17-40 . but there still problem reach . i took portrait full zoom same person ( 40 mm or 65 mm equivalent 85 mm or 135 equivalent ) , cut out critical focus area both pix equalized two crops terms pixel numbers . unprocessed , 17-85 produced perfectly focused picture , 17-40 crop visibly softer , but terms tonality richness gradations , it way ahead its rival . photoshop rescue ! after i fiddled sharpening contrast cs2 , focus softness 17-40 gone , result better all-around picture same portrait detail . other words , if you wish take picture , say , building detail or monkey mug shot zoo -- situation calling telephoto 135 mm 17-85 capable -- ef 17-40 f4 job , fact better job terms textures tonality -- focus , too , if you little post-processing sc2 . i am returning ef-s 17-85 stick ef 17-40 , taking it my overseas trip . unlike ef-s 17-85 f4- 5.6 , which feels like decent consumer zoom , ef 17-40 f4l built like tank weather sealing . it should also come handy if when i decide switch full-frame camera ( ef-s lenses work only aps-size sensors ) .	1
there nothing like telephoto bring boats anchor up close when you're halfway up mountain . i got great shot tahiti just way just this lense friend mine used it cover her romance novel . it true lense heavy . canon says it weighs 1.7 pounds , but it seems heavier . no matter though , because you won't go gym if you heft this baby around awhile , side benifit , you'll get crisper , sharper photos then you would any other 200mm out there today . just think it body building photo shooting both same time . also this one won't break your wallet . serously , this one darned fine piece glass , you just simply cannot go wrong canon " " lense , just can'tjack priest , sailor home se	1
filters i got poorly finished . 812 filter smudge it , while all 3 filters don't screw properly my lens . all filters come off easily . they totally useless . i suggest you buy filters real store so you try them your lens	-1
this bag easily accomodates my new canon s3 , lens adapter hood , room spare . recently , during trip europe , i also able fit several other items into bag : rechargeable battery charger , ac adapter , outlet adapter , two sets rechargeable batteries , well uv filter , i still room more . i've no doubt wide- tele-converters this camera would also fit , room spare	1
i've many camera bags over years , this one seems fit bill best . it roomy - carries camera body one lens , plus charger , extra batteries , manual , memory card , room lens or two . i wouldn't say it would able hold more than three lenses . we recently took this trip st. lucia it held up well , even repelling some unexpected rain . we very pleased . size perfect - roomy but not overly bulky . i'd highly recommend this bag !	1
it bit heavy but superb lens . interior construction quite bit plastic however which bit concern . i've dropped one onto hard packed dirt/soccer field w/no damage ... so it pretty sturdy :) if you live 1 stop less light consider newly released 70-200 f/4 . this new 70-200 f/4 canon save you some weight if concern	1
i use this gem my 20d my 24-105mm , far i'm concerned it one best optical lenses out there . my 24-105 isn't ideal indoor/low light lens nor it ideal sports photography lens ( although it sharp , just not quite long enough ) 70-200 fills gap my arsenal boot ! photos i've taken so far sidelines all keepers . if you afford it , it , you won't regret i	1
this lens great those indoor regular nothing fancy shots . i recently used mine indoors restaurant distance or close up range perfect .	1
let honest ... " kit lens " adds approximately $70 overall price camera body not supposed canon l-series quality . sure , you find better quality lens , but not $70 you can't!i plan use this lens knock around lens allows me get more familiar my camera run off some shots . personally ( this personal preference ) , i find i tend want closer subjects anyway - 1.6 factor rebel xt , i'm great shape some my other lenses . if you don't happen already super wide lens your arsenal , you getting digital eos 1.6 magnification factor , then buy this lens . please don't let some other " lens snobs " sway you - few which actually " posers " snap less than 500 pix per year spend more time looking technical aspects picture instead its true artistic value . i hear them now .. " it isn't contrasty enough " , " barrel distortion horrible wide end " , " pin cushion significant " ... i say bah !! these statements true ... sure they ... degree . but let remember not everyone afford picky . buy lens , load camera fresh battery blank memory card get out there !! if you find yourself shooting wide end often , then sell/give this lens colleague go search ( higher quality ) lens ... very little lost . enjoy yourselves take lots pictures ... good luck	1
this lens must all beginner photographers . excellent sharpness really fast lens . i know i've heard many complain cheap feel it but less than $100 you can't beat it . yes it plastic mount , yes focus ring small but quality it pictures price make it definite winner until you decide move up much higher priced l .	-1
this good prime lens , although not perfect rebel xt . sharp throughout most range , good low-light shots . overall , solid buy	-1
i compared number pro-sumer cameras became firmly convinced this best camera money . although nikon one time considered premier camera professional , they now take second stage canon not only engineering , but quality lens , innovative user-friendly design , overall quality . i used camera approximately one month delighted . talken pictures over 35 years - including professional - always using minolta equipment all those years , i am truly enamored this canon camera	1
this very easy use camera . simply using auto mode composing your pictures properly you get very good jpeg images . it also complicated you want make it . it many advanced features it . i shooting 35mm 32 years . my most recent before this one elan ii 7 years ago . it still working also . 30d my first digital i absolutely love camera . i generally work aperture priority mode tripod 100 iso when shooting landscape . but , camera very capable auto mode well without tripod . i like shoot raw so i tweek things bit , but jpeg images very acceptable . it also works extremely well portraits . it actually better than 35mm me because it very low noise even higher isos . 1600 looks like 800 film me . this very good value money my opinion	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	-1
i bought this battery canon 30d take around thousand pic one charge . very happy battery performance	1
okay , lot said saving money , however there problems no-name or non-branded products . no matter what your " style " photography , you battery empty its charge critical moment . back-up essential . quality back-up battery get you through imperative . knock-off brands not hold same charge branded battery meant your camera ; although their manufacture may claim it . get zone get shot !	1
i started looking earlier version this flash when i saw upgrades 430ex i didn't hesitate order it . it what i've needed take my photos higher level . i shoot two magazines now instead taking my studio light into every shoot , i still carry it me , i use this flash instead it makes world difference	1
this very nice flash unit integrates well powershot pro1 camera . i appreciate zooming strobe tube match lens focal length well ability bounce flash off ceiling softer effects . i should purchased this flash when i first got pro1 camera	1
this great unit . works great purpose which it made . i'm going eventually get 580 so i use it slave unit ( wireless option ) wraparound lighting system . i would recommend diffuser so light subdued especially when you wish brighten fleshtones people photo golden light so they presented their best image . blue spectrum light not present us best way	1
this great lens joy use .... keep mind min 1:6 sensors 160mm so you limited respect . would nice if you could see lens settings like focus range preset view finder . don't like fact lens hood not mark show where it installed quickly .. not bad using logo indicator normal use , but always problems putting it back reversed put away . other hoods small dot etc help line it up . this lens grip double batteries get your attention after days shooting it . good news ... when you take it off you feel you pocket camera weight . i posted some action/panning shots this lens there didn't seem any others . couple aircraft couple auto racin	1
if you use this lens 1.6 camera body such xt , 20d , or 30d you end up 160-640mm equivalent which impressive range any standard . you also add 1.4 tc 896mm upper limit or 2x tc amazing 1280mm . course this comes price , i'm not just talking money . you use tripod , cable release , mirror lockup lot time when using such long focal lengths . plus this thing very heavy very large people take notice . so if stealth photography your goal , go something like 70-300 . said , this amazing lens , admittedly little slow near long end , but get down f/4 would most likely doubled or tripled price weight , so it seems like acceptable trade-off . if you want sharp pictures , amazing zoom range , good workout , but don't mind center attention , this lens you	1
this lens super-sharp , colors come out vibrant , it two modes , push/pull ( some people don't like , but your zooms super-fast ) . this probably best canon telephoto lens terms focal range . one bit warning ; it not only fairly large made metal ( not plastic ) , but it kind heavy -- while it doesn't weigh 50 pounds , aware it not light . carrying it around when attached camera , you carry equipment lens , not body	1
i bought this lense recently . first i thought it heavy , but once i got used it , i decided it heavy due quality . it big lense , tripod mount very useful , especially balance . you can't but notice quality this lense . function very useful . combine this lense 2x extender , you've effectively got 800mm lense . anyone looking zoom lense , this one seriously consider . sport , function brilliant , wildlife ... well , i go how good this lense . bottom line - well worth buying	1
this thing perfect carrying your stuff around not-so-fattening way . i hvae external flash , macro kit , 28-80 lens , 50mm lens , 18-55mm lens , dslr w/batt grip 75-300mm lens attached all fit into main body this thing . everything seperated dividers making me feel confident safe while walking , hiking , biking , etc . addon pouches seem make it bit more bulking you'd want , but bag all itself fantastic i can't recommend it enough - get away huge bulky shoulder bags !! lowepro it again	1
great filter price-no reason spend more . filter threads high quality , it possible stack filters if you want-not recommended , though , if you using it wide-angle , i am . no vignetting , sturdy filter .	1
i agree all positive reviews this lens . it great lens , give certain silky smooth bokeh 24-105 lacks gives nice bright viewfinder . it couple quirks though--it very heavy so prepared . lens this quality high speed need lot glass there . -when you zoom out wide , it actually gets longer which bit strange . sometimes when you taking group picture you need zoom out bit fit everyone shot , subjects see lens moving towards them think you going closeup . this partially remedied using included hood which masks lens bit always extended .	-1
i think it very well could so i'm not going differ those who say it . i bought this use new 5d itt simply outstanding every regard . so far , i've kept it 5d can't bring myself take it off . i considered couple lenses , including 24-105 f/4 which lot appeal price same . but this lens i chose part because i already 70-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 lens overlap seemed waste while extra stop helps . i no regrets it . sharp tack quick . i note this not compact lens , especially hood it stretch out lot when you widen field . it also not light . this lens 5d give your neck back pain , assuming you work more than one camera . but focal lengths covered just ideal require none compromises longer zoom range require . , i've got 18-200 20d . 70-300 , while not , specs out range virtue real compactness , but it ' not lightweight . these two lenses cover just everything me . i keep 10-22mm 20d extra-wide shots . since writing initial review , i've since traveled several weeks this lens it fully lived up expectations . given difficulties travel these days , i am concerned problem not able carry it me -- not problem date except britain . but always possible . , despite weight , i might favor 70-200 f/ 2.8 usm second travel lens- i like brightness focus . one suggestion . there temptation use this lens wide open lot time . it very good sometimes that best thing . but i've also found this lens makes beautiful images stopped down good deal short night time exposures tripod remote release . effect lights , etc . considerably different extended depth field .	1
i bought this lens replace ef 100-300mm ( usm ) we my wife film shooting days ( not common lens , apparently ; 75-300mm seems more widespread ) . older lens produced some surprisingly good pictures ( quite sharp ) , but handheld shots hard get right long focal lengths . image stabilization feature this lens works remarkably well , but it quite bit noisier than ef-s 17-85mm ( my first lens ; you hardly hear gyrations all one ) . sharpness quite good ( probably tad better than ef 100-300mm , although it not foremost strength this lens my opinion ) . i surprised how much faster i acquire focus this lens , even though reviews suggested it still falls short l-series lenses ( see e.g. " flying gull " shot i uploaded " customer images " set ) . if you want shoot hand-held 150mm+ , i don't think this lens much competition under $1000 canon eos users	1
this good zoo lens . it not heavy or noticeable something like 100-400 lens . also , 3 stop smaller size weight this makes great backup lens 100-400 trips or when i just don't feel like carrying around 3+ pound lens all day . so if you don't want deal cost or size series lens this one next best options	-1
i used 1.4 ii extender over year . it gives me amazing detail my 70-200l f/4 lens 20d . i use it mostly wildlife butterflies . contrast good colors pop . when shooting sunny day shutter speeds still quick f/ 5.6 background blurred beautifully . shade areas low light tripod must ! there hasn't any sacrifice subject detail . i see individual hairs butterfly bodies even when shooting wide open . this great way get closer without paying significant amount supertelephoto lens	-1
excellent camera high end capabilities . easy use intuitive system controls	1
impressive feature list wih affordable price , serious ameteur . i've using 20d 18-55 , 50mm 1.8 , 35-80 , 80-200 500/1000mm lenses . i am not disappointed . i am planning upgrade series lenses but slowly . i not mean over entusiastic canon , but i am yet see nikon camera same specs same or ever near equal price . i've got fm10 film photography . i love both my cameras . impressive features include : mirror lockupiso 3200 noise reduction18 custom functionsaccepts entire series canon lens . heavy metal body ( no cheap plastic feel	1
i gone old 640x480 nine years ago 3.1 last few years canon 20d now , what pleasure shot . battery life not issue even over 250 shots , which should sufficient most anybody . there small learning curve but you would expect this any new camera . lens choice great idea which came earlier review excellent walk around ability this lens general shots closeups those favorite flowers . those individuals who fence this product i tout it all i spoken . it turned good photo experience our west coast road trip into real serious photo shoot , it also uses commonly accessable compact flash . built flash works well not explore options this time . delivery this item when promised nice bow package	1
typically fine original design canon . i " chinese " copy - it really - it works but it not same mfr own .	1
this lens pouch very durable good quality . it compacts down not unneccesary bulk . might seem alittle pricey but worth it long haul .	1
i got this lens cap when i ordered close-up lens my camera , powershot s1 , because it recommended something people who ordered part would also order . i , therefore , assumed it went same camera , or lens/adapter i ordering . however , it not appear fit either camera itself or any attachments , so i now wish i some more research determine whether it would actually fit my equipment	-1
first , canon 1ds mark ii awesome professional camera . this review completely misleading amazon offer 42% off . this biggest joke imaginable . amazon website shows list price $ 11,999 . 99 . when canon launched this camera msrp wasn't high . it $ 7,999 . methinks someone calculator got carried away . anyway , after adding it my cart see unbelievable low price it turns out its within $100 what every other reputable online shop selling it . i expected more amazon . this behavior reprehensible	1
i shooting digital four years now mostly kodak dcs cameras(660 through dcspro ) . life long nikon guy it big decision make switch canon 1ds mk2 . this camera light years ahead any kodak digital slr . i use this camera studio product , models , location , low light , you name it . canon never produced anything but astounding images me . all image parameters including sharpness far superior any old images i my kodak days . yes it pricey but if you working this camera you pay easily long before it useful days over .	1
this item good companion use battery backup ; i recommend this item all people using digital rebel xt . this battery long life after full charge , very light small piece you accommodate into any pocket or bag , i'm very satisfied this purchase	1
haven't used it yet ( bought it trip next month ) , but it arrived promised exactly described .	1
sd110 not good digital camera . better yet find something else . i've this camera almost year but i just seldom use it because result pictures very disappointing . it just fine downloading them internet but when you it printed paper , pictures get blurred . now , im looking digicam won't disappoint me	-1
strong rigid , easy control head so you it loose free movement but tight enough camera doesn't flop over . opens closes very easily . it kind expensive $50 but its probably worth money	-1
this monopod exactly what i expected good price . it extends very smoothly , stops hold leg firmly height i set . easy set up adjust one hand so i change height camera attached	1
i few ' ' lens , this far my favorite . reviews saying this their favorite lens not kidding . there plenty other reviews going over all features , but i would like add non-is . i purchased non-is version because i not want fork over extra million-dollars . if i knew i like this lens so much it would become my favorite lens , i would splurged . somewhere great-big-internet i read comparison two versions . version clearly shows less sharpness , but it not clear if only when . i'm not sure if it would noticeable digital	1
this hood comes 70-200 lens my local shop didn't stock it . they said it special order part it would take week it come . i ordered it friday , received it wednesday . not bad . thanks amazon	-1
this camera cord shoe works well . however , it break relatively easily so i suggest two any given time . also , cord length too short times two long depending your needs	1
looked this lens both camera shop line finally decided after much comparison other lenses finally purchase it , have'nt regretted it one bit . this lens clear excellent color , saturation sharpness without any or minimal post processing . coupled external flash it great indoors well . using it my everyday walk around lens . zoom range excellent(rebel xt/xti 1.6 magnification ) . though it somewhat big side , it won't tire you out carrying it around your neck . purchased hood seperately which , money should came lens . anyway , this lens offers excellent value money you won't regret investment	1
i always used third party lenses before but after trying this canon i say i am impressed quality , it feels like solid piece equipment rather than hunk lightweight plastic . i find my photos much sharper due lens itself . i tremors my hands so difficult time normal lens but helped tremendously . i like range zoom it pretty much all purpose me ( used kit lens only once since i got this lens when i needed wider angle ) . i could occasionally/rarely use little more distance but nothing perfect . my only complaint lens heavy pretty much doubles weight my camera ( rebel xt ) . you know it around your neck after few hours shooting . i haven't any focus hunting problems , which i constantly 3rd party lenses . lens very quiet which imo good thing . reasonably priced lens it well worth money	-1
all reviews i read , i expected certain pros cons this lens . i not disappointed . pros : very sharp lens very good colorscons : vignetting wide open , little too contrastyfor myself , pros outweighed cons price . it ideal 1.6 multiplier cameras , where it becomes 38mm lens	-1
i bought this grip year ago after shooting homecoming weekend my school , central michigan university . pain it saved my wrist able shoot sports vertically without hang my hand over top my camera huge relief . recently though , after year solid use , i've problems it . there days my camera suddenly say my batteries dry - after charging them day before . i've checked , my grip not part series recalled similar problem . i actually removed grip , batteries , restart camera correct problem . -- this big problem middle sports match -- however , grip great addition 20d/30d models . it not same feel using 1d , but it close you're going get . $150 , you can't go wrong vertical shooting doubled battery life . it also simply evens out weight camera , especially heavier l-glass lenses your camera	-1
i appreciate difference balance battery grip provides long lenses . e-1 hand strap attached this addition provides very solid , secure grip . also , bge2 comes carrier 6 aa cell batteries those instant dead battery emergencies	1
although people problems first generation this grip , i've completely satisfied mine . recently , i've shooting 300 2.8 , it would much more difficult without extra length grip ads body . similarly , second set buttons vertical shooting makes big difference , too . ( one note : when shooting vertical , it hard actuate thumb wheel impossible use joy stick -- which i frequently change focus points -- without moving my right hand . ) holding two batteries , grip also keeps me worrying running out juice during high volume shooting sessions . grip still little flex it , but i've never any power problems i've read here elsewhere	-1
i'm recreational photographer , i love this camera . this my 7th month beast -- since i pre-ordered it early amazon mistake . ( long story)before buying 1d mii , you should know few things : 1 . it easy overlook spec camera usb connection 1.1 not 2.0 . this 40 times slower , canon clearly intended mark ii connected via firewire . said , i occasionally use it my laptop road , which only usb connection . it convenient port there , but my 1gb cf card takes good half hour empty . 2 . time you've attached solid series or comparable lens this camera , it weighs enough lugging it around your shoulder , even without camera bag full tricks , quite burden . also , i talking professional photographer who wouldn't buy model just because cameras this heavy give her wrist trouble . if you've never held camera this size your hand , i recommend borrowing one first or checking our your local camera store , even if you ultimately buy amazon . 3 . camera conveniently supports both sd cf cards . unfortunately there no way copy two cards using camera . it not gigantic deal , but there times i wait get home trip free up sd card when i didn't camera cable , but just external cf reader . those really only 3 things i wish i'd known before i bought camera ... but would they affected my purchase ? probably not ! i said , i bought camera mistake . it loads fun ? definitely . i prints almost good medium format - 100 times convenience .	1
hi canon lover , it perfect professional users who love capture excellent image . not wait longer buy soon you you not lose anything . keep it up wonderful day canon products . best wishes , appreciation canon product	1
i bought this filter my 28-135 canon lens so far it worked out great . unlike some other tiffen filters i bought , this one fits just right lens . all sides even it sits flush against lens . i haven't noticed any artifacts pictures i've taken yet , but i haven't really much chance take many pictures lens . night shots i've take so far , i've quite pleased , however	-1
got this my 580ex flashes shooting weddings . works great recycle times excellent . it last entire event filled 2500mah batteries	1
so this great starter lens , it came my canon body when i got my camera , i've used it tons . it light , smooth , fast focus , cheap . my only problem number times i found myself stepping back because 35mm end zoom wasn't wide enough . i now carry 22-55 instead love lens ( come amazon - get it stock ) . if you're budget then this lens great . if you afford little extra go 28-80 instead	-1
this great lens , amazingly sharp . only thing i would say if i money 2.8 version would even better certainly something i'll consider upgrade future . use fast shutter speed or mono/tripod this thing . anything below 250/sec gets problem 200mm	1
like many people my decision telephoto zoom lens came down buying canon 70-200mm f/4l or canon 70-300mm f/4- 5.6 usm . trade offs seemed clear first . former performs slightly better ( see canon website mtf data ) , better designed built , faster " " lens status . user comments ratings ( more than one site ) slightly more favorable lens . 70-300mm improved course longer focal length . both cost same so money not factor my decision . i eventually decided lens initially disappointed . photos ranged wonderful not very good all . fact , i almost returned lens . eventually i figured out problem . my yard heavily shaded so most initial photo taken low light i selected shutter speeds too slow . avoid camera shake you need shoot reciprocal focal length or faster . sounds simple but digital rebel xt ( which i using ) you need consider camera 1.6 multiplication factor . so 200mm you need shutter speed 1/320 or faster not 1/200 like i initially thought . once i made speed adjustment things changed better . still i some mixed feelings my decision . when light good this fantastic lens but feature offered 70-300mm i would probably get photos i miss this lens . i can't fault performance this lens its limitations i given it 5 stars . other words it what it supposed very well but my message other buyers consider where you most likely use lens before buying . remember becomes increasingly important you extend focal length . if your camera already extending it factor 1.6 you may find very attractive feature . ( note 70-300mm recall certain model numbers because problems when using lens portrait position . ) way , i purchased amazon it flawless transaction	1
what you say , other than it 4 times cheaper than 50f 1.2 . not , but great bright fast quiet lens , small optically superb . crop camera it 80mm portrait lens . super	1
this awesome lense , especially money . i would still purchase this one . there nothing second rate it . however , canon new series version their website photo . it 50 mm normal ef f/ 1.2 usm 1599 . 00 . i heard photographers who shoot whole weddings this one 3 hundred dollar lens 50mm lens .	1
i 580ex it works great . i hopeing it would work studio light but nope so dont try it . only thing you mindful distince flash subject	1
technical details this lens found abundance elsewhere , so i'll leave experts simply say : this my favorite lens . i love this lens so much . i half dozen other medium high-end lenses , this one i keep camera 90% time	1
i bought this lens when i purchased my nikon d70s february . i admit i not used it too much . however , when i used it , i am pleased results . mostly , i walking around town practicing taking photos , i little use 85mm , because it not good " point-and-shoot " scenes . when i taken portrait shots , however , 85mm very clear creates great depth field , which i find important . i hope this helpful	1
battery charger original equipment . i used it canon batteries two different no name batteries rated nb2l . all charged properly useable my canon zr500 . charger small easy travel making it unnecessary cary large quantities batteries	1
i purchased this lens take photographs vintage wristwatches . i use original canon digital rebel shots really very detailed . it easy use fact , i hand hold camera capture details hand-made craftsmanship watches . its 2.5 opening welcome change when you use shooting zoom lens it quite sharp edge edge . if you own canon digital slr want pocket some extra coin then this lens you .	1
canon ef 50mm 2.5 macro lens yet example canon doing fine job catching up likes nikon , zeiss leica respect optical design ; optically it may best 50mm macro lens currently available 35mm slr film photography . i am impressed lens cheap this counts least one aspheric lens element apochromatic lens design ; unfortunately it not nearly durable lens celebrated series lens line or canon ef 100mm macro lens . unless you constantly working out field taking close-up photography , then durability this lens lens mount barrel should not issue . more importantly user quality its images , read some test reports this lens , i no doubt it capable performer . those interested digital macro photography may choose look instead new 60mm macro lens , which optimized use canon digital slr cameras	-1
i'm no means expert ! this first digital i owned . it took me long time because i so used my film camera . but i searched long hard find what i thought i wanted . so far i am not disappointed . first size threw me because everyone else bigger camera i felt it would hard handle take good pics . but that not case . i like feel , size ... i like able throw it my purse ... it takes great pictures use my e-bay , sending family friends . i haven't any pictures printed it yet , so i don't know how exactly they come out , but i'm thinking they should okay since my online pics great . i haven't single blurry pic , both regular close up . video works well ... it lots little options i don't use .. like sounds each function , but i change those if i want . overall i no complaints	-1
hi i am surendranadha reddy i purchaged canon sd500 7.1 mp . it verygood digital camara . previously i used pantex also good , but this photos very natural realistic . one more amazon price also good . thank yousurendr	1
i not take more than one bags . this bag big enough everything .	1
i bought this bag use my canon elura 100 camcorder . camcorder these days small camera , but i knew i'd need lot room accessories this bag fit bill . i this bag right now : camcorder , 5 minidv tapes , extra battery , head cleaner , extra wide angle lens , external mic , l-bracket mounting mic , lens cleaning kit , remote control , all wires , lens filters . i still room quite bit more ! what i love this bag it really big bag doesn't all feel like big bag - that great thing me ! inside super configurable which great ' cause you set it up way best accessories you so everything fits , but doesn't move around . this same bag cost almost double best buy other retail stores so it steal here amazon ! i love it	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile .	-1
question : canon s2 only 1 color - silver . i believe this telephoto converter came only black , doesn't it look silly silver camera long black nose ? i going get this adaptor but i am holding back because it color . instead , i am looking find adaptor converter kit comes silver instead black . although i don't this converter . assuming i am satisfied its quality featuers , i would only give it only 4.5 stars because it color . anyone any ideas	-1
this hood more than adequate job controlling flare ef 100mm f/2 . additionally , hood provide protection those who 1 ) not adorne their lenses uv/sky filters , or 2 ) so adorne them ! lens already capable performer ; it moreso hood . price bit steep , but not effect its performance . thus , my rating stands	1
very convenient . easy use . paper cartridge matched up quantities smart idea . sometimes printer jams but easy clear . i find colors bit dark skin tones not balanced most attractive . if they work these items this would fantastic device i would probably keep several office , home , garage , travel ... use lot media cartridges too . i am one those takes 800-1000 pictures two week vacation so i really would use heck out these cartridges if image quality better . i usually make 3 or 4 copies each print mail friends pictures	-1
we love this produc t.t ook me minutes hook up . so easy use . i understand total cost printing few cents more than what you get costco . but . its ease use home ! specially if u guests home .... you wanna give instant photos ... hmm .... cosco/walmart .... going christmas day ..... i dont think so !!!! my guests love it .... when we give them photos .... right after party ! everybody gets kick out it ! amazon ..... goog service ! time !!!	1
purchased printer dock camera bundle , local office supply store $100 . it only came 10 picture sample cartridge , so i purchsed this amazon . amazon best price around this item free shipping . it works great . no complaints . paper not quite shiny or thick epson photo glossy paper i still use some pictures , but works well my classroom , give my students . pictures not run like some inkjet pictures if you accidentally drip water them	-1
i also sb-600 this product , sb-800 , much better - worth extra $100 . it much easier use since it simple menu structure not wierd button combo selections sb-600 . flash output better , recycle time better you use flash commander other wireless flashes . also extra battery holder fifth battery reduces recycle time further never comes off my unit . diffusion head also included so you don't buy separate one stofen ... works great	1
nikon designed this unit exploit possibilities their latest digital slrs while still compatble their oldest f-series cameras . sb-800 more expensive than sb-600 , but it gives you more control more light . you may find more light critical if you want use bounce flash soften shadows . i would given sb-800 five stars if user manual little better . nikon obviously tried very hard provide good documentation , make user interface intuitive possible . but , unit so many features modes inevitably require effort learn , present cases where you working against built automation . expect make large number experimental shots if you really want learn how use this unit . my chief plea nikon would more straight forward explanation cameras like d50 not ttl flash . so called i-ttl uses pre flashes computation set up calculated flash rather than real time measurement during exposure quench flash . one would normally expect same result , but not if slave flash used . one beauties sb-800 , however , it used slave unit using its own sensor determine when master unit firing , even if ( case d50 using its built flash ) camera sb-800 not communicating i-ttl info via ir pulses	-1
those you who d200 wondering if you need this flash consider this . d200 built flash acting commander you use sb800 off camera . just set it up it included stand coordinate flash camera conrols you now ability capture portraits look professional . set it up behind your subject , off side , angle bounce anywhere . i am sure you get idea . just one more reason why nikon great value . think what it would cost you similiar capability your canon . this flash may seem high priced but it most sophisticated unit market my opinion . good luck !	1
i'm amateur photographer , mediocre skills . this flash makes all my photos look better vs built-in , little no intervention my part . i use it digital rebel . i like flash varies intensity , depending ambient . time flashes reasonably quick ( particularly when ambient doesn't require full flash ) . avoid washed out faces , i'd always gotten accustomed bouncing flash off walls/ceiling ( my old camera setup ) . i've learned i don't need 420ex , almost always keep it directly pointed subjects ( unless i'm trying purposely create shadows across people faces ) . i also seem get much less redeye vs built	1
first off , this lens works wonderfully canon 20d , 30d 5d . image stabilization gives photographer serious edge . my experience , when active , i'm able shoot much lower speed , without any blurring . throughout range lens , image sharpness excellent , although little soft when you zoom near 300 . otherwise , 75 280 aprox . image quality astonishing . i shot weddings , sport events , low-light conditions very cold climate conditions lens performed flawlessly . ability focussing manually plus . automatic focus always accurate . just few times more than 3000 shots lens slowed bit when focusing , but i must say objets moving . weight lens ok , not too heavy , construction seems according canon standards . when shooting particular situations , silent usm mechanism really welcome feature . overall , very nice lens serious amateur photographer	1

i bought this camera my 10 year old daughter . she thrilled her own camera taken may vacation pics family . i would reccommend all beginning photographers . great price range all options . plus easy use	-1
i so much fun this lense managed take some pretty incredible pics . i use this lense probably 95% pics . i 10-22mm , 28-300mm , 100-400mm , all which take great pics but this 17-85mm works great general use	1
got it two days ago , can't say how much i love it . my camera fits perfectly , i even put my video camera . although it doesn't wheels , i move head around any direction make it stiff easily . i love double extensions legs then neck extensions minor adjustments .	1
i am 6ft tall this such perfect tripod someone who beginning/novice photographer occasional moderate use ( would my guess ) . my fort� post-production , i am graphic designer needed something use my new dig camera . i lot research tripods this seemed what i needed my usage . plastic clips concern me somewhat durability long haul , but i would love surprised just my nerves luck talking . how you beat price regardless ? i am so happy this tripod so far . i love how tall it me particularly how easy it use . i so much research online found this 70 " one said " screw it " i am tired looking bought it . i knew i needed something accomodated my height there isn't whole lot out there us tall folks decent ratings hundred below dept . i didn't pesos make " hundred+ " purchase took risk here when i rated cost versus quality ( my head ) . i feel though i won this battle now . i like two " levels " ( i noticed ) make sure i am squared up this piece equipment . equipment smooth pan i using it my own photo work , video tours my husband realtor work recreation/family photos . i am excited use this more my dig rebel . legs extend easily . metal ( light weight ) body plastic clips pieces . comes black bag hold your tripod also . easy snap-off piece remove your digital camera attach . fact i just leave it always my camera it expedites process when i am hurry . tripod feels quite sturdy my rebel attached . i think this really good-looking tripod . it so so light weight portable . i love it not clunky loud assemble when pulling it straight out trunk/car quickly assembly . i would've liked seen manual recommended usage ways maximizing longevity product , but i am over it product great so far . ( revise 1 0-0 9-06 ) still love love this tripod . i use it all time . so easy use it so lightweight i just toss it trunk . so quick set up too . love it ... it rocks ( tall gal ) . :	-1
i purchased this gift my brother-in-law . he over 6 ft tall wanted tripod he didn't bend over use . i couldn't find one locally , very happy find this one online . he very happy his gift ! highly recommended	1
this grip great value price paid . batteries alone worth money spent . i've banged this around week out rugged bruce peninsula no problems it . i would recommend this anyone needing grip . money you save you put towards your next lens	1
i know it sounds too good true , i've read too many reviews where people say " i never knew how i ever took pictures without this grip , " but it truth . first thing i noticed vertical handle , it amazing . you shoot vertical shots one hand ! all buttons you need grip , shutter button , wheel , two buttons top right xt . installation , it joke , don't even read manual . you charge batteries , but mean time you put your regular canon battery , or 6 aas because this comes aa shell . think it this way , xt baby ... it easy hold if you small hands ; i don't , i knew camera small , i decided buy this really so i could better handle it , extra battery life whipping cake . i really don't know how i could stand hold camera without this grip . don't spend extra money canon model , this one perfect	1
my husband bought me this camera early christmas gift . first i wasn't love it . i disappointed because i wanted camera image stablization . this camera instead boasted its iso sensitivity settings fast shutter speed . ( they claimed it similar image stablization ) when i first tried it out i very low light setting experiencing some blur my images which exactly what i trying avoid new camera ! i almost traded this one something different ( cheaper priced olympus ) but thankfully i gave camera chance first decided play around all manual settings . there lot them menus so you fine tune it like you wouldn't believe . this ability change its setup what made me stick sony . however , i wouldn't say this camera ideal very low light situations . two preset choices shooting low-light scene without flash won't give you crystal clear pictures especially if you experience tiny bit camera shake . but again , it goes back adjustments menus , you make manual adjustments get pretty decent pictures minumal ( or no ) blur . but you take time find set right iso light settings . i highly suggest using histogram you pop-up onto screen help . unless you willing spend $200 more camera , you won't find one perform great very low light anyway . like my husband said ... " really ... how often you taking shots dark honey ? " hey , there halloween trick-or-treating fouth july fireworks other night time events i retorted , but he right . there really isn't lot real low-light pictures you take where you aren't using flash . i know lots people ( me included ) like try figure out all menu options settings their own before reading manual ... but this one , if you really want super amazing shots , reading manual give you lot insight how powerful camera it really . people always read manual this probably big " duuuh " ! but if you like me like try rush through figure it out , you missing out ton nice options . some great features : camera doubles video camera it only limited recording up amt space available your memory stick . other cameras only let you record pre-set maximum number minutes . i also like burst modes which allow you take shots fast succession . great action shots . but take note , when using burst mode you cannot use flash . ( again , watch out low light ! )i 3 year old daughter fast shutter speed ( burst ) works great well lit situation . just other day i caught shots her running around jumping up down came out crystal clear . no blur all . every flying bouncing hair her head came out perfectly frozen time . quite neat ! i gave this camera 4 stars because camera performs wonderfully every situation except very low light . but price , you can't much better anyway . its great buy i think just anyone would pleased receive it gift .	-1
i am very pleased this item . size right , resolution photos perfect . i am enjoying using camera	1
i am new slrs i cant belive how good this camera . this camera worth every penny amazing quality it produces . i always thot my old digital pics point shoot excellent , but looking back , they look terrible compared this .	1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
it performs you'd expect . bar holds paper place , cutter cuts paper . i also got perforating scoring blades , those also work very well . using cutter perforator , i've made several custom-size notebooks tear-out pages	1
i weddings , portrait , outdoor photography i don't see any reason why i'd ever switch d70 ( other than d80 :) . this camera professional grade consumer price point . don't scared 6.1 mp . i print 20x30 all time w/ out any problems . i'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1
kodak p880 remarkable bargain produces astonishing photos . its 8 megapixels zoom lens it operates like more expensive slr . quality photos , even highest zoom , astounding . anyone interested easy operate , high quality camera , this one	1
this third 8 meg sd camera i tried - it only one without using tripod indoors gave me sharp , crisp pictures most time . zoom smaller fuji or panasonic , but color saturation sharpness heads shoulders above others . excellent camera shoots jpg , tiff raw	1
this real thing . it seems impossible get anywhere i got it overnight amazon . wow	1
this camera amazing . i canon user many years , upgrading i go . i not think right now camera they could come out make me want upgrade 5d . this certainly my camera some time come	1
if you've considering digital full frame camera ( who hasn't ? ) this one doesn't cost arm leg . now kodak out picture , your choices eos 5d or 1ds mark ii , which costs more than twice much . you give up few things , such super-fast frame rate continuous shooting , but 5d resolution you need top-quality images , ability get true wide angle perspectives your ef lenses . i happened shoot this camera concert side-by-side vendor " " camera , both under available light 85mm f/ 1.8 lenses range isos . i found some shots i liked other camera , shot iso 400 , comparable shots 5d which , my surprise , turned out exposed iso 3200 . 5d absolutely lives up its low noise reputation . but don't take my word it , try one out yourself	1
just got 5d .. traded my 20d ... 5d more solid camera full frame sensor ... pictures great it easy use if you familiar canon system ... little pricey , but worth it !! you'll use it years	1
i bought canon eos 20d digital slr canon ef 75-300mm zoom lens take photographs my children various sporting events . magnification factor this lens perfect variety sporting events including lacrosse , basketball , swimming gymnastics . focusing speed very good capturing action shots . i highly recommend this lens affordable general purpose zoom lens	1
monopod functions i hoped price excellent dea	-1
great product price . however , amazon not specify how much it handle . my experience 5 lb . tried 8 lb it , start feel shaky . still usable if you handle it carefully , but not solid 8 lb load	1
it works just like one comes camera . comes little plastic bag	-1
we received our usb cable promptly . you know kodak usb cables special they not fit any other regular devices uses usb cable . these usb cables kodak only . product itself turned out everything it represented	1
case great ! it fits camera perfectly exactly what i expected receive when ordering . price right but shipping little higher than i expected	1
it gives proteccion handling you looking . buy it camera no regrets	1
works designed , performs well intended lens , construction plastic though	1
what wonderful lens !! i'm purely hobby shooter , but i like take nice shots . i took this zoo other day able take fantastic closeups polar bears , even through glass , pick out details butterfly wings . lens not heavy i feared , unlike some zooms it not telescope out under its own weight , so it comfortable enough keep carrying all day . i'm using it canon d60 am nothing but pleased performance so far	1
i am generally pleased this lense , if i could only carry one lense my digital rebel , this one i would take	-1
i found this lens resonable all around lens , although when it comes portaits or close-ups i would recomend canon 100mm f/ 2.8 macro . if your looking camera use it i would highly recomend canon 10d wow	-1
good advice other reviewer picture . said i three these really wouldn't want without them . these clean my camera screen glass my lenses without scratch every time . my opinion almost must your bag ! good luck	1
i am new slrs i cant belive how good this camera . this camera worth every penny amazing quality it produces . i always thot my old digital pics point shoot excellent , but looking back , they look terrible compared this .	1
it extremely easy use . hard figure out menu , but once there no problem . takes beautiful pictures . great action shots well . seldom find blurry photo it stabelizer built	1
i digital cameras 5 years still own olympus 5 megapixel , casio 7 megapixel . seems like megamixels alone just don't cut it me . i read rebel xt magazine looked up user reviews here amazon . i decided go buy one though i am really novice , i am extremely impressed . i never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors point shoot . i started basic settings love results . i am slowly progressing more advanced settings am getting better everyday . even novice who just wants stunning photography amazed this camera . i also bought tamron 75-300 autofocus zoom lens ( look it here amazon.com ) after lots practice , able take some great pictures . i brother uk who also into digital photography , after seeing some ( full reso ) photos i sent him , he rushed out bought xti ( called eos 400d across pond)and amazed it . i still lot learn but really cannot fault this camera . included software also excellent . record , some reviews seem think it too small hold , i big hands don't any problems all . i admit though this first slr i ever owned . i still keep point shoot keep my travel bag spontaneous photography but i am love my rebel xt !! this camera costs quite chunk change but i think it well worth it i recommend it everyone	1
dscw100 8.1 great shirt pocket point shoot easy menu directions added features built	1
ive it couple months now . i notice no difference it my canon bp511 . my only gripe it its cheazy silver plastic color , but hey , who looks your batteries	-1
bought this lens ' standard ' prime lens my digital rebel xt . what i found it fast , sharp , lightweight lens made camera great long walks . this would perfect lens take amusement park , hiking , or biking where size weight concern . i've also used this lens macro photography portraits where it shines . f2 bokeh wonderful center sharpness superb even f2 , much better f4 which what i use most time . negative side , autofocus noisy . compare , it like drug-crazed wasp trapped matchbox . maybe mosquito buzzing close your ear . it not louder than shutter , though . if this film camera i trying take candid shots , i'd complain more , but it 56mm equivelant lens . negative build quality . they really should make body this lens out thicker plastic . no reason skimp there ' feel ' lens certainly gives you much more confidence very little weight penalty . make it feel solid . i've got 52-55mm step-up ring it i've got slew 55mm filters . this also helps lens cap further body lens easier remove replace . if canon made faster lens 28mm same price point , i would gone way . my tastes , it would preferable extra field view assuming quality good	1
extremely pleased prompt service well pric	1
exceptional perfomance long life makes this battery great deal . always good back -up this battery comes handy	1
we bought this second battery sony w50 digital camera . these batteries , this camera , last long time . spare allows us keep one external charger swap quickly when needed . it original sony product so fits works perfectly	1
sure beats price buying polarizer , uv 2 nd filters individually	1
just got slingshot 100 my nikon d50 kit lens . previously , i bought nikon bag but this just bag fit camera nothing else , i found this unpractical . d50 fits perfectly slingshot 100 , though i readjust velcro camera compartment dividers first . this quite disappointing i almost no free space my camera compartment anymore ! i guess canon 350d , which smaller body , fit this bag better . anyway i no other lenses yet ( 18-200 still order ) so all my gear ( battery , memory cards etc . ) finds place this bag . bag fits very well , comfortable well-made . before buying though , check if your camera lens fit	-1
this bag very sturdy padded . description pretty scanty , but i took chance bought it . glad i . bag holds my jvc gr-dvl805u mini dv camcorder , strap , battery , ac adaptor cord , 4 tapes , remote , all connector cables . it kind tight squeeze all those accesories , but bag compact , comfortable , easy carry , camcorder still protected . bag also comes lifetime guarantee against defect . only thing could improved it awkward get camcorder or out bag while carrying it strap over shoulder ; zipper hard reach goes all way around top . that only thing could improved , could considered safety feature , because camcorder certainly won't come out unexpectedly . bag also very durable nice looking . i recommend it	1
i love using it , long exposure , great bulb . cheap cool .	1
15 years photography experience here ... sigma 15mm fisheye extensively reviewed compared other websites ( go ahead search ) this very good product . canon tighter focus * touch * faster focusing , but massive depth field this lens , it not problem all . aware if you use this 1.6 crop factor digital slr aps sensors like my 20d or digital rebel , then fisheye effect not pronounced film or 1.3 or full frame digital slrs . watch lens flare should direct sunlight hit it also ... but happens any lens protruding or bulbous lenses . this much better bang buck lens than canon equivalent which costs significantly more . if you search around , you find much lower prices this lens	1
marine pack dsc-n1 good enough get job . camera special housing setting change functionality camera so it used case . unfortunately , this means losing ability use manual settings . luckily , camera fine figuring out its own settings , though occasionally get picture just right you need it yourself . i taken case 130 feet several times never experienced leak	1
i love this camera . it everything you'd want compact point shoot camera . perfect taking pictures my toddler . fits your pocket starts up split second . never miss " kodak moment " .	1

you reading non technical review your average fun photographer . so don't expect lot technical stuff . i finally stepped up fuji s9000 . i loved my fuji cameras ease use colors they produce . i little reluctant spend kind money it takes get into d80 . i am thrilled i . i finally digital camera when kids something i catch it opposed camera taking shot after they left room . super fast . few saturdays ago i outside our wooded back yard taking pictures changing colors trees . when i went take shot flash popped up . i said this isn't right sun filtering though trees but i took shot anyway . wow camera new what . unbelievable photos . easy handle even pistolgrip mb d80 . i also sprung sb600 flash great two dvd training program ebay . so don't afraid spend couple grand d80 accesories . you glad you . happy alabam	1
i market buy new camera last year walked into bestbuy alone just browsing . i older eos canon rebel 35mm camera 1992 , i loved camera too . so this my second camera purchase , not sure what i wanted , but i knew what i wanted take pictures . i take this camera everywhere , vacations , visiting friends family , take pictures scenery , sporting events , people . there lot options this camera i don't know how use , but can't wait learn them too . i upgraded my memory card 1 gb so i take lot pictures not worry running out room . when i travel or go sporting event , i take anywhere 75 200 piictures . i get lot compliments camera photos it takes great	1
incredible quality zoom ! low power consumption . buy 1gb sandisk compact flash card . it gives you plenty room 2-3 week vacation	1
great kit ! i haven't used any filters before but i tell i'll using these quite bit	1
after getting sd600 gift , i knew i get case it . i really didn't like any cases store wanted something custom fit . this case completely solid camera fits snugly it . i no problem taking camera or out but it not any wiggle room while it case . also case magnetic button close added security . overall , great buy	1
just what i expected , since this second one i purchased . i one , bought camera this case my daughter . case protects camera lcd screen , but still small enough fit pocket or easily purse	1
i like color . it fits camera perfectly . it really cute not bulky . it not just ordinary black camera case everyone else . it classy	1
don't buy this camera really . i it month taking good care it . i initially thrilled . lcd screen got damaged -- no i didn't drop it . treatment customer service so poor disturbing i shocked . customer service representative actually questioned my integrity proceed talk me if i idiot . $181 repair bill $300 camera not feasible . it great camera first , but i demand better treatment respect company . look better camera , look web comments their customer service don't buy this camera . i read very negative things sony but didn't think they applied -- they really true . i don't like called liar anyone especially when i am customer . camera month old it now garbage . while i understand policies policies terms warranty , i not accept such poor treatment customer service . i teach photography tell my students same thing -- if customer service respect matter you , then not buy this camera .	-1
this camera very slim like canon elphs but costs much less . it very high resolution easy use . battery lasts long time 2.5 " lcd screen very clear big . it lot different shooting modes , including custom mode where you set specific parameters like infinity lock or iso speed . convenience , every time you switch modes , screen tells you what mode should used , so you don't need carry around manual figure out how shoot your pictures .	1

i through 6 cameras past 3 years , all different kinds brands price . i changed so many times because they get stolen or broken ... this little pentax optio surprising though ! 3 months after it around , i brought it desert it got some sand it , but i it fixed . this same camera also fell three floors down nothing damaged ; neither screen , lens , nor flash . it just got cracked bit twisted , battery/memory card cover completely damaged , but it still works like it should !	1
i just got this camera month ago i am satisfied it . it lot features despite its size . point shoot i say it great buy , comparable other power packed cameras , it even takes better pictures sometimes . but i just give it 4 because i thought i could more it . but you can't much settings since it it own default settings certain conditions . but over all it great camera . if you're just after taking normal pictures you want something sleek , this definitely good buy .	-1
i'll keep this short , i assume most tec stuff covered . i sold 350d get 400d(xti ) . 400d focuses better , better ergonomics , same size/weight , takes great photos . i tried nikon d80 , but it loses way too much detail iso 400 up . plus canon line lenses fits my needs better , cheaper , available . nikon costs $300 more ( canon discounted ) , nikon raw converter adds $150 . so true cost difference $400-450 . i'd buy canon over nikon same price due image quality , especially if you shoot jpeg . btw , if you afford canon lenses(the 25-105l 70-200l-any 4 ) amazing . one caveat , any dslr , these cameras not p/s best some post processing knowledge how camera meters/exposes , etc . i can't emphasize this enough	1
i this camera week now . i bought ef 28-105mm lens seperatly . i don't know why , but auto focus not work right away . it took some fiddling around before i able use feature . i get gorgeous pictures this camera . my one complaint it feels small right hand . after 1/2 hour shooting pictures my hand got cramp . i small hands it still felt small me . if you considering this camera i'd go store see how it feels . i can't imaging able use it long time if you big hands . i'm still learning how use it . but so far its meeting all my expectations .	-1
while this lens great improvement over kit lenses focus often soft raw modes overal just not always tight . color accuracy very good , not perfect but very good . course color accuracy more often result your paper ( yes really - it ) than your lens after you get certain point . after using this lens 2 months shooting perhaps 20,000 shots it i wished i saved my money inevitable series lens . if color accuracy your main issue , sure look your photo paper too . hp , kodak , even low end papers inkpress all strang things color blur your images . try someone like moab paper . you amazed how much difference it make your color accuracy detail . i just switched kokapelli moab commercial prints am amazed results . usually case focus softest 3.5 though it produce surprisingly decent bokeh	-1
bottom line : i needed replace lens my canon rebel xt d-slr . ef-s first glance seemed like perfect replacement since canon produced ef-s series specifically compressed sensor d-slr line . after weighing pros cons two , i chose this ef lens largely basis price . it right choice , i haven't found any loss features or quality . multiplying range 1.6 35mm equivalence ( if you rebel xt , 20d or 30d ) , this model really just slightly wide angle stronger telephoto zoom . ( 45mm-170mm if it 35mm film camera ) if this range suits you , then this lens excellent value over ef-s wide-angle/telephoto zoom . you'll keep all features , save money faster lens . ef series meshes well current line canon digital slrs . addition , unlike ef-s series , they compatible all canon eos products including higher-end cameras like mark ii . specific observations weeks use : my first concern before purchasing this lens minimum focus distance 0.5 meters , or approximately 18 inches . i lot macro work transferring images into digital , so i tad worried . however , after getting lens zooming , i realized focusing distance wasn't really issue after all . most cases , i could manage stand six or so inches further away still get highly magnified shot . so you see macro function works well , i've uploaded image small hamster photographed 102mm . ( aperature pretty big -- after all , hamster moving target)my second concern lens quality sharpness , particularly wide-angle setting near edges photo . this lens exceeded my expectations . so you see quality this lens , i've uploaded uncropped picture sf bay bridge taken 28mm wide-angle setting . you'll see photo sharp all way through edges frame . ( it web-sized jpeg , so you should take into consideration use it mainly see sharpness photo , particularly near outside edges)i get unexpected bonus this lens . manual focus ring front . i love it . disabling auto-focus snap , position feel manual focus perfect sports or social activities where subject often not closest object . ring itself ridged made rubber , making handling breeze . while i hadn't expected replace my stock lens so soon , i think it ended up best . this lens actually superior one came xt . i lost some wide-angle function but gained much more telephoto . price excellent quality lens high .	1
ok start off i've heard different opinions camera sensor blowers .. some say it works like magic some say it make it worse . so i gambled bought this giotto blower . i didn't want buy all cleaning swabs , liquid ect rub it off ... seemed like annoying project . so i gave this blower try . i never much dust my sensor but when made my aperture smaller f/22 exact picture blue sky i noticed few blobs or dust spots . i wanted them off ... now heres where blower comes . i used it total 3 times it removed 98% dust off my sensor .. thats really really good my book $9 device . now i like 2 tiny dust spots my sensor i easily live .. or i could try use it few more times completely get it off ... meantime i'm very happy dust i got off it . buy this blower .... its no brainer .	1
i owned giottos rocket air blaster 2 weeks now love it . i use it blowing dust everything : camera lenses , computer screens out computer keyboards . it made nice soft material allows it stored flat out way . additionally , it creates sufficient pressure force away most dust particles course requires no canned air , it works you pump it . i'll never forced air again	1
best feature this flash wireless e-ttl feature . two 550ex one work master one slave st-e2 both flashes off camera fired e-ttl . draw backs : price , no manual control slave mode greater light control , size ( this thing big ) . plus side weighs out negatives . it great flash	1
this camera steal . reviews amazon helped me decide this camera sure it worth it .	1
after hearing consumer reports gave canon a520 best buy rating , i decided this must good family cameras . it joy own use . easy take pictures , easy work yes , it takes great pictures . it more bells it than i ever use . i very satisfied 4 5 mp cameras not wanted spend fortune more . i just need take pictures , review them easily download my computer . this much , much more	1
i never take my uv filter off my lens unless i am going immediately put different filter . there basically two camps out there , those feel you should always use uv filter protect your lens dirt scratches those feel it waste time only degrades your image . well , i tried going without one awhile then dirt started build up front element my very expense lens . although you clean front element lens , i feel much , much safer wiping my comparatively cheap uv filter time time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage . i think nearly unquantifiable loss image quality you may suffer uv filter , it well worth extra piece mind it gives me	-1
very small size ( fits my baggy jean pocket ) , fast startup , fast response when shooting picture . much easier carry around than my canon g3 . not well indoors when flash needed . lots red eye , much more than my canon g3	-1
optics best i've ever seen . clarity great . abillity focus small objects only 2 " away allows great macro pictures . however auto focus much slower than most canon lenses , but i focus manually . this my favotite lens ever	1
4 starts because otherwise 5 stars inevitable : 1 ) slow autofocus ( hunt times ) but expected macro lens . 2 ) built quality not solid expected this price range . i bought this lens instead two purpose : macro portrait ! i thinking buying 100mm macro plus 85mm 1.8 but this lens saves me buying two lenses ! i very happy it what it . i don't flying insects very much so it not problem but said i able get 1:1 shot fly , see sample here : http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_54.htmlthere other samples this gallery here : http://www.theteh.com/html/my_3rd_350d_xt.htmlthe large aperture ( 2.8 ) means one could shallow dof great low light such this pic : http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_49.htmlfor portrait , i accidentally took this photo during london bombing women ' shocked ' incident unfolding public tv display . it coincident her background inmage winning reuter photo tsunami tragedy matching colour their dresses ! i quite far away so able capture her head toe : http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_25.htmlthis illustrate capability both macro normal photography using this lens . you not regret it unless your primary aim shoot flying insets where longer 100mm or 150mm macro lenses may needed this case .	-1
this lens well worth price . first thing you notice quality when you handle lens . it very solid construction . but once you mount lens where it really shines . clarity focus best i've seen focus super fast . macro functionality just awesome . i highly recommend this lens	1
this battery works my canon sd550 interchangeably withthe canon nb3l came it . i get many shots either one .	1
product great ! you should get it . usually , i'm skeptical abour getting generic brands , but this works perfectly	1
incredible piece equipment almost give away price . i no complaints this camera surpasses what i expected	1
this review really two parts : one amateur who using point shoots , or experience film based slrs ; other one prosumer or advanced amateur who either going digital film canon eos bodies or getting into pro-level digital shooting low end . former , camera pretty much all you need ; latter , it lacking key functionality , but workable . i'm latter category . i've freelance photo work past , but not since digital age began take off late ' 90s . i've shooting eos cameras since early ' 90s , added medium format late ' 90s wedding portrait work . i'll honest : i didn't like idea digital first . sure , workflow improvements over film sounded great , but i wasn't seeing quality digital vs . film . i still am very much believer , least prints , especially big prints , film delivers better overall picture quality . but quality digital slrs since release digital rebel so good , workflow advantages trump film all but rare situations . i'll still use my medium format equipment landscape outdoor pics i'll print large frame , but other than pocket 35mm , i can't see using film much all category , after seeing what i dreb . if you primarily amateur who either used using point shoot ( film or digital ) or who used consumer film slr , you'll find this camera easy operate use extent you used your other cameras . i bought this without lens , i other lenses packaged one didn't offer me anything , but those without canon glass , you get surprisingly good lens kit . remember , though , lens only fit digital rebel , its successors , possibly 10/20d line canon eos bodies . shooting pretty simple . charge battery , which easy -- charger blinks depending upon its charge . you look charger battery there see where you , charge wise . it doesn't take very long charge battery fully . once you battery camera , you'll need compact flash card . i recommend sandisk ultra ii cards . you won't experience any write time problems over above this camera natural limitations . then , set iso value ( 100-1600 ) , set either pre-programed mode one side dial , or traditional program/shutter priority/apeture priority settings other side , you ready rock . remember unlike many digital cameras , led back camers not function viewfinder . aside displaying various camera options , it shows what you shot after shooting . if you want use this advanced amateur/pro setup , you , but know its limitations . i bought this march shooting all sports it . i'm using canon usm lens , gotten some terrific shots . but i've also missed some led me decide sell this camera pick up 20d . problem i get into focusing speed zones . 2.5 fps only 4 frame burst isn't big problem it sounds . i still get good action burst mode , but admittedly 5 fps 22 or 25 ( 20d ) bursts much better . if you want use this shoot something like concerts or indoor events , you won't same focusing issues . you deal any flash limitations , but information , you read review . i'm not camera flash guy under any definition . only real problem i've this camera my shots consistently underexposed . 5- . 7 stop . i shoot exclusively raw mode ( never shot jpg this one other than first dozen or so shots ) it correctable when i convert images . this more minor irritation , may not noticable jpeg shots . i've seen others using this camera complain it well . this camera good consumer camera you find . if pro , or semi-pro , make something function his or her needs , you know consumer get everything they need out this . i've shooting since i 8 or so , owned umpteen cameras , this one fills its market niche good any them	1
i've owned one these cameras four years now , i very pleased it . it light , small easy carry . it takes beautiful pictures -- very sharp , good colors . pictures look good even when you blow them up so big you see individual pixels . it actually my second camera like this . first problem usb port side camera , i took it back store traded it new one . this camera also problem too , after two years , button back needed making settings stopped working properly . but still , considering cost camera quality pictures , i buying one . it worth it .	-1
i tried several digit-cams say you cannot find better camera this price . pros : + great value , low price+ easy handling+ portability , light weight+ great fuji colours , good auto white balance+ fast shutter response , close film cameras+ control over exposure , flash pre-programmed white balance+ it uses aa , great battery life+ changig images playback mode doesn't take hours+ excellent prints photoscons : - images noisier than competition ( but they more expensive also)- images too much compressed , therefore less detail , no control over jpeg compression ( but this same most fuji models unfortunately)- no control over iso- low resolution lcd , too dark low-light- no optical zoom ( but this price it ok)- camera cheap feel it ( but again , this price it ok)- weak flash outdoor night shots , but enough smaller room shots- flash recharge time takes few seconds , camera freezes ( but this same most fuji models unfortunately)- it uses expensive xd-cards- sluggish zooming panning playback mode- no sound videoi highly recommend this camera beginners or those who doesn't want spend more digital camera . i've read many negative reviews due it bad photo indoors . okay , it not canon g3 . first i thought same , but then set controls manual , set exposure up highest value then shot picture . end result much better than full auto mode . so my advice indoors low-light set exposure manually , you'll glad you i promise . colours well balanced , prints come out great , no matter how noisy images , you won't notice photo paper . this model now out sale , but if you find second-hand one good price don't afraid buy it , it excellent buy	-1
great camera , easy use after reading manual . light , easy handle . unfortunately little pricey	-1
this great camera those who need more than point shoot but not want carry bag full lenses . also , large sd card ( 1 4 gb ) this camera replace your video camera . one thing note , when you take pictures while recording video , it stops recording second or two while it processes your picture . this very obvious when watching your video	1

this it . i upgraded sigma ex 2.8 80-200 . i should spent money nikon first time . sigma very nice lens less , good alternative , but if you want it all , go nikon . leave your tripod home when you get this glass . i don't know how this compares , but i'm shooting hand held 1/30s shutter full zoom ( 35mm equivalent 300mm ) . vr phenomenal , wide aperature delivers beautiful blur , overall fit construction flawless . tack sharp images too	1
yes , this lens already legend , no , it not just bunch people trying justify spending whole lot cash lens . make no mistake , this lens big expensive . it not fitting into your travel bag nor it home friend party . bring 18-70mm , 28-200g or just bring cheaper ps type camera case you spill beer it ! 70-200 vr pro level lens gets almost everything right . it size byproduct optical design really makes few , if any compromises . this lens sharp ... sharp my 50mm prime sharper wide open you might believe or expect . d70 focus lightening fast quite exact . color rendition best i've seen . i much less post processing when this baby d70 . problematic side , this lens big . it heavy way , though reasonably easy grasp . i added harbortronics portrait grip handling/balance improved . it needs big bag focuses down bit under 5 feet . while it fantastic portrait lens , you need room get most out it . my first shots this lens put my more experienced lenses shame . bokeh , or quality out-of-focus areas creamy pleasing . subjects 3d quality them . vr system exactly what you'd expect . i sat my couch , framed text my dvd player 8 feet away shot f/ 2.8 iso 200 1/2 second exposure . 200mm ( 300mm d70 ) image sharp . without vr i got big blur . real question : you need 1700 dollar lens ? answer : only if you want it . quality all there level people talking this lens like it magic . i friends who shoot pro canon nikon . even canon users say 70-200vr best it kind . sell kidney buy one	1
puts protective glass over your expensive gla$$ without distortion .	1
after overpaying fancy camera store , i happy purchase identical filter amazon fraction price . these filters give you piece mind , protection sand , fingerprints baby spittle	1

this camera easy take anywhere , easy operate best all takes great pictures my 2 boys . highly recommended .	-1
i very small camera ( canon sd450 ) find this tripod perfect match . it light small easy carry included canvas case . it few nice features i didn't expect ( even though i read text ! ) like bubble level platform . this product excellent value . however , shipping cost much tripod . course , not tripod fault .	1
this cleaning pen just advertised . i used it daily basis since i got it , it never failed great job . i use this visibledust huricane blower , combo unbeatable . great value price	1
i skeptical when i ordered pen because i wasn't too sure how clean it would really keep my lens . last week i traveled through out mexico visited some beautiful places , seeing lot family members . all these family members around , few accidently touched my lenses . i decided it would perfect time test my new pen . end result ? perfection ! lenses looked like thru brand new ! i used carry little paper whipes designed lenses , but now i use nikon lens pen i don't need worry carrying whipes throwing them away	1
when it comes cleaning my digital camera lenses , i'm very afraid damaging something , so this little cheap product takes away all fear , all dust my lenses . --- cuando se trata de limpiar los lentes de mi camara , me da mucho miedo que se da�e , entonces con este peque�o barato producto , fuera miedo fuera polvo	1
over 90% pictures i took this canon blurry . no way you fix it . i really got fed up it . waist your money . waist your time . more important , waist your precious moments !	-1
don't buy this camera !!! prone " memory error " e18 errors after warranty up . cost min $150 plus shipping fix . this camera great until 23 months went then i started mysteriously losing pictures due file format errors . i switched memory cards it happened again . then " memory error " displayed after month or so losing pictures . now it doesn't work all . i called canon see what type service could provided if they would fix what appears factory defect since so many people reported this problem . minimum cost $150 or i could upgrade refurb s500 $199 w/6 month warranty . they kidding , $250 get me new one . what appears common problem i expecting more canon . guess i won't buying canon . google this " canon " memory error " e18 " see yourself canon cameras problems .	-1
this flash unbelievable , most time i use built-in filter because it so powerful , great value money . just takes some practice getting it adjusted correctly i said before it really throws light out there . highly recommended	-1
well priced works beautifully . no complaints - exactly what it said tin .	1
this excellent camera ! i purchased mine feb . ' 06 used it continually 2+ months before i decided write this review . first , i am avid amateur photographer , i wondered if this camera would worth expense , non-pro . i've found i not regret this purchase any way . i researched it several months even bought digital rebel xt first , thinking i'd rather not spend so much camera ( i like rebel xt it fun back up camera ) .... i confused which camera choose . most official reviewers either not review it , because there not " much " difference btw . it id mark ii or simply said if you wanted shoot sports or fast action , then 1d mark ii way go . i don't shoot those ... i'm wedding/portrait person . however , i also shoot landscapes fast moving animals well wanted weather proofing speed comes mark ii . so choosing 5 , ( time ) upcoming 30d 1d mark ii very difficult . one pro review site said mark ii needless upgrade mark ii . i found odd remark because canon changed almost everything they didn't like mark ii . you record both raw jpeg same time , different cards . 2.5 " lcd magnified any point , check sharpness , there definite absence noise shadowed areas you not pair this lense get excellent photos . aside my lenses , i use 50mm 1.4 , 70-300 85mm 1.8 excellent image quality across board . i am small woman found camera weight takes some time get used . however , camera itself so fast it compensated any camera shake i might , due weight , it speed . , now i am used it , i hardly notice it . multitude control buttons confusing , but if you used 1d mark ii , it not difficult switch . if you used rebel xt , keep manual handy your first few times out . whether you shoot jpeg or raw , photos manipulate well photoshop you don't lose any quality ( my opinion ) not 12 megapixels 5d ( which 1 only 2 reasons why i considered 5d ) . large enlargments ( 16x20 ) print up quite excellently again , you speed never miss shot . i've found shooting portraits difficult shoot subjects ( children , pets , someone who doesn't want sit portrait but his wife making him ... ) , speed matter often it saved me failed shoot ! 1.3 fov crop factor ( vs . full frame 5d ) definitely factor weighed . frankly , i use 17-40l get excellent landscape photos . wide ( 22mm ) i could ever wish , not get " fish-eye " . so , i don't find crop factor personal issue but it something i take into consideration my choice . while it limits my 24-70l my 24-105l only 31.2 mm wide angle , it gives my 70-300 " just enough " extra zoom boost ( 390mm ) i don't buy yet expensive lens . i've trying think negatives this camera , order give balanced review . i said , initially weight issue well learning controls . both quickly overcome . cost definitely factor , but especially anyone who this living , it definitely worth $ . i like everything this camera ( i've gone through several others get here ) . when i don't it me , find myself my a620 ( my " purse " emergency camera ) i get so frustrated a620 won't anything even close what i've now come expect standard all cameras . so i guess that one downside , because it large slr , i don't carry it absolutely ( though almost ! ) everywhere . however , overall , unless you want pay close $7k ds extra megapixels , i don't believe there better camera market . i realize while this review doesn't cover all technical specs ( you get either cnet.com or the-digital-picture.com ) i hope it helps someone like me who really difficult time making ultimate decision	1
this my first digital camera . i received it anniversary present ; my fiance thankfully * great * taste . anyhow , this particular camera took far best photos i ever seen ! pictures extremely crisp . i thought camera very user friendly lot fun use . i used it 13 months without single problem . until it stolen . :( so now i decided upgrade canon sd700 . way , i tried out all my friend family digital cameras just compare theirs my canon not single one theirs could compare pictures my canon a520 took ... so try it out , you won't disappointed !!!	1
i purchased this extender so i could more comfortable looking through viewfinder . 5/8ths inch doesn't seem like big difference , but it enough put some space your face camera . your face pressed against camera good thing , it helps stabilize camera reducing camera shake . however i find 20d very uncomfortable without extender . my discomfort comes more how eyepiece cushion rests eye not so much smashed nose . extender doesn't prevent camera pressing against my nose , although it clearly doesn't press much . my face still contact back camera . eyepiece cushion feels more comfortable pressed against eye extender place . install , you remove eyepiece cushion camera , slip extender then reattach eyepiece cushion extender . extender reduce magnification viewfinder , but not enough issue me . extenders purchased your eye glass prescription strength mind so one doesn't need wear their glasses when using camera . this particular extender not correct vision . this extender stays my camera all times . pros : gives your nose some breathing room . adds comfortcons : reduces magnification viewfinder	-1
i weddings , portrait , outdoor photography i don't see any reason why i'd ever switch d70 ( other than d80 :) . this camera professional grade consumer price point . don't scared 6.1 mp . i print 20x30 all time w/ out any problems . i'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1

this excellent add-on close-up lens , not confused relatively inexpensive 1-2-4 sets sold aftermarket accessories . this double-element achromatic ( color-corrected ) lens made canon recommended lenses range 50-135mm focal length . it very sharp clear no color fringing . " 250 " indicates maximum distance subject 250mm main lens focussed infinity . actual lens power 4.0 diopters (+4 ) . it 58mm outer thread so you add clear filter ( uv or skylight ) protect lens surface . i am using it canon a620 required adapter , it produces outstanding pictures excellent detail sharpness .	1
i shoot canon 20d used canon ef 28-135mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 usm lens my wide angle option . when preparing extended stay budapest , i decided it time invest faster , better quality wa lens . i reviewed lens lineup canon website decided canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 . lens owner , i confident this lens would great addition my lens lineup . lens , this serious lens meant serious photographers . sturdy construction consists three aspherical elements canon ud glass which largely eliminate secondary spectrum . weather-resistant construction lens mount , zoom focus rings switch panel helps protect lens elements . this lens not compatible 1.4 ii 2x ii extenders . canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 lens weighs 1.3 lbs/600g , accepts 77mm filters or holds gel filters . sure get good quality uv haze filter protect front lens element . not only i see this good practice , canon recommends doing so their site well . focus type standard twist zoom , permits auto or manual focus depending how switch set . addition , lens usm drive mechanism optimum af performance . included this lens front rear lens caps , lens hood , soft storage case , us one year warranty . case pull string soft case ( lz1319 ) also purchased separately . lens hood ( ew-83e ) used reduce lens flare protect front element certain situations . i admit i disappointed this lens while budapest . i found wide angle scenes focused subject distance , images soft . this precisely type images i wanted use this lens . just because this fast lens , it doesn't mean i shoot everything f/ 2.8 either some may claim . i good understanding exposure know how use aperture setting my advantage . it didn't matter what aperture i used , distant subjects soft my eyes . i wondered if lens needed adjusting or calibrating after hearing all great things people say . i lent lens friend who loved quality sharpness while taking close up shots . i then began wonder if i doing something wrong . after testing lens , i've concluded this not lens distant wide angle shots like suggested canon website . when subject matter much closer , like other side room or several feet away , this awesomely sharp lens . canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 lens too different compare canon ef 28-135mm . clarity sharpness incredible close-up shots , auto-focus quiet quick . even though this lens didn't fit my original purpose , it found place my lens collection . i don't foresee this lens one my most used options though . canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 comes price , but it worth every penny when used its strengths . pros : incredible clarity sharpness close-up shotsquiet quick auto-focus cons : heavy bulky ( this should expected these types lenses)distant subjects come out soft	-1

i bought sd110 camera , since i live hawaii , i underwater housing it . this housing great , because it allows you use all function buttons while camera protected housing . you power up camera , shoot , zoom , change modes everything but change battery , change memory card upload your pics onto computer while camera sealed up . i able take lots lots underwater surf pictures movies this camera . i very happy results . i treat my gear pretty rough , i water almost every day , not cleaning it all time although housing get scratched little banged up , it still worked great , it didn't affect quality my photos . then one day while rescuing swimmer distress , camera knocked off my kayak into ocean . i went back few minutes later search it . but unable find it .... i really bummed . four months later , friend friend diving same area i lost camera , saw something wedged reef , encrusted coral alge . he pulled it out took it back up boat-it digital camera housing . when he opened up housing took out camera ..... it powered right up !!!! so he took few shots boat then took camera home . he showed it his friend , they flipped through pictures he told him story finding it . one pictures i taken day i lost it , underwater self portrait . when my friend saw : he knew who camera it !!! so he calls me ... tells me story . i amazed . we figured camera housing lying bottom four months over twenty feet water , there few storms produced some very large surf area , so it likely taken beating . but it still maintained its water tight integrity . we all very amazed how durable it turned out !! i already replaced camera canon s500 it dedicated housing ( mostly so i could get higher resolution photos ) . after uploading photos onto my computer , i let guy who found it keep it . he cleaned up housing , it stays still water tight , only thing wrong it ( besides little surface crud exterior casing ) , few buttons jammed so they not work ( zoom , shutter power buttons fine ) . but not bad all camera bottom ocean several months	1

i spent lot time reading reviews posts , finally i bought it , it best camera i used , i went old konica 35mm film camera sony cybershot 2 mp then not camera while later i kodak p850 ( great camera also , but slow my taste ) finally this s9000 , belive me this great choice it only camera i found positivly compared dlsr still prosumer camera , tells lo t.t he lack picture stabilization not big deal , it anti blur mode which almost same , full array controls manual settings help please amateurs not so ameteurs . it also first steps os face detection it multifocus mode , which focuses most times subjects faces where ever they frame ( not necesary centered ) , i mention it its limitations you know how compose your sho t.t he user guide easy read , understand follow , you don't know nothing photografy this manul you use most functions few hours easy . summary : 5 5 !!! nice camera	1
good price 9mp camera 10x zoom . image quality good . i'm still shooting mainly 3mp 5mp good results . spot metering works really well , especially while shooting bright day objects sitting under umbrella . macro works nicely . i still yet find good use super macro . camera recycles shots pretty quick . anti-blur mode ( using higher iso rate ) works well . controls/menu make sense . although i wish memory switch feature not buried too deep menu . that good feature . you 2 memory cards camera xd so cheap . you combined capacity instead buy bigger more expensive card . i especially like how menu displayed even inside viewfinder ( it exact copy lcd ) . way , i don't take my eyes off my object while cycling through menu . i wish battery life could better . effort conserve battery power , i shoot mainly using viewfinder avoid using flash using anti-blur mode . but bright side , one just carry more high-capacity , rechargeable aa . it just takes while get used battery consumption rate . i carry 2 sets backups where third one alkaline	1
i like this camera very much easy use gets good result	1
i went taking camera out its packing taking professional quality pictures twenty minutes . it amazing	1
very important shade camera lenses avoid flairs . it doesn't fit carrier bag designed canon s2 , s3 , though , which big time bummer . however , i would recommend it anyways , because quality pictures protection your lenses worth carrying different bag rest your stuff	-1
what wonderful camera . photos come out sharp clear . small size makes it very handy carry around you all times . photos load very quickly computer . price i would rate this " best buy " . i found only one drawback which i feel minor . very bright sunlight it difficult see object screen unless it shaded hand or piece paper or cardboard . but this minor problem would not stop me purchasing second coolpix l4 . you purchase 512 or meg memory card very little money . check amazon kingston or sandisk . i both they great .	1
i simply love this camera , it very tiny size takes great pictures you buy rechargable batteries or regular batteries if you should choose . it simple use , didn't even read manuel . starter camera or advance user , get this one , you love it !!!	1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shaped one three quarters inch long offers limited protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . so shallow petal shaped , even this type protection limited . even if protection limited , replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 16-35mm f/ 2.8 ef normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . this lens isn't unusually wide so extra inch may not problem . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality reduces lens flare problems offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store lens	-1
this fabulous reliable camera . feels solid . fantastic pictures . easy operate . new d40 announced over past few days , but its lack lcd display buttons manage basic camera controls ( reduce weight make it more user friendly ) would still make this my recommended nikon dslr . expect prices fall d40 becomes available	1
i felt price very competitive it received within time frame seller told me it would . camera very easy handle so far taken wonderful shots . it just what i hoping it would	1
my first digicam , bought it 2 years ago . simple use , great pictures , year ago ( hundreds pictures ago ) i dropped it ( no its case ) cobblestone road - no damage . never seen need replace it . i like common batteries it uses sd memory	1
it works great my ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii lens . price this hood ring seems pricy compare lens price , but it job when it really needed .	-1
if you've bought sd550 , this great addition , case saved my camera couple times already scratches dings ( especially little kids around ) , extra camera chord long durable ( coated metal link chain ) extra battery course invaluable . i'd give it 5 stars , if i didn't feel these items should come standard camera . :	-1
i've my d2h 9 months now . i've heard magenta skin tones issue but never seen it .. skin tones my unit great . it seems this issue plagued minority users . camera very fast , exposes well delivers results . it primarily designed sports photojournalism camera -- situations where speed counts . it 4 megapixel wonder -- it true it only 4 megapixels , but they 4 great megapixels . images upsize wonderfully . i love my unit , am debating whether buy second one backup , or wait d2x . price d2x making decision bit easier i'm leaning toward d2h .	-1
don't mislead , this ab-so-lu-te-ly great product regardless if you big or small hands . it fits new rebel xti ( 400d ) too !! my hands small , but before bg-e3 grip i no real use fifth fourth fingers ( except tucking them underneath xt small body . ) bg-e3 , hand grip firm whole hand grabs camera . this gives you extra feeling pleasing assurance , not unnecessary sensation . better still , front panel bg-e3 rubberized so bottom half your hand won't slip away ( canon should covered camera own grip material instead using average plastic makes body mould . ) little extra weight not problem , rather it always comes handy counterbalance you zoom lenses ( say 300mm range ) . short , this accessory gives rebel camera user welcome feeling overall control sensation more professional gear your hand . extra slot second battery , course plus . i'm selling my xt soon new xti available , it nice know investment i made not long ago this grip , prove useful when i switch . now , if only future 40d ( who knows ) same compatibility ...	1
neccesary add cannon rebel . good product . too bad it doesn't come camera	1
i no investment dslr but narrowed my choices canon 30d nikon d200 . i always wanted nikon . d200 definitely joy hold it take good pictures ( i tried both camera store before i bought 30d ) . i lot research ( more than i care admit ! ) there no conclusive evidence one camera clear edge over other . depending your specific needs , one camera may " slightly better " than other . after trying out both cameras , i convinced 30d good fit my needs d200 . " value money " 30d clear winner over d200 ( i got mine when canon cash canon promotion going ) . also , beginner slr i found 30d its fully automatic scene modes easy start out . i don't expect use scene modes or full auto mode after week or two . i expect quickly graduate creative control zones . but use family camera , quick scene modes very helpful . if you expect use it more professional basis it'd probably not matter . additionally , when i checked it out store , i noticed canon 30d focused sharply almost every time . d200 not least few times . i'd take this grain salt though since it brief trial store . but i thought i'd share my experience . it may just anomaly actual equipment i tried out . i still find nikon d200 great camera ? absolutely ! i regret bought canon 30d ? absolutely not ! decision swinger my case really " money factor " . i more than willing spend up $300 more nikon d200 . but when difference became $550 it no longer became justifiable my christmas gift myself :-) my purchases included canon 30d [ ... ] , canon 17-85mm ef-s usm lens [ ... ] , sandisk extreme iii 2gb compact flash card [ ... ] i plan add external flash this soon , consider eventual lenses after i determine camera long-term keeper .	1
this camera incredible . i ordered it my husbands birthday he just begining figure it all out . there so many great features . one best how quickly you take digital pictures . our other digital cameras lag time shots , but not this one . pictures crisp it easy even novice like me use . i highly recommend this camera if you want take digital photography next level . it one best	1
this great purchase $150 . i bought it shoot amateur pictures family youth football games . images sharp across football field sunny day , i use canon monopod recommend it . it 75-300mm so i switch out lenses take pictures people standing close me . there 28-200mm lens but it much more expensive i like extra zoom	-1
exceptional portrait lens both digital film , nikkor 85mm f/ 1.8 usably sharp wide open tack sharp time you stop down even just bit . relatively small very light , it feels just right my hand . steve mccurry one my favorite photographers i happy discover many his great shots taken this lens . also , if you shoot manual focus body like f3 , you'll like solid but smooth feel focus ring . 85mm comes metal , screw-on hood . my preference plastic bayonet mounts , but i find i don't need hood often since this lens doesn't tend flare . two minor complaints this lens : first , bokeh not exceptional . that ok ; i'm not bokeh hound . but when i see creamy out focus specular highlights 85mm f/ 1.4 produces , sometimes i dream spending extra money . second , i wish it af-s . but even without af-s , it focuses faster than you'd expect . finally , construction solid . i've used it heavily two years deserts , jungles , glaciers ( ok , less glamorous places like around apartment ) it still looks brand new . short , my favorite lens . absolutely worth every penny	1
if you don't need speed or can't afford expensive 85mm 1.4 nikkor lens or both , then this lens may right one you . it took nikon while produce superb compact 85mm lens , but this time they finally got it right . without doubt , this fine portrait lens photographing head-and-shoulder portraits ( only lens which optically better nikon legendary 105mm 2.5 nikkor lens , its close optical twin , 105mm 2.8 micro nikkor . ) . since 105mm 2.5 nikkor lens doesn't autofocus version , then this might perfect moderate telephoto lens owners nikon autofocus slr cameras . regardless , this lens well-earned reputation excellent contrast resolution	1
could not any simpler use . used it few times since it arrived it works flawlessly . +++ recommended all users . quicker easier than built charger zr700 camcorder	1
first i not this lens yet but i am buying it . it reportedly excellent lens very little distortion edges ( which why i'm buying it ) . i update this review after i lens , however , i feel people should warned big error well received review because it only lead frustration . not listen john kwok suggestion buy canon 60mm macro lens unless you you own 20d , 300d , or 350d/rebel xt . lens ef-s lens september , 2005 it only fit those cameras - it not optimized all canon dslr he states . other hand , 50mm macro here fit all canon 35mm film cameras all digital slr .	1

like most every canon accessory , 580ex well made very expensive . i cheaped out when i bought my digital rebel bought sigma ef-500 dg , which represented " almost good " canon 580ex . appears true . problem " almost " leaves me no master/slave lighting . so when i picked up eos 30d , i bit bullet paid big bucks canon . it works advertised nicely makes sigma slave it really born	1
580ex wonderful flash i would not hesitate buy it again . fact i might even buy second one . there however couple issues you should aware . 1 . battery compartment door takes little getting used . you may feel like you going snap it off first . not really big deal though . 2 . ( my opinion this big deal ) . `auto focus assist ' completely useless . its just led pointed through rather bad `lens ' . it won't anything past couple feet . laser diode diffraction grating would made it work far past useable flash distance this price canon should know better . all told however it wonderful flash . circular command dial make adjusting flash exposure easy ( dial more or less flash relative ambient light ) . if you not external flash get one . it makes huge difference . this great offering .	-1
i love this camera ! i bought it keep my diaper bag so i always camera me . it small , easy use takes great pictures . i recently sent few them developed they came out great . only recommendation i purchase larger memory card - one it comes only hold few pictures	1
i bought this camera $249 new which marked down $499 retail . this older model new models just come out . money this good camera , but i am very particular not blown away . images good , but i expecting more vibrance . colors bit weak . it not take focused shot indoors unless flash , flash way bright closer shots . image often over exposed , i find myself placing piece paper over flash get more correct shot . i upgraded canon a40 2 megapixel camera ( amazing camera ! ) , images very similar quality , except new sd500 captures them bigger , 7 megapixel chip , hence little better detail . i like small size , battery lasts long time charges . holds lots pictures 1 gig card i purchased seperatly . video quality quite good still camera .	-1
i not take more than one bags . this bag big enough everything .	1
i bought this bag use my canon elura 100 camcorder . camcorder these days small camera , but i knew i'd need lot room accessories this bag fit bill . i this bag right now : camcorder , 5 minidv tapes , extra battery , head cleaner , extra wide angle lens , external mic , l-bracket mounting mic , lens cleaning kit , remote control , all wires , lens filters . i still room quite bit more ! what i love this bag it really big bag doesn't all feel like big bag - that great thing me ! inside super configurable which great ' cause you set it up way best accessories you so everything fits , but doesn't move around . this same bag cost almost double best buy other retail stores so it steal here amazon ! i love it	1
question : canon s2 only 1 color - silver . i believe this telephoto converter came only black , doesn't it look silly silver camera long black nose ? i going get this adaptor but i am holding back because it color . instead , i am looking find adaptor converter kit comes silver instead black . although i don't this converter . assuming i am satisfied its quality featuers , i would only give it only 4.5 stars because it color . anyone any ideas	-1

what great little piece kit . it great my ef 70-200mm f/4l . only drawback you've no af . you forced use manual focus . now this isn't big problem , unless you're photographing wildlife or moving objects . well worth price though very useful	-1
this product works really well , price great . i am always pleased quality kodak	-1
i am new slrs i cant belive how good this camera . this camera worth every penny amazing quality it produces . i always thot my old digital pics point shoot excellent , but looking back , they look terrible compared this .	1
when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
i bought remote control so i could trip shutter while my camera tripod . mostly landscape stuff . it works great my intended use . only minor problem you point remote control front camera . i found it works fine if i hold remote front , below lens ( out view lens )	-1
i bought this remote canon digital rebel xt . pretty much programs itself . great asset it clips camera strap . works good distance . highly recommen	1
wonderful camera . very flexiable , very versitile . most wonderful creation device someone whom capable . def good buy now 30d out . i've this camera over year i still love it	1
this camera amazing , i couldn't asked more . just warned manual pretty terrible . it best just play around camera until you figure it out , rather than wasting time trying decipher manual	1
walkaround lens . this very topic leads heated discussion among dslr photographers . first , determine your budget , focal length , aperture needs . if you frequently find yourself zooming out get everything frame , you want wide angle lens such this . if you frequently find yourself zooming , this not lens you . full frame body such canon eos 5d , this lens becomes ultra wide angle . aps-c crop body such digital rebel xti ( which i used this review ) , it becomes medium wide angle . but thanks 1.6 crop factor , this lens expands more usable 35mm equivalent focal length 27 64mm . second , audition lens if you . definition , walkaround lens should relatively portable . 1.1 lbs ., canon ef 17-40mm f/4l usm neither super light nor neck breakingly heavy . fact , it weighs almost same digital rebel xti -- really nice balance . lens feels very solid supreme build quality only l-series lenses offer . although this lens weather proof therefore sealed against liquid dust , i strongly recommend getting 77mm filter protect front lens element . it , this lens made last . terms looks feel , it doesn't get much better . its rubberized full-time inner focus manual ring usm focuses smoothly , quietly , quickly . since it inner focus , lens not extend beyond its metal casing whether you zoom or out . focus window shows focusing distance 0.28 meter ( 0.92 feet ) infinity . focal length marker indicates 17 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 35 , 40mm . lens exudes quality tip tip . you may tolerate heavier lens or may not mind lesser build quality cheaper lenses . walkaround lens used very often , so make sure you comfortable i t.t his lens famous saturated color deep contrast . its images simply stunning . 17mm wide angle , barrel distortion noticeable but relatively mild . 24mm 40mm , its images distortion free perfectly suited capturing people . vignetting ( corner darkness ) minimal mild chroma abberrations ( color shadows ) . f/4 aperture , details become noticeably softer toward edges . center region very sharp f/ 5.6 , edges remain fairy sharp . thanks 7 diaphragm blades , this lens produce very nice bokeh 40mm ( blur effects ) . one most cited weaknesses f/4 aperture . my experience , bump iso speed steady hands all you need take well focused images indoor . other hand , if you shooting very little amount light , you might wish f/ 2.8 or image stabilizer . although difference f/4 f/ 2.8 just 1 stop , my other lens , canon ef 24-70mm f/ 2.8 usm ( too heavy my walkaround lens ) easily outperforms such challenging situations . but large , i not handicapped f/4 aperture . some main competitions ( sorted price ): - sigma 18-50mm f/ 2.8 ex dc : arguably best wide angle lens limited budget . focus mechanism bit slow , corner very soft , chroma abberrations bit issue , lens highly prone flare . works only ef-s mount . - sigma af 17-70mm f/ 2.8 - 4.5 dc macro : bit more expensive than sigma 18-50mm , but wider focal range macro capability . - canon ef-s 17-85mm f/4- 5.6 usm : this " traveler lens " wider focal range than most wide angle lenses ( widest among canon ) equipped image stabilizer . but lens famous extreme barrel distortion 17mm chroma abberrations . works only ef-s mount . - tamron sp af 17-50mm f/ 2.8 di ii ld aspherical ( if ): this most direct competitor . it takes sharper images faster aperture while costing less . both build focus mechanism significantly worse , but should good enough many . works only ef-s mount . - canon ef-s 17-55mm f/ 2.8 usm : this reference , if you afford it . its images razor sharp details great performance all around ( minus vignetting , which typical ef-s lenses ) . build quality worse than l-series but not too shabby . works only ef-s mount . this best ef-s lens hands down . - canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 usm : one most expensive wide angle zoom lenses . it larger heavier , but f/ 2.8 aperture . this how canon ef 17-40mm f/4 usm stacks up . pros : - among very best build quality . - excellent , buttery smooth , super fast front-focus system . - top notch color contrast . very sharp center resolution . - almost non-existent vignetting , generally low distortion , well controlled chroma abberrations . - ideal weight size walkaround purposecons : - edge softness f/4 aperture . - narrower focal length than most competing lenses . - slower than some third party lenses . all all , this excellent wide angle walkaround lens . it may not offer most bang buck , but if you value full frame compatibility ( ef lens mount ) excellent build quality , this default choice . this lens comes nice pouch lens hood . i find hood somewhat ridiculously shaped because lens resistant flare , i not use it often when shooting outdoor	1
this magnificent lens deserving high praise . general , i tend shoot " available light " towards wide angle , ef 17-40 f4l one perfect lens someone like me . aps size sensor camera ( mine rebel xt ) , it works approximately like 28-70 mm zoom -- perfect walk-around lens , giving you decent wide angle tele end , pleasing perspective faces you expect moderate telephoto . i spent two weeks ef 17-40 coast shooting nature street stuff small towns . it performed perfectly . but i only realized what real treasure i when i began second thoughts it eve long overseas journey . i asked myself whether i would not better buying ef-s 17-85 f4- 5.6 . after all , it gives you better reach - equivalent 28-135 mm zoom 35 mm camera . would it not perfect lens overseas trip ? dilemma worhty hamlet . so i decided order it amazon while i still time return ef 17-40 . soon ef-s 17-85 came , i some tests taking pictures still life , flowers portrait similar focal lengths full zoom . results put 17-85 shame . color light flat paled next 17-40 . but there still problem reach . i took portrait full zoom same person ( 40 mm or 65 mm equivalent 85 mm or 135 equivalent ) , cut out critical focus area both pix equalized two crops terms pixel numbers . unprocessed , 17-85 produced perfectly focused picture , 17-40 crop visibly softer , but terms tonality richness gradations , it way ahead its rival . photoshop rescue ! after i fiddled sharpening contrast cs2 , focus softness 17-40 gone , result better all-around picture same portrait detail . other words , if you wish take picture , say , building detail or monkey mug shot zoo -- situation calling telephoto 135 mm 17-85 capable -- ef 17-40 f4 job , fact better job terms textures tonality -- focus , too , if you little post-processing sc2 . i am returning ef-s 17-85 stick ef 17-40 , taking it my overseas trip . unlike ef-s 17-85 f4- 5.6 , which feels like decent consumer zoom , ef 17-40 f4l built like tank weather sealing . it should also come handy if when i decide switch full-frame camera ( ef-s lenses work only aps-size sensors ) .	1
i would not able imagine shooting without sb-800 , it just so integral my photography . my only gripe ttl preflashes which cause some people blink half-blink time main flash goes off . but you easily get around this using fv lock . fill flash perhaps most excellent function sb-800 . i usually stop it down - 1.3 ev - 1.7 ev get imperceptable results	1
bought it together d50 , 6 month ago . simply best choice digital nikon slr , superior compared high-end flashes analog nikon cameras . within range up 60feet this flash brighten very smooth , no red eyes , press focus perfectly . but you need 5th battery , you better spent money high-end batteries , don't use " consumer-type " rechargeable ones . they last very short time only , not enough fill 1gb card !	1
nice intermediate level flash , works great within its perameters	-1
all my life i seen myself especially babies some reason victim redeye . i bought this right before my son born taken nothing but beautiful pictures ever since haven't single red eye no matter how light someone eyes . great benefit/feature able bounce flash off ceiling or wall avoid ghost face ( go devil eye ) it takes beautiful pictures even dimly lit rooms without smidge graininess . ( see one two pictures my son indoors customer images this product ) we use this canon digital rebel xt	1
i get frustrated all negative reviews this lens gets web . yes , af slow first generation . yes , it not totally sharp it slow long end . but what other $440 ( inc shipping ) 300mm lenses there ? * costs $1100 shorter but heavier optics not much better . * 100-400l costs $1400 , much larger just slow . * 70-200/4l 50% more expensive , only 200mm lacks . * new 70-300 replaces this lens probably better lens than this version but it costs 50% more currently ( oct 05 ) still not available us . 75-300mm my zoo lens so i don't use it nearly much my standard zoom everyday photography . my digital rebel its 1.6 crop factor this lens equivalent 120-480mm 35mm terms , image stabilization feature it makes some exotic optics . play this lens ' strengths ( middle aperture range [ don't afraid higher iso settings achieve this ] not extreme long end ) your images able printed 8x10 without issue . you're not going able easily track speeding cheetah this lens but not what this lens . it also unfair compare this lens series alternatives - if you afford series lenses then use them but don't cut those us down without your disposable income just enjoying this lens . if you own this lens you want improve quality your images remember always use lens hood . also , amazing but there limits ; monopod improve image sharpness no end . but both these tips apply equally most lenses both cheaper more expensive . this lens earned permanent place my camera bag . it cheap enough light enough carry just case you might need strong telephoto . really works really useful telephoto this kind zoom range . don't put off or intimidated lens snobs line counters . this lens also holds its value well ; buy it , use it , now while you're saving your dream telephoto you able sell it not much less than you paid it when time comes upgrade . when time comes you just might decide you want keep 75-300mm around well . this lens great value very useable even if it not great lens .	-1
i cannot help but giggle when i saw comments like " great lens money " . it selling $440 here , even so-called clearance . however , one easily find same lens least $50 cheaper some decent online camera store , such bh , ritz camera , etc . sad amazon ..	-1
you know , i researched this lens again again . i put it my christmas list . year half went i finally just bought it . my gosh , everything true ! this one world great lenses . what piece glass . image stabilization i take candid shots candlelit restaurant using available ligh t.t he lens magical . it captures soul its subjects . nature photography phenomenal . this incredible tool take you new level . just it ! no regrets . honest .	1
best camera i've ever owned . it features found larger slr such shutter speed red-eye reduction . several shoot modes such portrait allows close ups well scenery mode which allows sharp vivid photos foilage well sunsets . marvelous little camera size slightly bigger than pack cigarettes allows you take this anywhere without bulk some slr their required lens . too many features list here . try one yourself you'll amazed	-1
i bought this camera my 10 year old daughter . she thrilled her own camera taken may vacation pics family . i would reccommend all beginning photographers . great price range all options . plus easy use	-1
lens fulfilled all our expectations quality portraits field view flexibility . stabilization aspect great help , although it doesn't compensate someone pushing shutter too fast low light conditions . highly recommend this lens standard use lens canon rebel xt	1
this lens very versatile , offering good wide angle good head-and-shoulders portrait length . it internal focusing , which helps speed close-focusing performance , image stabilizer better low-light performance . particular benefit those shoot darker open areas , like wedding photographers churches . , combined flash , allow use get more background detail indoor events . no longer we accept dark , dungeon like backgrounds ! ideally , lens would little bit brighter ( say , f4 top end ) , bit heavier built . but then again , we could $ 1,000 more	-1
i bought 2 these carry camera support suspended over treadmill filming above . i love fact they extend 70 " . they very sturdy hook central post i could hang sandbag additional support . furthermore , support beams each leg central post attached central ring tighten change size base support measured distance legs tripod . this extremely helpful when you limited floor space tight or cramped corners . addition sandbags , this narrow base support still quite stable . additional bubble levels stand enormously helpful rough terrain . locking mechanims legs plastic , however thus not very good outdoor , dusty conditions . they very much like samsonite 3751 same camera release mechanism , locking legs , bubble levels , extendable center post , changeable size base suppor t--t he differences : cheaper , greater extension , hook center post , carrying case	1
i little hesitant purchase this tripod because low price . last cheap tripod i bought lightweight wobbly . i am very pleased performance this tripod . i wasn't expecting bogen type quality , but its good enough . it lightweight , surprisingly sturdy . i would recommend this tripod friend	1
okay , lot said saving money , however there problems no-name or non-branded products . no matter what your " style " photography , you battery empty its charge critical moment . back-up essential . quality back-up battery get you through imperative . knock-off brands not hold same charge branded battery meant your camera ; although their manufacture may claim it . get zone get shot !	1
this excellent battery powers my canon 5d camera very well . although i haven't tested it against spec how many shots i get it , i've very impressed longevity it charge	1
i know it sounds too good true , i've read too many reviews where people say " i never knew how i ever took pictures without this grip , " but it truth . first thing i noticed vertical handle , it amazing . you shoot vertical shots one hand ! all buttons you need grip , shutter button , wheel , two buttons top right xt . installation , it joke , don't even read manual . you charge batteries , but mean time you put your regular canon battery , or 6 aas because this comes aa shell . think it this way , xt baby ... it easy hold if you small hands ; i don't , i knew camera small , i decided buy this really so i could better handle it , extra battery life whipping cake . i really don't know how i could stand hold camera without this grip . don't spend extra money canon model , this one perfect	1
i read rave reviews opteka battery grip manufactured same specs canon grip but fraction price , so i knew i couldn't go wrong it . it came two 3rd party batteries well only $20 more , so what i lose ? let me start off saying i experience 3rd party batteries they usually waste money they horrible performance standpoint . not these however , i taken few hundred pictures 20% flash battery meter still full . great value overall . grip really balance out small size rebel xt always stays my camera . it add considerable weight camera however , but nothing overbearing	1
i lens , i cap .... its so long since i bought both i don't remember if cap came lens or not . surely it !!!!!!! i love my add lenses but i say now i've added all these other toys ( macro , wide angle , telephoto , filters ) i now realize i shouldve gotten slr digital held out true lenses instead conversion option . i love my s2is but just think how nice real camera would !!!!!! sigh ...	1
i'd stating obvious preaching choir if i said care lenses slr cameras required decent lens cap . this one snaps into 58mm threads end many lenses ( canon otherwise ) , so just sure confirm it proper size your lens	-1
i am very pleased this item . size right , resolution photos perfect . i am enjoying using camera	1
i almost didn't buy this camera simply because plastic body ( i'm used praktica mtl3 film camera , which built like tank ) . however , i'm glad i overlooked because camera top-notch terms robust features quality it provides . startup time very quick making adjustments shutter speed aperture intuitive . if you get bundle kit lens , i highly recommend complimenting it very affordable canon ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii lens , especially if you big fan dof lot available-light / low-light photography .	1
i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	-1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
i gave this monopod my boyfriend , gift , it perfect his use . he videotapes his kids baseball softball games , tired holding camcorder so long . he didn't want deal bulky tripod when he getting up down , so monopod seemed like great idea . he loved it !! he says it keeps camera very steady it very easy change height so he use it sitting or standing . he no professional , but he uses his camcorder lot , he'll happily using monopod long time	1
i love this monopod ! i'm person who uses my camera nearly every day ( canon eos elan 7 35mm ) . this item one my favorite accessories camera -- so much easier travel than tripod ! it sturdy , but lightweight , easy use very portable . i am mostly using monopod support my camera enormous , extremely heavy 500mm telephoto lens attached . i'm actually able hold huge lens steady just monopod -- not one blurry photo ! i've dragged it all over bluegrass kentucky ... across fields horse farms , even racetrack . i've taken it out into wilderness photograph elk . i keep closing it down extending it out every time we got out vehicle , which often . also recently traveled all over arizona it grand canyon , monument valley , canyon de chelley , etc . i constantly opening closing it , taking literally hundreds photos ( 14 rolls ) no problems all . i'm wondering if other reviewer just got defective one . i wish i'd bought one these years ago ! i highly recommend it	1
i forgot my wife birthday she subsequently hinted she wanted telephoto lens ... i started looking cheap ones , but decided , i might well it right if i going it all . when it arrived , my wife took it out box we both stunned how massive this lense . it heavier than you might think well ( which means mounting ring come packaged this lens absolute god-send ) . first thing we go out buy mono-pod it . next we took it camping then water-skiing ended up some most incredible , crystal clear shots we've ever seen . autofocus incredibly fast - i able hold down button snap through multiple exposures while speeding across waves . most time - thing right . we then mounted it tri-pod shot family portraits . this first time we all kids grandkids together six years once again - lens didn't let us down photos fantastic . i don't any real training camera ( i use cannon rebel auto-focus most time ) but this lens worth every dime . ... it also worked get me out dog-house my wife ..	1
i keep it short sweet . very sharp - quick autofocus . i use it my canon 20d .	1
it performs you'd expect . bar holds paper place , cutter cuts paper . i also got perforating scoring blades , those also work very well . using cutter perforator , i've made several custom-size notebooks tear-out pages	1
when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i'd always loyal film . digital could never take place film . i'm not convinced it replaced film completely . there still something i love putting roll film camera , shooting away , sending film processed , seeing results . i also know it bit expensive . i know argument quality always paramount discussion , but digital cameras improving this regard , most manufacturers assuring users while technology always improving , we point where good investment made digital slr it not outdated soon buyer purchases camera . so i figured now time get digital slr . i loyal nikon user nearly ten years , owned nikon n60 , n70 , n80 . my first love , still n70 ( i've told person who sold me camera he thought i only person who loved n70 ) . i purchased n80 only after my n70 cost too much repair , but i've enjoyed way my various nikon cameras handled all sorts situations fact they simple use point shoot if i don't time use specific controls , but it also options more creative artistic purposes . my nikon cameras allowed me capture family moments ease majestic landscapes , wildlife shots all sorts other things i can't resist capture forever . i decided purchase d70 since it close what i've already experienced nikon . many ways it works similar way n70 80 , except it digital rather than film version . like film versions midrange nikon slr , it dial allows automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , night portrait modes , ability select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . camera auto manual focus abilities . photos easy or technical photographer desires . controls easy use , though it takes practice comfortable . personal level , camera passed halloween test , niece birthday test , fall foliage new england test favorite scenic spots test . only real difficulty i've camera trying capture stained glass windows dark setting . auto focus not worked all i'm not thrilled manual focus these shots , but this point i'm sure it photographer not camera . i one suggestion anyone who purchases this camera . manual very confusing . it uses all sorts symbols more distraction than anything else . i've luck " magic lantern guides " my other cameras , but not yet used it this camera . i purchase nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which helpful . it quick reference anyone already familiar nikon photography general but it also provides introduction novice photography .	1
i weddings , portrait , outdoor photography i don't see any reason why i'd ever switch d70 ( other than d80 :) . this camera professional grade consumer price point . don't scared 6.1 mp . i print 20x30 all time w/ out any problems . i'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1
it learning curve , that sure , but wow ! this camera worht every penny , far more stable then comparable canon rebel , product comes better lenses . quality glass matter	1
i just attached my battery grip my 300d first time today , difference amazing . i already extra battery pack , so i charged them both up slid them right away . added weight very nice addition 300d small body , i already see improvement my ability hold camera still . it also makes camera feel much sturdier . i seen few reviews complain fitting . i not problem . connection seemless me , there no shimmy what-so-ever when i 70-300 lens attached camera tripod . so maybe this accessory optimized xt ? i love extra shutter button well , it makes taking picture portrait orientation extremely comfortable easy . buttom almost exactly same actual shutter camera well , which makes it easy go button button . after reading all hype this accessory , i forced myself buy it , i not dissapointed ! i recommend it anyone using xt . buy it now or else	1
recycle times fantastic . batteries seem last forever . much less expensive than alternatives	1
i'm using cpe3 my 20d 580ez . i'm shooting over 500 wedding flash shots before i notice any slow down recyle time . recycle 3 seconds after full discharge hardley noticeable anything less . i am using " digital " brand 2200 mah ni-mh batteries . pack uses 8 batteries recharge flash capicitor while 4 batteries flash running flash electronics . i am very happy this combination . way i'm using stroboframe pro-rl flash bracket it great . battery pack cpe3 straps right bracket	-1
i love ef 70-200 f/4l usm telephoto zoom lens . price right , super quality pictures color contrast . it light weight 1.5 pounds comparing its siblings , 70-200 f/ 2.8 or without ( 3.5 pounds ) . i am think buy new model 70-200 f/4l . , i take pictures lower light conditions , which i could not it my 70-200 f/4l .	1
this great lens , amazingly sharp . only thing i would say if i money 2.8 version would even better certainly something i'll consider upgrade future . use fast shutter speed or mono/tripod this thing . anything below 250/sec gets problem 200mm	1
i agree previous review . deluxe blower brush just left more dirt camera because hair brush falling out	-1
this lens great . i've doing portraits just random snapshots it makes every picture beautiful ! only downside lack ability zoom . other than it great lens	-1
this awesome lense , especially money . i would still purchase this one . there nothing second rate it . however , canon new series version their website photo . it 50 mm normal ef f/ 1.2 usm 1599 . 00 . i heard photographers who shoot whole weddings this one 3 hundred dollar lens 50mm lens .	1
sure , this isn't pro mono pod it doesn't mobile head but money it great . easily holds my olympus e1 50-200mm lens . great walking stick well . stores tight light . highly recommend this product . i may just get back up	-1
mp100 served us well since getting it 2 months ago . like other reviewers , i wasn't expected whole lot after disappointed $40 monopod made those well under 6 feet tall . quite stable , usable walking stick , easier reset height than competition under $50 twist-lock legs . this monopod definitely exceeded my expectations ! seems niche here higher priced version pan/tilt head , but i 30yr old leica table top tripod pan/tilt head combination works great ! balance , can't beat even if all you order mp100 pay $6 or so s/h ! use beach or where dirt grit air , you'll want wipe down legs before collapsing ( cloth used gun storage work great ) or you may grit legs scratching mp100 legs subsequent use .	1
great affordable camera , takes very nice pictures .	1
bought p880 month ago . i am sem-pro outdoor adventure photographer i use nikon 35mm film equipment most part . i shoot slide film my f90s nikon . i 5mp kodak digital camera but wanted upgrade better digital camera but i could not justify buying nikon d50 or d70s they only 6mp . i didn't want drop 2 grand d200 . so i looked mid-range camera lines . after doing much research , i decided buy this camera . so far i am happy i . i taken it hiking several times , enough i know its good camera but course its toy compared pro nikon film cameras . but i knew when i bought it . i wanted good camera take lots " documentary " , " fun " " travel " shots . really powerful stuff i still shoot slide film . but its too expensive shoot extensively!here my initial impressions based perspective outdoor photosgrapher : good : 1 ) fairly easy hold its tall actual grip . 2 ) lightweight ( but course expense impact resistance i'm sure ... ) 3 ) great set manual controls ! this best part . autobracket good interval timer which great self-potraits . you walk far away camera get yourself shot ( great solo hikers ) . 4 ) large 2.5 " lcd makes it easy check out your photos5 ) image quality seems pretty good ( although not comparable high-res . scan slide ) . 6 ) manual zoom great ! much better than power zooms almost all other cameras . 7 ) 24mm focal length simply amazing ! great landscapes outdoor adventure shots . 8 ) battery life great . shot 250 or so pics full charge included lot playing around menus , reviewing photos , etc . i just boughta second kodak battery amazon $16 ! 9 ) built flash pretty powerful you add shoe mount unit well . 10 ) 8mp resolution price 6mp camera . not so good : 1 ) seems write card pretty slowly . definately not action shots ! maybe this would improve if i bought faster sd card . 2 ) " toggle " button back navigating through menues worries me . seems like it could break someday . i am gentle it . wish they would create more durable feeling toggle . 3 ) lcd viewfinder hard see bright sunny day . this where film camera way better . optical viewfinders cannot beat . 4 ) screen manual focus no good all . better just focus your eyes . 5 ) wish they would made handgrip little grippier adding rubber stip or like . little slippery hands ( always use neck strap ! )in all i highly recommend this camera . if they improve upon some items which i some critisism , i would easily give this camera perfect review !! good luck your purchas	-1
i got this lens shooting architecture distance -- unsual application . i've also found myself using it shoot kids soccer games . it super sharp very fast focusing . i haven't formal tests all apertures , but images appear vivid contrasty range settings . online reviews rank this lens very highly my own experience supports those findings . image stabilization seems work very well , although sure turn it off if you're using tripod--i've found it reduce image quality if you forget turn it off application . shots where you'll standing around lot lens your eye , ready shot , it gets kind heavy carry . if you're shooting sports , you might want consider monopod . other applications , its weight low enough not too big problem . it comes canvas-like case includes loop you use attach it your belt . i've found this works pretty well out field , particularly when combined photo-vest . case also carried neck strap , but this gets way your camera strap also thin , so it kind cuts into your shoulder . i write this , amazon site link 58mm filters this lens . it takes 77mm filters	1
this battery backwards compatible d50 , d70/70s , used d80 d200 . so if you any nikon dslr want second battery , you want get this one so when you upgrade your camera you use battery . this battery built-in circuitry tells you actual charge status battery , it accurate . this big deal ; * if you using d200 or d80 * it lets you know when your really need switch batteries or charge up . this first battery i've seen accurate this regard . kudos nikon . ( this feature not work d50/70/70s but battery otherwise works fine )	1
i owned canon 10d but could never get used " cropped " view limited sensor . i barely used camera over 3 yrs ownership , preferring shoot my film nikon . 5d , full field view back . " sweep " one feel framing picture through this camera just marvelous . images ( " " lenses ) just stupendous . arguably better than film . this first camera less than $6000.00 every bit good film . i highly recommend it if you serious amatuer or professional photographer	1
if you've considering digital full frame camera ( who hasn't ? ) this one doesn't cost arm leg . now kodak out picture , your choices eos 5d or 1ds mark ii , which costs more than twice much . you give up few things , such super-fast frame rate continuous shooting , but 5d resolution you need top-quality images , ability get true wide angle perspectives your ef lenses . i happened shoot this camera concert side-by-side vendor " " camera , both under available light 85mm f/ 1.8 lenses range isos . i found some shots i liked other camera , shot iso 400 , comparable shots 5d which , my surprise , turned out exposed iso 3200 . 5d absolutely lives up its low noise reputation . but don't take my word it , try one out yourself	1
just got 5d .. traded my 20d ... 5d more solid camera full frame sensor ... pictures great it easy use if you familiar canon system ... little pricey , but worth it !! you'll use it years	1
price , this excellent lens . aps sized sensor it equivalent 480mm long end . some complain it slow lense since max aperture full zoom 5.6 just means you can't use it low light expect great results . if you want fast lense length , however , prepared pay lot money . usm it focuses very fast . works well outdoor sports . my rating based what you get money . course it not good glass but it way less money	1
there no professionals or would-be professional photographers our house . instead we ametuers who love get fun shots our friends family . we're not particularly interested birds , flowers , bugs , race cars , etc . we want catch our kids doing what they love best ; football , basketball , swimming , band , golf ... my only advantage i am very experienced adobe photoshop , which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots . this year our son high-school senior . instead buying expensive portrait package , we voted spend money canon digital rebel xt kit ( lens ) . we choose one extra zoom lense ( 75-300mm f4- 5.6 iii usm telephoto ) up-close action sports shots . we didn't chose lens because it out our price range . we great fun this camera lens . we already taken variety football game pictures using ' basic ' sports setting camera ( burst mode full zoom ) . they great - crisp clear . these taken full sun . we realize we'll get little more creative when we taking pictures lower light situations . but i think we it . i would recommend this lens anyone who just wants capture some fun shots . they might not professional quality , but they just what we wanted	1
i recently purchased this lens 24-105mm part fall cash cannon rebate program . so , originally , my main reason get this lens because it would save me $50 off other lens via doubling rebates make it pretty cheap . but now i used it awhile , i am really happy i got it . 1.8 maximum aperture two things really well , lets you take low-light handheld shots isolates subject . see my example photos examples both these features . i use this canon rebel xt rebel xti which 1.6 crop factor make this lens more like 135mm which good bad depending your usage . this lens produces very sharp results doesn't weigh much , so it easy carry around . if you already good range zoom lenses looking something just take really nice , sharp , handheld shots , consider this lens	1
i am really impressed results i get this lens . this my first usm lens 85mm new me . it serves me really well taking people pictures outside - fantastic background blur fast enough low light indoor close ups . full time manual focus handy too times . my tamron 17-50 , this lens great combo me	1
answer most likely yes ; since its price make it best value fast canon prime lens . but before you make $350 plunge here few useful things know how it used . keep mind i use this lens rebel xt ( 1.6 factor ) , which means it provides me angel view similar 135mm film cameras . sharpness : yes that one feature you count when buying this lens . this lens produces very sharp pictures . so much so it blow away your 18-55 kit lens ( if you one ) all other zoom lenses . exception l-series zooms . sharpness difference obvious even smallest prints ( 4 6 ) . if you can't envision such difference then consider this . sharpness viewed contrast edges different color objects . hence , sharper image greater contrast edges such groups color . this lens captures contrast such setting better than most other lenses . speed : this lens blazingly fast . such you opportunity shoot higher shutter speeds wide open ( remember inverse relation aperture shutter speed ) . more importantly you gain ability shoot low light situations ( concert example ) still maintain decent shutter speed handholding . here best part , if you're like most new people photography , you probably plan take self portraits . this lens give you ability , you able buy few clamp lights coupled 100-150w bulbs start shooting medium iso speeds wide open . angel view : assuming you using this lens 1.6 digital format consider you tight crop , more like 135mm lens film camera ( 1.6 *85 = 136 ) . what translate practical terms ? you stand 6-8 feet away your subject able cover their head shoulders landscape orientation . special effects : here two special effects you find useful this lens depth field compression . some degree or every lens offers depth field , which summarize only subject interest focus rest picture blurred . this lens unique it creates very shallow depth field which subject truly isolated whole scene . set aperture 1.8 focus correctly you achieve such results . more importantly lens quality such blur ( known bokeh ) outstanding there eight diaphragm blades control aperture opening vs . 5 or 6 many other lenses . compression , since camera telephoto it compress everything its sight closer together fit its sight . example , if you photographing person , their face look wider their nose look smaller or flatter . keep mind unlike some longer telephoto lenses ( 300mm example ) effect this lens subtle pleasant size build : its size weight perfect ! it balances my xt very nicely . so much so , i take pictures very low shutter speeds this combination ( though i don't find my self doing often this fast lens ) . all this translates comfort confidence when i am shooting this lens . build quality excellent , i find no inherit weakness design . if you plan photograph friends family then this lens . you take sharp pictures right kind effects portraits like compression beautiful bokeh . lens fast designed excellently maximum control comfort . you won't miss shot because shake slow shutter speeds even if you ( that big if ) you put its speed use dialing higher aperture . it only draw back it pretty tight angel view 1.6 factor slrs . i can't think any other prime non-l canon line up matches this lens ( other than possibly 50mm 1.4 ) . truly incredible value , buy it confidence ! ps . no means this review cover all merits this lens . name couple , lens offers precise auto focus low chromatic aberration . rather , i covered features most useful its intended purpose ; taking pictures people .	1
i bought this monopod after reading reviews here . it really light-weighted . i used it take pictures dance performace where tripod not possible . i able use slow shutter got great images . cons : i saw pro ( i knew he runs studio ) using similar monopod which black . so my only complain its non-black color . well i am not pro anyway .	1
fast delivery , great price . i would buy them again , thanks =	1
it works just like one comes camera . comes little plastic bag	-1
this essential part digital picture taking . can't download pictures your kodak camera onto computer without it . it should come standard your camera purchase , but if you misplaced yours , this one get . arrived promptly ordered value great	1
after reviewing my options purchase my new canon a540 we chose this case i'm glad i ! nice snug fit camera , extra compartments memory card batteries , no need strap , you already provided one camera .	1
i want protect my lens . while not most expensive , canon adequate what i nee	-1
works designed , performs well intended lens , construction plastic though	1
i received my 28-200 yesterday amazon . read customer reviews , i immediately put my rebel xt tripod ran two series comparison shots 28-200 my canon 28-135 . three shots each f-stops 5.6 , 11 , 20 , one set indoors iso 1600 other outdoors iso 200 . focal length 135 using same scenes each camera , highest jpeg setting . after shooting both series , i compared them fresh out camera , side side . results : 28-200 least sharp 28-135 both foreground background most instances . it visibly sharper iso 200 f-stops 5.6 20 , ( 28-135 took honors f-stop 10 ) , 20 , it visibly sharper both foreground background . 28-135 one-stop faster shutterwise . both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely photoshop . there vagaries autofocus different shooting conditions consider ; different test scenes conceivably produce different results . my conservative conclusion : 28-200 good it gets super-zoom your canon ( unless you going drop $2200 series 28-300 carry it ) , 28-135 no clear sharpness advantage . these lenses , its tradeoff --- extra 65 mm focal length ( 105 mm after 1.6 conversion ) versus image stabilization low-light shooting capability . both lenses focus quickly silently , both lenses produce usable shots .	-1
i found this lens resonable all around lens , although when it comes portaits or close-ups i would recomend canon 100mm f/ 2.8 macro . if your looking camera use it i would highly recomend canon 10d wow	-1
i needed more reach than 400mm gave my eos 1d , so i purchased canon 500mm f/4l three years ago . it incredibly sharp out corners f/4 . bird mammal portraits , you see every feather , every hair . lens light enough use wimberley sidekick . some claim able handhold it , but i think its eight-plus pound weight bit much . i carry mine long lens case backpack harness kinesis gear . this lens ' image stabilization works very well . i've used it tripod one-second shutter speeds good telephoto technique , gotten sharp , publishable images . eos 1d or 1ds , lens camera rain-proof mild storms . i also got mine through adorama , no problem delivery or post-sale advertising . if you buy one expensive long lens wildlife , choose this one .	1
after noting captions exceptional photographs appeared nature photography magazines often shot this lens , i began read reviews . based uniformly excellent reviews , i bought this lens spent two weeks this january florida everglades taking pictures birds . based upon my experience lens , i would rate this second sharpness contrast only 300 mm 2.8 canon series lens . lens handholdable short periods shoot birds flight , but it best suited use solid tripod wimberley tripod head allow tracking birds flight	1
i delighted quality pictures i get this lens . autofocus fast quiet , while manual focus very solid smooth . i'm finally taking pictures worthy jewelry my partner creates	1
this fantastic lens not only macro shots but portraits too . extra distance allows far more flexibility when out . tried both 50 , 60 100mm - i'm glad i went 100mm	1
i spend most my time photographer taking macro photographs flowers other small things nature . i chose this lens over canon 50mm macro 100mm macro two reasons : ( 1 ) it constructed higher quality ud glass , so it great color contrast , it incredibly sharp all f/stops , ( 2 ) 180mm , it allows you stay farther away your subjects still focus 1:1 . this makes it easier take photographs without disturbing your subjects it allows you smaller , more blurry area background so background doesn't compete subject attention . lens also comes tripod color , which allows you conveniently change vertical horizontal , it adds stability your lens better balanced your tripod . lens ultrasonic motor , so it fast quiet when focusing , though i highly recommend setting focus limiter 1.5 m-infinity when not shooting macro photography . it speed up time it takes lens focus . only drawback i find lens it constructed only 8 blade aperture diaphram . theoretically , higher number blades , it would allow more natural blurs , but i say i've never noticed problem my photographs	1
i am new slrs i cant belive how good this camera . this camera worth every penny amazing quality it produces . i always thot my old digital pics point shoot excellent , but looking back , they look terrible compared this .	1
it extremely easy use . hard figure out menu , but once there no problem . takes beautiful pictures . great action shots well . seldom find blurry photo it stabelizer built	1
i love , love , love this camera . if you teens house watchout !, they'll definitely want this camera . it easy use well worth money . when my camera arrived , i amazed how small compact it . i let my son check it out first within no time we both using it . i really love movie feature . you record anywhere everywhere sound excellent . my last camera only recorded , but didn't any sound . it nothing compared this sony . 8.1 mega pixels makes pictures come out great . my sons i love it . they record all time take numerous pictures . i also like it internal memory , so if you don't memory stick yet , you still take pictures . 2.5 inch screen perfect . it makes it so easy get good shot all time . i no problems this purchase all . only thing i would recommend sony make something would protect 2.5 inch screen getting scratches , just like they optical lens . it always closed covered when its not use . but besides small detail there , sony great investment . i definitely buy sony again , especially when i decide update or if i'm looking gift give .	1
i bought this camera several weeks ago test-driven it forest preserves chicago upper michigan . it terrific job . i am artist who studied film school yet never used digital camera . i wanted something kind point shoot slr . i wanted some manual functions fool around , yet i also wanted easy shot family photos such . i didn't want start my digital experience expensive slr , so this proved great buy me . it very small compact yet very powerful .	1
unlike some other reviewers , i've no problems this battery ... i've it over year . i'm pro photographer , so it recharged over over over still holds charge . maybe it better because i tend totally drain my batteries before recharging ? i also use this battery dual battery grip alongside canon other off brand batteries	1
super lightweight , sharp wide open , short minimum focus distance , fast af . decent bokeh . ability take pictures very low light , super cheap when compared it 35mm 1.4 $1000+ brother 1.6 digital its normal lens see some shots : http://www.pbase.com/2bruce/gillin	1
this set basic filters must every camera bag ... even new slr users find them easy use they enhance your pictures - without doubt	1

this bag year now love it . this what i carry main compartment : nikon d50 18-200mm lens attached . wide angle 10-20mm lensdepending where i'm going - either d50 charger , speedlight other little accessories or my canon sd550 elph its charger . top compartment holds extra batteries , cleaning supplies filters . small zipper compartment flap little bit tight anything other than cleaning cloth , extra memory , id's/credit cards . cons : woman ... strap isnt all flattering going diagonally across front , but i usually carry it sort " 1/2 slung " position or fully around front anyway ( unless i'm hiking ) . it could little snug inside if you trying carry alot accessory items . would liked see padded portion main strap little longer so padding still shoulder when bag front slung position ( since i carry it way alot ) . pros : compact yet perfect fit my camera body , 2 lens , accessories . very snug secure back - easily hike , ride bike or even horse without fear . no trouble getting used " slinging " it around front . actually use bag kind shelf stabilizing elbows while composing shot . superior lowepro design - great quality , sturdy zippers , love rain cover . note : i try slingshot 200 version 1st found it just too big my needs so exchanged it this smaller version - no regrets , cant imagine i'll ever need bag .	1
just got slingshot 100 my nikon d50 kit lens . previously , i bought nikon bag but this just bag fit camera nothing else , i found this unpractical . d50 fits perfectly slingshot 100 , though i readjust velcro camera compartment dividers first . this quite disappointing i almost no free space my camera compartment anymore ! i guess canon 350d , which smaller body , fit this bag better . anyway i no other lenses yet ( 18-200 still order ) so all my gear ( battery , memory cards etc . ) finds place this bag . bag fits very well , comfortable well-made . before buying though , check if your camera lens fit	-1

this great lens joy use .... keep mind min 1:6 sensors 160mm so you limited respect . would nice if you could see lens settings like focus range preset view finder . don't like fact lens hood not mark show where it installed quickly .. not bad using logo indicator normal use , but always problems putting it back reversed put away . other hoods small dot etc help line it up . this lens grip double batteries get your attention after days shooting it . good news ... when you take it off you feel you pocket camera weight . i posted some action/panning shots this lens there didn't seem any others . couple aircraft couple auto racin	1
i shoot canon 20d used canon ef 75-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 iii usm lens . i've always noticed limitations this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed lens lineup canon website decided canon ef 100-400mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 usm lens . even so , i apprehensive push/pull zoom system . since this lens seems so expensive , i wanted try it before i bought it . after renting lens using it over weekend softball tournament , i knew this right lens me . this serious lens meant serious photographers . lens , there lot more features manufactured better materials . construction sturdy consists 17 elements 14 groups . fluorite super ud-glass elements largely eliminate secondary spectrum . this lens compatible extenders 1.4 ii 2x ii . canon ef 100-400mm lens weighs 3 lbs/ 1,380 , accepts 77mm filters . sure get good quality uv haze filter . white , this lens looks bit strange , but helps keep it cool when using sun . some people concerned white , it attracts attention criminals . my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless what lens i put it . i personally doubt thief looking something steal taking time evaluate cost item more concerned ease taking something they unload . i try make things difficult would thieves insurance back up . dual system two modes . mode 1 stationary subjects while mode two moving subjects . it recommended function not used tripod ; however i used it my monopod success . helps eliminate camera shake helps stabilize lens when shooting moving vehicle . while there limitations what , it give you couple extra stops . just keep mind , attempts eliminate camera movement , not movement subject photographed . this lens permits auto or manual focus depending how switch set . there also switch shift 1.8 m/ 5.9 ft infinity or 6.5 m/ 21.3 ft infinity . zooming this lens takes little time get used if you never used it before . once it gotten used , it seems much faster than typical twist zooming . resistance ring used tighten or loosen resistance zooming . this allows practically locking zoom place or providing no resistance all . zooming simple pulling or pushing lens its name sugges t.t he push/pull system causes air noticeably pushed around . because air pushed into camera , there myth lens causes dust settle accumulate digital camera sensors . i mostly use this lens one dirtiest environments i shoot amateur softball pictures . even so , my experience not support myth . i not seen any evidence support myth any reputable source either . included this lens tripod mount , lens hood , storage case . tripod mount best option use when mounting tripod . this helps balance load . mounting camera instead creates unbalanced set up may topple over . case zippered soft case ( lz1234 ) also purchased separately . lens hood ( et-83c ) used reduce lens flare protect front element certain situations . canon ef 100-400mm such awesome lens , it almost fails compare canon ef 75-300mm . clarity sharpness incredible . auto-focus quiet quick . features add creative versatility . canon ef 100-400mm comes price , but it worth every bit it . now i both lenses , canon ef 75-300mm no longer used . pros : incredible clarity sharpness quiet quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual system cons : heavy bulky ( this should expected these types lenses	1
i very happy this camera bag . slingshot design works well makes unloading equipment far less cumbersome than traditional backpack . i also like features bag . it all great lowepro niceties like protective sewn-in cloth cover sensitive camera viewer before you zip it up , waterproof covering unexpected downpour compartments digital memory cards . it good buy	1
this bag very spacious stylish . it holds my rebel xt my three lenses very well . i even hold 70-200mm f/4 there , although it bit snug . best part this bag it completely customizable . i set it up such way i get any one my lenses just slinging bag around unzipping only top compartment . this very useful when you don't want constantly set your bag floor access your equipment . i one complaint . when wearing this bag sling , it sit your right shoulder . i am more used bags sitting my left shoulder , so take some getting used . when i carry this " non-sling " mode ( i.e. not over my head ) , it comfortably sit my left shoulder . however , best most unique feature this bag ability it sling around access camera without taking bag off , which only possible if i wear it sling bag my right shoulder . it would nice if portion bag customizable well	-1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet .	-1
works advertised . you screw it end your lens , there you go	1
there some you who reading this because you wondering why should i pay more than grand this lens ? some may wonder if what they heard this lens true ? others may wonder if this lens any draw-backs ? first , let look canon product line . one time i owned several nikon cameras believed nikon product line strongly -- but film . technology quickly advancing prices dropping digital front , i knew it time decide again -- canon or nikon ? i happened visiting national park fort scott , kansas . there traveling professional photographer there who digital canon 5d . he showed me myriad ( luxury ) lenses he -- i stopped counting after seven ! " why canon over nikon ? " i asked . " they both excellent product lines , " he replied . " every year their digital camera body designs keep leap-frogging each other technological advances -- but i decided canon because its lenses . " duh ! course , it glass stupid -- i thought myself . based his recommendation , i purchased digital canon 30d body ( i wait technology leap forward some more pricing take drop before i invest more expensive body ) several lenses -- including 24-70mm f/ 2.8 . semi-professional photographer , i took assignment shooting conference hotel las vegas . shots included vendors tables , speakers awards ' ceremonies . rooms dimmly lighted professional photographer who knew hotel suggested i take flash even though he knew i would using 24-70 . it turned out , i needed but one lens entire shoot it 24-70 hood . other gear i used 30d grip , 580ex flash omni-bounce attachment cp-e3 compact battery pact -- all mounted strobofgrame pro-rl using camera quick release system . course , all total , there also 12 batteries : 2 camera , 4 580ex 8 cp-e3 . how shots turn-out ? i really need flash suggested even though i fast 2.8 lens ? first , i tried some shots without flash they turned-out okay , but flash needed professional shots . so , how shots turn-out ? canon delivered what it promised ! shots turned-out beautifully ! auto-focus fast quiet . color saturation magnificient subjects ' skin tones natural vibrant . it true what i heard 24-70 zoom -- quality so good it if i shooting different straight lens different focal lengths -- all one lens ! lens ' hood large impressive looking those who not into cameras . even though it serves purpose , hood its accompanying lens make amateur look like pro ! so why i list all above equipment ? because total it heavy ! you need grip your camera help balance this long heavy lens . i carried camera attached accessories around some seven hours end day my wrist/forearm muscles tired ! yes , i know i could battery pack attached my belt rather than frame -- but flexibility i decided not go direction . , frankly , i not think it would mattered . so , you going get quality this lens , but beware it heavy someone slightly built like myself . this reason , there some talk " image stabilization " added this lens , however , date it mere talk , personally , i not see it happening foreseeable future . also , me personally , because its weight , i not consider this walk-around lens i could carry me hours on-end . i know many argue this statement they probably lot physically stronger than me . so , you buy lens ? my opinion , it resounding " yes ! " couple caveats . price high , but it keeps increasing -- so buy it when rebates available manufacturer . also , not pay big bucks this lens unless you seriously into photography . canon many non-l lenses give you oustanding quality photographs -- sometimes there fine distinction photo derived lens non-l lens . unless you looking greatly enlarged photos , many cases it difficult see differences . so , save your money take advantage canon other quality lens instead . last , whatever you decide , enjoy capturing moments -- life short	1
there very little doubt this one better canon lenses available . however , why buy amazon when it price increase $73 soon canon starts 2006 fall rebate program . amazon officially become most expensive online retailer this lens .	1
this great lens . pictures i take very sharp alive color , brokeh excellent . i am big fan keeping shallow depth field when shooting people or animals , so f/ 2.8 helps out . also dim wedding receptions no problem even weak built flash my rebel xt . autofocus practically silent , accurate very fast . if you don't think you need f/ 2.8 , go 24-105mm f/4 . it extra 35mm telephoto end , image stabilization , lighter smaller	1
i am fisheye lens addict . i this lens few months now , i use it almost everything . lens worth every bit i payed it . sigma customer service so fast easy . lens takes clear sharp pictures everytime . this lens takes best skateboarding band pictures ! if you considering this lens , i would definately reccomend it . i love how pictures either circular or full frame . its great investment ......	1
marine pack dsc-n1 good enough get job . camera special housing setting change functionality camera so it used case . unfortunately , this means losing ability use manual settings . luckily , camera fine figuring out its own settings , though occasionally get picture just right you need it yourself . i taken case 130 feet several times never experienced leak	1
this my first camera i'm very happy choice i made . this camera allowed me take amazing pictures i wouldnt ' dream . i love accentuating colors taking sepia or black white pictures great backgrounds . it certainly aggregated value camera . before i bought this camera i used borrow my brother , i say mine so much better than his . colors more vivid , images look brighter i shoot faster mine . only feature i miss his camera i able cut picture right camera . my canon i wait get home , download picture then cut it . you should take picture if you dont ' like first one . one other thing : camera claims " image stabilized zoom " but didnt ' work me when i wanted take picture no flash . i hope it because lack experience , i'll try improve my skills so i come back give you more details specific feature camera itself . still , knowing all this , i would buy this camera again	1
i gave this camera my husband his birthday . it first digital camera we owned though my college age son his third one - all canon digital elphs . this such great little gadget - it smaller than pack cigarettes , big screen which view your photo(s ) , easy learn use , great taking trips - long you remember keep wrist strap your wrist while you using it so it doesn't drop break . i also purchased small canon digital printer which great us take our aging parents , take photos , print them immediately leave them our parents enjoy immediately . every canon product we own not disappointed us this little camera no exception !	1
i mainly use this when taking landscape shots where i want either make clouds pop or liven sky up some ( remember it works best 90 degrees sun . ) i also put it when shooting highly reflective vegetation or waterscapes would otherwise cause blown-out highlights . one other little secrete use this when shooting waterfalls since it allow you shoot slower shutter speeds thus increasing wispy waterfall look .	-1
you reading non technical review your average fun photographer . so don't expect lot technical stuff . i finally stepped up fuji s9000 . i loved my fuji cameras ease use colors they produce . i little reluctant spend kind money it takes get into d80 . i am thrilled i . i finally digital camera when kids something i catch it opposed camera taking shot after they left room . super fast . few saturdays ago i outside our wooded back yard taking pictures changing colors trees . when i went take shot flash popped up . i said this isn't right sun filtering though trees but i took shot anyway . wow camera new what . unbelievable photos . easy handle even pistolgrip mb d80 . i also sprung sb600 flash great two dvd training program ebay . so don't afraid spend couple grand d80 accesories . you glad you . happy alabam	1
i started d50 loved it very begining . i felt ready step up next level , but didn't think i ready d200 . when i heard d80 , i read everything i could . biggest selling point fact it same internal workings d200 more consumer friendly d50 body . i don't use all mode setting find myself shutter aperture priority most time , but it nice others there when i don't want think or time fiddle settings . camera image enhancements amazing -- but word caution . vivid +2 definitely give you vivid shots -- if not too much so . i've this baby 2 weeks imagine it my camera next couple years . compared canon 30d ( which i thinking ) or even new 400d ( i haven't actually held one yet ) , this nikon . batter life , i recent shoot where i took over 800 shots 3 hour period . battery half that quite bit lcd viewing . this level both canon nikon offer great equipment -- you can't go wrong either . just get one each your hands , snap few shots , go one feels best you	1
i've looking digital slrs ever since canon came out its 10d . since then , there so many so many companies . i've always canon user . i 2 eos bodies-the elan iie 7e . also canon ix , its aps camera which i still ( its small viewfinder major disappointment ) . anyhow 30d came , its viewfinder small too . camera still too large me , i just wasn't sold . now nikon d80 . it narrower than canon 30d , what breathtaking panoramically big viewfinder . such delight use . 2.5 " lcd seems fit perfectly back : nothing bigger or smaller would righ t.t he pictures fabulous . i bought 2 gb sandisk ultra ii card , which i thought would fast . it takes half second picture come lcd , but i'm not complaining . 2 gb big card . it hold 500 photos using normal jpeg , large image . i'm sure 1 gb would faster . canons , onboard flashes never would use advanced metering external flashes provided , but nikon d80 , i see such perfectly illuminated photos onboard flash . 18-135 lens something i jumped . 28-200 35 mm size quite huge range , yet lens not massive . i thought hard image stablization you could get canon 18-85 lens , but naaah , 30d just not measure up so i dropped idea . there always such things called tripods !! entire camera , lens battery feel just right , not too heavy . lens excellent . kit fits nicely into relatively small lowepro bag . this truly camera worth waiting years . 12 or 14 mp models sure come couple years , but i doubt they make bodies any more compact ; file size large enough it 10 mega-pixel . d80 so perfect shape i doubt nikon much better . this one fantastic digital slr . raj	1
i am no means pro taking pictures , but this camera makes me look close it . so far i just used it point shoot pictures really good quality . i am tring learn more functions one i run across so far i enjoy you choose certain functions your photo black white , color , or sepia . i am not high tech but i use this camera pretty easily . my first digital camera canon digital elf only 3.2 mega pixels there huge difference quality pictures when you compare . so if you affored spend more more mega pixels it . only down sides i seen so far it doesn't come w/ great memory card which most not i imagine if i not small hands camera would little awkward handle . it lots buttons dials so you hold just right so you don't hit any . but overal i am very satisfied w/ my purchase hope become better photographer help this camera . canon cameras served my family i very well over years	-1
this my third digital camera , but it few years since second it definitely obsolete . i tempted go top line , because i've two excellent slrs ( nikon minolta ) all trimmings , but prices made unfeasible right now . i'm very satisfied features canon g6 however ; i've taken 400 shots so far , plus one movie , tried out all software stitching panoramas together , etc . i still mainly use photoshop , but canon software quite good . photo quality excellent , including color opticalzoom wideangle range good most purposes . macro setting also nice job . controls easy use most part anyone all familiar full featured slrs , better than most . i've made very few mistakes field result control confusion . what i'm less thrilled ( nitpicking ): like most electronics these days , even if you've got very small hands like me , it hard keep getting finger wrong place , just every square inch covered control . i would liked insert ( like nikon supplies ) cover flash hotshoe contacts . every time i remove battery or memory card , i watch out grab camera few areas don't control them . also , cable input typical tiny plastic door would all too easy break off , neck strap attachment too close memory card door , tends interfere it opening all way . also , preview mode it tells you how many shots you taken but not how many left , shooting mode , vice versa . it annoying switch shooting mode see how many left , especially if you using lens cover , because then lens deploys out , you remember take lens cover off first ( deploying lens cover no-no . ) i also got camera case designed g6 . again like all too many " cases " it tight fit , only single inside pocket you only get extra card still get camera too . case would not really good dust protection it zips up sides but top opening just covered flap . because tight awkward fit , it easy accidentally turn camera , deploying lens , while putting camera into case . case comes belt loop , but you supply your own belt , it no other strap or handle except tiny loop located top end side zipper , where it just gets way . not good design . i also checked out some accessories available , like additional lens flash , but they're very expensive , like macro lights more than camera ! so i don't know if i'll get any add-ons later . but overall , g6 already my next favorite camera my nikon slr , powerful yet easy use , even fun ! definitely 5 stars camera , 1 star case	1
this must product any digital rebel xt owner . always carry spare fully charged battery . amazon competitive pricing structure very timely delivery	1
very good rechargable battery pack . holds charge long time even if camera not used much . capable taking many shots plenty review time . very pleased it	1

after searching internet i found amazon place where this item lowest price . fast delivery , great product . fits great my panasonic 6 megapixels camera . fine leather . could not any happier product	1
great kit , i use it lot . first , here what inside . small rocket blower - great little thing , tends whistle through red plastic tip though . so , it not great quiet places . retractable brush - great little thing , tends shed hairs , but not terribly . cleaning solution - i notice it lifted some color off multicoated lens . oddly , it only one lens , only once . lens looks fine , still takes sharp pictures without any flare . jury out , but i still use it w/o fear . cotton swabs - never used em , but they look nice . microfiber cloth - nice full sized cloth . very soft , great when buffing out spots	-1
beware assuming uv filter recommended amazon particular camera fixed lense size i purchased correct size . it wasn't even close . no size given lense diameter . i returned filter full refund minus my shipping all hassel packaging it	-1
pros : - picture quality very good , but 7.2 megapixel picture 3mb wich pretty big thats reason you might want buy bigger memory card . - big 2.5 " lcd get you some attention bystanders around you . - video mode high quality very good ! this feature impressed me , i use it most ( depening occasion ) . this camera better resolution than my brothers sony camera recorder . some reason my baterry seems drain little faster than taking pictures . ( i own 2gb memory stick pro duo , wich enough record take pictures day , but i don't think battery hang in)cons : - there isn't many cons me , becuase i looking point shot camera 2.5 " lcd or 3 " - only thing i didn't like video mode you can't zoom while recording , other than this camera nice great pocket camera . - pictures come out blury times when you really shaky but sony pretty good image stabilization . ( this also great sport camera wich you capture pitures fast moving object .	1
this great camera traveling , it small enough fit into your top pocket , so it go anywhere . only problem i there no underwater housing it , if there i would given it 5 *	-1

i both lenses , 24-105 4 28-135 3.5 - 5.6 . i 20d , but my wife i decided we each wanted camera ourselves so i bought 24-105 lens 30d 2 months ago . i so sure i'd see big difference lens since my 70-200 2.8 such superior lens . thing , i can't justify it . i've set camera tripod switched lenses back forth taking pictures identical light settings variety subjects . ( they both take extremely nice pictures ) maybe full frame sensor difference would apparent . this point i like extra reach 135mm . i'll let my wife use $1200 lens . my recommendation : money cropped sensor camera i'd stick 28-135 lens	-1
this my all time favorite lense . eat your hearts out nikon , olympus pentex , because this baby alone reason enough go canon . i cannot begin tell you how sharp this " " lense . words fail me . second thought , no they don't . use this lense you'll wind up photos shaper than lightening blade , clearer than ghost eyes , crisper than new dawn uncharted island . i shot portrait two book covers this lense . wedding photos my best friend wedding every one turned out better than ones they paid wedding pro hundreds dollars . i'm documenting growth my child this lense i've caught hundred my girl smiles it yes , sometimes even tear or two . you cannot go wrong canon " " lense . they tops , they really . jack priest , sailor home se	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens . i got this filter friend mine his nikon 18-70mm ed dx lens .	-1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
while this lens great improvement over kit lenses focus often soft raw modes overal just not always tight . color accuracy very good , not perfect but very good . course color accuracy more often result your paper ( yes really - it ) than your lens after you get certain point . after using this lens 2 months shooting perhaps 20,000 shots it i wished i saved my money inevitable series lens . if color accuracy your main issue , sure look your photo paper too . hp , kodak , even low end papers inkpress all strang things color blur your images . try someone like moab paper . you amazed how much difference it make your color accuracy detail . i just switched kokapelli moab commercial prints am amazed results . usually case focus softest 3.5 though it produce surprisingly decent bokeh	-1
i given this lens after my sigma 28-135mm lens broke . while lens fixed , i haven't used it since attatching canon lens my camera . canon 28-105mm may smaller zoom range , but other than clearly superior lens every respect . it sturdy , fast-focusing , sharp , good color . short , it what you hope find when purchasing consumer grade lens . there other cheaper lenses market , like sigma lens or canon f/4- 5.6 , but this lens worth extra $100 its reliability , sharpness overall usability	1
i this product over two years used it extensively my travels . yes it shortfalls " may " considered expensive , but price it better than some other " aftermarket " designs other camera makes . amature timelapse timed exposures it works quite well . far remote instant low light or exposure shots it expensive , get canon rs-80n3 shutter releasethe biggest complaints seems limited number shots [ 99 ] certain modes shortness connecting cable length . using " continous " mode i not failed capture timelapse photos filled my needs . short connecting cable corrected purchasing canon et-1000n3 extension cable [ 33 ft ] . now $2.50 + foot , expensive ! but my persuit remote control capability must . battery life fantastic , thousands shots still going strong . course like camera battery spare blessing [ this case cheap ] . i think it good accessory , if you enjoy time lapse spent money one new eos cam then price comparable your continuing outlay your hobby .

ok start off i've heard different opinions camera sensor blowers .. some say it works like magic some say it make it worse . so i gambled bought this giotto blower . i didn't want buy all cleaning swabs , liquid ect rub it off ... seemed like annoying project . so i gave this blower try . i never much dust my sensor but when made my aperture smaller f/22 exact picture blue sky i noticed few blobs or dust spots . i wanted them off ... now heres where blower comes . i used it total 3 times it removed 98% dust off my sensor .. thats really really good my book $9 device . now i like 2 tiny dust spots my sensor i easily live .. or i could try use it few more times completely get it off ... meantime i'm very happy dust i got off it . buy this blower .... its no brainer .	1
i quite annoyed when i found my d70 come out box dust lens . place i bought it would only send it away nikon cleaning , but friend same camera advised me get dust blower showed me how i should able blow dust off myself . first blower i tried didn't enough power dust remained . i almost decided take camera get it cleaned when i read review suggested this one . i took chance , after 15 minutes trying , checking , trying again , i finally dust free sensor ! this most valuable piece equipment i purchased my camera , i recommend this anyone similar problem	1
one problems owning digital camera you'll occasionally clean dust off image sensor . you can't use compressed air because it freeze destroy your sensor . you don't really want blow either because moisture your breath damage your sensor ... make you pass out . you need " dry " , relatively-high pressure air this what rocket air outstanding . simple use . 1-remove your lens ( slr ) , 2-put into cleaning mode , 3-hang camera upside down ( presumably , allow dust fall out ) , 4-squeeze rocket air thereby cleaning camera . this point , i swear it . i'm constantly changing lenses this helps remove spects ghost images . it must your camera kit	1
this one fantastic flash . i it my canon a2e four years , ambivilent , but if you match this lens one canon newer bodies funcionality access all 550ex features , you awesome , powerful , flexable flash change way you shoot	1
im graphic design student college , so i really needed camera . i decided this one i am really glad i . pictures nice clean . camera itslef very sleek looking one very compact . only downfall this it eats batteries pretty quick , but i just took them out when i wasnt using them . buy this camera	1
after hearing consumer reports gave canon a520 best buy rating , i decided this must good family cameras . it joy own use . easy take pictures , easy work yes , it takes great pictures . it more bells it than i ever use . i very satisfied 4 5 mp cameras not wanted spend fortune more . i just need take pictures , review them easily download my computer . this much , much more	1
i got this much safety anything . if i should drop my lens , solid lens hood help . plastic construction absorb some impact without transmitting all it , metal hood would . hopefully it eliminate occurances flair , although canon 50mm 1.4 lens , that not big issue begin . it also keep dust debris off lens surface if you're shooting less-than-ideal environment . it twists off lens easily . when it , it very snug secure . kind pricy piece plastic , but canon business make money .	1
exz750 simply fantastic compact camera . it takes great pictures , even greater if you bother use one many picture presets ( scenery , portrait , macro , etc . ) . pros : - picture quality great ; if you want anything better you'll probably lugging around dslr- picture presets extremely easy use , even if you not techie / or you've never handled camera your life ( there such person ? ) . - it fit into your pocket you'll forget it there . this major advantage best camera camera you actually you - this one you . - common settings ( picture size , iso , etc . ) one or two clicks away - very convenientthe cons : - camera take videos ( more than decent resolution ) but they come out shaky even if you pretty steady hands . without some image stabilization it , it definitely not replacement video camera- although camera iso settings 200 400 you should probably avoid them due noiseoverall , very positive pleasing experience . even digital slr , i'm never giving this little puppy up	1
this lens my favorite i keep it my rebel xt all times . i enjoy taking macro close-ups portrai t-t ype shots , which makes this great lens everyday use . it light-weight not bulky . my last slr camera ( years ago ) minolta 50mm f/ 1.8 lens , various other lenses i rarely used . i usually don't use zoom lens due extra length weight . also , most non-professional zoom lenses much slower closest tele-position due higher f/stop . fixed focal length 60mm , i don't mind moving myself toward or away subject ( not big deal ) . pictures always appear sharp good contrast color saturation . my opinion this lens : " buy it ... you'll like it " . i ... i love it . good luck	1
4 starts because otherwise 5 stars inevitable : 1 ) slow autofocus ( hunt times ) but expected macro lens . 2 ) built quality not solid expected this price range . i bought this lens instead two purpose : macro portrait ! i thinking buying 100mm macro plus 85mm 1.8 but this lens saves me buying two lenses ! i very happy it what it . i don't flying insects very much so it not problem but said i able get 1:1 shot fly , see sample here : http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_54.htmlthere other samples this gallery here : http://www.theteh.com/html/my_3rd_350d_xt.htmlthe large aperture ( 2.8 ) means one could shallow dof great low light such this pic : http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_49.htmlfor portrait , i accidentally took this photo during london bombing women ' shocked ' incident unfolding public tv display . it coincident her background inmage winning reuter photo tsunami tragedy matching colour their dresses ! i quite far away so able capture her head toe : http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_25.htmlthis illustrate capability both macro normal photography using this lens . you not regret it unless your primary aim shoot flying insets where longer 100mm or 150mm macro lenses may needed this case .	-1
this battery works my canon sd550 interchangeably withthe canon nb3l came it . i get many shots either one .	1
i bought this battery extra battery my camera . it lot lower price than canon battery . i not used either my original or this extra battery enough fully compare them , but they seem work equally well so far	1
its time price ( time ) , fantastic camera . 6.3 mp more than sufficient most amateur semi-pro ( non-studio ) work , this camera works very well what really matters : canon fantastic lenses . battery life this camera very good . " shutter lag " ( when you depress button when camera actually takes photo ) fairly well non-existent , only real lag i when i am shooting multiple photos raw format . most photographers know , lens almost more important than body , outside leica lenses , i don't think anything really competes canon line . 18-55 lens comes this camera sufficient casual work ... i used it beach , hikes my dog , when i don't want lug around my bigger , more expensive , higher-quality lenses . but $75 or so , you 50mm 1.8 eos lens , which supplement 18-55 nicely , particularly night photography . my one complaint this camera its ability meter light adequately dark settings . when i shoot raw this isn't such big problem , because i fix it photoshop , but most everything i shoot inside , unless i manually mess white balance every time , orange tint interesting first 200 shots , then annoying after . i think more advanced eos models come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem , also help bit lag raw shots ... but money , this camera excellent , far , far superior , example , olympus ' digital exquivalent ( similar price ) . difference , far i'm concerned , absolute advantage canon lens quality . you use high-end consumer body like this one , use professional piece canon glass ( lens ) take excellent photos . i wouldn't invest system doesn't also boast excellent lens quality	1
this review really two parts : one amateur who using point shoots , or experience film based slrs ; other one prosumer or advanced amateur who either going digital film canon eos bodies or getting into pro-level digital shooting low end . former , camera pretty much all you need ; latter , it lacking key functionality , but workable . i'm latter category . i've freelance photo work past , but not since digital age began take off late ' 90s . i've shooting eos cameras since early ' 90s , added medium format late ' 90s wedding portrait work . i'll honest : i didn't like idea digital first . sure , workflow improvements over film sounded great , but i wasn't seeing quality digital vs . film . i still am very much believer , least prints , especially big prints , film delivers better overall picture quality . but quality digital slrs since release digital rebel so good , workflow advantages trump film all but rare situations . i'll still use my medium format equipment landscape outdoor pics i'll print large frame , but other than pocket 35mm , i can't see using film much all category , after seeing what i dreb . if you primarily amateur who either used using point shoot ( film or digital ) or who used consumer film slr , you'll find this camera easy operate use extent you used your other cameras . i bought this without lens , i other lenses packaged one didn't offer me anything , but those without canon glass , you get surprisingly good lens kit . remember , though , lens only fit digital rebel , its successors , possibly 10/20d line canon eos bodies . shooting pretty simple . charge battery , which easy -- charger blinks depending upon its charge . you look charger battery there see where you , charge wise . it doesn't take very long charge battery fully . once you battery camera , you'll need compact flash card . i recommend sandisk ultra ii cards . you won't experience any write time problems over above this camera natural limitations . then , set iso value ( 100-1600 ) , set either pre-programed mode one side dial , or traditional program/shutter priority/apeture priority settings other side , you ready rock . remember unlike many digital cameras , led back camers not function viewfinder . aside displaying various camera options , it shows what you shot after shooting . if you want use this advanced amateur/pro setup , you , but know its limitations . i bought this march shooting all sports it . i'm using canon usm lens , gotten some terrific shots . but i've also missed some led me decide sell this camera pick up 20d . problem i get into focusing speed zones . 2.5 fps only 4 frame burst isn't big problem it sounds . i still get good action burst mode , but admittedly 5 fps 22 or 25 ( 20d ) bursts much better . if you want use this shoot something like concerts or indoor events , you won't same focusing issues . you deal any flash limitations , but information , you read review . i'm not camera flash guy under any definition . only real problem i've this camera my shots consistently underexposed . 5- . 7 stop . i shoot exclusively raw mode ( never shot jpg this one other than first dozen or so shots ) it correctable when i convert images . this more minor irritation , may not noticable jpeg shots . i've seen others using this camera complain it well . this camera good consumer camera you find . if pro , or semi-pro , make something function his or her needs , you know consumer get everything they need out this . i've shooting since i 8 or so , owned umpteen cameras , this one fills its market niche good any them	1
i purchased d-30 amazon last year i previously using digital nikon . improvement monumental all aspects . i subsequently drowned my camera , i am getting ready repurchase d30 . they not ready water yet ? i taken approximately 5000 pictures saved them all most usable format i continue same . photoshop software comes camera very user friendly , i am sure there many features yet learn , but i extremely happy what i already used . i hesitate say mastered	1
this camera designed entry-level snapshot camera it very good just . it takes decent photos very easy use . other reviewers indicated , it tend chew through batteries , but i just buy aas cheap sam don't worry it . it works especially well outdoor situtions . it performs less well low light . due this limitation , it just useless webcam . even all lights room , webcam image almost totally black . flash lens less than inch apart , so this camera very prone redeye . there redeye reduction mode flash works okay , but doesn't totally fix problem . all-in-all , entry-level camera , a200 quite usable . just aware what it don't expect it more .	-1
canon lenses known their great optics priceyness . this fast tele excellent value . only thing would improve this lens would addition image stabilizion feature found few canon optics . course , advantage large aperature lenses you set fast shutter speed still enough light shot . this lens surprisingly compact , ( long focal length teles go ) . autofocus very fast quiet . comes hood , too .	1
this standard kit lens comes rebel 20d . this lens most definitely built budget . it ever show ! completely inexcusable lack numbering any kind focusing ring . this very frustrating when it comes taking pictures distant objects , since you cannot simply set it infinity . also , because it goes into macro mode beyond infinity , you cannot simply crank it all way one side ! course , you always use autofocus if you wish . but this doesn't work night photography . fact , you might well forget doing any night photography this lens due inability focus it based estimation distance ( fact autofocus doesn't work dark ) . besides this nagging problem , lens just not very sharp . when i first got my rebel , i very impressed pictures it took , since all i compare it pictures taken point-and-shoots . but after taking several hundred pictures it , i find most cases , pictures very much soft side . this particular problem distant objects . even when focused those distant objects , they never appear really sharp , although objects intermediate distance ( ~ 100ft ) seem okay . let face it . this lens just doesn't it . unless you really hard up cash , steer clear	-1
pros : excellent picture quality , great zoom , nice panoramic feature , sd card , great video sound quality picture camera , best you this money lcd rotate any angle . cons : flash not pop up automatically ; just 16mb sd card box . pd : this camera size not pocket one but size good enough shoot one hand . advice : use rechargeable batteries large sd card ( 2 or 4 gb ) cause video so good you love shooting . also , must times you need flash indoor other way you bad pics ; flash results amazed you .	1
over last 50 years , i purchased four film cameras five digital cameras . far , canon s3 best camera i owned . most cameras i bought cost more s3 . i returned recently three-week trip scandinavia st. petersburg , russia . during trip , i took almost 2500 photos s3 . photo quality excellent , camera controls easy use , camera performance outstanding . i expect use s3 many years .	1
i no investment dslr but narrowed my choices canon 30d nikon d200 . i always wanted nikon . d200 definitely joy hold it take good pictures ( i tried both camera store before i bought 30d ) . i lot research ( more than i care admit ! ) there no conclusive evidence one camera clear edge over other . depending your specific needs , one camera may " slightly better " than other . after trying out both cameras , i convinced 30d good fit my needs d200 . " value money " 30d clear winner over d200 ( i got mine when canon cash canon promotion going ) . also , beginner slr i found 30d its fully automatic scene modes easy start out . i don't expect use scene modes or full auto mode after week or two . i expect quickly graduate creative control zones . but use family camera , quick scene modes very helpful . if you expect use it more professional basis it'd probably not matter . additionally , when i checked it out store , i noticed canon 30d focused sharply almost every time . d200 not least few times . i'd take this grain salt though since it brief trial store . but i thought i'd share my experience . it may just anomaly actual equipment i tried out . i still find nikon d200 great camera ? absolutely ! i regret bought canon 30d ? absolutely not ! decision swinger my case really " money factor " . i more than willing spend up $300 more nikon d200 . but when difference became $550 it no longer became justifiable my christmas gift myself :-) my purchases included canon 30d [ ... ] , canon 17-85mm ef-s usm lens [ ... ] , sandisk extreme iii 2gb compact flash card [ ... ] i plan add external flash this soon , consider eventual lenses after i determine camera long-term keeper .	1
i am so pleased this camera ! there really nothing negative i think say it ! i also own cannon xt . i use both wedding photography well family portraits i am so impressed color quality d30 ! well cannon	1
i upgraded canon digital rebel ( grey body ) this because i ready take my photography new level . one thing i like most this camera it flash compenstation . i purchased 430ex flash it because i tired use built flash always getting those hard shadows wall	1
i purchased filter kit my sony camera . price considerably cheaper than sony quality great ! i'm looking into other items offered good price opteka	1
excellent product works well . made canon ef28-135mm lense . reasonable price	1
when i first got camera i nervous whether or not i'd able use understand it well since i usually buy point shoot type camera . i pleasantly surprised how easy it use all functions it really . pictures really high quality video crystal clear . camera lightweight perfect grab go or capture any occasion . i like design it i love fact i get professional looking pictures time time again ...	1
accessories like lens converters , wide angle long angle lenses , filters i purchased canon powershot s1 compatible canon powershot s2 or canon powershot s3 ? i am looking updgrade , i want know what costs i other than camera itself memory ( since s1 used compact flash memory ) . thanks	1
excellent addition rebel xt . tried lower cost generic flash units . my only regret i waited so long get 430ex	-1
it works great , there just two issues . when you lock it hot shoe , it very , very difficult unlock ( you twist wheel tighten it ) when batteries my camera low , camera flash start computer problems act very strange ( i cannon digital rebel xt ) . other than those towo issues , which comparison seem very small me , flash fantastic ! lightweight easy use	-1
this terrific lens , my new favorite . excellent feature ; i wish all my lenses it . even 2x teleconverter , it rock steady viewing shooting . my images sharp tack great contrast color . i'd pay three times this much get any better telephoto images	1
this canon lens upholds tradition fine products canon line photographic accessories . it takes very clear , sharp , hand held pictures image stabilizer capability activated . it negates necessity carrying tripod every time one wants take long telephoto shots . it should must any serious photographer wanders countryside , taking candid pictures , wants lighten load equipment carried	1
excellent camera high end capabilities . easy use intuitive system controls	1
this camera amazing , i couldn't asked more . just warned manual pretty terrible . it best just play around camera until you figure it out , rather than wasting time trying decipher manual	1
works well normal cameratried it adapter s3 adapter not fit robustly . filter o	-1
ordered one march its came fine ( not used or abused like others mentioned ) . amazon.com retailer . i use it mostly lens protection aspect it works great , fact i'm ordering right now	1
this lens superb . it feels like high quality pro lens ( not surprisingly ) . shots just stunning ; fantastic color , razor sharp , beautiful bokeh etc etc . i initially considered 18-200(vr ) until i saw comments this lens . look into it , what i tell there very little ( real ) comparison two . i believe you forget how much you paid soon you see results . i mention this lens superb ....?	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens .	-1
i get least uv filter all my lenses . that cheapest insurance you get you lense . protect it possible scratches banging against objects . haven't really seen major difference brand filter tiffen filter . i would just go cheapest filter found you lens	1
i am only giving 4 stars , because i just receive it through mail couple days ago . so i still haven't get chance fully try out everything . but i tell you this camera very handy , it very small i throw it my small purse ( my purse usually don't much room , b/c i would already so much stuff it , like my pda , i-pod , cell phone , wallet , keys , pack tissue et . ) take it me anywhere . i love design this camera , it very cool . pictures pretty clear , even one taking during nights . thing i love this camera it not noisy , it very quick ( i no patience , so it good me i snap pictures crazy quickly ) . overall , i find this camera pretty good .	-1
i like canon digital camera because it everything average person may want . it light , great design , works incredibly good i make hundreds pictures . isn't dream come true ? highest recommendation	1
i really looked hard various light ( sub-3 lb ) tripod options use my canon powershot s2 . lighter better , but i also really wanted 3-way pan head all little nice extras i could get : bubble level , quick set-up/tear-down , fits inside carry-on luggage , good build quality , comes bag , good hand crank , etc . it definitely fit bill perfectly , only 2 lbs ! course you don't get super strong wind-proof stability weight , but i really quite happy overall stability my recent vacation . when there strong wind , i leaned bag , backpack , or beach towel around one legs gave me more piece mind ... but i think it probably would fine ... especially when not fully extended max height . before buying it , max height actually my only real concern -- would it tall enough take good people pictures/outdoor portraits while i my vacation ? my experience says -- yes , great people shots ( so much better than typical shot you get asking passing stranger take photo you)!don't hesitate , just buy this one !	1
first , canon 1ds mark ii awesome professional camera . this review completely misleading amazon offer 42% off . this biggest joke imaginable . amazon website shows list price $ 11,999 . 99 . when canon launched this camera msrp wasn't high . it $ 7,999 . methinks someone calculator got carried away . anyway , after adding it my cart see unbelievable low price it turns out its within $100 what every other reputable online shop selling it . i expected more amazon . this behavior reprehensible	1
i shooting digital four years now mostly kodak dcs cameras(660 through dcspro ) . life long nikon guy it big decision make switch canon 1ds mk2 . this camera light years ahead any kodak digital slr . i use this camera studio product , models , location , low light , you name it . canon never produced anything but astounding images me . all image parameters including sharpness far superior any old images i my kodak days . yes it pricey but if you working this camera you pay easily long before it useful days over .	1
this hood comes 70-200 lens my local shop didn't stock it . they said it special order part it would take week it come . i ordered it friday , received it wednesday . not bad . thanks amazon	-1
i skeptical when i ordered pen because i wasn't too sure how clean it would really keep my lens . last week i traveled through out mexico visited some beautiful places , seeing lot family members . all these family members around , few accidently touched my lenses . i decided it would perfect time test my new pen . end result ? perfection ! lenses looked like thru brand new ! i used carry little paper whipes designed lenses , but now i use nikon lens pen i don't need worry carrying whipes throwing them away	1
other reviewers complained plastic foot flash-bracket end cracking or breaking off . solution metal " sacrificial foot " screws into 1/4 " -20 threads bottom . bogen/manfrotto 3298 ( bo3298 ) works perfectly . no amazon vendor carries it this date , but you find it bhphotovideo.com . their listing says it nikon , but it works canon off camera shoe cord 2 well	-1
there not much say this , since there no other alternatives me . simply stated , i went lowest price i could find .	1
this my first digital camera i ever bought , i am completely satisfied it . talk abt resolution or camera feature . all it packed into one small sleek camera . i recommend this digital camera everybody . i would say if i would decided later future get one . i would alwayz go canon . they best making digital cameras	1
i purchased my sb-600 day before my granddaughter birthday party our local skating rink . very little time test unit prior party , i dove right . i amazed exposures very close shots , believe it or not , entire length skating rink . auto-zoom really cool feature changes match your lense setting wide telephoto . i made 150 shots first time out using nimh batteries no significant drain . this time , i found absolutely no negative points . i may even purchase couple more replace my portable photogenic studio lights	1
well priced works beautifully . no complaints - exactly what it said tin .	1
this camera looks amazing , not i ever money it . i am impressed this camera choice shoot feature film ! it used shoot tim burton corpse bride	1
eos-1d mark ii digital this camera i use two months little hard use because it lot things . i am not proffecianal but i liked very much pictures best like any camera i .	1
hi canon lover , it perfect professional users who love capture excellent image . not wait longer buy soon you you not lose anything . keep it up wonderful day canon products . best wishes , appreciation canon product	1
very solid camera , but bit heavy . good battery life . it very professional camera	1
so this great starter lens , it came my canon body when i got my camera , i've used it tons . it light , smooth , fast focus , cheap . my only problem number times i found myself stepping back because 35mm end zoom wasn't wide enough . i now carry 22-55 instead love lens ( come amazon - get it stock ) . if you're budget then this lens great . if you afford little extra go 28-80 instead	-1
these my experiences extender mounted my eos 10d . i'm currently debating whether or not buy it my new 30d , but it looks like i don't want risk wasting my money . let me explain : let me start saying only reason i gave this 2 stars instead 1 because it prevent my nose smudging lcd screen . i shoot events nightclubs lot , so i'm always ( ) running around get shots , causing me sweat , which causes sweaty oily nose tip ( ) i always show subjects their photos after i take them , so smudgy screen kind annoying . further clarification , i'm asian , so my nose not defined or long other ethnicities . i run around lot when i shoot . so constant activity eventually led extender naturally fall off . i got lucky once , found it general vicinity where i , but second time , i wasn't so lucky . so what i ? i purchased one . not only i purchase extender , i purchase viewfinder replacement ( piece soft rubber ) because attached lost extender . 2 weeks , again , same problem . i didn't even bother buying any replacements , this time , i upgraded 30d . if you don't plan doing lot running around , then this piece may okay you . however , please take into consideration this piece also fell off me while putting my camera back my canon backpack . some reason , piece didn't fit tightly mount camera . problem , most people mentioned , images very noticeably smaller through this extender , so prepared strained eyes if you plan using your camera all day . i guess i'll check it out my local camera shop see how it fits 30d ; i'll sure write review if results different than 10d	-1
eyeglass wearer , i suffered needlessly years	1
technical details this lens found abundance elsewhere , so i'll leave experts simply say : this my favorite lens . i love this lens so much . i half dozen other medium high-end lenses , this one i keep camera 90% time	1
when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i'd always loyal film . digital could never take place film . i'm not convinced it replaced film completely . there still something i love putting roll film camera , shooting away , sending film processed , seeing results . i also know it bit expensive . i know argument quality always paramount discussion , but digital cameras improving this regard , most manufacturers assuring users while technology always improving , we point where good investment made digital slr it not outdated soon buyer purchases camera . so i figured now time get digital slr . i loyal nikon user nearly ten years , owned nikon n60 , n70 , n80 . my first love , still n70 ( i've told person who sold me camera he thought i only person who loved n70 ) . i purchased n80 only after my n70 cost too much repair , but i've enjoyed way my various nikon cameras handled all sorts situations fact they simple use point shoot if i don't time use specific controls , but it also options more creative artistic purposes . my nikon cameras allowed me capture family moments ease majestic landscapes , wildlife shots all sorts other things i can't resist capture forever . i decided purchase d70 since it close what i've already experienced nikon . many ways it works similar way n70 80 , except it digital rather than film version . like film versions midrange nikon slr , it dial allows automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , night portrait modes , ability select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . camera auto manual focus abilities . photos easy or technical photographer desires . controls easy use , though it takes practice comfortable . personal level , camera passed halloween test , niece birthday test , fall foliage new england test favorite scenic spots test . only real difficulty i've camera trying capture stained glass windows dark setting . auto focus not worked all i'm not thrilled manual focus these shots , but this point i'm sure it photographer not camera . i one suggestion anyone who purchases this camera . manual very confusing . it uses all sorts symbols more distraction than anything else . i've luck " magic lantern guides " my other cameras , but not yet used it this camera . i purchase nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which helpful . it quick reference anyone already familiar nikon photography general but it also provides introduction novice photography .	1
d70s minor update original d70 introduced 2004 , few new features slightly larger lcd . it still great camera , but expect it replaced new d80 , which 40 percent more pixels , 2.5 -inch lcd , additional useful features old price d70s . so , you probably save little money still purchase sophisticated digital slr if you wait until prices d70s stabilize new , lower level . , say , $600 , this camera would incredible bargain . d70s shined one best cameras its class since its introduction . example , it 1/500th second flash synch speed ( found no other camera but d50 ) so you keep ambient light under control avoid ghost images . its autofocus fast accurate , features both single-autofocus , continuous-autofocus ( tracking action ) , novel " automatic " autofocus mode switches af-s af-c required . if you no nikon lenses , get this camera 18-70mm kit lens , which very sharp versatile , rather than more limited 18-55 lens . you won't regret it	1
this lens ok magnifying 2x max . full zoom , magnification not sharp without close-up lens	-1
don't disappointed because this isn't lithium ion battery . this battery kicks butt !! it lasted me 3 days non stop shooting . i started think battery never going die ! course reality set eventually charge it , but it lasted forever !! only drawback it takes 2 hours charge :( other than , it lasts you all day night	1
well , besides whole bucket full money , one them lets you take photos lower light , okay , that obvious . 16-35mm bit heavier , but not so you'd notice , unless maybe you carrying it around all day , without eating you're bit over hill . so why pay extra money , unless , course , you lot shooting early morning late evening ? maybe you shouldn't , because i've doing lot photo taking both , film digital , one would expect " " lenses , photos crisp sharp . fact i keep i 17-40 camera i carry around all day , you know , one i might leave table restaurant when i got restroom . it lot less money lose someone looking five finger discount . however , my gal pal sara i take lot early morning photos . she shoots old houses , she never , ever goes out without 16-35mm . she swears it , loves it , sometimes i think better than me . so there difference , i'm kind person could happily live less expensive lense , sara not . however they both deliver gorgeous photos . you can't go wrong if lense red circle around it . jack priest , sailor home se	1

when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
i bought sd110 camera , since i live hawaii , i underwater housing it . this housing great , because it allows you use all function buttons while camera protected housing . you power up camera , shoot , zoom , change modes everything but change battery , change memory card upload your pics onto computer while camera sealed up . i able take lots lots underwater surf pictures movies this camera . i very happy results . i treat my gear pretty rough , i water almost every day , not cleaning it all time although housing get scratched little banged up , it still worked great , it didn't affect quality my photos . then one day while rescuing swimmer distress , camera knocked off my kayak into ocean . i went back few minutes later search it . but unable find it .... i really bummed . four months later , friend friend diving same area i lost camera , saw something wedged reef , encrusted coral alge . he pulled it out took it back up boat-it digital camera housing . when he opened up housing took out camera ..... it powered right up !!!! so he took few shots boat then took camera home . he showed it his friend , they flipped through pictures he told him story finding it . one pictures i taken day i lost it , underwater self portrait . when my friend saw : he knew who camera it !!! so he calls me ... tells me story . i amazed . we figured camera housing lying bottom four months over twenty feet water , there few storms produced some very large surf area , so it likely taken beating . but it still maintained its water tight integrity . we all very amazed how durable it turned out !! i already replaced camera canon s500 it dedicated housing ( mostly so i could get higher resolution photos ) . after uploading photos onto my computer , i let guy who found it keep it . he cleaned up housing , it stays still water tight , only thing wrong it ( besides little surface crud exterior casing ) , few buttons jammed so they not work ( zoom , shutter power buttons fine ) . but not bad all camera bottom ocean several months	1

this one four cameras , only digital camera , i used learn portrait photography . class how take portraits not how use camera . i wanted graduate point shoot but consider my budget because i wanted slr film camera also . i got canon rebel ti packed two lenses . it made sense me purchase canon digital interchange lenses . my original choice canon digital rebel , however , my web search , i found eos 10d $750 no catch . there no required additional purchases scam when i called . this allowed me spend extra money i would spent camera accessories . since it digital , i am not shy trying out features . when i first got camera , some photos dark or very light . after tinkering around learning what sensor-indicators means i don't get anymore . 10d more camera than i need i'm sure i it long time .	1
i this camera years before it stolen i replaced it digital canon slr . i am still amazed abuse i put my rebel 2000 through . it nice light body , great auto feature , easy-enough use manual functions . because popularity ( rightly so ) digital these days , you pick one up fantastic price , even brand spanking new	1
i am ameture photographer i love my new camera , i also enjoy my low price amazon your best ! im so happy i finally found price i afford !! thank you !	1
canon rs-60e3 all canon says it .... it simple one handed operation switch open flash , focus , then release shutter once , multiple times , or hold it open bulb exposure . although cord not long enough include photographer picture , it simple enough make " extension " allows very remote exposures	1
it what it says it'll , while it pricey couple contact switches plastic handle , considering cost parts my time make something similar , it bargain . i would liked more heavy duty construction , contacts more definite tactile feedback focus vs shoot position , but it works just fine , it lets me take pictures while talking more easily subject , addition obvious vibration reduction	-1
canon ef 85mm 1.2 lens earned ample praise photographers critics alike one finest portrait ( medium telephoto ) lenses available . it only one currently produced maxium aperture 1.2 ( decade ago carl zeiss introduced special , limited edition 85mm 1.2 planar its contax manual focus 35mm slr system ; this lens alleged optically superior canon . ) . this new improved version 85mm 1.2 autofocus 1.8 faster than its predecessor , via usm motor relatively whisper-quiet operation . fine optic working under low-light conditions , lens now better due its improved optical design faster autofocusing . without question it one finest series canon lenses available ; these new improvements only enhance its reputation . if i owned canon equipment choose canon ef 85mm 1.2 ii usm lens or its illustrious predecessor , then without question i would willing acquire this fine new lens	1

i am professional photographer , i owned this camera nearly two years . i also d70 backup . batteries go forever , it very quick respond , images beautiful , it typical nikon durability reliability . if you already nikon user , controls fall easily hand . said , computer software this camera joke . best image quality shoot raw files , color balance grey card , render images software like capture one le . uselessness included software only reason this camera gets four instead five stars . come , nikon , real !!! shortly after i got my first d70 , i shot model small photo side bar catalog . i got ugly feeling my gut when i told designer taken shot 3/4 figure , cropped head shoulders , enlarged image cover 8.5 11 catalog . time i found out , it already printer . it turned out , i pleasantly surprised : cover shot looked great . after incident , i trusted this camera always pleased results . this camera better than 35 mm every way except response shutter button . resolution color reproduction it more comparable medium format film camera . it imperative shoot raw process files properly get most out this camera . i can't wait try d80	-1

early adopter digital , dating 1999 agfa ephoto 1280 1680 current iteration nikon family , i attest this camera flexible any my film cameras i use studio location work . fujifilm migrated best features mecanical film camera over this model . hot shoe external mounted flash sync terminal off camera flash , cable release socket shutter button , fuji melded best analog best digital . 9 mega pixel resolution , iso 80 1600 , shutter speeds 30 seconds 1/4000 , 1.6 inch ccd sensor , fujinon 28 300 mm ( 135 equivalent ) zoom , tilting lcd monitor ( if you use those things ) , raw file format support , real time histogram display , eleven shooting modes , movie recording , af assist illuminator full manual control when needed , nikon , canon , olympus , et al lot catching up . no need change lenses means sealed camera equates sensor staying spring time fresh body . no dust getting every time lens swapped ( although , i still miss all nikon glass ) . all this less than $ 600.0	1
many options this camera mechanically body camera rather than internal menu so wanting change focusing method etc easy ! shaking no problem 10.7 optical zoom warning icons appear if it may problem . icons appear if subject isn't focused warning you change focusing method . automatic power turnoff save batteries after two or five minutes , your choice . you set camera take instant pictures ; again , your choice . this camera allows you set your options rather than camera go default after power off change it back your option . problem i my previous camera . maybe little pricey , but results great !	1
i love capacity these batteries . use them my handheld gps , digital cameras , 35mm cameras , flashes , everything else i . car power adaptor really nice road trips ! charger recharge 4 batteries time ( either aa or aaa ) , charge even 2100 mah batteries under 75 minutes ( under hour " typical " rechargeables 1600 or fewer mah ) . i not like leaving charger plugged , because i hear it clicking when there no batteries it ( but i hear lots things wouldn't bother normal person ) . also , price pretty high . i succesfully used other batteries charger ( it comes 8 2100 mah nimh batteries seem last longer than other brands rechargeable ) . ask it christmas ... hope discount ( which appears pretty rare monstercable products )	-1

black color adapter hood nice match gunmetal finish s3 . fit good they what they supposed . i noticed hood tends " lock " adapter if you accidently squeeze it when unscrewing it -- probably because plastic bends little . use lighter touch it unscrews right off . one off-putting thing me price these two inexpensive pieces plastic . i know they may precision-engineered plastic nice finish , but please , over 15 dollars each two pieces ? they're plastic ! i know corporations supposedly owe it stockholders maximize profits , but perhaps these could included s2/s3 standard equipment . or sold price more line construction material	-1
very important shade camera lenses avoid flairs . it doesn't fit carrier bag designed canon s2 , s3 , though , which big time bummer . however , i would recommend it anyways , because quality pictures protection your lenses worth carrying different bag rest your stuff	-1
i bought this camera because small size , megapixles zoom + digital zoom . i wanted something take outdoors into wilderness not worry hurting it . price wise i feel this camera offers pleanty featrues very reasonable price	1
this excellent pocket camera it lives up nikon reputation quality . while it lacks some controls seen more sophisticated models pictures please most demanding this class camera . i liked it so well i bought two , one myself one gift budding photographer	1
okay , first off , i'd like say this my first af slr -- i stepped up my dinosaur camera , canon ae-1 manual focus , right now i am quite overwhelmed all features this little thing . i'm still learning stages all this technology but let me tell you this , i am fun ! it amazes me canon offer quite impressive camera price . i just received my first few rolls developer pictures came out amazing -- so clear colors very vibrant . just let you know , i'm using 28-105mm f/ 3.5 - 4.5 usm lens . i took suggestions many passed up " kit " lens i'm sure glad i so . i would highly recommend f/ 3.5 - 4.5 lens , but unfortunately rest you , amazon discontinued it . but you could order it one many other photo shops ( bh , adorama , etc ) . i any regrets this purchase ? absolutely not ! i love this camera even though i've owned it less than month , i'm actually thinking stepping up eos 3 using this backpacking/hiking body . hmm ... what , what ? i purchase body or start collection l-series glass ? ... question .	1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shaped one three quarters inch long offers limited protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . so shallow petal shaped , even this type protection limited . even if protection limited , replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 16-35mm f/ 2.8 ef normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . this lens isn't unusually wide so extra inch may not problem . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality reduces lens flare problems offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store lens	-1
this lens must all beginner photographers . excellent sharpness really fast lens . i know i've heard many complain cheap feel it but less than $100 you can't beat it . yes it plastic mount , yes focus ring small but quality it pictures price make it definite winner until you decide move up much higher priced l .	-1

nikon d50 my fourth digital camera , my first slr camera . i don't know why i didn't try slr earlier , but now i decided i never go back non-slr cameras ( well , i still my other 3 point shoot digital cameras which sometime more convenient carry . ) i guess i'm just trying show how much i like slr camera . now back d50 . unless you shooting sports/actions professionaly ( which then you want buy d2h or d2x faster focusing processor , faster frames per second larger memory buffer ) , d50 pretty much all you need ( equipped several lenses course ) . d50 all pre-configured settings casual photographers ( " child " mode also added d50 , night landscape mode not available ) , it usual , , , mode more serious/advance photographer . i stopped using pre-set mode now strictly uses aperture priority shutter priority mode ( far manual mode , i'm not there yet ) . this shows this camera versatile suitable all ranges skills . comparing its siblings ( d70s , d80 , d200 ) , i think whichever you want buy fine . they all great cameras . it comes down your budget . comparing other brand like canon ( rebel xt or 30d ) , or pentax or sony , it just brand preference ( what lenses you already ) . moreover , if you come point shoot camera user , any slr brand you buy i don't think you dissapointed ( just fact slr performs better most important aspect photography ) image quality d50 good which #1 factor i look digital camera . here pros cons d50 my opinion : pros : 1 . nice out camera result picture quality ( auto setting , pre-programmed setting ) 2 . fit perfectly my hand ( grip nicely ) 3 . instant take picture right away 4 . 2.5 frames per second 5 . large 2 inch lcd 6 . battery life ( take 400-2000 shots single charge depend how often you use full power flash ) 7 . uses sd card 8 . fast usb2 connection 9 . capability copy re-size pictures small size ( great email ) 10 . repeating #1 again . great image quality cons ( which mostly minor ): 1 . no backlight top panel 2 . no black white picture mode 3 . no night landscape mode 4 . no iso 100 ( iso 1600 picture grainy though still usable)5 . no depth-of-field preview button 6 . no front command dial 7 . 1/4000 max shutter speed i started using this camera landscape portrait , but later i started shooting sports/action night ( low light ) settings , hence i added nikon 50mm f/ 1.8 af-d which great prime lens i'm recommending everyone get this " fast " lens . i'm also recommending you get nikon 70-300m f/4- 5.6 af , which nice ( price ) zoom lens . if you budget then go nikon 70-200mm f/ 2.8 vr af-s which i think best zoom lens nikon currently . ( vr really works especially stationary object . if object you want photograph moving low light situation/indoor then you need " fast " lens , i.e. lens large aperture such f/ 2.8 , f/ 1.8 , or f/ 1.4 etc)happy photographing !	1
1.4 ii teleconverter modest update canon earlier 1.4 tc . mark ii allows this extender stacked canon extenders ( either 1.4 ii or 2x ii ) without separate two extension tube ( although loss sharpness stacking extenders may not acceptable you ) . otherwise , quality newer 1.4 ii supposed very similar older model , which i've never owned . 1.4 ii great way extend reach compatible lenses . note not every canon lens compatible this extender . following canon web site : " this tele extender used fixed focal length lenses 135mm longer ( except 135mm f/ 2.8 softfocus lens ) , ef 70-200 f/ 2.8 , 70-200 f/ 2.8 , 70-200 f/ 4.0 , 100-400 f/ 4.5 - 5.6 zoom lenses . " i use it frequently my canon 70-200mm f/ 2.8 , which turns it into 98-280mm zoom . extra reach it adds not tremendous , but it very welcome when i just need little more than what lens alone give me . i've found no appreciable loss sharpness using 1.4 . course , any extender going reduce sharpness some degree , but normal examination , i can't distinguish photos taken 70-200mm use 1.4 those don't . fact 70-200mm f/ 2.8 very sharp lens begin helps this department . using 1.4 decreases your lens ' widest aperture ' capability ' one stop . some lenses , more significant than it appears surface ; when using non-pro canon body ( such my 20d ) lens must minimum wide-open aperture ' capability ' f/ 5.6 autofocus work . lens doesn't set f/ 5.6 , it just ' capable ' least f/ 5.6 after adjusting one stop loss 1.4 . means some camera/lens combinations , adding 1.4 force you focus all your shots manually . ( note : there known ' fix ' this restores autofocus . i've never needed try it , but it involves taping over some connector pins 1.4 fool camera body . proceed caution if you try this , google search learn how it right before attempting it . ) 1.4 also reduces focus speed very slightly . i've only used it my 70-200mm , which canon usm fast-focusing lens begin , but decrease speed so slight i really don't notice it . it not affect ( image stabilization ) all . 1.4 built quality canon l-series lenses , which means it weather sealed keep canon pro body l-series lens weather sealed when used them . if you're considering this extender , you're probably also considering canon 2x ii teleconverter . i not own 2x but lot research it before ultimately deciding go 1.4 . 2x decreases your aperture two stops , reported noticable decrease sharpness -- more than some photographers willing live . other hand , i've never read review complained loss sharpness 1.4 . if you've already invested lot money telephoto lenses , 1.4 ii relatively inexpensive way get even more reach ( value ) out your investment while adding only modest amount bulk your camera bag . highly recommended	1
it what it supposed . nothing more , nothing less . if it little cheaper , i would given it 5 stars .	-1
this good tool , job well , serves purpose , but little overpriced canon keeps changing connectors , forcing us buy new accessories which wrong practice against consumer . i give 4 star because canon , not because product . if you willing pay it , it good product .	-1
hello all , lens hoods pretty much necessity , but this mostly poorly made hood i've ever used . unlike other hoods screw , this one requires you press opposing clips then slide hood one , release clips . this leads problems alignment , meaning both sides clip need perfectly aligned order hood fit right . although it pain i hate ... i don't really alternative . either go w/o hood , or take this one . either way , guess i'd rather hood lense than not one	-1
it works great my ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii lens . price this hood ring seems pricy compare lens price , but it job when it really needed .	-1
i use this all time my son soccer games get great shots . it little bigger side , but isn't too heavy image stabilization really helps out	1
i originally purchased 30d low-end kit lens - me pricing didn't really make sense get either body or higher-end kit lens . i looking good all-purpose zoom full-size sensor covereage case i move up canon ranks new pro-level model future . 28-135 fits bill nicely . although it fairly heavy , difference build image quality 18-55 kit lens incomparable . this lens takes beautiful pictures operates flawlessly . i highly recommend it day-to-day lens , nice feature extending range down few stops without moving up much more expensive faster lenses	1
my existing battery aged i started look forward replacement . after i read several reviews , i preferred choose original one , because heating performance problems . therefore , i found good bundle price if i'd selected cord , battery case my sd100 camera . way , i not good case this new one . i rated 4 stars , because i preferred stay original cord	-1
after researching numerous websites looking canon fitted case my new camera , i again turned amazon found just what i looking lowest price . leather case fits well isn't bulky , just protective . now i don't worry damaging camera dumping it my purse everything else so it always handy impromptu shots . neat , comfortable neck strap just added bonus	1
i ordered this camera december , it since then , it amazing camera . first time i ever professional camera , it takes time learn how use it . it not point shoot camera . if you want large pictures like crop , this may not camera you . however if you want ability take great pictures , learn how use professional camera great price this one buy . ability custom curves , which means predetermined parameters different conditions . ability chage iso random different conditions . you pay five thousand dollars its successor , dx2 , however $2000 this bargin you never find again . jim comfor	1
i bought this trip not only it fit my purpose but it makes camera look even cooler than it already looks . i several people stop me ask me what it so i got chance explain how it benefited me	1
i took plunge bought bg-e3 battery grip canon . after reading reviews off-brand model deciding i didn't want any ' button ' problems , i got canon . i'm very happy it , ( not standpoint extra battery capacity because i 2 batteries all times anyway ) but because i like ' look feel ' additional weight fit my large male hands . i felt without it , i might drop camera any time while it safely suspended my neck , i don't like feeling . i also like able spin camera portrait or landscape shots very quickly cleanly extra set buttons available change tv av settings various effects . i got some exceptionally nice photos waterfall this made it easy use . if you're thinking buying it , it worth every hard-earned penny should significantly enhance both professional amateur uses	1
my 2 year old really active my point shoot camera cannot keep up him . i also don't like washout look when i uses flash . so i researched which slr best meet my needs , mainly catching fast action , candid moments low light photos without flash . canon 30d comes up top list . it best high iso performance its class ( better than nikon sony ) . when i combine 30d fast zoom lens ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 , result amazing . i stop any action daylight , capture every candid expression my 2 yr old fast burst mode , take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod . portraits also excellent sharp image beautifully blurred background ( bokeh ) . even dimly-lit decors disneyland haunted mansion came out superb when we went there halloween party night , without flash or tripod . this really important factor me buy this camera , taking pictures tripod not option when your subject active 2 yr old . but you need good lens make this work well . if you use cheap kit lens , then it probably not matter which camera you pick . remember these 3 all very good cameras small differences image quality you see reviews apparent only when they use best prime lens ( not kit lens)and crop pictures magnify details . sony very good choice if you budget don't need low light performance ( use flash save money ) . nikon more custom function than canon , it really good canon . they both their strength weakness . canon just happens slightly better high iso performance suits my need better than nikon . fair , i should mention nikon d200 tops most reviews camera year , beating canon 30d overall . but d200 bit too advanced amateur like me , better suits someone more serious photography . d80 like " mini " d200 , but slower . so it really boils down what you really need how much you want spend . shooting low light without flash need good high iso performance , good fast lens ( wide aperture , usually expensive ) , image stabilization . if that what you want , canon 30d ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 not disappoint you	1
this camera incredible . i ordered it my husbands birthday he just begining figure it all out . there so many great features . one best how quickly you take digital pictures . our other digital cameras lag time shots , but not this one . pictures crisp it easy even novice like me use . i highly recommend this camera if you want take digital photography next level . it one best	1

i just received this birthday present , am very happy display . i seen some digital photo frames during black friday sales , but all them very lousy displays images looked very pixelated . this one looks great . 720x480 resolution very suitable , 6.5 " diagonal size perfect desktop frame , although it bit small if you wanted hang it wall . there two areas improvement . first mac support . i'm mac user , while it shows up desktop usb drive allowing pictures dragged dropped it , it would nice see some iphoto integration . specifically , i'd like see custom export plugin where i simply select photos or album iphoto , then it would automatically scale them down 720x480 copy them onto internal storage frame . documentation doesn't even make mention mac support all , they should least state it used mac document alternatives getting your pictures displayed , even if they don't provide any software . secondly , controls frame itself bit awkward . i think some work some human-computer interaction experts coud improved interface . i able accomplish what i needed , but there definite areas improvemnt . real differentiator these days display quality , i would definitely recommend this product others i've looked . mac support frame controls minor inconvenience , best	-1

great choice first time buyers . this camera easy learn it advanced features you learn you go ... when you master these you realize you shooting like pro . vast array nikon lenses accessories big selling point me ability control nikon speedlights remotely via camera some really great shooting setups . d200 my dream come true . it provides all professional features amateur would want price affordable . d200 incorporates most latest enhancements available digital imaging including 10 megapixel censor , matrix ii metering , detailed battery indicator , large buffer continuous shoots much much more . buy this nikon	1
i waiting affordable nikon digital slr which i could use my older nikon lenses ( ai , series , etc . ) . i know , i could spent thousands d2 , but would overkill me . suffice say , d200 joy use . it fast , solid , intuitive . those owners nikon film slrs who considering d200 , me it " feels " just like nikon film slr . i previously owned several high-end digital point shoot cameras , d200 blows them away terms its capabilities , degree control it offers , resulting quality pictures you take it . it all features advanced amateur photographer could possibly want . i'll probably never even scratch surface all its features , but its nice know they're there if i want or need them . i highly recommend d200 anyone who , like me , waiting right digital slr come	1
i bought this camera back-up my d2x so i wouldn't change lenses much trip i'm taking alaska this summer . well let me tell you , d200 18-200mm vr lens incredible . it fast , quiet pleasure use . i've read forums 18-200 little soft . so far i totally disagree , pictures i've taken very sharp . i wish this would available when i bought my d2x . if it , i would own two d200 instead one each . highly recommended !!	1
photos exceptional . it very easy learn how use features . i taken some great photos it , much better than my digital . i not encountered any problems . i took it long ( over month ) trip where it subjected rough treatment extreme weather . it came through flying colors . rock solid	1

sony manufactured their cord propreitary connection so you order directly them . most cords purchased $7 locally stores but sony ordered . amazon best price this item it works great but it annoying you purchase sony original part	-1
unlike rest reviewers here , i bought this camcorder store singapore . this gave me huge advantage try out camera before i bought it ! i paid us $450.00 ca6 [ which included all required cables , 2 cd-roms software , carrying case , 2 batteries { one 1.5 -hour one 3-hour battery } , 4gb ultra high-speed sd card , 2 tripod mounts { no charge } , multi-port usb hub 4 different types sd cards , power cords adapter u.s. singapore voltages ] . after reading all reviews here i agree some " cons " comments . yes , it not come tripod mount hole . however , salesperson gave me two black plastic tripod mounts free . it fits like glove -- no problems . sorry , i don't know where find these u.s. but i'm sure they're out there somewhere . yes , hand strap useless . seriously , throw it away ! it not worth effort . my wife gave me her camera strap use it fed through bottom ring works much better . only way protect lcd screen camera lens keep it carrying case when not use . this case real convenience metal ring could attach belt loop my shorts or pants . lot people complaining low light situations . i haven't noticed too much this . salesperson told me this " sports " model version . i shown several other models sanyo similar ca6 . this gave me impression ca6 geared more towards outdoor use it proved itself worthy . it small camcorder so it took few days get used filming it . plus , i'm left-handed used it like stubborn left-hander my left hand -- but i finally got used it . i know it wasn't designed this mind . however , i think it gave me advantage over right-handers bigger fingers . i didn't worry using all buttons hold camcorder same time . i know this sounds funny but if you're left-hander you might appreciate this info . yes , i am one those who use two hands dial phone number or play games my little cellphone , hehe . oh , using highest quality dvd setting video gives you 2 hours 45 minutes 4gb sd card . sure get some type camera strap this device -- not one provided [ i think this sanyo afterthought ] . i realized this one day i 100 feet up skyride singapore . i dangling my feet , i wondered how awful it would ca6 slip out my hand watch it shatter into 1,000 pieces below me .	1
we bought this camera right before going vacation found it extremely handy convenient . we took great video great pictures it . here some advantages disadvantages we found : advantages : 1 . very small compact - it small camera bag attached my belt . it ready moments notice take video pictures . i able take it places regular camera would likely not go ( roller coaster ride , water ride ) . it all times my hip very handy , it never got way . 2 . water resistant - our last camera went dead because humidity water . i took this camera water ride my son , filmed whole thing , got soaked , no problems camera . 3 . great outdoor pictures - excellent looking pictures outdoors . doors good if there enough light . flash very poor not go very far ( understandable given small compact battery ) . 4 . lots settings - even this small camera , there plenty settings ( wind reduction , noise reduction , image stabilization , iso settings , exposure , flash , white balance , etc . ) 5 . video compression - i found video compression not good minidv tape , but still extremely good , given i could record 1.5 2 hours video my single 2gb sd card ( we also bought exta , which easily fit bag)6 . battery - small battery , total time not last long ( 1 hour ) , but we could carry several other batteries our bag ( same one attached my hip ) never lost out because battery failure ( we 4)7 . flip screen - all you flip screen out , camera , ready go pictures or video . it one hand . same shutting it off . disadvantages : 1 . no view finder - only screen see what you videoing , however i amazed how well i could see screen even direct sunlight . 2 . low light pictures - like i said , flash poor not put out much power . there " candle " setting helps take pictures dark places , but you keep camera very steady because it keeps aperture open longer . 3 . cables - one more cable add my stash . it type usb one end ( computer ) new plug ( not sure what it called ) used both video out put usb output . however , i never use this given my laptop sd slot so all i remove card slip it into laptop download everything . 4 . pistol grip - first this way awkward , but time i learned hold it very comfortably still operate everything just fine . got keep tabs your index finger it easy place it over lense . i held it much more comfortably after i began using strap , which i put over my hand , more questionable situations , i strapped it over my wrist . 5 . zoom - only 5x zoom , it little slow zooming , but actually made playback look smoother , so pick your poison . 6 . photos while video shooting - while you take photo during video recording , it freeze video few seconds while it records picture . nice , but i thought video would still seemless . i usually don't use this feature , but it turned out handy . 7 . non-swivel screen - screen flips out , but not swivel any other direction . open or closed ( closed position , screen visible open possible damage . this made it little harder film things times where i wasn't directly behind camera . we love camera , so glad we it . quality near minidv , software we use ( nero 7 ) works great mp4 snap turn into dvd . only reason we gave it 4 rating instead 5 due few small disadvantages it plain simple fact camera features not replace all features you would find dedicated digital camera . but you bought it video , right ? so how i complain 80% excellent quality i got pictures i take ? hence 4 out 5 . end , we got more video footage than we would larger video camera simple fact its wonderfully small size	-1

i just received this camera gift . i love idiot-proof menu . instruction guide actually readable . it feels like film slr , size perfect smaller hands ( my boyfriend finds buttons controls bit too cramped ) . image quality great , though i've not used it wide variety settings ( yet ) . feature which i love this camera flip screen . this appears most " advanced " digital camera this feature . artist model , i shoot myself alot . flexible flip-screen allows me get odd angles self portraits . my only complaint auto-release maximum 10 seconds ( making complex self-portaits difficult ) . i got remote shutter accessory , so hopefully this won't pose too much challenge my self-portraiture	1
seems panasonic finally dropped hammer pseudo dslr market , 420mm 12x or 749mm - 21.4 3mp outstanding especially ois . excellent pictures out box , menu operations plentiful , nr reduced jog dials front back aperture or shutter very professional . leica lens crisp sharp , i shoot aperture priority nr minimal pictures even jpeg look like they post processed , simply amazing . after experiencing this camera i sold my nikon d80 , attachment lens soft pictures nikon giving me unacceptable , i went thru every menu option including using much hyped rgb3 which way gives cartoon colors no comparison panasonic . high speed usb my only complaint data transfers , noise reduction higher iso noise bit over powering but acceptable but controllable your liking , 3 " , screen would nice but maybe next model . btw , moon shots raynox 2020 3mp give zoom 47.08 optical or 1647 mm optical , hand held shots ois ( image stabilization ) enabled gives jaw dropping pictures , you actually telescope ois your reach , simply amazing . 100% satisfied .	1

overall i am very happy this lens . i use it hdr-hc3 it definitely widens captured range no distortion . it especially useful if you working small areas or find yourself panning around frequently . i 2 complaints this lens though - it obstructs flash my hc3 so i only take photos this lens good light . this really more design fault camera than lens but ... other thing it not allow you use any filters - i would like use some polarizing filters etc which this not allow . otherwise good product would recomend .	-1

this handy item . my camera case crammed pretty tight i stuffed my lens hood adapter ring into it . not wanting my memory sticks get squashed possibly not work i invested little bit money insure it wouldn't happen . this case hold 4 sticks together which more than i'll while ( especially 1 gig 2 gig media memory ) . however , this picutre wrong . it not flat like this all . if you look under velbon dmsp-sm4 , what case looks like . i acutally like one better anyhow . but if you looking very flat , long case this not one . if you want one little thicker chain-order this one-you not dissappointed .	1
this my first digital camera i really love it . i am enjoying using it so much . i recommend this camera highly	1
although my camcorder delivery ( extra fee ) rapid well timed planned recording weekend , my excitement quickly turned disappointment after opening package . i unable either charge battery or use camcorder because seller delivered version suitable only foreign power supply . other words , power cord unusable us . this means lost weekend minimum , longer delays higher costs likely obtaining suitable power supply cord . my first business this seller laid egg form expensive movie camera	-1

this charger main selling points : 1 . it 4 separate independent charging circuits , each able charge 1 battery time , 2 . batteries barely warm up during charging . heat what kills nimh batteries , so low temp feature grea t.t he first unit i bought two defective circuits began act up after weak use , where it either not terminate charge or it would terminate far too prematurely . i should returned it exchange , but didn't because i lost receipt . anyway , i bought second unit it worked fine so far . besides defective circuits , one minor nuisance design if you insert cell slot charging current would only come if cell above some minimum voltage . some my nicad nimh cells , cells sometimes experience temporary polarity reversal or very low voltage after prolonged storage . no matter how many times these cells inserted mach 1 charger , charging circuitry would not come . i think this safety feature insure dead cells won't charged , but it frequently weeds out batteries perfectly good but some reason either experienced temporary voltage reversal or fall below cutoff voltage . charge these apparent duds , one needs " dumb charger " doesn't safety circuitry first revive cells give them positive voltage before putting them mach 1 . negative mach 1 design cells usually less than fully charged when unit finishes charging . reason this cells heat up quite dramatically near full charge , so it sacrifices fullness charge cell longevity not charging cells fullness order keep them cool . note 1-hr . charging time based 2000 mah batteries . if you put batteries less or more capacity , charge times proportionally change	-1
this holiday present my son ( dad expecting use it too ! ) , whose handheld games eat batteries prodigious rate . it already hit today ( dec . 25 ) regard . ( i bought dozen maya powerex 2300 aa cells addition those supplied lenmar . powerexes very highly rated user reports , but also bit pricier than average . ) previously noted others , unit ships batteries insulated charger terminals thin strip clear ( all but invisible , fact ) plastic . this should really " pull tail " it , or note stuck unit saying " please remove insulator before use " or some such , i bet they get tons doa reports people who just plug unit supplied cells still place expect it start right up . description this unit amazon page says it comes four 2000 mah cells , though time i placed order , 2300s/2400s quite common . i figured , no big deal regard . i pleasantly surprised when unit arrived four 2300 mah cells ! course , compensate this , one four supplied cells turned out dud would not charge . unit seems work advertised . " one-hour " theoretical charge time 1800 mah cells . unit charged two supplied 2300s 75 minutes , third cell took 90 minutes . ( you charge individual cells any combination any four slots . ) individual red led indicators initally come after cell insertion , during rapid charging , then go out again when cells nearly full trickle-charged . if serious problem battery , its led flash , or case excessively-drained , dead cell , led not come all upon battery insertion . note this ( led dark ) looks very much like normal indication battery finished charging , so you make sure lights initally come each cell you insert it . it too bad dead cells don't also cause flashing error warning . while any cell rapid-charging , unit internal fan runs . this normally audible , but not excessive , whooshing air noise . ( manual states not run unit if fan not operational . hopefully unit also its own thermal auto-shutdown protection this possibility failsafe ! ) case my unit , fan blades striking inside case , so fan noise like cross cicada really noisy electric razor . probably cause warranty return , but i would prefer not going through hassle if it avoided . gently flexing plastic case loosening case screws bit give top smidgeon more clearance , i managed eliminate noise . contrary other reports , i observed batteries became noticeably warm during rapid-charging phase , but not overly so . pros -- * use charging slots individually , any combination * very good " intelligent " charging performance * comes both ac 12v car adaptors * supplied decent-capacity aa cellscons -- * ( minor ) should warn user batteries ship insulated * should more specific led warning severely-drained ( " dead " ) cells * can't leave cells trickle-charge indefinitely ( manual recommends removing cells after 4 hours max ) so unit needs somewhat attended when use * minor flaws my particular unit ( one dead supplied cell , fan buzzing against case ) probably not common , but it could indicate quality control tolerances bit tight . note most " cons " simply require using unit correctly , so long you careful user , this unit should very well most uses . -- jm	-1

if you're thinking buying this camera ... i few things you concious beforehand . 1 ) if you're going taking sports pictures ( your kids , or whoever ! ) you're indoors our outdoors darker day or under lights , camera not take any decent pictures . they're all too dark . this one big disappointment me , regardless if you're sportsmode ( this acutally makes it worse ) or just taking photo normal mode .. it doesn't come out . if this one major thing you're planning doing camera i would re-consider . 2)the zoom isn't what it could -- times it little frustrating how little distance 3x really . just thought . overall , i love camera . i highly recommend getting big memory card so you go long weekend/vacation without worrying going over	-1
i bought dsc 200 last year , after spending thousands hours reading these reviews !!! i've never better camera . so , thanks everyone who reviewed this camera , recommended it . this camera takes credible photos inside car , window closed , going 60mph ! it fits your pocket , stays charged up days . there lots features i still not figured out , but all you need point , click you get great photo	1

this camcorder incredible high definition picture quality it very easy use . it very small makes it very convenient carry it you everywhere . because small size it bit difficult beginning handle it well control zoom but after some time you getting used it no problem . lack hdmi , microphone input minor shortcomings this camera you also hd quality your tv component connection you very rarely need use external microphone small non professional camcorder like this . contrary theoretical characteristics , it shoots great low light indoor environments . very low light environments there flash light . image quality general under any circumstances it just perfect . only serious weakness motor noise tape recorded other sounds microphone sillent environments . other environment sounds captured great very detail . battery also limited but second one you easily solve this problem . however not using player mode much avoiding integrated screen shoot , one battery pack could enough one day moderate use . i think it perfect camera general purpose .	1
everything i need hd camcorder . select good capturing software or work mac get best results video . controls easily used one hand	1
decided get this battery utilize original battery spare . however , this battery , we never needed spare . recent trip hawaii , this only one we used . through long days diamond head , waikiki , dole pineapple plantation , polynesian cultural center , day trip big island , this battery never ran low . recharging day end only thing needed . great performance	1

this underwater casing wonderful ! i took it record video my sony dvd-405 camcorder while snorkeling mayan riviera coast mexico . other casings this camcorder cost much more ($800 ) , but they rated much greater depth scuba diving . it very easy use : first , attach bottom plate ( provided kit ) camcorder , second , hook-up camcorder cable provided ( don't forget turn viewfinder around ) , third , slide camcorder into casing , fourth , grease o-ring , put desiccation pad , apply non-fog liguid . then , just close case , press outside power button start recording . i amazed quality how easy it use . we good light , clear water lots fish video . best video filmed mid-afternoon sunlight coming angle . we took casing down depth 12 feet but we filmed fish stingreays who water deep 30 feet still got good pictures . casing floats surface without any weight attached it . i no problem recording moving camera around under water . viewfinder works differently than recording without casing takes few minutes get used it . snorkeling pictures , just few feet below surface , using this casing produces great quality great value	1
i know sony already great reputation , but i impressed this product . it small light-weight , but it pretty bright . it also auto function ( just like flash ) , so if you're not sure when you'll need it , you just use function . my camera doesn't built-in flash , so it works well video still shots . it tad pricey , but it sony	1
pros : - brighter than expected small light- price- really helps low light , even cam performs well low light- no batteries - draws camcons : - drains cam battery - you may need bigger battery camthis light what i hoping , fill dark areas low light , particularly peoples faces . this makes much more pleasant videos my family friends . downside home videos your subject often not like harsh brightness shining them . it really bright when pointed you . i started selective when i really need light because it so conspicuous often i want video sideline capture " natural " expressions without neusance . value this light pretty high me . price paid benifit my videos very good	1
after careful review hands-on comparisons canon xha1 , sony v1u , panasonic vastly overrated hvx200 , jvc hd110 , i opted canon xha1 . surprisingly , v1u quite " noisy " all settings , appearing no better quality than my obsolete trv900 . apparently , 24p v1 this moment un-editable most nle except sony mediocre " vegas " software . until 16gb or 32gb p2 card introduced drastically reduced price ( unlikely ) hvx vs film camera comparisons seem justified only cost each precious minute astronomical cost celluloid . jvc lacks auto focus feature , which fine long you've got camera crew tow complete professional focus puller . bottom line , canon optics second none . xha1 low price answer canon flagship xlh1 , same camp , far superior camera this bunch . standing ovation amazon overnight delivery xha1 , which arrived pristine condition time promised	1

without doubt , if canon not make best digital cameras out there , least it makes most popular digital cameras . s400 s410 first two which made cannon so successful digital camera market . later sd series definitely push canon no . 1 digital camera seller us world(sorry , kodark yields canon this year hp considering leave this market ) . so far , i am still happy my choice made 3 years ago . i used this camera almost daily , taking over 12,000 pictures already using this s410 . it still strong , except few scratch body . i am satisfied picture quality . before this one , i used fuji , kodark also used other nikon , i would say , s410 still best use gives best quality . if considering next digital camera , i would take even smaller size canon sd series without question . this camera not perfect , anyway . but please tell me , which one ? it might not never one . however , it good enough me . specificly , cons s410 : startup not fast , focusing sometimes takes longer time than expected . not good contiguous shooting . also i got famous e18 error after two years heavy use . lucky enough , i just tap it against table problem gone . other than , it so far so good me carry it use it everyday	-1
anyone here remember kodak royal gold ? well this film same thing , just re-packaged spiffy new " hd " box . overall quality prints made this film pretty darn sharp , even cloudy days . note some situations bright subjects result cartoonish colors which seem bleed into each other . grain minimal far amateur based film concerned , my opinion it outperforms fuji superia x-tra 400 . considering kodak uc400 now available various common department stores 2 dollars more , i'm ditching hd far less grainy professional uc line film	-1
i bought this camera month ago our trip roatan , honduras . my wife i avid snorkelers we wanted inexpensive camera ( not throw aways ) take great pics sea life vibrant colors we see through our mask . this camera one . divers our resort blown away clarity each picture . also , pics i took land excellent well . one pics i've posted ( sunset ) now desktop background one my co-workers . i read every review this camera before i bought it when i saw pics reviewer hawaii , i sold . i hope my pics help .	1
small size rugged construction makes this camera very practical traveling . availability numerous settings enables capturing high quality pictures under various conditions . this camera produced many excellent photographs	1
i own various digital cameras , cheap point shoot pricey slr small camera , this one great . 10x optical zoom camera fits your pocket awesome . i took it wildlife sanctuary 10.3 meg slr , pictures this camera almost good those taken 300mm zoom slr ( least 4x6 8x10 , i didnt try anything bigger yet ) . easy navigate screens , loaded options . i would definitely buy it again . dont let other brands 3x 5x optical , plus digital zoom fool you . digital zoom degrading pixels . this one buy if you want camera fits your pocket zoom close .	1
this best digital camera i've owned . first , i believe camera should fit into my jeans pocket so it me when photo opportunities arise . it not smallest camera market any means , but it fits comfortable into my levis . i use this camera all time . second , zoom amazing . 10x optical zoom camera fits my pocket ! because camera built image stabilization , deeply zoomed pictures look terrific . third , my wife finds it easy use . this says lot . i'm techie , but she thinks dials menus intuitive easy / quick use . fourth , camera takes 16:9 aspect ratio movies ( or regular 4:3 if you prefer ) . image quality much better than i expected . image stabilizer probably helps improve quality , but i played videos our 42 " tv . quality appears just good our normal cable signal . definitely not hd , but good enough share short videos friends tv more than sufficient emails youtube postings . fifth , we very pleased image quality . because we amateurs , we take pictures under all sorts less than ideal conditions ( low light , moving subjects cameras , long zoom shots rocking boats , etc . ) . this camera sharpness , colors , details better than any other digital cameras we've owned over last ten years . pro might not satisfied , but we . sixth , it works great iphoto , mail , iweb , imovie our mac , so sending pictures or videos via email , making webpages them , or editing them into movies / slideshows very , very easy . battery life sufficient , but i would rather it took standard batteries ( aa or aaa ) so i wouldn't bring charger vacation . charger small , but takes valuable space tight suitcases . first , i not thrilled manual lens cap . however , i veiwed this camera store before buying amazon . salesperson convinced me integrated / automatic covers provide less protection likely places mechanical failure . big lens lets lumix pull such massive zoom definitely needs good protection .	1
absolutly love this camera , dont tyink its worth how much its up , maybe little over priced , but absolutly greaqt non less . never single problem . pictures come out great . however , pictures come out tad blurry when flash not . but other than , fabulous	1
easy use , works described , compact , whole kodak easyshare system dream well designed	1
this item recommended me my daughter . she explained it actually easier cheaper than buy batteries camera . i keep my camera sitting dock , so it always ready use . i recently took camera dock vacation me it always ready me take picture . it not available local stores , so i very happy i could order it amazon	1
works advertised . aware when using flash lens it cast shadow picture . also your view through view finder partially blocked , but you always use lcd screen	-1
i bought this kodak easyshare c360 it worked perfectly , just i needed , charged battery lasts very long time .... product just described	1
it just what i looking . i thought price right also , it less expensive then retail	-1
this product delivers exactly promised we could not more pleased . pictures wonderful . initial downloading process straighforward problem-free . we actually purchased three photo frames ourselves our children they love them much we . slideshow feature wonderful well . everyone our friends seen photo frame equally amazed this product some not aware such product even existed . sure , they expensive but worth cost . we enjoy our photo frame years come we update new pictures regularly . thanks folks philips getting this soooooooooooo right .	1
excellent item protects my digital camera well ; nice sized external pocket carry extra batteries ( 4 aa ) extra memory card . very durable still looks new after 2.5 years use . taken it india/abu dhabi back well all over us still hold up well .	1
well aside what said , i say velcro part could annoying , however it big secure enough make you feel safe avg user who wants just camera nothing more professional , extra storage batteries your usb cable . all all , better then nothing good value . you wont feel need get rid it anytime soon	1
this camera really good , easy use , macro mode , i like take pictures collectibles watches , really awesome images you get . i also canon digital xt , 100 mm macro lens , light box ; well some pictures i took this a430 camera , almost same quality ones i got more expensive equipment	1
i lot research before buying this cam . mix features quality supported my purchase , if i needed cam i would buy this one again	1
we purchased this camera several children christmas presents . it easy enough use out box 7yr older , however menu system bit difficult navigate more gadget-oriented kids fared bit better . response kids great , it several key advantages over slightly cheaper keychain type cameras . it supports external memory card ( sd ) , flash , doesn't lose pictures if batteries die or removed . usb connection ( windows xp ) worked fine without needing install any additional drivers . less than $40 it great present , picture quality sufficient most " snapshot " applications , feature list rich enough allow kids learn something digital photgraphy . we not tried web-cam feature or recorded movies so not know what video quality like	-1
mostly plastic , spindly parts lack smooth motion . mine came broken out box - plastic cap screw which holds eyepieces place shattered . better spend your money higher quality product	-1
i wanted 10x50 long time watching stars . ideally you should buy binocular bak4 prism astronomy ( this comes porro prism ) . bak4 ones sell higher price . price i saw this one ($26+free shipping ) , i thought i give this try anyway . it not disappoint . it comes carry case . it over month since purchase . still working good	-1
it great stand money . it didn't work right out box , ( this only reason i give it 4 instead 5 stars ) but some serious elbow grease some wd-40 stands now work just fine . money though , it very versatile package that neatly transported single bag	-1
pros : this truly high end digital without bulk dslr . great feel features . it slow first standard sd card , but installed very fast , sandisk extreme iii ( 20mb/sec . ) digic 3 processor instantly unleashed . now it performs i hoped . i think reviews would better if they used faster cards . shutter lag gone i take continuous shots amazing speed . menus controls excellent . movies great , too . cons : no raw ( if you need it ) . red-eye similar all close flash cams , but easily removed included software . no zoom during vide o.o ther thoughts : g7 smaller lighter than reviews say . it really feels like camera , not tiny toy . battery life not bad so far ... likely buy spare . oh ... it takes very nice photos , too .	1
after switched 3 cameras 2 years , i think i safely say this perhaps best pro-am camera around best value money . very easy use pictures very close real thing .	1
great camera , just chosen editor choice pc mag well . [ ... ] i it 3 weeks now , couple family parties later i am really happy this little one . fits even tight jeans pockets , quick take pictures . face recognition works really well , not flawless , but really amazing . i took 300 shots so far they mostly great quality , some indoor pictures without flash bit blurry , if you don't hold it steady . my 4 year old niece running around it took nice shots just her own automatic setting , pretty amazing . flash bit strong when close indoors . it takes fast pictures very easy understand . i still read manual , though . ;-) i added fast 2gb card even video quality pretty good , althought just avi format , not mpg . sound great . it even speaker when you play video review . outside pictures outstanding quality . i some outside self-timer family pictures enlarged store 20-30cm , picture quality awesome . highly recommended when you want camera you carry you all times	1
canon all way ! i've s230 , sd300 , sd400 , sd630 . i really not like feel sd630 very much after living it while . i also didn't like button placements .. not comfortable it . it take great pics video . but , i moved sd1000 ( black ) , it one week love it ! all canon point-and-shoot digitals , this my favorite . it tiny so pocketable . pleasure use . switches buttons where they should feel good . screen 2.5 so people who want 3.0 need go sd750 which basically sd630 replacement digic iii processor . same form factor . if you liked sd200 , sd300 , sd400 , sd450 or sd600 , you love this ! my only reservation how great pics this little camera . i'm sure they excellent but jury out how good they compared earlier canons . i like vivid pics so i may set camera vivid . got good deal amazon	1
i owned canon powershot s-series ( s330 ) , a-series ( a540 , a570is ) s2 . i wanted 28mm wide angle point shoot , so i bought this because canon sd800 outrageously priced . i'm canon fanatic , so prepared multiple comparisons . however this camera worth crossing over panasonic . pros - i definitely enjoy 28mm feature . bright rear display wonderful , os quite intuitive well . also it gets great battery life . ~ 300 shot estimate specs pretty realistic . cons - compared canon cameras this my conclusion - all canon camera much truer white balance presets . even red blue fine tuning options , indoor dim lighting really hard , snow lighting . this camera takes much more saturated contrasty photos than canons . even when fx01 set less-vivid , it way more saturated than canon most vivid setting . end result dramatic unrealistic photo sometimes . ccd noise issue . this camera sensor much noisier than canons ' . nothing dramatic deal-breaking , but don't expect same crisp , clean shots canon take . finally panasonic image stabilization . it really not hold its own against canon . i used 570 handheld shots 1/4 second , sometimes longer , decent results . same goes s2 ( which i highly recommend digital camcorder/super zoom hybrid ) . panasonic sensor doesn't seem match iso standards you set it , it wants slower shutter speeds 2.8 iso 100 than canon set same f-stop iso . so , despite fx01 mega ois , its longer shutter speeds mean you still get shake you wouldn't equivalent canon . i know canon , canon , canon . well , i told you i'm biased . after reading these cons , why would you get this ? it 1/2 price sd 800 ( if you shop around ) it must city photos , big landscapes ( skies look so cool wide angle ) it vital indoor group shots ! buy it , but don't expect world it	-1
i spend hours pouring over reviews trying decide which ultracompact best deal best overall camera . end , it came down panasonic fx01 cannon sd600 . i read warnings other reviewers panasonic images weren't top quality , but i chose ignore those reviewers because paper fx01 looks like it would out perform sd600 . i wrong . after using fx01 few days i knew what those other reviewers talking - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera great , but it just wasn't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera amazon ( very easy-great service ) because poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs why you take photos , right ? i know someone sd600 he very happy quality . judging customer images sd600 page amazon , i think i should've gone cannon	-1
i love this item i recommended anythings . me encanta lo recomiendo para cualquier usuari	1
this kindof impulse buy . i originally went buy kodak easyshare but it sold out so i got next affordable one which this one i say i thinking taking it back because i hadn't researched it but after trying it out reading manual i changed my mind it works perfectly all functions work , flash ontime , it simple it looks great ! i've it one week so far nothing gone wrong but we'll see so far i'm love w/this cam .. not taking it back .	1
ok , so i bought this camera because friend exilim z700 , i loved features . i wasn't quite prepared what i got . this camera amazing ; i love it carry it everywhere i go : take photos myself friends , take video funny things i see streets , record rehearsals performances even auditions ( it vocal recorder records 49 hours !!! ) . there so many uses i've found including posting quality video internet [ ... ] . everyone i know comments quality video pictures come out amazing . i'm just layman far photography concerned , but i feel like professional when i use my exilim . it sleek easy manipulate ; it very nice size display screen ; buttons prompts very easy follow . if you're thinking buying it , look z1000 first ; but this one should steal mpeg4 technology which like movie footage . happy snappy	1
my wife purchased this camera she adores it . it easy use produces excellent pictures . important feature this camera its viewfinder . many manufactuers , including casio , eliminated viewfinder most compact models such this , forcing us use just display screen . although screen more accurate than optical viewfinder , it virtually useless bright sunlight . we particularly like dial camera , allowing user more easily switch modes without need push menu button scroll through various options . while this not slimmest compact cameras , it still quite small handy	1
puts my powershot a70 higher level photographic ingenuity .	1
this great product , fine gift , espcially those who love photographs but not techie or don't computer . i diappointed auto shut-off feature couldn't disabled , but fix below our friend quot ; customer west des moines , iaquot ; brilliant worked me first time , less than three minutes time invested . company should send him/her dozen these picture frames figuring this out	-1
michael bates ' review error . all true rechargeable batteries 1.2 volts so this charger operating correct specifications . non-rechargeable batteries 1.5 volts	1
it amazing how much they squeeze into such small space . i owned one form elph or , past 7 or 8 years , they've always top quality . this version no exception . everything you'd expect one leading names digital cameras . screen big , menus onscreen information clear everything very intuitive . picture quality fantastic ! crisp hi res , many options size quality . detail some my shots simply astounding ! video capture some best i've seen none dedicated camera . 640x480 @ 60 fps mode , quite startling when you first see it . improved video capabilities one main reasons i upgraded . battery life seems very good . infact , i'd say it bit improvement over my last elph . i purchased extra battery , so i could charging one , while using other . i still haven't switched batteries yet :) overall , very please . this great , stylish , neat , full featured , camera	1
i this over 6 months now i cant really complain it . its compact easy use . however , people glasses would trouble using it . i use it without my glasses(there power caliberation you match ur eye power ) then its very clear . easy carry around solid . very good its price	-1
this camera great because its size its features just what you looking digital camera . it fixes blurring zoom cability takes phenomental pictures . it good investment future memories	-1
this wonderful camera . i nikon coolpix s1 . it also excellant until i dropped it . i replaced it this s7c . view screen bigger , 3 " . camera itaelf slighter bigger than s1 but still very compact easily fits pocket . play back photo feature easier use than original . picture quality superb . s1 , s7c slow take pictures flash mode . this cause you miss some candid shots . camera certainly worth cost .	1
strengths : excellent video audio quality . great still pictures . cool touchscreen lcd . night shot video amazing . built flash very powerful . weaknesses : battery protruded outside kinda gives odd look . user manual supplied not very informative ... u got explore all menus urself . u need docking stn connect pc . summary : hey , no more additional softwares convert all other video formats , directly recorded mpeg format , connect pc rip your dvd .. its easy . picture motion browser supplied handycam cool very handy , you trim out unwanted portion your videos . i waiting this since long . i purchased this just bcos its predecessor sr-100 big hit , this one all features sr-100 some extra features	1
i love this camera . it super easy use takes fantastic pictures . megapixels such you even blow things up still good quality picture . i would highly recommend this camera . i zero problems love canon products	1
i wanted camera whole family could use - including my 10 year old son . this camera proven much more ! what impresses me most astounding battery life quick focus features . it excellent price point well . our pictures no longer suffer dreaded ' redeye ' effects . i upgraded 4 year old olympus4 megapixel camera am blown away improvements over period . canon rocks	1

i love this camera ! i own sony f707 , now discontinued since broke this only other camera market tilt/rotateing screen . this ideal when you children because you don't get down floor you just hold camera waist level tilt screen ! it takes great pictures great video too ! i love it	1
photo quality excellent ! like 10x zoom . ability this camera its large zoom 6mp fit shirt pocket great . my only complaint tiny size multi-selector . it makes selections unnecessarily difficult .	-1
viewer back really big . i like features it . panoramic help particularly nice . main downfall this camera time lapse pushing button picture actually taken . then after picture taken , you wait little while it stored . it takes good quality pictures , but it hard " photoshoot " toddler any pictures look okay because toddler faster than camera . i haven't taken any strictly scenery pictures it yet , but i hunch those turn out great . there vivid color setting pictures i taken outside very nicely colored	-1
i got this camera my birthday year or two ago it awesome ! it handheld , it works great , it never blurry ! this probably one best presents ever given me !	1
i am jewelry designer struggled idea spending hundreds dollars photography set-up photograph my designs , yet i needed photograph them pictures i taking just didn't capture details i needed . friend relative just purchased this item really liked it , it seemed perfect solution my problem , price right so i ordered it . i couldn't happier . set-up easy . unit super-portable , little tweaking here there , picture quality fantastic . only negative it seems tiny bit flimsy i wonder if it stand test time . but even if it lasts just few years , i consider it money well spent . really great item great price	1
i recently hired shoot hundreds small items catalog . rather than take my large light setup , i took studio-in-a-box shoot . little unit left all day 3 sessions three days . photos look fine i saved great deal set-up time . all this unit really needs make it perfect some sort diffuser/reflector front ( help lessen glare glass bottles such ) . included camera stand isn't quite strong enough many dslrs ( including mine ) but most photographers already own decent tripod or two . it paid itself many times over	-1
i love this camera , i love quality still video . great purchase . everything everybody wrote here true . however : * it requires proprietary usb cradle download pictures computer . it doesn't standard usb jack . so get ready pack cradle whenever you going travel . * it uses its own proprietary battery gets charged when camera cradle . if you run out power while outside , you can't just buy couple aas use them until you get back home . * if you carry it your pocket without carrying case , it flip turn itself battery discharged . i thought buyers should know this . these minor annoyances make me sometimes choose take my old , clunky 1.2 mp sony trips instead this one just because it so much more straightforward . anyway , it good camera .	-1
before i get k10d , i experienced olympus e-500 , canon xti , nikon d80 . i used olympus e-500 take lots vivid color pictures i love very much , but no water resistance no second display window , also only 3 focus point makes it not so enjoyable . same thing happen canon xti , no water resistance no second display window make it little hard use when you need change settings . nikon d80 great camera but also no water resistance shake reducer build camera , color tone d80 isn't kind i would love . finally i bought pentax k10d , feeling body , water resistance , shake reducer , auto dust remove , vivid color tone , etc ... makes me feel k10d way go . only complaint would limited edition lens hard get . get it while you	1
i pleasant surprised k10d it combines built-in image stabilization , self-cleaning sensor , easy-to-use image controls sealed body . it just fills right my hands . i'm not going repeat all good pints found previous reviews . but i want comments some " cons " . yang mi point out : " 10m not much bigger than 6m (* ist dl ) , it good but don't expect big difference ... " more pixels isn't give you better image . you wouldn't see difference 5x6 or 8x10 print . but if you want print 24x36 print this when you need more pixels . overall it great camera big step forward istds/k100 series cameras . i like k10 more controls body before bared menus . i like raw button big time . what hold me give k10d five stars it af . even af much improved ds still not fast nikon d70s . highly recommended	-1
it hugs camera perfectly . i love it because it fits my purse . good price leather too	1
good product-compact easy tuck pocket or camera case . useful item clean lens everyone needs this good photos	1
camera itself if fine but please beware . they show product weight 20lbs meaning you charged over $40 ship when box it arrived shows 3 lbs . said , i really like camera , it going take while get through all features but seems far superior standard point clicks i using .	-1
i noticed there aren't any pictures my mom around after her passing . so i decided her pictures displayed , but instead printing framing lot it , i decided get digital display . i got this digital photo viewer lot less than what others charging this didn't disappoint . 16x9 aspect ratio not best since you convert your pictures 480x234 it fit perfectly without stretching . cameras don't take anamorphic shots even widescreen . other than , i left pics high resolution allowed some stretching view 16x9 . brightness crisp you play controls get used . music not play while photos viewed . maybe more expensive brands trick . i figured i always turn music player if i want listen music . 7 " viewable screen , it good enough . i'd recommend this price alone if you looking simple photo viewer doesn't involve lot gadgetry	-1
this battery compatable those camcorders : # dcr-hc20# dcr-hc30# dcr-hc40# dcr-hc65# dcr-hc85	1
night when i noticed this frame superior conventional frame holding paper photos . this bright sharp . frame looks acceptable any living room . my wife it work where 350 pictures slowly work through slideshow . her colleagues love it . simply drag drop , { buy least 500 meg card } , files your computer card , then insert your card side digital frame . you change couple settings it . it simple menu . overall , monkey could figure it out . i bought one my wife office we just bought her mom dad	1
very happy this multi function camera price . five stars value ... it records digital video low file size . asf format easily read winamp media player . i tried pull video into adobe premiere edit no luck but windows movie maker accepts it allows you export it out into many workable formats . video file size amazingly small . 512 mb sd card we took couple hours video . mp3 i card took up more space . camera 16 mb internal memory ... not room much . get big sd card .. they getting really cheap now . quality video ok . its not high def video any means but looks decent my 17 " laptop . there setting 640x480 its looks good my big screen . most videos i get net not good quality size this little guy puts out . you need decent amount light this work well . also slow smooth motions while recording help get better quality . music plays well this device . menu find songs isnt great . you just scroll through songs find names . file names appended hard read . i beleive due screen size . defeintly not meant music player but plays mp3s none less . i took look ipod nano it tiny . but i like this because all you get money . ipods nanos just music players non expandable memory ( 2 4 gb ) . photos ok .. i noticed alot artifacts some photos while others came out smooth . alkaline batteries didnt last too long . i read somewhere it best use batteries rated camera use .. nicad or something . read other reviews more info this . use camera other functions there spin wheel changes function camera video camera music .. etc . so this device fairly easy use . web cam i havent tried but plug it into my computer monitor myself easily ... its decent monitor i'm sure it web cam thing well . overall this device great value . it all its functions fairly well easy figure out . $99.00 usd you hardly go wrong . but if you need high quality any one features look specialty device .	1
i would recommend this lens all d50-d80 users , price you get incredible sharp throughout its focal range , macro function impressive . also , it very well constructed nice balance very light	1
compre la dvc7 hace ya poco mas de un a�o en amazon . la compre porque mi esposa estudio la carrera estaba interesada en tener sus propios negocios en el tema de video digital . voy separar el review en varios temas que me parecen fundamentales : calidad de imagenla camara tiene 1ccd de 1/3 sino me equivoco , lo cual la hace medianamente aceptable entre las camaras de tipo consumer , ojo , no hablo de las semi pro o pro . sin embargo , tiene un calidad de imagen impresioante en ambientes de iluminacion controlada . si vas usarla en ambiente oscuros , encontraras algunas cosas que te sorprenderan si no estas familiarizado con las camaras profesionales . en conclusion , si la vas usar en situaciones de iluminacion razonable , te ira de las mil maravillas ( tengo unas imagenes excelentes filmadas con esta camara)construccionel formato de la camara es grande , tipo camara profesional , lo que la hace relativamente impresionante primera vista . digamos que el 99% de las personas que te vean con esta camara pensaran qeu definitivamente sabes lo que haces ... la camara es basicamente plastica , no pesa mucho , apenas 3 kilos . no pretendas usarla con una glidecam sin el soporte de cuerpo , simplemente sera imposible de cargar . el viewfinder me parece muy pequeno , no es adaptable para usar con el ojo izquierdo . la pantalla lcd mide 2.5 � , no me parecia pequenna hast que compre otra camara , una sony con pantalla de 3.5 se ve inmensa !, pero la de la panasonic se ve muy bien tambien . ubicacion de controlesla camara peude ser utilizada al hombro , tipo camarografo de tv , o con el asa para mano , en ambos sitios , tiene control de grabacion zoom . el zoom del asa es mas suave lento que el zoom en la parte del handgrip . algo que me encanta me resulta super util cuando fimamos eventos largos donde no puede haber edicion , es la posibilidad de hacer fade sin la necesidad de estar grabando ( ideal para cuando usas la camara con salida directa sin usar cassettes ) . por lo demas , los controles son faciles rapidos de comprender yy utilizar . ventajas contra otras camarassi quieres utilizar funciones ed pros sin ser uno de ellos , pero aprender en el camino , esta camara es para ti . tiene control de foco con un ring en la parte delantera , entrada plug de microfono , salida de audifonos , control de volumen de grabacion , ganancia , etc , control de shutter , de ganancia ( basico en situaciones super oscuras ) , control de white balance , etc . problemas ocurridosdespues de unos meses tuve que enviarla soporte tecnico por un problema medio extranno , se colgaba queria grabar , aparentemente era u problema con unas piezas , investigue en internet aparentemente nadie mas le sucedio , por lo que asumo qeu fue mala suerte un problema con estas camaras . otro detalle fue medio anno despues , durante un evento en un hotel , aparentemente no le fue bien con el aire acondicionado , ya que me saco un mensaje de condensacion luego de varias horas de uso , un poco de ventilacion continuo en el trabajo sin problemas . impacto visualdefinitivamente se ve bien , tiene el peso correcto si quieres ahcer tomas suaves , no es muy pesada como para que no la opere una mujer , no es muy liviana para que se mueva con cualqueir pequenna reaccion de tu mano . los clientes siempre les llama la atencion el aspecto de esta camara , lo cuale muy bueno cuando de negocios se trata . manejo en la pcse conecta sin problemas , la utilizo para bajar subir video en formato dv con premiere , studio , etc . en conclusion , si no quieres gastar en una sony de 3ccd o una canon tipo xl2 o similar , quieres tomartelo con calma , esta es una buena opcion , no te va defraudar	-1
case too small looks bigger web , i returned product	-1
this case fits camera like glove ! it looks nice protects it - accessory you should get this camera !	1
works well ! tested it first like directions say watching out stray hairs , dirt , etc . then took it too pool , works perfect .... dont concerned few super tiny bubbles come out first , they hide seal wrist strap . i overly cautious . best $6 uw housing i'll ever find	1
i knew i would need backup battery my olympus e500 . this identical battery supplied camera . i wanted use olympus battery after reading some bad reviews knockoff replacements . battery seems plenty reserve power even though e500 full color display all functions instead 2 displays most dslr ( one usually low power lcd display exposure settings ) . i only long term experience nimh batteries point-n-shoot so i really can't make final review longevity lithium-ion batteries . laptops seem lose holding power over time . so far i'm happy , but if something goes bad , i'll update my revie	-1
great product , even better price !! i'm thrilled quality ease use . i love it ! great birding , recommend very highly !!	1
these glasses should not bushnell name them , which misleads one think they good quality . i bought them my son , time i got around sending them , i discovered plastic housing cracked where front lens screws , so lens misaligned . it past 30-day return date , so i glued crack kept them my own use . they still not right , but i keep them my car occasional use . my advice -- spend some extra money get good pair .	-1
we bushnell finally wore out after twenty years , tech out paced it . i bought pair glasses vendor , these . this superior set . easy adjust , powerful , fact too powerful our backyard feeders , we use compact pair yard , save this beach bird walks . bushnells not super compact , but compact 8 x40 model i bought going ebay this week . good buy , should last twenty years . if you new birder , keep it simple , buy these several birdbooks , fun	1

kodak color cartridge paper easy share photo printer which i purchased great product great bargain . convenience able make my own prints my kodak easy share photo printer perfect me . i take lots digital prints sometimes i want make prints i immediately share my friends family . even though cost each print may little higher than you would pay drugstore or online printing service , results much better . since i love take pictures i enjoy enhancing them printing them myself , this perfect product me . you enhance your photographs your computer then print them kodak easy share photo printer . quality prints kodak thermal print system absolutely incredible . everyone i share prints remarks how great photos look . all all , kodak ph160 color cartridge photo paper kit great deal me	1
this obviously made work kodak-branded printer docks camera docks , so don't buy this paper package if you don't own one or other . said , i strongly recommend getting this 160 package instead smaller packages because ) it ends up much cheaper when you consider how many more pieces photo paper ink you get , ) even if you don't print lot , you'll use them all up sooner or later . it not like they expire , right ? considering you get free shipping no sales tax if you order it amazon , than several-dollars-cheaper-than-best-buy price sounds even sweeter !	-1

this printer wonderful . it presents great prints quickly through variety connections . its prints high quality quite water proof ( water just beads up , nothing runs ) . i think anyone purchasing it should know few important points . 1 . wi-fi card sticks out printers side preventing you closing slot cover if it installed . 2 . you don't " print " it through bluetooth , you copy pictures printer file transfer utility . ( this mean you send your cell phone pictures directly it if your cell phone bluetooth ) . 3 . setting up any wireless options requires usb connection your computer . 4 . it no on/off switch . i am very happy this printer	1

i love this little camera ! after waiting 10 years buy digital camera , i'm very happy this one . 1996 , i working digital imaging lab first point shoot camera's; said time i'd buy one when resolution reached 2000x3000 pixels , they affordable . this camera what i waiting . combination ability shoot asa 1600 , sharp images , good size , price under $200 ( rebuilt ) factors made me choose this camera . slightly clunky menu system small capacity xd card minor problems , but shouldn't stop you buying this camera	1

i many traditional film slrs including original pentax k1000 ( fully manual ) , canon rebel xos canon elph . when considering digital slr cameras canon digital rebel point-and-shoot canon digital elph top my list . but $150 less than canon digital elph , casio exilim ex-s series better buy same features ( some cases better execution same features ) . if you're looking fun point-and-click camera record audio , avi movie files digital pictures this it . it takes 15 miuntes read manual you're off taking pictures . pay attention when reading manual everything else seem very intuitive . all cameras i i use this one most often . other users complained proprietary lithium ion battery but 3rd party equivalents available right here amazon site , you just look . my back-up battery only [ ... ] bucks . san disk 1gb memory cards cheap too , [ ... ] online , [ ... ] retail . last , i agree many users lock switch needs developed so you keep camera accidentally turning when it your pocket -- but remember many cameras this problem/lack/this feature . i solved my own issues buying [ ... ] case belt loop	1

like most , i've owned many cameras over years - canons , fujis even polaroid . my favorite fuji . digitals , my current stable includes these cameras : - canon a520 ( 4 megapixel ) workhorse - sony dsc-w7 ( 7.2 mp ) - 2.5 " viewfinder new addition : - fujifilm e900 ( 9mp ) - 2 " viewfinder work i , i needed raw format 9-10mp this fuji e900 camera fits bill . originally , i wasn't looking point-and-shoot . hoping get 10mp raw which prices you out compact camera range into more expensive slrs . this fuji fits nicely - not quite bleeding edge 10mp but very good near point-and-shoot size . note : others mentioned , this camera rated high consumer reports . here my ratings : pros = = = = - good ergonomics- fast on/off/store- supports raw ( it really wasn't hard find menus)- aa batteries ( my canon , sony fuji all use aa nimh rechargables)- photoshop pulls raw image right ( it supported camera )[ ... ] cons = = = = - fuji e900 2 " view finder little small ( same my 4mp canon a520 ) but this camera * * few years old . - flimsy camera terms plastic quality . fuji cameras built price though this one good value today prices . sony w7 feels more substantial . sony survived drop 4 feet onto pavement ( same day i bought e900 - go figure)- 16mb xd card included can't even fit * one * raw image throws " card full " immediately after setting format " raw " * before * i even took picture . i waiting 1gb xd accessory card but geez , not even one raw photo out-of-the-box ??? - 1/3 larger than my sony w7 . fuji no longer " fit shirt pocket " compact camera but quality higher mp worth it . other cameras looked : -panasonic dmc-fz50 10.1 mp - one i wanted but too much $$$-fujifilm finepix s9000 9mp - not compact . cheaper than panasonic-fujifilm finepix s9100 9mp - not compact . " " -canon powershot a640 10mp - great specs . great value . my #2 choice . but no raw mode . get 1gb xd-picture " " ( high speed ) type card - you'll need it if you use maximum 9mp mode especially if you use raw - storing speed . it worth extra money if you're shooting raw . if you don't use raw , get slower " " card save money	1
this camera truely incredible ! pictures really come out beautiful it really easy use . only function i find not superior rest macro function . close up photos not clarity even cheaper fujifilm cameras . other then i highly recommend this digital	-1
i leaving college this fall wanted little something easy handle send home videos , or post them . it works great ! i am especially excited compiling them onto dvd my laptop dvd burner . it so tiny it fits my pocket it very good batteries , you need buy scan disk ( i suggest 512 mb or 1 gig ) but it still turns out cheaper than regular clunky sized video camera . course it isn't amazing quality but it small enough take anywhere capture every anything . great deal money	1
nice little bag . it fits my jvc everio videocam power adapter my little canon elph its power adapter . no room left videocam remote , manuals misc cables . good little bag . i would liked it weeeee bit bigger so i could fit extra junkbut otherwise very good little bag ( good price )	-1

this product delivers exactly promised we could not more pleased . pictures wonderful . initial downloading process straighforward problem-free . we actually purchased three photo frames ourselves our children they love them much we . slideshow feature wonderful well . everyone our friends seen photo frame equally amazed this product some not aware such product even existed . sure , they expensive but worth cost . we enjoy our photo frame years come we update new pictures regularly . thanks folks philips getting this soooooooooooo right .	1
this fabulous gift grandparents if you preload pictures . just aware customer support folks not knowledgeable , probably since product new . don't bypass their software load pix if you're transferring your pc frame - their software reduces memory needed each one . even though software different size frames labelled same , it not compatible you only one version installed your pc time	1
we got this camcorder our daughter her birthday she loves it ! her only problem it memory card needed because there isn't much space she would like alot light needed film . we aware both these complaints when we purchased it but we certain she could work around them . we also aware battery problem , so she got rechargeable batteries . awesome little camcorder , especially price	-1

this product rugged forgiving . accurate +/- 1 ft ., this absolute must all serious bowhunters . lightweight easy use , i find only one minor design flaw . it designed right-handed use slightly cumbersome those who choose use it left-handed hunters ( i am ) . even this minor design flaw , i still am very satisfied this unit would not hesitate recommend it others . most encounters under 50 yards ease use accuracy critical elements hunt . i harvested nice elk this year 52 yards using this unit . thanks bushnell	-1
bought this flash my evolt 500 . great flash most types typical low light situations fill-flash . it offers all advanced features creative lighting such bounce , diffused light angled bounces . allows manual settings works incredibly well auto settings camera . olympus makes several accessories this flash help you get this off camera multiple flash or slave set-ups . more power throw distance , complete professional capabilities , go more expensive fl-50	1
i recently purchased this item my evolt 500 all i say wow . i went camera store held both fl 36 fl 50 decided go fl 36 . fl 36 alot smaller which i liked . i'm gonna mainly use it vacation pictures , birthdays holidays . so i really don't need fl 50 . my opinion , if you're not gonna shooting weddings , you really don't need fl 50 . i've noticed 500 always problems focusing low light . camera would search , fire af illuminator off like crazy , it still wouldn't focus . even just focusing regular indoor lighting problem . this completely solves this problem . i able focus my girlfriend complete darkness .. accurately quickly . i already thinking getting different camera year or so just because low light focusing issue . but now .. i'll probably use this camera good five years , if not more . even if you weren't looking external flash ... buy it . just improvement low light focusing alone worth money . recycle great , i threw cheap dollar store batteries just so i use it first day i brought it recycle time fast enough . i'm not really trying shoot night pics indy 500 . stop searching buy this item . i also recommend sto_fen om-600 omni-bounce diffuser . its made nikon sb600 but if fits perfect my fl-36 . nice snug . it makes big difference . trust me , you'll thank me comments later !!!!!!	1

this camera very nice . i actually bought it my g/f she loves it . when it first arrrived i got mess w/ it bit before giving it up her . i really enjoyed different settings take picutres . its great cause usually you get those shots way too bright because flash or too dark because no flash . this camera takes care both problems easy . i even enjoyed software it came w/ . only problem i when you upload pictures computer sure you push " safely remove hardware " button or you end up getting camera say there more pictures camera than there . this easy solve though . theres way you clear camera memory but im not sure i remember how . so problem more user error than product problems . great camera great price . it might not same prices since i got it electronics expo so it knocked down price but it worth original price . so theres my review . not depth but point . good enough	1
similar tripod i owned great if it paint hadn't begun chipping after 1.5 year gentle use ; since i've only this tripod 2 months , i hope sony paint more durable ! otherwise , this one shortest compact tripods becomes one longest when its legs fully extended . this makes better camera height angle versatility especially when used or near ground level . it also sturdy enough hold any typical ( not just sony ) point shoot digital camera ( i not used it camcorder ) stable even if mounted sideways vertical pictures . furthermore , this only tripod i found comes pouch ; it wonderful avoiding scratches other damage if you tend store your camera its accessories one bag .	1
this small tripod proved quite useful . first , because its size , it absolutely portable , fitting into side pocket camera bag . it allowed me setup stable shots even when visiting places where carrying full-size tripod not possible or least not convenient . i also use my digital video camera shoot still photography small electronic components . this mini-tripod wonderful these shots , it allows camera still very close up subject yet still mounted stable surface . , trust me , when shooting such small subject , any hand jitters show up every time . i definitely recommend this anyone using digital cameras , whether video or still photography . it very handy piece aluminum you	1
this camera so cool ! it small enough carry around my purse . it very intuitive learn use . kodak website contains loads information user friendly . most all pictures beautiful	1
before i bought this camera , i worried some reviews . i guess you can't please everyone . long you recharge camera , or carry spare li-ion battery , you fine . zoom great , but really outstanding feature this camera wide angle lens . you won't just using it those indoor family shots -- it great outdoors too , taking additional scenery without distortion . panorama feature easy use , too . i took 245 pictures 7 days love this camera	1
i love this camera case ! it manufactured very fine materials . it very soft touch while protective my camera . craftsmanship outstanding . it well worth purchase price then some	1
first , i'm giving this 70-300mm lens 5 stars rating partly because price quite attractive especially used ones ( version lens even more cheaper picture quality isn't too much different this ed glass version my opinion ) . if your primary objective take pictures low light situation such wedding concert , then get 80-200mm f/ 2.8 or 70-200mm vr f/ 2.8 instead . get this lens ( or it cheaper brother 70-300mm ) any means unless you already those alternative more expensive zoom lenses i mentioned above . pros : 1 . inexpensive ( vr version released , many sell this one)2 . you get up close personal ( 300mm which equivalent 450mm if you attach it dslr ) 3 . very sharp fast bright light situation ( outdoor etc ) , though it gets bit softer you get closer 300mm 4 . very light 5 . bokeh suprisingly good 6 . great portrait 7 . ed glass better contrast picture quality8 . metal mountcons : 1 . though more solid build than 70-300mm version , external part this lens still made plastic . ( but i don't think you should care this ) 2 . very bad low light situation especially if object moving/sports photography , but still works fine long exposure tripod like photographing fireworks or night light building/city/car lights . 3 . focus seems slower low light situation ( focus hunting bit more ) bottom line : this lens loves lot light . if you give this lens lot light , it take good care you . last but not least , after you get this lens , go buy nikon 50mm f/ 1.8 af-d prime lens $100 or less ( equivalent 75mm if used dslr which very good portrait semi-zoom ) . this very fast lens works extremly well low light situation even without using flash . this lens complement your 70-300mm ed lens very very well . also check out 70-300mm ( half price ed ) 70-300mm vr ( released oct 2006 ) . vr feature works really well static object . if obect moving then you better off fast lens like 50mm f/ 1.8 af-d , 80-200mm f/ 2.8 af or 70-200mm vr f/ 2.8 af-shappy photographing !	1
i'm interested lens , heard it great , price good . however i can't find description whether it grey market lens , which may or may not covered nikon warranty i believe one year warranty , or usa warranty , which i believe three year warranty . either way , description needs clarify this . other large internet vendors ( reputable ) offer either types lens charge 10 or 15 percent more usa warranty	-1
i used them last night see sky 20:00 . i saw very clear orion its nebula , pleiades star cluster , saturn , venus . not very good use holding them hand . so make sure use heavy tripod . next step : reflector telescope .	1
i ordered these two weeks ago just started using them view moon ( yowzer -- they bring light ! ) view raptors , ducks , other birds half mile across section susquehanna river below conowingo dam . i floored how well these . i not only see incredible detail birds middle river small islands , but birds completely other side sitting trees . my husband able identify blue jay sitting shrubs opposite bank . they not heavy use without tripod . i arthritis both hands could use them easily , propping my elbows occasionally nearby fence , but just steady myself brisk wind , not because they too heavy . i am very happy i not go my first instinct get spotting scope tripod . i walking spot spot easily , picking out different winter visitors , while fellow viewing birds keep folding up his spotting scope tripod , moving , unfolding tripod , resetting scope -- too annoying ! this works very well half-mile distance i am using it , closer distances delight ! very pleased this buy	1
although , i haven't gotten white screen ... yet , i problem opening battery latch . maybe spring broke or something , anyway , i called sony them fix it . they going charge me over $100 fix it ... finally today , i got butter knife pryed it open . finally after 4 months cameraless , it opened ! i going pay them fix it . battery life minimum , but other than ish , great camera :] lasted me japan , got great pictures	-1
this charger works great . compact design flip down plug , indicator light shows it charging when its complete . very happy this product	1
there really not much else say . perhaps i review hex nut next . ; -	1
according photo magazine , this cosmetically re-labelled konica minolta 75-300 ( ) zoom telephoto , which lens i own ( it certainly looks exactly same km 75-300 lens , but ' sony ' name ) . which case , i following review : ( 1 ) excellent construction quality , this very nicely made lens , excellent finish , not too heavy but solid without ' plastic ' feel many medium-priced lenses ; ( 2 ) excellent optical quality , good sharpness even longest 300mm focal length where most zooms begin show poor quality ; ( 3 ) very unusual : near-zero distortion throughout entire range focal lengths ( very different some sigma zooms i own , which conspicuously visible pincushion distortion ) . this may well lowest-distortion 75-300 telephoto any maker . ( 4 ) one caveat : autofocus low light : my minolta maxxum 7 film camera , whose autofocus system apparently quite similar sony alpha 100 , camera difficulty autofocussing 75-300 lens 300 mm setting ( where aperture only f/ 5.6 ) light weaker than direct sunlight . this probably same any f/ 5.6 or slower lens . i found myself switching manual focus 300 mm setting if subject not brightly lit . note : konica minolta 75-300 ( ) lens still available , $140 , reportedly work sony alpha 100 just well similar lens labelled sony	-1
extremely impressed tz3 . this gem should get 5 stars construction finish alone . just holding it your hands it screams quality feels like tank . love it . it seriously feels like $700 camera . no exaggeration . i little worried it not able fit my jean pockets before buying it . women may issues really tight jeans but us guys no problem . it fits fine . i seriously cant believe i carry around camera 10x zoom inside my jean pockets . truly remarkable . 3 " screen amazing . you practically enjoy your pics right screen w/o even printing them high res output . navigation so easy this camera . something not surprising though if your already coming panny ( fz7 here ) . picture quality great . i tested it out today standard i would say its just good my fz7 daylight better lowlight ( indoors ) . image quality great , if you need extra sharpness you could always use camera " vivid mode " or add little some post processing . pics standard natural mode pp very well . wide angle something new me . took some neat shots looked very nice extra viewing angle . very distinctive after this i'm not sure if i could go back . if your looking it all camera this may very well your tool choice . combine it extreme versatility coupled excellent image quality , superb lens , build , finish you yourself winner .	1
i came off canon powershot s40 , little 4-megapixel brick camera gave me 4 years excellent results . my first digital camera after closet-full film nikons . many buffs claim 4 megapixels all you need , i made number nice looking a3 prints . now i 7 megapixels work , i see i wrong : four not enough . seven wonderful.dpreview.com points out strongly above iso 200 noise real problem -- but you always wonder just how picky they . well not too picky this case . using higher than 200 setting ( i.e. , most indoor flash shots ) resulted lot noise , making camera almost unusable except simplest 4 6 snapshots . but i take almost entirely outdoor shots -- scenics candids . i set iso 100 get gorgeous results . it taken some getting used different color rendition tz3 my canon . canon seems more balanced while tz3 caused reddish orange really pop out . there something cool ( color temperature-wise , not " fashionable " ) color not entirely fixed photoshop . sometimes result marvelous , especially shots cloudy or rainy days . other times they not so great . so i playing around various settings --" natural " " vivid . " " vivid " closer what i want right out camera , but less easy spruce up . " natural " easier modify , so setting i am using now . i pleasantly surprised how small tz3 : it slips easily into pants pocket ( but not shirt pocket ) . zoom lens stating decent wide-angle ( 28mm ) utterly fantastic really makes camera stand out head shoulders pack . thus , i am delighted choice . however , answer my question " what more could i want ? " , here it : 1 . selection disk always moves when i pocket camera , so i always check , when i pull it out , rest desired setting . its detents need strengthened . 2 . back side controls too easy activate accidentally when shooting one-handed fleshy part thumb . headache because you then need press " select " get back operation . 3 . dpreview right when they moan venus iii sensor . it good but , otherwise sensational camera like this one , not good enough	-1
not best ui ( easy figure out , but not intuitive slightest ) , but picture looks great ( comparitively ) low resolution . scaling algorithm good job taking high-res pictures making them look pretty sharp low-res screen . super bright display ! i impressed . never ran it batteries so i can't speak battery life , but ac adapter , it run all day	-1
this best accessory i every bought any electronic device . it worked perfectly , already small size camera , it still pretty small able go swimsuit pocket . even my wife loved it . we went snorkeling , swimming , water slides it took great pictures video . well worth money !!	1
i bought this my carribean cruise , it fits like glove . i wanted buy one canon sd500 after i saw one cabo baja unlimited	1
we early digital camera adopters so this model now our 5th or 6th camera . requirement us when we buy digital camera availabilty underwater housing since we use these camera during scuba trips . we larger sony dsc-f707 amphibico housing which great job us but requires crate when we take it diving . this camera purchased sony brand underwater housing which tiny neatly organized so entire package very compact travel . sony made some significant improvements their underwater housings since first generation including double o-rings ability support deepest recreational dives . camera housing fit tiny backpack easily goes under airplane seat . serious underwater photography you require heaps external light i'm not fan sony underwater lighting solution but other choices exist . my favorite things camera large 2.5 " screen which allows me easily see which shots i want keep . small , thin light size also makes it easy use . big selling feature me 640x480 30 fps mpeg movie capability so we email clips people actually see . docking station makes sure it always charged ready . i've very pleased battery life . far " cons " go there few . i would like see better flash ( which seems case most digital cameras ) more than 3x optical zoom . again , larger zoom seems improbable camera this size . land , unit bit inconvenient use tripod since it must docking station mount . i consider all these minor since my primary goal small underwater-capable camera would 640x480 mpegs bright 5.1 mp shots . me , sony met those goals small form factor attractive price .	1
this camera my second digital camera . it very nice far price picture goes . pictures come out very clear but you would need get sd card because internal memory not hold more than 10 pictures . functions simple ready use . there single-button video function takes long videos audio . you also add audio still photos . downside this camera it uses lot battery . not use store-bought regular alkaline batteries it drain within 25-30 shots w/ flash . please use least 2200 mah rechargeable battery . when using rechargeable batteries , you find you get least 150 200 shots , no problem . still , camera battery drainer . also , camera only tells you low battery when it low battery . there no battery scale lcd screen so you not know when you would need new batteries . lcd enough regular use view pictures but i find it somewhat fuzzy quality compared transferring photos viewing computer . flash recycle time longer than others may not able take multiple shots within 10 seconds .	-1
i m417 nearly year now nothing but best say . first digital camera i ever found it so easy take photos , transfer photos , print them . i found friends families cameras too complex bothered , but m417 simple operate quality excellent . if you can't bothered take photography course still want great photos , buy m417	-1
i just love this camera ! quality photos videos excellent . battery life never problem all . it very easy store it dock . videos great so convenient i find myself taking more videos this camera than my video camera .	1
there reviewer who stated this camera made " annoying jingle " everytime you turned it told sony technical support it unable turned off . don't let sway your opinion this buying this amazing camera because after playing around it 5 minutes , i figured out how turn it off	1
this camera fulfiled my expectations well seller who shipped it right away .	1
i bought this camera general use like it lot . compared other cameras ive owned this one very good sound recording capability . it ergonomics good its pleasant use most part . using dvd options camera could little more refined but i imagine mature future generations . i'd recommend it anyone looking dvd camcorder use family or low end presentations . bad : editing software included it rubbish requires shelling out more money right off bat if you actually want create anything reasonably professional any footage . my opinion its technical support headache waiting happen . i checked it out then threw it trash . it also not firewire which highly irritating odd considering my older canons/sonys all firewire connectivity . mac users : this means it not work imovie or final cut pro / express . since my preference using os based editing suites i finish out dvd then put it computer directly . rip footage off dvd then import it into either fcp or imovie . if only it firewire ... short : great camera , very good sound , easy use pleasant operate . clunky , out-of-box-upgrade-requiring , low-end editing software lack firewire keep it perfect little camera it should	-1
i've my web research it pointed me buy canon dc40 among other dvd-camcorders market . it such amazing experience using it capture moments during my nephew birthday party . still shots absolutely fantastic ! video like no other ... it very clear sharp . you may want tweak settings get film look versus homevideo look your video shots . also , tweak stills settings well get slr-like shots . i love this product i highly recommend this all you who planning purchasing dvd-camcorder . cheers ! -- joel pelay	1
i got this tripod so i could use quick-release plate , yeah , it real nice ..	1
i paid ~ $20 this tripod i say price , you just can't beat it . it highly adjustable , stable , nice , removable camera footings . i've used this tripod quite extensively since i bought it , it held up very nicely	1
i bought hc3 hd camcorder .. this charger because it'll charge 2 batteries .. wrong . it charge one(1 ) battery time .. it give you liinfo let you knowhow long til battery ( fast full ) .. it accurate .. it also comes cable goes camcorder .. so .. you run camera charge batteries same time same unit .. sony good this unit . very satisfied .	1
just clarify few other differences gs500 gs300 besides those mentioned review below . gs500 indeed offer additional mp still shots ( 4.0 mp ) 12x zoom , but that not all ... it also bigger longer lens , 1/ 4.7 " ccd ( 1070k 3 pixels ) sensors instead 1/6 " ccd ( 800k 3 pixels ) gs300 . filter diameter 43mm instead 37mm . gs500 aperture range 1.6 f16 opposed gs300 1.8 f16 . this all may not make huge difference , but optics technically bit better gs500 , low light ability rated more sensitive too -- minimum 5 lux vs . 12 lux gs300 . gs500 also offers manual focus ring lens ( gs300 " manual , " but it operated through lcd menu/joystick ) , actual hot ( opposed cold gs300 ) shoe mounted accessories such lights or microphones . gs500 procinema shooting mode , designed give widescreen footage " film " appearance . gs300 doesn't . gs500 not automatic lens cap gs300 -- toss up auto bit more convenient , but more noisey . gs500 also real door memory card instead rubber cover over port gs300 . panasonic lists weights gs500 3.17 lbs vs . 2.98 gs300 -- hardly big difference . finally , there also " freestyle " remote addition regular remote gs500 -- this plug remote useful when camera tripod , doesn't come gs300 . course both models no longer available retailers , but these days price difference used models more like $250-300 , so consider well ... despite all i've said , i ended up getting gs300 myself . unfortunately , panasonic 3ccd dv camcorders decline since gs400/250 , currently there no successor gs500 only gs320 currently left panasonic 3ccd/mini dv category . gs320 loses few key features gs300 ( like external mic ) , doesn't touch gs500 . perhaps panasonic get clue introduce good hd mini dv camera one day ..	-1
i've this camcorder since nov . used it several times . i love exploring features playing around its different uses . it takes excellent video excellent color sound . i've also successfully transferred video my computer which easy . i love this camcorder clear video it makes my family	1
i bought camera present this great addition . very nice looking case ; stylish reasonably priced . not bulky all . highly recommend	1
i am used using vertical grips all my other nikons . this adds extra shutter release zoom control camera . it also adds bulk give camera better balance your hand . only problem i've encountered losing screws hold tripod mount . they just backed out field i super glue it . camera apparently discontinued , hence ultra-low price base . camera useful backup , although i purchased it something replacement heavier 35mm systems field . i am still using it , but only back up d80 , which excellent camera works all my nikon lenses ( i ordered base it too ! ) i just ordered extra mb-cp11 carry quick switches . price makes it wonderful buy	-1

when i first got my camera , i tried save money getting generic ' equivalent ' battery . big mistake . after fully charging it , camera would take few pictures before showing low battery . i kept shooting anyway , just see what would happen . it didn't turn off , but i noticed side camera became much hotter than when shooting canon brand battery . i tossed generics bought real one , no trouble since . don't try cheap ; go directly name brand .	1
i've bought three different nb-3l aftermarket batteries my canon sd500 none them actually function properly ... they indicate fully charged but when put into camera they immediately show " discharged-replace battery pack " . i even bought aftermarket charger thinking might problem ... same result . i've given up 3rd-party batteries , i'll get this canon brand unit lick my wounds . ( yes , canon overpriced but since they seem engineered camera only work their own batteries i'm kind stuck ... anyone else this problem ?	-1

best quality light tent market . it extremely hard me retire my home made light box but i decided give photo light tents try . i remembered few years back , home made light tents made abs pipe nylon pretty common among product photographers . rave reviews products such plastic domes , housings nothing but pile super expensive junk . not mention setting it up pain butt some how cleaver marketing pushed out bunch these junks . this not case xpro photography light tent . not only it performs better than my home made tent , it easily folded stored small carrying pouch comes tent . sweeten up deal , 2 backdrops included package . i recommend xpro light tents people who trading selling jewelry , glassware , or highly reflective products online . it also recommended photographers specialize product catalog photography . xpro light tent easy use even amateurs start taking product photos like pros	1

bag solidly made . i am using it my iway 500c gps . it fits snuggly into main compartment . really heavy touch screen unit , i needed best padding i could get . walls bag firm , thick soft ( yes , all same time ) . side pockets very useful accessories . detachable storage bag base unit used separately . it sizable , but provides little protection contents , so it nto good fragile items . detaching reattaching straightforward , but takes minute accomplish . you would not want re-attach/detach this compartment daily basis . if you camera accessories you take vacation , but generally want leave your room or vehicle - it perfect	1
my original sd500 psc 50 leather case both stolen during burglary . since they gifts my girlfriend i tried replace exact items . after buying leather case , however , i suspect canon made versions better quality leather . my original case seemed made much higher grade leather . it more smooth elegant than one i just purchased . even small metal ' canon powershot ' emblem front made different kind metal ( not brushed steel like original ) . said , case fantastic . i personally would not care extra pocket/space battery or memory card , instead am driven what most compact stylish . ( but then again , when it comes traveling this case fits inside very nice lowe case i massive canon slr .	1

i canon s40 several years it always worked flawlessly yielding great pictures . however , i want upgrade it more modern camera . unfortunately , s80 discontinued apparently without any replacemnet e.g. s90 works . i then purchased used s80 . it great camera markedly improved over my old s80 . large lcd screen , wider zoom range , smaller size , improved movie mode major changes . i always keep it case when not use , like prior reviewer would pleasantly surprised if it not damaged dropping	1
why this going $899 ???? it listed $400 walmart online .	1
i realy enjoy this camera . what most impresses me charge time very fast . it good quality camera price . i don't care lower reviews , like anything there few lemons out there , but don't let discourage you . i realy recommend this one	-1
course like any person who spends 300 bucks something you expect it perform admirably , while knowing full well there more expensive models out there . this little dv camera quite job . starting packing all way down technical features . world you get less less jvc seems pretty well . instructions camera come 3 languages , all peripherals ; lens cap , multi-voltage power plug , rca cables , straps actually well designed usable . camera itself quite user friendly , intuitive . after opening sorting contents i camera up recording less than 5 minutes . pros : 1 . very fast rewind fast forward . 2 . light weight , compact . 3 . clear display you turn flip almost every direction4 . great zoom features very good recording quality . cons : 1 . no dv tape included . i smart enough pick up two pack same time . 2 . if you big hands it may little hard manipulate . 3 . although i didn't buy tripod , it looks if you can't eject tape while camera attached . would i buy it again ? absolutely	-1
this item terrific its intended purpose - small reminders good memories you carry you . other reviews indicated , though , not expect awesome picture quality . sentimental value not diminished , though	-1
first thing everyone comments seeing this scope then learning what i paid it : " wow- that lot scope bucks ! " . indeed , it got all attachments well rounded amateur scope not only star gazing , but also terrestrial viewing . included accessories all 1.25 " diameter , : ( 1 ) star diagonal ( 90 degree angle adaptor ) . ( 2 ) 20mm eyepiece . ( 3 ) 4mm eyepiece . ( 4 ) 3x barlow lens . ( 5 ) 1.5 erecting eyepiece terrestrial viewing . ( 6 ) 5x24 finderscope .

like this little thing . i especially impressed half-pressed shutter button , just like actual camera . half-pressing gives camera time focus , full press takes shot . seems very sturdy , zoom telephoto nice touch . i personally like clip , but i guess it would nice if it removable . only reason i give this 4 , it petty , i thought it would cool include jog-dial dscf717 use manual setting , or change focus area .	-1
i ordered accessory kit my sony dsp 200 . after carrying camera around its own while , kit pleasure use . camera fits snugly there room accessories . all feels safe secure . handy days shooting , but there no room cables/cradles , etc , things you keep suitcase . if you're going get spare battery anyway , price pretty good too	1
not all permafocus binoculars this good , but these fantastic . if you tire easily adjusting focus , you won't believe your eyes when you look through these . i used these lake , baseball games golf course . my son dropped pair concrete misaligned one lens . luckily i already purchased pair just return car get them . i am writing this review because i am looking buy yet pair . buy enjoy ! you'll glad you ! besides , this price , what you got lose ?	1
i've using sony handycam work so far it working out pretty well . i'm not manual reader like things work right out box . working knowledge these new gadgets today , it relatively easy get it started . i'm able export directly my computer or create dvd only one touch button ( although i haven't this yet ) . i like it , it easy use , light weight 30 gb hard drive so it never runs out space . only drawback i'm often trying figure out where connectors camera . i'm figuring it out though	-1

i purchased camera case gift ( camera ) my wife , first case seemed too small her canon powershot sd 630 , flap would not secure , but leather soon stretched now it works fine . overall construction seems good solid it really got thorough workout recent vacation . now everything works really well . overall , leather case good product , but some minor pitfalls . since fit so tight you really careful not get sand , or any other debris , case it scratch screen we ours . scratches prevented screen protector , but we couldn't find one before vacation started . other shortcoming strap . it real hassle re-feed strap through hole case every time we finished camera strap also not long enough leave case camera connected . we ended up using original canon strap not red leather strap because it fit under flap better . most importantly , case fashionable makes child-bride very happy , indeed	-1
i research daylights out everything . so i wind up usually buying menage names since i don't believe any manufacturer good everything . since my college days mid-80s , i've hated sony products . i've always believed they waded into far too many product lines their quality suffered . so , up until this purchase i've owned nothing sony 20 years . based reviews , though , i just purchased this camcorder broke it during trip berlin . you cannot beat price quality . superb zoom ( optical really counts digital blurs picture artificial ) , easy menu , great night shot capability . all all , wonderful purchase . not hesitate buy this sony . tip : get pack dvd+rws play since you re-record get pack dual layer rs once you're comfortable because they much more recording space but you cannot re-record them	1

i bought this tripod after mistakenly purchased 480rm which much shorter . 580rm sturdier carrying case much better quality . controls handle handy camcorder while they prove useless ( mainly zoom button ) dsc-f828 since it manual zoom/focus ring . only problem we ( it seems more camera ) dsc-f828 causes entire tripod head tilt one side due design camera ( lens barrel not centered ) . you would've thought tripod would able handle off-center weights specially sony products . end day , it excellent companion our camera camcorder . would've given 5-stars if not ' tilt ' problem	-1

i purchased this case my new dsc-t10 it looks great , quality leather fits 2 inch belt very snug , which equates very good carrying case . you cannot even tell it your belt magnetic kepper strap works well . there room stuff extra memory stick if you need , but no room additional battery . i guess u gotta give up something sleek styling =) i haven't needed my second stick yet , since i purchased 1 gb 512 mb , if i , i just put it my pants pocket	-1
this battery comes standard panasonic pv-gs35 camcorder . it provides few hours service each charge , even lcd use " stop go " recording playback . it superior most other standard camcorder batteries . naturally , many electronic devices , you want backup battery so you keep recording - there no need spend $75 or more different backup or more powerful one . this one great backup , or primary , battery under $60	1
i bought this frame my wife . she alot digital pictures no good way see them all . after reading reviews others , i decided try this one . she loves it . little card reader we our computer , she drag drop her photos sd card . then just plug card , hook up ac power , turn frame . it goes slide show automatically . we didn't bother re-size or crop photos . 1/2 " black bars each side photo just aren't bothersome us . no remote controls or sound features but if you're looking simple frame just show off all your digital photos , reasonable price , this one great	1

now i've used camera few months i'd like update my review ( scroll down see original ) . problem i mentioned using camera bright sunlight easily fixed increasing screen brightness . battery life great , far better than my last camera rechargeable aas . camera super easy use gives great pictures . example , i frequently change modes depending lighting feature easily accessed button top camera , not through series menus . friends impressed you zoom video mode , something there cameras cannot , built help screens . used panorama feature recent trip vancouver simple use gave great results . i highly recommend this camera its size , features , ease use . original : i'm really enjoy my new r817 . it easy use buttons all right places . menus use easy follow . friends i've showed it all liked feel ease use without no dials . i bought it size zoom i'm not disappointed . like all cameras without view finder , it hard see screen when shooting into direct sunlight , my only negative . also bought quick charger extra battery case like case . looked new nikon l1 , but one bestbuy broken so i no idea how it works . i figured this not good sign	1
it lasts same original battery panasonic . excellent option price/quality . seller fulfilled treaty	1
i bought this battery backup my panasonic lumix fz3 ; specifically shoot 90min plus soccer games . overall this great battery i am happy my purchase . i've owned it almost year now no complaints . battery performs up standards panasonic battery came my camera . it lasts long panasonic battery , charges up fine ; overall good battery especially money	1
i this lens half-a-year now . pricy , course , but it worth it . it allowed me take some pretty interesting pictures which would not taken any other way . most time it necessary when you `shoot ' animals , e.g. birds , or butterflies , who would not allow you get close . example shoot alligator , where he probably would not mind , but i . then , some architectural shots big distance also become possible . vr ( vibration reduction ) totally amazing . thing , however , eats batteries lunch , so i've started carry second battery . lens comes nice cylindrically shaped bag , because it pretty big heavy , i carry it it original bag , instead trying stick it into same bag camera , so load spread . course , you really need love this type shooting carry it around . overall , lens miracle modern technology , quality exceptional . this great fun , if money allow - i highly recommend .	1
i bought this my 8 year old she loves it . its easy use . she her friends take pictures it all time . she even dropped it few times it still works no problem . pictures movies aren't great but good enough . i wouldn't get it my main camera though . its really more toy	-1

i bought this camera start my production business it best move i could made . this camera great beginner like me . it user friendly while still allowing ajustments . hd also amazing , my customers there videos hd absolutely floored we they get their finished product . few things i recommend getting tripod well extended battery . stock battery only provides 45 min lcd if you add anything other then shotgun mic it lowers it even more . make sure you use only high quality tapes . ( i found out hard way ) good tapes this camera going cost $10 $15 but they worth it when you reduce time re-tape due drop-out film . all together this me great camera price . anything better going run you $8000 or more	1
problem trying extend emitter " blink back " led . due my errors polarity i problems . tried resolve e-mail . marcus sent me unit i still could not get it work ! then i called direct phone number marcus gave me ... problem solved !! if only 10% suppliers responsive this company , world would much better place . also , hot link pro works advertised my case life saver !	1

i'm beginner who still wanted longer reach this lens offered . difference this 70-200mm lens amazing , especially when effective zoom equivalent more than 300mm -- more like 450mm , i'm told . only complaint length time it took amazon get this product me . it arrived my house while i vacation , getting 70-200mm lens cursing my bad fortune	-1
i just recently got nikon d40 christmas , i wanted get nice zoom lens would suit my needs , well really inexpensive , i think this lens fits " " . contrary popular belief , this af-g lens work new nikon d40 , only thing it not autofocus . which isnt big deal really . i rated this lens 5 because it takes amazing pictures . i love it . you really cant beat this lens price .	1
i love this camera . what it -- it works great ! it ultra-compact fits anywhere -- coat or pants pocket -- pistol-grip style make it handy shoot stuff without missing action . this makes it super-convenient traveling -- where you don't end up spending so much time looking through eyepiece you miss enjoying view yourself . mp3 player comes handy long plane flights . no , it not hd camera it shoots poorly under low light conditions . price -- i pleased happy shots it took . i'd love see higher quality version this , too . but it not garbage like some other reviewers stated . it some nice features ( price !! ) some limitations . so if it fits your uses -- get one . you'll glad you . best things this camera/camcorder : -it works great daylight/outdoor conditions-it super compact-it let you point shoot pistol-grip style ( so you enjoy what you're viewing)-it ideal video that going straight web ( it uses avi , mov , asf)-you replace aaa batteries whenever you want/need -- not proprietary battery requires special charger , handy when you travel countries outside us-you replace memory cards when they fill up ( i think cheapest place get them amazon)-it doesn't attract attention itself like large camcorders flashing led recording lights-it nice mp3 player , camera , camcorder , audio recorder all-in-one -- truly multimedia recording devicebut , also beware there some things it doesn't really well ... -it really only works daylight/bright light conditions ( don't even try shooting outdoors night)-the flash doesn't really work unless you're shooting within 3 ' subjec t-t he battery lens cover plastic wear out if heavily used/misused-there no external mic jack-the menu mp3 player limited-the manual somewhat lacking print really small	-1
i own this 3ccd one 1 year . i 2 , 1 jvc 1 panasonic . they not working indoor most time because dark bad light . however , this 3ccd one makes real difference . i am more than happy it . only problem poor still image quality although it says 2mb resolution . but i always use dedicated digial camera , so not big deal me	1
am very pleased this purchase . very fast service shipping . shop amazon again . found this camera easy setup operate . takes great stills movies . thank yo	1
yes , this great camera , many these depth reviews show , however bundled software incompatible windows xp service pack 2 , which makes editing impossible operating sytem not recognize hardware because sony drivers haven't passed logos tests . after spending hours phone troubleshooting it turns out sony drivers not service pack 2 approved they've nothing release updated compatible downloads their website which would solve problem . so i lodged complaint am considering getting rid handycam it not very handy when you can't edit anything . basically it great camera but software plagued compatibility issues not user friendly . i am really upset i spent this much camcorder claims compatible my system it turns out it not , it would seem it would not very hard sony release updated driver would fix this problem . shame you sony .	-1
others said it : this all around very good camera . it got decently sized sensor ( 4.1 mp ) , 3x optical zoom not big wow , but most film point-and-shoots come no zoom all . lcd viewfinder decently sized , though more expensive ones , course , bigger . video mode great it good thing av cable quick share . if you average sub-average picture-taker , like me , you most probably not tripod around , so alone guarantee you blurry shots sub optimal lighting conditions , unless you use flash . so most enhanced scene modes , including nightime modes also manual control mode most probably get blurry results . good thing camera tell you when your shot would prone " shake " blur . way you decide either not take shot , adjust lighting conditions or get ( if you one ) tripod . it sturdy camera . it over year old survived least one major fall , some bumps here there . only thing i've noticed lately pictures turning up slight greenish feel them . i'm pretty avid photoshop know how correct pics get them lifelike colors , difference isn't bad . not many people notice it , but i , maybe since i like edit photos very much . end , if you don't alot money want get most " bang your buck " , go this one - specially if you just starting digital camera world i moment purchase	1
i like camera , but dont remote control , not its so much important me . i used indoor quality poor , but its amazin color outdoor , fact mp4 its very funciolannly !! if you like upload videos youtube . this camera you	-1
cameras great . good seller , fast shipping . come box , new condition . i am satisfy product	1
i bought this camera few days ago purpose going travelling . this camera great . while i could bought 7 or 8 mp camera , there really no point ; this camera 5mp easily blown up a4 size ... who needs larger than ? i find battery not last long , so i bought 2 spare . ( shop around cheap prices though ... sony wanted charge au$70 ( us$50 ) or so ' np-fe1 ' ' infolithium battery ' , but i found website sold them only au$24 ( us$18) ! lcd screen seems drain lot power , but who really uses their viewfinder now anyway ? sound quality video mode not best , but still legible . all all , this great camera . i would recommend it anyone just wanting small camera great quality travels well .	1
this wonderful camera ! i got it christmas ' 05 . i took somewhere close 6,000 pictures it . digic ii processor it beast ! you could just take photo after photo after photo it . very little shutter lag , maybe just smidge . bunch helpful modes making it very easy use . my only complaint though mine died suddenly , just wouldn't start one day ! no amount charging or monkeying would bring it back life . i believe it some sort lens error , but i really won't ever know . handed it customer service , looked it , told me it broke i needed buy new one . upsetting ..	-1

i am very pleased sony vct680rm tripod it joy use price affordable	-1
i bought this tripod video tapping upcomming family wedding tried it couple times get used it . i like smooth operation controls handle . panning operation likewise acceptable . telescopic locking legs work well , but light weight rock little during panning . lightness also plus because it collapses into small over shoulder bag easy toteing . one hand tripod stabilization one control handle during panning works well .	-1
i love this camera . color great , so fun makes me feel unique . screen great size , it takes great pictures . good red eye issue . menu great too , when you scroll thru things , it tells you what it so you don't memorize it all . takes fast pictures , but not one after , like i hoping . but it open fast . don't fooled big memory , you still need larger card . depending size pic you want , you take 30 50 pics memory alone . but all all i love this camera it great buy	-1
i bought this present my wife . i looking something she could carry her purse . automatic functions easy functional . it not enthusiasts camera : too hard get into menus . screen easy turn off(this sucks battery power ) . it even optical viewfinder(a rare finding lately ) optical viewfinder helps get steady pictures those us shakes . pictures clear colors excellent . drawback sony batteries cost arm leg . wire downloading pix multifunctional very proprietary(read expensive if you lose it	1
i've this camera two months now i really like it . fact it image stabilization means i yet take blurry picture . also , zoom quite impressive . nifty feature you overlay grid help photo composition(the " rule thirds " ) . only caveat this camera lack optical viewfinder , so you can't really turn off lcd save battery power . i never batteries die out me , so i don't really consider it problem , although you may	1
i got this camera when price it took nosedive . i found i wasn't carrying my powershot s2 around outdoors much because size issue . this one i bring anywhere . picture quality low iso just good best superzoom cameras , leica lens gives very clear rendition any scene . build quality fantastic , solid metal large , bright high resolution screen . focus times decent , par other superzooms . lens hardly extends outward all , folded optics really shrink footprint camera . however ..... shooting indoors or high iso issue entirely . noise big problem above iso 100 . flash pathetically weak . iso 80 , flash only rated around 3 feet ! this not camera indoors or low light . movie mode decent , but nothing write home . widescreen 848x480 mode interesting , but overall quality couple steps down powershot s2 or s3 . sound especially weak comparison . positive note , you zoom during filming . tz line cameras designated " travel " . if you plan using this camera ( well lit outdoors ) , it great choice . all one solution , i can't fully recommend it .	-1
this cute little perfect camera . other than fact ccd base assembly needed replacement after few months ( generating lens cap error even though it not place ) , it always excellent camera . far ccd , just call 800 number mentioned above , give them your serial number other pertinent info you're set . i live near factory cypress i camera back one week ! that service ! it free	-1
please go into this purchase knowing you aren't going get quality $ 1,000 camera $350 i think you pleased . yes , some things annoying like led lights spotlight focused small area " night mode " slowing down shutter so it choppy . but compared previous canon i owned , it great . low light shooting much better even out light , colors much more vibrant distinct . i burn my movies dvd difference this jvc my canon substantial . there very little no pixelation or rough dithering low light jvc . it somewhat grainy but all cams low light . drivers not working , mentioned some reviews , xp pro xp home both recognized cam soon i plugged it driver disk wasn't even needed . i work company sells consumer electronics 70% returns we get not because product defective , but because user can't figure it out . go retailer who least 14 day return policy try it out . if you don't like it , return it try something else . just don't expect corvette performance chevette price you'll happy this .	-1

sony alpha a100k best camera i ever owned . images nothing short spectacular . lens mount allows you use telephoto lenses other camera . i expensive telephoto lens my old 35mm minolta it fit this sony digital perfectly . you notice lot minolta features this sony since minolta left camera business . image stabilization feature makes it real hard mess up shot . if you beginner or pro , this camera easy use perfect pictures every time	1
echoing what most others said , this great camera . it dream use , pictures stunning . since it based minolta design , it accepts lenses my old minolta maxxum 9000 ( circa mid 1980s ) . this huge benefit me ; i now excellent quality 70-210mm zoom lens my new alpha-100 no additional cost ! auto-focus ttl metering work properly , since anti-shake hardware camera body , works old lens also . even my old minolta cable release ( switch end electrical cable proprietary rectangular plug ) connects works fine . i'm very happy camera . said , there couple annoyances . one them might significant you , depending how you want use camera . first , noise . not picture noise , grainy low-light photos , but acoustic noise . shutter mechanism * loud * , much louder than my old maxxum 9000 . if you want unnoticed photographer taking discreet pictures like cartier-bresson his leica , this isn't your camera . second , lens shade . this nit , but i find it more clumsy use than lens shade old camera . old one held spring clasp ; you just squeeze opposite sides install or remove it , or reverse it storage . new one positioned precisely so tabs lock into place when it turned . not quick or easy use , but not really big deal . i suppose it saved couple dollars , new one one piece plastic while old one several parts . whole , excellent product . i'd buy it again heartbeat	1
great camera , no wonder it named " camera year " . fast , clear accurate describe camera photos it produces . i camera month it all i expected . super steady feature truly gives two stops . kit lens useful quite bargin . i use it more than i thought i would . i truly get same feel results i my old maxxium slr	1
this camera made picture taking easy fun again . only thing missing case/carrier	1
there reason why this camera rated number 1 amazon . i highly suggest buying it ; it easy use quality wonderful . get 2gb memory card , it worth extra few bucks , you never need delete pics again	1
i took this camera week long trip florida . i never lost charge made over 1.5 gbs content this camera . video camera not slr . please not expect professional quality images this camera . however if you want shot video , this camera you . buy 1gb memory card start shooting your favorite family moments . i suggest using 640x480 mode so your video dvd quality . zoom ... video zoom great . i shot some offroad video my jeep able easily zoom over 100 ft away jeep while shoting . i never installed camera software my windows xp based pc . instead i used secure digital memory card reader pulled files card . $145 this video camera replaced my mustek dv4500 . i threw this camera around , ran it battery down let it sit black jeep sun two days . after i all this camera still running . controls camera not complicated like other video cameras this genre either . all this said , one could make case cheap camera like this could easily used younger generation , easily . pros : 1 ) 640x480 video recording seamless excellent audio streaming . 2 ) long battery life ( held charge 1.5 gbs worth pictures video recording)3 ) video stabilization really make video smoother . 4 ) take 1gb memory cards5 ) if you wait 1/4 second , 5mp photos come out well camera no real lens . 6 ) best image quality any solid state video camera this genre . cons : 1 ) poor flash photography2 ) images : shutter lag over 1/4 second . 3 ) battery charging requires removal battery . update 9/7/2006 : i am still using camera . i keep it my jeep during hot louisiana days , no problems . i really like quick boot time camera ; 5 seconds or less . i instantly shot video or take picture press button	-1
price $130 , this great little camera . course , it not going good 400-600 dollar cameras but beginners or people who just want use it some fun easy clips pictures , i would highly recommend it . i am 12 years old this camera works excellently me but if you looking long term professional camera , spend extra money buy better one . it simple use good ages around 11-14 . :	1
it pleasent surprise , because camera smaller than i thought . easy use , light night shots audio good ... i definetly would reccomend it	-1
i recently purchased rebel t2 camera body only after my canon eos rebel 2000 gave its " last gasp " . i canon user since 1979 ae-1 ( i still ) . i liked fact t2 body plugged immediately into two ef lenses i owned ( 28-80mm 75-300mm ) , which protected my previous investments . i taking pictures within seconds opening package loading batteries . although i my sights set digital rebel some point soon , you just can't beat quality traditional 35-mm film photoprocessing . upgrade over eos rebel 2000 , lcd located camera back easier read . also , t2 seems more " solid " me , but lighter weight . i took older eos rebel 2000 me couple 75-mile backpacks ( which probably led its early demise ) , so i now new-found respect lighter design . final note , i also appreciated ease ordering via amazon.com . there plenty web sites offering same canon t2 camera back , including those which would saved me few dollars . but none long-standing relationship i amazon over past several years	1

once while truly good bargain comes . finepix f20 such bargain . course , there better cameras cameras more features but not f20 price . it not camera meet everyone needs , but it excellent camera . addition its quality construction , it features : 6.3 megapixels , fuji new ccd sensor , iso 2000 sensitivity , dual shot mode ( with/without flash ) , 15 scene modes , good battery life , quick response times , bright 2.5 inch lcd , more . there some manual features but no manual conrols aperture shutter speed no viewfinder . all these features would mean nothing if it didn't take good photos . some photos taken this camera ( particularly low light photos ) stunning . i don't see how you could go wrong this camera today prices . only negatives me xd memory card no viewfinder . however , those minor nothing perfect	1

all previous reviewers who gave this camera 1 star , i only guess they far too high expectations or tried dropping it eiffel tower then take picture it ... this camera incredibly durable , survived many drops , good enough picture quality my family members brought it several overseas trips used its pictures powerpoint . summary -- pros : - good picture quality , not grainy- takes smooth video , although no sound- flash illuminates dark scenes wellcons : - if you take too many pictures fast succession , it take several seconds " recover " . - zoom rapidly degrades picture quality -- but that expected digital zoom . - you install software go through fancy picture transfer process , whereas most cameras simply show up removable disk my computer when you connect them . pro/con : - mac-friendly/pc-unfriendly . movie files quicktime . mov format rather than good old universal avi	1

i purchased this unit after i bought my canon zr25mc digital camcorder . i used it often when filming sporting events action , adjustable resistance offers fluid movement when trying follow action if you speed up , camera not jerk ( long tension set high enough ) . i recently bought canon g2 digital still well . again , extendable height proved usefull get good view group shot , or even landscape or two . it light enough i cary it hooked onto my camera bag ( probably around 3 pounds ) when i hike take pictures mountains . it not too stable uneven terrain , but really it not designed kind work anyway it seems . overall it served me well , i think someone looking inexpensive ( virtually disposable ) tripod would well this model	-1

soy un principiante en esto de la fotografia , esta ha sido mi primera camara slr , por lo tanto me ha tocado experimentar con ella para obtener las mejores tomas posibles la vez que han aumentado mis conocimientos en el area , el desempe�o es excelente tanto en tomas fijas como las que he realizado objetos en movimiento , tanto sus funciones automaticas como las profesionales ofrecen un desempe�o excelente , he tomado mas de 300 fotos en poco menos de cuatro meses , el zoom que tiene es rapido , los botones tienen una disposicion excelente para manejarla con una sola mano , lo unico que necesita es un flash de la serie speedlite , tuve oportunidad de conseguir uno prestado de un amigo el cambio fue estupendo ya que este tiene mas alcance para el lente que la camara trae , ya que el flash que trae carece de potencia el cual ofrece su mejor desempe�o en los 28mm del lente(no le podemos pedir mas un flash integrado ) , por ultimo les dijo que posee el mejor sistema de medicion de luz que existe en el mercado ( e-ttl)y esta disponible tanto con flash integrado como con el flash externo	1
picture quality exceptional it very easy use . so much nicer than punching screen menus like sony 405 . who wants worry finger prints scratches all over screen those touch screens ? it also priced better than sony 405 . we researched these cameras lot before settling panasonic , picture quality our #1 objective . we more than pleased our purchase !!	1
i reviewed many dvd camcorders over 4-5 month period feel this best choice . i almost purchased sony dvd405 , but color one first priorities my list wants this new camcorder . although sony better chip , fact panasonic , 3 chips , according many reviews i read better color . ease use nice also . finalizing dvd takes only few minutes not really big deal , my only issue so far fade control which requires operator select it via joystick control each time you want use it . selecting this control while recording requires steady hand so camera not shake . none less , it puts my eleven year old , 8mm camcorder shame . love taking videos again	-1
i received hv20 yesterday after charging battery i hit woods . i wanted see how well it worked cloudy day outdoors . it surpassed what i expected picture quality . i also tried it dark basement corner under normal lighting inside . dark corner needs additional light hv20 . 100 watt bulb turned it really surprised me . detail far better than what i expected . reason i gave it 4star rating power switch cap hdmi plug . both not very well thought out my opinion . my point quality hd outstanding when i played film back i heard birds singing i not notice woods . sound outstanding !! i agree one other review power switch hard operate . retrospect if you want excellent quality hd picture i would recommend canon hv20 . after all it excellent picture reasonable price high definition camcorder . i would think , what most people want consumer camcorder . i viewed film my 42 " 50 " plasma tv ( sharp tack ) 04/12/07 i used my hv20 over easter holiday more impressed . my outdoor shots it better any camcorder i . inside it took outstanding video no external video light attached . still photos i took good one first 3 mega pixel digital camera i use . i purchased it video alone , but it nice quality still photo too .	-1
considering what most people buy this , including myself , it great little camera . not too large , not too small unusable . quality when hooked up hd monitor quite amazing . i switched footage shot during day cam our local hd pbs channel . i could not tell difference . this 1080i through component connection , not hdmi . i only imagine what hdmi looks like . i also like tape vs hard drive . if you go 3 week vacation somewhere , you buy tapes or bring extras instead portable hard drive storage . what i understand there less compression tapes . tapes actually get you better quality . i also use pro cameras videography miss ability constant shutter speed aperture . when pointing up my daughter against blue sky , it adjusts bright sky my daughter face gets dark . there backlight button which probably trick , but instant exposure dial would great . con , zoom rocker tiny . even my little fingers hard time zooming smoothly . i also noticed when editing , it takes more cpu even preview footage due compression . if you older machine wanting edit , just aware it may tad slower . other than few nitpicks , quality price bargain . i've waiting consumer 24p hd cam vacations long time . it arrived relatively cheap .	-1
my fujifilm f700 takes great photos , but runs low battery before you even get fill up card . i bought 650mah generic equivalent amazon seller it works great . it light enough carry around just like memory card it really easy change batteries when i need . product little pricey $40 , so buy amazon seller . if you find one cheap this must-have your camera	1

this great compact camera easy use same time capable more . viewfinder or digital display large enough see your photos . resolution great . dock wierd design , but you not use it . overall i am very pleased this camera .	-1
i am probably repeating previous comments , but : 1 . super wide angle lens nicest feature camera . no more backing into walls get everyone shot . 2 . camera doesn't handle low light situations well . i consider most indoor situations without really bright lights or large window nearby " low light " . flash handles close portrait shots ok , but everything else left something desired . no matter how steady i hold camera i get slightly blurred image . even when " blur indicator " indicates good shot , it slightly blurry computer monitor or 4x6 prints . my three-year old canon s400 yields better low light pictures . 3 . i put docking station back box after one use . charge battery directly cable included ; use card reader sd card . references flimsy sd card cover probably referring plastic hinge cover . we same type plastic hinges field surveying equipment get heavy use daily they holdup fine . i am keeping this camera throw into coat pocket/wife purse when we want travel light . i'm upgrading image stabilized canon sd800 when quality indoor pictures means mor e.p.s. check out v705 not much more $'	-1
i've xt 4.5 year now , even though i since purchased xt10 , i still use xt 4.5 more frequently because you just pick it up w/ one hand , carry it outside , begin scanning sky . even though 4.5 inch primary mirror small dobsonian telescope , this serious piece equipment money . this no cheap " department store junk " scope . perfect quick observing session , or just check quality " seeing " before you drag out " big one " . one my nephews who looked through this scope asked me what i going w/ little 4.5 now i bigger xt10 . looks like i'll buy him one his own because i'm not parting w/ mine .	1
i purchased this scope almost year ago my first scope love it . it easy use easily portable . lt ; 20 lbs it easily carried one hand using handle . it gives good views moon planets , particularly if you add barlow lense double power provided eyepieces , but also big enough ( 4.5 " ) begin show beauty deep-sky objects ( galaxies , nebulae , star clusters , etc ) . i viewed most messier deep-sky list already . because it not tripod , it also easy kids view through eyepiece because they not need get step ladder . now i am sure i really into astronomy hobby , i am ready move larger telescope , but i keep this one give it my kids so they start enjoy night sky	1

this product so cool . whatever your situation , if you lot digital pictures , then i recommend going out getting sd card ... preferably up 1gb ( or even 512mb ) , use this this product . even if your camera doesn't use sd , you plop sd card right into picture frame upload photos your computer card ! it like little computer , this frame . big suggestion i find program online resizes your photos dimensions frame ( photo size explained other reviews ) . ( i downloaded visualizer photo resize ) . this take photos down its original size ( e.g. 1.8 mb ) smaller size ( e.g. 500kb ) . this let your store dramatically more photos . so far i fit over 1700 photos 430mb worth 1gb sd card i ! picture quality very good frame swivel basically any angle could used horizontally or vertically . plus , it philips , which great brand . i philips hd tv well it my baby ... i love it . this great present anyone ! how you go wrong picture frame replaces its picture any time you want	1

i've owned printer dock plus series 3 6 months , found it make better prints than i could get my canon 960 . so i sold canon . canon inkjet inks dried up if i didn't use printer month or so , ink cartridges $12 each . kodak inks not appear dry up over extended non-use . so i'm saving bundle replacing expensive ink cartridges . i keep 8 year old epson ink jet just print 8x10 , i go ebay buy cheapest color cartridges i find which $10 color black white cartridge . it works great short term school work reports . i teach digital camera classes local schools , kodak easy share software editor universally despised loathed . don't install easy share software , if you install it , go into settings make sure it doesn't run start up . you don't need software if you just printing your camera . once this software installed , it programmed automatically try copy pictures anytime you insert device such usb , cd , dvd or camera . if you want use dock your pc printer , you just hook it up via usb cable install printer drivers . you option not installing easyshare software editor . once this hooked up , you just manually copy photos your camera memory card your pc via usb card reader , print 4x6s your favorite photo editor . if you looking photo editor print simple things like darken lighten , red eye correction , then use google picasa . it free , terrific user interface , you easily print picasa your kodak printer once printer attached your pc via usb cable . prints perfect , fast , durable , i never problem print quality . however you must order 160 pack paper amazon which get your price per print down 25 cents print . amazon very best deal this paper .	1

i recently purchased this camera when my venerable nikormat el-w developed shutter timing issues during my photo 1 class . this camera reasonably priced preformed flawlessly thus far . i shot multiple rolls ilford hp5 plus film through this camera yet exposure not come out due camera . after reading manual i able easily understand different modes how change user controlled settings . camera flash leaves little desired it rather harsh its range somewhat limited , accessory flash overcome this there other flashes operate this camera not just canon . i not opportunity shooting color film through this camera yet when i i update this review . only thing i dislike this camera there no provision remote shutter release . rebel k2 date only version this camera use remote shutter release , why canon removed this feature this model unknown remote release very handy when photographing nature or when used timer self portraits . if you any plans infrared photography not buy eos canon , frame counter uses infrared sensor cause fogging your infrared film	-1

i've this battery month or so , upon each consecutive use/charge , i'd say i'm pleased . when fully charged , camera battery indicator usually says 170-180 min total-use time ... which what it claims . it take awhile re-charge ... 2 1/2 hrs camera , but that not too bad	-1
i purchased this product my mother christmas gift , since we recently found her new digital camera ( panasonic lumix ) used only rechargable batteries . she very happy battery now doesn't wait charge it when it runs out . price also plus	1
i needed this after my dog chewed my other charger bits . this one perfect	1
given i typically use cradle transfer photos keep my battery charged , i not much need use this charger . however , it worked advertised few occasions i used it . me compactness unit flip-out plug great features	1
i bought this camera after dpreview told me it ( well , actually , its leica sibling ) fits all my needs , namely : compact , raw , aperture priority , plus optical stabilization . what i like : large screen , raw , fairly decent flashwhat i dislike : it actually takes raw + jpeg which wastes space my card . however , it gives me interesting comparison . 90% time , i prefer raw version , albeit tweaked . jpeg colors just don't look right me . i'm also unimpressed image stabilization , warranty just terrible . 90 days ??? what ? also , manual focus without viewfinder takes getting used . i won't argue there noise higher isos , but it not nearly bad i expected other reviews . i haven't decided yet whether i'm keeping camera ; if you're not hurry , hold off see if they release new version summer . course , their track record , they won't fix any problems , just squeeze few more mp out chip	-1
meets all expectations . questions noise greatly overblown . image stabilation reduces impact noise low light . people really expect get great image very low light condition ? regardless noise contrast too low get quality image except very special circumstances . up until last few years iso 400 film similar problems iso 800 virtually useless except get image . when i got this camera i took numerous pictures night inside got very good quality pictures without flash . far better than my old ditigal better than my film camera . lcd size image quality really impressive . best i seen	1
i bought this item my father christmas . he uses it his video camera . money this tripod everything average person would need . quick release great feature he didn't his old one , he likes lot . i don't know professional use , but personal use it great	1
this tripod heavy duty , allows easy adjustments many directions , holds your tripod variety angles , light folds easily . my only regret not buying $15 bag ( available seperately amazon ) same time , but i'll get my next amazon order	1
i bought this camera replace kodak easyshare 5.0 mp digital camera i ( it stolen , unfortunately ) . this model very much like previous 5.0 version . it very easy use , which i consider it strong point . process taking reviewing picture simple doesn't require user go menu screens such , some digital cameras . i like easy share software included camera . it makes downloading pictures your camera your computer quick . battery life very good too . only complaint i some pictures dim light come out little fuzzy , even flash . all all , i think it good camera money	-1
bought this one my wife . she loves it . handling look/feel impeccable . so size . shots we took great when all works : flash , focus , etc . but sometimes flash tends slow recycle shots turn out dark , previous reviewers mentioned . trick seems , don't take try take consecutive shots this thing . it what it : toy like small mug shot camera . if you want something serious , go dslrs . again , when camera work , pictures turn out great . it usual shortcomings this type cutie cameras - no view finder , vulnerable big lcd , short battery life , weak flash , so . but so all other competitors . important thing , when it works , picture quality dslr quality . it work most time , if you patient careful . i found usb clipper power cord without craddle fantastic . my sony dv cam requires craddle everything , driving me nuts . i like just plug it get it , hassle free , great ! more " advanced features " camera , modes customization etc . i advise - try it your own risk . didn't work too well me . i stick fully auto mode this one . if you serious using thse fancy features , you really should try dslr . this type cutie cameras not cut out it . oh , video quality fine , but nothing special there either . my only complaint it doesn't come cute little case matches camera . way , i didn't high expectations this kodak camera ( or any kodak camera ) when i bought it . it purely its cuteness ( gift wife ) . picture quality really exceeded my expectation big margin . highly recommended	1
great camera when i don't want lug slr . fits nice shirt pocket but it feels little heavy . very fast startup , so you ready shot hurry . i bought extra battery universal charger because i lot indoor , flash shots . gets 100 those pics charge . i suspect you get many more without flash . sure bring charger your trips	-1
very good compact camera . excellent take around fits perfectly pocekts	-1
well , i finally bought sony r1 , after wait price drop , read all reviews it .. i got it 565$ . what i like r1 : build quality , good zeiss lens , 24mm wide angle , iso change cam just botton .. great colors balance , low noise high iso , big cmos sensor , use both pro stick cf card , long battery life , displays batt life mins , useable high iso 400 , top view swivel lcd , manual tele zoomring , good raw files . what i dont like : battery charges camera big draw back , while you charge batt , you cant use camera shoot , bad feature , hope sony improves it next camera . camera design so weird , grip over size , off balance hand , view finder housing over size , use external flash you go menu change it everytime , change back use pop up flash , cant use both flashes , missing ois(opical image stabilizer ) , its heavy big , tele 120mm 4.8 , af not fast , its kinda slow , especially dark , sony should learn this cam improves it next camera , im sure they . price abit too high point shoot , no video mode , macro too far subject , 15 niches . other than i love use it , its my main camera walk around , i love image result quality , thats why i bought it , i know no camera perfect yet . price i paid im not complainning . its dslr wanna , very close dslr results . i strongly suggest any one who wants back up dslr .	-1
great travel camera . i leave my canon d20 kit home . fact , i find myself using this thing all time--it very easy use , love ergonomics . only caveats -- high iso ratings way too noisy , not nearly good canon . also , excellent lens too short telephoto end . otherwise , one best lenses out there . battery performance excellent . bulky , but light . buy high quality protective filter , like b+w or hoya . use it enjoy	1
yes thats right , just what i mean . this battery fully charged your nikon camera you actually take time both take picture smell flowers , without worry changing battery(this many times same charge ) . received this battery , charged it up started taking pictures right away . taken 75 pictures , 65 them flash . time writing this review battery still camera its same charge . ( ps . always use save battery function , if your camera this feature )	1
if this battery one your camera , buy least two these get recharger ac one dc . i taken hundreds 5.1 mp shots just two batteries . recharging one while using other . if i missed shot it wasn't dead battery fault . if you buy two these batteries you take pics like you just don't care , you won't either . what more could you ask ? it no brainer	1
these great binoculars . i've owned much more expensive binoculars truely don't see any difference . great buy . they 100% waterproof since i flipped my canoe they not affected any way	1
well , let start free shipping , this item arrived my house 3 days after i placed my order , fast .. secondly , case itself just greatly designed protect your items 2 eyepieces , led flashlight , moon filters barlow 2x , umm , also keys locks case which i wouln't use , so i threw them away already , altogether 9 piece ... i mean its 8 now without keys :) i am currently using them my celestron firstscope 114eq 114mm reflector telescope but there something missing this accessory kit 4mm eyepiece , thats right , this telescope max 227.5 magnification how come this kit doesn't 4mm ( 225x ) eyepiece ? instead whining i decided get omni series 4mm eyepiece celestron looks like i am all set now . thirdly , i wanna talk celestron tech . service , its great see double magnification barlow , but unfortunately its screw drove me nuts ' cuz middle night i ve lost it ( easy lose it btw ) then they sent me new one without interrogation .. overall i am satisfied this item i would recommend this accessory kit you ..	-1
this first decent digital cameras i ever owned . i am not sure what deal people complaining battery life . buy recharger . i used same batteries two years i owned this camera . i run into glitches time time most likely due me putting batteries there when they not fully charged(yes i am inpatient ) sometimes camera looks like it took picture then it crashes . other times it not turn off . opening re-closing battery door always fixes it . i am sure both these issues due me putting weak batteries . durability ? i am not sure what deal people complaining no lens cover . who cares ? i dropped this camera so many times i cannot even begin count ! this thing built really well !! i never worry putting camera down lens up . i just toss it my desk when i am it . still takes great pictures . i bitched this camera time time but i taken nearly 1100 pictures it it still going strong . now memory cards so cheap , i finally bought one camera . 1 gig one let you take 4000 (!!!) low definition pictures . course low def like 1024x768 this camera . my only beef why not vga resolution anymore ? i always shrink pics down use this ebay .	-1
this case hold my elura 100 accessories perfectly . not too big , not too small . plus it well padded . movable divider lets you snug camera one side while making room accessories other . tip : upper flap hold two mini-dv tapes it zippered pouch , which adds extra layer protection up top	1
i just got this camera christmas . i hate reading directions , so i popped battery memory card i off ! very user friendly , all right options . plus , its size average cell phone . coolest thing powershot it knows which way you're holding camera , so if you hold it vertical get tall shot , viewer turns all itself . i also love you edit video camera set up slide shows . its very easy load pics onto my computer usb connection - or set up slide show tv . it even holds voice memos cute sound effects when i take pictures . this really great camera	1

i looking basic pair binoculars our everyday use . i some really expensive leupold binoclulars my favorite , but all around family use , especially kids , this great option . they waterproof , rubber coated protection , powerful ( 10x ) , focus easily adjustable . money ? it great buy	-1
bought these binoculars my husband . he loves them . they very powerful he loves way they feel - not too heavy . he look stuff across creek amazed clarity things he sees	1
i like not change lens very often . pictures taken this lens high quality i expected	1
i purchased this lens reduce amount lens changes field while traveling . 18mm 200mm range gave me one lens i could travel shoot great results . i am totally satisfied my purchase choice , my first results recent vacation trip rewarding	1
there so many choices out there , especially if you're relatively new digital cameras . i purchased this camera year ago because i heard old timers schneider-kreuznach lens good leica lens . also this featured 6 . mp 10x zoom . i publish magazine time time i take photos sales staff members auto dealership various other photos buildings , people street scenes . one day , rooster car dealership 20 yards away . i didn't want scare him away so shot him 20 yards despite distance there no blur quality good if only 5 feet away . i owned nikons , pentaxs minoltas , these lens good if not better . it comes kodak software makes it easy . good solid feel . color quality outstanding if you use enclosed software or photoshop you enhance any photo appears tad dark or light optimal results . i've using this camera now almost year all time it reliable performer work or play . i never used it real dark situations , but flash work automatically if more light needed . highly recommended	1
these glasses small , protable good concerts quick bird work . i keep set car , but they not replace my larger busnells birding . please don't expect more than little backyard birding these , i am now adjusted my larger set , so i use those yard . you get what you pay	-1
what not like ? light , compact comes strap , case wipe cloth . they perfect . keep mind 12 power more challeging hold still	1
if you bought camera , you need this kit . it gives you extras you need . you still buy card photos	1
starter kit better value than buying all these items separately . bag able put all essentials like spare tapes , cables , batteries . if bag just little bit bigger more storage would perfect . overall good value especially since extended battery lasts 4 hours regular use compared just over 1 hour standard battery	-1
all all , great value , but bag could just little bigger all accessories	1
bought these binoculars my husband . he loves them . they very powerful he loves way they feel - not too heavy . he look stuff across creek amazed clarity things he sees	1
i bought it gift digital camera/video i'd gotten few years ago , so i could send it couple who new baby boy . they pleased it thanked me such great gift not only camera but also charger battery would last 8 hrs shoot their christmas 2006	1
it just what charger should : light weight , simple use , dependable . i would recommend it over any other charger	-1
i bought this battery charger addition extra battery my canon g3 digital camera . reason canon really short-sighted not shipping camera least external charger . price i paid , they could least that!it really good camera 1 or 2 quirks you get used . excellent quality photos . but you can't use camera while it charging battery . after 2 years i finally gave bought this charger . someone must suffering guilty conscience canon , cause it came 5 different power cables , so i plug into almost any power outlet world . just careful note difference cables usa japan , because they almost identical	-1
fast lense decent price . can't go wrong this one	1
i purchased this lens supplement my kit 18-55 which i found wasn't fast enough capture indoor shots my two little girls without flash . i say everyone should buy this lens . one first additional lenses i purchased my nikon d40 , i absolutely stunned blown away tack sharp images speed this tiny little gem . while it manual focus only d40 , everything else works just fine . it even tells you when image focus via green focus light found inside viewfinder . keep mind 1.8 its easy your main subject slip out focus . portrait shots , 2.8 usually plenty get fast shutter speed plenty bokeh . those split this 1.4 , if price difference wasn't so big , i'd say go it . but 1.8 you're getting extremely fast capable lens price just cannot beat . i'm filling up my hard drive every day pics i simply could not captured my kit lens . there some shortcomings like manual zoom , manual focus d40 it small plastic casing probably won't survive fall ( my 70-300 vr massive next it ) but it more than makes up its shortcomings amazing shots it takes . i promise you , you'll hard pressed find any other quality glass this price range	1
i tried many different camcorders/digital cameras before landing onto this one samsung . both camera camcorder let me make excellent quality pictures movies my own . sounds also real great without any noticeable mechanical noise . i also impressed way it adjusts brightness flash light automatically depending places . controls buttons easy operate but took me couple days get used it . when compared ones jvc or sony , scd6550 clear winner unbeatable price quality . i am not professional photographer so i cannot evaluate machine too technical terms . but , large , this dual functional camcorder fully serves my needs most portable way . i strongly recommend this product personal family use	1
i hp took okay pictures but close-ups blurry . i tried kodak easy share . pictures " okay " but it took very long time transfer them . close ups little blurry . deceiding kodak not wise choice . it then i recalled best photos i ever taken nikon pictures looked good some even better thanpostcards . seriously ! i ventured out one more time buy digital camera i would try one more . thankfully , nikon stopped my camera blues . this camera alot great features . it works great small items like jewelry . i am very happy withthe quality . although it little bigger than other twodigitals i bought , i not mind . if you not concerned quality want camera fit your pocket then buy hp or kodak . you want sharp vibrant pictures ? if , yes . here your answer .	1
i chance work this camera 2 months . it lot options i tried most them . panorama shots cool . camera takes nice pictures . it relatively heavier bulkier . battery not lasting long always issue digital . i recommend powerex battery charger . best longest lasting batteries . huge number megapixels lets you zoom really close computer . i took series picture my cat it going bite hand it funny look facial expressions change close zoom . i like canon slightly better , because it more handy . but salesman said this choice like two very similar cars , just made different company . perhaps .	1
great size shape taking places . feels good your hand . boots up pretty quick . like color . impressed features . takes decent pictures . internal memory , well taking memory card . i suggest getting set good rechargable batteries .	1
i bought olympus c-750 ultra zoom camera 3 years ago this charger batteries included package . i able take up 400-500 pictures per charge . ( includes taking alot pictures flash ) . batteries take 9 hours charge completely but it well worth it .... just charge them over night you sleep . i never worry carrying spare batteries or running out battery life . i took camera 2 week vacation through midwest able take all my vacation pics plus more personal pics when i arrived back home still plenty battery life left !!!!.... buy these .... you wont regret it !!!	1
i little dubious when ordering this , quality clarity lens view they would give , i should not worried , they top class . units quite light too ! now add camera functions it it top shelf . i use it deer hunting new zealand , during ' stalk ' you see some interesting things , animals fighting , bonking , doing different things which i always thought if only i camera ! often i come out bush say i saw 4 today 18 21 pointer spiker hind , some give you look disbelief , now its ' hey look these ones i saw today ' oh cop size this boar i saw across river . only reason i didn't give this 5 out 5 i feel conttrols could , easier , once you used them , they good but its fine tooth thru instructions , get it right . good unit recommend it all	-1
i firm believer digimax line since they first introduced . i owned both digimax 201 digimax s600 i loved both those cameras , however , s800 more than exceeded my expectations . i use this camera photographing handmade items i sell ebay it captures details exquisitely . i also use s800 photograph family events come up it worked well many situations , even those held inside or particularly dark settings . i'd recommend s800 anyone who looking easy use , effective camera . i haven't found any problems this camera	1
i agree . pauley review . i've owned this camera six months taken it several long trips already . pictures i've taken stunning regardless lighting , i couldn't happier . i'd buy this samsung again without reservation . 8mp this price -- great quality photos--can't beat	1
got p712 upgrade gift over holidays . i think learning curve past me this point now handle how take decent photo this super-zoom . here what you might like : * excellent zoom lens world class optics . * shooting photo auto mode makes picture taking easy . * 7.1 mp provides good detail . * very good battery life . 200+ shots using rechargeable included . * manual mode , shutter priority mode aperture mode great serious amateur . * uses sd cards which inexpensive easily found . * all it metering through lens so filters add optics work well . * true optical image stabilization . few reviews mentioned kodak add lenses . i both telephoto wide angle must say they really extend optical range p712 . telephoto turns camera into 635mm lens , wide angle down 20mm . flash kodak markets this unit also pro level enough " oompf " light auditorium . i'm pleased impressed this camera . i'm getting great shots it . i think you too . any downshots ? few : * video marred sound auto-focus . forget using zoom while making video , it sounds like truck driving . * tends overexpose little bright sunlight auto mode . * not pocketable-this substantial camera .	1
awesome camera . still trying learn how use all features but even little we know it takes awesome pictures	1
i bought this camera because large lcd . general , i am pretty happy f650 , price right . it takes great pictures very little lag shots which big improvement my last camera . i purchased xd card circuit city , they only sold olympus cards i figured brand didn't matter . i found 50% shots saved xd card corrupted garbled . so , while vacation i bought xd card , this time fuji brand , it working fine ever since . i don't know if i just got bad card or if you must use fuji card fuji camera . only other thing i don't care it not ergonomic i always feel like i ( or someone else holding it ) drop it . i use wrist strap every time i pick it up .	-1
i wanted replace my fuji e550 this logical choice . i wanted able use my xd picture cards . after reading all reviews i opted get it i'm not disappointed . i love 3 " screen back menu very easy me follow since it similar my old one . i am anxious try all new setttings my old one never like fireworks , sunset , beach . i think you'll very happy this camera	1
item works perfectly . i guess one should expect this since it oem replacement part	1
only negative these binoculars they come really cheesy plastic strap , which i promptly threw away . otherwise they function fine bargain binocular	-1
this bit pricy what it , but useful handheld shots if your triprod doesn't balance indicator good thing use . nice compact seems decent quality .	-1
plastic o ring carrying case which holds large shoulder strap came broken . thus it renders case un-useable . time , my cost it would file complaint ship case back not worth it me . however if bushnell would send me new carrying case , i would very pleased transaction . howard . rutkowski	-1
case fitted well camera . there pocket extra memory card storeage card . only wish it carry handle .	-1
i bought this mobicam based recommendation friend . we really love able see hear baby vs . just listening monitor . infrared feature awesome - you see total darkness . i chose 900mhz so it wouldn't interfere 2.4 ghz wireless network nor cordless phones house . this one no interference any these devices . it tend pick up little static time time , but not really noticable . i guess i need read directions well .. because i yet figure out how turn monitor off during night ( it really bright ) , so right now we just kind point it towards wall . overall , we love it would purchase agai	-1
this just mp3 card reader , nothing else . if you getting sd card then it great , but don't think your kid going change his ipod ! i paid around $30 so it great . sound also good	-1
canon powershot s70 my opinion best point shoot camera you buy money . it all shooting modes slr camera would but slim compact design . set dial preset settings different situations or tweak more professional dial choices get perfect shot . though if you not up up digital cameras these settings may seem bit overwhelming . 7.1 mp your pictures come out extremely clear . most point shoot cameras only 3x optical zoom , but this baby 3.6 optical zoom . though sometimes this doesn't get close one would want . add-on easy find any store carries camera . i haven't any need extra battery but i would recommend getting 512mb compact flash ii even betting images . if you thinking you need camera substantial zoom then i would not suggest buying telephoto lens bought accessory . if you want close up images you take lens off then put it back zoom feature . over all , this camera great everyday use those who want all features professional slr digital cameras . i would highly recommend it anyone market new digital camera .	1
found this camera easy use , large 2.5 lcd monitor , good sharp pictures , suggest using ni-mh rechargeable batteries rather than alkaline ones more shots taken . voice mode 30 second movies . many shoot modes	1
you can't beat features this camera its price . very light weight , ergonomic , easy use . takes awesome macro shots , close you want . it little hard stay steady telefocus lens all way out . sometimes auto uses high iso my taste making picture little grainy during night shots . fully manual well . if you learn use manual controls you take just any shot you want clarity . i love my camera	1
we wide angle lens needed kodak lens adapter our camera . adapter lens work well . fantastic pictures vacation	1
i'm not entirely new photography . i two canon pocket cameras ( 35mm ) sony digital pocket camera , so i some expectations what could . i say fz50 blown me away . automatic mode , it great point shoot . i doubt i'll ever use it video clips , but i've able include pictures my power point presentations very helpful . i slowly acquainting myself various modes capabilities , such macros closeups . this process take several months least . well worth price . quality outstanding everything works it should . i'm not sure extra memory ( 10.1 mp ) actually necessary , if you could get fz30 less , would actually better deal most folks .	1
this camera takes great pictures travel outdoors . if you intend take family photo indoors you need large room group shots it 35-420 zoom . said i am very happy this camera it long list functions . software better than some i've seen . camera easy use right out box . make sure you buy memory card . battery ahs very long life but i bought spare so i wouldn't caught without my camera . my only complaint photo load slowly my computer compared other cameras	1
this not ink jet printer . it dye sublimation printer which means it produces same quality prints local one hour -- only it your house ! i not problems loading cartridge or paper . i printed my kodak camera , computer flash drive . unit small portable , my mind , easily replace idea using poloroid classroom display student picture " good behavior work " . i like fact paper ink coordinated because then i know when it run out . these prints far superior ink jet if you want commercial quality prints home -- this it	1
i bought this camera after tired my current fuji finepix a340 . a340 great camera , but time btw pix painfully slow me . plus , i needed excuse buy new camera ! z1 actually bought mistake . i after different camera , hastily bought this one i am extremely glad i . first i wary rechargeable battery going take it back , but i opted toy it few days firs t.t he rechargeable battery really no issue . you get 200px per charge there always option buying backup off ebay $40 . ( don't fall extended warranty crap some appliance stores . they told me it $60 if battery goes i get new one , well since i get 1.5 batteries warranty cost , i opted take my chances save my money)i love metal case practically instant when sliding cover . size smaller than deck cards but it doesn't feel fragile . there no view finder , which fine me , i never use it since i went digital anyway . there lot settings i found dark environments , this camera slick !!! easily best dark environment camera i've ever owned . i'm not photo expert , i take lot pictures , long they clear , crisp enough print if i choose , i'm happy . i am sure there other cameras others say better this or but casual photo taking endeavor , this fuji perfect	1

this particular barlow , orion shorty , highly recommended several astronomy forums internet . i got this one instead orion simply because amazon offering it $52 time . i've found i enjoy using barlow when viewing planets few dso . it provides economical way virtually increase number eyepieces your collection . it introduce little light loss my eyepieces ( maybe this normal all eyepieces ) , but it not troublesome . i certainly recommend this barlow those you who want cheaply expand your eyepiece collection	1
lenmar battery third party alternative original panasonic battery . this kind batteries mostly use lower quality materials , which result long charge times short use . however , this particular battery indistinguishable original panasonic battery battery life charging times . it turned out great second battery my fx-01 . it could come case , but since i case original battery i keep one batteries inside camera , there no need one	1
if you trying pick choose pix off your camera card , any digital frame disappointing you . these not $100 computers . this one jpg slide show , mp3 player bare bones mpg avi video player ! its primary use , you'll probably want enhance your images shrink file size display small lcd wide screen anyway . what i edit images real computer copy them empty flash device . i plug this into frame copy pix onboard memory . also great playing videos youtube etc . off plugin flash . only caveats : 1 . no support company web site .

glossy paper when making prints creates great dark blacks very white whites , if you're taking photography class plan using many sheets , i would highly recommend buying larger package rather than bunch small ones . you'll save money way too	1

this excellent camcorder , it small , easy carry around , good battery life . it even fits into inexpensive carying case we our digital camera . it lot great features served us well our vacation . its said before , but only real drawback this instructions . claridy : camcorder transfer still pics its sd slot via usb cable , you need firewire transfer it computer or use webcam - both which work very well . it also all necessary cables you need if you just want hook it up your vhs/home dvd burner via a/v cables record , or just watch playback tv . it could use external audio mic output , but we found internal microphone quite sensitive met our needs very well . overall : definately recomende	1

i bought this camera my honeymoon , i expected lot snorkling thought price compared favorably purchasing several waterproof disposable cameras . camera case functioned properly easy use . pictures taken land turned out swell . undersea pictures okay , but could better . flash automatic , my opinion , camera would taken much better photographs if it could activated manually . all all , great inexpensive vacation camera , but don't expect take pictures like jacques cousteau	-1
okay , first foremost , this seems camera everyone forgot , including panasonic . go their website venture comparison page , it like no one bothered fill out spec sheet . if you go online search reviews this camera there no shortage criticism pro set , faulting it not this feature or , but once you research cameras those features cost grand two grand more ! ironically , this undeserved disdain neglect seems resulted real deal , both affordable versatile . it less features than some professional cameras more than most consumer cameras . it works great imovie great way me familiarize myself shooting general . it not hd , but neither 99.9% places it played . maybe i learn more i'll become more aware its limitations my opinion change , yes , lens smaller than i'd like , but 3ccd makes huge difference colors contrast . one thing bear mind , this great piece equipment someone who works professional directors videographers , but no way replacement such skilled outstanding professionals . basically , if you're director or videographer you'll want far more serious piece equipment , but if you're writer or art director who just wants firmer grasp shooting process this camera you ! all all , it great learn great price . not bad combination all .	-1
this my first digital camera , i lot search finaly i decide dsc-w55 black , what i looking , small enough it my purse , lot functions , very easy import pictures my computer , you only connect camera usb cable you don't need install software came camera , i windows vista i didn't any problems transfering pictures , best camera price great , you choose super saver shipping save more . you love this camera too , small , very pretty , lots options , take great pictures . some one wrote review this camera feels like plastic , that not true , looks very durable me i think good product worth every single dollar you spend . easy shoot pictures auto adjustment mode , start taking pictures sooner you charge battery , because this camera internal memory you buy memory card later . well hope you lots fun taking pictures , good luck ..!	1
i really love my first digital camera ! i searched i searched i finally found what i wanted . pictures crystal clear , movie playback exceptional - you only hear what you're supposed , no loud background noise or static , no muffled noise . pictures come out so clear after you take picture you zoom 5x count pores your face ! i love it ! i don't think i could ask better camera . i hope this camera last me atleast 4 years or more or until i graduate college . if one market afford it , get this camera ! there cheaper cameras but if you want get camera , get good one , doesn't mean it expensive , but my opinion you get what you pay . thanks reading . happy buying	1
i own e-300 bag full manual focusing olympus pentax lenses , which i use addition some auto-focus 4/3rds ones . glasses wearer i constantly adjusting my diopter straining get things into focus when using manuals , result perhaps 25% my shots unusable . this little magnifier makes big difference . several recent outings i absolutely great results . most shots sharp clear . there bit downside i work little harder see readout viewfinder , but i really don't need . don't expect eye-popping change , but change you notice . good product	1
i purchased many simulated security cameras . swann simulated security camera excellent quality construction housing design would fool even most skeptical viewers . long term battery life ( i cameras blinking light last long 8 months without change batteries ! ) . highly recommend	1
i no complaints . i this camera over year half it reliable , fast , gives me crisp , quality photos ! only option i wish this camera better stabilization mode prevent blurred pictures , but software edits blur without reducing quality . blurry pictures not problem long you know how aim shoot . everyone loves playing my camera because it many cool features make your photos fun ! i highly recommend this camera ( especially beginners or those who just want simple camera capture those precious moments , high quality photos ) . excellent camera overall ! ;	1
extremely easy use . price amazon terrific vs . circuit city offering . like way you view immediately dvd player . picture quality sunny conditions not good grainy digitial picture taking	-1
this camcorder very easy use , light , takes good video well decent stills . my only complaint would disk length - dvd still only holds 30 minutes video . i found some hold 60 , but only web , not stores	-1
video great . even lp setting quality good . able put 5,100 stills one dvd great . i always carry one dvd video stills . small , compact easy use . what more could you want	1
this really special purpose head . its best used monopod not tripod since you get enough tilt range tilting mononpod . only reasons you even use this monopod quick release or vertical shots . its just not flexible enough tripod . tripod use i'd suggest either bogen 486 or 488 ball heads , both which offer good value come quick release . any case , note this uses rc2 quick release . if you use camera supports even 20% time , you just keep quick release attached your slr . i've got two other heads all use rc2 system . adapter always my camera i easily attach it any my tripods/monopods . its really easy use encourages me set up tripod/monopod when i might otherwise get too lazy	1
this quick release tilt head works wonderful my monopod . i leave top part head connected my camera ( nikon d70s ) all time when i want use my monopod it just clicks place my monopod very securely off i go taking more pictures	1
it very nice case . beautiful small . i like it so much . it good protect my camera . i drop my camera case ground 2 times . it still work well . very nice	1
it works really well , but it not panoramic like i hoping it would . if you're looking enhancement you should get this , but if you're expecting too much you may better off buying newer digital camera	-1
i am trying my hands taking close-up pictures first time . i bought this lense without really knowing how it works because i thought it take better close-up pictures . indeed , it . not only i take nice clear picture but i take close up 6 " clarity . i tell ya , if you wanna try wide angle you new this want something cheap . get this , it worth your while . oh !! one problem i encounter seller : deliversy service not prompt i expected customer reviews . disappointed sense but truly happy product	-1
i've owned this camera over year now , i continually find myself reaching this one whenever i need know i get shot i want . i love quality color kodak prints , well ease use those us who closer " point shoot " type consumers . if i make numerous adjustments camera before shooting , i would never get pictures i want ... i'm usually taking pictures kids or animals , or scenery , or concerts i love able snap several photos while others still busy composing one shot . it consistent i rely end product very good , it overall better redeye than my 4 mp olympus . ( yes i lot cameras ! ) many years i used 35 mm canon ae1 everything still love quality you get those , but digital addictive . able delete retake pictures just invaluable . i disagree other reviewer video clips . i inadvertently shot some video concert ( it dark i turned wheel wrong setting ) it simply showed up photo software downloaded easily pictures . i click it it plays . i find software simple it could more features , but it adequate , especially considering price this camera , i don't rely solely kodak software editing , etc . i find battery life amazing .... i buy 1800 lithium batteries always carry extra , but rarely change one vacation . i just returned ireland , shooting 350 pix only changed it end trip .... awesome . i think one my favorite things this camera shutter lag ( or lack shutter lag ) , this baby ready go next shot time i am ... it one reasons i capture so many shots quickly , then sit back enjoy scenery not waiting camera ready again . my olympus terrible this regard . i say i can't recommend kodak z7590 same way ( i've owned it over year also ) , but review time . my first digital camera 2 mp kodak dx3440 still takes awesome pictures after dropped several times . this little camera portable goes into purse easily lightweight , perfect vacations or going concerts . i think it little gem . there lots more technically qualified reviewers here give you specifications details , but person who just likes grab camera use auto settings .... print up 8 10 my canon photo printer , it perfect . most my pictures turn out great , photo lab quality . ( i i860 canon printer)i one incident this camera ireland when it misting rain shutter failed open all way ... i got 3 beautiful but strange pictures edges shutter framing gorgeous green landscape , but it only momentary camera soon returned performing perfectly , i simply dried shutter , got out rain .... :) i hope this review helps someone . if you pro , or advanced photographer , you already something lot more sophisticated , but average person who just likes take good pictures , you can't beat this camera ! good luck !	1
this cover goes good case kit made d40 . i wish case little larger . i also wish they made more custom cover you could leave camera use	-1
i travelling europe via japan , singapore , australia new zealand usa . anyhow they handling my luggage so badly they broke one those flights my charger ( possibly somewhere security ) . i tried several shops houston buy replacement including sonystyle shop . no luck all . went back hotel , look amazon.com, ordered it it two days later delivered my room . that perfect service .	1
product compact portable , seems solid well made . zoom good , functions all fairly simple . hooks up tv easily enough . nigh vision feature , while providing better visibility , creates more strobing effect than i would liked . also , i not yet figured out how transfer video computer ( i right cable ) , but i haven't tried too hard figure it out	-1
i like this camcorder because it small , lightweight travels easily . neat little feature- you take snapshots while recording video . i'm very happy optical zoom . only downfall- no separate charger battery so camera plugged charge it , which very limiting . upside- it charges quickly .	-1
there isn't much more say here . this superb little camera , definately worth 10 cnet , not 7.0 their review gave it ! they completely got it wrong their rating because this camera definitely deserves least 8.0 ! here , it also gets my 5 stars ! far pros go this camera ( 28mm wide angle , 10x optical zoom , 3 '' lcd , , built-in lens cover ) , it exactly good it sounds ! real life needs real life situations real people loves superb photos right camera capture those moments . cons side ( no manual controls , no zoom video mode , average battery life ) , those practically only things more advanced user would care . manual controls mostly expert photographers white balance exposure settings already this camera , so i don't know what else you need . zooming video mode isn't important me since i don't particularly take much video footage . i only say average battery life because i tend look through photos i already shot pretty often without using power save lcd , therefore , that particularly what drains battery . however , you usually get @ 250-270 shots per charge , without frequent previewing . panasonic basically taken original tz1 made it even better . there not much missing this camera . i've said , 28mm wide angle leica lens , 10x optical zoom , 3 " high resolution screen , excellent image stabilization , etc . all this fairly compact camera . panasonic also improved " noise " higher iso . low light performance much better than previous panasonic models . most important this , camera takes fantastic pictures . thing i'm extremely impressed construction finish alone . just holding it your hands it screams quality feels like tank . i love it . it seriously feels like $700 camera . no exaggeration . i little worried it not able fit my jean pockets before buying it . women may issues really tight jeans but us guys no problem . it fits fine . i seriously can't believe i carry around camera 10x zoom inside my jean pockets . truly remarkable . 3 " screen amazing . you practically enjoy your pics right screen without even printing them high resolution output . image quality great , if you need extra sharpness want " canon-like look , " you could always use camera " vivid mode . " it also not much bigger or heavier than your overpriced sony . plus , here , i found it three hundred , high speed 1gb panasonic card included . what better than ?! only accessory i buy now just dmw-ct3-k , leather case specifically this camera . you really can't find perfect digital camera , but this comes close you get . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you looking great zoom camera small enough form factor , you should seriously consider dmc-tz3 . this best compact camera i've ever owned	1
i came off canon powershot s40 , little 4-megapixel brick camera gave me 4 years excellent results . my first digital camera after closet-full film nikons . many buffs claim 4 megapixels all you need , i made number nice looking a3 prints . now i 7 megapixels work , i see i wrong : four not enough . seven wonderful . [ ... ] points out strongly above iso 200 noise real problem -- but you always wonder just how picky they . well not too picky this case . using higher than 200 setting ( i.e. , most indoor flash shots ) resulted lot noise , making camera almost unusable except simplest 4 6 snapshots . but i take almost entirely outdoor shots -- scenics candids . i set iso 100 get gorgeous results . it taken some getting used different color rendition tz3 my canon . canon seems more balanced while tz3 caused reddish orange really pop out . there something cool ( color temperature-wise , not " fashionable " ) color not entirely fixed photoshop . sometimes results marvelous , especially shots cloudy or rainy days . other times they not so grea t--t o desaturated my taste . so i playing around various settings --" natural " " vivid . " " vivid " closer what i want right out camera , but less easy spruce up . " natural " easier modify , so setting i am using now . i also set exposure compensation one stop under . i pleasantly surprised how small tz3 : it slips easily into pants pocket ( but not shirt pocket ) . zoom lens starting decent wide-angle ( 28mm ) utterly fantastic really makes camera stand out head shoulders pack . thus , i am delighted choice . however , answer my question " what more could i want ? " , here it : 1 . selection disk always moves when i pocket camera , so i always check , when i pull it out , reset it desired setting . its detents need strengthened . 2 . back-side controls too easy activate accidentally when shooting one-handed fleshy part thumb . headache because you then need press " select " get back operation . 3 . dpreview right when they moan venus iii sensor . it good but , otherwise sensational camera like this one , not good enough	-1
if you looking nice sized digital picture frame , not hesitate get this one . it incredible value . it very durable feeling picture bright , crisp , just superb . i got this my mom , but am going buy one myself now . it two annoyances i would change few new ideas would make this perfect product . annoyances : - power switch back so it makes wall hanging bit problem . this easily overcome plugging it into power strip or something else switch . - no random option slideshow ( i could find ) this should able addressed firmware upgrade . ideas : - option run it off batteries so you could pass it around room like stack conventional pictures- mouse wheel type control side easy scrolling up/down pictures . - timer so you could tell it turn itself off 11pm 7am or whatever . oh , make sure you get latest firmware . you just copy it one cards this frame supports , power cycle , say yes upgrade , you're . [ ...	-1
this picture frame works goods only one flaw . it power switch back . you use power switch turn it . it not turn remote . if you planning hanging this wall you need take it down every time you want turn it or off . other than it works nice .	-1
solved all my rechargeable batteries problems my olympus sp-350 camera ... best choice i've ever made regarding this issue	1
while i like this lens , when zoomed all way out i see edge lens through camera big blacked out circle around outside edge video . i'm sure larger lens would help , but i think it good compromise due its weight which isn't bad some say , it balances camera larger battery pack quite well	-1
i got lucky this camera !! my hubby bought new digital slr cannon rebel xt paying $899 last year then he buy telephoto lens needless say we over 1200 dollars involved , i wanted macro lens my insect shots which we never got . i found this camera local goodwill store display case $15.00 took chance it worked . i love this camera !! it everything my hubby without change any lens . i learned operate it no time all . only drawback battery doesn't last long ... i guess that why there 2 extra box . i love it insect shots if nothing else ! i carry my jeans pocket pentax 7meg . i just bought it also great camera , but paid $200 it qvc	-1
this camera great ! not only it take great digital photos extremely user friendly , but if you add 1gb memory card it ( which slides right only costs $40.00 ) you take lot great quality digital videos sound very easy upload your computer and/or internet email family etc . fact , there no need buy video camera when you this it fits right your pocket . i take up 30 minute videos lots photos one time . you easily take photo while you making video well	1

this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet .	-1
this item best resolution market today , wood grain frame looks great . functionality good simple once you get used it . capabilities usb memory card very versatile . out box , i up running under 15 minutes . my only complaint frame doesn't autorotate , but it great it it own hard drive you save photos too . if you drop $200 , it great digital photo frame .	-1
this surprisingly very good camera . though it 4mp camera , picture quality so much better than other 5 or 6mp cameras . we chance comparison when we ( group friends ) took lot pictures park using different types cameras . pics dsc-s60 so much brighter clearer . i guess only problem dsc-s60 it quite bulky ( compared similar models ) . it could quite pain carrying this around whole day .	-1
i purchased this camcorder lot hesitancy because reviews it received here amazon , but price i got it , it hard refuse . first , camera very lightweight sturdy construction . if handled delicately , i don't foresee any spontaneous operational issues appearing . if you drop it kick it around , then sure , it going break not function correctly . i am very pleased quality film it produced . i am amateur photographer videographer , i no complaints personally this particular model . it functions well all light , i especially impressed how it low-light . i found reading manual thoroughly understanding cameras functions helped me immensely avoid problems . overall , i am pleased it am glad i chose it . i full faith this camera , why it going used alaskan cruise , film my wedding this summer . it great camera price . now , i couple rants it . - when specialized mode while filming , display very slow . so i haven't able " real time filming " when i am shooting something , i see it on-screen , it already happened something else going . - camera not come any extras , which meant we run store get mini dv tapes required start using it immediately . - biggest issue actually caused me lot frustration anger this camera you cannot transfer your film your computer through usb . my other cameras , i always able transfer all digital images ( movies stills ) over usb . not this . you special cable ( firewire 4 pin 4 pin ) you port it your computer . most average computer users not this port ( i new dell dimension ) so , i go buy firewire port ( $14.99 ) , open my computer case physically install hardware . firewire cable itself really inexpensive . someone who doesn't know computers needs this port , it could honestly cost you quite bit it installed you . it turns into lot hassel , which isn't very appealing todays technological consumer . overall , i rate it good camera money , but i not like issue firewire cable .	-1

this very well thought out product - you get all pro features you need very small affordable package . it full ttl flash nikon cameras - meaning camera meter scene adjust flash timing power match what you shooting , all automatically . such , it very hard take one those terrible , washed out flash pictures . flash unit itself mounted so it easily tilted flash bouncing give warmer lighting effect off ceiling - way it put together means it still very compact . very clever . fact , unit so small it easy carry you just case you need it . finally , you get nikon quality - build very good , it supplied nice padded case . all this little more than price generic flash unit camera store !	1
fairly new dslr world , i'm constantly learning how get best out my d50 . this flash most important piece puzzle get results i want . i very frustrated when i always got washed out look when shooting indoor photos my newborn son . once i learned flash bounce purchased sb-4oo , i really started get results i looking . skin tones much more natural it really illuminates background provides great fill light . excellent purchase , must if shooting indoor shots	1
if you need small flash lot more powerful than on-camera flash your compatible nikon camera , this great flash . more than anything , it better than on-camera flash also bounce capability , which none on-camera flashes . me , it doesn't replace full-featured flash like sb-800 or sb-600 , but lot smaller lighter many times when you don't need big mama . it not powerful enough instance bounce if ceiling higher than 10 or 11 feet lower iso settings , where sb-800 still reach . i found i don't use it often i thought i would , but that really because i've not gotten into habit using fill-flash much i should . that not fault flash . it fully automatic , which really means there nothing set or control this unit . if your camera isn't compatible , basically this flash won't work you . if it compatible , it works great seamlessly . i use it d200 , d70 cp8400 , it works great all them . one thing keep mind if you thinking using it " better " main flash instance d200 wireless remote flash mode , think again . only actual in-camera flash used remote commander mode d200 . , this unit not capable remote flash wireless flash , either . so basically , don't consider it part wireless remote flash operation . it better than in-camera flash , not wireless flash . also keep mind far i know coolpix line only 8400 8800 fully compatible this . most newer dslrs , though . if your camera isn't i-ttl , it not flash you . check compatibility before you buy . if you want small fully integrated flash your nikon digital , it great unit .	1

i received my dsc-t100 sony cybershot 2 weeks ago . it wonderful camera . i'm not professional photographer any means . i found myself tired lugging around larger camera everytime we went vacation ( found i didn't really use one much when we weren't vacation ) . not using my camera very often , course , i forgot most it features . my pictures generally reflected . i really wanted camera i could me all time use more often . this sony cybershot fit bill exactly !!! i ordered small camera holder than i thread onto my belt . i carry my camera me every day now . i've gotten so many pictures since i've carrying it . it so easy just open start taking pics . it ready instantly takes terrific pictures . top , i'm actually able use features camera since i'm using it more often . i'm also taking video it finding it very simple takes great video . i suppose time tell how well built it carrying it around me every day . it feels very solid . smaller camera , i'm learn where place ( or more appropriately not place my hands ) when taking pics . i've gotten my finger pic time or two not paying attention . but that just matter getting used it . i'm really looking forward while traveling not lug around camera all necessary equipment it . battery lasted wonderfully . it really hold it charge well ( advertised ) . i went ahead bit bullet put 4 gig stick it make sure plenty room . it amazing !!! i've taken many pics lot video still huge amount space left stick . wow !!! this wonderful !!! i truly feel i made right choice this . i've taken pics restaurants , rest stops interstate , grave site my dad , video beach , etc . this camera really trick . i see i using it all time ( again , assuming it lasts well ... time tell )	1

i've used my 750 month now love it except one thing . no viewfinder . most ultra compacts don't one but bright sun it tricky see display . i " reshopped " today found canon elph 800si but - it only 3x optical zoom not 5x , it weighed more , cost $100 more , fewer features scenes ( which i really use ) , wasn't weather resistant harder " figure out " . i decided keep my 750 just learn how shield display better . it takes great shots automatic scenes easy use easy switch among . much easier than my old olympus	-1
this camera fairly easy use works well . i wish it view finder . i guess image stabilization works but am not really sure . it also moisture resistant but fortunately , i didn't test my holiday . milli	-1
i got this camera replace olympus c4000 too slow focusing bulky my needs ( shooting my toddler ) . i it 9 months now still think its great . one reason i bought it price ( under $200 ) reviews i saw web ( like dpreview.com ) . it small enough go your pocket . it used rain without fear damage . fireworks shots i took , couple seen user images this camera , where unexpectedly good handheld without tripod using fireworks program ! there couple cons , but minor expected camera this type , ie . weak indoor flash ( fix software ) , sometimes takes long low light focus , no lens protection . but all , would buy recommend again . make sure you invest nimh batteries charger you all set ! happy shooting	-1
i love this camera !! we went raging waters i picked up 2-pack sams club $18.00 . pictures gorgeous ! colors brilliant images crisp clear . i could not believe it :) i would not taken my regular camera water park i able get wonderful shots family without stress " taking care camera " . i am very pleased impressed . i took underwater shot bit blue-ish because cloudy water lack flash but still very cool shot .	1

i'm kind gadget nut i guess , so i all stuff go my canon a95 camera , including 0.7 1.75 conversion lenses canon , . 45x 3.2 conversion lenses opteka . 2 opteka lenses ( bought together ) i got only one bundled aluminum adaptor yet company ( not one shown opteka page ) . although i like aluminum because it matches camera , it not mate camera very well , some rotational slop general wobbliness . canon adaptor made hard type plastic commonly found 35mm slr lenses , so it pretty sturdy . further , when it clicks place camera , there no movement all - very secure . so ... plastic works , or nice aluminum which questionable ? well , i'm going use aluminum one strictly hold filters , i bought 2 more canon ones ( makes 3 ) lenses . i plan leave them attached 2 lenses because i hate screwing lens off .	-1
even though i not used this item yet , knowing kodak their standards i know it great finest quality .	1
i find this product amazing . i never able successfully use binoculars because my hands too unsteady . press button ,, all shaking stops i enjoy though looking through window . i find binoculars reasonably light feel natural sit comfortably my grip . lots good technology reasonable price . my only criticism neck strap . it appears impossible attach binoculars . it finally took my wife i three safety pins two pairs pliers four hands accomplish task simply attaching strap . it amazed us how thoughtless they this part design when they performing miracle stopping my hands causing image shake . now it attached i safely use binoculars without fear dropping them , it love product .	-1
try this , you won't regret it ! size would only con ... but then it far better than regular binoculars	1
there not much tell . it simple part what it designed	1
i read lots reviews this camera before i bought one , now i one i'm thrilled . it true low light issues there , but i find i don't use camera if it pain carry around . this little thing fits my pocket , takes great stills above average video . i've filmed kids more last two weeks than i couple years . don't listen videophiles who pan image quality . if you want true pocket-sized video camera , this one	1
this my 2nd digtial slr . film days , i using nikon products . my initial foray into digital photography , i switched canon ( 10d ) just see what other side fence . after three years , i switched back nikon because nikon products suits me better . no , this not " canon sucks , nikon rules " review . one thing i learned digital photography you should really decide not camera body itself , but whole lineup ... including lenses accessories . me , nikon lens line-up works me better , not because canon worse line-up ... i'm sure lot photographers find canon line-up much more sensible . now , camera itself : i've own this camera over year sold number stock images using this camera . suffice say , i'm very satisfied its performance ; i'm not going re-iterate praises that said previous reviews . what i am compelled say not-so-great characteristics this camera : iso400 above , it not very forgiving underexposure . if you not nail exposure , even raw you see noise shadow area when you try correct exposure raw software converter . this why you hear lot whining d200 owners regarding " noise . " most them don't nail exposure first time try adjust raw converter ... then bam ! noise shadows . auto white balance becomes iffy well underexposure ; everything becomes biased magenta underexposure ; this very hard correct even post-processing . nikon creative lighting system i believe feature makes nikon little better than canon artificial lighting exposure . basically , nikon designed their flash system multiple flashes mind . nikon auto-focus engine better than most canon folks tend evangelize . afs lenses i'm positive it fast any canons . if there one thing i would like change future iterations this product : i need more than one cross-type af points ! newer pentax dslr nine out its 11 af points ! this beneficial more accurate focus . so my recommendation ... if you already nikon lenses , thinking if it worth price difference jump d40/d50/d70 . it unequivocably " yes . " if you're just starting dslr system , i say look closely what nikon/canon/pentax/olympus/leica/sigma offer whole system then decide . if you decide nikon , you won't yearning own higher d2-series model this camera ; it almost same feature set lower price	1
nikon always leader photography/ camera/ lenses . others nobly tried but nikon remains high bar others only hope reach . when shift film digital began , there some speculation if nikon could keep up competition . well , rest assure not only they kept up , they continue lead way . latest example this d200 . like d70/ d80 - this solid piece equipment . just feel it tells you you holding excellent piece technology . but proof always end results again , combination nikon know-how nikon lenses lead even beginner come up excellent pictures . gone " lag shots " . you fire up shoot multiple pictures seconds so action shots all yours . without even " tweaking " picture computer program , you print top line photos home . people cited cons : expensive . yes . camera come hefty price tag but it should kept mind this piece machinery intended serious photographers . if you " vacation holiday " picture taker , then you should elect buy cheaper camera . same true difficulty multitude small buttons , dials switches . there too many they overwhelming but only someone who " point shoot " school picture taking . anyone else relish options nikon provided us d200 . room improvement ? well , battery life nowhere near good d70 which i upgraded but weak complaint you still get hundreds shots one charge . also , it would boon if flash would automatically pop up when needed like former models . so if you serious photography always one ready , this one you	1
while i am nowhere close pro , i am not stranger photography or digitals . recently i wanted something better than what i upcoming trip italy i bought lumix dmc-lx2 amazon after reading reviews , etc . it no slr , but it far more than " back-up " camera . it small enough handy without burden . ( friend we travelling digital slr 135mm zoom . she it her bag most time because it so big heavy . ) lens quality very good . absence traditional view finder very nice . tv screen back works all lighting conditions ( its adjustable ) . you little or lot technical data screen you want . it even couple nice composition templates i found useful times . i bought one after market batteries couple 2 gig cards i far more capacity than i needed 2 week trip , but second card necessary if you shoot max pixels i whole time . max jpg 2 gig card holds 350 shots . one battery all i needed so long i watched charger carefully night . sometimes current converter one use italy would shut down mid-charge . so my advice second battery switch them ou t.t his camera very versatile . it lot if one takes time study manual . ( manual not best , however ) slr beat out its zoom , but not much problem casual shooting because one crop tar out 10.1 mg shots still great photo . flash works fine . one fill flash it . i bought small slave unit works great but i never needed it . i found handy , cheap , case rei . they padded cell phone case hooks up belt or back pack . this camera fits rei case perfectly . it even side mesh pockets batteries chips . i forget price but i think it less than 20 bucks .	1
least now it :-) . during course past 10-12 months i owned 7 , that seven , digital cameras : canon s230 ; kodak v530 ; 5 different models casio's: z60 , z600 , z850 , p700 ; most recently presented my wife red s770 valentine day . i also pretty good chance evaluate canon sd450 ( my brother-in-law owns one - it actually gift my wife i him his 21st birthday ) , casio ex-s600 ( good friend mine owns one ) , panasonic dmc-tz1 ( once again , gift my wife i my father-in-law his last birthday ) . if you read any my digital camera reviews ( i've written few now ) , then you know i'm not particularly fond canon lately - i think they overrated overpriced what they offer . i also mentioned before , i've tried several different kodak models ( i used work company too ! ) , but all them turned out waste my time , say least . i became big fan casio , although not all my experiences them great . but huge gadget " freak " i am , constantly wanting new " toys " , i always craved more . over time , my tastes digital cameras changed simple point shoot type camera wishing more power manual control . so one one , i returned/sold all my cameras , after extensive ( i really mean extensive ) research , i got myself lx2 . i must say though i probably wouldn't without getting know my father-in-law tz1 first . i actually quite impressed it . powerful zoom , sharp lens , decent picture quality . i also played some other panasonic models various stores just get better feel them , well spent few hours phone , exchanged numerous e-mails friend mine who owns fz30 , who swears it . unfortunately , lx2 not available anywhere locally , but i felt i got pretty good understanding what panasonic cameras all , after some more thought consideration , i went ahead bought it amazon ( nice thing buying amazon you always return whatever it you bought , including digital cameras , within 30 days full refund , no questions asked ) . i know " noise " issue high iso , but it wasn't decisive factor me , i'm glad i didn't pay much attention it got camera anyway . it turned out one best purchases i've made long while . here why : pros : - superb design . this camera wonderfully crafted . i absolutely love black ! it gives camera nice , clean , professional look . i don't think i'll buying silver camera soon after this one ; - intuitive controls , menus . i charged battery , put it into camera , started using it taking pictures right away , without even going through manual once ; - load features , including large , bright , widescreen lcd ; wide angle , super sharp leica lens 4x zoom ; mega ois - optical image stabilization control ( optical means it mechanically , which true way doing stabilizing , comparing other cameras where it " tricking " camera into using higher iso ); many more . addition , it joystick easy access different menus , number manual controls , well provides ability shoot raw format ( more later ); - it comes silkypix developer studio software working camera raw files . someone who not familiar raw - it " pure " , camera specific picture format . it varies upon manufacturer , meaning canon raw different nikon or panasonic raw , example . it " pure " sense it much better quality than standard jpeg ( jpg ) , doesn't suffer loss information , such white balance , or brightness . there lot more raw than , i'm not going go into details right now . what i want say , however , previously owned camera which supported raw format ( casio ex-p700 ) , i must tried dozen different raw editing software packages , including products adobe , ulead , arcsoft , photofiltre , picture window pro , acdsee , lightzone , image broadway , more . silkypix delivered far best results all . only one i would probably put next it bibble ; - noise - what noise ?! i really hate it when i hear people complaining noise this camera ( after it tried myself ) , or any other compact digital camera matter . you really na�ve you think you get absolutely no noise your images using compact digital camera ? think again . you might noticed i've used word " compact " several times here . i've it purpose - it inevitable compact digital camera produce some noise . some cameras better than others , but no matter how hard you try , you see some . this camera no better or worse than any other one i've had/tried . higher iso ( above 400 ) , it slightly more visible , but who right state mind using anything over iso 200 compact digital camera , such this one , anyway ? i always mine set 100 . if i feel it doesn't get job , i shoot raw ; - picture quality very good . yes , it take some time getting used , but once you familiarize yourself everything this camera capable , you achieve spectacular results , especially if you don't mind doing some post processing . much i like everything this camera offer , there , however , some things kind irritate me . here short list bad things this camera , otherwise known ascons : - first all , this camera actually somewhat misrepresented . it advertised 10.2 megapixel camera , which not entirely true . 10.2 mp resolution available only 16:9 ( wide ) aspect ratio . two more ratios available - 3:2 , more conventional 4:3 , but those offer 8.5 , 7.5 mp resolutions respectively . so if you compare this camera others don't widescreen format , or if you prefer shoot only regular 4:3 mode , then this camera should only referred 7 mp digital camera ( because not all pixels actually effective ) . obviously , panasonic aware it , marketed it higher pixel count purpose , boost consumer interest ; - i expected see compact digital camera . what i got instead actually smaller compact camera than i expected . i really surprised see how small , yet convenient hold operate , camera body . what i didn't like , however , lens . not lens itself , it actually quite superb , but fact it sticks out . i like cameras lenses retract all way back camera body . i realize it would probably loose some features , like wide angle , perhaps zoom , but i still wish it . it would so much more ... umm ... compact ?! way it actually makes it quite difficult find right case it . almost impossible , i should say . i've tried few , but they either too small or too big . i just can't find one would fit right . i put order slx1b case it , which specifically designed fit lx1 , lx2 models , but i hear they not good . we shall see ; - i'm not big fan pop-up flash . i always keep forgetting open it when i need use it . it also seems bit flimsy . i'm treating it carefully i , but i just can't stop thinking it might break soon ; - i hate lens cap !!! there , i said it . it probably just one those small annoyances keep frustrating you until you get used it , but now i'm not really happy it . summary :d espite very few minor negatives , i think lx2 probably one best , most innovative cameras market today , i sure am glad one . it offers more than any other camera same price range , even compete some dslr when it comes picture quality . if you someone like me , who wants more control and/or learn more digital photography , or dslr user who just needs solid backup carry everywhere , then this camera not overlooked ! highly recommended	-1
i chose this camera specifically because advertised in-camera red-eye reduction fix . i new baby like any proud parent , take loads photos him . it pain fix red-eye manually photoshop , but same time i don't want lug around ( or learn how use ) slr type camera . i thought coolpix s9 would solution my problems . while photos very crisp clear , red-eye worse than my old casio digital camera flash really washes out indoor photos taken night . fact flash so bright it makes my son turn away camera , so pictures didn't red-eye all back his head ! i returned this camera am renewing my search something meet my needs	-1
we purchased panasonic vdr-d100 our first video camera after birth our daughter . we wanted ability record directly dvd , playback our dvd player able edit our computer . just last reviewer stated ; getting dvd-rw discs recognize our computer main problem . we wanted able this so we could simple editing functions like dividing combining camera , but then embellish little transition shots cleaning up video our computer . we also wanted upload video through youtube online our blog . after little research working csrs panasonic , we able figure out we needed 1 ) driver 2 ) authoring software 3 ) software recognize play dvd-rw our computer . less than $20 ( including shipping ) panasonic sent us dvd-movie album se 4.2 , which included driver ( reads dvd-rw , but no editing allowed ) dvdfunstudio 2.4 ( authoring software , which allows editing ) . after tinkering it hour i realized manuals ( pdf program ) not very easy understand novice like myself , so i opted forego authoring software microsoft moviemaker . i needed dvd-movie album se 4.2 though regardless able recognize dvd my computer . less than $20 -- wasn't bad all . my review editing focused because major downfall camera . i wanted share how we got around downfall how pleased we result . i created my first edited video our daughter able save it my computer , upload it through youtube our blog , then save it regular dvd ( get it off our computer ) re-use dvd-rw disc save us little cash . i don't know enough video cameras tell anyone if it good or not , really . it inexpensive it well my shaky abilities , so we very pleased . it decent mic fair low lighting situations .	1
i would not necessarily agree previous reviewer assessment it lightweight . i guess it relative , but three lenses i own my d80 it heaviest ; although not so much it hassle carry . i found this lens great lot different situations landscapes portraits . one thing though , heed manual , scott kelby book , advice turn vr off when shooting this lens tripod . one thing note , this lens hard come vendors who some stock charging premium over msrp . you decide if premium worth it ( i decided it ) or if you want get it up $200 cheaper waiting several weeks months . eventually nikon get enough into marketplace , but they aren't there yet	1
half price i could find local store . two quick release units . seems great product	1
these binocs very similar ones they replaced cost 5x much . old ones got tossed because they showing double image after living my backpack 2 years or so . bushnells may or may not quality optics more expensive units but " permafocus " or infinite depth focus makes it so you just pick them up look . if what you looking further than 75 ' away it clear . this really great when multiple users using them you don't reconfigure them each persons eyes . it also good scanning wide area you don't adjust focus close or far . this also makes them great watching sports where things move fast . i decided try these because we some older 10x50 units use same " permafocus " design under different brand got bought bushnell they working great over 10 years . i hope i able say same these .	-1
i really like perma-focus attribute this product . we use it nature watching while hiking vacationing . it good able pass binoculars back forth others without losing subject while adjusting focus each time . only drawback difficulty holding binoculars steady when viewing due magnification . best binoculars we've	1
i actually purchased 2 these christmas presents . i gave one pair my son " early christmas " gathering my husband so enthused quality , i ordered pair him .... received them before christmas ! per my husband : " very good quality ... compact so they take up very little room glove box my car !	1
used this trip hawaii - brought lava much closer ( looked great night ) . it not difficult focus , provides clear images . i not disappointed least . compact size makes it pocketable - perfect any traveler/casual user . recommende	-1
this my first telescope . i looking inexpensive one , but i didn't want cheap toy . i researched every telescope i could find under $250 category bought this one based reviews amazon , which appear given this telescope highest rating its price range . i'm very satisfied it . no complaints . telescope appears well built impressive features price , most notably parabolic mirror . it small enough easily portable easily set up table or milk crate . all you attach finder scope it ready use right out box . mine needed no adjustments . red dot finder scope makes aiming telescope simple . one more difficult aspects shopping telescope trying determine just what image would look like actual use . never used one before , specifications comparisons little use me , so i'll try describe what you expect see starblast : smaller magnification eyepiece shows moon sharp detail , you clearly see craters surface features . when you look moon telescope , its features seem three-dimensional compared any photographs you may familiar . larger magnification eyepiece , moon image more than fills field view , you see individual surface details . however , this larger magnification more suitable viewing more distant objects . example , while looking orion , i clearly saw what appeared cloud surrounding one stars . little research i determined i found great orion nebula . cool ! this why i bought telescope - see things i would never known looking around pair binoculars	1
i agree all previous reviews . i've owned number telescopes . all honesty , i never planned getting this scope , but i changed my mind first time i looked through one star party . some reviews mentioned this little guy isn't really designed high power views . however it decent enough job it 6mm eyepiece ( 75x ) which lets you see saturn rings . where this scope shines wide field objects like pleiades , which too big seen normal telescope . i believe previous reviewer mentioned jerky motion when turning telescope . i able minimize this taking lazy susan type base apart spraying pledge furniture polish laminate surface lessen friction . biggest " con " this scope it needs set top table order get eyepiece up comfortable height . however this telescope still blows away anything i've seen costco , wallmart , etc . one thing you should aware you really go somewhere pretty dark away all lighting this any other telescope achieve it best views . ideally somewhere out country far away possible street lighting let you enjoy much better views	1

ergonomics : perfect . d200 not completely rubber-encased . there rubber where your hands need hold it , plastic where your hands rarely touch it . hand grip comfortable nicely concave where tips your fingers dig . battery door memory card door made plastic , hinge-pinned . simple slide latch opens battery door .... some warned latch could easily ( accidentally ) tripped . memory card door latch , however , uses more secure 45 degree pivoting latch . usb 2 video out/dc-in doors made flexible rubber , these doors extend into body camera hinges themselves . english language operating manual work art . each operating concept alpha ' numerically numbered pictoral diagram , page where function explained perfect english . reader quickly catch how this well thought out manual organized . i like depth field preview , mirror lock-up , multiple-exposure capability . continuous servo autofocus better job than any human following focusing any moving object . if you old manual-focus , film-based nikon slr lenses ' 70 ' 80 , except few rare exceptions , fit d200 . all these positive attributes remind me best , most highly-evolved film camera slr . no wonder so many photographers won over digital media .	1
i think point lot people not mentioning d200 quite obvious . let me first say main reason i bought d200 over d80 increase my credibility prestige amateur photographer , make other photographers jealous my kit , brag obscene amount money i spend camera equipment while my co-workers can't even pay their rent . i bought grip because i thought it looked really cool , it increased size visibility my camera other people . question really sold me d200 : strangers i might want photograph more likely say yes standing other side d80 or d200 ? people less doubts me holding this thing opposed smaller model ? which one looks cooler ? if i completely loaded would i buy d2xs ? without second thought . course i talked lot camera people making minimum wage hoping they would some technical insight purchasing nikon or other camera . course they let me down said lot bogus things me most saying something like : " d200 way much camera me . " none them knew how change exposure settings , they contented wheel " child mode , " top d80 recited this me several times if i looked like soccer mom . usual i offended human experience buying real world , especially atrocious mark up several hundred dollars , i refused help pay those employees wages . breaking point i think time associate instructed me buy one camera over other because , " when she dropped this camera it broke other one didn't . " so i turned internet where i only say hi ups man he leaves . i studied studied all things technical , sometimes just staring pictures cameras long periods time without blinking . i poured over thousands photographs taken all kinds cameras amassed photographic library while i decided . basically i went way overboard let decision buying camera engulf my life until i dreaming it . so one night i just bought d200 after fence over d80 or d200 . after two days it arrived i impressed it . thing literally cold hard photographic machine . after broken d50 i firstly impressed size , then secondly all dials switches change things i used dig through menu get . thirdly i liked blazing fast 2 frame rate . when i go out night i snap 50mm f/ 1.8 onto it crank iso up . lot people forms complaining noise high iso d200 but i thought it fine . i feel most people camp want perfect clarity all way up into highest isos but i think artistically limiting . i read one scathing review written veteran film user saying basically high iso digital lot less graininess than film basically saying d200 step up but some people still want complain . far d200 goes versus d50 iso 1600 it leaps bounds better my opinion . noise way reduced without nr there isn't pixel chunkiness i found d50 high isos . thing stands out d200 enhanced colors . reality ultra vivid setting d200 makes lot things look sort fake , but it make people who don't sun tan look like they one which plus my opinion . it make your dull green lawn look like lush paradise , skies ultra blue , reds spectacular . i remember when i used d50 i would steer away photographing violets red roses because it would blow them out , not so d200 . some reason coming point shoot it always used annoy my d50 didn't bw or sepia . d200 bw but no sepia . nerds forums would just say , " use cs2 , or photo editor , " but i say no because i should able everything camera . viewfinder so awesome . i literally hated electronic viewfinders d50 viewfinder so small it hindered my framing times . d200 big bright viewfinder huge lcd sucks down batteries like nothing . far my evolution goes photography sometimes i feel like i literally climb into viewfinder because its so big compared what i used . like i said grip awesome i really like it . i kind like many accessories possible kind steered me away d2xs into d200 . watching percentage marks count down batteries drain always fun . best thing d200 little things like because they make me feel like i greater control over my pictures because i know exactly how many i take . conclusion buy d200 over d80 i am really happy it i am not happy anything . if you're trouble considering what you want photographically try pull yourself away forums outside sources really consider what got you into photography first place where you intend go it , i think important part . advertising gear collecting never made anyone better artist	1
this camera deserves 5 stars if you need camera easily fits your pocket or purse ready use whenever picture or movie moment arrives , even under water . considering varied picture taking situations , action , lighting conditions , performance beyond my expectations . only significant limitation seeing display bright sunlight or under water , even when screen set its brightest . however , aiming intuitive enough i never missed shot i able change modes even under water ( but i practice switching underwater wide 2 movie ahead time ) . one feature would improvement would ability zoom while taking movie . i received this camera just couple days before leaving cruise so i didn't any time practice it . careful not your finger front lens , especially under water where you may not watching screen . also aware when you zoom movies image movement also magnified . wide angle underwater movies much better than full optical zoom ( digital zoom off ) . after couple days controls easy use change modes review pictures movies . i used 1 gig cards highest resolution which provided 240 pictures or 40 minutes movies . switching back forth easy . movie recording continue until card full or battery runs out , not just short clips . my clips too short until i comfortable i would not quickly fill up memory card or run out battery . under water pictures superb natural shift color toward green . i recharged battery every other night . battery able take 100 pictures 15 minutes movie recharges . i recommend spare battery it indicate it getting low couple times ran out once . camera also used daylight , inside , without flash , even night shots ( auto setting better than night scene harbor lights night . camera steadied railing ) . i purchased lanyard metal clasp sports authority dollar which provides very secure leash . lanyard around my neck i could tuck camera my shirt pocket . i always ready next picture opportunity without worrying dropping it . i'm very pleased picture quality although it may not match camera much larger lens system , but it great able take pictures movies when i would not my larger camera available . 15 fps movies not match 3ccd digital video camera , but they acceptable . i even recorded short clips during live theater performances ( screen brightness set its minimum ) i pleased quality this tiny camera .	1
i olympus 770 sw ( not 720 sw ) , sure ... i like it . i five digital cameras before , this one terrific . considering it sub-compact pocket camera , image quality fine ( not equal digital slr , but i don't want carry around big box like dslr ) . shadow detail especially impressive . operation smooth intuitive . screen fine , even outdoors . shutter lag , big concern mine i like photograph my kids sports , minimal zero if you prefocus . number custom scene settings impressive . i bought it because waterproofing shockproofing , because prior good experience olympus over years , but i'm just happy pictures it takes under normal circumstances too . few gripes stop me giving camera 5 stars : 1 . battery cannot recharged when it camera . total $80 or so , you get external power source cable , together they let camera run long time without draining battery , but they don't charge battery . battery life fine day normal shooting , but if you use camera actively , every single night you pretty much unlock case , take out battery charge it , then remember put battery back next day . each charge takes 5 hours . i'm going take same $80 instead buy two extra batteries comfortable -- one camera , one reserve me , charging home . even so , it take some planning thinking keep batteries ready all time vacation . it would much nicer holster or charging socket case . 2 . case actually smaller than it needs . it could significantly bigger still fit my shirt pocket , which my standard size requirement . it , advanced engineering impressive pack all features tiny box , but camera more expensive than need , lens smaller than it should ( depending zoom position , lens f/ 3.5 f/ 5.0 , which pretty weak ) , it harder hold camera than need , if case bigger , there would room nice little charging socket too . 3 . there indeed background , almost mechanical noise introduced when filming videos . it probably filtered out , it very constant very low pitched , but it mildly annoying . 4 . time shots too long -- it takes several seconds save each shot full resolution . 5 . you use internal memory only if there no memory card slot . given slow transfer speed card , it sure would nice able save dozen or so shots very quickly internal memory then transfer them memory when you time . all , though , i'm really looking forward using this camera forthcoming sea kayaking snorkeling trip this summer . one camera , i'll able take snapshots above below water , also modest videos underwater ( there special scene selection just )	-1
i purchased this my kids grandma who doesn't or want digital camera but loves show off pictures . i currently use kodak software so i no trouble loading pics onto internal memory . trick tag your pics favorites then you need sync transfer them picture viewer . software recognized viewer right away . i it all loaded less than hour which included picking out pictures put it . usual kodak , screen crisp clear unlike other viewers , little larger than say magpix which i also considered . only draw back it cannot hooked tv not take regular batteries . overall , i very pleased most everyone who i showed it said - i want one . it perfect grandma throw her purse even comes leather case	-1
while i agree tutorial could better , instructions could easier , this still excellent product . far needing make pictures " favorites " before they transfer , manual * very * clear . anyway .... if you encounter problems loading pictures , all you copy paste them one your kodak albums into your viewer album . yes , moving pics 1 time pain , but it only worst-case scenario it works just fine . regarding viewer itself , i can't say enough nice things it : it small , but nicely-sized screen ( easily big enough view pictures ) , it zoom feature , nice carrying case so nothing gets scratched , it still easily fits into pocket ( certainly pocketbook ) . don't get me wrong ..... you shouldn't expect same kind quality you'd get looking standard 4x6 print photograph . but then , i would sincerely hope you didn't expect 2.5 inch screen . i bought one my father loaded it pictures before giving it him . i liked it so much , i then bought one my wife mother day !. one caveat ( me it small one ) , they advertise it hold 150 pictures . i wouldn't expect more than 100 . i found when i reduced resolution sufficiently 150 pics fit , photos looked pretty poor . but getting 100 no problem . i'm also willing admit this may simply my lack digital-photo expertise someone else * could * get more photos it . regardless , i still think it excellent value	1
this very nice tripod $15 plus shipping handling . i very pleasantly surprised . screwed into both my digital camera my camcorder . it folds up nice size very lightweight , but sturdy even when fully extended	1
i bought this camera trip down under couple month ago i really impressed image quality . it takes great low light pictures steady shot technology works really well longer shutter times . camera very small but feels solid hand due excellent construction unlike some casio ultra-compacts . well worth extra cost	1
haven't chance use it alot since purchasing it . still learning many features camera offers . although , bulkier than most smaller digital cameras , it easy handle but quality pictures capabilities camera more than make up size/weight . love it . most anything it .	1
i , like most people drawn this camera its incredible 28-420mm lens its 3.5 inch lcd screen . however i didnt like max aperture 8 . but i gave it chance anyways . first day i took it outside took few snapshots iso50 , which comes handy . iso50-400 fine me . basically this great camera but here some things people forget or ignore till its too late . -aperture max 8 . might too small more professional users . -write time raw 15 seconds tiff 25 . ( supported http://dpreview.com/reviews/samsungpro815/page4.asp )-tiff function not much better than jpeg it takes 25 seconds write . -works worse than most cameras dimly lighted areas(shutter speeds sink down 2.0 " 1/3 etc . ) . but you easily avoid this opening flash . overall this camera wonderful . it some problems but i find good outweighs bad landslide . just remember its 28-420mm zoom . think all possibilities . o yea it 3cm macro actually works well . props samsung camera well	1
if you like many videographers , you more than one battery . it easy start charging one , forget other . this baby charge two batteries time . or one if you like . i charged fp-960 clone fp-970 same time . sony says it ok though web info doesn't say it supported . infolithium batteries practically tell charger it , so it safe . naturally , charging two once takes twice long . if one battery finishes first , it trickle charges light goes out . thus allowing faster charging other battery . full charging hour after light goes out . i recall it max 1000ma so , there less chance over heating batteries during charging , thus minimizing damage . aside slower dual charge , there nothing bad i say it . folding plug prongs makes it very easy pack . it lacks car adaptor , but doesn't seem needed when you two fully charged batteries . no serious user info-lithium batteries should without it	1
would give 3.75 or 75% rating this new camera olympus . full review found [ ... ] overall camera feels good hold not seem all fragile . however , sp-550 too large purse or pocket use lacking features image quality would make it ideal dedicated camera intermediate advanced users . so target market hobbyists who avoiding advanced prosumer dslr models , yet wanting more features zoom than current crop shirt pocket cameras offer . photos not give sense crisp sharpness i hoping . noise issues , many which dealt post-processing , still abundant , may main contributer soft feel sp-550 images . all , i think image quality going sp-550 main downfall among serious photographers . contrary , strongest appeal casual photographers who simply take vacation family snapshots occasionally need longer zoom or wider lens . photographers who embrace sp-550 eventually want ability explore more advanced photography techniques find camera good stepping stone	-1
camers works well . takes great pics easy use lot extra features . great price . very pleased	-1
i lot research before buying my first digital camera . i wanted quality camera , i went back forth $300+ under $150 camera . i chose this one because i figured $140 , 5mp , 3x optical zoom , i would use it year then get new one not feel gipped . well , camera so great ! i knew nothing digital camera , instructions use language i'm not familiar , but camera very user friendly . it takes some tinkering , but it easy figure everything out . pictures come out crystal clear . different picture scene modes make some creative pictures . i travel lot , i love go out clubs bars , party moonlight dance till sun rises , i love outdoor indoor sports ... this camera light , small , i keep it my pocket , it takes great pictures . i mac computer , so cd didn't load .. but all you connect camera computer icon pops up . little copy paste , easy . battery life good . i like fact it used aa batteries , because when travelling overseas , it easy buy batteries , more difficult make sure you find outlet charge your camera . after 4 days using it continuously , battery still little over 1/2 full . i little concerned optical zoom , thought maybe i should invest camera more ... well , after taking picture house , i able zoom read words post-it note front door- 3x plenty ! i highly recommend this camera	1
i like this camcorder because 2 options no other camcorder . 1 . take pictures2 light front let you shoot night . i highly recommended buying this camera	-1
hp photosmart m527 all around well built camera , espicially considering price it purchased t.t he body all metal it honestly built like small tank . it feels good strong your hands . weight camera also very evenly balanced , so you hold it one hand get clear shots almost any situation . ergonomics overall design also help this . every button camera accessed just your one hand . screen very nice , bright , colorful , even lowest brightness setting . i really don't problem it " only " 2 " . i can't imagine situation where " small " screen would negatively impact ability accurately frame shot . image quality , price , also fantastic . shots little noisey . but honestly , how many cameras this price range not produce noisey pictures ? considering price , image quality great . sure , it doesn't look good canon costs extra hundred dollars . but doesn't mean image quality bad . noise disappears completely when you shrink picture down fit email . afterall , you're not emailing friends pictures 3.3 mb size each , you ? ;) when printed out , using photo printer or getting them professionally , prints very colorful good detail , definition , color saturation . they definitely able sit next all your other framed prints , or go photo album , only you ever know it digital print because nobody else able see difference quality . camera also offers multiple shooting modes help improve image quality certain situations . example , it " portrait " mode which help look closeups dramatically . it also obvious " night " mode which take care any dark or murky pictures low light . there " beach snow " mode which help you those high contrast shots bright lighting . it macro mode which obvious uses . you also manually adjust certain other parameters , such iso speed . however , you cannot adjust shutter speed or more advanced settings like . but if you find your pictures aren't exactly what you want them , there definitely modes help you get quality you desire . camera also decent movie mode . it record roughly 30 minutes slightly better than vhs quality video , sound , 512mb memory card . it not very good low light , but it good those quick moments when you out wish you video camera . however , you cannot zoom or out while recording . you adjust zoom before after recording . but not during . camera also very extensive photo editing features built-in , like famous " slimming " effect , you other things like add borders . it also very thorough help system . there only couple minor gripes i this camera . first battery life . real world battery life 100 shots two alkaline batteries . so get some rechargables or lithium batteries . second gripe memory card slot right there batteries . so little bit pain if you use memory card reader instead hooking camera up your computer transfer pictures . overall its great camera price , long you keep you realistic what expect . you're getting complete package not very much money . not many other cameras under $200 price range offer such complete package . if you're looking great camera cheap built well ton features , this definitely one look . however , if you want absolutely pristine image quality , you're better off looking $250+ canon powershot a6x0 series . me , this camera one built like tank get taken me everywhere i go . but i keep higher quality canon around those times when image quality more important than quick , yet good , shot	1
i am impressed how easy this camera use . picture quality good nic battary came w/ it keeps charge 2 weeks w/ steady use . only problem lens cap won't stay o	-1
sr300 fantastic camcorder price still shots amazing . definitely worth buy . i am no professional . all i looking convenient camcorder easy use . i researched days torn ccd cmos , brands all other technical details features i probably never use . finally convenience not use tapes or dvd some technical specs lead me sr 300 . i love touchscreen operations . ease copy files over storage disks quickly conevnient ( offcourse , i wish i not use shoe ) . video quality great both indoors outdoors . however complete darkness , camera struggled focus ...... my eyes too .	1
10mm sigma versus 12mm nikon , it costs around half much . deal . hsm great focusing , works my d40 which only supports af-s type lenses . 5.6 narrow end unfortunate , but you don't buy this lens shoot 20mm . you handhold wide-angles slower shutter speeds anyways . lens cap once again sigma end-pinch , which i quickly replaced nikon center-pinch , practice i've begun all my sigmas . aware there optical distortions most wide-angle lenses , but most time they aren't much issue . when they , application like ptlens great job fixing it up . i've really become fan sigma lenses , they seem offer such great value . i'm sure nikon probably slightly sharper , but i don't see noticeable difference . i see difference 10mm 12mm , though , over $400 difference	1
set wonderful , but case so big it not confortable carried	-1
handling portrait shots ( vertical format ) improved . this because battery grip its own shutter button mode dials . battery grip d200 , camera size closely approximates nikon d2x . weight also understandably increases , but i think it helps keep camera steadier ; especially shaky hands when wind blowing hard . this battery grip ideal travel , because if you run out both batteries , you load up six aa batteries into grip keep making photographs . it well-made , sturdy accessory i highly recommend	1
very nice accessory d200 . doesn't add whole lot weight but it officially make d200 plus battery pack ... slightly taller than d2x , just slightly . this main sub control dials plus multi function button . must sports shooters people larger hands who want more space their pinky	1
i ordered this product through amazon recevied it promptly . product itself robust works very well . it however , very difficult get good focus . i usually get good service/product when ordereing amazon but this time i bit dissapointed . i ordered " new " unit not used one . product came opened box origianl product packaging missing . obviously used returned item . you would expect more when paying $276.00 item . i would returned it but it seemed work fine . i am happy product but unhappy amazon sending me used goods saying it new	-1

i really hedged sky caddie rangefinder . i've used both now convenience sky caddie hard beat constant readout yardage . however , given fact i often find myself " unique " locations any given course , there much said able shoot specific target get distance , which sky caddie doesn't allow you . sometimes you need odd distances lay ups , getting ball back play , etc . short , i would recommend this product . it easy use , appears very accurate . definite time saver course	-1
it light ; 6x magnification ; easy use . this little tool great any golfer . you must know yardage before you select correct club . how far it either top bunker next green or flagstick ? next , you just then need pull club get you there . fits your belt through loop safe carrying case or use supplied clip attached case your golf bag . these new laser rangefinders better than ever lower price than previous models . love it	1
while manual little vague how remove " o " ring used seal camera housing , i figured it out . not really hard . i applied gel . took it 45-50 feet 3-4 times it worked wonderfully perfectly . no leaks , no condensation , no brainer actually . it took great pictures . i would add messing digital camera when you're diving makes buoyancy especially interesting when trying close ups octopus tucked away reef . how set up canon nice underwater shoots definitely something take some time . but all means buy this . i diving 10 years this works great . recommended highly	1
i took this guam pictures videos came out awesome .	1
panasonic seems altered design somewhat . case i got looked little different image this page . badge says " panasonic " , not " lumix . " not big deal . if you want attach this case your belt or your backpack , though , you're going find or buy mini-carabiner , because contrary what some product photos suggest , this case not come one . see " customer images " what my case looks like	-1
it chore find case fit lx2 there protruding lens fit either too tight or totally unusable . this case perfect it appears made just lx1 or lx2	-1
excellent quality/price/speed delivery ... works better/faster then one came camera ... would definately buy again , this vendor , if need ever arose . ( i don't expect it ever .	1
i bought this amazon am thoroughly impressed . field view fine , you see ton detail within reasonable range . i turned out lights my room , looked out window it my pool ( 20 feet away ) saw ripples water . i aimed it up sky , saw line incoming airline traffic i couldn't see otherwise . i took it down basement -- pitch black -- used infrared illuminator could read text off boxes . taking it outside , i could see clearly houses across street , cars , dogs outside -- just ton stuff . remove gear my eye i see little nothing . thing beaut . my only concerns how long it last hold up . light damages this type technology if handled improperly , i'm hoping generally careful use no abuse keep this thing purring long time . power source convenient too --- two double aa all you need	1
its sleek easy use . it takes great pictures alot feature	-1
i own nikon coolpix 3100 camera no complaints it , except fact its size ( even though it fairly small ) pain carry around when you want take pictures . looking much thinner camera , i came across this one quite pleasantly surprised its size , its ability take really great shots ! i'm merely birthday - holiday type picture taker , but this camera definitely enable me take more pictures , because i'll carrying it around my pockety whennever i go somewhere might provide photo opportunity .	1
works great , easy use store . it just what i need	1
i love my camera after year it my purse it gotten some pretty good scratches it . case small enough not take up too much space my purse , but its still not small enough fit snugly around my camera . it perfect long trips where i would need extra battery memory card case camera . still great buy smallest case i found this sized camera .	-1
just few notes using this camera after owned hp , olympus , sony digital camera . 1 . nikon no manual focus mode but autofocus not bad . if you lot low light work , camera infrared focus beam like sony better . infrared beam , camera focus total darkness . 2 . manual only mentions sd memory cards 1 gb but store let me try 2 gb , x60 card it worked almost doubling number photos increasing movie record time 30 minutes highest quality , 640x480 resolution , 30 frames/sec mode . my camera firmware version 1.0 so it likely all l6 use larger memory . one person reported it take 4 gb memory ( not sdhc type but plain sd ) . i cannot verify however . 3 . some reviewers here noted slow writing times memory but remember speed depends not only camera but speed memory . most sd cards no speed indicator write 1.5 mb/sec . high speed cards mentioned manual x66 ( means 66 times 150kb/sec ) which achieve write speeds 10 mb/sec . 4 . l6 zoom during movie mode but zoom digital not optical . also , you hear focusing mechanism noise soundtrack movie mode . 5 . batteries go dead most inopportune times , camera uses common aa plus . 6 . l6 only one metering mode unlike some cameras switch spot center weighted average . many scene modes make up this but one caveat . blur warning available non-scene mode not work scene mode . 7 . macro mode pleasant surprise . both my sony nikon focus same distance macro mode but there big difference results . sony achieves close distance wide angle mode . maximum zoom , sony requires moving camera back object . nikon opposite . it requires moving back ( not much sony ) wide angle it meets its close focusing distance specification maximum optical zoom . 8 . battery compartment . l6 locking latch battery compartment door door opens pulled out towards front camera . it may not seem like much unless you owned olympus which battery compartment door bottom no latch opened sliding long dimension camera . many times i would reach my pocket find door open batteries fallen out camera .	-1
i really don't too much add other reviewers , except i really fun using this camera . i've various digital cameras years ( mostly canon series ) but none come even close 3 " screen . you really see your composition . plus camera small fast ... so i keep it my shirt pocket pull it out get shot off quickly . i find screen gets smudged easily , but i just clean it more often ... i don't really mind extra work cleaning , i imagine it would like like washing your ferrari every sunday .	1
i much larger camera years but introduced canon sd630 friend . i fell love it instantly began looking one . during my search , i discovered sd750 released . so i waited . i just got it less than 24 hours ago i am not disappointed ! 3 inch lcd great ! it works well even sunny day . i admit getting my fingerprints all over it regularly driving me crazy but it cleans up easily lense cleaning cloth . camera takes dynamite pictures i love macro mode . camera fast too , much faster than my old four year old model . it starts up fast , shoots fast , stores fast . i shot some pictures dusk last night found camera well low light well . one thing worries me little flap covers usb connector . maybe it just me , but i feel like i am going break it . instead using usb cable , i go buy memory card reader download pictures . other than little detail , i love camera so far . i found menus reasonably intuitive , which i like . i don't care reading manual ( who ? ) most functions easy remember even if i only use them once while . this going great little camera me	1
i've c6 celestron some time . i wanted something easier move set up . this firstscope works great kids . easy set up very clear optics . price , you can't go wrong ! moon , venus saturn kids wanting see more !	1
only trouble this product it very hard pick up flag any distance . you generally use trap ( or person green ) get distance flag . otherwise , we've found this very useful easy use tool	-1
i don't know how i played golf before i bought this . what i thinking ??? no more adding or subtracting or just plain guessing . time group front walked off green , i exact yardage pin , right iron my hand ready fire . unfortunately , laser range finder doesn't help you hit greens any better , but i am pin high every time ! it so much fun	1
this 3rd digital camera i use , it really impressive . here highlights : -first off i loved video feature , you get decent 640x480 sound , since camera so small , you'll always able capture those special moments , it also comes usb cable connect pc cable connect camera t.v ( video audio out)-the rechargable lion battery also comes charger very nice feature , digital cameras notrious battery drainers , i separate budget batteries ( aa ) my former camera , those aint cheap ! - so you wont worry this this one . -it also voice recorder so you record notes when you taking still photos . negative sides : - you need buy separate sd memory because high resolution stills videos take lot memory , you'll need least 512mb , better yet go 1gb . -the special effects button back camera kinda useless , it turn pictures into monochrome , b/w . sepia etc . or negative , _ biggest negative thing i found it takes way too long actually capture picture even low res . flash goes twice red eye reduction ( very impressive results ) but whole process slooow , so you end up not taking shot you intended , i am still trying figure out how disable this feature so it takes photos faster . this may only real negative feature this camera .	-1
price size i am very pleased digimax l6	-1
pirate scope works advertised . " leather " fake or low quality stitching not great . optics good , extras weak . shipping good too . seller delivered advertise	-1
my brother bought this frame his wife 2 months ago . he liked it so much he suggested we get one our parents anniversary . so he it shipped my home because i'm family historian most pictures my folks would want . i selected 2900+ pictures converted them 640x480 . all 2900+ pics plus 15 glenn miller songs fit 512mb sd card 50mb still vacant . i liked frame so much i just bought one my wifes birthday . really good looking ; both actual frame images . i'm fairly serious digital photgrapher i didn't think 640x480 resolution could look this good . looks much better than i expected . sounds just ok , but what you'd expect size speakers fit something this size	1
easy set up , looks nice much brighter than 8 " kodak frame target	1
it fits camera perfectly . it really cute not bulky . it not just ordinary camera case everyone else . it classy .	1
this case saved my ** my camera ! i drop my new camera but thankfully it case -- you could cushion when it hit floor -- thankfully !! i clip camera my belt away we go . its awesome -- so v550 camera !	1
i seen other lenses sold quite bit less , but decided against attaching cheapo lens camera i spent lot money - me anyway , since i'm beginner . kodak well worth investment , pictures look fabulous . it not massive amount magnification , but my understanding anything more than 1.5 pretty much useless due picture distortion . i'm attaching pair pictures . both lens , but i included first give idea distance i shooting . i used monopod both . like uren noted previous review , this quite large piece gear when attached kodak adaptor . plan picking up larger case camera , adaptor , lens . tripod or monopod also recomended , any shakiness your hand also magnified higher zoom	1
my brother delighted his lens you got it here before christmas which made me very happy	1
lens worked wonderfully my kodak z740 camera not problem . i wanted light camera better pixel shoot small music festival events , however obtaining lenses become problem . i found this lense it worked beautifully no problem whatsoever . it little weighty lense you definitely need supplemental flash especially night shoots , but during day , close-ups brilliant	-1
jvc gr-sxm38us super vhs camcorder great little camcorder . . . it easy use takes great video , even under very low light conditions . i am extremely pleased this camcorder . i wish , however , proper cables hook up television included camcorder . it took couple trips fry finally get right cables use my television watch my videos . far camcorder goes - i highly recommend it anyone purchasing their first camcorder , price very reasonable , well	1
i sticked sony since i got my first digital camera 4 years ago sony camera moneys worth ! this one dsc-t10 one parent who carrying much already needs pack down change . it fits my purse still space more , only thing remember buy slim fitting case camera extra battery(for those kind battery not sold everywhere ) you need one when you don't thing you need extra battery , you always run out wrong time . i recommend this one	1
this my first digital camera , i lot search finaly i decide dsc-w55 black , what i looking , small enough it my purse , lot functions , very easy import pictures my computer , you only connect camera usb cable you don't need install software came camera , i windows vista i didn't any problems transfering pictures , best camera price great , you choose super saver shipping save more . you love this camera too , small , very pretty , lots options , take great pictures . some one wrote review this camera feels like plastic , that not true , looks very durable me i think good product worth every single dollar you spend . easy shoot pictures auto adjustment mode , start taking pictures sooner you charge battery , because this camera internal memory you buy memory card later . well hope you lots fun taking pictures , good luck ..!	1
i really love my first digital camera ! i searched i searched i finally found what i wanted . pictures crystal clear , movie playback exceptional - you only hear what you're supposed , no loud background noise or static , no muffled noise . pictures come out so clear after you take picture you zoom 5x count pores your face ! i love it ! i don't think i could ask better camera . i hope this camera last me atleast 4 years or more or until i graduate college . if one market afford it , get this camera ! there cheaper cameras but if you want get camera , get good one , doesn't mean it expensive , but my opinion you get what you pay . thanks reading . happy buying	1
pros : fantastic " straight outta box " image quality . there almost little or no shutter lag second your press shutter button . auto focus fast too . it wasn't so much this standard point-and-shoot when i looking ultra-slim camera - but most ultra-slim cameras i've tried sacrifice image quality cram much technology such little body - while boosting price up . lz7 fantastic performer . 6x optical zoom optical image stabilization ( not digital , i'm not fan " digital " image stabilization ) plus . it actually better than canon sd700is sd800is i previously tested out ( i returned both them because paying dslr body prices point-and-shoot camera outrageous ) . major plus this camera image quality . fantastic , sharp decently saturated . it one few cameras where i feel comfortable printing photos straight outta camera . i even impressed few colleagues showing some 8x10s i printed straight out my silver lz7 they shocked i didn't take shot dslr . that what i call great image quality ! cons : this quite beefy camera . age ultra-slim point-and-shoot cameras boasts same features lz7 , price i paid it , it totally worth it . use aa batteries might convenient some , but it sure contributes weight size this camera . i'm still pleased regardless . image quality pros outweigh cons this camera	1
lithium-ion batteries last longer than aa batteries , but you still need this accessory recharging . i'd suggest buying least one other battery alternate . it take 1.5 -2 hours recharge one battery fully . you also buy adapter travel overseas . you don't want stuck paradise without enough batteries lithium-ion batteries not readily available everywhere . this recharger less expensive than most	1
can't go wrong sony . great speed visual . don't think twice buying it	1
cable working perfectly . what joy able transfer video my computer . i bought tis cable used , but it showes no sign wear all . i however expect it jvc brand core filter . maybe thats what all braided sheilding . regardless , i havn't gotten any interfearence so i'm happy	1
pros : made metal screws easily into camera housing protecting lense assembly it powers up while use . inside threads outer rim accomodate filters totally protect lense damage allow you obtained filtered photos . cons : flared end cover partially occludes camera flash pattern creating small areas shadows . using external flash camera shoe solves issue . they could make flared end bit smaller correct this problem .	-1
i really enjoyed this product . it enhanced my picture taking next level . i highly recommended adding this product your camera bag . you won't regret it	1
i previously bought cheaper nikon range finder . i ended up taking it back getting pinseeker 1500 ( non slope ) . it picks up pin(doesn't need flag ) perfectly .. when rangefinders pick up pin some background clutter they always show you farthest distance . this because they optimized hunting ( picking up deer through brush ) . pinseeker always shows closer object ( optimized golf ) . it best range finder i used all who see it agree . buy it .	1
there isn't much more say here . this superb little camera , definately worth 10 cnet , not 7.0 their review gave it ! they completely got it wrong their rating because this camera definitely deserves least 8.0 ! here , it also gets my 5 stars ! far pros go this camera ( 28mm wide angle , 10x optical zoom , 3 '' lcd , , built-in lens cover ) , it exactly good it sounds ! real life needs real life situations real people loves superb photos right camera capture those moments . cons side ( no manual controls , no zoom video mode , average battery life ) , those practically only things more advanced user would care . manual controls mostly expert photographers white balance exposure settings already this camera , so i don't know what else you need . zooming video mode isn't important me since i don't particularly take much video footage . i only say average battery life because i tend look through photos i already shot pretty often without using power save lcd , therefore , that particularly what drains battery . however , you usually get @ 250-270 shots per charge , without frequent previewing . panasonic basically taken original tz1 made it even better . there not much missing this camera . i've said , 28mm wide angle leica lens , 10x optical zoom , 3 " high resolution screen , excellent image stabilization , etc . all this fairly compact camera . panasonic also improved " noise " higher iso . low light performance much better than previous panasonic models . most important this , camera takes fantastic pictures . thing i'm extremely impressed construction finish alone . just holding it your hands it screams quality feels like tank . i love it . it seriously feels like $700 camera . no exaggeration . i little worried it not able fit my jean pockets before buying it . women may issues really tight jeans but us guys no problem . it fits fine . i seriously can't believe i carry around camera 10x zoom inside my jean pockets . truly remarkable . 3 " screen amazing . you practically enjoy your pics right screen without even printing them high resolution output . image quality great , if you need extra sharpness want " canon-like look , " you could always use camera " vivid mode . " it also not much bigger or heavier than your overpriced sony . plus , here , i found it three hundred , high speed 1gb panasonic card included . what better than ?! only accessory i buy now just dmw-ct3-k , leather case specifically this camera . you really can't find perfect digital camera , but this comes close you get . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you looking great zoom camera small enough form factor , you should seriously consider dmc-tz3 . this best compact camera i've ever owned	1
i went ritz camera today took good look tz3 . i'll tell you , its pretty nice . build quality really good , previous person mentioned . body metal . dials buttons click precision , nice resistance . it nice weight it . i took some nice shots store . i must clicked off 100 pics . i'm impressed it . if you want something relatively small , powerful tough , this camera you . 10x zoom great , but such small camera it difficult hold it steady enough(at least me ) use zoom too much . i love build quality style , so i may biased . it nice piece equipment . i cannot speak photo quality only seen pics camera lcd	-1
dvx 100b cheaper than xl2 but you get more features . aside compact built xlr ports , you get optional flip out view finder which xl2 doesn't offer . if you looking non hd camera i would suggest going camera optional 24p because you'll getting your money worth it awesome feature ..	1
i bought this my mom grandma it really simple if you're using secure digital card ! just plug turn it plays . everyone complains display , but it like any other lcd display : it not perfect but it not less than i expected . it easy ( once my grandma found on/off switch ) nice piece around family gatherings ... only issue : lack instructions included . they very vague makes you not even want explore other things it may it	-1
this camera very small , sleek light . it takes great pictures lot features . only 3x zoom but zoom much farther once picture taken . i used olympus past never problem their products . :	-1
i olympus stylus 4mp loved it but wanted newer model . i purchased this 710 love it . olympus makes it so easy take pictures pre-set options image stabilization . i love smaller size this camera it easy use . there no way give it 4 1/2 stars so i gave it 5 but there one thing i don't like area usb plug . you pop off this cap ( it hangs off camera ) maneuver small end cable camera ( tight fit cap hanging there ) then pop cap back .. it just seems flimsy i wonder if cap eventually break off . 410 it much easier access this it near memory card . only design feature i don't care 710 . it great camera i am very happy purchase .	1
i just bought this camcorder am not good reader manuals . i it recording matter minutes . you format mini dvds , but easy find manual . quality recording looked great my computer screen . i bought office depot mini dvds they worked fine , great price . this panasonic great recording straight mini dvds wonderful idea . i would given it 5 star rating , but finalizing mini dvd took while you plug it , you can't this using battery . also i warned , if you use dvd-ram instead dvd-r , they not work all players they prefer work panasonic equipment . this why i opted non re-writable mini dvd-r office depot . i also bought pny sd card them card reader , all very affordable easy use	-1
i'm not going imply these best eyepieces available but they good eyepieces they incredibly affordable . they essentially celestron " omni " series plossl eyepieces , which their least expensive series retail $30 - $40 each . just eyepieces alone worth $100 . barlow lens quality piece but fairly redundant these eyepieces unless you very short focal ratio telescope . color filters good all around set but they would only useful 8 " larger telescopes then only planetary viewing . i don't care moon filter . it better than nothing , but i prefer using polarizing filter moon . so buy it case eyepieces if you get any use out rest just frosting cake	1
this worked advertised initial charge not take more than couple hours . i not used car adapter yet	1
this small camera big features . 7 megapix detail photos awesome very clear . zoom feature great but best features compact size ( fit shirt pocket ) ease control buttons . after dealing lots other digital cameras difficult use control features such deleting photo or organizing your photos , this camera proven easiest camera i ever operate . even child figure this one out . i love it	1
we took case barrier reef 6 snorkeling trips . camera worked wonderfully . there no leakage , fog during all 6 uses . only thing since it bright outside , there lot glare made it hard see lcd screen , but more camera issue than case . i would recommend this product over any disposable underwater camera . worth every penny	1
i've this product month used it go kayaking , whitewater rafting , snorkling . it keeps water out camera chamber nicely , but after rafting , i noticed small amount water entered top part where buttons . it didn't affect operation camera , no water or condensation found main chamber . i left it open few days it dried out . i not this problem while snorkling , which suggests it may due pressure camera wedged lifejacket my chest ... probably not good idea camera , but i didn't want lose it ! other items note - - neck strap it comes good adjustable- it quite small , but roomy enough inside small anti-moisture packet- operating it just easy without case , exception optical viewfinder , which cannot used- case comes clip-on diffuser flash , which works nicely plastic case distorts light without it- steel pin forms hinge case already rusted ... could due salt water , though i careful rinse it freshwater after each use ; again though , won't affect operation camera , nor integrity waterproof seala possible improvement canon consider would option adding clip-on lens cap protect surface scratche	1
panasonic seems altered design somewhat . case i got looked little different image this page . badge says " panasonic " , not " lumix .

my only complaint : built-in flashes these cameras limited range . if you're shooting dark room subject 30 feet away , it time upgrade digital slr . otherwise - this great camera	1
i two nikon coolpix 995 cameras hated them both . i also canon rebel xt which great camera more " intended " use . but canon too large tote me my last trip asia , so , advice friend , i decided i would pick up small digital camera sinapore " pennies dollar " . so , knowing nothing prices recreational digital cameras , i picked up this camera 220 usd , time , felt pretty good it ( again , same friend suggested 220 good buy ) . this place supposed electronic dumping grounds chinese production lines but i paid double what amazon it . i love camera because it reliably takes good pictures little effort inside out slips inconspicuously into my pocket when not use . i would strongly recommend buying this product amazon or one its syblings such l11 . . .	-1
simple features , i got it work it job what we need	-1
this not only ideal scope beginners but enough instrument show you new things sky years come . it sturdy simple operate . it enough light-gathering power ( more important than magnification ) reveal dim star clusters , nebulae , galaxies good enough optics show you surface planets like jupiter , saturn , mars . affordable this scope , there no reason give so much glance numerous trashy 60mm refractors exaggerated magnification claims litter market . some advice selection . dobsonians like this one come range sizes . 114mm ( 4 � " ) bit small side but still fine instrument , especially if your ability carry large objects limited . 200mm ( 8 " ) scope like this one right middle recommended range . 250mm ( 10 " ) big side , you should buy one only if you able-bodied . some advice use . viewing through telescope less like playing cd more like playing guitar . finding objects takes little bit practice . simplify it , i would suggest discarding finder supplied this scope installing two finders : 50mm " crosshair " finder plus red-dot finder aid initial pointing . you also need buy atlas ( sky telescope pocket sky atlas best available ) , red flashlight view charts without blowing out your badly-needed night vision , guidebook lead you interesting objects . these investments greatly add your enjoyment . what more i say ? this kind scope experienced observers trying steer novices towards decades . although , i recommend you your homework before buying any scope -- learn sky get know experienced stargazers who advise you -- when it comes time purchase , you could hardly better than this scope . more advice , see my encyclopedic guide here amazon , " so you want buy telescope .	1

i love this camera . i bought it my trip paris . i found it very easy use . one feature i didn't realize it video sound . i found very useful . i bought 2gb memory card go camera . one it comes doesn't hold many pictures . software easy install use . not really small enough pocket but still great camera budget	1
this my 3rd digital camera i bought this one supplement my larger 10x zoom camera . this one fits nicely into pocket or small camera bag easily take it all events or travel . i've found it takes nice photos indoors when flash used .... even when cats or dogs i'm shooting moving around . i've felt life battery set pretty good , but i've using nice rechargeable ones . definitely get set 4 , then you 2 use 2 backup set . settings pretty easy figure out change 99% my photos taken " auto " setting came out pretty good . others indicated , indoors - without flash - produce blurry photos , but that nature almost all cameras , not unique this model . glad i bought it would highly recommend it	1

these tdk 8 cm ( 3 . ) dvd-r blanks used mostly dvd camcorders panasonic , sony hitachi . i use them my beloved panasonic vdr-d300 3ccd dvd camcorder ( see my review camcorder amazon ) . these dvd-r blanks pre-formatted so all i need pop one into my panasonic start shooting . i shoot highest quality setting ( called " xp " panasonic ) which gives me 18 minutes recording time . after i'm one disk , i finalize it panasonic which makes it playable all dvd players well most computer dvd-rom drives . ( only dvd drives not compatible 8 cm discs those suck disc . these small discs must used tray-loading or cartridge-loading drives . very few people , other than some apple computer owners , those sucking drives . ) tdk discs , manufactured taiwanese company tdk , quite reliable . i've gone through two dozen not encoutnered any problems . only unknown shelf life these discs . i make backup copies my videos both hard drives regular dvd-r . because your own home video recordings not encrypted , you simply copy files tdk disc blank regular-sized dvd-r via windows explorer . it really simple . course , since these discs , they used only once . if you want rewritable rw blank , check out tdk camcorder dvd-rw 3-pack	1

pros : high quality construction , nothing it feels cheap . comes lens hood . great telephoto capability . excellent price starter telephoto lens . cons : quite bit chromatic abberation around edges 200mm-300mm . you'll definately want use tripod this anything above 100mm since there no . overall , if you want lens simply because you want wide range ability zoom far get this . if you want quality pictures however , look elsewhere . i'm thinking spending ~ $500 one canon image stabilization lenses	1
i'm just mom really nice camera ( canon digital rebel ) this lens great birthday present my husband . it so spoiled me zoom ! i recomend this any amatuer - intermediate photographer . go it	-1
we got this dvd share station wedding gift . my wife i decided not wedding lunch keep money buy us jvc everio hard drive camcorder so we could it our honeymoon first few years our new life together . we took some video burned dvd share station dvd came burner . then we edited video our computer tried burn it . it didn't work . so , we went out bought more burnable dvds . i just thought i some faulty , cheap blank dvds , so we bought some nice sony dvd + rw discs . they didn't work . i got upset checked reviews online , all them pretty much bad saying this burner didn't work . well , next day , we read instructions learned there differance dvd + dvd - discs . we learned dvd + rws dvd - rws didn't work burner , it picky which brand you use , you make sure it it dvd - formatted disc . jvc , sony , tdk , verbatim dvd-r discs ones work . ever since we learned , all our dvds burned perfectly everything great . it pain butt figuring out what wrong , but now it working , i am very impressed this burner . i hope people who problems theirs read this review try what i suggested before getting upset returning it	-1
i nikon coolpix which small but too big shove into my pocket so i bought sony . i love it small , get used making sure my fingers not within lense view . extra battery memory sticks run up cost ( but goes any digital camera ) . it easy use since i'm not much one reading instruction books yet able figure things out fairly easily . i don't movies so can't comment but straight photos turn out really well ( which surprises me since i've always really lousy photographer ) . i like i carry it me all time , which i . i wrap whole camera small cloth envelope so lcd doesn't get scratched up . i added neck lanyard usually used computer flash key so i wear camera around my neck or wrap strap around my hands just case it slips out my fingers -- camera so lightweight . only complaint i shutter door , which slides effortlessly turn camera , slides effortlessly even when you don't want it . i've used up battery many times while camera sitting my pocket ( so i always carry extra battery me ) . extra plus loading pics onto computer breeze ( no extra software needed , just cable comes camera ) . there still slight delay depressing button take picture when camera actually takes picture but it not bad nikon . i assume newer versions this camera only gotten better . well worth money ( i just wish i could lock shutter cover )	-1

i almost didn't buy this camera based all negative reviews up here amazon , but i decided give it shot it turned out i am extremely happy this camera would highly recommend it any new parents . no it not give you image good your camcorder . yes there may some static interference picture . yes it may interfere your wireless network ( just turn off camera whenever you go online , or if you feeling motivated you pretty easily tweak your wireless network so they don't conflict ) . but what you * * get self-contained wireless video camera shoot total darkness ... plus portable battery powered video monitor only $120 . it actually works set up few minutes . amazing me . also there av out mobi video monitor so you run ( included ) cable directly mobi monitor your main tv set . my wife i usually like watch one tv show before we go sleep , this one time day we relax just spend time together , it extremely useful able just hit button remote go " project runway " real time image our baby sleeping next room . you also set mobi monitor only turn when there movement - we set little mobi monitor next our tv so if we see it turn we swith main tv over see what happening our big screen . we audio monitors but able actually see your baby much , much more helpful . oftentimes our daughter fuss silently before actually waking up , so when we see her start move around we know we need get ready deal her . also you don't need " gadget dad " make this work . we just plugged ours , set frequency ( , or ) , it good go . so , if you afford $120 i would highly recommend this device . it made us much more effective parents	1

first , i couldn't decide fujinon canon then i never able take them outside try them out and/or compare them . so , i finally just bought pair canon 18x50s hoped best when they arrived i looked thru pushed button . boy , what waste several years . why didn't i buy pair when they first came out ? i could using them all this time . instead , i dithered over cost vs . results really regret fun i missed meanwhile . only difference these versus regular binocs one button . when you push it , there little click then , wow . after investing plenty telescopes , computer tracking mounts , etc ., these should much higher priority . oh yeah , they're light enough take anywhere viewing fatigue really much less than others ( especially since my hands really pretty shaky anyway i drink plenty coffee )	1

i very excited getting this since every time i take my camera beach i'm worried getting water it . when i got it i little discouraged ; it rubber liner greased up before use ( little annoying , but they give you grease , it basically just petroleum jelly , it goes easily enough ) it specifically states if you damage product while using case it not sony fault . so , i terrified still first time i used it . but after getting it all together going whitewater rafting trip where i able take pictures down whole river without worrying , i'm completely satisfied . case worked flawlessly , not drop water got , i it completely submerged more than once . took few great underwater shots . down side , i really wanting use this beach ocean , but it warns manual salt water get rubber liner , dry , leave salt crystals there damage liner prevent it working correctly . so , i guess i won't dunking it ocean anytime soon , or least until i find some replacement liners	1

it good get case strap price other places sell battery only . unfortunately , spare battery pretty much necessity camera . this case pretty nice carrying it around . it fits camera tight , so not " travel " case . it isn't made fit spare battery or charger . but , i've found you jam spare battery there camera . you completely remove camera take picture though battery fall out while you're it . strap pretty nice , but camera gets heavy around your neck after just short time	-1
i won't repeat all stuff other reviews . let me just say i bought this camera replace d100 , fine nikon dslr . i tired " lens fever " never ending . also , bulk weight all equipment tiring . 8800 some lag , just like all non-slr cameras . but , i've learned live it . i just pace myself . continuous shooting modes give you ample opportunity shoot action sports . quality pictures awesome . zoom lens gives me all i my 5 pound lens . speed isn't everything maybe this camera isn't everyone , but it meeting my needs . i'm not going back my dslr	1

i bought this tripod just few days ago through amazon.com . first , it shipped time arrived first estimate date . it got basic features , although it may not stand up wilderness , it certainly well made . all movements smooth , don't jerk all . i owned couple cheaper tripods wal-mart , paid $25 them . this only little more money , but you get lot quality price	1

this my 3rd nikon coolpix . 995 , 4500 now 8400 . excellant photos , controls wideangle terrific . nothing short what i expected . i could go its great auto manual features . however , just word what i don't like . no ability connect remote control , probably just my gripe , but would nice still utilize usb port nikon remote or after market digi-snap i used my 995 or 4500 . oh well . also , limited ability use various threaded filters len . nikon ( 3 ) selections limited . i found 37mm adapter 52 or 55mm work ... but you still watch out very carefully not cross thread putting it taking it off . lastly , when using their 3x tele converter 995 or 4500 it becomes fixed focal length no zoom all . also their 2x works well applications i use . if you live these short comings you just love output 8400 . i also adjust when using " extra fine " , getting 132 photos 1 gig cf card .	1

i used this few months now really noticed difference my photos . i nikon d50 sb-600 flash . prior this purchased i some very harsh flash effects such over exposure faces drastic shadows behind subjects . since then , i feel i able manage those effects much more easily . cost item , i would recommend it anyone who uses flashes wants mute effects some	1
i owned one previous models originally sold throughwallgreens returnable " one-time use " video camera . theory you didn't actually " own " camera . you would pay $30 it ; shoot some videos ; then return it store get dvd your videos . but course , people figured out how hack camera add usb cable download videos , so you didn't need return camera get videos . so this new psv-351 looks like " legit " model pure digitalcame out satisfy demand all people buying theolder models never returning them . smart move ! instead complaining , give pople what they want . if you can't beat ' em join ' em . even three times price what i paid my hacked versioni would easily buy legit one . i loved my hacked psv . i kept telling people " pure digitalshould sell these ! " it very simple camera . it doesn't tryto pretend more than it . it very few features . but what it it well . you push big red button it records good quality video ( quality impressive price ) . i'm big fan simple products work well -- like nintendo or ipod . this camera looks bit like toy , but it durable . this would actually make good toy kid or adult . ergonomics nice . it comfortable hold . quality construction very good . i like fact it runs two ordinary aa batteries , soyou don't need charger . i would buy one these -- or maybe even few them . buy bunch them pass them out wedding . duct tape one your motorcycle helmet . tie one kite	1
camera works fine i record performances various bands i play . sound ok ( just remember keep your fingers away mike ) , it records fairly well most nightclub situations , but if it dark , video dark well . usb connection great thing , but remember it needs disconnected via software before you jerk camera away computer . i damaged hard drive my very first use , now i only record 16min . video before i'm full . it my fault	-1

i recently purchased rebel t2 camera body only after my canon eos rebel 2000 gave its " last gasp " . i canon user since 1979 ae-1 ( i still ) . i liked fact t2 body plugged immediately into two ef lenses i owned ( 28-80mm 75-300mm ) , which protected my previous investments . i taking pictures within seconds opening package loading batteries . although i my sights set digital rebel some point soon , you just can't beat quality traditional 35-mm film photoprocessing . upgrade over eos rebel 2000 , lcd located camera back easier read . also , t2 seems more " solid " me , but lighter weight . i took older eos rebel 2000 me couple 75-mile backpacks ( which probably led its early demise ) , so i now new-found respect lighter design . final note , i also appreciated ease ordering via amazon.com . there plenty web sites offering same canon t2 camera back , including those which would saved me few dollars . but none long-standing relationship i amazon over past several years	1

sony vcl-dh2630 telephoto conversion lens compatible cybershot digital cameras ( purchased 07/17/2005 ) sony vad-wa conversion lens adapter dscw1/w5/w7 digital cameras ( purchased 07/17/2005 ) you need both . they allow you get shots camera telephoto not pick up detail . i learned this hard way when i took series shots three wolves stalking dozen caribou . i little splotches . i swore then get telephoto . you need both items function . they relatively heavy size camera . there just one magification no adjustment . so what you see what you get . it expand your use good versaltile pocket camera . i buy it again	-1
i purchased this camera looking take more manual control over my video projects . exactly what it allowed me . it right balance manual controls ( well automatic modes ) price . it given me flexibility i looking . weight balance good , controls easily accessible battery life very good	1
this unit pretty awesome especially frame . also , noteworthy thing this camera first 16 9 then encoding producing higher quality image than comparable sony model . i've actually owned precursor unit this one , gl1 , also pleased i t.t his camera hotshoe feature longest optical zoom its class . optical vs digital , optical definitely wins . this camera all-a-round useful also , this unit actually preferred camera choice many sports film-makers . if you take this thing slopes like i , strangers come up you instantly recognize unit . great kenko lenses . only actual thing i've seen it doesn't like low light , so adding vl-3 must , or vl-10 recommended . one thing watch out you must keep care camera . example , you must get yourself tape-head-cleaner . maxell good buy , but you could go oem if you want . also , don't cheap out cassettes . my 6 years using gl1/gl2 , i've always used tdk jvc tapes . jvcs come 6-pack found best buy . tdks also come 6-pack , you find them costco . more reference , i pushed this camera beyond its specification it rained , snowed , frozen point where there actually lag lcds yet , it still works like brand new . definitely good buy !	1
i agree previous poster , this lens very impressive . pictures this item not represent how big this lens actually . this thing massive heavy , yet you definately wield it without tripod . makes great addition already amazing camera . much better than using digital zoom itself , but then , digital zoom combined this lens equal 400mm . lens comes padded sony drawstring bag caps ends . definately recommended	1
this my first digital camera . prior this i simple kodak point-and-click model which pretty much quality disposible . i use much higher grade cameras work both 35mm digital . this camera gives you 5.1 mp ability though most shots only require 3mp . i like 32mb internal memory though i've also bought 256mb card traveling . 5x zoom isn't cool i initially thought it would digital zoom works sometimes not others but you must understand what digital zoom really . camera takes very clear optimal pictures . better pictures then i've taken anything else i've owned before ( some work cameras well ) . size small enough put your pocket but not too small one larger hands . different flash options shooting scenes turn difficult pictures into what you want capture . panoramic shot sequence especially favorite feature especially shoreline shots . i've also bought r-series dock enjoy its ability transfer my pictures faster charge two batteries once . this camera worth price you pay but i believe its 2005 model so it may not most up date but it great job .	1

i bought this camera my 9yr old son because price ( less than $100)and it turned out better than any canon digitals i owned . i learned log ago use rechargeable batteries , so i wouldn't let any posts regarding battery drain sway you purchase . my son autism gives this camera workout . it taken plenty abuse up 500 pictures per week past six months . video lighting modes incredible too , i get lot more " keepers " out this inexpensive camera than any i digital i owned date	1
function good , lots mode easy use . but now even s700 less expensive	-1
i pleasant surprised k10d it combines built-in image stabilization , self-cleaning sensor , easy-to-use image controls sealed body . it just fills right my hands . i'm not going repeat all good pints found previous reviews . but i want comments some " cons " . yang mi point out : " 10m not much bigger than 6m (* ist dl ) , it good but don't expect big difference ... " more pixels isn't give you better image . you wouldn't see difference 5x6 or 8x10 print . but if you want print 24x36 print this when you need more pixels . overall it great camera big step forward istds/k100 series cameras . i like k10 more controls body before bared menus . i like raw button big time . what hold me give k10d five stars it af . even af much improved ds still not fast nikon d70s . highly recommended	-1
i used this case my s80 multiple dive trips i am impressed not only you virtually every control function available but also picture quality you get . i little worried first one my dives supposedly right cases rating 130 ' . i actually logged dive 146 ' case held up fine . i knew i took risk though . just make sure you clean o-ring every so often , re-lube it soak case some fresh water once you return your dive trip you long lasting underwater housing . looking forward many more dives . weights extra , but very useful so your camera won't float up stays more steady . just make sure you strap it down your bc not loose it if you use weights :	1
usual canon produced quality product matched perfectly great camera . i this camera down 100 ft . without problem . i think this camera/case combo one best you find without spending over $1000 bucks many much more expensive units can't match it performance . my only complaint multi funtion wheel back camera not accessable when case so you cannot use most manual funtions require use wheel . like manual focus adjusting flash , exposure comp . white balance . this major consideration prosummers out there	-1
i bought this camera mostly home movies , after doing extensive research camcorders . first decision going hard-drive over dvd or tape . ease downloading videos your computer , plus fact it way most camcorders going heading near future made this almost no-brainer . then question which model buy . i chose sr82 over sr42 sr62 because extra storage capacity , improved resolution over sr42 . video resolution sr82 good enough most televisions . if you want hd video , you need spend least $200 or $300 more " entry-level " hd camera . i'm not too worried 1mp still photos because , let honest , i'm not planning use this camera take pictures ! i digital camera , which better resolution , low-light performance options than camcorder ever taking pictures . plus , it flash , which camcorders usually don't ( unless you're willing add accessory shoe external light ) . picture quality i mentioned pretty good , even low-light , camera very intuitive easy use right out box . downloading computer breeze too . get however extra battery , since one it comes usually runs out pretty fast	1
this kit all i expected more . bag easily holds my eos xt rebel both my lenses , external flash , batteries , chargers ..... room spare . bag alone worth price , battery filter great kicker	1
my initial thoughts this too expensive but when you consider quality bag canon battery , price starts become reasonable . bag high quality bag , effort give you idea what it hold i describe one load . digital rebel attached lense film based eos without attached lense two additional lenses one flash unit owners manuals spare batteries charger extra memory cards filters cables , hand shoulder straps it still additional room more gadgets toys . it tripod loops which i don't use . far canon battery , i've read other brand batteries aren't anywhere near good so getting genuine canon battery good ... i guess ... kit includes haze filter which generally considered " that nice , who cares " since they generally cheap enough considered freebie . i'm really torn 4 or 5 star rating . based quality merchandise , it would get 5 . based price , i'd drop rating . mark	-1
i agree first review posted here most part . i add i tried software not impressed . first , upon installation i received error message said software not windows certified , installation could cause my system become unstable . well , it . after installation , my system crashed daily basis . i sensed uninstalled contacted sony . they basically said it doesn't matter it not windows certified because it sony certified . alrighty then . once i uninstalled , crashes stopped . looking 3rd party sw use . it also worth noting camera equipped usb port , which i told best buy could used downloading video your pc . cable not included course . when i software installed , it not recognize camera when hooked up usb port . pdf hardcopy manuals included , usb interface poorly documented . chapters where it mentiods ieee interface , it says this must used download video . not mention usb alternative . when i took it back best buy answers , it even stumped geek squad . according sony , you select usb stream function cameras integrated menu . i still cannot get it work after following sony instructions . usually , usb ports camcorder reserved downloading still shots cameras slot flash memory . hc38 no such slot . they should left off usb port put mic/earphone jack . plan installing firewire capable expansion card if you don't one forget any ideas downloading via usb	-1
this camera great , it small compact very easy use . we love it	1
this great product , exactly what it supposed it well . it simple reasonably inexpensive . solid feeling camera . i picked up this version after disappointing experience folding model . my only beef i rotate my camera " wrong " way portrait oriented photo . this puts shutter release bottom instead top . it works , but slightly awkward me . not biggie it really help pictures due favorable position flash .	-1
i love this camera . color great , so fun makes me feel unique . screen great size , it takes great pictures . good red eye issue . menu great too , when you scroll thru things , it tells you what it so you don't memorize it all . takes fast pictures , but not one after , like i hoping . but it open fast . don't fooled big memory , you still need larger card . depending size pic you want , you take 30 50 pics memory alone . but all all i love this camera it great buy	-1
i really love my first digital camera ! i searched i searched i finally found what i wanted . pictures crystal clear , movie playback exceptional - you only hear what you're supposed , no loud background noise or static , no muffled noise . pictures come out so clear after you take picture you zoom 5x count pores your face ! i love it ! i don't think i could ask better camera . i hope this camera last me atleast 4 years or more or until i graduate college . if one market afford it , get this camera ! there cheaper cameras but if you want get camera , get good one , doesn't mean it expensive , but my opinion you get what you pay . thanks reading . happy buying	1
i've owned nikon hr-e5700 lens hood almost long i've owned my nikon 5700 . lens hood screws quickly removed just quickly . not only hood shade lens outside glare but its firm rubberized nature also protects lens accidental side-to-side dings accidents . there really shouldn't time when you need use lens hood speed light ( flash ) same time but if you then flash going obscured lip hood leaving darker shadow bottom image . if it weren't popup speed light i would leave lens hood permanently since it adds general bulk camera makes 5700 ( 8700 ) ' feel ' bit more substantial bit more like prosumer digital camera .	-1
product very convenient easy use . provide distance many different objects : trees , bunkers , water , flag , etc . better than lot caddies	1
gift avid golfer who really liked it can't wait use it - alask	1
i only used it few times like it , especially slope feature ( i'm not tournament player ) , but i must point out it took me while learn steady it enough get good readings . it still takes me too long get readings when flag more than 200 yds away , especially when there no wind when background cluttered . perhaps i get better results more use practice . i play friends who low handicappers ( i'm not ) who don't waste time course . while they ask me readings when slope hole great , i usually don't much time get readings keep playing steady pace . instruction manual too sketchy my liking	-1
this one most versatile compact cameras ever . 3 " display awesome . it makes it very easy frame subject also editing modifying pictures . this one , i own three digital cameras far , this most convenient easy use . prompts menu very logical easy follow . movie feature also awesome . sound quality best i've seen any camera this size . very impressed !!	1
i purchased this camera after more research than i put into buying car - well almost . it turned out very easy set up . touch screen menus work smoothly intuitively . you almost throw manual away unless you want get really technical . automatic setting covered just anything i've wanted so far . battery life seems good i especially like fact there no protruding lens get broken/jammed . i gave it only four stars because last item - durability - yet tested . so far , so good	-1
tested case home water bucket per instructions . no leaks . went dive trip first dive i put some toilet paper closed it up . went 75 feet . no leaks . second dive , removed tissue put camera ( a610 ) . performed flawlessly 17 dives . excellent case . highly recommend case also toilet paper test	1
finding low cost but durable camera case scuba diving not easy , but canon well known line cases many its digital cameras . wp-dc90 follows legacy many canon scuba cases providing buttons operate all features camera . sealing latch most unlikely accidentally opened underwater flash diffuser led shield provided . unfortunately , case some minor annoyances . camera flash useless without separate diffuser , built flash partially obstructed lens port thus , lights subjects unevenly . indispensable diffuser clips onto lens port sits infront flash , prone physical abuse . both diffuser led shield snap onto camera easily dislodged bump grind typical dive boats . both come laynards tie them camera housing , which then leads danglies than easily snag underwater . i've already ripped one such laynard partially damaged diffuser older model camera . special techniques clips devised hold diffuser shield more securely such rough conditions during high surf shore dives . many buttons mixed blessing . my previous canon flooded exceeding its depth limitation , led leaks began around lens housing ; otherwise minor leaks occur dirty case o ring . depth , control button o rings increasingly become tight , such than buttons become inoperable near case depth limit . i yet experience leak buttons themselves , but most underwater cameras allow only minimum controls reduce risk flood many moving parts .	-1
this camera works great . batteries last quite awhile too . good quality pictures . good deal price	-1
i've canon digital cameras past two years my first , opted purchase accompanying canon camera case . though it good fit , it couple flaws caused me look elsewhere case when i got my second digital camera this year . this time around , i chose tamrac case because , unlike canon , it zips closed . canon flap closure creates two big gaps either side case , allowing small particles get inside camera itself . second , tamrac features not only belt loop , like canon , but nice shoulder strap . this means user carry camera hands free without put it purse or backpack . this case fits many small film slim digital cameras ( go tamrac website download spec sheet lists camera/case compatability ) , so don't expect custom fit . my canon a510 , this case bit long side , but no so much so i concerned it shifting around too much case . it good bag great manufacturer decent price . recommended	-1
i received merchandise working condition promptly , lowest price . i use amazon again	1
arrived time . battery gave me promised time usage/recommend all digital camera user	1

i love just everything this camera . it nice small , it easy use , it takes nice photos . but , i haven't figured out yet how get good night photos , ' though , i've used " best shots " ( feature camera ) . i've it 3 months am still learning it . but , all all , i love this little camera . price right , it what you want it if you get camera sun shield , any camera store ( $19.00 ) , you'll glad you	-1
frame very easy setup usb or wireless , took all 5 minutes get wireless configuration working	1
i bought this before i went trip florida . i took it out water one day take pictures people riding waves day while snorkeling . it also good insurance device when we kayaking . only drawbacks it hard see screen under water you make sure you wash salty water off . it great investment my camera i am looking forward using it costa rica this summer	1
we got it while honeymoon hawaii , it wirth every penny . it workd well gives you freedom take your digitaal camara places you otherwise wouldn't .	1
this excellent camera daily use . it lots functionality , its easy use , it takes outstanding pictures . never you need more than 7.1 mega-pixels anything you want little camera like this .	1
i purchased this camera my wife 2 years ago , it very heavy use since . it always her purse , us many trips always performed flawlessly . battery life adaquate , camera itself small enough carried you anywhere without becoming burden , it amazingly sturdy . when i needed get camera present freind recently , i delighted this model still market - very attractively priced . i think cost / performace factor this camera best market this time ( jan . 2007 )	1
this also works d50 , mine actually came this unit instead en-el3 . it slightly higher capacity so that nice bonus , plus cheaper then en-el3 so it win-win . i took pictures all day just one battery so it last while . it good backup anyhow . if you're planning upgrade d200 , i'd suggest their new en-el3e , since also work d50/d70 ( but opposite not true so don't try force en-el3 or en-el3a into d200 ! )	1
yes this remote control only work sensor front camera . however lack cable release function 500 camera . rm-1 remote control just your best option when you trying perform micro or zoom photography .	1
i got this very handy accessory item go my digital camera . it compatable very handy taking family pictures holidays where you included picture . i know camera self timers , but who wants run breathless get frame time before camera fires . this way you take more time compose your picture it turns out great . i highly recommend this if you plan taking pictures any family gathering-or taking informal portraits home .	1
i purchassed this camera my first ever snorkling trip when i went bahama cruise . overall , i very pleased . pictures came out clear camera easy use even under water . only issue i it almost end roll film turn wheel jammed ceased work . i lost last two pictures . i'm not sure if it defect camera , or if i over zealous turning wheel my excitment event . considering quality developed pictures , i would certainly try this camera again .	-1
this little case very convenient , especially if you extra battery , which i . i it all time me my trip turkey , it got attention everyone who saw its sleek design . perfect fit goes right your belt ( or your purse my fiancee found out ) . great buy . highly recommended .	1
when you buy product designed meant fulfill certain needs , just expect best performance out those features . pc55 camera everyday home shooter , easy use made best sony quality one smallest mini dv camera ever created . if you thinking buying this camera don't hesitate one minute , this camcorder one kind , it gives you pretty much flexibility video quality regular camcorder but amazing bring-it-in-the-pocket size all coolness attention it brings ( let it your best ice breaker , believe me it works like heaven ! ) . i work camera store let me tell you : we haven't received one return this model during time i've worked there ( 8 months ) , which proves high quality sony built into this model . i using mine few months now all i say " product great ... period ! " . let get real , 500 bucks you paying it not film quality kind movie you get picture ( you need spend least couple thousand dollars ) but portability worriless no need big luggage camcorder used past " ( some times people don't realize motorcycle couldn't compared truck or vise versa ) . picture shooting option , well let see ! camcorder videos digital camera photos , if you want them both one package , brings excellent quality , you'd spend lot more money than if you bought them separately , let me explain you few words , average photo quality mini dv camcorder 1.3 mp or lower ( same quality you get out your cell phone camera ) honest you , manufacturers add this option just give it extra feature same time take more money out your pocket , tape less digital cameras it happens same way , video sound quality very poor ; so why bother paying more camera both functions excellent ( there quite few out market now , starting around $1200 models similar size ) instead buy two little cameras , one each use , half price . if you looking cool , high quality durability mini dv camcorder smallest size available its kind , sony dcr-pc55 your best option . finish , i just want wish you all enjoy , more than product , unmemorable moments you live your loved ones because this little fellow	1
if you want capture every precious moments , this right camcorder you . it easy operate video crisp clear . sound pretty good well . you also take still picture video same time ( thanks memory stick ) . don't burn your video using your computer , it took me time download cd or dvd . instead burn them you watch them . it quicker way . you love it first time you use it	1
so much praise already ... where i begin ? well this simply best camcorder i've ever owned or used . this level i've used gl2 past . but i bought vx2100 . i took some footage lake recently thought i looking film when i played it back my hdtv . color beautiful natural looking ! one rule . better lighting better picture ! my first camcorder jvc 87 ' vhs-c just same size this camcorder now . but me-o-my , what difference digital makes !! i dig ilink my camcorder my pc tv my dvd recorder . ilink run show ! many manual features lets dude take control play around when he wants too ! screen menu really simple manual this well written straight forward . but i must admit some dubbing info over my head present well using memory chip tapes . but i'll get there . 12x zoom could more but it also plenty ! stabilization works fine my needs , but alot what i shoot tripod mounted ! " put it tripod " { what movie ? } ha ha . 2 1/2 " lcd bit small , works fine , but i find myself gravitating eyepiece . it quicker use saves battery life . but lcd great turn 180 degrees shoot yourself { ha } use remote ! you might want buy sony 970 battery . don't waste or risk other brands , this one battery i used 6 hrs straight doing interview it still life it !! one come it course small battery lasts 2 1/2 hrs . thats rec . play-back , stand-by etc etc . just these two batteries all i need !!!!!! also i added wide angle lense . canon 58m wide anlge works fine this unit . some lighting too ; how smith victor 2 umbrella 250 watts lights . makes indoor shooting look like tv show ! lastly mic . depending your use , you might want shotgun mic outdoors , or lav mic indoors . camera mic people speaking rather close . all all i couldn't happier i bought " this " camcorder . i read looked around quite awhile before i bought . i think i more sony products my house than any other this now no exception ! lights , camera , action !	1
this camera one best its kind : ultra compact , great quality construction , friendly menu , excellent lens ( thanks leica ) very attractive price . it peforms according leica reputation , extremelly well . image stabilization boosts end results . however not expect results similar more expensive srls you disappointed especially cases 8x10 or even larger images noise becames factor- smaller images you should no problems you able capture your moments ease . again this one best choices compact digital camera market segmant there plenty options	1
this little thing perfect anyone who looking sleek , compact digital camera take amazing photos . i took it europe amazed shots it took - portraits , close-ups , landscapes , action , indoor , outdoor . no complaints	1
all digital camera force you make trade-offs ... it hard cruel fact personal photography . coolpix s3 , near perfect grab go camera four photographers our family . picture quality , our eyes , great ! when compared our rebel xt or d70 cameras , s3 shots loose bit information but only through comparison much more expensive equipment . this camera very easy use those new digital photography . pre-programmed scenarios easy access provide great shots . camera proven sturdy , survived couple bumps bruises without drama . we always keep it ballistic nylon case , though , protect screen . i'm convinced many problems people cite s3 ( or s1)are result unfamiliarity using camera features more-so than defect camera ( save white-spot issues which we not observed date ) . red-eye reduction semi effective but no more than any dozen newer cameras our hobby room . free online photo editors cure red-eye much better than any in-camera solutions . if you're looking digital camera always at-hand deliver great photo , s3 should your list check-out	1
this might worst product ever . what good camcorder if it virtually impossible get video onto your computer . support horrid ; software worse . stay away this one . too bad really , most my previous electronics equipment made sony , but i never buy them again	-1
some 50 years , beginning leica iiig i bought 1950 , i used variety 35mm digital still cameras . i figured it time try my hand video . i spent several days researching variety entry level video cameras finally decided dcr-hc32 . given slight difference price bare camera this package , i went package . handycam arrived couple days ago i immediately put it use filming one my grandchildren . it not long before i realized capturing images video more complicated when using still camera . i put handycam down picked up operating guide . after spending time reading guide checking out multitude options this little camera provides , i called my grandchild back more product testing . results gratifying . it not seem possible such small videotape provide such crystal clear images , but it . i experienced bit shake when zooming , even steadyshot turned , but may least part attributed these old hands . i conducted most my early video trials my den night , single overhead flourescent light providing only illumination . even without slowing shutter color beautiful . i sent my grandchild shadowy corner 20 feet camera try out super nightshot . it worked well . color thin but good . then i turned out light shot super nightshot plus . what i got incredibly grainy black white image recognizable human , but that all . i ordered infrared light use very dim dark light . filming video outdoors bright sunny day , results crystal clear color excellent . sound pickup more than couple yards handycam disappointing . i wish this camera jack accessory microphone . still picture quality certainly could better . however , i fine digital still camera take care usual still photography work still images this handycam creates may not studio quality , but ones i made certainly adequate sharing or adding family album . i not doubt there times when using handycam i would like capture some special moment still picture . this use , handycam works just fine , far i am concernedi am well pleased this little camera unhesitatingly recommend it anyone interested buying quality introductory level video camera . using sony dvm60pr3 cassettes image color clarity surprisingly good . i urge anyone not familiar small video cameras heed sony suggestion spend time operating guide while battery getting its first charge .	1
professional reviews sold me this camera , experience buying it through amazon exceeded my expectations . camera arrived ahead schedule camera performs great - even after i dropped it once	1
i've this camera 5 1/2 months it it way shop repaired 2nd time . first time they nothing it . not sure what wrong tech . i bought this good quality pictures frame . when i'm ready photograph it sits shop . would i suggest this camera serious photographer ? no i would not . my trip 30 days where my camera ? not me!i'm very disappointed . i thought kodak better products repair set up than this . buy extended warranty if you get this camera . outside pictures white . inside pictures red/blue lines across . i grandchildren way no camera take them . * sigh*i could go but you get my point this . kodak much proving me sell me again	1
i purchased this replace olympus camera pretty much junk day it new . i hesitant kodak because some their earlier cameras complicated hard use . i wanted buy camera use product pictures business use family photos , vacations such . my previous cameras used only product pictures because image quality fair best . prints made digital images not photo quality my opinion . z612 pleasant surprise . it easy use , controls fairly simple . you not need engineering degree use it . screen bright fairly easy see even bright light . quality pictures great . zoom fantastic . auto focus wonderful feature actually works very well . bad - " easyshare " software pretty much hijacks all images your computer . it installs it self so it automatically starts when you boot your computer , changes all image icons easyshare icon . it not offer many options installation or operation . it appears work ok but it more problem than problem solver advanced users . i personally use photoshop not want other generic software trying dominate image editor . camera should come memory card well internal memory . this time memory card sold seperately which adds $ 30.00 price camera . camera comes neck strap no wrist strap . wrist strap would nice addition prevent camera making it all way ground if it dropped while use . overall it great camera great value . i other digital cameras cost three times much virtually useless .	1
i'm not sure why people complaining this backpack so small since description pictures accurate ( though it looks smaller real life scale not all obvious ) . i easily fit medium sized camera 28-300 lens attached 18-55 lens directly below it . i don't other lenses fill up side partitions main compartment , but could easily fit 2 4 more lenses ( depending size ) these areas . sides main compartment seem bit tighter fit things , however . even conservative , this pack should fit camera lens attached , 2 additional lenses flash main compartment . smaller front pocket i fit 2 memory cards , compact lens cleaning kit , larger lens cloth , 8 aa batteries , compact charger . mini-tripod or compact water bottle would fit outside pocket/strap . don't expect carry huge amounts additional things this pack aside additional small items like keys , wallet , map , cell phone . you're not going putting your thermos , picnic lunch jacket here . it not even big most computer backpacks , but it certainly doesn't claim . you might fit some small additional items , but not anything bulky . construction seems good it reasonably rigid well padded . it good value price	-1
i've this camera pack while now i just can't live without it . after reading tons reviews researching other sites stores , i decided this would fit my needs best . it small , light weight carries everything inside it without drawing attention itself . i carry my canon 20d all my accessories plus few personal extras all day without back pain or tiring out . trust me , when it mardi gras big easy , means lot ! i carry following my pack :( while i able fit everything listed below inside , mind you , it tightly packed)**canon 20d 100mm lens attached ( without hood ) strap**18-55 kit lens**promaster external flash unit 2 stofen omni bounce diffusers**backup camera battery charger ** 3 4/packs aa batteries ( flash unit)**all my owner manuals plus medium sized handbook ( i'm beginner)**lens cloth small airblower bottle lens cleaning**cords hooking camera tv pc**2 backup memory cards ( red flap extremely handy keep track used cards)**small notebook pen , few personal items such chapstick , headband etc ... ** cell phone ( hooked outside)**water bottle ( hooked outside)**sunglasses ( outer pocket -meant tripod)plus : 1 . size - perfect medium sized female2 . construction - extremely well made , sturdy fabric , lots padding great job keep humidity out ( big deal down here)3 . organized - it repositionable/removable compartment dividers , packing what you need breeze ... plus there lots hooks such outside additional options ... you add tripod if you choose . 4 . color makes it look like any normal back pack . 5 . price great what i got . minus : ( very minor , but these my reasons giving 4 opposed 5 stars)1 . rain flap over zippers make opening closing somewhat combersome , but you get used it . besides it like extra layer protection ( both rain thieving hands ) . 2 . if you want fit external flash extra lenses , you may consider larger bag . 3 . it doesn't really great job carrying my tripod . it becomes too difficult get my camera out pack tripod attached ( you remove tripod before you able open bag , not most convenient while walking around ) .	-1
i use this great product when playing golf while hunting . plus it just fun great discussion item . it very accurate precise	1
i love size style this little camera bag . it only single compartment shoulder strap nice long . long enough use around waist fanny pack . bag itself isn't padded inside it rather stiff . tight fit my camera , but good protection i think . i just wanted keep my camera getting scratched up this trick nicely	-1
i purchased this bundle last week amazon , first price ($170)was amazing it arrived only two days standard shipping . i able use camera right out box , although after few pictures i need put it printer dock charge it but couple hours later it fully charged . this awesome bundle , it even comes small pack paper so you start printing pictures right away , which i printer very easy use just plug it , put camera top , press print button you great picture minute later . this my second digital camera i am so impressed it , this exactly what i looking . i wanted camera higher number megapixels , my old camera 1.3 , i wanted able take picture no delay time you press button time it actually takes picture . if you kids you defenitly don't want delay . i purchase memory card since camera only holds 11 or 12 pictures it internal memory . if you looking easy use camera good picture quality ease printing your pictures home then this perfect camera printer you .	1
i very nervous because this item not ship when expected but both times i called customer service updates they very helpful i end up getting this plenty time christmas . i would definitely buy them again	1
i am always taking pictures i am so thoroughly impressed fuji film especially 200 iso it only film i use- kodak doesnt seem deliver results i want when i tried fuji- it became my favorite right off- great colors , bold , doesnt mute them like i found kodak do- highly recommend	1
i bought this present someone who isn't technically saavy . they absolutly loved it . easy use functions great photo quality made this excellent gift .	1
charge lasts long time through most 512 digital card . i keep charged one back-up	1
modern 400 speed films better every way than slow 100 speed films when i first started shooting 35mm . because this i see no reason shoot anything slower than iso 400 these days . all color films i like fuji superia best ; colors rich saturated without looking unatural . grain sharpness very good fast film . this now my standard film . i buy bricks fuji superia x-tra onsies twosies everything else my pictures never looked better	1
while picture quality 400 speed doesn't quite compare 100 speeds , this film simply awesome . sometimes artificial colors ( punchy reds deep blues ) really bring out ' pop ' most scenes ( especially grey days ) . terms all around consumer film , this simply best what i use when i shoot my pamp ;s . what makes this film so spectacular even higher speed , you don't sacrifce picture quality color saturation , making it possible hand-hold even dim or night situations . colors great picture quality nearly indistinguishable slower speed films . simply put , only film i like more fuji reala	-1
very easy use , using it over two years now . great quality pics easy print , command , choose options quickly . also take fast photos so you not miss any moments . also like video mode shot blips when i forget or not want carry camcorder	1
if you looking dslr under 700 bucks this camera get . this camera improves * ist dl almost every way . shake reduction awesome , battery life great , pictures clear , 11-point af godsend these cameras , kit lens best compared nikon canons kit lenses-it produces sharp clear images , fact it uses aa batteries sd cards also great . my only gripes slow buffer speed when it comes continuous shooting ( 3fps then 1fps ) . once again this camera not ideal sport enthusiast who needs conitinous shots constantly but it still holds it own . i also think they could improved auto-focus tad more ( although 11-point af helps greatly lowlight low contrast situations ) . this camera easy hold long periods time especially compared canon rebel xti model ( which caused my hand cramp up within 5 minutes holding it ) . also , lenses available this camera prices/quality them unmatched . if you want get into serious photography but don't want sell first born , start this !	1
this my my first dlsr . pentax made transition clean effortless k100d . it enough auto features modes make things easy one coming ps plus all control exerienced photgrapher could want . all this it take any mount lens work manual mode any them plus it work fully auto af ones . 18-55mm kit lens big surprise , lotta quality very little cash	1
easy carry lots room your canon cp printers	1
1 . cannot live video capture streaming tripod , since firewire usb interfaces both require handycam station place ( which covers up tripod mounts ) . 2 . transferring video this windows machine terrible . works fine mac , but imovie mac inadequate capturing video use web . capturing video windows nightmare setup ... especially if you use variety computers .	-1
i excited when i received my handy cam . i pictured all niagra falls , ocean city , washington dc , new york etc etc etc .. vedio quality gr8 outdoors it just more than what i want ... indoor video not good .. when you shoot night its not visible if shot night mode every thing comes like 1930 black white , not real . i also used stills they good 1 mb shots . outdoors they you may want them too but indoor or night they useless ... so over all it giving me what i expected it too .. i safely say it met my expectation it performance . not outstanding deal but really worthy deal make .. i recomand this camera people .	-1
although i don't lot experience good binoculars , nikon action extreme impressed me its quality , image brightness , field view , image sharpness . it fairly large binocular tire your arms after extended handheld use . excellent value price	1
i purchased this product put my car deterient possible vandals . it great because it looks like real camera blinking red led light , it make vandals think they monitored . i really like this option spending tons money real camera . plus , you not worry privacy issues because it not real camera . not only , this imitation camera portable so you use it any property	1
i tried digital . i really . but i could never get really gorgeous shots i got my old yashica slr which gave up ghost several years back . i also could not really " focus " what i shooting ... just pointed shot because there no film run out . result ? pointless pics weren't even good looking . digital just didn't feel " right . " so 8 months ago i decided go back film . what get ? after much research , i finally decided canon t2 . absolutely brilliant camera . my favorite feature ? i let camera handle focus , etc . or i go completely manual . may not seem like big deal , but it feels so good control what camera when you want . course , means letting your imagination go ... something sorely lacking digital . couldn't happier no more pointless pics . okay , maybe few , but they still look good . isn't point	1
i got this after switching digital camera . digital cameras didn't offer depth i wanted not proofs big drawback . i am no means expert photography , but i know great photograph when i see one , this camera takes beautiful shots . this beautiful camera . elegant design ; grey body black accents definately attention grabber . people look your camera . it definately brains back up it beauty . loading film easy quick . it 8 or so presets . there automatic " point shoot " mode which you'll probably use most . it automatically compensates light , adjusting shutter speed aperture perfect shot . quick autofocus allows you grab your shot quickly , without waiting camera decide take picture . it also settings portrait shots , close ups , night , landscape , no flash , many others . those settings maximize camera features those particular shot . it also program setting where you program shutter speed , aperture , flash film advance . though comprehensive presets , i don't think you'll ever need use it . 28-90 lens comes kit nice , selector autofocus or manual focus . it also , course , removed so you add other lenses . zoom powerful leads beautiful shots . overall this unbelievable camera . great price , features , pictures best you've ever seen . they very crisp , clear almost 3d lifelike quality them , something i've never seen outside professionally taken photograph . this camera awesome	1
i recently started small photography business doing black white shots kids their natural environment . i wanted camera took quality shots , but still cost effective . i most definitely found it . my cannon takes great shots allows me mobility needed chase kids around . very pleased .	1
i owned canon powershot s-series ( s330 ) , a-series ( a540 , a570is ) s2 . i wanted 28mm wide angle point shoot , so i bought this because canon sd800 outrageously priced . i'm canon fanatic , so prepared multiple comparisons . however this camera worth crossing over panasonic . pros - i definitely enjoy 28mm feature . bright rear display wonderful , os quite intuitive well . also it gets great battery life . ~ 300 shot estimate specs pretty realistic . cons - compared canon cameras this my conclusion - all canon camera much truer white balance presets . even red blue fine tuning options , indoor dim lighting really hard , snow lighting . this camera takes much more saturated contrasty photos than canons . even when fx01 set less-vivid , it way more saturated than canon most vivid setting . end result dramatic unrealistic photo sometimes . ccd noise issue . this camera sensor much noisier than canons ' . nothing dramatic deal-breaking , but don't expect same crisp , clean shots canon take . finally panasonic image stabilization . it really not hold its own against canon . i used 570 handheld shots 1/4 second , sometimes longer , decent results . same goes s2 ( which i highly recommend digital camcorder/super zoom hybrid ) . panasonic sensor doesn't seem match iso standards you set it , it wants slower shutter speeds 2.8 iso 100 than canon set same f-stop iso . so , despite fx01 mega ois , its longer shutter speeds mean you still get shake you wouldn't equivalent canon . i know canon , canon , canon . well , i told you i'm biased . after reading these cons , why would you get this ? it 1/2 price sd 800 ( if you shop around ) it must city photos , big landscapes ( skies look so cool wide angle ) it vital indoor group shots ! buy it , but don't expect world it	-1
good product but color not so attracticed	1
easy get up running , unit goes into slideshow mode after power automatically . picture quality excellent . easy put pictures memory card them show up . recommend re-cropping your pictures 16x9 aspect ratio so you get full picture . unit accomodate std . 4x6 format well , but not fill screen . small quirks : - when slideshow mode , you can't hit pause button zoom . - very poorly designed stand collapse after couple weeks . - documentation lacking ( typical coby style ) - no support quicktime video popular some digital cameras - unit faint lingering glow screen after power down which doesn't go away unless you unplug unit	-1
i'm like most people digital camera . i take bazillion pictures , develop 10% onto paper , then banish other 90% computer storage archives . i mean , i'd love display lot more those pictures my computer , but who wall space or time organize all those prints ? that why i decided get digital picture frame . i looking quite some time , but always turned off small-ish lcd sizes or poor resolutions . then i came across this coby 10 " widescreen unit , 800x480 pixel display ! there no reviews amazon ( time ) , but spec-wise it what i wanted ; larger display higher resolution . i took chance ordered one am i glad i ! display huge , pictures look crisp . colors pretty accurate when compared my calibrated lcd computer monitor . interchangeable frames ( it comes black one well white one ) make it easy match your d�cor . litte remote easy use , but easy lose well , so make sure you place it somewhere easy find . built-in mp3 player nice touch . speakers aren't great ( it picture frame after all ) , but it nice frame play music while slideshow mode . there variety transition effects choose . i haven't tried playing videos it , so i can't comment feature . said , there few things prevent me giving this 5 stars . 1 . adjustable stand made cheap feeling plastic . i've seen other frames much nicer backs . yes , i know it front you looking , but stand should sturdier , my opinion . 2 . angle stand , while adjustable , simply held place friction . it actually one setting it click into , but then it angled too much view normal position . 3 . there seems software bug causes display act weird slideshow mode . well , more precise , if you slideshow mode you choose either fade , mask , or cross comb transition effects , then very top horizontal pixel line starts show black sections . it looks like dead pixels , but once you exit slideshow ( or use other effects other than then ones i listed ) everything fine . i recreated this problem , but i don't know if it just my frame or all these . no biggie . i now use no transition effects it perfect . 4 . this not really complaint product but more coby specs . their website they state lcd 800x480 . great ! so i ordered frame then resized whole bunch pictures resolution . however , when i got frame started using it , i noticed all my pictures black ( blank ) bars both left right sides picture . it turns out resolution actually 860x480 ( which i found out after some trial-and-error ) . it would nice know this ahead time save me re-resize my pictures . plus , sizing pictures 860x480 really weird ratio ... kinda like getting 4x7 prints . i ordered this total electronics ( one amazon vendors ) it arrived quickly . when i reported " dead pixel " problem ( which turned out software bug , not defect , so speak ) , they responded my email quickly offered take it back no questions asked . now that customer service ! overall , i am very pleased this product . reality , it rates 4.5 stars . i'm type person agonizes over something before finally buying it . this purchase , totally unncessary !	-1
i got this little thing 2 months ago my birthday , am quite happy it . i took it me vacation japan , able take home tons picture memories . i'll start cons : 1 ) you hold it still several seconds when taking pictures , or else they turn out blurry . this only real problem when taking spur-of-the-moment pictures , or if hurry , which not happen too often . 2 ) flash extremely bright , so close objects wash out . ( just turn off flash this not problem)3 ) digital zoom - not good optical , but not too bad . now pros : 1 ) this thing small ! it came neckstrap , so i wore it necklace during my vacation , it so light i barely noticed it . 2 ) lots memory- my 512mb card holds least 530 pictures/videos , there still room . 3 ) really easy operate , i able change flash settings , delete pictures , use self-timer , take video review pictures without even read instruction manuel . 4 ) quick easy file transfer my computer-just hook it up usb , drag drop . 5 ) extrememly bright flash , while listed con , also nice when taking pictures dark , they show up if it middle day , provided you not too close . overall , i gotta say i love this little camera . sure , picture quality isn't best , but if you decent lighting conditions , you hold still few seconds , you get some good quality pictures	-1

this wide angle lens works better than i expected . i bought this my sony hc-96 . it increases field 30% . i able sit front row children musical still fit all kids stage frame . i expected edge distortion but it not noticeable unless you carefully look it . i suspect it interferes autofocus times during zooming focus seems fluctuate little bit high zoom . it useful tight quarters when you need wide angle shot	-1

i'm not professional photographer or even serious amateur , though i take thousands photos . i bought a620 8 months ago because i wanted something small but good go my much larger new nikon d50 . both cameras replacing old 3 mp fujifilm minolta film slr . we took a620 d50 major trip canadian rockies several u.s. national parks . d50 my " default " camera trip -- frankly , i afraid " risk " shots a620 , especially since there many times when i needed wider-angle lens than a620 provides . then , one afternoon , top mountain jasper spectacular panoramic view , d50 battery ran down . i crestfallen , forced use a620 . rest afternoon , i worried fretted how one major highlights our trip wouldn't captured well a620 . well , make long story short , several weeks later i uploaded all our photos d50 a620 , ones a620 top mountain better ! i amazed -- nicer color , sharper , just plain better ! now i totally trust a620 actually use it far more than d50 because it lot easier take . i still prefer d50 indoor flash shots--there lot red-eye a620 -- but i say , if i'd bought a620 before d50 given it good test run , i don't think i would bought d50 , even though i really like it . sometimes portability much more important than you think it going . i got a620 brand new under $200 -- it great deal great camera . i think it especially good people like me who aren't likely delve into all intricacies settings , etc ., but still take lot photos want them look great . what i've read other reviews , though , both here other sites , this very nice camera more advanced photographers well . good job , canon ! next my wishlist : something similar this camera but wider-angle lens longer telephoto ... , course , less red-eye flash !	1

i nikon coolpix which small but too big shove into my pocket so i bought sony . i love it small , get used making sure my fingers not within lense view . extra battery memory sticks run up cost ( but goes any digital camera ) . it easy use since i'm not much one reading instruction books yet able figure things out fairly easily . i don't movies so can't comment but straight photos turn out really well ( which surprises me since i've always really lousy photographer ) . i like i carry it me all time , which i . i wrap whole camera small cloth envelope so lcd doesn't get scratched up . i added neck lanyard usually used computer flash key so i wear camera around my neck or wrap strap around my hands just case it slips out my fingers -- camera so lightweight . only complaint i shutter door , which slides effortlessly turn camera , slides effortlessly even when you don't want it . i've used up battery many times while camera sitting my pocket ( so i always carry extra battery me ) . extra plus loading pics onto computer breeze ( no extra software needed , just cable comes camera ) . there still slight delay depressing button take picture when camera actually takes picture but it not bad nikon . i assume newer versions this camera only gotten better . well worth money ( i just wish i could lock shutter cover )	-1

i lot research digital cameras before making purchase . probably 50 hours [ ... ] [ ... ] price checks 10 different websites asked everyone i knew what they liked didn't like their cameras . i am so happy i picked this one . it very lightweight yet durable , sleek attractive if that what you want . large viewfinder great asset . great zoom capabilities although i say picture quality ( screen , anyway ) somewhat compromised ( gets little grainy ) max zoom . i probably only use 6 or 7 " best shot " modes regular basis but it fun experiment them all . very long battery life . i took this camera 7-night cruise didn't recharge it all . i 2 friends who ready buy new cameras they going get this one	1
absolutely wonderful camera ! i lot research before buying this camera i really pleased shipment quality . it takes fantastic clear photos !	1

purchased this unit new $160 . good performance - little practice , getting readings well over 800 yards , even bright sunlight . also like fact it uses standard aaa cells . housing design leaves bit desired - it bulky , battery cover not very secure . see losing cover easily . not ergonomic more recent models . overall , $160 rangefinder genuine 800 yard performance , good deal	-1

this camera deserves 5 stars if you need camera easily fits your pocket or purse ready use whenever picture or movie moment arrives , even under water . considering varied picture taking situations , action , lighting conditions , performance beyond my expectations . only significant limitation seeing display bright sunlight or under water , even when screen set its brightest . however , aiming intuitive enough i never missed shot i able change modes even under water ( but i practice switching underwater wide 2 movie ahead time ) . one feature would improvement would ability zoom while taking movie . i received this camera just couple days before leaving cruise so i didn't any time practice it . careful not your finger front lens , especially under water where you may not watching screen . also aware when you zoom movies image movement also magnified . wide angle underwater movies much better than full optical zoom ( digital zoom off ) . after couple days controls easy use change modes review pictures movies . i used 1 gig cards highest resolution which provided 240 pictures or 40 minutes movies . switching back forth easy . movie recording continue until card full or battery runs out , not just short clips . my clips too short until i comfortable i would not quickly fill up memory card or run out battery . under water pictures superb natural shift color toward green . i recharged battery every other night . battery able take 100 pictures 15 minutes movie recharges . i recommend spare battery it indicate it getting low couple times ran out once . camera also used daylight , inside , without flash , even night shots ( auto setting better than night scene harbor lights night . camera steadied railing ) . i purchased lanyard metal clasp sports authority dollar which provides very secure leash . lanyard around my neck i could tuck camera my shirt pocket . i always ready next picture opportunity without worrying dropping it . i'm very pleased picture quality although it may not match camera much larger lens system , but it great able take pictures movies when i would not my larger camera available . 15 fps movies not match 3ccd digital video camera , but they acceptable . i even recorded short clips during live theater performances ( screen brightness set its minimum ) i pleased quality this tiny camera .	1
this one best pointshoot camera , auto focus works perfectly fine , it just requires little practice . night shot picture quality unbelievable . very sharp natural colors big zoom . i would highly recommend this camera , just spend little time learn how get steady green light(focus ) you good go	1

this my fifth digital camera , i like it best far . it also cheapest . it my first wide-angle my first silver-not-black : someone else said , i don't see how i would ever go back non-wide-angle after this ; but i wish mine black . i noticed colors faded fluorescent light , but macro it excellent -- much better than more expensive camera i already bought macro purposes ( canon . ) i also love battery , which seems last forever . i bought replacement lenmar battery which also great , cheap , but it got some bad reviews because it described wrong model camera , not fx-01 . ( if you read customer reviews , you figure out which one right one you . ) i problems understanding display , which shows options don't correspond any place camera you select options . ( i guess i should look manual . ) also , i don't like software decided not download it all . i bought this because i wanted camera made computer company much camera company , , i wanted it work . also , someone sent me email history leica , how they saved lot jews concentration camps . other nice thing this camera i use it lot more because i carry it me every day : it tiny battery always works , so why not ? graininess , my desktop pics look fine , i would not raving this camera if it not very easy take good pics -- but i admit i haven't used it printed pics so far	1
great camera , just chosen editor choice pc mag well . [ ... ] i it 3 weeks now , couple family parties later i am really happy this little one . fits even tight jeans pockets , quick take pictures . face recognition works really well , not flawless , but really amazing . i took 300 shots so far they mostly great quality , some indoor pictures without flash bit blurry , if you don't hold it steady . my 4 year old niece running around it took nice shots just her own automatic setting , pretty amazing . flash bit strong when close indoors . it takes fast pictures very easy understand . i still read manual , though . ;-) i added fast 2gb card even video quality pretty good , althought just avi format , not mpg . sound great . it even speaker when you play video review . outside pictures outstanding quality . i some outside self-timer family pictures enlarged store 20-30cm , picture quality awesome . highly recommended when you want camera you carry you all times	1
i all sorts research sd600 . i made up my mind sd600 camera me . sd1000 newer kid block therefore not many reviews . why i am here today . sd1000 newest version sd600 few additions . those few additions make this camera awesome . i love iso choices . i zooming my local calif . freeways around 80mph decided take few shots passing signs out my passenger window . high speed iso caught such great detail i could clearly read sign later home . means despite small size camera filtered out shake my hand , shake road , compensated fast movement . color options very much same other canon powershot models . macro so much fun play this camera . button layout easy figure out . lighting options like white balance button push away . face detection option you sure get great photo family . i playing it none stop over week . get least gig memory . only downside i found , it minor one , when battery warning comes it means you 1-2 more pics then it shuts off . i ordered battery ahead time it worth it . batteries charge 30-40mins . this great camera . if you thinking sd600 step up get sd1000 . you not disappointed it	1
this pretty good camera , loaded lots features . pros include 10x optical zoom , use sd card , battery consumption . also , this camera you ability buy add-ons such zoom lenses such - makes it nice those just past beginner experience . there couple cons i've found , most important picture quality . although it capability take great photos , you make sure wait several seconds shots ensure they'll come out looking great ( my opinion , anyway ) . size okay , although it kinda bulky so small . i prefer something size also slim - it not so easy carry around because this . overall , this camera very easy use	-1
this camera i use it works great ! i surprised how well it records video too ! it very easy adjust camera environment you photographings . zoom excellent doesn't seem drain batteries much . i would recommend this camera amateur or professional .	1
this only camera you ever need ! i mine 1.5 years not only pictures great but i use 2gb memory card video quality amazing !!! i take video , load unto my computer dvd family watch less than hour ( if you can't wait just plug cord hookup your tv watch video straight camera ) . i retired my digital sony handycam ( which great video camera ) . i used this camera extensively 1.5 years traveling china , europe us - no problems - friends family amazed quality pictures	1

price i paid it , this lense best zoom lense any nikon photographer shold . i picked this one ( over 70-300mm nikon lense ) it fully complimented my nikon d50 18-55 lense . i using it outside make photos my son swimming polo game i couldn't understand what other reviewers saying this lense slow stopping action . i able freeze actions game each water splashes then ball flying hitting water surface . i am hightly recommending this lense	1
lens exactly what it supposed . quality high , price competitive . i am very satisfied it	-1
this great little helper if you plan your camera around your neck long period time want some protection . it not easiest thing get into , expecially lens , so i wouldn't this my camera if i thought i would need quick shot . but if you're hiking ( taking some time setting up most your shots ) this nice alternative keep your camera protective backpack whole time . worth money , well made , but not " easy , easy out "	-1
first off , let me make it clear i am satisfied this camera . i it 8 months now i put it through its paces its held up fine . but there few things you must know : camera no zoom . i mean , practically no zoom . 2.2 may look decent but its pointless any real-life situation . you find yourself moving lot your camera get better shot , not standing one place using zoom feature . you never get close wide shot - its just not possible this camera . this camera great average stills but that it . you click twice take picture or " press halfway then fully " according manual . this major pain . sometimes when battery weak , it may take lot time take picture ( lot frustration ) , so this not cam capture any special pictures or " kodak moments " . apart these cons , camera great value money offers video all kinds stuff . if you're looking mostly looking take landscape or portrait stills , this camera good job	-1
i gave this camera 5 stars because it awesome features . this camera perfect size kids you put video this camera . i love this camera . i think it takes awesome pictures	1
just what i needed my camera . just like sony make something isnt universal	1
i bought this camera case my dscw5 , it perfect fit camera . it sturdy enough it protect but soft enough carry easily your person . great case money , i recommend it	-1
i am professional photographer . i looked around many cases decided qbp-3 myself . i use this case times i don't want drag around my full slr kit . it very nice size . case accept my panasonic dmc-lx1 digicam , 60gb video ipod w/earphones , 2 additional sd memory cards , spare battery , still little room left lens cloth my license or credit cards/cash . it made hold small/medium digicam main compartment . if you smaller digicam like lx1 , sony series , casio exlim , or pentax optio there enough room left ipod . it construction means there padding camera my ipod so neither gets scratched . there also pass-through slot top case digicams " hand-strap " . what makes this case work ipod quite well because it perfect headphone pass-through , just make sure you remote . back pocket nice webbing pockets made memory chips . it also larger size zippered interior pocket misc flat stuff . exterior there snap open belt clip over three inches tall uses elastic allow little play what fits beneath it . back front case constructed reinforced " armored " ballistic nylon quite durable so far . center area just plain heavy duty ballistic nylon , but still what i would consider very strong . this case ideal me use run around . i purchase this after looking cases lowepro , tenba , quantray , domke , tamrac . i still didn't find case fit small digicam well this one .	1
after little work camera measurements ( i lumix dmc-f27 ) i decided tamrac 5696 just could perfect bag . this turned out correct . there just enough room camera few accessories . it very easy carry treats camera quite well . i wouldn't want smaller or larger bag . it very well made easy use . i'm very pleased bag overall	1
i shopping my digital zoom camera idea digital camera zoom wouldn't collapse enough fit into bag never occurred me . but , that what happened . upon receiving my panasonic , dmc-fz20 , i surprise how light it yet how big it . those shopping bag which hold one slr w/lens this great bag ! i've purchased other tamrac digital series bags satisfaction . material quality , craftsmanship , design all excellent . this bag hold-up world travel various family outings . but , if you more than one lens , flash , or want hold battery charger ( or loads spare film ) this container too small ! tamrac makes such good product i'm replacing this digital-6 system-3 unit . only note caution : when purchasing parts bag ( any bag ) use tape measure , arrange you parts , then measure them typical configuration , use " real " dimensions shop bag ( take note inner outer dimensions some bags padded there space loss when bag arrives ) .	-1
i nikon coolpix which small but too big shove into my pocket so i bought sony . i love it small , get used making sure my fingers not within lense view . extra battery memory sticks run up cost ( but goes any digital camera ) . it easy use since i'm not much one reading instruction books yet able figure things out fairly easily . i don't movies so can't comment but straight photos turn out really well ( which surprises me since i've always really lousy photographer ) . i like i carry it me all time , which i . i wrap whole camera small cloth envelope so lcd doesn't get scratched up . i added neck lanyard usually used computer flash key so i wear camera around my neck or wrap strap around my hands just case it slips out my fingers -- camera so lightweight . only complaint i shutter door , which slides effortlessly turn camera , slides effortlessly even when you don't want it . i've used up battery many times while camera sitting my pocket ( so i always carry extra battery me ) . extra plus loading pics onto computer breeze ( no extra software needed , just cable comes camera ) . there still slight delay depressing button take picture when camera actually takes picture but it not bad nikon . i assume newer versions this camera only gotten better . well worth money ( i just wish i could lock shutter cover )	-1
no words this item , this best camera i ever bought , programs downlow pictures its fenomenal , if you oportunities go it , buyit	1
i owned canon powershot s-series ( s330 ) , a-series ( a540 , a570is ) s2 . i wanted 28mm wide angle point shoot , so i bought this because canon sd800 outrageously priced . i'm canon fanatic , so prepared multiple comparisons . however this camera worth crossing over panasonic . pros - i definitely enjoy 28mm feature . bright rear display wonderful , os quite intuitive well . also it gets great battery life . ~ 300 shot estimate specs pretty realistic . cons - compared canon cameras this my conclusion - all canon camera much truer white balance presets . even red blue fine tuning options , indoor dim lighting really hard , snow lighting . this camera takes much more saturated contrasty photos than canons . even when fx01 set less-vivid , it way more saturated than canon most vivid setting . end result dramatic unrealistic photo sometimes . ccd noise issue . this camera sensor much noisier than canons ' . nothing dramatic deal-breaking , but don't expect same crisp , clean shots canon take . finally panasonic image stabilization . it really not hold its own against canon . i used 570 handheld shots 1/4 second , sometimes longer , decent results . same goes s2 ( which i highly recommend digital camcorder/super zoom hybrid ) . panasonic sensor doesn't seem match iso standards you set it , it wants slower shutter speeds 2.8 iso 100 than canon set same f-stop iso . so , despite fx01 mega ois , its longer shutter speeds mean you still get shake you wouldn't equivalent canon . i know canon , canon , canon . well , i told you i'm biased . after reading these cons , why would you get this ? it 1/2 price sd 800 ( if you shop around ) it must city photos , big landscapes ( skies look so cool wide angle ) it vital indoor group shots ! buy it , but don't expect world it	-1
now i know you should never bye elctronic things online . i bought expensive camera , after 3 days it didn't work without any outer influence . i tried contact seller , but they didn't react all . there only email adress , nobody responded . i didn't even adress antonline . then i asked amazone adress send defective camera back , they didn't give it me . i did't get replacement or refund . i never again , nobody reachable or helped me	-1

i bought panasonic pv-gs180 2.3 mp 3ccd minidv camcorder replace earlier panasonic model i send their repair facility twice various problems , when tape transport quit working , i decided go new camera rather than send it third time . so i little concerned reliability panasonic camcorders . but i wanted jump 3ccd technology , this one lowest price camcorders offering feature . i this camera three months , it worked flawlessly me so far . it more compact than my previous camera , thus necessity controls closer together . this took bit getting used-to , but thumb-activated joystick control very easy use , enables user change camera settings quickly . zoom control more sensitive than one my previous camera , i still occasionally zoom or out faster than i intended , but i just remember less ham-fingered . i pleasantly surprised quality resolution still images captured using photoshoot function . before i owned this camera , i constantly juggling my still video cameras when recording activities my grandchildren , but now i often just use video camera both still video shots . i don't notice great deal difference video quality my earlier 1 ccd camcorder this 3 ccd one , because colors resolution very good both . my videos seem exhibit less jerkiness this one than previous one , however , due eis ( electronic image stabilization ) function ( which turned off if you find it makes images bit blurry - i don't ) , also fact it smaller thus easier hold steady . all all , excellent product , which i hope continue work well	1
truly dream come true . even received phone call tell me when they would delivering it since it higher dollar item . very professional	1
hello , i bought my sony hdr-fx1 month ago amazon.com let me just say this camera amazing . resolution , when computer 1920x1080 . right there enough sell camera ! its great me because i work cg cmi , higher resolution , more accurate you . this also great blue/greenscreening high resolution , amazing color . there several different modes shoot ( all customizable ) you mostly want make sure you shoot cinemaframe30 or cinemaframe24 because it look just like film . you also adjust how much color allowed , standard it " 0 " but you up color so much its more vibrant then most movies . new willy wonka movie broad , powerful colors this camera easily achieve . i would talk more this camera but im out time ( great dof ) . so dont get stuck canon xl2 fad where you pay 3,000 more dollars crappier camera	1
i am student filmmaker i just bought this camera sonystyle.com . its great consumer camcorder . it not offer true hd picture quality but it offer true hd resolution . if you want hd camera rivals film cameras expect spend 50 100 thousand dollars . best thing camera its resolution true 16:9 aspect ratio . if you hate 16:9 squeeze mode other camcorders this camcorder you . some people disappointed camcorder lacking progressive scan mode , 720p . its debated if 720p true hd . hdr-fx1 shoots 1080i which true hd resolution . if 1080i shot progressive scan it would go outside bandwidth limit . so if you plan transfer it film one should get software de-interlacing capabilities . over all minor flaws piss off professionals , but they realize moment true hd only 1080i not 1080p . lack xlr inputs also hurt camcorder but there ways around . one big worry amount compression occurs while shoot hdv minidv tape . what i experience compression not major factor worry yet until i more testing . over all this superior camcorder compared regular dv camcorders . 24p not only thing give film look . aspect ratio detail very important well . resolution detail far superior any other consumer camcorder . if detail resolution top your list , than this camcorder you , once editing software comes out it	-1
tons features , love touch screen ! easy use " easy mode " superior picture quality . typical sony stuff , ya gotta love it	1
this one best bargains i've seen , " essentially " you get 3 filters price one . image quality these filters great , 812 ( warming ) filter far favorite giving back color richness flash photography so often washes out , unless you patience constantly tweaking your flash power . aside 812 uv protector basically clear protective filter . while it obviously advantages over clear glass , i tend not think it any different . this too great filter which i use half time because it doesn't affect color hues or change stop values too greatly while it takes worry out carrying camera around ready any candid shots may occur . finally included circular polarizer . this filter adjusts amount uv light entering camera spinning filter direction uv rays entering ( or turning thingy till things look better ) . this lens great sunny days take surface glare off lakes glass making them transparent again . it also makes colors more crisp general when photographing buildings other large " reflective " man-made things . so things sound great so far , but now why i only give this item 4 stars . while tiffen known one best photo video filters , they quality control issues no live up thier reputation . my case 812 filter arrived discoloration glass . while it didn't hurt image quality , flaw towards edge filter , i none less didn't want find situation which flaw would diminish quality . seeing it not amazon fault my first e-mail went tiffen replacement which they said they would gladly , but only after i send them filter they recieve it would they ship my replacement ( not option my circumstances ) . instead amazon wonderful customer service shown through again , within 3 days they replaced entire set . second set arrivided without flaw but since my other two filters perfect condition i traded just 812 . i havn't any other issues i'm very satisfied my filters . only other word warning would circular polorizer . while i recieved 2 flawless occassionally i read reviews customers received ones assembled backwards making lens useless . quick way check see if your cp working correctly hold it , thread facing yourself , look lcd monitor or tv spin it until picture dissapears(obviously working correctly ) . i still wouldn't pass up this deal knowing what i now , chances everything show up perfectly but none less if you're concerned order it before you need it check everything over carefully . amazon always best returns often ship replacement next day overnight shipping . little further insight ... i recently doing some black white film photography , decided use my 812 warming filter protective lens i carrying 3 lenses me . just thought i would mention using this filter produce " white " sky some outdoor photographs . shots taken gradient blue sky which entirety showed up white , even bracketed sets , should shown something one series . while itself interesting effect some shots , it mostly just caused me frustration darkroom . i just wanted add this fair warning . i discovered this accident , so i don't know if it applies all sky conditions i didn't lot bw sky shots , i might test it using photoshop later i see they 812s effect built . anyways , good luck fun photoing	1
i'm fifteen years old , photography major hobby mine already . i using my father way-out-of-date 2.1 megapixel camera 2 years , wanted upgrade better camera . when i searching , this not my list cameras buy . i looking ones such much more slim sony cyber shot dsc-w5 . i made sure give my mom list all ones i wanted , since christmas approaching fast . when i opened my gifts found z700 , i wasn't sure what think , i admit i may bit ungrateful . package , it appeared clumsy hold , because since i'm left-handed i tend take pictures up-side-down so i hold camera my left hand . design this prohibited me doing , because grip side bit awkward manufactured right hands . it also appeared really bulky against other cameras i've seen , because grip plus how far lense zooms out makes it big camera compared others . it also runs normal batteries , but it cannot use alkaline . they last all 5 shots . you buy either special batteries kodak , or lithium batteries , both which extremely expensive . my first few uses , it hard getting used large design , lcd screen smaller than i expected well . after month or two , i started getting used it . once i got past size , i realized it takes very crisp pictures . digital zoom useless because it adds pixelation , but normal zoom very good itself . lcd pretty much washes out bright light , but viewfinder very helpful . same happens low light . it lot settings found useful , such night portrait , night landscape , text documents , self-portrait . sports setting also useful . it hard focus closeup stuff auto mode , but self-portrait option takes care any closeup stuff . it also heavy camera , which makes it feel lot more sturdy than some lightweight aluminum cameras now . dial little hard turn , buttons little hard press , but everything really easy figure out , you'll taking great pictures no time	-1
winning combo ! 4mp digital camera takes vivid pictures allow clear enlargements up 11 " 14 " . 5x optical zoom lets you get little closer look than most 3x optical zoom digital cameras . neatest feature this camera built-in lens cap automatically shields lens when camera turned off . kodak digital cameras #1 ease use reason - they point-and-shoot simple everyday users , but extra settings tweak if you want more specific control . this camera take compressed video clips depending size your memory card . you want purchase larger sd memory card than what included package . included cords , you hook camera up tv view pictures you taken or it display live view . this indispensible if you babysitting . kids love see themselves tv ! printer dock series 3 lets you dock camera recharge batteries , print pictures , one-touch transfer pictures computer touch-up or emailing . you don't need computer print pictures . it print 4 6 " or smaller multiples picture . photo paper cartridge refills available online or most large retailers . they aren't cheap , but it lets you your own photo lab home . hard beat amazon price . camera + printer dock = pictures , prints , battery charger , computer interface .	1
this great , fun camera . just load film shoot . it easy use easy sneak up your subject because theirs no focusing fooling it . you use camera one hand , including turning wheel next frame . worth low price	1
this lens good way extend capabilities general purpose camera amature photographer . overall all quality color accuracy digital images good . large lens diameter blocks view finder , forcing one rely lcd screen framing . camera sometimes gets confused during action shots taking longer than normal auto focus - minor inconvenience . lens requires adapter - seperate piece keep track .	-1
i never thought i would brag point shoot camera , but canon g6 remarkable . , add-on lens equally suprising . granted , this not interchangeable slr lens , but it great use all subjects one would shoot this camera . i am glad i chose canon brand lens . note : i use lensmate adapter .	-1
i looking something exactly like this ever since i bought my digital camera . i used several kinds boxes , including cassette tape case . i am presently using my cell phone leather case would like put it back where it belongs . i like this so much i may buy some my brother father use thier cameras . thanks million keep up good work ....	1
i bought this camera almost year ago before i went trip italy ... i kind worried it because i never slr before , but i really wanted one , i wanted make sure i didn't cheap looking pictures my trip which i often before . it worked perfectly ! i only got chance use one roll film it before i went , but all pictures came out great ! i just love this camera , i still use it all time . i am learning all features , like how use bulb setting . i used it 4th july fireworks , they also came out wonderfully . i would highly recommend this camera	1

my first professional digital slr nikon d1x . i got great pictures it but it too large heavy lug around extended periods . i also some issues its operation . but now , nikon seems solved my issues d200 . i purchased dedicated sb-800 flash 18-200 lens recommended d200 manual . whole system much improved over my other digital slr . both focus metering seem work more reliably . it works better available light . optical anti-vibration aids overall picture sharpness ( plus those us who not rock-steady ) . i am getting use button sequence required enlarge picture preview really like amount magnification possible . menuing system seems quite extensive well-organized . i would like more latitude picture quality settings ( e.g. contract , saturation , sharpness ) . help screens really tell me something when i'm confused . i appreciate " modeling " feature . it useful when attempting compose dark situation . it also lets me see reflections before they committed picture . unfortunately this feature not work using built-in flash . i wish nikon could add some type lock continuous-single-manual focus selector front camera . my finger seems move switch unknowingly . i would appreciate battery charger built plug rather than detachable cord . person who still wears thick glasses , i wish nikon could make viewfinder more like one their old n8008 . or maybe it time away pentaprisoms mechanical mirrors give us truly pro camera mimics high-end pro-sumer models electronic viewfinders adjustable view screens	-1
i'm glad i purchased this accessory kit my new canon s80 -- extra long lanyard allows one carry camera easily accessible way while hiking . second battery invaluable . case leather fits snuggly -- it useful protecting camera when it carried purse or backpack , but i am finding i set it aside when i'm move taking pix	-1

this amazing deal works great it not take long batteries charg	1
please note since there already many user reviews written , this may not seem like much " review " , but i thought i would touch few things i wondering myself before buying camera case it might help someone else . this hard drive-based camcorder wonderful . well jvc ! i going buy next model up , mg70 , but since i don't use it photos , i don't believe i would benefit increased megapixel ccd . besides , mg70 only 10x optical zoom , missing video light 1.2 bright lens . i'm happy mg50 . case you haven't noticed , this camcorder no viewfinder so you must use flip-out lcd screen . video quality : hard drive feature brilliant ! only quality level you should avoid econo ( 37 hr mode ) , since it reduces resolution half also records only 15 frames per second . ultra-fine ( 7.25 hrs ) best , but i couldn't notice much difference when i lowered quality level fine ( 10 hrs ) or normal ( 14 hrs ) . highest 3 modes ( ultra fine , fine , normal ) , camera records full 720x480 resolution . far i tell , it really sampling many lines resolution . other digital camcorders i've used ( mini-dv ) very noticable " stair-step jaggies " parts picture , especially borders high-contrast elements picture . this hard drive camera , however , resolution significantly higher these jagged lines ( aliasing ) rarely noticeable all , if ever . how camera records files onto hard drive : it creates new . mod file ( it mpeg-2 video file dolby digital audio ) every time you start/stop recording . so , all your clips conveniently seperated , but course you combine them your video editing software later if you prefer . camera record 12 hrs continuously if needed , but create new . mod file every 4gb footage . you may read other reviews following trick : rename . mod files camera records . mpg increased compatibility . well , i tried it it works like charm , regardless whether your video footage 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio . this makes it easy use your favorite dvd-burning or video editing software this camera , well ensuring future compatibility . i haven't found even one program couldn't play files perfectly after i renamed them . even windows media player 9 no problem . if you leave them . mod , then you won't find many programs support it ( least not yet ) . only ones i found one came camera ( cyberlink ) , adobe premiere elements 2 . one thing i should mention files camera saves . it numbers them hexadecimal ( 1-9 then a-f ( eg . mov009 , then mov00a ... )) , so some people may find this bit annoying . also , my windows xp computer alphabetizes files a-z , then 0-9 , so they end up displayed wrong order . i'm not sure why my computer doing this don't know if all windows xp computers it ( it worked fine my windows 2000 computer ) , but you always list them chronological order if you need correct this . i believe most video editing software , however , list files correct alphanumeric order ( 1-9 then a-z ) . mine all . camera handy feature called " file# reset " . every time you activate this , it creates new folder hard drive begins saving all future clips into it . this handy way seperate your recorded " events " , case you tend fill up hard drive before copying it your computer , you may months worth footage camera . so you your daughter birthday party one folder , your trip zoo , etc ... playback : playback sequential clips camera ( either lcd or onto tv ) seamless . there no pause scenes - it plays back just like tape would clean cuts recordings . also , you locate specific clips viewing thumbnail images ( 9 per screen ) or listing recording date . then , course , after playing back clips , there no need fast forward tape back next available blank part recording . when you go record again , camera not overwrite previous material . camera allows limited editing ( deleting or rearranging clips ) . also , case you delete lot clips then continue recording , hard drive may eventually become fragmented . camera handy utility built defragment hard drive . i haven't used it myself because i haven't needed it , but it nice know it there . low light performance this camera isn't best i've seen , but it still pretty good such small camera . my previous camera jvc well ( mini dv - only 3 years old ) . it slightly brighter low light , however , i find this hard drive jvc camera much better autofocus performance low light or fast movements . all recent jvc cameras ( including this mg50 ) " night alive " mode which reduces shutter speed 1/2 second . this useless unless your camera tripod your subject not moving all . you might well take picture then ... however , mg50 adjustable shutter speeds well . i find it useful low light situations change shutter speed 1/15 sec . this brightens image considerably . it reduce motion blur if things moving too fast , but i still consider it reasonable trade-off amount extra brightness scene . built-in light useful under some situations . aware effective range light only 3-5 feet , so unless your subject within range , light won't make any difference . it it useful moments though ( like filming pet floor dimly lit room ) also , using light consumes less than 10% more power because it led , but course that also reason why it not very bright . photos : image quality still photos , my opinion , terrible . not only resolution inadequate most uses , it extremely difficult depress shutter button without shaking camera blurring image . start/stop button ( doubles shutter release button photo mode ) quite stiff . startup time : this camera poor startup time , but i guess that expected it hard drive camera . completely off position , it takes 10 full seconds ( based my own tests ) before you actually begin recording . even this only double typical startup time mini-dv camera , it might mean you'll miss special moment you're trying record . even if camera record-standby mode , it still takes 3 seconds time you press start/stop button until camera actually recording . camera noise : camera produce faint hum while hard drive spinning , but i found this less noticeable recording than sound tape machanism 3 mini-dv camcorders i've used . course , some mechanical noise expected compact cameras like this one . without external mic , it unavoidable . unfortunately this camera , you cannot connect external mic . zooming motor also slightly noticeable , but no more than other similar-sized camcorders . besides , unkless you're completely quiet situation these sounds won't even issue all you . lens cap : lens cap stays place nicely . since it only covers lens itself doesn't extend any further than it needs , it tends stay place ( unlike other cameras i've where lens cap pops off while inserting/removing it bag or pocket ) . drop detection : you may read this camera feature senses freefall or other motion could potentially damage hard drive , automatically shuts camera off . well , just so you know , there option camera turn this feature off , case you want make video your favorite rollercoaster . i'm not saying i recommend this , but i just thought i'd mention it . i myself not personally witnessed this feature work yet , but then again i haven't tried dropping it ! overall , i highly recommend this camcorder casual videographer ( great vacations ! ) . it seems really stand up competing cameras it class most points . however , if you're more serious videographer you might want consider larger , 3-ccd camera bright light external mic . otherwise , fun ! i gave this review only 4 stars because these few issues : lack viewfinder , slow startup time , poor image quality still photos	-1

if you serious your videography , then you need able charge your batteries using something other than supplied " through camera " method . i suppose if you purchase enough extra batteries you might not need this , but i still don't like plugging my camera just keep battery charged . even high end hd sony , there not separate way charge batteries , limits you if you lots video . this one best most complete charging solutions i seen . i highly recommend it	1
