we bought our machine 2 weeks ago . it looks wonderful , nice sturdy , alot different features , but we haven't able use it . it didn't work day we brought it home fighting ironman customer service department ever since . they keep giving us runaround saying different technicians coming but nobody ever shows up . evertime we call their 1800 number we're hold least 30 minutes before we even get talk person then they just lie say they either call us back or someone out day . well after 2 weeks , we've it ! we're taking it back never buying ironman product again . they're nice machines good warrentys but what good it if they won't get anyone out there fix it ? nothing against store , they've great . just 2 big thumbs down manufacturer	-1
i purchased this bike rack because i moving out state didn't enough room back my car bike . i also needed rack transport my bike local trails , parks , etc . so , i went schwinn given brand name it relatively inexpensive . i drove nc fla , approx 700 miles , bad idea this rack . i didn't any trouble assembling rack , only took 5 minutes ready go . however , during my trip , i pull over side interstate no less than 5 times tighten straps back . buckles not hold straps place . this real problem if you travelling highway ( or any busy road ) you worry your bike flying off back into oncoming traffic . also , even if buckles hold , wind drag bike starts pull brackets right off rack frame . i purchase 4 bungee cords rope order secure my bike flying off back ( yes , rack assembled correctly ) . bottom line , this rack probably great value if don't plan driving more than few miles or over 40-50mph , otherwise , it complete waste .	-1

let me first say i not purchase this mini stepper through amazon , but rather directly discovery channel store . two weeks after i submitted my review their product their web site , however , they still not seen fit post it . i used discovery electronic mini stepper daily 29 days ( 30 minutes per day ) before cable around pulley-wheel broke . this seems consistent problem this piece equipment , judging previous reviews dcs ( discover channel store ) web site . inside 30 day return window , i sent my stepper back refund . customer service , i must say , excellent ... only product itself cheap substandard . related note , this third mini stepper ( various brands , not all dcs ) i owned past year . they all broken down one way or . feel free look some my previous reviews here get details , but bottom line this my last mini stepper . take some advice me when i say these machines built people who beginners world fitness . say , if you intend use mini stepper two or three days per week 15-20 minutes , then you may satisfied one . however , if you advanced or even intermediate stage your workout routine , then don't even consider one these machines - you destroy it , trust me . there just too much go wrong -- pulleys cracking , pulley cables breaking , shocks leaking ... i actually broke frame one stepper . through all this , i learned one important lesson exercise : keep it simple . i am now great success some simple resistance bands ( many varieties available here amazon ) cardiovascular exercises ( e.g. regular old jumping-jacks ) . i get better workout than any i ever got mini stepper , i'm feeling great even lost little weight right places :-) honestly , if you want save yourself some grief , please learn my experiences avoid horrible cycle mini stepper destruction . just buy yourself some resistance bands , maybe jump rope , exercise mat , instructional video/book , then get work . exercising tone your body lose weight isn't easy ( if it , then you're probably not doing it right ) , but you make it easier not wasting your time money junk like this	-1
brunton nexus star low-cost , fairly rugged , basic compass . like any low-cost compass , if you know how use it you get where you want go , but it lacks features you may later wish you . plus side , it lightweight , inexpensive , fairly thin , so it doesn't take up lot room your pocket . minus side , baseplate very short , so it harder use map little less accurate when reading bearing . biggest disadvantage , my opinion , it doesn't true declination adjustment ; it advertised " declination scale " which not same . baseplate compass , you take bearing lining up compass needle inside north reference indicator ( sometimes called " doghouse " ) etched bottom vial . compasses true declination adjustment allow you rotate this " doghouse " align it desired declination . way you always read bearing aligning needle inside doghouse . nexus star , however , you can't this . instead , you remember line up compass needle point scale corresponds local declination . this case , needle not boxed inside doghouse , i find it lead errors , especially when you tired not thinking clearly after long hike . if you always navigate using magnetic bearings rather than true bearings , this isn't problem . i recommend this compass use gps receiver set read magnetic bearings , it suitable back-up compass . i also regularly use it inexpensive tool teach students my gps classes how use compass , but i wouldn't recommend it serious work	-1
this ball radio controlled remote size small cell phone . ball two small holes ( smaller than size dimple ) opposite sides connect battery operated charger ( 2 aa ) . remote uses 9v battery . ball small internal battery apparently replaced if needed once it longer hold charge . ball operated couple minutes after charge . ball not meant hit , but probably withstand putter hit short distance . because rolling weight circuitry within otherwise hollow ball , ball not roll straight its own . ball looks somewhat like real ball but slightly off-white color obvious seam . when using remote control ball , ball revs up 2-3 seconds making rattling sound , then it takes off still rattling away . arrow ball present let you know initial direction ball roll . you reverse ball direction , but you can't make it go left or righ t.t he two biggest drawbacks this gag ball : 1 . you only direct ball two directions ( front - back ) remote . 2 . fairly loud rattling noise made ball probably heard 20 yards away . gag ball , it seems like it only limited use . but $10 , what more i expect	-1

" he nearly killed me , coming fast me , broadside . he regained nearly 15 or more mph he started his right turn , still accelerating , when he spotted me panic-braked . we one point 2 feet apart , thanks his hard braking , my veering left ( luckily deserted ) dark main road . i , fraction second , looking down his headlights bumper almost below me . could reached over touched his hood ornament . incredible experience . it my closest call ever , scared hell out me . it must've scared hell out him , too . he registered his shock-and-awe reproaching after-fact horn blast , he scrambled around passed me , racing off before i could read his plate . i guess it must've ticked him off , my scaring him close call . one little vehicular manslaughter change your address awhile . equally maddening him , after he passed intruding cyclist red blinkie taillight , white helmet , all reflectors ( those alerted him , once i his front-and-center target ) , he would then see blazing headlight pencil-beam his rear-view mirror . damn , nuttin ' he could blame this creep bike . :-[ el-300 simply failed me time , i see it , focusing most its light narrow , long-projecting beam . it focused left where he looking , when i very close side street he traveling , ignoring his stop-sign . there should , so much light energy , some part diverted wider , closer bike , even if lower intensity . my judgement there two related design flaws this lamp : 1 . narrow focused beam , making you " live (??) " single direction which you aim beam . its relatively dim peripheral light gets lost any ambient light . 2 . turn aggravated its wandering aiming you settle , both vertically horizontally . vertical part worse ; mounting clamp sets too far back headlight balance-point , so it seesaw that forward-heavy . lift your bike front , tap it down lightly , you've likely refocused lamp lower , you would not if mounting balance-point . aim it temporarily right ( tight ) , you seemingly good go ... but only far first noticeable bump . it then drops few degrees , you keep correcting it vertically , light either your intended path , or oncoming drivers ' windshields . your need like oscars : you want both see , seen , only this case save your life . i am chasing after led lamp now , which i understand wider ( brighter ) beam . i respect cateye general . their current website page battery-op headlamps not offer el-300 .	-1
i purchased this product performance bike replace much older ( 10yr ) cateye wired computer . i certain amount brand loyalty cateye because their products typically higher quality ( almost always manufactured japan opposed china ) typically last long time , like aforementioned 10-year-old cycle-computer . i purchased this product without much hesitation , but disappointed unusually stripped feature set . cateye vectra missing two critical functions : ride timing , average speed : features even my 10-year-old velo2 computer . it offers only current speed , max , odometer , clock , trip distance . overall quality unit good , i'm sure it last years solid japanese construction , but i'll seek unit because missing features make it unusable my purposes . luckily , sender unit magnetic pickup reverse cross compatible cateye other wireless computers , i.e. it works my older cateye cordless 2 computer also . bottom line : pick cateye model watch feature set carefully	-1
i'm charge weekly touch football game where we use official nfl football previous year i wanted get one backup . i know ' duke ' supposed official nfl ball this year , but there seems something wrong balls amazon shipping . first ball i got amazon hard rock , slick all get out poor stitching laces . i got second one stitching bit better , but it still hard slippery . when it exposed rain , ball stained hands everyone who touched it red coloring . i no clue if that expected or not since it all leather but it seems odd . any case , you grip ball good pair sticky football gloves , which also help mitigate pain catching ball . so , it usable throws nice spiral but maybe i play ball bunch wussies cuz no one else wants get near thing out fear breaking their hands ( which kind annoying given how much i paid balls ) . maybe footballs just need broken , but i'm not really sure how aside playing them , which no one seems want . i've tried let some air out make things more user-friendly , but it doesn't really help . anyway , i find it really hard believe this ball nfl played this year . something them just seems cheaply made . any case , i suggest you save some money go decent composite leather ball .	-1

my son hit . 515 8 year old last year . this year , he moved up division struggled around . 250 , even though he fairly nice swing . using this device two weeks , he suddenly can't hit anything . i pitched him hardballs today he swung over top every one first 60 ! problem this device ball doesn't drop like pitched ball , so it actually trains them swing higher than normal . i'll putting this away season trying recover my son swing confidence . don't get me wrong , kids love it . entire team lines up before every game begs you throw fastballs it . it great use around house - just tie it tree you take swings you couldn't otherwise . beware if you intend use this much more than casual practice don't let it replace live pitching . fun-factor 5 , but far training device , i question its value	-1

i would not recommend this product unless you absolutely cannot afford spend any more money . around $60 , you could get " world industries m.a.d. balance board " get much better looking more durable product . or you could spend around $80 get bongo board . if you really want best money it , you could spend $120 get indo board . zoomboard i received green blue . unfortunately , it looks garish , but child may like look this . addition garish coloring scheme , board rough sandy underside . this good because it allows board better grip rolling tube . however , after couple weeks using it ( five days each week 30 minute sessions my 140 lbs . frame ) , tube develops craters sand wears down . then again , if you wait it out , sand eventually slough off board itself you won't worry wearing down your rolling tube . but gripping surface compromised . if you try using this hard floor not carpeting , rolling tube starts move less fluidly than before . make sure there no grains , pebbles , or hard materials surface you practicing because they easily ruin your rolling tube . this may failing boards use wood rolling tube . overall , this board fun , but not great quality . if you absolutely cannot afford $10 more purchase much better product , then buy this board use it sparingly carpet get long life out it . if you afford more , keep looking check out products i mentioned above get something that'll actually worth your hard-earned money	-1
i purchased this backpack ( black ) august i haven't actually used it until december ' 06 . i carrying around 40+ pounds this pack hiking apalacian trail , first day , this pack ripped . my left shoulder strap ripped off bottom , i secure it square knot . next day right shoulder strap ripped different place , i loop adjustable strap around seam belt . also , i stepped waist belt numerous times without thinking it , flimsy peice plastic broke . it still held , but i check it twice every time . i tried pick up handle above straps my fourth day hiking , left side it ripped partially . thing happened i trying put heavy items bottom bag while hiking , when i came home , i noticed bottom bag some holes it when i leaned against rock or ground catch my breath . bottom this bag nothing but fabric . this pack nothing but glorified backpack , not meant hold anything more than 25-30 pounds most . if you want backpack dependable , buy something else . if you want something cheap day hike or something , i suppose this pack you , but i'd still say this pack not worth it .	-1

i would given this product one star , but i get several months use out it before it literally melted down into useless steaming pile plastic . after two weeks use , electronic mini-stepper started creaking groaning like it could snap any moment . previous reviewers noted , thing actually starts smelling burning oil/plastic/metal . after two months use , shocks both pedals started leaking fluid . good thing i nice thick plastic mat underneath it . i owned used electronic mini-stepper all four months , using it five days per week ( 20-25 minutes per day ) , before cable secured around pully-wheel snapped loose its moorings . this probably occured because extra strain put cable due decreased pressure defective , leaking shocks . i now own twenty pound , forty dollar door stop . there no reason , other than ultra-cheap construction , 160 pound man should able destroy piece exercise equipment like this four months . during this time , i used nothing but normal exercise practices : smooth , even , steady steps ... nothing jarring . buyer beware this one	-1
i bought one brookstone mini-exercise bikes when it still priced $99.00 ( february 1 , 2007 ) , based two positive reviews posted time . initially , i impressed prompt delivery product but immediately discovered bike not factory assembled correctly . instead left- right-hand crank arm , my exercise bike two right hand crank arms . this may seem trivial until you realize cranks suppose threaded opposite directions prevent pedals coming unscrewed during use . i contacted brookstone customer service request replacement part ( i needed two right-hand pedals ) evening i received shipment . i place follow-up calls each week six weeks until finally receiving replacement pedal . when , one point , i mentioned simply returning exercise bike , customer service rep. indicated approval would needed higher up food chain because -- i waited new part--i'd bike my possession past 30-day return policy ! new pedal finally place , i immediately tried out bike disappointed ( though , unfortunately , not surprised ) overall construction feels very flimsy under foot . mini-bike quite noisy so far , i've found no floor surface keeps it reliably stable during use -- either rug or linoleum . result , i back it up against desk , file cabinet , or bookcase use . this product huge disappointment i would strongly encourage people interested purchasing small exercise bike please not waste their money -- even reduced price -- this product .	-1

this my third heart rate monitor . i purchased this one because battery died my last hr watch . i thought i could replace battery , but when i tried replace it , i broke it . oh well . . . anyway , i purchased reebok fitness hr watch because it sale ( 50% off retail ) . i couldn't find any reviews it so i " rolled dice . " my two previous hr watches , it pretty intuitive how set operate them without reading instructions . reebok hr watch , i read instructions couple times . after couple training sessions , i began feel comfortable how operate it use its settings . there few pros reebok hr watch : ( 1 ) chest heart rate strap work precor cardio machines heart rate monitors . ( 2 ) chest heart rate strap battery easily replaced . ( i don't know watch . ) ( 3 ) it lot features you'll find higher priced hr watches . now , cons : ( 1 ) heart rate reading much too small if you're near-sighted or need reading glasses . ( 2 ) shape crystal cover causes glare under certain indoor outdoor lighting so it difficult read small heart rate reading . conclusion , because heart rate reading too small there glare , i can't read watch unless i slow down , steady my arm , position my arm certain angle deflect glare . because this , i'm disappointed this watch . if you've got good eyesight , you add 1-star	-1

during time i considering buying this model , i happen see same thing local department store ; so i bought it . i couldn't wait take it back . i wasn't impressed cheap plastic . pump came adapter pre set schrader valve ; my tires presta . blister pack says it used both indicates all one take off " round end " , remove reverse plastic adapter , re insert then screw cap [ tight per label ] . seemed simple enough , so , i took off cap , took out plastic insert [ i noticed it 2 parts ] , reversed re inserted then replaced cap . when i put end presta valve then pressed down " thumb part " , i couldn't help but notice plastic would not grab valve , but loose . so i decided change back schrader type [ use my adapter valve ]; maybe this would tighter fit . so , i took off cap , tried remove insert , but only one part it came out ; parts separated ; i could not remove " bottom " half . i not going force it out . i put parts back together , re inserted them into blister pack returned it . no thanks !!! i gave this product 1 star only because way this review process set up ; it doesn't deserve any star or any consideration purchase	-1

yes , you'll feel your muscles contracting . if they really contracting degree worthy called exercise , contractions would scare heck out you : you'd either feel like your whole core paralyzed or you'd going into spastic , involuntary crunch . don't worry , won't happen . machine isn't strong enough .

maybe s120 work you , but it nothing but trouble me . i bought it because great features price , but returned it because all problems : 1 ) manual anything but friendly , e.g. after completing 11 steps set date you then told there short cut . thanks . 2 ) after spending much more than hour manual just get basic settings , i'm off exercise . great start , reading my usual pulse around 55 , then it drops out 0 . ok , maybe contacts too dry , so i wet them . off i go again pulse rate measures 204 then 0 . ok , maybe chest strap positioned poorly . different position , same result -- measured pulse rates all over map . i decide forget what monitor records finish my exercise . final result -- i got periods reasonable heart rates , but lots time values either 0 or over 190 . next day i try again same result -- drop outs then sky high readings . it went back later day	-1
living florida i bought two these everlight flashlights . party said there enough charge during shippins little shaking head . it takes least couple minutes shaking before there even glimmer light . after if you don't continue shake it dies out very rapidly . this light may possibly come handy during hurricane power failure but there other led flashlights batteries superior this one . power used these leds low batteries last long time .	-1

now i am firm believer breakfast very important time your day . yesterday morning i driving dentist office when i realized i forgotten eat . i started quite anxiety attack , so i pulled over only available place . gas station . nothing really caught my eye something i would like put inside my body . now this no ordinary gas station . this special kind one where they hot food behind counter , including supreme-pizza , chicken drum-sticks , even breakfast-style food , like little sausage-egg-buiscuit-combo-sandwich . sure , food smelled alright , but thought sickened me one mechanics or gas-pumpers may oil , grease , or even gasoline their hands when preparing these dishes . while i peering over counter , trying scope out just how filthy their hands , something my left caught my eye . it golden box something called " powerbar " . name me sold immediately ( food creates power ) , they even individually sealed prevent repulsive hands workers contaminating them . " i'm going eat powerbar " only thought my mind i purchased 4 them spot . i hopped back my vw cabrio sped off down livernois towards dentist office . i unwrapped one powerbars . it looked just like normal candy-bar but name told different story . just how much endurance stamina would one these provide , how long ? what kind advantages would i gain ? i thought i found my new favorite food . finally , food defines howard tuttleman person . , until i took my first bite . my first bite literally took me 2 minutes chew up enough able work it down my throat . it tough rubbery nugget inside chocolate stretched out bit like taffy . every bite same grimy bitter flavor , atrocious after-taste . my mouth felt like i ingested whole bottle elmer glue , every crevice my teeth gummed up it . i reluctantly continued eat entire bar . my stomach began feel if i eaten lead . i felt no extra power my body . if anything , powerbar significantly weakened me making me feel ill . i convinced i simply picked bad powerbar , so i unwrapped one give it second chance . this time i dentist parking lot . if i went now , i could make appointment time , but i try more power . big mistake . second powerbar no different . it felt like powerbars fighting my stomach . i finished second powerbar , feeling even worse . my third powerbar however worst bunch . it different flavor , i nearly threw-up . i felt 20 pounds heavier . my teeth lips felt like i eating drywall , covered chocolate grimy nugget . i simply could not eat more than 2 bites fourth one , no matter how much i tried . it time go inside . my dentist little ticked-off i late , got really annoyed all powerbar remains stuck my teeth . apparently i wasn't supposed eat while before my appointment . i felt sick rest day . i gave my dog ( morris ) rest 4th powerbar see if it would work dog , but it just made his butt really powerful night real pain clean up after . please beware , name this product deceptive , unless it supposed mean powerbar itself powerful , overpower you . later . howardtuttleman.co	-1

we know strollers !! this our 5th stroller over 4 kids . we decided try dually . pros : plenty room 2 children both 25 pounds . " cute " cons:we're reviewing what we consider expensive stroller . our opinion added expense shouldn't equal just extra seat , but better design higher quality . 1 ) while dimensions listed description , relative size every day objects not discussed . objects , like say , doors . this stroller won't fit through 90% doors world . you basically better only expect it go through front door your house or plan parking it garage next your suburban . doorway must 3'0 door ( 36 inches wide ) . that usually only your front door . forget pushing into or out any interior doorways which generally much smaller . 2 ) straps awful . again , our 4th stroller . worse one all . incredibly , incredibly difficult use . i'm actually flabergasted how difficult straps . despite tightened them up tight possible , two year old out under 10 minutes ( once she decided out ) . 3 ) impossible allow children sit up . again , adjusting straps utmost , angle backrest remains extremly steep . perhaps counter balance lack effective straps ? 4 ) hand brake setup left hand . appears reversible if you want work it . 5 ) hood not lowered cover front children . if say , you walking into sun ( morn or evening ) , kids completely exposed . conclusion : very frustrating buy . wouldn't recommend it all	-1

i used try strengthen my fingers using gripp balls , later , gravity gripp , which grip balls also 1 pound weights . however , they bulky , hard get grip , heavy pretty silly looking . so , when i saw picture these awesome little gizmos catalog , i ordered one right away . they same price grip balls , but they so much cooler ! not only this good fitness training , they're even better musicians ! ( my instrument piano . ) these light flat they fit right into purse . i don't feel silly using this out public -- if anyone asks , i just let them try it , they immediately hooked . i carried my blue one around everywhere until this weekend , when i gave it away friend . it difficult know which tension use . i'm woman small hands , found i am right blue red . i use blue one 4th 5th finger ( left hand ) . i usually handle red one everything else , but booklet says repititions more effective than heavier tension . i use mainly blue one now . i hope work up red , but while . i'm also going buy couple more so i work both hands simultaneously . i one caveat -- make sure you use these correctly . don't overdo it , or try use heavier tension just feel all macho . like any weight training , you press buttons precisely isolate muscles . don't use your whole arm just get button pressed . i found if i started cheat , i got little wrist pain felt beginnings tendonitis . ( reason i'm staying blue tension now . ) oh , buy your gripmaster here amazon . they $15 each everywhere else	1

this flashlight simply awesome if you just little common sense . this meant emergency flashlight if you use it such , it great . this definately not spotlight type light it isn't meant . but when you need some light emergency , little shaking you some light . it starting dim ? just shake it some more voila , more light . you could lost miles anywhere you know your batteries not going go dead walk help . i don't know why people giving this bad reviews . this so easy my 6 year old niece shake it get it working . if you smart enough shake it like instructions say , light last longer then people here saying . if my 6 year old niece figure it out , i would think adults could too . but , there always going people out there who complain everything . this emergency , no battery shake flashlight . i think some people expecting flashlight would shake itself . you should keep one these flashlights your vehicles , campers , boats , kids rooms , etc . how many times you went get flashlight batteries dead you couldn't find new ones ? this one worked everytime i uesd it . but then again , i common sense . this flashlight great !	1

one weigh advantages disadvantages this product based one needs or requirements . imo , pros cons ... pros : these tabs weigh only few ounces , but treat up 20 liters . they very effective killing off viruses , bacteria , giardia , cryptosporidium(epa accepted ) . this product great if you can't build fire or boil water . cons : one tab one liter so unless you stock up , you only support one person 5 days if you use 1 gal . or 4 liters per day roughly $10 . compare this 96oz( ~ 56000 drops ) clorox $4 it only takes 16 drops treat 1gal . water . katadyn claims their tabs leave virtually no taste water , but i disagree . there very strange taste water less tolerable than chlorine imo . minimum treatment time 30 minutes both . alternative : boil water 5 minutes any desired quantity virtually no cost ! :	1

typical aegs shoot 280-310 most fields moderated 350 fps limit so 400 fps aegs great if u wanna play yourself or non official place ..... i also sure hope sniper shoot 500 they normally single shot ..... theyre not same categlory so your not comparing apples apples .... this very nice gun .... it expensive parts included functionality ... this gun defidently not beginner gun so i only reccomend it people who owned 2 or more aegs previously ( aeg-tm ics , ca , aim m4 , gp , gg , ect ...	1
i'm my 5th cap now i think . silicone great lasts forever . unlike rubber ( which snag hair ) latex ( which some people allergic ) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair , glossy finish so it looks great doesn't lose elasticity . i some advice if you want try this product i've learned overt years : 1 . always rinse hang dry . i've left wet caps my gym bag after month two neglect , it develops black spots . i don't know if it mold , it doesn't wash off ... you'll buy new cap if you don't like spotted look . 2 . pull it gently . i've ripped one when i trying stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it . it not cloth so you careful . this goes latex rubber , too . 3 . wet your hair first . if your hair dry when you put it , you trap air under cap . since it not permeable material , cap start come off while you swim because air trying escape inside . 4 . pick fun color . that it . great swim	1

if you aren't prepared use swing setter couple times week ca . 5-10 minutes each time , you probably won't get benefit it offer . cd literature very good job helping you define your training regimen which you need add only discipline execute it regular basis . effects it me follows : ) despite my impression my grip solid , it forced me assume stronger , more compact grip helped me my tendency fade ball ; ) it helped me revert more hitter than swinger ( which i used when i playing better ) forcing me increase speed my swing ( especially backswing ) delay release thus stopping my tendency " cast " . quality construction excellent ; i can't imagine wearing it out although , i see magnets lose strength over time . my main problem looping swing - inside outside . so far , swing setter not seem address this problem ; i still loop magnets release desired time . i would think some other " hinged " swing trainers would better help this problem . i recommend swing setter if no other reason if you discipline , it serve conditioning device use during off-season . good luck	1

it actually called tent organizer it works fantastic . just hang it any tent pole fill it up whatever you don't want ground - toilet kit , socks , towels , etc . what great idea	1
previous reviewer provided lot good information this dvd . i thought i would add few additional comments . first , you get lot bang your buck these $50 cathe dvds - they definately worth money . this dvd 3 full workouts - boot camp , muscle endurance combo ( 2 ) . there also number other options dvd menu . i workout regularly variety videos/dvds but i'm not motivated when it comes doing resitance training my own . there some light barbell work sevaral firm cross training videos but my barbells mostly collecting dust . i found cathe dvds when searching amazon . when i saw description this dvd it sounded like perfect fit equipment i but price really challenging . i decided take chance go it . needless say , i very impressed i even ordered $50 cathe dvd . if you equipment ( barbells , dumb-bells , high step/firm step maybe even medicine ball ) you enjoy hour resistance training , i would highly recommend this dvd . it challenging experienced exerciser but it easily modified fit any other experience level . there some intense ab work this dvd too . if you don't one , you might want purchase " heavy resistance theraband exercise band " $7.49 through amazon when you order this dvd . cathe uses this also standard resistance tubing/bands aren't good subsitute . although there no price difference amazon cathe website , when ordering through amazon , cathe dvds/videos shipped priority mail . cathe website usps not option so they won't ship po box . if you live outside continental us their only shipping options 1 or 2 day air so amazon significant savings shipping if you live hawaii .	1

this kit also includes speed bag !! item description never mentions . which awesome , but i already ordered one because i thought this didn't it . however it small speed bag so keep mind . bag gloves very " budget " just like they state . so i doubt they last long . heavy bag fully packed , so box 70lbs . other than this exceptionally good value esp . free shipping	1

i've spent years camping bag clothes half-strewn around my tent , so new tent led me check this out see if i stay organized . closet comes its own thin carrying case . it looks complicated first opening , but it easy insert fiberglass rods , zip down corners , adjust velcro seams , boom ! you've got very sturdy roomy set shelves socks , shorts , t-shirts , towels , medication . there zip-down mesh cover keep things out your stuff yet keep it ventilated , it rolls up out way . pockets sides pop/beer cans , wallet , like very handy , hooks keys both sides let you keep things where you find them easily . there even pocket back stores magazines maps . but value keeping things organized , off tent floor , where you see stuff without paw through duffelbag toss things all over your tent . i'm happy found this neat piece tent furniture	1

hobbyist woodworker who works primarily hand tools , i've learn how put razor edge things like plane blades chisels . while i've managed master skill ( shave hair off my arm these tools ) , putting sharp edge my kitchen knives nightmare . i've tried numerous methods , none which worked well . year ago , i puchased spyderco sharpening kit . read manual , watched dvd , put my kitchen knives it , ...... ended up pretty dull knives . frustrated , i put this kit kitchen drawer . fast-forward last week . kitchen knives dull again , none my sharpening systems work knives . so , i pulled out spyderco again gave it try . this time , i tried sharpening my serrated bread knife . after just few strokes , it good new . so , i tried it straight knives again , but only got modest increase sharpness . now convinced some my kitchen knives made inferior stainless steel , i tried sharpening my swiss army knife . again , after few stokes sharpmaker , i wicked sharp knife . i down workshop today , sharping my plane blades chisels . last plane blade sharpen scrub plane ... blade these very convex , so sharping it always challenge . fortunately , it not need super sharp , never . sharpmaker sitting out , so i said " what heck " , gave scrub plane blade few freehand strokes sharpmaker ... no sharpening jig hold blade like i normally use . fun , i tried shave hair off my arms .... it worked ! i couldn't believe it ... this sharpmaker makes sharpening too easy!it american-made , very well thought-out , works amazingly well when your blades aren't made junk steel . what more could you ask ?	1
this review nike t-90 club team ( 32 panels)i bought this ball less than $15 thinking i couldn't go wrong . i hadn't used nike balls before , so i didn't know what expect . it turns out this ball flies better , softer , rounder , better stitched than my more expensive adidas balls . great practice ball , pick-up game ball . i would no problem using it small club match either . far my $30 adidas balls ? not chance . 5 stars based performance vs . price . i hope you get good deal i ( through eastbay athletics )	1
we just got this bag today our son . we got short version this bag , but i don't see version amazon anymore . outside very nice rip-stop nylon material soft cuddly , zipper very smooth . inside little scratchy , but i am sure it better after washing . drawstring around hood pulls nice tight keep out air . only thing i disappointed color . picture amazon , box it came , turquiose . bag definitely not turquiose ! it darker blue - closer navy - color . yellow more mustard color , not bright yellow , inside dark gray . but my son likes it anyhow , course it doesn't affect quality bag . i like fact hood turns inside out , too	1
i overall very happy performance this tent price aournd $100 . it recently survived well while used over week backpacking denali national park alaska . weight slightly more than typical backpacking tents , but price features make up . it survived over 40 mph sustained winds one night no damage . two doors size decent 6 foot people without too cozy . vestibules very handy storing your boots . colder nights it get fair amount condensation inside tent though . overall good purchase .	1
we use these socks snowmobiling -20f temperatures they keep your toes getting numb when you're outdoors long stretch . note amt head batteries very small , but it enough keep your toes numbing out trails . don't get " hot " , they not made keep your feet warm inside . amount heat they produce not enought notice heated home or office . battery life high 10 hours - maybe 12 hours low setting .	1
three things consider yoga block : size , material , color . this thing purple = ugly . material foam , this block still around 1 million years after i die - more environmentally sound purchase try cork , double price , course . finally , i like size this block , most blocks 3x5x9 , this one 4x6x9 which means its more stable	1

i used this unit twice more impressed each time . first time loaner my favorite golf shop second unit i just purchased . my reaction ... wow . great tool golfers all skill levels . information presented appears extremely accurate much more accurate than guessing or finding marker then interpolating distances . i found intelligreen feature extremely useful . i able shoot several greens unseen whereas before i would laid up safe visible landing zone short green . target lists consistent features i concerned most holes . if anything , i found target list contain too many itemsi found registration set up bit tedious would like sky golf make it easier . sure read installation instructions manual very closely . your internet browser must set allow cookies sky golf . otherwise you may spend all day never get set up or able download courses . variety plans course downloads adequate , but i wish they would include least 1 year subscription basic " par " sky player course download plan purchase unit . others complained quality construction . i don't know what their standards , but my unit seems well constructed very high quality material . bottom line , if you afford it you're looking great product improve you knowledge golf courses you play ... then this product you .	1
i've doing yoga 7 years . i've gone through couple regular sticky mats now ( i don't like how they get stretchy after couple years ) , so i decided buy something more durable . i love texture this mat -- it very solid feeling good bit stick -- it doesn't move around all . it just right amount cushion it , i use it hard floor . i also bought lumi towel ( large size ) , also manduka , put mat , since my hands feet tend sweat time i get middle my routine , this make any mat slippery . i didn't any trouble coating mat -- it wore off after little bit , i used towel until it . i also didn't agree some other reviews saying it too heavy . it bit heavy , but not too much carry around all over -- i made carry handle yoga strap ( looped over both ends rolled up mat ) throw it over my shoulder	1
these mats easy use , pretty durable , but i find them too slippery . not enough friction . thin rubber surface would much better	1
these gloves extremely high quality . they great job protecting your hands , most exercises , they help your grip . best wrist support any glove i've used date . however , mentioned : if you small hands , added padding/rubber gloves decrease circumference your grip general . this problem exercises like deadlifts , chin ups , etc . also , material inside bit like felt . when your hands sweaty , these gloves basically adhere your hand inside it usually takes me 1-2 minutes get them off . they may just need broken more , but i've used them 3 weeks thus far .	1

gym very easy assemble , took me 45 minutes my own . book supplies several different workouts , hitting every major muscle group , you get good resistance every workout . you won't get great range motion all workouts , there may times when you'll need lean back or put yourself different position order get full stretch , but those minor adjustments you'd probably make any other type equipment . gym itself light , easy move around house , doesn't take up much space . it may too light , not sturdy enough some instances , you need stand frame stand-up workouts . price outstanding , 180 dollars . you're not going find better deal than this , workout very comparable far more expensive bowflex	1

i just received blackburn delphi 6.0 earlier this week , i've already put it through few rides . i'm upgrading cateye astrale 8 i've long time . i've started training heart rate monitor more seriously lately , i thought single integrated unit handle both features would great . i almost bought delphi 5.0 while ago , but decided hold out 6.0 get nifty altimeter features . here my impressions my new computer , good bad ... pros : - mounting bracket system very clever , seems better cateye bracket i used . changeble soft platic shims line bracket clamp , changing fit different handlebar diameters . 3 different thicknesses included , which chould accomodate everything skinny aerobar computer mounts oversized road handlebars . - altimeter function great . altitude measurement solid seems very accurate . percent grade reading acts sensibly , even though it lags little ( this explained manual ) . distance climbed end ride agrees very well topographic software , works far better than gps-based solution i using . - lap feature great capturing statistical snapshots particular segments your ride . big hill your route , want know how much you climbed how fast you averaged up grade ? delphi makes it really easy see those sections taken out whole . up 20 laps recorded . i think them less " laps " more " intervals " . - backlight feature very cool . i've always just without computer info night before ... but this way , i don't . i'm sure it kills batteries , but it nice . cons : - average speed algorithm seems little flaky . it seems read ay least 0.1 mph slower than one would get simply dividing distance ride time . my cateye always agreed well calculated value , but way delphi figuring average must different . this liveable , seems less problem routes without lot stopping . - max heart rate reading get ruined frequent " spikes " , so real max hr unknown . finishing ride , it possible max hr show something unrealistic like 235 , probably due signal glitch or some interference . then , you no way knowing what true value . these spikes don't affect average , however . i should mention i've seen this behavior both standalone hrms i've before ... so it not unique delphi . - cadendce sensor hard mount so magnet close enough sensor . i put magnet very close end crank , because crank arm close enough chainstay point . but mounted there , magnet covers back side pedal spindle . if you pedals which require hexkey back side remove , could problem . they could remedied making cadence magnet little thicker . comparison , my cateye crank magnet mounted middle arm no problem . - wire cadence-enabled bracket cadence sensor very long . this may good putting it out aerobars or something , i admit too long better than too short . but i foot or more extra cable try hide around my shifter cable housings , it hard tuck slack away . i large bike frame plenty tube real estate spare . - unlike my standalone hrms , delphi doesn't calculate calories used . not those numbers ever accurate anyway , but it would nice ride-to-ride comparison . general thoughtsoverall , i think it great computer . negatives above all really minor issues , i haven't found computer yet offers much such reasonable price . there lot more tell than i include review like this . i'm just trying hit big highlights ( lowlights ) . but definitely , no regrets this end buying it .	1

our very busy toddler ( 17 months old ) good time this scooter . it very well made especially reasonable price . wheels not scratch our wood floors , unlike some her other toys . she our third we our fair share similar toys . this one one better ones . only down side it could little lower ground . she above average height just reach floor well enough push her feet . our older girls petitie this would too big them recommended age 18 months . once they their twos , our girls preferred trikes , so i'm also not sure how long this last ' favorite ' , but it definately ' handed -down ' or given friends it going last years	1

i bought older model petzl e32 myolite 3 headlamp couple years ago trip grand canyon . although it works well when move , whether hiking night , or finding your way water cooler or latrine , it two drawbacks when using it fixed location : - : even when using 3-leds ( which less-bright option ) , it so bright one not easily use it reading , nor one use it ones tent without disturbing your tent-buddy . - : even when using 3-leds it so bright it difficult use it read , since it makes white page reflect back you . also , weight bit heavy one head . it these reasons i just went out bought black diamond zenix iq my upcoming trip yosemite . i playing it my apartment tonight ( lights turned off ) , i already tell this black diamond model far superior petzl i bought 2 years ago . zenix iq following features : - it much lighter more comfortable than petzel- it 6 brightness settings ( opposed petzel 2 ): it 3 settings two leds , it 3 settings ultra-bright bulb . - it multi-function colored led acts both headlamp finder middle night ( when you wake up looking your headlamp ) , battery meter warn you ahead time when your batteries starting get low	1

plastic side mounts ( 4 ) appear solid not flimsy . i replaced 12 supplied screws actual stainless steel ones , ( you know , since this going boat ! ) but least hooks attach cooler stainless . package says " includes all stainless mounting fasteners " so i guess means hooks only . supplied screws not even galvanized . so if you plan affix these mounts permanently boat , go get stainless screws also 1/2 " longer than ones provided . all all it nice kit but little pricey what you get	1

this may ' outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it big , it ugly , but functions make fattest swiss army knife sit corner sobbing jealousy . overall , i like it but there couple things sound better than they . timepiece : outstanding . it hh : mm :ss dd: mmm , course , year setting avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying modern digital watch . stopwatch lap function ( not i ever use lap function , but i'm sure someone interested ) . countdown timer run up 24 hour countdown ( very easy set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos alarms , this one loudest watch alarms i've heard , i've missed too many watch alarms not appreciate this . altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind neat . over four days , my bedroom went 100m above sea level 25 below sea level ( maps , 40m asl ) . not surprising because it driven barometer , i never recalibrated it , but graphic demonstration importance calibrating it when you want/need it . barometer : yup , it barometer . part i like little display shows rising/falling trend , especially this always active ( even normal ' time ' mode ) . thermometer : take watch off get accurate reading sensor too close wrist . compass : easily best ' special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough orienteering , not surveying ) , easy use . it programmed declination , but knowing me , i'd forget reset it , so i declination hard way . sighting notches small but servicable . spirit level bubble unique among digital watch compasses suunto , greatly enhances accuracy confidence compass . outstanding wrist compass . package : big . really , really big . but controls very easy use seem fairly resistant accidental button pressing ( problem me other watches ) . battery shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but hatch , so you don't need take it jeweller get it replaced without ruining water resistance . display large characters high contrast back ground , display light just right , readible , even , glare free , but not emergency flashlight . personally , i'm going swap resin band velcro strap , but stock strap isn't bad , just not great . overall , not watch office or suit but very good watch , compass barometer , what you could expect thermometer altimeter . well designed , thought-out , manufactured , but really big .	1

i thought dvd excellent standpoint person not much experience lifting or exercising . it shows great technique form . i used wrestler highly competitive state iowa so over years i learned many these pushup workout techniques . pushups dumbbells used my main source lifting staying shape . i found myself too advanced power 10 workout so video seemed like common knowledge . so beginners more advanced people looking great dvd focusing developing proper form technique this excellent dvd . dvd takes you through many different styles pushups showing proper form setup . it then set three style pushup show you routine live workout motion . dvd purchase i hoping find exercise program , approximately 30-45 minutes long , sets up nice workout routine people short time . i hoping video combines variety different pushups using perfect pushup into nice timed workout . workout works my chest , back , arms , abs , some cardio into nice overall workout short time . something similar tae bo style video or other timed exercise videos . power 10 workout isn't type video . it more specifically technique video one evntually combined into workout their own . i recently wrote some emails body rev president suggesting development video more advanced people provides fast , effective workout routine one could get gym , but home 30-45 minutes their perfect pushup . he seemed pretty impressed idea so hopefully bodyrev builds this dvd like they their other products .	1

led headlights getting better all time . this little guy one watt luxeon led very good power regulation . regulation means light gets most set batteries keeps light given brightness instead dimming batteries weaken . princeton tec eos three brightness settings flash mode . i actually find flash mode too slow useful bike it flashes full power but these minor nits . i'd also prefer if light used aa instead aaa cells . so i guess there two things i don't like this light . but positives far outweigh negatives . light small supposed waterproof one meter . ( i don't ride under water so i haven't tested feature ! ) it easy operate batteries easy change . light pattern seems just right my riding . i use this light my helmet but it also comes handlebar mount . i run light lowest power setting most time that fine reading my bike computer or cue sheets . middle setting better general riding , spotting road signs potholes things like . highest setting , you get brightest beam but course eats through batteries quicker . i'm pretty sure circuit this light designed willie hunt , real guru bike lighting circles . yes , i'm enough nerd i actually keep track things like . anyhow , princeton tec eos my latest favorite bike toy	1

after reading previous reviews noticed bad comments instructions , i took into considerations purchased it anyways . nobody really talkin bad board . most us urgency putting it together w/out reading instructions simply just looking drawings . you approach this one differently . i went ahead borrowed friend mine paid him cold beverages because i defintely agree you need least 2 people put this together . instructions although not detailed mention you must read entire instructions carefully assemble this item , failure so delay your assembly because you disassemble re-assemble again . finally , it took us 4 1/2 hrs complete assembly based my experience , it wasn't bad all . i only wish they added spare washers/nuts just case you lose it . once its installed , i added water it let me tell you . its supposed portable but w/ base filled , its pretty heavy . board better rebound than other cheap boards out there but its not like ones indoor gym . 50 " adequate home use , but you better apace this . base takes alot room . ability move height up/down advertised . i it one hand . very nice !!! i measured it rim floor its accurate based height you adjusted o.o ne thing i found out just now . this " slam-it " rim , you not allowed hang it or it cause you your warranty . i know because lifetime answered my question i emailed ou t.t hey not weight limits these rims so not attempt hang it . i defenitely recommend this if your shopping one .	1
i really like this mat hugger mugger . thickness really nice especially if practicing hardwood or tile floor . i actually purchased mine tj maxx $10 buck less than selling price here . color selection very nice too . my one complaint i wash it several times rid mat chemical odor . i recommend using organic soap or spray whenever washing yoga mat . this one my experience , needs washed completely dried several times it fresh scent . all all i say this fine product . however , very best mat imho ecomats which made jute plant . much more expensive than this one but well worth price	1
i'm 26 i'm blast this board ! it much more accessible than snowboarding surfing , because you just grab your board go ! i take mine local tennis court smooth surface . they recommend using small hills stuff , but honestly stopping or slowing down pretty much impossible decent incline , so i prefer stay flat land . its amazing how long you stay board without even setting foot ground ! board seems constructed fairly well . i've gotten point where i some pretty advanced turns shifting my weight effectively , its really fun trying master it . i'm curious if ripstik ( competitor board ) better constructed since its made razor , they might put more money into design . anyways , i've mine 2 months , wheels definately showing lot wear . i'll most likely replace them soon . i'm kinda happy you use any rollerblade wheels instead some proprietary wheels . enables you look good deals some wheels . i'd also look around best deals these boards . i got mine sports authority sale $80 , after seen one fao my visit las vegas $130 . so , if you're fun-loving adult who likes cool new ways moving , i'd definately recommend this ! it addicting	1

i've never fan propane stoves . they always seemed flimsy , made those toy-sized backpacking pots pans potentially dangerous - until now . after two weeks rv-ing , fold ' go become welcome addition our set up . it very sturdy seems extremely well made . wide separation two burners heavy-duty pot supports allow two large , heavy fry pans and/or stock pots one time . few stoves any kind handle simultaneous large pots . it seems very stable when set table . because it folds half becomes its own carry-case , even though it handles such large tasks , it easy carry takes up very little storage space . it also instant start feature - you just turn nob then press button that it . you're ready cook . after you're , clean up snap . unlike other stoves where you take them all apart try get nasty , spattered grease , this one pretty much all sealed - just take pot supports off , wipe off underneath , flip pot supports over store inside then fold ' go!it great get cooking moved outside rv - especially things like frying bacon or cooking anything gives off lot steam . because our meals seem entail usually one or other , we plan getting extension hose off our main propane tank run this frequently future .	1

i bought this somewhat whim because i've wanting get little more shape ( got little bit pudge going ) i realized hardest part motivating myself work out actually getting ready going out gym .. time somewhat factor well . so i ordered this few days ago because i read some reviews here it looked like price right . set it up earlier today ; quality parts basically no worse or better than i'd expected .. think it stripped down eliptical machine . setting it up fairly easy but some instructions bit unclear . threw some running sneakers got , i've got say , feel/motion this thing really strange first . unless you ballet dancer or gymnist really good balance , prepared look like idiot this thing little while because , like it name , it completely freestyle . it range motion rhythm all up you . you ever ski lift mountain urge swing your skis forward back unison just because it gives you tiny feeling thrown off balance ? you might start unintentionally doing few minutes this thing ( it actually kind fun but course , there not much workout factor doing it ) . after 10 minutes , i started get motion down . it pretty fun once i got hang it , but i agree other reviews , it make your feet sore ... might try putting some foam footplates	1

i bought this my son ( recommended his special ed teacher ) whole family using it ever since . it nice , sturdy , trampoline it not too expensive . " folding " part little disappointing which i why it not getting full stars . however , we haven't needed use feature so it wasn't important us . overall this good quality trampoline those who looking something less expensive	1

standard 5 ' bar . not sure how accurate weight . it feels more than 13 pounds , but could just me . not big deal either way	1
it works advertised . not lot say bike rack . i hardly any wobble mine , i suspect those didn't assemble theirs correctly or aren't tightening hitch pin bolt down far enough . my only complaint weight -- it uses really heavy steel tube vertical portion rack , which i don't quite understand . vertical tube lowest load , highest load hitch draw tube . but it not big deal . it just increases weight rear car needlessly	1
this item garners same complaint i aqua sphere pull buoy : it floats , functional , but nicks/gouges very easily . i try keep this away sharper objects my swim gear bag ( snorkel , fins ) , but it still gets dented , nicked , scratched , gouged . regardless , it works quite well i really like smooth underside , ribbed handholds , ample crescent base ( perfect kicking my head down into water ) . one best parts it isn't small kid kickboard , but it not huge , either . really good product overall	1

this flashlight simply awesome if you just little common sense . this meant emergency flashlight if you use it such , it great . this definately not spotlight type light it isn't meant . but when you need some light emergency , little shaking you some light . it starting dim ? just shake it some more voila , more light . you could lost miles anywhere you know your batteries not going go dead walk help . i don't know why people giving this bad reviews . this so easy my 6 year old niece shake it get it working . if you smart enough shake it like instructions say , light last longer then people here saying . if my 6 year old niece figure it out , i would think adults could too . but , there always going people out there who complain everything . this emergency , no battery shake flashlight . i think some people expecting flashlight would shake itself . you should keep one these flashlights your vehicles , campers , boats , kids rooms , etc . how many times you went get flashlight batteries dead you couldn't find new ones ? this one worked everytime i uesd it . but then again , i common sense . this flashlight great !	1

i recently purchased pair gripmaster hand finger exercisers order help build forearm strength . i unsure which tension would appropriate , i bought one each light/blue ( 5 lbs . tension ) medium/red ( 7 lbs . tension ) grips . i've them little more than week now , i just love , love , love them ! perhaps that little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up exercise accessories , but i really enjoy grips . i leave one out my desk all times , get little work here there when i stop read document or whatnot . gripmaster exercisers different conventional grips you either work your entire hand once , or each finger individually ( great guitar players , i've heard ! ) . one side features four small levers , each its own spring , squeezed together or one time . plastic flip side molded together so you work your whole hand one unit . black rubber cushion removable , you place it either side grip . it awesome idea , allows maximum versatility ! just reference , i'm female , relatively good shape , but painfully little forearm strength ( my biceps huge years tae bo , though ! ) . 7 lb . medium/red grip do-able , but challenging . 5 lb . light/blue grip , other hand , makes much easier workout ; i oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things , i only feel it after number reps . if you're female not great shape , you'll want start out light/blue grips ( or even extra light/yellow ones ) , work your way up . out-of-shape guys probably get away medium/red ones start . if you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength , don't even both lighter tensions - skip ahead medium/red or heavy/black . although i've only owned my gripmasters week or two , can't personally vouch their durability , they seem sturdy well-crafted . my fianc brother , amateur boxer guitar player , used his years without problem , so i faith i'll squeezing these babies well into 2015 ! - kelly garbato , couch potato turned fitness fanati	1

i didn't find any fabrication problems seen other reviewers . rack seems well built sturdy , i don't see any real issues it . my only complaints would assembly instructions , which pretty vague require inordinate amount interpretation , fact hardware dimensions product don't really facilitate setting it up they've illustrated . specifically , bikes shown photos must very small , order both mounted bottom length rack . using mounting holes top section ( required if you've got two adult bikes ) require staggering brackets , opposed setting them straight horizontal line . it just bit confusing , given cost things i'm mounting it , i don't want any confusion	1

pros : - fits any bike , no crossbar adapter needed frames- folds up nicely storage- easy load/unload . 30 seconds hook rack into hitch , 30 seconds load bike rack . - can't beat price- optional extension ( sold separately ) allows carrying-up 4 bikes- light . i carry rack one hand . - low price . similar thule yakima racks nearly 3 times price . cons : - rack not extend out far enough ( least my hyundai tucson suv ) . when mounted , my bike handle bars pedals come within 2 inches my back door . i'm worried pedal could scratch my vehicle paint . i usually put sock over pedal just safe . - hooks hard adjust because release levers small tend stick . squeezing lever painful your finger . - rack several inches sway . perhaps hitch stabilizer would fix this . - i found assembly little difficult . luckily you only this once .	1

this really very good bat ... it very good control ... i tried couple others but this one best all	1
this very great racquet . i always tennis-elbow problem . not this one . not sure whether it anything advertised nano technology but frame better feedback control than most popular racquets i tried . more power even slow or medium stroke . look also great . highly recommended	1
i'm not huge outdoorsman but wanted nice everyday pocket knife . kershaw leek fits bill . i love size , long enough get your whole hand envolved task yet small enough clipped your pocket forget its there . i planning taking clip off just letting knife " float " my pocket but fell love clip . only thing better than light weight your pocket no weight your pocket . i find knife well designed i really like speed safe opening action . it solid " click " lets you know knife locked position . super sharp perfect drop point blade .	1
this great little sword . it very sharp led light bright . i keep this sword next my pillow case emergency or bad dreams . good product low price . how they sell it 5 bucks , c'mon led light probably half price already . lol	1
i love this mat . because it thickness , it really helps give me support i need enjoy yoga poses say pose without feeling if i'm hard floor ! it would nice if it available more colors other than red	1
this mat great -- it got nice padding very long . because it long , it would work great tall people and/or larger men . folds up well stores well -- wonderful	1
i expecting roll astro turf , but this turned out shorter , thick felt kind surface . mat three holes one end " sand trap " " water hazard " hole actually pictures printed inside flap box mat comes , you pop them out wedge them into foam . not sure what i expecting 16.99 , but i guess , aside looking little cheap , this work	1
very good product , especially price ( amazon lowest online price i could find ) . product delivers all advertised functionality , hip color scheme comfortable shoulder straps . zippers bit difficult when particularly when backpack cinched	1
i skeptical first but upon reading empyreal review i went ahead bought it . it provides surprisingly comfortable surface great nights sleep . i agree empyreal now dont see need buying actual bed matress quite some time . oh , maybe it just me but i didnt realize this item required batteries . inflator requires 4 batteries	1
living my own first time , i not my own bed . i decided use air mattress temporary solution while i saved up money shopped normal beds . year later , i still used this swiss air bed every night . there seemed no point buying normal bed when this one so comfortable durable . it didn't lose air , meaning i only fill it up air maybe once or twice month ( yes , month ) . it comfortable . it durable , lining this thing extremely thick . it spend several months propped against metal heater sharp edges , thing never got hole . unfortunately , after 13 months nightly use , it developed small hole one seams top mattress . i couldn't find one store , settle coleman ... which absolutely nothing like my swiss . coleman very thin lining , making me paranoid what i set next it . it loses air requires refilling everyday . it comfortable , but because it loses so much air it not firm . so now i really get real bed	1
this particular knife almost all tools one use , only missing scissors . much thinner than plastic scaled versions , alox versions very strong but not quite smooth opening due lack stainless liners . blade steel proprietary stainless holds edge pretty well easy touch up ceramic stick	1
i this thing personally i love it . while its not very pratical sword actual fighting number reasons , replicas like this aren't made anyway , but you just feel so powerful it . far weilding it , i found it not hard everyone says . i weild it pretty well although i am bigger guy . weight not 29 lbs though ... don't alarmed it more like 10 length just makes it feel really heavy	1
that one long sword ... i don't it but my friend . looks good but you really shouldn't go around swinging thing , it not like you're going expect fighting or practicing near 5'7 sword , but looks awesome , really worth money	1
i spent great deal time searching 5-bike rack . greater challenge find one i could afford . this rack fit bill . it considerably less expensive than other 5-bike racks , yet it works rather well . good points : - easily adapts various bike frame types . i carry one men frame , one old women 10-speed , women autobike , 24-inch women frame , 26-inch women mountain bike large tube design . each them fit rack without any additional parts or hardware . - solid design . it doesn't rock , sway or rattle , nor bikes . even freeway speeds , everything stays put . bad points : - less-than-easy installation . it comes bolt locking nut mounting receiver instead allowing use regular pin . hole too small pin . this supposedly make it more solid ( see good points above ) . however , i plan buying different collar-and-bolt style stabilizer , drill out hole so i use my locking pin . pulling out wrenches every time i want put rack or off my truck pain . - ok , i guess my only beef it right now . overall , you get more than you pay this rack . if you budget , i highly recommend it	1
i am satisified these gloves . however , i cut area ring finger index finger because it sewn too closely . when my hand glove area bit into my hand . i am uploading photo so see what i am talking because i may not explaining myself very well :) other than i like gloves . they smelled heavy chemicals when i got them . just fyi , you might want wash them your unimportant laundry get toxic smell out . i not wash mine . these gloves not turn my hands black . that nice . i first tried them sports authority i may not bought them . but after making small cuts gloves they perform fine	1

this mirror great ! it easy attach glasses very durable . it somewhat larger than other mirrors it provides very good field view . it very easy get used now i wouldn't ride traffic without it . one turn head i scan everything behind me - much more confidently than turning my head . mirror very durable . it fell out my pocket while attached sunglasses run over car . glasses ruined mirror unscathed i'm using it year later .	1
i took this weekend hiking/camping trip very pleased it . comfort astounded me perfectly honest . i told beforehand self-inflatable mats usually needed some help blowing up(via mouth)the first time or so because packaged so tightly period time . this true , but not problem whatsoever . it took only couple minutes it all set up it stayed full comfortable entire weekend . mat compacts fairly well definitely light enough take any hiking trip . i think it well worth money .	1

so far , two weeks handful workouts under my belt , i'm pleased xtreme 2 . unit very well built , heavy gauge steel tubing platform , cables pulley system appear very durable . it very easy adjust pulleys install/remove accessories . moving one exercise very quick once you get into routine . i'm still using basic 9-exercise routine , but book shows huge number variations exercises . this should keep me getting bored machine . i didn't like one exercises routine , finding worked same muscle group no problem . i found some exercises require you maintain somewhat difficult balancing position . i suppose this become easier my conditioning improves , again variety exercises available allow you avoid those too difficult . minor gripe some exercises bit uncomfortable . leg accessory , example , puts stress back my legs when doing extensions . padding could little softer reduce this discomfort . i've gym memberships many years prior owning xtreme 2 . this unit provides excellent workout privacy your own home . i'm sure i'll appreciate it even more january when i don't bundle up venture into 10 degree temperatures drive gym . i'll just walk down into basement shorts t-shirt get started	1
since assembling this product , we great fun playing against each other or individually . assembly instructions good up point assembling height-adjustment . it easier look picture box figure it out , rather than use instructions	1

i just opened my gazelle , after buying it myself christmas ( yes , i thought every excuse book ! ) i finally put it together my first workout ( i also bought tapes ) . i highly recommend getting tape because he teaches you all techniques time goes very quickly . i option doing 10 minutes ( beginner ) , 20 ( intermediate ) or 30 minutes ( advanced ) . i opted 20 minutes my first time it great . i really look forward doing this tomorrow ! again , tape great ( it 3-pack , i lower body workout ) because it not all just gliding back forth , tony teaches you it all different techniques !!! it also light easy fold up put away which plus . i look forward doing this tomorrow !!!!	1
i bought this because i just looking low cost machine i could use my spare time . i not looking hard-core workout machine , so gazelle edge perfect . there not any resistance , but i found if you buy some ankle weights use them while machine , it works very good . this machine perfect use while watching tv instead just sitting couch . i stress fractures running , there no impact , so this good machine get heart rate up good workout .	1
i this unit , pioneer avic-d2 headunit . i use it both xm navtraffic . i admit navtraffic incident report isn't always very up date , i really wish they would write when event occured . now it just says " accident , next quarter hour " but come back 30 minutes you still exact same message up screen . however , it much better highway information . also if highway traffic slow , you router programmed , unit ask if you wish go around traffic jam . sometimes alternative worse , because unit doesn't know " speeds " off highway , so if you choose avoid , you may get worse traffic jam . far xm , reception good , some channels times sound like 56kbps mp3 , but most time it good . also , it sometimes doesn't get artist song title information . i'm not sure if this unit fault or xm . i would definitly buy this unit again , especially navtraffic	1
no it isn't horse proof ! i think one horse thought it couple hay bales beside one ....... but i scared them off . fun ! this thing great ! after quick fold-up i started out storing it behind passenger seat but couldn't easily reach though back seat well . i optioned later store it above some added cargo straps i draped across front back sets entrance handles , sometimes provided cars , fold down aid person entering vehicle . so barely enough room top my head forget interior ceiling light , really unneeded i front map lights brighter anyway . get rainfly , it quickly placed strong rain if needed then secured better once back inside tent . when i want entertain breeze , i keep it folded inside should strong rain sneak up later wake me after peaceful driftin ' off . storage case nice now it home , but seldom used it road . separated somtimes wet/insect-filled ground great but after arriving cooler climates i debated just what i could use extra needed insulation below me , provided foam pad insert works well stability but little keep out cold . extra foam pad just seemed defeat portablilty issue , i decided just extra regular sleeping bag . current small " down " bag i using would insulate fine top it would stay fluffy , but my weight would compress " down " below me i found it little keep me warm underneath , but exceptional team-up new one insert . i yet try giant " down " bag later given me my older brother , i proceeded my journey . i should mention screening great , i doubt almost microscopic " no-seeums " could even pose problem . also i got more expensive version aluminum stucture which i would strongly advise standpoint less weight freedom possible corrosion . i even bought some pvc pipe cheap bungee cords made sort canopy using rainfly its zipper-open entrance .

i kind went overboard researching products this category . finally , i went straight person who'd first sleep it : my 21-year-old daughter . it would her bed during christmas vacation .

i am age 60 , plantar fasciitis ( foot pain ) cannot leave my disabled husband alone , so needed way exercise indoors . this 203 schwinn recumbent excellent . it clearly quality product , very quiet . seat supportive comfortable , so i not need use my hands steady myself . thus i begun doing arm lifts such while i ride , more complete workout . i am short 5 foot 2 1/2 inches , but closest seat setting , i reach pedals fine . anyone much shorter or very short legs might problems reaching . also , it not ' walk-through ' kind , so you must able lift your leg over center section use it . i wish it brighter or lighted digital readout , it would read my pulse only one hand side sensors , but those small problems . i recommend it highly would choose it again	1

i always nut buying new products when it comes basketball . i tried several basketballs when it comes higher level end balls . ncaa solution , naia rawlings leather , nba leather game , now nba composite game ball . i say when it comes grip , ncaa solution ball still tackiest basketballs , but new nba game ball much better initial grip than old leather ball . this some advantages disadvantagesgripadvantage - players smaller hands able grip this ball better . ball seems almost stick your hands whereas old leather game ball not . disadvantage - ball seems also stick backboard whereas other ball would glide off it . i find i problems bouncing ball , it not bounce properly , but this problem fixed after game playing . old leather balls took months before they lost their plastic like feel . i not feel ball gets slick when wet complaint nba players who played ball . obviously i am not caliber they , but i feel ball always constant grip whereas old leather game balls would get slick when we t.t he downside this all price . i feel 100 price tag most retailers charging this ball bit high . hopefully this ball go down price . i am hoping spalding take their cross traction technology their other composite balls way other players able take advantage new panels . panelsi really like new panels this ball . i feel bounce more consistent this new design . overalli still think i would prefer ncaa solution ball , but this ball very short life span . nba composite game ball high quality ball , but if you enjoy classic feel leather , you should buy old game balls before they entirely zone them out	1
we received this acquarium baby shower . first i concerned it going too tv-like . however , it very interactive appropriate broad range developmental levels . my daughter 8 months old still enjoys pulling lever spinning ball . far soothing instrument aid falling asleep , i can't say this provided anything like . however , often mornings she wake up play quietly 5-10 minutes	1
i love this basket . i wanted removable basket my crusier , but wicker looks best it . i like able put all my stuff basket then carry it around me . basket bigger than i thought it would , it sets up high my handlebars . because this i hard time mounting headlight , which required law ( where i live ) night	1
i this set , but not cool black color amazon . i got mine walley mart few dollars less . they sell dumbbells 24 pounds weights sixty dollars add 24 pound pack thirty . mine blue yellow so color amazon might worth spending few extra dollars . ( amazon since changed picture reflect what i color wise . ) said , i'm female , i interested bow flex 552 set until i saw it my local store . good god they huge ! i thought 220 set which i'm sure smaller but no one carried it store . since i didn't want go through hassle ship it back if i didn't like them , i passed 220 . sports blocks far smaller then bow flex set , perfect women or teens people not much space . weights themselves seem well made , my only concern changing pin changing weights . hand plastic two metal pins small knock you turn . you turn knob , pull pin out move it weight . knob what locks it place . i believe knob metal but again , it sits plastic housing ( handle ) i bad night mares it breaking while over my head . so far though they fine , just plastic makes me nervous when its holding 20 pounds over my precious skull . weights very easy change except when you try put all 48 pounds them . some reason it hard time lining up , pins plastic handle you really don't want force it . it would better charge 10 bucks make whole pin handle metal . other then , time tell how long this pin handle last . i hope gofit sells replacements it . still if your short cash but need good adjustable set , grow you , you really can't go wrong this set . i would given this set 5 if not plastic pin handle	1
i am very happy my purchase , unique way it allows you drink without raising your head . i got it mainly when i am my motorcycle	1
it nice boken , it feels nicely balanced , looks good , nice price . handle wrap main reason my purchase this item ; it keeps boken your hands even if they sweaty . i little wary wrapping come undone , so i just placed few drops super glue ends few places in-between , just make sure it stays place . it good practice sword it serves its purpose , worth buy my opinion . reviewer stated his boken broke when it struck , this may very well . however , it not because faulty craftsmanship , it because boken not meant contact . it purely device help you hone your sword handling skills without chopping off your arm , which you could real katana . if you want contact sword spar friends , i suggest getting shinai . unlike boken , shinai actually meant sparring not break under normal use	1

this fun throwback toy , but aware child you buying it should least 100 lbs order it effective . 80 lbs company recommends just little too light compress spring pogo stick . i would also recommend not using it rougher asphalt , what seems wear down tip most . using it smooth driveway concrete seems just fine , all neighborhood kids come around take turns bouncing around pogo stick . hey , its fun toy kids encourages exercise ( tried it out , it quite workout ! ) there obvious safety issues part parcel toy this nature , but not just specific this particular pogo stick , it pogo sticks general , so it somewhat unfair single out this paricular product " hazardous "	1

i switched these my continental semi-slicks after numerous punctures few near wipeouts wet corners . continentals not grip road well enough when there just thin layer water i've too many punctures . michelins , other hand , proven plenty sticky keep rubber side firmly down . puncture resistance great too , thanks protective liner . i don't think it actually kevlar ( many other brands/models ) but it fine last 1,000 miles . they very stiff bead little tough seat into tubeless-ready rims ( mavic crosslands ) but little liquid soap wiped onto bead really helps . added bonus reflective sidewall you end up presenting two huge , lighted hoops cars getting ready t-bone you night :) [ but officer , i didn't see him]great buy , you won't regret it	1
after two or three other products this type which not last , we found mini-jammer . this last one we need purchase	1

we bought these so children could something play during winter . we backed our vehicles out garage , zoom .... they off fun . box says " ages 3+ " up 55 pounds . bumper buggie looks small , but it roomy enough my 5 1/2 year old . he weighs 45 pounds 45 inches tall . he stretch his legs out car , but chooses keep his knees bent while driving . my two year old also work controls . it easy use kids complete 360 . my only complaint it little bit noisy , but no more than other battery-operated vehicles . i highly recommend this item . it so much fun ! best part there little assembly required . only thing we screw seat into car	1

excellent accessory kids ' play snow . helps them construct something they enjoy building using	1
when i bought igolf caddie i really some questions how good it would . especially since it so much cheaper than its highly advertised competitor . before buying , i checked sure courses i play most database , they all there . i problem , when i first turned unit i received error message when trying install software . i uninstalled software reinstalled it couple times but could not get unit work so i sent email technical support saturday morning . i expected reply monday afternoon . well i received response within couple hours explanation link download latest version software . i everything worked great . i used igolf caddie first time next day ( sunday ) . course i played recently swapped front nine back nine when i turned igolf caddie i noticed it still old configuration . since i could select hole independently it not much problem . when i got home sunday afternoon i emailed them let them know front back nines swapped . this sunday afternoon , they responded within hours saying problem corrected . i downloaded new setup everything worked great . since then i used igolf caddie 10 times it perfect everytime . i use ' hole marker ' feature note some ' layup ' points ' carry ' points . it performed flawlessly i believe pulled least two strokes average off each game . able see distance ' front ' , ' back ' ' center ' green i find myself making sure i carry least front green . this really helped . i'm pretty aggressive golfer nature this helps me make better course management decisions remain fairly agressive . bottom line product works great my experience their technical support nothing short remarkable . they give type support i wish i could find other companies . i'm still process marking different points some holes , but overall i'm low 80 now hoping some high 70 here pretty soon . few tips , first get yourself some rechargeable batteries since batteries go down 50% after one round . i bought nmh batteries they work great , just don't forget put switch ' rechargeable ' igolf unit . second , since i tend scratch front screen my cellphone i could see me doing same thing here , so i put piece clear shipping tape over screen then used razor knife cut around it . way i replace tape when it gets scratched without damaging screen ( i same thing my cellphone ) . bottom line , unit delivers promised i would recommend it anyone wanting improve their game	1
work out while you're sitting front television . though this piece equipment not intensive workouts , it great workout very little effort	1
i knew this scope wasn't made airsoft rifles , but i mounted this baby my utg master sniper , they seem made each other . they complement each other nicely looks , feel , operability . scope comes necessary rings , two flip up lens covers , protective lens covers ( which , unfortunately , drastically reduce visibility ) sunshade practically eliminate glare unless you're looking straight sun itself . i've used this scope every other day nearly 8 months it its job like its fresh out box . only complaint i've got mounting rings rusting , which me baffled because they haven't any contact water or any other sever element . scope itself fine though . magnification great , though detail slightly blurred high magnification . i back this one all way	1
i bought " magic circle " efforts up anty my pilates routine . i am glad i purchased it but i found dvd 2 star out 5 start rating . since i live far away pilates studio i purchased other dvds efforts learn magic circle . dvd classical pilates inc . called " complete magic cirlce mat series reformer mat workout " ( also amazon.com)taught me more circle use than dvd came it . it basic straight forward mat routine dvd but it practical i am well my way more complete pilates workout . i also use magic circle burn off extra energy while sitting i find my boyfriend picks it up uses it get few exercises every day . it used many ways but it most certainly enhances pilates work out	1

this trailer absolutely perfect my two-year-old daughter who still little young her own bike , but wants go rides mom dad . she enjoying it even fell asleep it few times . i recommend propping up pillows or towels next your child if you think he/she may fall asleep . if not , she bent over half ! i surprised i didn't really feel awkward or much extra weight behind me ( my daughter weighs least 32 lbs . ) . we live very flat area , so must help . we ordered extra coupler company dad bike , so it easy either us pull her . we recently took our bikes trailer weekend trip , i pleased see set up break down pretty simple . trailer fit trunk easily . i definitely recommend this trailer am very happy i bought it	1

schwinn 418 elliptical trainer solid well built . it operation quiet it makes exercising painless possible . it excellent value consumer elliptical machine home use . problem i assembly . instruction manual very confusing since it not clearly differentiate various sizes parts not state some parts already attached pedals not hardware packets . there two washers missing two plastic caps which not labeled determine left or right since they two different parts but looked identical . i also difficulty getting one pedal assemblies fit properly since one welded brackets misaligned . i called customer service they quickly sent me complete package hardware assure i all necessary parts . i highly recommend 418 elliptical trainer , but make sure you identify sort all parts before you begin assembly so you don't come up short .	1
we tried numerous flotation swimsuits , life jackets our 3-year-old little boy . they all huge disappointment - either his mouth under water or flotation device overpowered him , bobbing him forward or backward into water . this swim trainer swimline solved problem , it exactly what it supposed - keep child above water , either upright or swimming position . he move freely switch swimming upright floating effortlessly , never losing his balance or confidence . vest style upper body goes off very easily . we also tried similar swim trainer attached shorts , found crotch would just ride up , making it quite uncomfortable little boys . we prefer this ' vest only ' style , worn regular swim shorts . it stays him till adult takes it off . our son likes thrown up air , then splash into water - swim trainer stays him nicely , he cannot slip out it , no matter how wiggly he gets . wearing swim trainer regular shim shorts also nice when we beach or pool party - don't strip child naked when he ready get out water . he keep his swim shorts continue play dry land . it strong inner tube built-in ( not like cheap plastic rings made material like beach balls ) . you need bike pump or air compressor inflate - if you don't one , you take it gas station , use same pump you use your car tires . you cannot blow this up mouth . it truly great item , looks nice , durable , affordable most importantly , works . we very pleased .	1

i so frustrated those so called " sticky mats " skidless towels , i left everything try jade harmony mat . this product worked really well my slipping issues . when my yoga classes get really hot however , i notice i may slide little down dog but it nothing like any other mat i've tried . some people complain weight rubber mat , since it comes 3 different thicknesses . since i scoliosis want carry little possible my back , i chose get thinnest rubber mat ( 1/8 " travel mat ) . while yoga studio , i place one their common mats under my mat added cushion . i also recommend doing this since rubber mat tends dust magnet . so if floor isn't cleanest ( say if you practice gym studio ) , dust , hair fuzz tends attract ma t.t he smell harmony mat overwhelming when you first get it . it would make my entire room smell rubber when i trying air it out . smell , however , fortunately goes away over time . just make sure you air it out much possible . i've my harmony mat 10 months now i don't notice any wear it	1

i looking challenging low impact workout couldn't find one until i found low max . this great workout i raised my step 8 " i feel burn :) cathe wonderful instructor i really become addicted her workouts . my cardiovascular conditioning bumped up notch thanks all her challenging yet fun workouts . great music , great instructor	1
finally , i able try one cathe friedrich new dvds . her " low max " workout intense , but fun . i really enjoyed it burned ton calories process . this workout mostly low impact step routine intervals floor toning , but it isn't easy any means . i don't recommend it beginners or anyone two left feet ! music great , but fast tempo intense pace frustrate those new step aerobics . cathe mixes few dance moves , like mambo chacha , so choreography may require some amount practice . still , if you're up challenge looking workup serious sweat , this dvd you . :-) i plan order more dvds cathe future . she good job cueing looks great ! wow scale : 9 ( out 10)difficulty : advancedstudio setting : bit boring , but current times	1

my son his friend enjoy this scooter very much . it handles very well	1
i am 16 i tried this out park few days ago . this thing so fun ride ! it lean side side , front turns , all indenepently so you choose how much bank turn . i don't understand why this sold toys ' ' us , considering it something would appeal more adults . you get into high 30s if you found big enough hill . wheels only problem , whether cut production costs or save kids lives reducing speed , it hamper it abilities carve since they made plastic . if you really plan buy this , want it go smooth fast possible , find shop sells longboarding wheels ( prefferably sector 9 ) 70mm or above , stick them this thing it much smoother , faster , grippier ride . i suggest no one under 12 ride this down any big hills . i seriously think they would kill themselves unless supervised someone who could stop them	1

i am very pleased ease assembly quality this treadmill . it everything i hoped it would . ie : easy use , quiet yet challangeing .	1
only thing i wish this treadmill included option would allow me save my settings workout . there several pre-programmed workouts , i've tried most or all them . over time , my speed increasing , so i'm not using pre-programmed settings as-is . i typically one or more button presses each time treadmill changes part program , order increase speed where i want it . aside , however , this wonderful machine . our old treadmill finally died after 10 years or so . i hadn't really doing enough workout it . bowflex series 3 , i set treadmill program time i want start working out . doing this every day , i've started slowly lose little weight , more importantly , my hdl ( good cholesterol ) increased over past few months 38 current 54 ( goal least hdl 60 ) . i absolutely credit this machine substantial improvement my health	1
this treadmill great product -- very sturdy runs smooth . it better than treadmills i using high-priced gym where i member . only problem i encountered getting it into house -- it took 3 strong guys grunting pretty hard get it house . once inside , though , set-up easy took 30 minutes . only thing needed phillips screwdriver ( one supplied could it-but it wasn't too easy it . ) all all , i am really happy this treadmill--it well made product	1
i'm very satisfied my two " hummer " radios they very sturdy very high quality . i no issue handle feeling " like it break easily " no big issue light button either however i agree small analog tuning wheel nearly impossible read but i'm capable finding stations i listen minimal inconvenience . i didn't buy this everyday radio , only emergencies . what i particularly like radio it smaller size compared other similar wind-up radios . my wife i both small , go anywhere , fanny-pack style survival kits these radios perfect fit room spare	1
researched every trike known google , i decided buy two these my twins ' 3rd birthday presents . my deciding factors these metal frames ( most trikes now plastic lightweight ) , they low ground so balance hardly even issue , wheels proper wheels inflate not plastic . so comfort movability great . weight , size tires low profile makes tipping almost impossible . nice thing seat adjusts very easily accomodate our 5 year old who asked one his birthday . they look cool too . they need assembled but instructions good . first one took me 10 minutes second one took me 5 minutes . only negative both front wheels arrived flat so we pump them up before we could use them . not big deal given how cold it , not surprising there some flat tires	1

when buggie arrived , it didn't work . i call razor customer service dept . their service awful . senior agent very rude . i managed figure out problem my own . electrical unit not connected . once it connected , it worked fine . we two them . kids love them . they lightweight ride well carpet . overall , product good .	1
we bought these so children could something play during winter . we backed our vehicles out garage , zoom .... they off fun . box says " ages 3+ " up 55 pounds . bumper buggie looks small , but it roomy enough my 5 1/2 year old . he weighs 45 pounds 45 inches tall . he stretch his legs out car , but chooses keep his knees bent while driving . my two year old also work controls . it easy use kids complete 360 . my only complaint it little bit noisy , but no more than other battery-operated vehicles . i highly recommend this item . it so much fun ! best part there little assembly required . only thing we screw seat into car	1

i can't believe some companies charge $86 same concept . this one cost $6 ! possibly cheapest us market . performing this excercise extremely hard . i first saw this standing jackie chan movie " gorgeous " . you need strong abs chest start , plus good arms keep balance , if you want perform this level . when you start out your knees . sure wear gloves , handles stiff plastic . then try just one complete rep celebrate . if returning original position ( pinching your abs together ) hard , then try resetting yourself just concentrate going down ( stretching your back abs out ) . then next day try 2 reps . then take day off . overdoing painful next morning . i really recommend doing this excercise your first workout before working other parts your body . it would tough even hold thing together after pumping your tri/bicepts or shoulders . tip leave inch gap wheels wrapping some rope around bar make balancing act lot easier . finally , i happy say after few months doing this my knees i able start off standing position jackie chan style . i pretty strong six pack now , i take blows 10 year old . but i still nice sheet flab over my abs lack running this winter . goodluck those who dare this feat .	1
this great little device work your abs , but it not going give you six pack all itself ... you need watch your diet well . two tips : 1 . make sure you stretch before use ; especially your back shoulders , since they getting workout too . 2 . use it thick carpet or put folded towel under your knees ; you'll lot more comfortable . all all , this far superior more expensive ab devices you see late night tv	1

over last 2 years , i member 4 different gyms . i traveled lot overseas during time , so i juggled memberships quite bit ended up paying way more than i wanted . my usual trips gym took 2-4 hours including travel time , i'm pretty motivated person , but after while , it just becomes too difficult get myself gym because time money involved . after coming back recent 1 year trip overseas , i've decided look into home gyms save both money time . after extensive research , i ended up purchase conquest here amazon . some other machines i looked platinum crossbow , total gym , bandflex . after comparing all machines going local sporting store try out bowflex , i no doubt bowflex well worth money . other machines might cheaper , smaller easier assemble . but i found bowflex quality difficult match . setup : i put together machine 2 hours . all you need couple screw drivers , everything else needed package . instructions easy follow makes logical sense . however , my bowflex , like many others , arrived missing few parts . my case it just few washers couple screws , nothing critical , but such problems seemed common what i've read . operation : if you not used bowflex yet , you treat . power rods provide very smooth resistance wonderful range motion . resistance builds you flex power rods , very easy joints beginning motion , yet still provides enough break down your muscles toward end motion . dvd provides instruction basic exercises ( 15 ) , manual covers over 60 different exercises . lot them simply variations exercise , but i found myself creating new ways exercise not covered included material . weight type exercises easy change , not interfere your workout . i found this very good time saver vs waiting machines gym . size : no matter how many times you seen bowflex tv , you won't realize how big machine truly until you put it together . conquest easily 7ft tall , takes huge amount space my living room . it wheels , but you not able fit it through most doors , so think long hard before you decide which room you place it . value : i ordered here amazon because awesome discounted price they , evident fact machine sold out 2 days after i placed my order . but after using machine week , i honestly say i would gladly pay full price machine . like any other piece exercise equipment , if you make good use it , it worth every penny . i noticed this machine nearly identical more expensive sport model , but hundreds cheaper . summary : this best item i purchased 2006 , over years i always ignored bowflex tv ads considered it fad . but conquest proved its worth dozen times over last week ; once machine works better than advertised . pros : solid construction , long warranty , exercise variety , smooth motion , easy operation , great long term value . cons : setup time , size , missing partsneutral : decent resale value	1

i bought this use my mr. bento lunch kit , i'm satisfied it . spoon deep enough useful ( larger bowl than , example , average plastic spoon ) fork simply its job . knife edge useful foods already fairly tender ( ie ., tender enough cut edge metal fork ) , but limitation you only knife , not utensil hold food place ( since knife actually edge fork ) . sure pack napkin , though , since it'll need wipe when you switch spoon fork . handle bit short , which why i take off star . all all , though , it exactly what i hoping it would , i would recommend lunch kits , etc .	1

this one perfect set tools , my opinion . scissors , most people want . victorinox saw outstanding . careful , it make quick work your fingers ; it very sharp cuts aggressively . it also good opener bottle opener separate tools . victorinox opener works wonderfully , but combo tool which bottle opener rolled into one doesn't work well cans . also , opener handy little screwdriver tip which used philips screwdriver sometimes . reamer lot more handy than you would think , though not reamer . i use it change watch bandes , sharp tip reaches releases spring bars without too much fuss . most used tool me though large screwdriver tip bottle opener . one disadvantage this one it starting get bit thick carry your pocket . belt sheath would more appropriate , if you pull off without feeling too geeky . ( personally , i don't care , hehehe	1

sleep pad essential gear backpacking , especially when backpacking cold weather . when you sleep sleeping bag , your body weight compresses insulation bottom side your bag which lead hiker losing warmth ground below . sleep pad provides insulation cold ground well additional comfort hard surfaces . thermarest ridge rest sleeping pad both those jobs adequately but not exceptionally . insulation adequate job keeping one warm , but pad too thin provide much extra comfort . perhaps bit weakness terms comfort , this attributes makes pad extremely light which great when you carry it you . if your primary concern comfort , go inflatable pad . if you're more concerned weight , go this pad	1

they bit tight . i'm competitive swimmer who originally depended prescription goggles purchased taiwan , but when they broke , i went online find other options . i found these goggles , remembering generally high quality goggles speedo ( before my prescription goggles , i only wore speedo women vanquisher goggles ) , i bought these . they fit rather well , i guess only qualm i how goggles feel like they're sucking my eyeballs out . that what i mean tight ; straps fine . i haven't yet tried these pool , but what i tell now , they aren't going most confortable goggles ever . if you've tried speedo vanquisher goggles , you should know rubber lining forms little air pocket extra cushioning . these goggles , however , don't offer . they just one layer rubber which , my opinion , only helps fend off mold grew my vanquishers . bravo . if you swim lot think you get use slightly uncomfortable goggles , go this pair .	1
i've using these couple months now . they not exact match my prescription but they excellent swimming . i spoke my eye care professional them he said they great deal . if you aren't sure what strength you need ( if you astigmatism , etc ) your eye doc should able give you recommendataion doesn't always match your prescription # but work you . also , these don't leak	1

my daughter got both mozart magic cube sing me cube christmas this year , we love them both ! i am music teacher , i think these just really cool musical toys young children . sound much better than i expected , my daughter loves them both . i give this one 4 stars instead 5 only because songs kind hard sing because music little elaborate . it easier kids sing simple arrangements , cube songs lots notes ... which make them great listen , but maybe little tough child sing . not reason not buy , though ! lots fun , potential interesting toy few years .	1

i like this workout . i lot firm dvds i like you squeeze resistance training short amount time . i pair this workout cardio one or it alone lazy day . this workout not formatted like traditional firm dvds only person who look familier ali . only thing you need cords come dvd	1
these cords quick , simple eay way squeeze fitness into your daily routine . workout 30 mins simple cardio , strength training cool down . forewarned cords first , awkward use , especially leg exercises . they may seem short or not pliable but changes more you use them . they also work best running shoes because there arch keeps it sliding ... i tried routine some flat pumas practically smacked myself face because cords couldn't find grip . tina coaching clear easy .... entire routine mirror image ... so you just go wherever she ... this dvd would def work well while traveling ... this routine wont get you profusely sweating but still great buy nonetheless ..	1

i'm very hard my gear this watch withstood it all . it all features you could ask watch plus few you would never expect . large easy read numbers when your difficult situations or akward positions even while scuba diving ( note : it says not press buttons underwater , but its still readable without backlight ... usually ) great feature although it large watch , it certain style all its own . i think compass my favorite feature great while orienting yourself trail map . also great conversational piece while breaking ice board room ... " my watch helps me predict weather " :-d ... ok maybe not best thing tell your boss , but still amazing watch :-)	1

i love my fuel belt . it light flexible . if i one complaint it belt tends fit snuggly . small really small , so order up one size . velcro belt ensure snug fit . bottles tends slip your hands when you perspire , but overall it great training tool .	1

108 " hand wraps ( such everlast 4455s ) too short most people properly wrap their hands , unless they very small hands such some females or juniors . if you normal or large-size hands or use any wrapping technique uses lot cloth , like one wraps each finger , i strongly recommend going 180 " wrap such these . it may seem like long piece cloth , but you'll quickly use it up protecting your knuckles wrist . remember , don't hit punching bag or anything else without properly protecting your hands wraps gloves . these everlast wraps cheap basic protection	1
first thought , when i took it out box , how sturdy it felt . after easy instructions followed it put together flash ( not there much all ) . all fairness , i don't use counter all . i just use it timed cardio device , i am not looking numbers . i use it everyday it works . would recommend	1

i really like these gloves . they provide good protection , they go easily wrap tight . they provide faster better protection than conventional wraps . it easy learn how get them off quickly . follow instructions comes them it becomes second nature no time all . i think velco " cross wraps " back glove could designed better . they don't add lot glove support they don't connect very well . but even without them this great product i readily recommend	1

first off , let me say i little skeptical performance this set . every review i read near perfect , if not perfect . my mother $150 electric sharpener , i didn't feel $45 sharpener could good ... i got it today . my coveted wusthof blades losing their edge , suddenly they seemed less attractive . i am not pro , nor i spent significant amount time sharpening anything substancial . my knives now sharper than when i purchased them . no kidding ! i'm running around house looking things sharpen . what i tell , this almost perfect system ( what it ) . it sharpens just everything doesn't blunt end or major nick/gouge . thing i loved most control system ( which you just don't get electric sharpeners ) . you put sharp or ' dull ' edge you'd like your blade , depending task , depending what type cutting tool it . you tell it works ( any other sharpening activity ) because there less frictional noise resistance you increase amount sharpening strokes . dvd manual make learning whole process really easy if you aren't already know ... my mother $150 electric sharpener never put edge my knives or her knives like one i now . fact , i'm confident if you give me blind test ( pepsi challenge , if you ) two knives my mom sharpener spyderco , i would bet anyone i could pick spyderco every single time . stones appear very high quality , seem extremely hard . i don't foresee needing new stones quite while , but even if i , i buy them separately . i'm cutting my vegetables , almost forgot how dull most people , including myself allow their allow their knives get before sharpening them , them sharpened , or throwing them away . i wish knives really never lose their edge ( like those cheesy knife cutting infomercials ) ... but reality , unless you like throwing away money , you're gonna sharpen them sooner or later . buy this sharpener . buy this sharpener ... yourself favor .... buy this sharpener .	1

we used this first time this summer . bag held up well during 600+ miles interstate driving . it let some water through during rain , but not real bad . sure pack your items plastic bags if they're predicting rain or go more expensive waterproof thule bags . this much more convenient than big plastic cargo boxes since it folds up so small , goes it own carry bag , fits closet shelf . it also goes vehicle quickly four straps . very easy use	1
i bought this 2-man tent use while backpacking . it sets up hurry , very durable , very light 2-man tent . i generally backpack one my kids , this hold two us , plus change clothes our small gear no problem . there two doors , which great , so we don't climb over each other get out tent . outside each door small vestibule , which great place put your shoes keep them dry . tent poles ( 2 ) aluminum , they very strong light . i also like fact this tent free standing . once you get it set up , you move it around easily if you're not happy location . this great backpacking tent money . it hold two people just few things comfortably , or one person all your gear comfortably . there lighter tents out there , but you'll pay them	1

pros : reliable floor pump features frame pump size , hose relieves stem snappingcons : potential over pressure due ease use ( but hurt me this one)this thanksgiving i rode 75 miles relatives . six flats later four stops filing slow leakers , i only hour late . topeak road morph only reason i made it all . i tried tested almost all small frame pumps market . some don't work all when you need them some best snapping stems . few get high pressure tire . topeak road morph clearly winner my book . topeak rm perfect blend floor pump light frame pump . where i ride i reliability good pump topeak rm only one i use . tip : before your next long distance or solo ride , get topeak rm . if you don't get one christmas , go buy one . you thank your lucky stars when it performs when you need it	1

i bought this little tyke my little brother christmas he loves it . it glock 26 compact design allows easy use people smaller hands , which case my little brother , not so much my case since i'm over 6'5 . red dot top , most part , pure asthetics although it tweaked fairly accurate up 30 feet ( common effective/accurate range airsoft pistols imo ) although it fps not entirely impression . don't get me wrong , it'll still get your attention if you get hit but it range limited compared others . silencer/supressor pure asthetics but it actually serves stabilizer/rifling rounds . i tried 10 shots supressor off found i more accurate it ; could personal preference or not but it worth exploring . magazine capacity , most state regulations real sidearms place it 10 rounds so this actually serves two purposes . ) it promotes accuracy making-them-count shots opposed random rambo shooting many weekend warriors adhere ) allows adults teach novices children firearm safety . i would recomend using this airsoft pistol trainer children hoping use real firearms , especially parents . it breaking easily , my little brother takes it out , bashes it around shoots it frequently so far , no problems . perhaps i'm just extremely lucky . few words caution though ; not go rambo this keep shooting shooting . all firearms , not just airsoft , limits how much strain internal mechanisms take . if you continually shoot it without stopping don't surprised if internal parts break . make your shots count , concise . if you want airsoft handgun better continuous firing rate , get co2 powered sidearm but ready shell out more coin . all all , dandy weapon price but if you want quality , ready get what you pay	1

this basketball goal good value money . it sturdy relatively easy put together ( my wife it under 2 hours , though i should mention she mechanically inclined ) . nothing base , i carry it . it also wheels base portability . i filled base up hose anchor it . it very easy fill hose . so far , goal stood up well some rough play , including lots dunks . here three negatives : 1 ) backboard little small . 2 ) mentioned product description , base takes up lot area . there no getting around this . it tradeoff making it portable . 3 ) even lowest setting ( 7 ft ) , it too high my 7-year old daughter ( even one smaller basketballs ) . it takes almost all her strength make basket . i plan get around height problem getting soccer ball or something lighter her shoot . she not very strong so if you strong 7-year old , it should fine . if i it over again , i would probably get one cheaper , smaller goals , but this one made well enough so it still around when my daughter strong enough easily shoot 7 ft . goal	1

i bought this trainer use indoors during san francisco rainy winter season . i thought it might nice just mount my own bike rather than driving gym somewhere paying membership fees , waiting available spincycle , etc . i am most impressed quality construction ease use . it even comes it own skewer so i don't scuff up my expensive skewer during mounting process . it very attractive , very well made , seems work great after first one-hour test ride least . i bought fron t-t ire leveling block well combination makes very stable platform which ride my own bike my own room while watching movie , reading , or listening music . what could better , all measly 80 bucks . i regular rear road tire contacts resistance roller noise factor quite low - nothing should disturb anyone my opinion . only improvement i could suggest would one or two more levels resistance - this unit set highest level doesn't really give resistance close what you would get climbing hill , but i got good heart rate going dripping sweat . it certainly get me through those rainy days where i simply wouldn't get my bike out road . 80 bucks i am highly pleased .	1

we found this light very good quality . when purchasing , we also considered similar light black decker . this light seemed sturdier tighter construction . we bought locally , so we option testing these store , before we bought ( they all come packages which allow crank free , so you try them . both models , we discovered some work better than others . what i mean some bd work better than other bd some iluminators work better than others . this may due way they treated store - some used over over again before purchase . it took while , but we found one held charge long time . fact , when i charged it home , it lasted bright light ( three leds ) 1.5 hours kept emitting dim light 12 hours . one bd we purchased ( returned ) stayed only 10 seconds after charged two munutes ( not useful ) . advice : these internet-ordered probably more likely free in-store over-use ( repeat - probably ) . however , you also can't try them before buying . so , like many things you'll need weigh those pros cons . if you get good one , you'll probably agree it very good little flashlight	1
if you find better scope 14 dollars , let me know . this scope amazing super easy fine tune . if you're tight budget , or if you just want good scope , this it . warning : you need buy scope rings mount it	1
if you into your outdoor lifestyle , enjoy getting away few days into bush , igloo cooler box much needed necessity . i used them zambezi valley zimbabwe , they performed brilliantly , keeping ice intact several days , despite temperatures shade over 40 deg cent . work very well dry ice , recommend putting wet towel over coolerbox wetting this regularly , assist keeping temp down . end day , you cant go wrong good kit , well worth every cent paid !!	1

this alarm higher quality ( but more expensive ) than most other small battery-operated apartment/home burglary alarms , sense movement quite well . me , it big plus not only it loud audible alarm when tripped , but also small strobe-like pulsing light , well ability turn unit off single ( included ) remote control ( fyi : fact , remote only way unit * * turned or off ) . it also looks somewhat imposing , if it part " real " , hard-core wired alarm system . only slightly negative issue remote control only works range five feet ( alarm motion sensing capability , however , far longer than -- but this not problem because alarm delayed 12 seconds allow you get close enough turn unit off before alarm/strobe activates ) . you may also want purchase remote ( which amazon also sells ) if you spouse or child .	1
it common scenario . you haven't taken your raft out year or more because you've just too busy bothered it . finally , you're camping lake weekend you excitedly bring your raft out . it great last time you inflated it , so there should no problems , right ? you get lake , bring out your boat , pump it up real tight . you place it water go . ten minutes out , your raft isn't quite solid , but you dismiss it cold water causing air inside slow down - lower pressure . ten minutes your raft practically bending half . seahawk 200 not give you this problem . pvc clearly sturdier than typical cheap raft . $25 cheap two person raft . i don't get raft out often , but five years , it always reliable . you won't fit two large people it , but my wife i fit okay . only downside pump . it sucks . it too little take while fill up . get either big foot pump or electric one you'll much happier .	1

i used sky caddie several different courses found it exactly advertised . its great knowing exactly where you course well situational awareness fairway boundaries obstacles . my game continues improve i depend my sky caddie ... wish i bought it sooner	1
other reviewer said , don't expect this perfectly round , if you want one those get one balanced not leather . i prefer this over plastic or rubber because it doesn't slip when you sweating . only downfall i would note stitching not leather , it rigid plastic . not big deal , but i caught it just right before it scratch . overall it great workouts working muscles hard get typical free weights . most places this much more money or really unreasonable shipping	1
battery keeps charge very long . it very cute great quality ! thanks !	1
everlast family training set so usefull . but there sth which i dont like . boxing gloves so small . anyway i like it	1
i understand disappointment other reviewers , but coaster brakes makes use reverse tantion chain , which impossible transmission using derailleur mechanism . this first one my list planned purchase my daughter turninig 8 . don't it , so ca't really rate it , but looks like good choice . 20 inch model rarely comes transmission . i re-rate it when i get it	1
i practicing power yoga 4-5 times per week over year . after mats repeatedly wore out me , my instructor recommended manduka mat . she using hers over 2 years it still looks like new . it took few weeks coating ( makes it little slippery first ) scent dissipate , but after initial break-in period , this mat stood up lots wear . i love it so much i bought one my husband one my mom . manduka mat provides great traction . i am able hold balance poses easily my mat ( something i found more difficult softer mats ) . it amazingly durable ( no nicks or scratches after few months use ) . size ... i love it . i am 5'9 " i like deep warrior pose - this mat , i don't worry going over edge . my 6 ' husband agrees . caution - this mat little larger heavier than most found gym or sporting-goods store , so if looking mat bag , test out size strength bag mat before purchasing one .	1
perfect yoga mat . some cushioning , but not too much . but heavy side if you wanting take it somewhere	1
i am very pleased this floor , although suprised how light it . i expecting more rubber material , but this much more cushion . it seems very durable though	1

i am 60 years old lady probably average technical understanding . advertisement bike said " minor assembly required " . but it turned out assembly somewhat challenge , not only me but also my husband ! we only learned owner manual following tools required : - philips head screw driver- 4mm , 5mm , 6mm 8mm allen keys- adjustable wrench or 9mm , 10mm , 14mm $ 15mm open box end wrenches- pair pliers cable cutting ability . we not all those tools house i go out borrow friends . it would helpful if required tools already included package . addition , owner manual covers many different types bikes it not always easy find paragraphs relevant assembly this particular bike . it took me two days finally get everything together ! other than , this china made bike coaster brakes comfortable sturdy i now ride it happily around neigborhood .	1
love these gloves . use them mountain biking wrist support palm padding . also , use them floor workouts support when bearing weight hands . course , always use them weight lifting -- easy adjust stiffness . i bought two sets birthday gifts . very well made . very good experience vendor	1
harbinger makes great weight lifting glove . my last pair ( harbinger 130 ) endured three years 5 day week heavy lifting ( ok , heavy subjective but 315lb shrug good glove test ) . i replaced black gel-padded harbingers these am ambivalent improvements . first , i not see whole lot merit encasing back hand leather , especially since back only single-stitched . flexible fabric cheaper gloves worked fine wasn't subject loose threads . secondly , rubber pads never going flexible gel pads . perhaps if i pressing 450 instead half , then it might make big difference , but then , i seen guys get weight barehanded well . one serious advantage these gloves over less expensive ones finger tip leather goes all way end triple-stitched reinforcement . my fingers eventually cut crescents out unreinforced finger-ends 130s .	1
i recently got anakin skywalker , darth vader fx saber . they both great . they light up great , look even better camera ! highly recommended	1

razor a3 very good kid scooter . it pretty well built ( see below ) , solid , easy use , easy learn . our son loves it ! it little bit hard close ( but that not bad thing really ) . almost immediately , piece plastic wraps around front bed come loose . it doesn't seem much function other than cosmetic , but still shouldn't happen gives impression less than excellent craftsmanship . $44 scooter , i can't complain too much . i'd recommend this scooter : we'd buy it again would recommend others	1
this bike smooth riding packs great features . shifting easier than any other bike i ridden . only downside i think seat bit hard , but upgrade takes care	1
i really like this piece equipment . instructions setup easy follow assembly simple . there no damaged pieces . it very sturdy looks like it last years . i get great workout my abdominal muscles - i think its easier than doing situps because your legs held place supports , plus you working out more muscles hyperextending abdominals . i don't use it much extending back but similarly easy use . first time i used it my torso sore few days , now i am using it almost every day seeing results just few weeks . its not too big room leave it corner my bedroom so i use it quickly morning or evening	1

this seems , me , very high-security lock . i bought it protect my new bike , after my previous bike stolen thieves who cut through onguard rottweiler armored cable lock . i don't think onguard beast could cut hand tools . shackle lock such tight fit chain it leaves no room pry bars pull it apart . however , this heaviest bike lock i've every seen . typical u-lock weighs less than three pounds . ( kryptonite new york u-lock just under four . ) beast 5017 weighs almost ten , more than even kryptonite new york fahgettaboudit chain , which it resembles . you'll some way carrying it . i don't think you simply wrap such bulky , heavy chain around your seat post , though i ride recumbent say sure . if you expect put it messenger bag or backpack , put ten pounds rocks your bag ride around bit before purchasing this lock . i suspect only good way carry it strap it down rack . also , beast two-piece padlock inconvenient . when you unlock it , shackle pulls all way out separates . usually it falls onto ground . when locking it , you assemble chain , shackle , lock hold them together ( all while keeping bike place ) while you turn key . onguard could made this more convenient padlock automatically lock when you pushed shackle . onguard supposedly offers anti-theft warranty lock , though warranty came mine said " void out state new york " . like most lock warranties , you can't make claim without evidence ( damaged lock ) someone cut through it hand tools . pros : extremely securemore flexible than u-lockcons : very heavydifficult carry bikea bit clumsy userecommendation : i would recommend good u-lock riders bikes use one . get onguard beast only if you need super-high security or bike won't work standard u-lock	1

_i collected swords , both eastern western , over 30 years now , i finally bought this model out curiosity . it far better both quality design than i expected . this good quality blade . steel good , rigid , stainless variety seems hold its edge . you could chop through fence pole it it would not fold up you . _while this not full-length katana , it good useable length use tight quarters- it also easily drawable your back without hanging up sheath . hilt covered wrapped nylon over plastic , course since tang one piece blade there nothing separate . i find overall look clean modern- not cheap . flat black finish not catch light . there elegant simplicity this tool . _the sheath especially nice- it mount your back or your hip . it solid constuction not pierce or pull off first time it snags branch or fence . nylon , it not rot or rust- like sword itself . _there some cheaper knock-offs this blade market even less , but you much better off stick proven quality united cutlery . _a sword either tool ill-omen , or spiritual symbol , depending inner development its wielder ....	1
it great value . i used it 2 months ( 3 times week , 30 min each ) i start seeing results ( not spectacular , but you tell there difference ! ) . only downsides pieces . there not last long . good thing it comes ( 3 months ) warranty co . shipped replacements very fast . i really recommend it if you want excercise without spending lots money . i am very very happy it	1
i little worried when i got this machine becvause low price , but it excellent piece equipmen t.t he machine very easy put together , you keep track how many calories you burn . it easy change your resistance level , machine timer stop if your form not correct . oar design ( versus one bar design most machines ) works more muscles your arms chest . i also find it great stress reliever . it may sound cheesy , but sometimes i like put music , close my eyes imagine i am rowing lake . it very relaxing . i wish there way track distance mile however , if you start going it really fast you start hear strange sounds , so i think moderate exercise best this machine . also , someone who very overweight or tall it may akward get into feet stirrups or seat . i am 155lb woman , my butt covers whole seat , so seat may not wide enough someone much heavier . all all , it great machine light or moderate exerciser	1

i gave this product 2 stars because assembly mess . however when you eventually get it put together it look pretty good very functional money . it worst assembly directions i ever seen any product . parts not clearly labeled all , you left guessing which screw supposed go where . last step i dont know if parts missing or not but they talking screws when you only 3 screws choose ( , , ) which i said not clearly labeled all you need figure out which screw which letter . i fancy myself fairly handy around house this not easy put together all . very frustrating . if you able decipher instructions , you need stray them if you want put it together , it look pretty good . it hold 2 bags 4 shelves shoes or equipment , but not sure if it would hold extra large pro style bags . not sure if money saved worth hassle putting it together .	-1

i bought this towel two week trip back-packing through france switzerland . towel very absorbant ( including towel-drying my long hair ) dries very fast , maybe hour or so . definitely buy xl if it your primary towel showering , it not very big . it also resists smelling if you pack it away right after showering , i leave it wet my suitcase 2 days it not musty odor when i took it out . it feels kind like paper , but soft , better than some more felt-like material travel towels not absorb well ( like one my boyfriend bought this same trip ) . i recommend this towel any my friends family traveling excurions	1
i doing gentle aerobic exercise twice week now three months hour each time , mostly stationary bike . i could only ten minutes lower body workout this set , without weights . i only five minutes abs workout . i honestly thought i better shape than this . this one dvd separate workouts upper body , lower body , abs , or it also workout combines all three . i torn getting either this or transfirmer set which more than double price this . i decided this since i not sure i would like these workouts although very old set i called firm parts excellent . i decided this because i wanted six inch step years since i remember how effective it firming up my rear thighs when i used take step class . i also could not , after much thought , figure out how slanted step transfimer would any benefit . it seemed like gimmick sell more stuff me . i always buy more dvd if i want use these steps them , without special slanted step . if you've exercising while getting your heart rate up several times week least six months you might able get through entire workout first time . if you over 45 like i am , unless you exceptionaly good condition , you might feel discouraged when you watch this . steps come this nice but they really only lower body , even though they try incorporate them into other routines , like you rest your heels them when you lie your back ab work . i know past experience nothing tone your lower body like step workouts ( except running ) this one pretty good , although they go fast constantly changing up moves , which confusing when you start out . it take me ten sessions until i am able keep up continuous changes they but this normal any step class . this helps keep it too boring . it might least fifteen sessions each workout until i able get through entire workout . time i should looking good though . i intend try tough this out until i get through entire workout . it killer stuff . people addicted firm workouts . they loyal following . i earliest firm vhs tapes i found second hand store . set called firm parts i like it better than this since it more beginner friendly . i also get kick out how they tried make it look sexy , like they when this released early seventies . those girls incredible looking . i've seen if sale ebay . this more intermediate advanced exercisers , them it should perfect . but if you determined sort like me you might able just few minutes time each workout until you good enough shape get through whole thing . time you most definitely see very visable results .	1

i've never pilates , but i yoga , i chose pilates mat because they generally bit thicker , this one because i've good luck hugger mugger brand past , because i like color . yes , some people shop things based color . sue me . anyway , mat great ! i really like extra thickness , because i often joint problems , so some poses get uncomfortable awful quick if using regular-thickness yoga ma t.t he only ' problem ' i it it bit slick . i told my yoga instructor this common pilates mats . yoga mats generally just bit sticky , this one bit , but not near much gripping feel . i also told you use window cleaner or surface cleaner your mat make it bit more sticky . i would recommend not using mrs. meyers clean day surface cleaner . i . it left residue took quite bit rinsing get off . it didn't hurt mat irrevocably , however , so i'm willing bet window cleaner or surface cleaner wouldn't hurt your mat , either . i probably try window cleaner eventually , but only when i time rinse it while if things go awry	1

i used this cap almost daily over year . it still fits snugly very comfortable . writing this review made me think order one now , inevitable day my old one wears out . i rather large head found many caps didn't fit comfortably . this one very elastic great	1
i'm my 5th cap now i think . silicone great lasts forever . unlike rubber ( which snag hair ) latex ( which some people allergic ) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair , glossy finish so it looks great doesn't lose elasticity . i some advice if you want try this product i've learned overt years : 1 . always rinse hang dry . i've left wet caps my gym bag after month two neglect , it develops black spots . i don't know if it mold , it doesn't wash off ... you'll buy new cap if you don't like spotted look . 2 . pull it gently . i've ripped one when i trying stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it . it not cloth so you careful . this goes latex rubber , too . 3 . wet your hair first . if your hair dry when you put it , you trap air under cap . since it not permeable material , cap start come off while you swim because air trying escape inside . 4 . pick fun color . that it . great swim	1

led headlights getting better all time . this little guy one watt luxeon led very good power regulation . regulation means light gets most set batteries keeps light given brightness instead dimming batteries weaken . princeton tec eos three brightness settings flash mode . i actually find flash mode too slow useful bike it flashes full power but these minor nits . i'd also prefer if light used aa instead aaa cells . so i guess there two things i don't like this light . but positives far outweigh negatives . light small supposed waterproof one meter . ( i don't ride under water so i haven't tested feature ! ) it easy operate batteries easy change . light pattern seems just right my riding . i use this light my helmet but it also comes handlebar mount . i run light lowest power setting most time that fine reading my bike computer or cue sheets . middle setting better general riding , spotting road signs potholes things like . highest setting , you get brightest beam but course eats through batteries quicker . i'm pretty sure circuit this light designed willie hunt , real guru bike lighting circles . yes , i'm enough nerd i actually keep track things like . anyhow , princeton tec eos my latest favorite bike toy	1

sporttube met all my expectations . i needed one would hold 2 pairs skis poles , which it beautifully . add wheels easy rolling , best all , fact tube length adjusted so it accommodate whatever length skie one . this especially great , now ski lengths sized so much smaller than past , typical ski bag would over 12 " wasted bag end my 163cm skis . after 2 ski trips it , it shows no damage , appears pretty " bullet-proof " . skitube really consists two pvc/plastic tubes , one slightly smaller diameter than other slide , one inside other . it built-in handle quite long , facilitate easy gripping lifting/pulling . it tsa acceptable closure/lock , also accommodate various keyed or combination locks ( not included ) . skitube comes shoulder strap attached handle , but i found skitube bit cumbersome carry ( although no moreso than regular ski bag ) . optional handle attach end tube facilitate pulling offered option , but i not get this so far , not wanted it either . only drawback skitube , since it rigid , it can't folded up like regular ski bag , so takes up quite bit space . however , dealing storage issue insignificant , compared security , protection , ease transport it offers .	1

i agree above post concering above-par flavors these protein mixes . my favorite banana cream pudding . regarding chocolate fudge pudding ( cfp ) flavor : i am currently using this flavor i would definitely recommend using milk instead water . usually protein mixes you decide whether use milk or water ( except fruit punch-ish flavor i suppose , because would weird .. ) but when i take cfp water it just doesnt seem blend well . i also don't get full " pudding " experience i milk , but i guess that expected . like previous review pointed out , they blend well spoon . stirring insane rate make sure clumps don't develop isn't necessary any bsn protein/mix lines ( syntha-6 , true-mass , ldp )	1

price , this light hard beat . over years , i used approximately twenty different bicycle lights brands such cateye , cygolite planet bike . while some these significantly better than bell , they also three ten times expensive . if you don't mind large mass four aa batteries your handlebars under twenty dollars spend , bell night trail bicycle light way go . real downside batteries enclosure hazard created when housing becomes dislodged during impact . while this not happened bell light , it occur planet bike light while riding through traffic nyc . distraction extremely dangerous . losing half batteries not fun either . fortunately , bell light sturdy enclosure where top half slides backwards open . this makes it almost impervious front vertical impacts . however , internal latches never quite give you clear indication it closed . rather , you must squeeze top downward push forward simultaneously until you can't move it further . much like headlight , taillight compares well more expensive lights . similar competing products , it various blinking modes well always-on setting . due design lens , light escapes sides top light . such side lighting crucial riding urban areas . build quality good but not par $100+ lighting systems . but again , selling point this light overall value . some nicer features include bright xenon bulb paired miserly led lights blink hours . unlike some mr11-based bulbs ( parabolic track lighting bulbs ) , lens assembly two ports right left sides . this spreads light perpendicularly path travel , which nice feature when traffic . these features combined very modest price make this light excellent choice budget conscious . prosvaluebrightnesscombination led xenon modesdecent build qualityside lighting headlightconsquestionable design battery compartment ( top half headlight)bulkyleds could brighter	1

previous review absolultely correct weights . if you don't weights legs stand it , fact fly your basement . i'd also recommend double-ended bag ( i.e. , d-ring bottom bag ) . it decreases bag-sway . i'm just using 2 bungee cords tie it down stand but seems work out pretty well ( instead proper shock cord ) . very helpful practicing kicks . top weights , i've also added 2 40-lb bags water-softening salt front-legs even more stability . there nothing special kind salt , i just happened them around . it looks little rube goldberg , but price i'm willing live i t.t he speed-bag stand nice . loud , but nice .	1

we ordered these skates my 5 year old daughter , who discovered roller skating . these skates great kids who just starting , well kids who mastered balance but still learning basics . we let her use them rink setting , but i believe they would ok regular outdoor use also . wheels not turn freely , so she skate not all over place . i don't know if they adjusted allow easier turning future . make skate very well , seems very sturdy product . we ordered 1 1/2 sizes too big give her growing room , pair thicker socks , she no problems ! very reasonably priced , especially since her feet growing won't this size great length time ~	1
i'm runner my schedule forces me run mostly night work days . large part my nightly run unlighted streets . i needed light see help seen . i tried carrying small flashlight but found it pain .... wrist ! i run hot never wear hat winter , even though i live montana , so i hesitant try it due increased sweat factor potential fogging up my glasses . i got one christmas gift . ( if i hated it , i wouldn't out bucks ! ) it wonderful ! it so light i don't notice it there . stap quite adjustable so person make it tight or loose one wants . it easily adjusted bare head , over hat or even over bike helmet . unlike many other brands , this light also adjustable up down . 3 different light level settings each hyperbright superbright led make it quite adaptable different needs . i've found hyperbright medium setting works best me even remote unlighted areas . colored light battery life indicator ensures i don't run out power middle run or change batteries prematurely . ability see avoid road hazards greatly improves enjoyment my night runs . when i first started using it , i planned switching light off lighted streets extend battery life . i soon discovered number cars ( inadvertently or not)swerving me decreasing tremendously well number courteous drivers moving over safer distance increasing when i kept light lighted areas . i highly recommend zenix iq ! cons : on/off button impossible me use when wearing gloves . just like any other battery powered device i've ever owned , batteries don't last nearly long owner manual suggests . low temperatures really zap battery life but expected . luckily , aa batteries inexpensive	1

gerber folding shovel really top notch . its quality construction much like any other gerber/fiskars equipment i've owned - it doesn't disappoin t.t he shovel i actually little more agressively pointed than pictures , so i'm not sure if gerber addressed this issue or if pictures off . top handle high density polycarbonate plastic horizontal design like spade should . you still use verticle part steel handle if you wish , but there isn't much it . plastic absorb some shock compared steel-only , it won't freeze your hands , etc . polycarb handle folds down itself , so it actually 3 segments ( instead several designs which 2 segments ) . this means you stow shovel included cordura nylon belt pouch which no bigger than shovel head itself . handle pivot point locks since it square , doesn't rotate or twist easily . steel which connects blade handle fits nicely inside angle cutout handle , so when collapsed it really thin . blade high quality steel hinged handle connected top . this limit depth shovel little , but i don't believe it much factor , except maybe really solid soil where you lose little verticle travel when ground butts up against hinge . it very compact , light , comes solid belt sheath ( easily convertible pack carry ) stows away easily since it so thin . i put it side pockets my doors or very small space above my rear wheel well without any problems ( trailblazer 4x4 ) . i really find no fault this item , it delivers all fronts : usability , quality , compact storage , rugged design . i almost certainly keeping one both cars my 72 hour survival kit . they even reasonably priced . 5 stars	1

this product needs some work . buttons too close together ( no , i don't fat fingers ) - it very easy push wrong one . which might just take you into complex menu that not easy get out ! pixels display ridiculously large - i purposefully blur my eyes decipher numbers . it kind seems like someone invention prototype they fashioned their garage . stitching partially unraveled ( this what " stitching may vary " means ? it wasn't colored stitching .... ) velcro strap used hold thumb sensor . yet i still optimistic ! i glued velcro strap , got used buttons display , i actually loved it first dozen uses or so . then it stopped working ... every time main part ( wraps around your hand ) moved even minutest way , unit would somehow reset itself , display boldly announcing product name then informing me all its stored information reset . i so sad ! so much so , i bought one , thinking i'd just ended up dud . but 2nd one also stopped working after only few uses . it just suddenly displayed 3 vertical lines , wouldn't turn off . only thing ever worked well this thing actual heart rate sensor , which i found quite accurate . luckily , amazon giving me full refund both , one which bit past their 30 day limit . thank you amazon ! i'm going try mark fitness one . it looks like actual company made it instead some incompetent electrical engineer wannabe .	-1

i'm my 5th cap now i think . silicone great lasts forever . unlike rubber ( which snag hair ) latex ( which some people allergic ) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair , glossy finish so it looks great doesn't lose elasticity . i some advice if you want try this product i've learned overt years : 1 . always rinse hang dry . i've left wet caps my gym bag after month two neglect , it develops black spots . i don't know if it mold , it doesn't wash off ... you'll buy new cap if you don't like spotted look . 2 . pull it gently . i've ripped one when i trying stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it . it not cloth so you careful . this goes latex rubber , too . 3 . wet your hair first . if your hair dry when you put it , you trap air under cap . since it not permeable material , cap start come off while you swim because air trying escape inside . 4 . pick fun color . that it . great swim	1

i got my first vector three years ago , rei . yes , it large . not problem me i am large . i am my third vector ; first two , some strange reason , leaked water , first during incredible monsoon rainstorm mountains arizona , second while taking shower . no , i not submerse watch , nor push any buttons while water ' ' . fortunately , rei accepts returns no questions . it testament how nice this watch i continued replace watch . perhaps i models bad production run , my present vector lasted over two years nary leak . good : i found digital compass very accurate useful . remember it must calibrated time time , don't forget declination . barometer very useful . barometer function constantly operating , accounts nice little symbol upper left display showing pressure trends over past few hours . this very useful if you understand barometric pressure trends their likely results . if you not , look it up learn , you find it very useful if you spend lot time brush . remember barometric pressure must calibrated against absolute sea-level readings time time , especially during rapidly changing weather conditions . once you understand relationship altitude/changing weather , you master complexities both barometer altimeter , understand just how simple they , how reliable this device really . i checked it against my high-end gps other barometers many times , it very accurate indeed . temp useful if you need know temperature ; like all such devices , it taken off your body ten minutes before you get accurate reading . bad : lens plastic . if you any experience fine coated-glass , you fine this : not , ever , wipe any dust or dirt off face . use lens-pen , fine blower-brush . or wait until you've stepped under water it . put simply , it my experience if you keep your grubby paws off it , don't try ' clean ' it your cotton t-shirt/flannel shirt/etc , instead use methods used fine coated glass elements , it look like new forever . mine , it desert dust swamp mud . battery , fact , eventually lose energy ! normal use , you expect year or more battery . if you one those fellas shows everyone he meets his " neat digital compass " , or actually rely this your primary compass brush , it won't last nearly so long . digital compass primary energy-sucker , likely much backlight . use compass only when needed ( you should base-plate compass anyway ... suunto also makes some best these well ) . review stating watchbands give out , i find remarkable i never problem mine , i wear it constantly , day day out . all all , spite fact i return my first two , i heartily recommend vector . tough useful	1

i my homework investigated various brands models spinners person . i went schwinn ic elite because , time purchase , it sold less money than model below it , ic pro . i originally planned purchase ic pro but made no sense when better model cheaper . i wanted gym quality spinner i planned ride regularly would not need ever replace . i read many reviews amazon talked equipment good starter equipment if buyer actually wound up using it , they'd upgrade later . that not my style . if i'm buing it , i'm using it ! ic pro ic elite both built last lifetime . i didn't order schwinn because i would incurred additional charge delivery installation , mandatory , plus hefty new york sales tax . i ordered directly schwinn , who send nautilus representative bike put it together , trials tribulations followed would probably avoided . first , amazon sent wrong bike . they sent ic pro instead ic elite . i request replacement pick-up incorrect bike . i tip delivery people help me get very heavy/sturdy bike back into box return shipping . correct bike came week or two later . bike comes mostly assembled i no problem putting it together . it really just requires putting stability bars pedals . unfortunately , when i got bike , which supposed gym quality , it provided terrible ride . wheel seemed wobble , it noisy there some sort grinding going which made whole bike vibrate . i requested serviceman come out fix it . customer service people nice , but somehow service order didn't make it through service department few weeks . i finally got serviceman out he said wheel it assembly would replaced . wheel gets assembled china this particular job faulty . he ordered new wheel shipped me ten days went until serviceman could return replace wheel . we opened box replacement wheel found schwinn sent wrong wheel ! again they sent ic pro instead elite . new wheel ordered , couple weeks get service . wheel replacement trick bike rides like dream . i am now totally happy my spinner . four stars instead five because it took couple months get happy my purchase . i purchased it april 5 . today june 16 , red letter day bike finally works well . me cost savings purchasing through amazon worth couple months inconvenience . i might felt differently if it winter when i'd rather stay home ride than go out gym .	1

this disc certainly best i played . it rim lower than those made frisbee , which gives disc much nicer feel . it flies well , material also good : not super-soft or thin , so it doesn't warp easily , but soft enough it won't hurt your hands when catching fast throw . i recommend it all players , but especially those more experienced ultimate players	1

this my favorite carry flashlight , it hardly takes up any room no matter what pocket you put it . high setting it lights up broad area few lights any size match , i large collection luxeon-based lights up 5 watts one k2 . k2-based light runs two cr123 batteries tends get hot , which fenix doesn't . since it runs one battery it easy tuck battery away case you really need lot light long time . strobe very impressive , looks like it projecting 135+ watts . sos little slow , but it usable . when you get good twisting it on/off you one-hand it without lot fuss setting it minor twist . if this portent future , i can't wait see what other cree-based offerings come other manufacturers . highly recommended	1
works very well . long lasting . not warm i hoped	1

i ordered this backpack temporary solution . i thought it cheap ($20 item , around $10 shipping ) , but now i realize it isn't . maybe i start negative aspect product : too simple , only one big one small compartments , small one front pocket . addition , straps small . i am big , but i see many larger people than me around honest if you aroun xl or xxl size it would quite uneasy put backpack over jacket its straps simply too shor t.t he good part : it looks durable , business , now i keep it spare since i now one(not jansport :) but sill , price somehow appears alittle too much me . same amount i gave i could find real nice adidas or nike ( original ones :) back my country	1

took this brand new pack 3 night , 4 day trip through sierras . i my sleeping bag bed roll straped bottom tent wedged front panel pack itself . this pack big enough carry all gear i needed 4 days . trails major climbs up down trails carved into granite . my pack weight 40lbs . pack held together great . extra lashing points front panel handy when used carabiners small items such water shoes , flashlight , sierra cup . my only real gripe two side mesh pockets . they rendered useless because bottom adjustment/cinch straps outside mesh pockets only thing you get there flat map . what i ended up doing cutting two slits each pocket passed adjustment straps through slits inside pockets . gave me use pockets back . addition , mesh pockets little no elasticity . full pack , it still tough getting item such sierra cup mesh pockets impossible get 32oz water bottle there . anyway , money this pack good deal . i thought sure this pack would've shreds after trip . well , after inspecting it after trip , no rips , no bad seams , nothing torn or broken .	1

my first kershaw knife . but not my last . fact , my second kershaw already ordered . blown away quality this product . extremely smooth operation . outstanding fit finish . sharpest knife , right out box , i ever purchased . sweet	1
even though it relatively inexpensive pocket-knife , i poured over reviews , compared more trendy benchmade , spyderco , kershaw knives , went over every option swiss-army . why not more expensive knives ? because i wanted compact knife more than one blade . i also wanted more options than they offer . yes , i'd lot cooler carrying lastest spyderco or benchmade - but i'm practicality . i little concerned how well it would hold edge . more expensive knives stronger , denser , carbon-based steel , but it comes cost . they're little more prone rust . i read up victorinox , although it might slightly softer metal , it virtually impervious rust . it compact folding knife multiple blades i plan using outdoors quite bit , this concern . so far , i've used it quite bit it remains super-sharp day it arrived course , absolutely no rust , stains , or discoloration . i chose harvester over other swiss army knives following reasons . i wanted silver metal exterior texture , not slick red plastic tends scratch . silver also makes me feel like it more durable looks much more expensive . small pruning blade - i use this one most often . hook shaped point this blade makes opening anything very simple . saw - wow . teeth extremely sharp arranged such way they rip thru wood . i tested it scrap piece 1/2 " plywood even though you only make small strokes , it wouldn't take long saw thru decent size limb . awl perfect scratching starter hole nails drill bits . overall size knife not too small not too large . you barely notice it your pocket . overall build quality excellent . you feel like you're getting more than your money worth . only feature i sort miss lanyard attachment . it available other knives , but it tradeoff size options important me . that my review . i use heck out thing am extremely happy it . you too	1
i hoping more around wrist type lanyard but this around neck clasp not my use . i needed it use carrying around usb flash memory , but clasps where large fit into holes made smaller clasps . i would say these still nice gym teachers ref out there need them whistles	1
i'm only 5 ft 9 inches but i always seem fall off edges mat during classes . this mat really keeps my attention class instead repositioning so much . extra thickness great - i see other people doubling their mats get extra cushiness	1
overall , i think this good product just what it promises ... helps you easily spool line onto your fishing reels under appropriate tension . this keep your line tight reel , maximizing amount line it hold preventing line digging into spool under load fish . i would point out instructions attached bottom unit lacking when it comes spinning reels not mention or illustrate you ( should ) rotate spool holder bracket 90 degrees so your spool facing sideways your reel . you also should flip spool line bracket if it looks like line coming off twisted instead loading smoothly . most good fishing lines come instructions explain this process specific spinning reels . battery-powered line stripper worked fine me heavier trolling line ( 30-50lb . ) , but i haven't used it thinner lines yet . instructions product descriptions not mention it , but my model , line stripper also revolving sharpening stone protruding end honing hooks -- nice added bonus ! this exact stripper sold separately amazon.com under name " berkley pocket line stripper/hook honer " -- look it up closeup photo more details . package i received came two spare orange rubber wheels line stripper , but it also came two black rubber grommets spooling bracket not depicted or used anywhere instructions , illustrations , or this unit ... they removed insert bracket into base . not sure what up . lastly , everything breaks down stores together so it hung wall until needed . set up takes only seconds	1

like other reviewers , i also posted this review identical product sold directly amazon - which where i purchased it . let me start out saying this rower not perfect . it , fact , flawed . you may noticed , i still gave it five star rating i try explain reasons doing so . reading reviews here , i noticed two complaints : one pointing out this machine doesn't perform same standards professional gym rowers other regarding assembly this machine . i researched various rowers available market quite while . i spent lot time effort driving around trying various models before purchasing this one simply because i tend informed shopper who wants get value his money . during my research , it became very evident my favorite rower water rower followed schwinn windrigger - both extremely smooth their operation . both also $1000 ! any rate , these sophisticated rowers gave me benchmark against which compare integrity it should surprise nobody integrity doesn't really come close performance either other two rowers . it shouldn't , given it substantially lower price . this exactly what it important considering this rower : you cannot expect get professional-grade rower such low price just like you cannot expect get comfort performance rolls royce if you buying honda . nonetheless , what you get integrity well within parameters what i would expect $200 . machine reasonably stable , it reasonably smooth , it provide great workout . noise level also not too bad actually seems less than windrigger . electric monitor basic provides speed , time , calories burned , distance . it also provides option continuously cycles through all these functions so you cant track all them during your workout . seat comfortable slides smoothly track whole thing actually pretty professional look it doesn't appear flimsy . i also quite surprised level resistance this rower provides - it much more than schwinn windrigger . addition , resistance adjusted pretty easily . i think my only disappointment air-flow created during operation not channeled toward person using machine aid cooling him/her down - but this certainly flaw i live . potential buyer you should also aware rower tends slide across smooth surfaces such tile - which means you need non-slip mat under it if you intend use it such surface . i said before , i also read least one person problem assembling this rower . i cannot confirm this problem . assembly extremely easy quick - even though instructions not greatest . however , it should quite clear most people where parts go what needs hooked up where . winding up chain onto gear wheel breeze , too . all you need unhook it retracting cord you hooked it up one or two steps before . i suppose person who wrote instructions could switched these steps make it more logical - but i said , instructions not great . taking all these factors into account , i think integrity provides fantastic product very low price . it exactly what it supposed it so surprisingly good manner . however , any product , your expectations should realistic if they , you not disappointed . if you expect gym-quality machine - you not get what you looking . if , however , you looking basic functional rower without all bells whistles high-end products , then this probably best deal you get	1
i never ordered something like this web before , but after reading positive reviews here decided it . i could not find rower town less than $800 . this rower sweet arrived idaho east coast 6 days after i ordered it ( amazon ) . it easy enough assemble works great . i am middle aged woman , weighing around 175 ( under max . rower limit 250 ) feel safe comfortable when i'm rowing . also , seat cushioned it glides easily track . i not find it loud all kind like cool swishes air when i'm rowing . you won't sorry ordering one these i think it way more fun way get shape ! get one .	1

yoga mats come three basic thicknesses newer fourth thickness becoming increasingly available . 1/4 inch , this mat one latter kind tops even " thick " mats ( 3/16 " thick ) designed those who need or want extra cushion . it exactly two times thicker than average mat . 24 " 68 " it also standard width length . mats one fourth thick this one ( 1/16 " ) good travel or placing under thicker mat provide more traction . average mats 1/8 . " there two sides this nearly all yoga mats . look carefully ' bumps ' each side mat . larger bumps designed face upwards cushion your hands , feet , knees during poses while keeping your body dangerously slipping out alignment . smaller bumps designed face downwards grip floor keep yoga mat sliding . many mats label one end name brand . this typically , but not always , located ' up ' side . bumps tell you sure . this yoga mat increase softness stickiness use . ( so most mats . ) they start out mildly sticky increase stickiness more they used . you want wash your mat when it first arrives so remove thin film they get their surface during manufacturing process . instructions washing mat included . once you've washed dried your mat you're ready begin ! after using it while , if you find mat decreasing stickiness each time you pull it out , this typical sign light coating dust or too much body sweat accumulated your mat it needs light hand washing very diluted soap water . after washing , roll your mat thick towel squeeze out excess water , otherwise it take forever dry air . then , air dry your mat unrolled , inside , away sunlight . ( hanging over shower bar works nicely . ) when you first unroll your mat you find one end bit curled . simply alternate direction you roll your mat ( top outside once , then bottom outside next ) or end you start ( curled end once , flat end next time ) you'll find it straightening out more or less over time . i recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them you . i've worked many studios gyms over years . sometimes management mats cleaned often , sometimes not . if you bring your own mat you always know where it . :o ) plus , owning your own mat may encourage you begin valuable practice home . my students who trouble their knees some poses requiring body weight rest knee , i recommend temporarily folding over one end mat get double cushion under knee while still leaving one layer under rest body . this saves you haul more than one mat out each time you practice which discouraging especially beginner .	1

" however , someone intent criminal act just might notice , avoid me altogether . great knife personal safety . lastly , like other reviews point out , these knives sharp . i don't use mine open letters , boxes typical pocket knife activities ( i believe would gum it up , slow opening speed knife ) , so i anticipate blade should good , long life my care .	1

my husband bought me this bike my birthday . we really searched best bike , thanks other reviews we bought this bike . this bike accomodates me 5'9 " , my husband 6'3 " no problem . it very quiet . although mine developed small squeal , it still not even loud enough me really care or call advice . i gave this bike 4 stars because computer comes off little too easily . i many small children they take it apart lot . nothing little sticky tape cant fix . my mother law bought bike two thousand dollars ours almost identical ( hers not develop small squeal obviously ) . even programming choices same . mine little lower floor also ( those you kids house appreciate lower profile-your kids shorter distance fall off when they climbing it ) . good deal money- feels solid well built , yet i move it one room easily(when so inclined ) thanks " rolling endcaps " frame . aslo easy move vacuuming	1
faithful readers may read review my previous dealings rower brand . i using this rower few weeks now i am very pleased . other reviewers noticed , magnetic resistance very quiet . i sometimes get rattling seat , but not much . okay , unlike other machines , max weight limit this machine 350 pounds ( not 250 ) . lcd display great my dim basement , heart rate feature heat ! i waited try feature before i wrote this review . it compatible my polar heart rate monitor existing chest strap(one supplied anyway ) . pulse program useful it raises resistance raise your heart beat preset target also reduces resistance lower your heart rate target rate . there even pulse recovery feature when you stop rowing . it monitors how quickly your heart rate recovers minute displays your score 1-6 nearest tenth . preset programs options varied enough prevent boredom . if there any drawback , it way operator manual needs couple readings get meaning across . fact , i basically tell you more pulse recovery feature than they manual . barring , i able assemble rower myself one session using tools came it . overall , very satisfactory balance price features . ** update ** 16 march 2007 : i part break seat . i called customer service not only spoke human , but human states ! part it way day . now what i call positive experience	1
though once this piece excercise equipment built , it everything advertisements , print infomercial , declare . however , somewhere , i swear , i read it takes only 45 minutes put together just taking parts 5 large boxes took well over hour . further , actual installation took over two days ; i'd like think my buddy myself pretty good these things . however , i said , once put together , this one solid , helpful piece excercise equipment . one more thing , sure you space it once assembled . it really large piece equipment , both vertically horizontally . good luck	1
we bought disney minnie mouse trike our daughters 2nd birthday her eyes just lit up when she saw it . eventhough she can't quite pedal bike her own just yet she loves ride it us pushing her . we going get pedal blocks make it easier her learn pedal . i would highly recommend this trike any little girl	1
intone jogger exactly what i looking , hopefully help get my ankles shape , rest me . i read other reviews , really expected difficult time getting it put together . my husband i got it all less than 15 minutes . it great ! i've looked local stores , can't find joggers like this . when i find this , shipping free , it much better deal than i could find anywhere else	1
it required strong man assemble it . stability bar great ! video much needed addition because it hard find something trampoline . it really supports suggested weight . i think price little high considering it doesnt fold	1
exactly what i wanted described . it bit harder put together thani would liked , but once , it works fine	1
i'm 33 , but kid heart . this great purchase . easy learn lots fun . i ordered size bigger than my regular shoe size it fits perfectly	1
we gave this trike our son his third birthday . he pretty tall , but he no problems reaching pedals . took bit put it together , but that case any new trike/bike product seat kept wanting slide down , even after tightening . eventually , my husband got seat stay . if your child over 3 feet tall , you should able adjust seat enough get his/her legs pedals .	1
i 2 3.5 year old they both love this toy- i'm ordering one because they fight over it . we put it sandbox it easy them control they literally spent hours playing it	1

this kayak great kayaking shallow streams . firstly , it very light . i carry it comfortably moderate distances over dry land . this allows me avoid various obstacles water ; just run ashore , pick boat up carry it past obstacle . fallen logs arent problem any more ! secondly , it very durable . ive using kayak year now absolutly no problems . there extremely durable outer shell made nylon which protects part boat actually inflates ; this prevents any kind sharp bushes or protruding brances puncturing anything vital . bottom coated rubber which yet show any defect . rubber realy helps shallow water , or even no water , rocks dirt puncturing inner tubing . thirdly , probably most importantly , it sinks into water only little bit . paddling 5-6 inch deep water isnt problem it most boats , including inflatable sit kayaks . boat also alot fun ocean , much moreso than standard ocean kayaks . this mostly because you cant hurt yourself kayak run into you , or flip over you . playing waves really enjoyable . boat comes mesh bag draw string backpack straps . this good idea ; mesh allows water drain out after boat packed away backpack straps suprisingly comfortable . there some problems boat . maximum wieght may 250 pounds kayak , but this pretty unrealistic . 150 pounds i sit comfortably kayak without there significant bending problem , where middle boat wants sink lower than ends . 200 pounds bending problem comes rather obnoxious because water collects right where youre sitting . you get wet using kayak if youre over 150 pounds , or inexperienced paddler . there some tracking problems eliminated using skegs . skegs , course , make boats clearance much more nuisance . tracking issue isnt issue experienced paddlers , but if you want your inexperienced friend take kayak whirl , he'll spin circles hour before getting hang it . inflating kayak very easy adn takes 5 minutes . deflating kayak bit trickier , taking 10 minutes . buying sevylor pump both pumping vacuum function reduces time needed deflation	1
this set great cost-benefit ratio . clubs perform well also look good . only drawback bag not come travel cover , neither it support keep it standing while playing . overall evaluation very good though	1
i love this water bottle . it perfect me . i love no leak feature straw seems hold up under lots biting . wish it little smaller bottom so it would fit into my car holder better . no complaints so far .	1
my family absolutely loves this machine . it tons different styles workouts . i've long history running , this thing gets my heart rate going gets me huffing puffing . only complaint i , it squeaks . we've tried lot different things stop squeaking , some days it doesn't squeak , others it .	1
i hit lot " almost golf balls " which hard foam rubber practice balls , my back yard . i gone through hundreds wooden tees which made my back yard look like driving range . these tees solved problem . now i 2 or 3 tees out there they last forever . great solution my particular situation	1
this bottle little pricy . but it what it claims . it preserves hot water temperature very well . i didn't try cold temperature . construction very solid high impact resistent ( good portability ) . i no doubt it last many many years . all , i am happy quality this bottle . but , i take 1 star out due its premium price	1
it doesn't weigh ten pounds , like some claiming . it weighs 4 most , i'd say . quite difficult hold one-handed though , * really * difficult resheathe it without propping sheath up or something . it really doesn't much edge all , contradiction what i've reading other reviews . particular sword i received amazingly good condition . blade nearly pristine . it straight arrow . sheath fits snugly , but misaligned bit takes some work get tang into it . there no rattle when you swing it ; it feels nicely solid . this sword astounding value , all all . 68 " just doesn't really register until you're standing next it . materials nice , workmanship excellent , packing job zealous say least	1
if your like me you probably waiting someone make this 10 years . so when i found it here , i really no choice but buy it . first all i need remind you this sword 68 " long . if your not sure how big , get measuring tape out see . you might find out it bigger than you . also sure you spot hang it . shipping pretty quick . it delivered ups it came day early . shipping also $22 . when i opened it i surprised find there some detail put into handle like some people looke like samurai some weird looking animals . i also surprised blade actually sharp edge it , i expecting it just big chunk carbon steel . it pretty cool look yourself mirror holding something you idealized since you kid , swing it hear nice wind sound . although you won't able swing it many times , because it weighs 10 pounds . now , few things i didn't like it , which probably what you want hear . first they put this vasoline type gel it keep it rusting , which i understand when you buy carbon steel sword , but i just can't get stuff off . everytime i put it back into its holder more gets . also there looks like something resembles waterspots it . i guess i got polish it . second thing i didn't like made china carved into blade . third , theres little glue running down where hand guard . all all , this great sword . especially if your final fantasy nut like me also sword nut too . something so rare collection $99 why not get it . i'm also going add , even thou i shouldn't , this sword not used . i know your probably saying " " right now me . but when your holding it your hand your probably going get urge hit something . i'm just going tell you physics going against you , because how long thin blade . although i think it pretty cool watch sword fight , so if you decided record it post it . thanks reading	1
my 6 10 year old boys use this backstop regularly . they put batting-t front hit hard balls into net , then use it behind them ball-catch hitting pitches(sponge balls . ) it red square strike zone helps pitcher find strike zone , when facing net , provides target hitter . it pops open great force so carefull when you set it up first time . my 10 yr . old folds it puts it away us . this quality product essential piece training equipment any age . we like jugs machine balls use backyard . they dense yellow sponge correct size , weight seam . unlike regular training balls , we not broken window them yet .	1

when i bought this product it because i wanted way work out home but i not enough money buy expensive tredmill or eliptical thought this cheaper alternative . i worried because i read lot online reviews stated it very hard put together but i not find case i just dont think people realize it takes 30 45 miniutes assemble but directions easy understand i got it together out any major problems . i also read reveiws states machine very squeeky which it times me but if you just spray some dw 40 it little seems solve problem . i orginally wanted use machine while watching tv but i usually dont feel like i am getting much workout . my machine came dvd ( i bought mine hsn ) when i follow those i feel like i get much better workout . its good watch them least see all diffrent execrcises you this product . machine fold up but it not something should considered very portable . i thought i would able keep it closet take it out every day but it just hard . i am happy i bought this product it easy it very low impact . i would recommed it others .	1

this reasonable light certainly good job making you visible motorists . i would agree reviewer brightness - it not really bright enough use only source illumination . me most disappointing factor ' no tools ' fitting strap . it grips poorly glossy surfaces - like many handlebars , example ! i ended up gluing rubber patches inside strap improve this . worse , strap tensioner actually broke apart after just over year use . pivot pins just not up rest build quality . pros- good light sodium lit city streets- really waterproof- solid casecons- ' no tools ' strap simply sucks . - you'll need light if it genuinely dark where you ride . not really worth investment . i bought cheaper 5-led light - proper screwdriver tightened quick release fixing - i am far happier . cateye now expensive spare flashlight .	-1

i bought this my son 4th birthday . he everyone else love it ! his legs short i thought he still needed trike . he absolutely loves tow hook back . it extremely well made tow package very strong sturdy . seat multiple positions plenty growing room . my 6 1/2 year old loves it too . they both hook things up tow them around . this far cutest trike out there i would definitly reccommend it . it slightly confusing put together , but once i got things figured out it easy . instructions just aren't thorough enough , but it just basically common sense anyway . this wouldn't keep me getting it . just thought i should totally honest it .	1
we ordered this trampoline our four year old christmas present . it best $30-$40 we've ever spent . she very energetic jumping seems calm her . even middle meal or conversatin , she start jumping . small trampoline fits our living room right family room area dining area , so she plenty opportunities jump . this bit stiffer not much bounce outdoor trampolines , but if it bouncy , it would more dangerous four year old , it would sag floor , since it isn't high off ground . it low floor , not super bouncy so i don't any safety concerns it . now , if i could just motivate myself exercise it , it would even more find .	1

i purchased this sale , so made this extra good value . , amazon ships this fast -- it took 3 or 4 days receive . it very easy put together . i wanted this before my husband came home , so i add rubber mat flooring put this together , which i able . only part i needed help stretching gray resistance band getting pulley bolt , since it difficult hold band lessen resistance screw bolt same time . it really pretty easy instructions surprisingly well-written . you must measure bolts since they close size . machine great price . only thing makes this difficult machine use how resistance altered . part very poorly designed i keep meaning go hardware store find alternative hook or clip use . way leg attachment cables need changed enough make you want choose some other exercise over leg extensions ! however , if i find some clips similar what bowflex uses its resistance machines ( they built totally differently -- but i like their clips/hooks ) , i think changing resistance much more pleasant definitely easier . machine enables you very many exercises . leg curls great , preacher/machine curl attachment wonderful . you even leg presses this machine , believe it or not , but only 130 pounds . still , that great me ! lat bar gets lot use that easy adjust . all resistance upper body much easier adjust than leg attachment exercises . still , they aren't easy pulling clip reinserting it . benefit here bench itself . it adjustable many positions ( no decline ) , when upper part removed , you use machine rowing machine . , i've tried many rowing machines , this one very smooth almost fun use . all all , this great value , but not user friendly it should . my husband i love it since we now don't wait eachother equipment when we similar workouts working timer , since we already other equipment . so , we extra bench now , extra upper lower pulley station now , it makes working out together much more fun	1

6 time marathon runner triathlete i tried more than my share gels substances carb replacement . my running group favor clif blocks number reasons . 1 ) they taste great not too sweet . over course long event you can't stomach more gel after while --- these seem go down ok hours into event . 2 ) they carry well don't cause mess like gels . even gel flasks leak , but no problem here . 3 ) you vary your intake ( one cube every 10min or 2 every 20 or 3 every 30 or 40 ) . you also get them down without water . yeah , little pricey but well worth it if you serious doing outdoors thing	1
this elliptical great , i able put it together 1-2 hours . i've it 2 weeks so far works like charm . only reason i give it 4 stars every time i turn console it makes loud beep ( design ) , which problem because i usually workout late night , when kids asleep ( loud noises sometimes wake kids up ) . there mute option , but it only works after console turned . other than ( which really minor annoyance ) this machine great	1

i like smaller size watch . this particular monitor gives summary each workout session . directions made it easy set up read watch face . i mainly am interested keeping eye calories burned i give myself targets hit when i ride my bike . however there one annoying part this watch - wrist band . it easy strap but not easy take off . buckle not open easily too take watch off . i hold down middle metal piece locks into wrist band holes play strap moving it up down until i am able take watch off . i strap watch loosely or it very hard unbuckle if i make wrist band fit properly . i didn't this problem my previous men polar wrist band . wrist band feels like stiffer plastic/rubber piece then my prior polar band too .	1

i am soldier who recently returned deployment . while i deployed i injured both knees am unalbe run due impact . i tried ellipticals while i deployed quite impressed work out i got . when i returned i went out started searching one my own . my goal keep it under $1000 . i tried many different brands discovered not all ellipticals created equal . many them cheaply made shake side side or make alot noise . stride very important . i am 6 foot tall 16 inch stride some them just didnt cut it . i ended up buying proform 160 proform website since it 18 inch stride seemed sturdy , however , after discovering how little they care customer service , i cancelled my order . i ended up buying image 9.5 walmart . i used it 3 weeks came conclusion foot pedals spaced too far apart it put pressure my knees made my hips hurt . after thinking it minute it made sense me , who runs thier feet far apart anyway . my feet almost land straight line when i run . so i set out find one closer pedals . overall i tried almost 2 dozen different machines finally found schwinn 430 fitness store . i tried 418 438 also , but 430 seemed most comfortable me . 438 some other brands seem high arch upstroke . 430 very smooth ultra quiet . it very well made should last many years . amazon best deal it it me 8 days . it very comfortable machine . after all this i would say anyone wanting buy elliptical , try alot them , i tried all ones sears , oshmans , academy fitness motion . make sure stride length , pedal angle pedal spacing comfortable you , after all , if its not comfortable you wont want use it . only thing i think could improved schwinn 430 backlit display . luckily i work out lights so its not problem , haha . i tried many machines $2-3000 this one still more comfortable me . it heavy machine , so get help carrying it , but you glad its heavy when you ride it . it some assembly required , but it fairly clear instructions , so there shouldnt problem assembly . happy hunting	1

i bought used rower years ago came work it several times week . i'm busy person , so i don't time sophisticated work out routine . i just want work one machine both strength aerobic training . rowing great this purpose . when i broke my rower , i started shopping . unfortunately , even used rowers over $100 . i struggled this model versus smaller ones stand up vertically easy storage . i couldn't find any reviews this addressed storage question . finally , i chose it because it didn't look like i could break it normal usage , whereas kind fold nicely seem flimsy . pros : - this machine very sturdy . it solid , stable , not rock all when use . - it amazingly quiet . only sound whisper pistons . i use it tv normal volume . - seat very comfortable . i sat it 30 minutes first time no discomfort . cons : - it not fold , collapse , or stand up vertically . it just sits floor . it would very awkward try store it under bed . don't lift back end too far or plug timer bend . this why it only 4 stars . - front bumper pads just stuck . you can't drag it backwards without them popping off . back ones also just sit there , but they face sideways , so they won't come off . - instructions difficult . my wife i kept flipping back forth manual figure out which bolt each step direction referred . work out great . i really like using this machine . i only wish i better place put it when i'm not using it	1

i initially tried order my kettler kadett company called mercantila , a.k.a. rowingmachines.com . it complete disaster nightmare including some false advertising , trying cover up some mistakes their part which caused month delays , some horrible customer service ( or lack thereof ) , some false charges , lot headaches . eventually enough enough i wound up ordering it directly amazon , which cost me few bucks more , but well worth it . machine comes mostly disassembled took hour half put together . there few confusing moments instructions only pictures no text , so making sure you right part takes little extra focus . it came all tools necessary except allen wrench which necessary one small thing . terms overall quality , it very high . i'm not concerned this thing breaking , nor it rattle or ill-fitting parts . said , housing computer little wimpy doesn't attach very securely main body i've knocked it off couple times . small piece tape base kept it firmly locked into place since . some people complained location straps foot plates . i actually find their location ideal , although they tend loosen themselves during workout . i made trip down store bought some velcro which i sewed onto straps . it took 15 minutes i now best foot straps world . best thing this machine , reason i bought it , it really fact mimic actual rowing motion . when i close my eyes i actually believe i'm boat water which makes my workouts much more pleasant . so anyone any doubts , you fact believe hype , it like rowing boat . additionally , all action very smooth . seat very sturdy comfortable it doesn't wobble . arms also smooth grips spin freely . one other reason i bought this machine i'm very tall kadett adjusts accommodate my size . it this placing footboards center beam slides inside central housing . this beam adjusted allowing my incredibly long logs get full complete extension without seat hitting end it track . although it takes up lot space during use due outrigger style " oars " , it fold up size traditional hydraulic rowing machine 30 seconds . i keep mine leaned up against wall out way adjacent room , it not very heavy it isn't big deal pulling it out every morning . one problem i discover , numbers one my adjustable hydraulic pistons misaligned . so it minor nuisance set resistance initially i it feel . preview , kadette appears overpriced compared virtually all other hydraulic rowing machines . but it really completely different kind animal terms rowing action makes it worth price tag . it still suffers slow start pistons come up temperature like any other hydraulic rowing machine , but rowing motion like heaven .	1

hi ! i'll try make this short , sweet , point . why i bought iti like workout 4-5 days week , but i live la it sometimes hard get gym if i work late or if there traffic . also , my neighborhood not so nice , so i prefer avoid jogging night . enter fitness quest integrity 3000 air rower . assemblyif you assemble ikea furniture or coffee table walmart , then you assemble rower . you put 4 pins , then hook strap rower bungie cord under seat . finito . far tools go ( despite what instructions say ) all you need two wrenches . use socket wrench ( $10 target or walmart ) you'll even faster . qualitythe rower surprisingly good quality price . it made two piece aluminum frame feels sturdy . first , i little skeptical chain connecting rower handle , because it looks really small cheap-o . but , after 30 minutes hard rowing , i could tell chain more than adequate . one reviewer target website said chain exploded into million pieces while she rowing . maybe she faulty chain ; who knows . all i know i row 150 pounds weight stack gym , but there no way i could shatter chain simply rowing . stress test , i even rowed hard i possibly could , rower fine . performancethe performance this thing really great . resistance level smoothness good cardio rower i use gym . this air rower , so resistance increases harder you pull . additionally , you increase resistance wrapping tension strap around its base one time before connecting it cord under seat . seat slides very easily , foot pads swivel allow your ankles little more freedom move . also , rower folds vertically easy storage . when it folded , rower 4 feet tall takes up 2 square feet floor space . it easily fits closet or corner . although , it too wide fit under bed . valuegreat value . my buddy rower costs twice much , difference hardly noticeable . performance great , if you buy amazon item you get it tax-free free super saver shipping . i looked couple other rowers ( mainly piston rowers ) nothing even came close this level quality performance price . issuesthe only negative thing i say it little noisy ; even air rower . ( those you who never used air rower , resistance created big fan which makes " whoosh , whoosh " sound when you row . ) noise isn't terrible , but it prevents you hearing tv or radio clearly ... even ear phones . summaryso all all , i think this fantastic value . quality great , performance fantastic . i highly recommend this product	1

very solid well built substitute more expensive reformers . although there few differences convenience certain features - or rather , lack them :) - me they're quite compensated large difference price these ones peak pilates , balanced body other companies producing traditionally designed built reformers ( difference hundreds or thousands dollars , depending other model ) . my few minor issues : 1 . metal t-bar lower out way , althought there only 2 adjustments - up down . it also doesn't lower or rise easily - i thump mine into place . 2 . headrest also adjusts , although again only 2 positions - up ( couple inches ) down . 3 . winding ropes around hooks sides adjust their length various exercises bit time-consuming . more expensive reformers much more easily quickly adjusted nautical-type cleats . 4 . padding adequate , but not comfortable , yet again , more expensive models ( especially , me , shoulder rests ) . 5 . footbar adjust angle ( either straight up or angled back/forward ) but doesn't lower completely out way . instead , you remove it when needed . ( like when you want use included jumping " board " - actually nice little trampoline accessory . ) also , this isn't issue me , but it might someone else - this reformer uses 4 heavy duty bungee cords resistance , rather than springs . bottom line this reformer ( box accessory i bought separately ) , i almost * every exercise ellie herman pilates reformer book without feeling like my reformer wobbly , unstable or distraction itself . i saved lot money ;) *( those you wondering , there only 3 exercises book i can't this reformer . " rocking swan " " grasshopper " , because footbar angle doesn't lower down far enough , " round back " reverse knee stretch , its variations , because exercise your hands hold frame reformer - course aeropilates doesn't side frame boards hold . ) hope this helps	1

everything i always wanted bike , without rig it up myself . this bike made wide range uses , including mine . i like use panniers , this bike rack mounts . i love single speed . this bike rear-facing ( track-style ) dropouts- thus , i one gear each side wheel easily change low high gear without changing chain length . this not really case converted horizontal dropout frames . other non-track single speeds market look like fun but lack pannier mounts . large tire clearance super fun . first time i really noticed it when bike path congested i took off across grass . now i use this bike carry me my research site- 3 miles down primitive road over two creek crossings . so much fun . aforementioned rack , i carry tools out samples back ease . price- this price you get complete bike . no self-assembly required . those you unsure purchasing committing single speed check this out : this bike comes set screw gear cable guides screw-on rear derailleur hanger so , if you so desire , you convert it into multiple speed bike future . this nice know , although i am not sure why anyone would want deal this . once you get this thing going loaded up 50lbs gear , however , you might want avoid mountain passes , unless you don't mind walking or hitchhiking	1

i guess you get what you pay . this pedometer difficult calibrate , continued miscount steps , therefore distance , covered . it made plastic , came unclipped easily . i am big person , started walking improve my health . this product not work me , although it might different story slim person . it relegated junk drawer , probably eventually thrown away . i'll find works better purchase it	-1
i gave this pedometer one star because it not anyone who wants use it straight off shelf . this pedometer work if you not mind working it . it problems need modification . top clip this pedometer pushes against body , making vertical angle 20 degrees or more off plumb . means weighted arm inside drags circuit board not move freely . remove factory clip tabs hold it . add some adhesive velchro back case . make fabric band your ankle . attach ends each other velchro . put strip velchro outside band attaching pedometer band . i get accurate readings this pedometer when it attached inside my right ankle . i got inconsistent readings it my waistline . hair spring returns weighted arm its upright position weakened considerably after ten miles pedometer drastically undercounted . i opened pedometer added strut brace spring . strut made thin brass . aluminum soda would work , too . i made " " one end strut hold spring . i pushed lightly against spring left side , drilled hole brass , anchored strut screw lower left part circuit board . strut angles up just slightly screw anchors it . i now quite few miles pedometer . ( i theory spring weakened because its solder joint circuit board may broken slightly allowed spring twist freely . ) several times pedometer reset itself " 0 " no apparent reason . i know nothing pushed reset button . one incident while it going through scanner airport security . once it reset while i walking . twice it reset while i napping sofa . i am thinking charge static electricity overwhelmed circuit , but i not know . static electricity too many synthetic fabrics problem more expensive pedometers , too . this pedometer uses counter circuit . if someone needs inexpensive electronic counter , connect wire weighted arm wire coiled spring it contacts . connect button switch two wires . freeze weighted arm place hot glue	-1
this not fit super 9 rifles far i know . besides , it first off too high zoom also tiny ! ( most scopes whatever zoom x30 . example , i own 3-9x44 scope . this means it adjustable 3 9 times zoom . second number refers size scope lens . i'd seriously reccomend 3x30 if you get one . also make sure it dovetail if its super9 otherwise make sure it weaver rail . if you getting it super 9 not forget unscrew rear sight ( peephole )	1
billy great , full energy enthusiam . i get great results his workout much better than any other instructor . my family get great results his workout . his customer service rep helpful . however , i strongly , strongly recommend ordering your taebo products through amazon . i've doing business amazon many years placed over 150 orders . i never , never once any problems my orders amazon . when i questions , it amazing not only how quick amazon reply but give long thorough kind explanation . because they reply within day take so much time response , it shows they truly care you want give you best service possible . i've never found customer service this very high rare quality . november 2005 , after ordering billy bands official billy bank website . i sent package , without my permission company contained billy energy formula supplements . it 14 day delayed bill 31.85 . i upset this sent without me knowing but here worse part . i contacted customer service , gentleman told me don't worry you haven't billed just send us back package we'll credit you $5 into your account shipping , packaging , mailing cost you pay out your own pocket items sent back . within few days i send product i never requested back . twice phone once email 3 different cust rep i told i would receive $5 credit my bank account within 7 10 days . i already upset this matter but it wasn't big concern . however , 2 weeks well over 10 days i never received $5 credit my account . but there charge taken their company without my permisson or authorization my own personal bank account $8.97 . few days later $8.97 put back into my account . when i contacted company this their reply : thank you your recent e-mail . we apologize inconvenience . our records show your vitamin shipment 14 day delay billing cycle ( i sent item i never wanted back 7 days not over 14 day limit ) . this means when charges actually went through , you only charged small portion amount showed invoice ( i kept copy nowhere invoice this stated ) . you received credit shipping handling plus 5.00 dollars ship it back too . this means , when charge vitamins actually went through you only charged 8.97 . this also refund you received , amount paid ( again since item sent back within 14 days i shouldn't charged nowhere invoice this stated i would only charged small portion ) . so basically they sent me product i never requested . told me they would give me some money product sent back . took money my bank account without me knowing paid me back my own money they stolen . sum it up , business amazon !	-1

rechargeable flashlights sensational idea - essential part any family emergency kit ( ecologically smart boot ) . while this product satisfactory , say , science demonsration faraday principle , its usefulness flashlight considerably more limited . its credit : this flashlight meant last , stand extremes water temperature . when dropped into water , it float beam-side up easy retrieval . it so sturdy tha , it likely last lifetime user - you can't say too many products . shake this light while , disk rare earth conducts enough current sustain light small amount time . while you may read claims up one or two hours , faint but workable current only lasts ten minutes , then you shake again . again . long you don't mind repetition , wan stream bluish light serve your purposes blackout or some other emergency . but don't entertain thoughts you'll able read , find small objects , or perform any kind detail work . if you don't chance compare this its better competition , you might not know say , sherpa xray offers well-focused beam you read . while no rechargeable give you kind illumination you'll find traditional flashlight , your options brighter if you stay away diamond gen . invest something more powerful you'll find flashlight usefulness becomes considerably greater . this flashlight disappointing , useless any practical context	-1

all supposed ' resistance ' built into this machine , it enables you many -more- repetitions than you'd able simple bodyweight ' core ' exercises , ( crunches , leg lifts , situps , multitude others ) . why , what effect ? 1/ why : resistance -less- than resistance supplied weight your own body moved around without any equipment . so-called ' resistance ' actually -assists- you return motion , exact opposite exercise . 2/the effect : you must incredibly high number repetitions get any effect all , it won't much even then . high rep work should full-body cardio , not isolated ab work . ab work should same any other muscle-building work : after you 15 reps , resistance should raised : exercising abs , obliques , other core muscles strengthen build them . if exercise doesn't get difficult enough make you stop after minute or so , it simply isn't difficult enough you any good . there no such thing spot reducing exercise . modern ads know better than claim lie spot-reduction , but they still strongly imply it . why they get away it ? : because people never stop looking easy way out . re-sale value these gizmos goes down around 5 bucks soon you own it . why ? : because market flooded as-seen-on-tv , home-exercise junk that collecting dust	-1

i didn't read instructions i also buying dancing partner . this thing just * not * stay still . i tried putting it carpet wood floors , but water weight just isn't enough keep it still . power punching causes base tip then slam back floor making terrible racket . if i lived apartment , my neighbors would hate me . water ends up around 200lbs ( when full ) just doesn't trick . i thinking using sand which tops out around 320lbs , but not sure how easy it get back out since only opening small opening top meant water . springiness , you definitely wail this thing it take it ( moving across floor ) , but my opinion it too springy . there no comparison hitting hanging bag . it definitely needs tension adjustment . i'd say this bag probably better practicing control . i wouldn't suggest this apartment if you plan power-hitting	1

this bobber cooler definitely conversation piece . i so many comments it . i used it when floating down small river near home ( no rapids , just calm water ) , it doesn't hold its weight , literally . first thing opening center cooler , making it impossible get drinks out out pulling whole cooler out water . opening seam rides just barely water , since it round weight shifts little seam dip into water . cooler then fills up water , which almost immediatly melts ice , it fills up it sink bottom . maybe if there rubber gasket seal it better , it might ok . 2 plastic clasps each side used close cooler really easy break off , plus they facing wrong direction . if you bump something like rock or log , it push clasp back then unlatch cooler . this cooler might good use bodys water not current , like pool , but i don't suggest towing it behind anything . i suggest using one many inflateble coolers market	-1

this piece really quite over-priced what you get , though not knife allows you bring this plane you . i've seen this unit marketed elsewhere " travel-friendly " swiss army tool ( not knife ) . nevertheless , unit i 64mb version : asin : b0002vm8zm ... which costs considerably less ( ~ $30 ) amazon , same 128mb usb drive red light unit this page , plus you get small quantity swiss army tools including knife . unless you concerned going plane , i'd recommend asin : b0002vm8zm over unit this page . btw , i got my handy little 64mb unit ( which i'd give four stars if i option ) only $9.99 clearance target .	1
it may say " slow cooker " front item , but i assure you , it anything but slow ! i looking crock pot camping using propane told this item me ! so , i made my hungarian ghoulash it , glad night meal would 8-10 hours when we got back beach . all i say , thank goodness my husband noticed it bubbling inside cooker half hour later , or we wouldn't anything but charcoal left , we left campsite day without checking it ! it cooking low , it literally half hour time . so , keep mind , if you camping you haven't tried using this product yet , it won't take long before your meal . sadly , my crock pot recipes put away rest trip- campground we didn't electricity , hence why i wanted propane crock pot .	-1

( you'd think $100 , you'd get glove every detail medium high quality . ) i cutoff hanging label entirely . third , product description states five distinct layers foam glove your hand point contact . 10 oz glove , it doesn't feel like anything special , just thin layer foam . i'm not impressed padding . overall , glove medium low quality . it even looks cheap . ( leather less than millimeter thick stitching ordinary . ) i'll use glove i've already spent money , but my next glove i think going title platinum . unfortunately , everlast seems gone way cheap mass production net profit sacrifice it reputation	1

i am surprised this bike gotten good reviews ; i am quite diappointed . i purchased this bike after looking many mountain bikes decided this seemed good buy . however , it turned out not so . first all , bike really ugly its white brownish colors , though i suppose that personal issue . performance , this bike not worth its stated price over $200 , so don't think you getting some great deal . suspension leaves something desired it seems shifting funny . i am not expert bikes , but i'm pretty sure shifting supposed little smoother than this . also , after week , i noticed strange noise coming bike i peddled . it hard explain ... almost like something out place . so again , bike not worth this price . perhaps if it sold around $100 it would decent deal	-1

i two these units ( sg2 sg4 ) all i say " don't believe hype " . while units unbelievable concept tv work ( note : when they work ) great , lack computer knowledge unbelievably awful customer service provided skygolf , itself , sufficient reason choose product this arena . just relay my experience ( keep mind i 15 years high technology industry leverage open when attempting set-up these units ) , it took almost six hours phone set-up my original sg2 even then it constantly destabilizing my system software ( ie-endless restarts ) . when sg2 stolen event , i purchased sg4 obtain next generation product . since january 2 , 2007 , purchase date , i phone no less than eight customer service representatives total amount time approaching ten hours ( including one saturday morning , prior sunday event , when they requested i attend conference call regarding my unit 5am ( no , not typing error my part ! ) california time ) . i purchased/received ( skygolf sent me one unit their headquarters out desperation ) returned three sg4s various points process ensure units not damaged . i attempted download software access website via sg4 five different computers every single service pack microsoft windows 2000 . even after i forwarded skygolf computer log show them problem ( software error ) neither software developers nor customer service department could figure out what wrong units never operational . this point , all i say what complete utter waste time this process how frustrating ( echo review ) it deal people behind product . no product , no matter how fabulous concept , worth this level incompetence during set-up operation . good luck you if you purchase product . i hope your experience better than mine .	-1

********** update - old review ( see below ) dixiekip . only reason it still two stars because i can't figure out how change it . old vegas chips nothing but helpful this matter even though i didn't actually order cards them . i would order them any day week now just based their customer service issue wasn't even theirs . my apologies old vegas chips this matter . i highly recommend them if anyone knows how change stars , please let me know . if you interested these cards , go old vegas chips , not some other dealer !!!! - jim ****************** i ordered these particular plastic cards because my opinion , they much cooler than paisley ones also offered . i immediately ordered them , yet when my package arrived yesterday ( timely manner , i give them ) i opened find ugly paisley cards looking me face . i not yet contacted seller see what options i , but this going leave me either two options , 1 ) return them wait longer them or 2)suck it up get stuck ugly cards . i repost once i spoken them	1
i regret buying this gun . it broke within four days buying it . we just enough shooting adjust hop-up(for accuracy ) , it fired great . it really accurate . gun made really cheap plastic , trigger stopped working . right now , we're waiting rma it . i would recommend paying little extra , buy more durable gun . i bought gun cost $55 , one made much better plastic feels much more durable	-1

i rated 2 stars because joint kid bike parent bike too lose child almost falling off bike . i also contact company who made this product they told me they send part make child bike straight , but i never recived part . i am very disappointment because safety my kid first they didn't help me . i hope some future purchase company assist me my needs . thank you	1
my complaints this stand : 1 . far worst thing this stand it leans too far forward . there not enough counter-weight so slight pull bike cause thing tip . if it wasn't this , i might say , " well i guess it alright 79 dollars . " 2 . clamp isn't strong enough hold bike securely . if you clamp seat-post example it rotate seat-post . 3 . thing tightens clamp made plastic . i'm assuming it break fairly quickly . 4 . rotator made plastic - i haven't tried rotating seat post where it would put any weight rotator , but i doubt it hold it . my opinion this product should not sold . if you just want clean your bike stand , it fine , but anything requires any force like taking pedals or crank arms off , forget-about-it	1

when it windy , top canopy like this needs removed prevent wind damage . no information available how long it takes this . i called d.c. america they say they only distributors buy it overseas no idea no manuals available online me look . they said it takes few hours assemble or disassemble . one retailer i spoke , fogdog , guesses it would need disassembled remove top , but he admitted they not tried assembling it . so it appears what these two sources said every time wind storm comes up , it would require half-a-day disassemble it then reassemble it - not something i care . there any owners out there answer this question ? frame left up only top covering removed ? if so , how long would it take remove top covering ? it easy ? it nice looking unit , but unfortunately sellers cannot answer most basic question item like this . thanks .	1

after 350 miles moderate usage ( 6.5 mph average fairly low resistance 40 minutes daily ) piece metal snapped one arms , rendering trainer inoperable . unfortunately this considered " wear item " not warrantied manufacturer since elliptical used * very * lightly ( perhaps 20 miles max ) during first year purchase ( warranty period ) . i put majority mileage machine over past four months , while it great burning calories , i never really felt it " quality " piece equipment . it appears manufacturer knows what parts frame likely break first conveniently labels these " wear items " , thus making repair expensive difficult ... this spite fact piece broke non-moving , load-bearing support piece . seems little fishy me . throughout life machine i constantly tightening bolts fix popping banging sounds occurred after moderate use , observed wheels would often attempt jump out tracks heavier use . after 70 miles i noted wheels leaving large greyish streaks tracks where they wearing down against imperfections track surface . i believe this also partly due too much " play " interaction wheels tracks , allowing wheels jump tracks little which each revolution . this machine not feel very sturdy , throughout last month its very short life , gave me creepy sense impending doom whenever i used it ... somehow i knew it break , unfortunately , it . my hunch real enough i began shopping replacement several weeks ago . please shop around ... i would not recommend this machine people looking moderate high intensity workout , but it may fine slower walking or jogging paced routines place less stress machine mechanical components . if you infrequent user this model may ok , but if you plan using it every day i would recommend you keep looking . note my machine 428p which , time purchase , differed 418 primarily computer heart rate monitoring . frame identical 418 428p , which appears no longer sold . since problems my machine directly related body construction , they appropriate review 418 . unless manufacturer made major improvements problems i experienced likely still occur . visual inspection pictures here leads me believe no major changes made frame construction	1

just a/b comparison sx800r ( 16 mile range)and midland gxt-450 ( 10 or 12 mile range ) . neither radio came anywhere near effective range advertised . midland lost communcation after 1/2 mile apart woods . i then tried both radios flat open road . 2.9 miles apart , neither radio could pick up it counterpart . it wasn't until we hit 1.8 mile mark motorola picked up some static other motorola . still nothing midland . approx 1.5 miles apart , motorola worked fine . i gave up midland . reason i not give motorola 1 star rating because i like weather band feature . bottom line , unless you airplane no obstructions all or curvature earth worry , forget getting anywhere near advertised range . good rule thumb , if you see other person , then you range .	1
i attracted thermoskin product because it looked more comfortable than rigid splints night wear , because thermoskin advertised it could worn while sitting during day . product indeed clever-seeming design , it well manufactured . but ultimately , this product seems me too floppy unstable consistently stretch out area foot feels me like it needs stretched . ( i.e. , area sole my foot i feel stretching out mornings when , before getting out bed while sitting up it , i press my toes hard against looped cord or towel ; stretch significantly diminishes my pain upon standing up out bed . ) velcro fastenings indeed secure , but product sock-like sleeve ankle cuff move around some even when straps cinched down tight they'll go ; result , what feels like appropriate stretch typically disappears five or ten minutes normal movement friction bed while lying down . worse , angle created pulling strap up through buckle front lower leg just doesn't create proper stretch ; instead it just makes my toes feel crampy . i'm going try rigid split , which may less comfortable . but i believe i need strapped into something consistently maintains proper angle , which thermoskin product doesn't . i'd rather incur some discomfort , if it actually help me get well , than continue use this not too uncomfortable ( but ineffective ) product thermoskin . perhaps others or better results it than i ; i no medical training nor deep insight into anatomy or physiology beyond what i've read internet , so consider this very much layman review . i've suffering plantar faciitis now four five months little improvement , i can't compare this product others i hope might more effective . but i very disappointed this product , regret spent money it	1

i purchased two these , one each my sons . i received them quickly packaging good shape . when we took first one out tightened handlebars so get it ready charge ride everything seemed ok . but wires where you plug charger into 4 wheeler tightened so place you turned key change speeds . got it charging , we think . then we start second one . we take it out charger half melted . ok , not too good but since we ordered two we thought we could just use charger other one since they same . well , when we plugged charger second four wheeler after 1 hour we went back out garage where it charging charger we using come first four wheeler started melt ! nevermind house could caught fire ! so apparently someone plugged original charger already happened , rather than someone just packaged defective charger . nice someone pack it back up send it me used defective . first four wheeler turned ran ok few minutes so it must charged , we went ahead plugged it up instructions said - if we received it brand new like we thought we . when it used first time it ran little over hour , only light popping out front every little bump . light didn't work . while trying re-attach light we found several places needed tightened up . we can't re-charge it though because only good charger two melted . when we first took these out boxes they small ( big enough 3 or 4 year old ) but they looked pretty sturdy , much better than plastic ones you get walmart , i paid close same amount . they difficult get out packaging , because there metal frame box needed taken apart , but should good , protect during shipping . however when you think how you going get them back metal frame box shipping send them back so someone possibly see how bad whole mess you start get cranky tired . i admit i haven't tried return them . i am quite worried it much trouble these things already . i am tempted though , because i would like let people know this type problem before they waste their money . imagine how dissapointed i right before christmas i couldn't give kids two their bigger gifts because they junk . i am very upset . so now several hundred dollars ( times two ) could bought very nice christmas presents just flushed down drain .	-1

overall steel frame structure it good , but there too many flaws this product , i recommend going something else . flaws : 1 ) bands not give you good increments resistence . if you want even resistance each side , you go 20 lbs 40lbs one setting , which crazy . 2 ) workout assembly manuals terrible . especially workout manual - what use machine if correct use it not demonstrated ? what really say how much stamina cares people using it correctly , without injury , getting good benefit out it ? only 10 exercises really shown , rest just single pictures let you vaguely guess what you supposed , except many some other machine , not this one . i'm sure someone get injured incorrect use . 3 ) many pictures misleading , such you can't actually many exercises suggested or inferred pictures . one customer service person told me pictures some prototype machine . ridiculous . 4 ) several construction pieces i received bad caused problems , but replacement parts shipped no problem , albeit it meant waiting week or so each one , then time reconstruct machine . i replace main rail main leg support frame piece because they both welded wrong . 5 ) leg padding inadequate painful6 ) doesn't seem product understood or cared stamina , no one i called seems use it or really tell you it . company claims care health fitness , they really don't show it this product or support this product . i'd go elsewhere .	-1
real colorful flashy bike , however there several things wrong it . 1 . tires so much excess rubber , it trimmed or else it rubbed . 2 . back wheel completely removed loosen bearings . if not , bike would basically come stop itself . 3 . main ( front ) sprocket slightly bent , so chain falls off constantly . 4 . bike if very heavy . maybe makes it sturdy , but it also makes it tough 4 year old ride . i should just bought bike off floor wal-mart or target half price	1

we past owned step single jogger . it wasn't perfect but it certainly met our needs . it always needed tipped back change direction it rusted little because we left it outside . if we stayed only child family it would continued working but addition baby we decided sell it . after transition over year now weather warming up we decided get double jogger strolling . we purchased step run around ltd 2 jogging stroller hopes it would meet our new needs . problems single stroller seemed compounded double stroller . my husband no problem getting it together but complained cheap caliper style break ... it doesn't stop stroller barely even slows it down . it took him same amount time work break it took him assemble whole jogger . after we placed our three year old our 18 month old it test ride . when placing them we encountered our next problem ... seats even highest point super reclined . they wanted no part laying back but instead both utterly thrilled sit far forward mess each other . straps six inch long safety label sewn webbing made it almost impossible thread them through front buckle . so off we set our test drive . it really hard push almost impossible turn . after while we figured out letting kids sit so far forward threw off balance whole jogger . only way make it partially work let out both seats fully reclined position , criss-cross shoulder straps constantly yell " stay down kids ... if you sit up one more time i'm going sit it make you push me ! " well we got home our test run my husband pulled out cardboard box resigned air began job taking it apart . i don't recommend this item . all honesty our radio flyer pathfinder wagon job more effectivel	-1

let me start saying this wonderful product . small , light , well constructed ( they feel like they last forever ) . you carry them you , allowing workout your fingers office , home or wherever you find suitable . i bought four different color-coded gripmasters : black/heavy , red/medium , blue/light , yellow/extra light . i only found resistance red black ones useful me , but my wife loves blue yellow ones . it great buy because their high quality affordable price . product comes foldable instruction booklet where you find details six different exercises : - trigger pinch . this one simulates movement squeezing trigger , it isolates index finger enhanced strength coordination . - gross grasp . this one strengthens fingers , thumb , wrist forearm firm grip . - hook position . this one strengthens longer muscles forearm wrist while stretching smaller muscles hand greater motion endurance . - tip tip pinch . this exercise strengthens specific fingers , thumb , smaller hand muscles forearm greater control endurance . - wrist flexion . it strengthens wrist forearm muscles . - key pinch . strengthens thumb index finger greater stability coordination . gripmaster website you find more exercises different activities sports . if you looking crush hands when handshaking this not product you , but if you need finger strength , control , endurance coordination you right place	1

i write lot reviews books , but seldom write one product . however ; i feel like breaking my trend reviewing this lite . i , like i suppose , just everyone else , keep looking lite right all people , all purposes . if it exists , i haven't seen it ye t.t he plain ordinary battery flashlight remained essentially same since i got my first kid , 60 years ago . they often fail you when they needed , batteries expensive , but overall they serve purpose . 50 years ago , hand held magneto lite appeared . long you kept squeezing it , it gave light comparable normal flashlght . it similar lite sold use bicycle , where it powered turning wheel . however ; soon bicycle stopped , light went out . some reason , they disappeared off market . few years ago , new almost similar magneto lite appeared . biggest difference , it made lot noise when squeezed . they don't appear very popular . this faraday principle lite made very popular due tv ads , more because what they don't say than what they say , many people disappointed upon getting one . ad flouts idea it seen up mile . sowhat !, we learned military , lit cigarette seen hundreds yards away night . so , if that not you looking , it meaningless you . fact , it very poor casting light suface more than few feet away . this purpose , it can't begin compete normal flashlight ; if that what you want , forget it . matter fact , those little led keychain lites just much ; picked up buck " dollar stores " . they last couple years , weigh next nothing , you'll always one you . i leave them around house they handy look something dark spot , or occasional time you need find circuit breaker panel or find your way power failure . these lites so weak you can't assume they meet your expectations store , or watching tv ad . my advice try compare key chain lite , one might serve you well other , huge difference cost .	1
this gamble since it isn't cheap results promised no different any other supplement ad campaign . i only tried muscle milk because i read up it after seeing it endorsed nfl athelete during espn interview . i started using it 2 months ago consistant servings daily . two months later my strength increased , my mass increased my body fat noticeably diminished . my workout routine diet always same before starting mm but results since using mm made impact , there nothing else i attribute it . fact it also tastes great nice bonus but given definite results mm i would still use it if it tastes like battery acid . not fool yourself , it loaded fat . it relies you workout steadily maintian clean diet you realize it true benefit . you not get sculpted using mm without commitment , you only get fatter . but if you committed use mm suggested it most certainly produce change your appearance .	1
i don't actually own one yet , but my boyfriend so i've sneaking over his house use it until i make room my own home one . when i first used it i like some other reveiwers , disappointed it didn't work my abs way i expected , but then i realized i wasn't doing it correctly . it makes it pretty easy use your legs arms instead just your abs so it helps focus beginning just using your abs nothing else then you really feel it ! strap way too small though , i usually just put my fingers under it , but there no way somme things lady video , like sticking your arms through strap holding them straight ... i pretty small arms . range motion thing great , feels so good back , which complete opposite doing crunches ground(i used 1,000 crunches day but then i started getting bruises my back them i pretty much hit plateau where i wasn't seeing any changes my abs ) . i so much fun using ab lounge while i watch tv too , it great way make commercial time go . i would recommend people problems this try go slowly really focus working just your abs , it makes it so much more worth it	1
two years ago , i tore one transverse ligaments my wrist playing racquetball , which unfortunate combination dusty court , 200 pounds player moving 15 miles hour , poorly timed forehand very hard wall . i two surgeries repair injury , it mostly successful . biggest side effect weakness my injured wrist hand . i moved beyond squeezing toys putty , but i lacked strength weight training . this device tremendous breakthrough me . i able make some rapid gains my strength without risking injury weights . i am already seeing difference just two weeks . if you recovering surgery such carpal tunnel or other wrist related injuries , i strongly recommend making this device part your recovery plan . course , check your doctor and/or physical therapist before starting up new exercise	1
i originally bought blue ( 5 lb ) , red ( 7 lb ) black ( 9 lb ) gripmasters my 14 year old boys . blue little too easy gripping but excellent exercising ring little finger . blue too easy them so they not use it so i ended inherited it . it pretty habit forming fun use because tension light , this makes it good use anytime , anywhere . ( i used it stuck traffic it also good stress reliever ) if i it again , i would probably not bought this tension unless you very light grip , probably started red . just remember this mainly fingers hand exercise so very easy use gripping , challenge working out fingers . it not like using regular heavy hand grippers . it increased my hand strength grip just it me using it during course day without planned workouts . great product , excellent finger or hand exercise , good quality	1
i recently purchased pair gripmaster hand finger exercisers order help build forearm strength . i unsure which tension would appropriate , i bought one each light/blue ( 5 lbs . tension ) medium/red ( 7 lbs . tension ) grips . i've them little more than week now , i just love , love , love them ! perhaps that little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up exercise accessories , but i really enjoy grips . i leave one out my desk all times , get little work here there when i stop read document or whatnot . gripmaster exercisers different conventional grips you either work your entire hand once , or each finger individually ( great guitar players , i've heard ! ) . one side features four small levers , each its own spring , squeezed together or one time . plastic flip side molded together so you work your whole hand one unit . black rubber cushion removable , you place it either side grip . it awesome idea , allows maximum versatility ! just reference , i'm female , relatively good shape , but painfully little forearm strength ( my biceps huge years tae bo , though ! ) . 7 lb . medium/red grip do-able , but challenging . 5 lb . light/blue grip , other hand , makes much easier workout ; i oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things , i only feel it after number reps . if you're female not great shape , you'll want start out light/blue grips ( or even extra light/yellow ones ) , work your way up . out-of-shape guys probably get away medium/red ones start . if you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength , don't even both lighter tensions - skip ahead medium/red or heavy/black . although i've only owned my gripmasters week or two , can't personally vouch their durability , they seem sturdy well-crafted . my fianc brother , amateur boxer guitar player , used his years without problem , so i faith i'll squeezing these babies well into 2015 ! - kelly garbato , couch potato turned fitness fanati	1

we got this bike our 4 year old , it sturdy rugged enough last next few years . assembly instructions looked intimidating first , but since many pieces already pre-assembled you skip most them . it lot easier than anticipated . only reason why i gave it 4 stars : it deep scratch/paint chip frame . but since i got this during sale great price considering it needed next day we kept it anyway	1
cord-wrapped handle great idea , offering more real sword-like look well firmer grip . my hands tend get sweaty slip around bit long practice , particularly sealed lacquered finish most bokken . this wrap really helps ( though it needed touch glue get it stay place ) . two-piece guard design nice enhancement too . though you really don't need guard all many applications it nice looking appears stronger than original . it still fairly cheap piece wood , compared ironwood version , but this price ( it $9.99 when i bought it ) you really can't go wrong . nice enhancement over basic bokken . i , however , prefer natural wood version this one it looks pretty bad once you start using it color scrapes off . nevertheless , if you want inexpensive practice sword this one recommended ...	1

this bag much better than normal bop bags far rebound action . old style falls all down ground then slowly comes back standing position . this one much more like real bag snapping back not hitting ground unless you hit it hard coarse . my kid 4 5 years only use bag supervised taught proper punching/elbow/knee kicking strikes ! i would never leave this bag alone them thrash , it would break real quick h20 base , not good . great young kids learn ....

i found myself staggered sticker shock while shopping decent pair mtb glove , 30-40 dollars . no offense makers these woefully overpriced digit protectors , but please ! i some research web , harbinger gloves received good reviews couple different sources . price fourth competitors , so i thought why not try them out . gloves great , i very pleased their performance . not only they cool look factor , but they also well made . there decent cushion(no gel unfortunately)built into meaty areas palm , where you would expect need it . additionally , velcro connection comes little higher wrist , full palm protection , which i like . nice touch tough material used palm around thumb fingers . it serves dual purposes protection grip . it definitely tough handled some hard , hands first , touch downs . downside , i know i might get sweaty hands this summer(live sw desert ) because palm area all plastic verses leather . yet , this fair trade protection rugged construction . if you dont want spend 40 bucks gloves , dont need gel cushion these best bang buck	1
let me just start this review out making it clear i am huge basketball/nba/wnba/cba fan . i picked up this basketball started dribbling it . i amazed two things . first all , it bounces really high you very rarely keep pumping it up like you some other basketballs . you use it both outside/indoors although it geared more indoors then outdoors . second all , grip basketball very good , so it won't slip out your hands . this only basketball i actually owned doesn't slip out my hands . wrap things up , i end my review making it clear you should go spalding buy this basketball	1

bad news first : extension cables very stiff , they're shipped tight loop . don't expect them straighten out easily . they don't come extra clips attach them foot straps . i just swap cables whichever bowflex station i'm not using get much better feel . ball ... ball . it job . little pump they supply it isn't great , but it also job . maybe you'll tone your arms pumping up ball . ;-) there no check valve ball , so prepared get pump out plug fast , once it fully inflated . mat looks bit cheap , but it comfortable it keep you sliding around . video decent . even if you already know what you're doing , it worth watching see how moves using bowflex . so far , i wouldn't say you've even come close justifying purchase price . but those foot straps just brilliant ! once you've gotten them adjusted , they'll go off no problem , making it easy add stretches regular workout without losing your momentum . but once you them secured they won't come off , or even shift much , when you're performing exercises . may sound like no big deal , but i've used straps took forever put wandered all over place while doing movements . four points cable attachment well-placed solid . i've doing resistance stretches long time , these best straps i've ever used . they're worth price admission	1

this first cathe strength workout i've tried , i found it intense challenging without gruelling . however , keep mind this advanced workout , so intermediates like myself probably need lift less weight than cathe ( i generally used 1/2 2/3 what cathe using ) order complete workout . cathe uses variety equipment this workout , including barbell , several sets dumbbells , full club step , toning band , but i able get without barbell , step , or band ( although my modifications may further lowered intensity workout ) . main workout muscle max 68 minutes long , but dvd also offers several premixes : upper body only ( 42 minutes ) , upper body push-pull ( 33 minutes ) , lower body only ( 23 minutes ) , timesaver ( 56 minutes ) . full workout breaks down follows : warm-up , lower body , chest , back , lower body , shoulders , bicep , tricpes , core stretch ( dvd includes subchapters under each above categories ; see cathe web site full list exercises plus video clip ) . during warm-up , you constantly moving rather than performing static stretches , but i liked cathe still managed thoroughly stretch each muscle group going worked . also , cathe constantly varies count , which adds interest well varying intensity each movement . thing i liked this workout cathe allows plenty time exercises , thereby providing you opportunity rest change your weights needed . i also enjoyed upbeat music , some it vocal . overall , this routine left me feeling completely worked out , yet not exhausted , which means it enjoyable little dread factor . i think both advanced exercisers intermediates who modify get great workout this video -- highly recommended	1

i love this ab wheel , but some reviews here ridiculous , like when woman claims it burned off 20 pounds month . that 72,000 calories , or 2400 calories day . put perspective , you'd run 24 miles day , every day , take off 20 pounds month just through exercise . let say you use this devise 3 minutes before you tire out . heck , give it benefit doubt say 5 minutes . means it might burn off 50 calories day . if you every day ( unlikely , because your abs would want some rest ) , you could burn off just under half pound month . that based some pretty optimistic assumptions . so it not weight loss device . but it great ab strengthener , better than anything else i've use . it'll tighten up your stomach like crazy , long you some cardio burn keep fat off , you'll end up great , flat , ripped up stomach .	1
good : * i couldn't find these bricks-and-mortar stores all , it relief purchase them affordably through vendor i trust . * 1-lb weight inserts make it easy adjust weight , cuff or off . * i using them two weeks , effect my workout - my legs - tremendous . bad : * cuffs " adjustable " two long velcro straps wrap all way around ankle . no matter how carefully i wrap them , i just can't get them tight i'd like . straps which wrap double back through d-rings would much more useful . * cuffs tend ride down dig into tops my feet . cushioned gel or not , i can't exactly call " comfortable . " i'm not sure whether this specific this brand , or typical ankle weight cuffs . overall : i wish i'd able try these some other brands before i purchased them . however , i'm delighted found them results i'm seeing	1

msr pocket rocket great little cooker . best going light fast . perfect shared stove among two people , even better simple boiling or melting snow drinking water . i would suggest this stove use maximum pot capacity two liters , more than this it becomes little unstable . if your menu simple you live instant meals require only boiling water this stove you . because this stove designed minimalist , it tiny very concentrated hot spot , so if you backcountry gourmet want cook pancakes eggs you might better off stove larger flame spread . again , great boiling water melting snow , but not actual cooking	1

reviewer said : i think this product needs few improvements , but all it strong value proposition . here what i would improve if i charge : 1 . higher resolution screen so gui could present more information . 2 . macintosh compatibility . 3 . pc cable should included . it stands , cable pc software costs nearly much device itself . i say : far higher resolution goes , i wouldn't want print any smaller , especially if you deal direct sunlight otherwise you would hard pressed see readout . concerning issue 2 3 i no comment because i not purchase software . however concerning unit itself , i noted following improvements which allow me grade this product 5 stars . noted suggestions modification ecaddy . 1 . clip should remain , however ecaddy should attached clip via strong pull cord . this allow quick easy interaction ecaddy .

i bought red ge lantern couple years ago . i used it power outages , walking my dogs morning night during winter , rarely , i've even used it camping . i haven't any definitive studies but battery life seems longer than 16 hours ge states . i find light strong enough read . during dog walks lantern all but submerged rain it hasn't phased it . it performance not affected colder temperatures even down teens . though i admit , neither dogs , or i wanted out very long weather cold . workmanship very nice . i recently looked coleman lanterns they gone flimsy plastic top . ge lantern built very sturdily but light enough carry one hand still control leashed dog . only downside i've found , i don't consider this big issue , if lantern knocked hard enough , say you slip fall down ravine rain , batteries slip out place somewhat light either dim or go out . it easy fix , just transfer both dog leashes one hand , turn lantern upside down , unscrew base enough so batteries settled back where they belong tighten base back up . i would definitely purchase ge lantern .	1

first off , those you calling it " clip " should know clip nonremovable ammunition storage device attatched or built into gun itself . please call it magazine ( actual name it ) full metal jacket isnt full magazine amunition its bullet full metal casing like say 3 0-0 6 round . second , dont complain scope because it decorative instrument . you buy better scopes if your hardcore but if you hardcore then get real gun . this gun good shooting your little cousin far away . its great gun dont get me wrong but its not meant used abused like ww2 garand or bar . it plastic , it shoots things . i'm probably reinstating most what everyone else said but thats just one more reassurance . so yeah get this gun if airsoft hobby you . not sport . i also suggest getting . 20g bbs maybe speedloader or 2 cause mags so expensive this gun pours ammo like water . fu n.p.s. though they may noth trigger finger ability , spring airsoft guns tendency more accurate fire harder heavier bb . if you playin friends i suggest getting $30 dollar rifle 250-300 fps ( shoots like 300-350	1

this review focus specs since there minimal information available unless you buy bike . first off , this my second mongoose . i started out crappy low end cruiser model , so anything even half step up model vast improvement . theory weighs 38 lbs actually light grey color despite image this website . i thought i getting white bike , i'm little ticked it actually grey , but , whateva . assembly isn't too bad long you half clue what you're doing . documentation adequate , but don't expect able assemble this bike correctly if you haven't it before . documentation frustrate you . but average person probably install pedals saddle , maybe even mount handlbars correctly assuming brakes don't arrive screwed up like mine . front cable relocated because when it assembled plant , it threaded immediately under fork tire rubbing against it so it removed resituated , which entailed messing front cable . simple enough , i suppose , but this assumes you know what you're doing . i couldn't install front tire correctly because disc brake , , wanting safe instead stupid , i took bike lbs them install it . it then i found out one disc pads missing . no problem . i just went back home found it box . apparently it become dislodged housing front tire during transit . i didn't even know it there because i haven't worked disc pads before . it good thing i didn't toss box right away otherwise i would sol . just advised , however , if you missing one or both disc pads toss out box before you realize one pads missing , depending where you , you may or may not able find replacement pads . you may end up upgrade better brand disc brake . now onto specs . front disc brake promax brand , dsk-400 , which world mtn biking , generic low end . i some digging around web find following site because you won't find " [ ... ] " website . it wasn't really all much more helpful not help me understand disc brakes any better , but least you'll better idea what look . documentation site color images vs black white images come enclosed bike . go here instead : [ ... ] i wouldn't call promax disc brake crap , but , close enough . note : if you plan doing any kind semi-serious mtn biking , trail considered " intermediate " level , then upgrade disc brakes . if you're planning real mtn biking trip rocks logs whole nine , then theory probably handle it , just don't expect miracles . gears , there 21 shimano flavored they work flawlessly . they're pleasure because there isn't usual slipping dragging you see lower end mongoose mtn bikes . only problem i upper gears don't seem want shift into any gear definitely unless you downshift say , 2 , then upshift 3 , example , so forth others . if you want 6 , then go 5 , then upshift vice versa . this may or may not because cogs need lubed . ride , theory dual-suspension bike you really feel difference vs hard-tail bike . wow . just riding street going over speed bumps rain gulleys amazing . you very little no shock all because suspension absorbs it . overall , this bike good bang buck , but i wouldn't pay over $300.00 tops it . if you're going go high , you get something else higher end parts . oh , one last thing . if you value your reproductive organs , don't want find yourself numb package exit and/or sitting bag frozen peas week after using bike , then yourself favor switch out saddle . one comes theory horrible . get thicker padded , gel lined , split saddle instead .	1

friend who successful competition mountain bike rider asked me weigh blackburn airfix after i bought it . he many occasions where his chain broken , or his tires punctured , so he wanted compare weight blackburn versus weight all individual tools he carried when he rides . airfix weighed 245 grams - 8 ounces - his tools , including inflator , tire levers , hex wrenches chain tool ( all included airfix ) tipped scales 337 grams - 11 ounces . i suppose multitool may not convenient use individual tools , but handiness , this seems hard beat . blackburn lifetime/no-questions-asked guarantee also very attractive . so while i yet put this tool into action either my trek 2200zr or my trek 6000 , world where every ounce weight heavy concern , pardon pun , i imagine i made wise purchase	1
i really like this bike . it feels like bike ' 50s but all modern technology . look great draws lot attention . it somewhat simple complete bike since it arrives mostly put together but assembly instructions worst i ever seen any product . i basically got no clue instructions how finish off bike , it hard believe how poorly they written . i beginning believe they sent me wrong directions . after i got it together through trial error brakes shifter way out whack i spend $30 local bike shop get these items adjusted ; instructions making adjustment not work . guys bike shop took two attempts get it right ( two trips me ) they wondering why it so difficult adjust . after all i love bike it rides nicely when properly adjusted , shifts brakes very nicely . ride comfortable i love seat location handlebars . i would recommend bike all fun looks it but prepared some hassle get it right unless you one lucky ones who gets one adjusted correctly out box . my suggestion manufacture this bike fire idiot who wrote assembly instructions hire someone some writing skills . i also not understand why brakes shifter so far out adjustment ; no one test bike before they boxed it up	1

two most respected bodybuilding supplements ( 1)whey protein ( 2)creatine . they also considered natural products or food products . while whey without doubt extremely useful , creatine not help everybody . i used creatine monohydrate past i found it useless . it so utterly ineffective i just felt robbed my hard earned money . my tub still sits cupboard . i never used any other supplement products other than ones seem safe side these both . i heard no-xplode some bodybuilders who seemed think it probably one best supplement products come out years . i researched it it appears bsn formulated surging " creatine + nitric oxide " drink seems work most people . not everybody sees results but this stuff worked me what counts . although no-xplode contains some serious chemistry ( see below ) possibly some debatable compounds ( guanidino propionic acid [ gpa ] glycocamine ) it probably well worth very low-level risks results . 40 minutes after taking this stuff i either cardio high intensity 30 min flat ( maybe even more ) complete full range compound weight lifts gym without feeling any interruption my power . no fatigue . surge exactly it promises . you feel you nitro pumping around your body . it sets 20 minutes me . i feel little woozy first , disorientated , then my brain picks up my body feels energetic . put it into action you see results . it also boats cem3 type creatine prevents you bloating up like monohydrate . i never stepped much outside what considered safe but my opinion no-xplode standing fence saying i am best bang your buck without any serious side effects . so far this stuff getting very good feedback . yes it contains lots mind boggling ingredients , but if you looking creatine edge , even if creatine never worked you before , then no-xplode probably one . it also help build muscle , but even if it doesn't you , it still worth it surge . i am very glad i got it . very . serving size : 1 scoop ( 20.5 g)servings per container : 40amount per serving : calories : 36-calories fat : 0total fat : 0g-saturated fat : 0gcholesterol : 0mgsodium : 150mgpotassium : 75mgtotal carbohydrates : 9g-sugars : 0gprotein : 0gvitamin b6 : 25mg-(pyridoxine hcl)vitamin b12 : 120mcg-(cyanocobalamine)folic acid : 400mcgmagnesium : 360mgphosphorus : 500mgcalcium : 75mgno-xplode proprietary blend : 20,500 mg(no-xplode contains patent pending nutrient suspension matrix efforsorb delivery system)no meta-fusion ( patent pending)(l-arginine akg , citral-m ( citrulline malate ) , l-citrulline akg , l-histidine akg , rc-nos ( rutacarpine 95%) , gynostemma pentaphyllum ( 95% gypenosides ) , nad ( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)muscle volumizing creatine matrix ( patent pending)cem3 ( creatine ethyl ester malate ) , 2cm ( dicreatine malate ) , betapure ( trimethylglycine ) , glycovol ( glycocyamine ) , guanipro ( guanidino proplonic acid ) , cinnulin pf ( aqueous cinnamon extract ) , keto-isocaproate potassiumener-tropic xplosion ( patent pending)l-tyrosine , taurine , endurlac ( glucuronolactone ) , l-tyrosine akg , methylxanthines ( caffeine ) , mct ( medium chain triglycerides ) , vinpocetine 99% , vincamine 99% , vinburnine 99%phospho-electrolyte replacercalcium phosphate , magnesium oxide , potassium phosphate , sodium phosphateglycerol hydrating polymerspotassium glycerophosphate , magnesium glycerophosphate , glycerola stearat	1

i bought this croquet set late last summer backyard ge t-t ogethers neighbors . none us played before , so we didn't need top-of-the-line , price right this set . it everything it needs : weighty , colorful , compact its case . widgets pretty bendy , but if they bend out shape , they bend right back . turned out good investment . word warning if you small dogs : put them house before you let your neighbors loose mallets round projectiles . my little dachshund picked up bad habit chasing balls pushing them further off-course . it funny , until she darted into path one bright orange ball , which made solid contact her little head . ( she fine now , but no longer fan game . ) all all , i would highly recommend set like this around if you room your backyard fun neighbors	1
i didn't know what expect , but these turned out very good quality . they stretch well return shape . they don't feel like they going snap apart when you middle exercising . i very pleased product . careful , though , if you latex allergy . i also got excellent service company ! i would definitely business them again	1
there not lot information out there using this extractor cars , because i think most people buy it boats instead . so i'm going talk how well it works changing oil your car . summary , it works great . it really nice able change your oil your own time your own home without getting dirty . i'm never going jiffy lube again . it even works great my lawnmower . using extractor very easy . just remove your dipstick , insert extractor tube into dipstick hole until end reaches bottom oil pan ( it might take some practice get feel this part ) . once everything place , pump 10-20 times . this cause extractor suck out oil like straw . it takes 15 minutes 3 quarts . that also why i recommend 6-liter model instead 2.5 -liter one , so you suck out all oil one shot . some people wonder whether all oil removed this way . unfortunately , i can't really speak , because would require me open drain plug investigate . however , consensus stuff i've read internet extractor remove much oil traditional method . because changing my oil so easy extractor , i always change my oil time . previously , i drove thousands miles past my " due date " because stopping oil change too inconvenient . extractor should used after engine running . oil less viscous contaminants stirred up , making extractor more effective . also , please remember your old oil must properly recycled . most mechanic shops accept your old oil ( i put it plastic orange juice container ) , just call ahead make sure	1

this great bike . i gave one my 2 and4 year old share christmas . it winter here so they ride it through house all time . my son really struggled 2 wheel bikes because typical bike easily crashes when you turn handle bars too hard . this bike made so turning radius very small . bike light enough he just picks it up little make big turn . no problem . he goes sailing through house now no crashing . once weather good enough go outside he going ball . he definately graduate standard bike after this teaches him balance . he should able skip obnoxious training wheels altogether . my short 2 year old loves it but she go slowly because she barely reach floor . few months she should fine i'm guessing this summer she'll sailing it . great fun . unfortunately price very hard swallow . i found one sale through design website so i could manage it . if money won't bankrupt your budget or you save it , it worth it	1
this may ' outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it big , it ugly , but functions make fattest swiss army knife sit corner sobbing jealousy . overall , i like it but there couple things sound better than they . timepiece : outstanding . it hh : mm :ss dd: mmm , course , year setting avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying modern digital watch . stopwatch lap function ( not i ever use lap function , but i'm sure someone interested ) . countdown timer run up 24 hour countdown ( very easy set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos alarms , this one loudest watch alarms i've heard , i've missed too many watch alarms not appreciate this . altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind neat . over four days , my bedroom went 100m above sea level 25 below sea level ( maps , 40m asl ) . not surprising because it driven barometer , i never recalibrated it , but graphic demonstration importance calibrating it when you want/need i t.t he barometer : yup , it barometer . part i like little display shows rising/falling trend , especially this always active ( even normal ' time ' mode ) . thermometer : take watch off get accurate reading sensor too close wris t.t he compass : easily best ' special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough orienteering , not surveying ) , easy use . it programmed declination , but knowing me , i'd forget reset it , so i declination hard way . sighting notches small but servicable . spirit level bubble unique among digital watch compasses suunto , greatly enhances accuracy confidence compass . outstanding wrist compass . package : big . really , really big . but controls very easy use seem fairly resistant accidental button pressing ( problem me other watches ) . battery shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but hatch , so you don't need take it jeweller get it replaced without ruining water resistance . display large characters high contrast back ground , display light just right , readible , even , glare free , but not emergency flashlight . personally , i'm going swap resin band velcro strap , but stock strap isn't bad , just not great . overall , not watch office or suit but very good watch , compass barometer , what you could expect thermometer altimeter . well designed , thought-out , manufactured , but really big .	1

i purchased this knife $4 cheaper than its usual amazon listing price amazon friday sale . i looking kershaw knives awhile , following incident my building parking garage ( woman accosted , pocketbook stolen ) , it seemed like perfect time buy . " rainbow " titanium-coating color might bother some men , but i'm woman , so i don't mind color knife . i would preferred black-on-black , but this too good deal pass up . safety lock looks like it might slip out safety easily , but two weeks time regular wear/use , i haven't problem . i flip knife open often ( heck , it fun ) , i wear it regularly ( what point it , if you're not prepared use it ? ) . thin attached metal " belt clip " very sturdy multipurpose ( it looks similar metal clip writing pen ) . not only i clip kninfe just inside my slacks waistband , but it clips easily inside leather pocket my purse . single finger flip-open mechanism beyond belief - very easy use , exceptionally fast accurate . locking mechanism ( keeps blade place ) extremely solid , worked without flaw . when i'm walking anyplace suspicious myself , i hold knife " ready flip open " position my hand , held down my side . knife nearly invisible position , so i don't stand out " oh my god , she carrying knife ! " however , someone intent criminal act just might notice , avoid me altogether . great knife personal safety . lastly , like other reviews point out , these knives sharp . i don't use mine open letters , boxes typical pocket knife activities ( i believe would gum it up , slow opening speed knife ) , so i anticipate blade should good , long life my care .	1

overall this great little knife . it opens fast , very sharp holds it edge well feels good your hand . liner lock great . i used some others absolutely hated them because they so hard operate . this one smooth silk located great position . very nicely designed . i make few changes which required going out buying torx screwdriver . first , i reversed pocket clip because it came facing opposite direction i used my spyderco knives . second , safety go . i found it slipped " " position its own so knife not open when you expected it hard disengage quickly . not because it difficult operate , rather it tiny hard find blind . if you like safety though , it definitely prevent blade opening accidentally . speaking safety ... knife arrives razor sharp . i opened my package promptly sliced finger badly enough leave scar . tension blade under requires some force overcome gives it different feel when closing knife regular lockback . sure you fingers nowhere near blade . i am now habit disengaging lock closing pressing back blade against my thigh	1
when i used lighter , less dense mats they would sometimes bunch up or move around during flowing vinyasa practice . if my toe caught mat , edge would flip over require adjustment . also , they not cushion very well . addition , lesser mats wore out quickly replaced . when doing poses like side-arm balance , my foot would slip off end regular length mat i would fall out pose . extra-long manduka mat , none these issues problem . mat solid dense , stays put floor no matter what i . it cushions really well , but because it so dense it no problem balance or move mat ( not mushy ) . i beat daylights out these mats they still look great . durability outstanding , they show no signs wearing out . ever . extra length allows me move confidence , knowing i won't run out room or slip off mat . additional benefit long mat it allows you change your starting position mat somewhat , so small area worn your feet not same every practice . other words , you spread wear over larger area make it last even longer . surface plenty sticky normal yoga , if you hot yoga class or sweat lot you likely want towel anyway . no complaints stickiness . weight , it seems if you big enough need extra-long mat you probably plenty strong enough carry it around . it ain't heavy , it best yoga mat i've ever seen .	1

gotta say i love this step even more so deal : not only you get step , but you also get four raising-blocks * * step-workout dvd -- all under $50 !!! i think that bargain compared buying pro-equipment ( i think it $70-80 pro step $40-50 two raising blocks , plus $15 dvd ... that , like , $140-150 ! ) . step * * smaller than steps you're probably used gym , but it not * * much smaller -- i would say it 25% shorter length-wise . it gotta though , i mean it at-home step so they're making it more storable . i guess if you're big person it might little frustrating first , but i don't see how you couldn't adjust it . then again , i'm 5'2 petite so me it perfect size ! haha : pthe dvd pretty good . it pretty simple , basic stepping though , so if you're advanced stepper you'll probably get bored real fast . however , it get you sweat little , so it not complete waste . if not stepping , though , keep it abs workout -- omg it amazing !! only 10 minutes it really makes you want commit stomach suicide . haha which good thing because next day your tummy sore but flat . :) but really , it good dvd , especially those lazy days you know you need workout but don't want ( least not too hard ) . lolbuy this kit , it * great * deal it'll get you shape ! :	1

i've owned three pairs these so far , they're easily best gloves i've ever used . i previously only used unpadded gloves , padding palm seemed little thick first . padding make it more difficult get solid grip some exercise machines also large rubber grips them ( lat pulldown bars , example ) , but that trade off excellent support protection when using gloves machines uncovered metal grips . i found these gloves more durable than other non-padded harbinger gloves i've worn . gloves safely washed air dryed , advertised . my only complaint regard wear unreinforced leather where my thumb meets padding palm seems wear out before rest glove . every pair i owned eventually wear hole this particular area .	1

just 3 weeks ago , i came here looking reviews tony little gazelle freestyle , read mixed reviews . however , most encouraging , i thought it sounded like thing me . i now used gazelle less than 2 weeks , already seen results ! this no lie -- i lost 2 inches waist , 2 hips , 2 abdomin , 2 thighs . i'm just freaked you may , but i'm telling you , this honest truth ! i discouraged i not seeing any results scales lately , needed change things up , so i'd see something move again . this gazelle it me . this time , i'm only up 30 minutes day , 1-3/4 miles ... i'm still work progress . but these results no lie . just think how much results i'll see when i stay longer ! they advertise it low impact overall machine , it truly . i rheumatoid arthritis , fibromyalgia , so i looking something i could wouldn't hurt me . i honestly say i get full workout this machine ... oh , i forgot mention , also 1 inch arms . so , that total 9 inches 2 weeks . this best machine i've ever used , ( we also exercise bike , ab lounge , which i've not used last 2 weeks all , cause i getting such good workout gazelle ) i'm so happy i found it . i thank you people , users amazon.com, coming here posting your reviews , making it easy me know which machine buy . mine exact picture above , folds up . i also love feature . it not problem just fold it up lean it against wall beside my bed after each use . therefore , i've still got lots walking space beside my bed .	1

bike arrived fine condition , no problems bent or rusty parts like other people reported . it really easy assemble . once i assembled it i tried it out found it made really annoying noise wheel went around - if gears scraping against something . so , i undid all screws ( pain ) opened plastic-enclosed base . there bracket meant hold pulse wires out way , but adhesive it worn off or something it just kind hanging , would interfere gears . so i taped it side , closed plastic up , . since then bike worked really well . i wish there more ability move it back - it good length me but i see how someone taller could trouble it . seat not terribly comfortable , which gets problem longer rides , but it fixable pillow or cushion . console great - all information displayed all time . plenty resistance . overall there some problems it , but under two hundred dollars , i suppose i can't complain too much . definitely worth money	1

i bought this lifeline recently it excellent addition my home gym equipment . i'm not person who travels back forth gym each day . i also not like paying arm leg expensive pieces workout equipment eventually become expensive coat racks . this workout solution low tech it get . i agree previous reviews below -- you could almost make this one yourself . it consists strip mesh webbing -- like seatbelt material ; two adjustable , quick locking clips ; handles made webbing plastic tubes ; piece plastic tubing locks jungle gym into place when door shut . equipment simple , but sets up seconds . clips adjust quickly incredibly secure . it so simple -- but it really works . emphasis instruction sheet dvd came it , upper body strength . you chin ups -- regulating height , you work up lifting part your body weight full body weight . me , this best part jungle gym . my chin ups/pull ups improved remarkably using device . body rows , push ups , fly push ups also possible . using jungle gym , pushups take new dimension fuller range motion ( like atlas pushup)and given instability webbing , you also get more core workout . you use webbing balance well maintain better technique when doing squats . you also make exercises more challenging using fitness ball . you abdominal crunches holding handles lifting your feet floor . some exercises ( full body rows dips ) difficult when attached door lifeline suggests draping jungle gym over tree limb so you achieve truly vertical workout . i not yet tried using this over tree limb ... however , i able perform dips some creativity while attached door but it not easy . this not full fitness solution . but when used conjunction weights exercise bands , it really makes home gym complete . i searched pull up bar long time removable , but none current offerings fit odd sized door frames moldings my 99 year old house . jungle gym worked . given ability pull ups varying difficulty , it also improved my ability pull ups/chin ups over short period time . downside device it requires sturdy door door frame . i would leery using device door not close securely lock or if you worried integrity your house construction . remember , jungle gym strong enough hold your body weight , but door it connected able same . if not , you find yourself flat your back new home improvement project . remember too , when your feet touching ground you pull towards door , weight decreases you pull . this not defect device , it just physics situation . ( free weights , weight stable throughout your range motion . exercise bands weight increases band lengthens . ) also , this great device weight/circuit training , but not really aerobic solution . jungle gym , few exercise bands ideal travel . i used mine three lifeline exercise bands ( 2 r6s 1 r8 ) , exercise band door attachment lifeline triple grip handles . this yielded gym weighed less than two pounds , fit my suitcase easily allowed variety body weight resistance exercises	1
just purchased this chair 3 wks ago so far so good ! i use it almost every morning 15 minutes while i watch news . needed chair like this because i'm starting get gut my pants getting too tight . i hate exercizing definitely don't will/motivation go gym consistently . i bought ultra version because i needed able hide it away when it isn't used . once folded up ( 4 1/2 inches tall - 29 inches wide - 39 inches long ) it fits very nicely under my couch . it fairly easy fold up/unfold but it could easier which why i gave it 4 instead 5 stars . there 2 bungee type straps need unhooked , 2 curved handle bars need removed ( simple twist knobs ) , one stabilizer bar undone ( simple twist knob ) fold this unit down . removing parts folding unit takes less than 2 minutes . not difficult just wish it easier . overall , i would definitely make this purchase again knowing what i now know .	1

many years ago , acquaintance mine property manager low-rent motel . one morning , while he back office behind front desk , two men jumped over counter started beating door . he could see them , but they could not see him through privacy security glass . men continued beat door , trying get . he waited inside patiently , his glock pistol . soon door fell men ran inside , he shot them both . they turned out high school teenagers who trying break obtain crack money . i recalled many community dissaproved his actions . it turned out he plenty time leave through back door call help . when asked why he kill them , he simply said , " i own life anyone who threatens my personal safety . i it because it my right i could . " fortunately , it considered self-defense . i remembered he always carried short stick , attached his keys . it not until many years later i finally figured out what little wooden stick . i became interested self-defense decided buy baton myself . this my first kubaton . i concerned because this one pointed end . pointed end , although not sharp compared blade weapon , easily punch hole through four layers very heavy cordura cloth little effort my part . i afraid if ever i use it , amount damage it cause its design would make it hard me claim i acting self-defense . i bought kubaton , same manufacturer , flat end . replacement baton exactly like this one , except end flat . i tested replacement it also punch hole through heavy canvas . but it takes lot more force so . more importantly , average person , it looks less aggressive than this one . if i use it self-defense , presiding judge or jury might less likely think it weapon . if you not concerned perception , then get this pointed baton . if it easily punch hole through layers cordura cloth ( same material used heavy duty outdoor bags , outerwear , hiking shoes ) , it easily injure attacker who might wearing several layers clothes . but please understand some might put this same category they would knife . might make it difficult claim self-defense , event you use it protect yourself . my old acquaintance well-versed knowledgeable . he not only knew how use his weapons , but he also understood where line self-defense assault . he knew just limits what he could get away it use deadly force defend himself . this pointed baton , made out hardened aluminum alloy , probably such person . my friend tip:here tip old acquaintance mine . keys themselves part weapon . you make them more effective , which increase damage baton . take some keys you no longer use . any metal key would , but try find different sizes . four them would . take keys grinder ( even rasp ) sharpen teeth each key . now , put four keys keyring your regular keys . face sharp keys opposite directions . meaning two should face one way , but other two should face opposite direction . idea when you swing baton like flail , sharpened keys would cut into attacker flesh . keys faced opposite directions so you major damage regardless which direction you swinging . citan experiment : please keep mind you also cut your hand . i tried this technique . i wore pair leather work gloves swung against wooden post . sharpened keys bounced back hit back my hand . without gloves , my hand would gotten badly cut . what it worth , i swung against large watermelon keys didn't bounce back though . i don't anything else add here , except maybe it might good swing against attacker fleshy parts prevent keys rebounding . i'm not expert though . but it fun trying it watermelon	1
let me start out saying this rower not perfect . it , fact , flawed . you may noticed , i still gave it five star rating i try explain reasons doing so . reading reviews here , i noticed two complaints : one pointing out this machine doesn't perform same standards professional gym rowers other regarding assembly this machine . i researched various rowers available market quite while . i spent lot time effort driving around trying various models before purchasing this one simply because i tend informed shopper who wants get value his money . during my research , it became very evident my favorite rower water rower followed schwinn windrigger - both extremely smooth their operation . both also $1000 ! any rate , these sophisticated rowers gave me benchmark against which compare integrity it should surprise nobody integrity doesn't really come close performance either other two rowers . it shouldn't , given it substantially lower price . this exactly what it important considering this rower : you cannot expect get professional-grade rower such low price just like you cannot expect get comfort performance rolls royce if you buying honda . nonetheless , what you get integrity well within parameters what i would expect $200 . machine reasonably stable , it reasonably smooth , it provide great workout . noise level also not too bad actually seems less than windrigger . electric monitor basic provides speed , time , calories burned , distance . it also provides option continuously cycles through all these functions so you cant track all them during your workout . seat comfortable slides smoothly track whole thing actually pretty professional look it doesn't appear flimsy . i also quite surprised level resistance this rower provides - it much more than schwinn windrigger . addition , resistance adjusted pretty easily . i think my only disappointment air-flow created during operation not channeled toward person using machine aid cooling him/her down - but this certainly flaw i live . potential buyer you should also aware rower tends slide across smooth surfaces such tile - which means you need non-slip mat under it if you intend use it such surface . i said before , i also read least one person problem assembling this rower . i cannot confirm this problem . assembly extremely easy quick - even though instructions not greatest . however , it should quite clear most people where parts go what needs hooked up where . winding up chain onto gear wheel breeze , too . all you need unhook it retracting cord you hooked it up one or two steps before . i suppose person who wrote instructions could switched these steps make it more logical - but i said , instructions not great . taking all these factors into account , i think integrity provides fantastic product very low price . it exactly what it supposed it so surprisingly good manner . however , any product , your expectations should realistic if they , you not disappointed . if you expect gym-quality machine - you not get what you looking . if , however , you looking basic functional rower without all bells whistles high-end products , then this probably best deal you get	1

( i used it stuck traffic it also good stress reliever ) if i it again , i would probably not bought blue unless you very light grip , probably started red . i started use red black . red just right me , challenging fingers i am working my way use black consistently . although it doesn't seem like it first , black challenging hand fingers give good workout . just remember this mainly fingers hand exercise so very easy use gripping , challenge working out fingers . it not like using regular heavy hand grippers . it increased my hand strength grip just it me using it during course day without planned workouts . great product , excellent finger or hand exercise , good quality . also bought dmm products , great price fast shipping	1

i recently purchased pair gripmaster hand finger exercisers order help build forearm strength . i unsure which tension would appropriate , i bought one each light/blue ( 5 lbs . tension ) medium/red ( 7 lbs . tension ) grips . i've them little more than week now , i just love , love , love them ! perhaps that little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up exercise accessories , but i really enjoy grips . i leave one out my desk all times , get little work here there when i stop read document or whatnot . gripmaster exercisers different conventional grips you either work your entire hand once , or each finger individually ( great guitar players , i've heard ! ) . one side features four small levers , each its own spring , squeezed together or one time . plastic flip side molded together so you work your whole hand one unit . black rubber cushion removable , you place it either side grip . it awesome idea , allows maximum versatility ! just reference , i'm female , relatively good shape , but painfully little forearm strength ( my biceps huge years tae bo , though ! ) . 7 lb . medium/red grip do-able , but challenging . 5 lb . light/blue grip , other hand , makes much easier workout ; i oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things , i only feel it after number reps . if you're female not great shape , you'll want start out light/blue grips ( or even extra light/yellow ones ) , work your way up . out-of-shape guys probably get away medium/red ones start . if you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength , don't even both lighter tensions - skip ahead medium/red or heavy/black . although i've only owned my gripmasters week or two , can't personally vouch their durability , they seem sturdy well-crafted . my fianc brother , amateur boxer guitar player , used his years without problem , so i faith i'll squeezing these babies well into 2015 ! - kelly garbato , couch potato turned fitness fanati	1

i own this cooler , circa 1968 . it bombproof looks like it survived tour vietnam , but we haul this bad boy out each summer because it job . cam lock lid keeps it flying free if jarred or jostled ; this very good thing if you take it fishing your catch inside . construction good enough last near 40 years use before considering replacement . it really survive many seasons use , which more than you say many fragile thermoplastic knockoffs . there few camping or summertime essentials universally adopted , but coleman steel cooler one . bring it your next outing , even if you boring cans diet coke inside , people stop check it out . -fred	1
this really good product . gym owner trainer southern calif . over 20 years i've seen used few products this one ranks near top . most fats m.c.t.s used energy , not make it taste better ! protein needs fat properly utilized body ! carbs sugars low , which make this true lean gainer . keep your protein high , your carbs moderate get some good healthy fats like flax or fish oil you've got diet grow some muscle	1

i bought both medium heavy tension gripmasters . medium ( red ) one not much challenge me . i'm man average build , i actually bought these because i starting weight training gym i wanted more grip strength my hands stronger forearms . i'd say if you looking individual finger strength , such playing instrument , then red gripmaster might enough resistance . but i use black one much more whole hand strength . product comes guide containing instructions variety exercises . i would also recommend visiting gripmaster website , they more complete list exercises , recommendations different sports	1
after much deliberation self debate , i bought this bike someone other than amazon . ( i spend 2 months doing research , then needed " immediate satisfaction " comes purchasing walk-in store ) . i've it since right after thanksgiving , think it one better purchases i've made . it seems fan-type exercise bike you get fewer bells whistles , but more strength reliability . i've one treadmill one " fancy " exercise bike die after just few months . while this machine doesn't play music or show me videos try make me believe i'm riding through french country side , it feel like it might just last forever .	1
let me start saying this wonderful product . small , light , well constructed ( they feel like they last forever ) . you carry them you , allowing workout your fingers office , home or wherever you find suitable . i bought four different color-coded gripmasters : black/heavy , red/medium , blue/light , yellow/extra light . i only found resistance red black ones useful me , but my wife loves blue yellow ones . it great buy because their high quality affordable price . product comes foldable instruction booklet where you find details six different exercises : - trigger pinch . this one simulates movement squeezing trigger , it isolates index finger enhanced strength coordination . - gross grasp . this one strengthens fingers , thumb , wrist forearm firm grip . - hook position . this one strengthens longer muscles forearm wrist while stretching smaller muscles hand greater motion endurance . - tip tip pinch . this exercise strengthens specific fingers , thumb , smaller hand muscles forearm greater control endurance . - wrist flexion . it strengthens wrist forearm muscles . - key pinch . strengthens thumb index finger greater stability coordination . gripmaster website you find more exercises different activities sports . if you looking crush hands when handshaking this not product you , but if you need finger strength , control , endurance coordination you right place	1

billy great , full energy enthusiam . i get great results his workout much better than any other instructor . my family get great results his workout . his customer service rep helpful . however , i strongly , strongly recommend ordering your taebo products through amazon . i've doing business amazon many years placed over 150 orders . i never , never once any problems my orders amazon . when i questions , it amazing not only how quick amazon reply but give long thorough kind explanation . because they reply within day take so much time response , it shows they truly care you want give you best service possible . i've never found customer service this very high rare quality . november 2005 , after ordering billy bands official billy bank website . i sent package , without my permission company contained billy energy formula supplements . it 14 day delayed bill 31.85 . i upset this sent without me knowing but here worse part . i contacted customer service , gentleman told me don't worry you haven't billed just send us back package we'll credit you $5 into your account shipping , packaging , mailing cost you pay out your own pocket items sent back . within few days i send product i never requested back . twice phone once email 3 different cust rep i told i would receive $5 credit my bank account within 7 10 days . i already upset this matter but it wasn't big concern . however , 2 weeks well over 10 days i never received $5 credit my account . but there charge taken their company without my permisson or authorization my own personal bank account $8.97 . few days later $8.97 put back into my account . when i contacted company this their reply : thank you your recent e-mail . we apologize inconvenience . our records show your vitamin shipment 14 day delay billing cycle ( i sent item i never wanted back 7 days not over 14 day limit ) . this means when charges actually went through , you only charged small portion amount showed invoice ( i kept copy nowhere invoice this stated ) . you received credit shipping handling plus 5.00 dollars ship it back too . this means , when charge vitamins actually went through you only charged 8.97 . this also refund you received , amount paid ( again since item sent back within 14 days i shouldn't charged nowhere invoice this stated i would only charged small portion ) . so basically they sent me product i never requested . told me they would give me some money product sent back . took money my bank account without me knowing paid me back my own money they stolen . sum it up , business amazon !	-1
i got few great chuckles out this thing . just get kinda grossweird using it over nad over again . but great one no matter	1

i write lot reviews books , but seldom write one product . however ; i feel like breaking my trend reviewing this lite . i , like i suppose , just everyone else , keep looking lite right all people , all purposes . if it exists , i haven't seen it ye t.t he plain ordinary battery flashlight remained essentially same since i got my first kid , 60 years ago . they often fail you when they needed , batteries expensive , but overall they serve purpose . 50 years ago , hand held magneto lite appeared . long you kept squeezing it , it gave light comparable normal flashlght . it similar lite sold use bicycle , where it powered turning wheel . however ; soon bicycle stopped , light went out . some reason , they disappeared off market . few years ago , new almost similar magneto lite appeared . biggest difference , it made lot noise when squeezed . they don't appear very popular . this faraday principle lite made very popular due tv ads , more because what they don't say than what they say , many people disappointed upon getting one . ad flouts idea it seen up mile . sowhat !, we learned military , lit cigarette seen hundreds yards away night . so , if that not you looking , it meaningless you . fact , it very poor casting light suface more than few feet away . this purpose , it can't begin compete normal flashlight ; if that what you want , forget it . matter fact , those little led keychain lites just much ; picked up buck " dollar stores " . they last couple years , weigh next nothing , you'll always one you . i leave them around house they handy look something dark spot , or occasional time you need find circuit breaker panel or find your way power failure . these lites so weak you can't assume they meet your expectations store , or watching tv ad . my advice try compare key chain lite , one might serve you well other , huge difference cost .	1
i like this product great taste i don't need blender mix it - shaker cup all you need so it very easy get ready quickly . i've using it 2 weeks actually lost body fat so no complaints here ( started 14% , 12% now ) give it try , really only way tell your yourself . it easy enough adjust how thick you want your shake , just add more water thinner drink . 2 scoops 10oz water thin fluid , my personal preference	1
this pillow small compact . it just right size traveling camping it stays fluffed through night	1
i recieved my product record time i very pleased assembly quick simple just like box said !!! i so pleased i purchased diego bike dora bike !!	1
very nice bike , especially sale price . it warning inside box : this product contains products known state california cause cancer . not sure what they referring . this second toy i see it . perhaps someone shed some light	1
i bought this my son two half years age , even seat all way down , his feet barely make ground he looks intimidated . he too young . his big brother , age seven , thought it hoot , wheeled around confidently , but he too big . quality construction excellent , assembly easy . orange wheelcovers come off so you get valve stems put air tires . we also kettler trike they're terrific , too . get trike age 2-3 . get this age 3-4 . spoil them rotten	1
i finally chance wear this glove it truely no numbness glove . my hand felt fine after 15 miles riding . my old gloves my hands would start bothering me after 1 mile riding ! you can't beat price these gloves either . i highly recommend these gloves	1
one thing i really like there no plastic or rubber taste first use . it holds enough long bike ride cold all way end ride . it feels good your back too . it helps this florida heat . cons : mouth piece hard hold onto because 180 degree angle . it would easier mouth piece . i looking replacement .	1
after sweating slipping many vinyasa class ( even " non-slip " mat ) , friend recommended this yoga towel . this product saved my yoga practice ! it take one or two classes get used , but once you , you off non-slip yoga bliss . plus , well-placed circle top mat gives you visual focus stay centered . thank you yogitoes	1

we've this 2 years now it still working just great . i am truly amazed how much better i feel after good stretch it very helpful chronic backpain	1
this strong , stable , all features tables three times its price . it helps relieve my back pain . i think it help even more i use it more	1
this inversion table decent piece equipment . it sturdy , not hard assemble relatively inexpensive compared similar units . it feel good your back , but don't expect hang upside down very long , it take some time get used blood rushing your head which cut short time your back feel decompressed or stretched out .... whatever term you want use . some reviewers mentioned ankle brackets uncomfortable ; i didn't find them too bad , mostly it take some time get used held upside down your ankles . if you kind frail bones , then i could see this problem because you holding your body weight your ankles . while it not designed go totally vertical , you get there walking your hands back floor . instructions say it lock into place if you go vertical , but i haven't found true , maybe other peoples but mine doesn't . all all , if you really sure you want inversion table don't want invest lot money into it , then this table fit your needs . one recommendation : if you ,... try using inversion table friends or store couple times make sure this something you really use .	1
this classic wiffle bat , fluorescent yellow 32 inches long . lot people try sell you black-and-white bat , or red bat flares out end . you must decline these bats , politely but firmly . wiffle bat stood test time , continue so long after imitators gone . most people know wiffle bat ideal hitting aptly-named wiffle ball , but few newcomers know bonus features : 1 ) if your opponent throws hanging curveball you make solid contact , ball slide down bat even you hitting it . result monstrous home run makes whistling sound it disappears into your cranky neighbor yard . 2 ) lower part wiffle bat textured grip . nice . 3 ) base bat little hole it , when bat waved around , makes cool , low-pitched whistle not unlike hum light saber . highly recommended anyone ball , yard , friend	1
i found this product ( hydration pack ) every thing i read it i am very satisfied it ..	1
this home plate solid good quality last many years backyard baseball games	1
it hard find tricycle rubber treads wheels . most trikes big wheels hard plastic wheels which slip concrete when kid pedals ... i liked this one , it easy put together , except front decorative plate dora it , but it wasn't necessary my daughter doesn't know who dora so i just didn't put it ... trike small enough really petite or young child , which why i bought it . we bigger trike ( radio flyer ) which no where near small enough our 2 year old ... my only complaint bar seat attached connects rear axle just little bit loose-fitting but it doesn't seem causing problem . very good trike overall	1
ok , i should first say i'm not great golfer . i started playing few weeks ago , bought these online because they looked like great deal . customer mine invited me out golf outting , club rental fee course more than i wanted pay , i'd most likely doing this again ( it not really game , it now ? ) i figured these would pay themselves 2 or 3 outtings . i'm not great golfer , i don't know much clubs . but , these seemed swing ok , my buddies kind impressed considering what i paid , i didn't too badly . nothing came broken , nothing broke course , drivers decent range , irons they're job . if you're tall like i am , you'll find irons little short need get grips extended . i'm 6 ' 4 " . i'll keep these until my game deems me worthy something nicer	1
this purchased xmas present my wife . she uses it daily claims it helped her chronic back pain . table excellently made . it very sturdy ! design well-engineered . it perfectly balanced when set up correct body height . very good buy	1

lanyards whistles purchased christmas gift which well received . thank you	1
pink color this bag not same shade pink 1/4 " extra thick deluxe high density yoga mat . it looks pink/purple , yet mat hot pink . however , it fits mat very nicely . also , it very light weight , it very easy fold up when not used . even though it no extra pockets cell phone stuff , i think it better than canvas bags which quite heavy . i bought this bag mat same time , so shipping rate not too bad . course , it would better if it cheaper	1
i would normally wear totes abercrombie or hollister . when i saw black crazy dots i thought it looked really cool ! this best backpack i ever found i wish i figured out long time ago . bit you know what they say it better late then never finding out . overall jansport mad great , durable , cute backpace . i reccomend it anyone needs new , stylish backpack	1

pump came ball easy use , i shocked how quickly i able blow up ball it . not saying it didn't hurt my arm , but i'm quite out shape - hence fitness ball ! it really just took few minutes , it blown up . i little confused first how fit pump into hole , but once i got figured out , it went very smoothly . ball itself very easy use , it works really well . " fitness guide " it comes nothing more than small piece paper three or four exercises drawn out . i thinking it going dvd or something . $15 though , i can't complain . i think it completely worth $15 i paid it .	1
these best pair weightlifting gloves i owned . they last forever , not tear . also great batting biking	1

i've riding wooden boards over 2 years now . i saw this board sale thought it way too cheap full fiberglass/foam board - but i decided take risk give it try . it major upgrade my wooden boards . this , i waveskim or sandride . it very light weighing only 5 lbs , mild rocker , comes limited lifetime warranty . it not going perform well $200 - $300 namebrand boards like victoria , exile , zap , etc . ; but price i paid i'm very happy	1
i am very satisfied quality also supply chain management . thanks	1
like chive , this knife nice small package that deceptively stabby . sure , it looks innocent , but how much blade you want your eye ? hypothetically speaking , course . i would never indicate you should stab people this knife . never ever . high points sleek design , flawless assisted opening , light weight . i problems thumb studs assisted opening knives , so i am very pleased this index opening . safety-conscious , there safety lock keep blade opening your pants . not it , but just case i guess . leek perfect knife people small hands ; i assisted opening definite bonus . too many assisted opening knives too bulky my hand , or too powerful when it snaps open ( kershaw tactical blur , example ) . leek firmly snaps into place without " recoil " light small enough people small hands easily use . but don't fooled its innocent appearance . this knife deadly little package should not underestimated	1
knife sleek great profile . i love speedsafe function it . blade lock bit stiff , but i suppose that just so it doesn't slide open accident	1
one i ordered seemed black so its plus me since i like black knives ... i guess i cant really call it knife or sword it would stack up more small hunting machete . very well build light but strong . recomend it camping	1
i ordered this mat when i started morning exercise class includes yoga . i like size , but especially thickness . past experience , i know how uncomfortable it doing sit-ups without sufficient padding . this mat plenty ! i couldn't more satisfied	1
i use basement floor which concrete , but there carpet over padding . really makes difference using this mat . very comfortable	1

i love this trailer . when i started looking trailer , i saw how expensive some other brands like burley chariot . i thought i would spend lot money get decent one . but talking women my bike club , i got many recommendations instep because you get them reasonable price they durable . so i bought this one , it very easy put together . no tools needed . i love how it not pain rear use ! it attaches bike very easily . i also bought second coupler through instep my husband bike . so we easily switch trailer bike bike even mid-ride if we ever needed . it collapses almost completetely storage which nice thing . my son who 15 months old almost 30 lbs uses it seems comfortable since he loves riding it .	1
this sword awesome replica terms actual size sephiroth . only thing i think takes away sword handle plastic wrapped black cloth . when sword held outstretched , it become very heavy lot pressure put handle . despite handle cloth , sword overall massive amazing behold . great collectible any ff goru	1
much i love anime , stuff this sword actually isnt real enough any ' swordplay ' . it hard accept it isnt truly real , but it isnt hard accept after you get all fanboy-ish fantasy nonsense arranged properly your mind , albeit thats only rather obvious ' con ' it . other than its truly wicked artifact , ff7 fans its almost like piece game memoriablia , also wonderful thoughts weilding blade similar who could quite possibly greatest villain all time . btw , weilding thing quite feat , someone short arms struggle getting sword out themselves(but thats hardly my problem my arms sorta lanky ) rules physics . last but not least , your official piece property ( after you drooled or allowed some other bodily fluid somehow leak onto it ) , just remember 2 important things .... #1 ) take care it , rust constant threat any metal or combination metals , #2 ) don't let size it go your head , also try keep it home . i dont think local authorities would like pull someone over typical traffic violation only discover they carrying blade over 4 feet long their vehicle . just word advice	1
such detail , such fine work . this near exact replica , down tiniest details ! it shame blade isn't 7 or 8 feet long like real thing , but makes it all more better ! weildable masamune !!! this makes me wanna buy it !!	1
this glove fits very well comfortable wear . it seems breathe relatively well secured velcro straps . i'm very happy mine , purposes everyday workout glove . would recommend	1
i wear them riding my bike work back . i work out doors handle alot money , they perfect counting money , keeping my hands warm riding my bike . they well made strong	1
i found assembly this bike very easy . you'll need ratchet , 2 sockets . open end wrench , 2 hex wrenches , 40 minutes . handlebars , seat , front tire , pedals . air tires . then final adjustments seat handlebars . that it . my brakes gears needed no adjustments . reviewer who trouble must truely gotten oddball item . my guess his cycle returned item re-shipped parts thrown haphazardly back box . after 35 years riding racers upright riding position take some getting used me . still i found bike ride smooth comfortable . my amazon gold box discount free super saver shipping this great bike great price .	1
much better than conventional round mirrors which only slightly larger than dental mirror . many cases i still needed twist around see - no pleasure bad back . it not issue this mirror .	1
our daughter loves this pizza set . it wonderful pretend play , our daughter loves pretend take our orders mix match toppings create her own custom slices ( pepperoni only daddy , mushroom broccoli mommy , please ) . we're also using it learn very basic math skills . it helps her visualize 1/2 1/4 , understand simple addition subtraction ( " if you three broccoli florets take one away , how many left ? " ) . this nice , quiet travel toy . it made fabric , it soft lightweight , velcro helps keep all pieces together . we just returned long road trip this toy didn't lose single piece	1
we so looking forward using this over spring summer this year . i purchased bocce ball sets past this one sure heft make it comparable proper sets , but without huge price .	1
i bought this some skepticism , read other reviews gave it low marks , also bought thule products past cursed them i tried assembling installing them , what missing pieces like . happily , this box fine . it seem flimsy when you're assembling it , it even seems way when it open top car . it seems engineered light possible , which it , unnerving until you get it fastened down locked closed . assembly : it awkward . it took two us , me my 2 year old ! seriously . it bit hairy one person get it right , since you match hinges sides " clam shell " , their fit doesn't seem quite right until you tighten them up well . still , it went ok , 20 minutes me , far better than thule roof racks i installed some years back , where i dealing bent missing parts . if you this alone , you need brace it well angle you hook top bottom together . much easier two people . installation : dead easy factory roof rack . ( we pontiac aztek . ) there no need buy additional brackets , though when viewing ads this , you might think so first glance . package includes 4 u-brackets which attach your roof racks held inside hand-swivel bolts ( whatever they're called ) . one thing i added while doing installation put duct tape over inside holes u-brackets . there several holes each sequence , you only use two out 4 or 5 ; others exposed . covering tape might help keep spray out . performance : pretty good ! we drove 2300 miles this unit , which 300 driving rain . during worst rain , we dampness some droplets water bottom front inside , but gear sitting up ridges fine - bag front damp but not wet . if you cloth bags press very bottom , i'd put them plastic if you'll hitting heavy rain ( ours very heavy , 70 mph driving speed ) . we noticed increase wind noise high speeds , our rough tests , it knocked 2 mpg off our gas mileage 75 mph , but 50 mph stretch several hundred miles we couldn't tell difference . removal takes literally five minutes . you undo ( hand ) four pairs swivel bolts , lift it right off roof . reinstallation same . overall , we're extremely happy it very glad we bought it	1
i've my kurt kinetic road machine since 2001 it never leaked . i put average 1200 miles per winter it it always reliable , relatively quiet , better feel than any non-fluid trainer . road machine pro even heavier flywheel so offers even better feel , i'd say . best thing you could read reviews other sites . try couple out local bike shop then buy best . after all my initial reviews ongoing knowledge bike trainers , kurt still best .	1
i pretty soft skin , these don't give me blisters after wearing hour or two . they work ok rain , occasional washing managed not reek	1
i bought my xtreme 2 bowflex because time they offered free shiping . but since amazon ships this item bowflex anyway its still great deal here . even after month using this machine i can't believe how well its made how many exercises you . it not take up much room either . i looked home gyms far wide me i could not find better value price quality . i also comes instructions diet plan help you get bowflex body .	1
i ton research before buying x2 . i run treadmill 3 or 4 days week ( 12-15 miles week ) work up good sweat , my lower body pretty lean . however , almost 40 , not trained weights since high school , i felt i needed start doing some weight/resistance training , particularly my upper body . well , after 3 weeks , i tell huge difference after using this machine . i'm also glad i got x2 instead because ability work out faster without pully changes . i also able gradually increase weight so i'm going buy two 50 rod extensions . i highly recommend this machine anyone who doesn't feel comfortable gym , and/or just doesn't time go . i small kids able hit this machine 5:30 am when everyone still asleep huge benefit me . assembly , it fairly easy if you follow directions . only difficult part pully system - make sure you it right backbone entire system . pics instructions could little clearer . otherwise , bottom line this thing works great purchase .	1
this really nice basketball system .... but instructions very difficult follow ... it took 3 adults 3 hours put it together . i would definately recommend this product just make sure you plenty patience when it time put it together	1
this basketball hoop nice looking , sturdy perfect home use . someone else set it up me said it wasn't complicated but it take some time work . i take notes other reviewers passed them person who put it together . it arrived perfect condition , all parts , arrived time . overall , we very pleased	1
this excellent product money . we researched quite bit before we bought it read all reviews amazon . we little worried putting it together becasue all negitive reviews we read . but , we didn't any trouble . it went together simply easily . we careful read all instuctions before we began kept ready few steps ahead it wasn't hard all . our kids playing non stop ever since	1

this gun ( seen under bunch different names here amazon , if they look alike , chances they're all double eagle m83 ) really impressed me day it came ( only 4 business days ship la pa ) . while i waiting battery charge , i toyed around gun . sight comes standard gun pretty handy , but it almost required remove handle part sight nearest trigger but electric sight . even then , it more showy accesory than anything because you aim higher than crosshair shows . flashlight nice addition everything well . you careful when putting strap because my friend , who bought same gun , put his strap came off , resulting gun falling ground , barrel hitting first , mock silencer broke off . my strap hasn't failed me yet , just like every other part gun . so now fun . if you plan using this gun during wars/capture flag/etc ., i strongly suggest you buy extra magazine speed loader practice reloading . gun accurate up 30 feet until it starts curve little , unless you use useful hop up system . switching lever ' normal ' ' hop up ' mode , your gun puts more backspin bbs , making them curve upwards get more distance . this great shooting people high up far away once you get aiming down . automatic function lot fun great taking out lots people during gameplay . magazine runs out fast though , so use it sparingly . i measured fps range 220-260 , depending battery power , type bbs ( . 12 gram giving highest fps ) , wind . i've used it 2 battles so far , both which 4 hours long . battery didn't even show signs slowing down , so just keep it charged you'll fine . i highly recommend this gun anyone looking impress hours upon hours fun friends . pros : -6 setting adjustable shoulder stock easily caters your shooting style . -high battery life keeps you game all day long . -gun hasn't jammed once over 8 hours use . -hop up system great extra distance . -looks pretty sweet . -accessories ( flashlight , electronic sight , extra barrel ) fun addition gun . -powerful , but not too powerful children all ages . -realistic look weight gives you feel actual m16 . ------------------------------------------- cons : -only accurate up 30 feet until bbs begin curve . -plastic screw-on barrel chance breaking if dropped barrel . -sight complicated until you get used gun . -reloading annoying , but not problem if you practice	1
obviously this machine doesn't speed dial , so you control speed . you direct your own workout really drive make your own workout . other than - it easy set up , fun use , job price . if you want something cheap because you can't afford " real thing " , this perfect buy	1
i just finished my first workout gazelle edge . i wanted something would make aerobic excercise convenient ( my garage ) when weather nasty -and i didn't want spend alot money . overall , it very good job what i wanted . i using very inexpensive machine similar motion many years great success . my previous machine ran track wheels , like gazelle handles arm motion(although separate foot action ) , no tension adjustment very basic computer . i literally wore this old machine out . i decided since i stuck this machine so long , i could treat myself something fancier - i knew it wouldn't become clothes hanger . i started my hunt tried several high end , fancy , expensive units , but kept saying myself .... " why i need all this stuff ? would i even use it ? " most retail stores i checked only carried things " bells whistles " , so , i searched yard sales goodwill something simple , no luck . it all too fancy ( still expensive ) or too beat up run down . anyway , i search amazon thinking if i going spend bunch money , i better know what i getting . i found gazelle , read reviews decided give it try . it seemed like many different abiliity levels happy it , price fair motion similar what i used . glad i . i think it going great . far no tension adjustment , i don't problem , maybe because i'm used it . it also seems like you get more tension arms pulling against motion your feet . my only big complaint ( why i gave 4 stars instead 5 ) speed calibration computer very " choppy " ( lack better word ) . i would going very fluid , steady pace speed reading would vary 2-3 mph period just few seconds . i tried it slow fast speeds ... always same . only one i think accurate 0 . i always used speed ( my old unit ) help me regulate my interval training . if i can't figure out " secret " getting read consistently , i guess i'll guess it . also , i don't think you should rely calorie meter correct . like reviewer mentioned , you can't sure without knowing alot other variables . but , it useful comparing one workout . ( if you write things like down . ) not complaint so much fyi . if you looking aerobic workout machine use home this should trick . just remember , like any exercise program or machine , results you get going direct result effort you put into it	1
i bought my whisperlite 1996 yet problem it . ( i think i may cleaned it once ) simmering bit trick but if you use it several times before taking it into woods you should able cook any food you take back pack . there stories these stoves going into " meltdown " during light up cold days but it always because user either over primed stove or using damaged fuel line . if you accidentally over prime not add more fuel . just let what you burn off . i never problems lighting stove or keeping it going ( although i run out fuel once ) . light very easy use . funny thing , it bit loud but you never notice until you turn it off .	1
this very comfortable , easy set up , sturdy product . it little big carry your back - we tried it . but good camping near car	1
shoes great cannot faulter them . am hanging weather cool little give them propper flogging	1
we purchased this hike we doing this year , previously this same area we serious problem ticks . this year we didn't even see any ticks so i can't say if this product would helped area . but , we see lot mosquitoes , 5 us went there total 1 bite , both days we woods . spray doesn't seem repel mosquitoes , since we saw lot them , them buzzing around us . i am not sure its killing power since i didn't see any dead mosquitoes my clothes . but i didn't see any live mosquitoes my clothes either . it kind hassle treating clothes prior trip , so i would only recommend this product if you knew you going bug infested location few days . otherwise use more convenient bug spray	1
this most adorable bike ever . my granddaughter loves it . we needed replacement defective part it immediately sent us manufacturer . great product ... great service ... great value	1
we love our new schwinn exercise bike ! i checked consumer reports this one best price ( 340.00 ) . we extremely happy fast shipping bike- although box bashed corners box open !! assembly direct not difficult except shoving back ( seat ) section into front half bike . it took all our strength , then we realized wiring cramped up inside we pull it apart again . next time we shoved two together , it slid easily we watched wires . this caution not instructions- you may even need tape wire hold it place- maybe not best design . everything else absolute peach ! seat very comfortable , monitor/display easy read , seat adjustable two tall people- bike super comfortable . warranty least year . thanks schwinn , thanks amazon helping us get back shape time summer	1
this one few led flashligh t-t hings i really like . it gives room-filling light you hold it palm your hand . it dandy thing camping power outages , low power 25% setting longer battery life . it uses 4 aa batteries , but gives almost much light full-size 4-d coleman camping lantern krypton bulb . size surprising small : size regular 2-d flashlight minus head . it also 2 small , but nice features . top small loop handle made wire used hang or attach it things ; if you small fingers , it fit 2 fingers through . it also small feet you slide out greater stability . my only concern battery life : package not list it , but manufacturer website claims 80 hours . i am rather skeptical , so carry spares just case . mine new batteries , so i cannot tell .	1
i've mine three years now it works well . strap review complains necessary : it helps stabilize rack 1 1/4 inch hitch . if i it over , i probably would purchase receiver 2 inch hitch -- they appear more stable bike carriers . but those us 1 1/4 inch receivers , this rack works great . carrier well made keeps bikes away car . strap does't harm car -- my wife would kill me if i damaged her lexus rx300	1
this ball least expensive all my exercise equipment yet i use it more than all others . it very durable alot fun use . foot pump makes it extremely easy air up . i usually add little air every couple weeks . i use exercise chart came ball , but i haven't viewed dvd yet . i highly recommend this kit	1

i one these fans since year 2000 . i found my first one real goods store . used it my truck instead air conditioner my trailer . then i took it haiti used it my jeep . a/c works , but noisy eats lot gasoline . basically i prefer fan rather than chilled air . motor wiring still going strong , very well built . i replace fan blade itself once . replacement blade unit available thru marine supply store . ca-fra-mo means canadienne fractional motors . these units actually built north america . northern north america . canada . they still build things there . i need get i am kalifornya now left my fan jeep hayti . i'll buy it thru amazon all other purchase methods require entering credit card data again	1

this great pair adjustable dumbbells fraction cost . it very simple use takes place 8 sets dumbells very small space . it great trey everything fits besides it just looks cool . dvd workout comes gofit sportblock incredible . it produced mark verstegen who owner athletes performance considered best trainer nation . mark workout very simple takes 20 minutes whole thing but i seen incredible results my arms , stomach , legs , butt . it awesome ! buy it you won't sorry you see incredible results !	1
this great item . it looks awsome , feels awsome . but it not strong all . use this only working your stance , swing , control ... things like . not ... i repeat ... not go around hitting things this . it break faster then you say bull ( you finish this lol ) . i got it mail today end day i taping it up duck tape lol , because i practicing i hit my floor mistake . but anyway , this worth price . i'll buy it again if i money	1
cord-wrapped handle great idea , offering more real sword-like look well firmer grip . my hands tend get sweaty slip around bit long practice , particularly sealed lacquered finish most bokken . this wrap really helps ( though it needed touch glue get it stay place ) . two-piece guard design nice enhancement too . though you really don't need guard all many applications it nice looking appears stronger than original . it still fairly cheap piece wood , compared ironwood version , but this price ( it $9.99 when i bought it ) you really can't go wrong . nice enhancement over basic bokken . recommended	1
i bought this pogo my oldest daughter 5 years ago . it through 5 children , twice yearly block parties , abandoned rain , generally abused . it still great shape right up until last week when my 7yo left it behind my car i ran it over . she now saving her allowance replace it identical pogo stick . it perfect petite children ... only one they've ever tried they actually get bounce . one few toys they've used year after year . update : replacement pogo just came today . although i expecting pink purple , color actually deep red blue . this neutral me we girls either color scheme works . this one looks even sturdier than one i ran over . frame larger diameter , it weighs little more , tip bigger heavier . good thing because i 3 more kids behind older ones who haven't yet sampled joys pogo-sticking	1
i got my daughter this pogo stick christmas she really loves it . it bit stiff first , just like enclosed directions indicated , but once i bounced it up down bit , it loosened up enough her weight it go up down bit . mine red blue - ok boy or girl . she great time learning how use it getting exercise same time .	1

we've debated getting my daughter octotunes because we've played around it stores it seems like fun toy . her father i both some musical background band want her engaged music when she older . we thought fo $5.29 this would bargain since octotunes $25 . when it came i thought it cute but noticed immedietly legs don't honk nicely octopus . not only but one them doesn't honk all unless you really squeeze it . i can't imagine young child able it . shell which supposed like drum makes almost no noise . would nicer if it more hollow . instead it sounds like equivilent banging wall . head- which maraca- barely makes noise . whole toy leaves much desired . although i can't complain price we paid , it nice size toy even though it rather large bulky young baby , i expecting bit more . it colorful cute but that all it .	1

most us who exercise regularly , bowflex sport fine exercise machine . unfortunately though , two hundred ten pounds resistance not enough . 310 lb . upgrade neccessity serious workout . i found upgrading 310 lbs ., i can't bench press whole machine . i would recommend any serious lifter , when you buy bowflex sport immediately upgrade 310 lbs	1
i really like this bike ... it great little starter ' road ' bike . it take some rougher terrain , but i wouldn't take it off roading constantly . i don't think it built tolerate whole lot . after assembling bike we take it our local bike shop spent $10 getting it adjusted just right ... gears weren't shifting right lower 4th 5th . they getting hung up little , but shop fixed right up . seems something bent little . i also brakes adjusted they riding rims wheels they definitely weren't supposed close ! nice bike price though free shipping ! can't beat it	1
we purchased this item 2 months ago our very active 1 year old . we found it nearly impossible keep up her all time , however when we put her pack ' play she would scream . this perfect alternative . we purchase two them ( she needs lot space ) . assembly easy , its easy get out , but she could not pull it apart- gate very secure she loves toys attached back pen . my only complaints this : it still relatively small- i said we purchased two them make large pen- superyard xt comes more panels but i felt edges sharp , there no gate , it hard pull apart . also toys run out battery so fast , there no or off switch them	1

i ridiculously large books half hour walk train station each day . unlike every other backpack i've tried , straps this one yet start ripping or fraying apart bag . only feature i miss buckle connecting two straps across front chest , so they don't pull apart shoulders . however , bag heavy-duty roomy , i'm easily able fit my laptop , con law book ( maybe largest book ever made ) , crim law book ( 2nd largest ever ) , pocket dictionary . overall , if you get good price i paid it , i would recommend it any student or other user ..	1

cathe friedrich my absolute favorite working out . this workout hard -- you feel it right away . it put together very well , you select exercises yourself or just hit ' play ' entire video . her personality great -- she very motivating , without " chatty . " i discovered cathe watching fittv , now own many her dvds . i just purchased this one my problem areas lower body . you need various equipment , though : high step , dumbells , barbell , stretch band , stability ball . since i exercising cathe , i eventually purchased all equipment use them all regularly . i highly recommend this dvd any cathe friedrich items !!!	1
if you seen my other cathe reviews , you'll know i think she fantastic makes you work hard , yet she motivating keeps it interesting . this dvd , you work your trouble spots very hard it tough ( but well worth pushing through ) . results found if you workout often . there wide spectrum exercises here . every possible movement ( like your squats lunges etc ) you feeling it no time . you start standing workout work glutes then classic floor moves like side leg lifts inner thigh work . you fatigue your muscles ( good way ) . following all this , there intense ab work she uses hand weights ankle weights up ante . other thing you should know , there lot equipment needed ( one reason i dropped star rating ) . you need different amounts weights , barbell , stability ball , resistance bands high step platform . personally me , if i need this much equipment , i'd rather go gym . cathe one tough trainer , but she give you results . after doing this workout first time , i didn't think i'd able make it out bed next morning . it good sore , so you know you've worked out well . i really recommend this , but not if you haven't used your glute or ab muscles some time	1
i am very happy my manduka purple lite mat ... i tried out friend original black manduka mat hoping get same quality little less weight carry around travel purple lite mat ... i wasn't dissapointed ! manduka mats so great because their density ... they provide thicker cushioning other ' thick ' mats , but unlike other mats , they also dense enough support wrists , which take alot stress regular yoga practice . i recommend this mat anyone who regularly practicing yoga ... investment worth it	1

i purchased this product local sports show , paid $15 more it than it here . price aside , it decent gun , much better than my first aeg . if you use . 2 gram bbs , it reasonably accurate , even wind . it seems really sturdy , but i'll really find out my first op my friends spring . there problems , though : mag capacity small , especially full auto . i would advise purchasing extra clips , which go 3 10 bucks apiece connected easy reloading . careful when loading : there little switch feed ammo send your just-loaded bbs , all over place . also , scope came mine poor : adjustments light not affect position light . overall great buy those just getting into airsofting . heck , this price , why not buy two go rambo your friends ? :) ps-i'm not really beth ; i'm her 15-year-old son	1

stand assembles around 10-15 minutes , depending if you know which pre-drilled holes use or not . build quality reasonable , but bolts casters don't all fit screw evenly . this doesn't affect functionality , but seems like something shouldn't issue w/ today manufacturing technologies . casters great , allowing some movement bike stand without removing bike . only areas improvement maybe some better design or feature further prevents wheel tipping/leaning either direction . preferably simple machining or stamping solution part regular manufacturing process doesn't increase price would best . compactness good , too . i 6 bikes garage , they all store neatly next each other . value , convenience , size this stand strong points .	1
those who may new suunto , they wris t-t op computers designed manufactured finland use all over world hikers , bikers outdoor enthusiasts all kinds . what makes x-lander stand out first glance , obviously its sheer size . let there no illusions , x-lander mighty big watch . despite its size , it doesn't feel big it looks , though . aluminum case very light quite comfortable , too . next thing you notice would huge amount bells whistles packed into such small device . #1 . accurate altimeter . this invaluable tool avid hiker biker . one thing you must ready remember adjust it daily . find out what altitude set watch before you begin your trip , then end day you need make note where you stopped ( which you internal recording function ) properly adjust it before setting out next day . this not flaw , every single altimeter watch i am aware exactly same . #2 . barometer . i found it correct least 75% time , which more than i say local tv weatherman . this includes thermometer well , which order accurate must removed your wrist least 15 minutes order not get false reading due lingering body heat . #3 . digital compass . this truly one amazing feature , way . once you calibrate it ( which you may need weekly ) you never lost -- especially if you know how use map . #4 . it tells pretty accurate time , too believe it or not . it also comes alarm , countdown stopwatch . suddenly its size now makes sense , huh ? i happen like big watches . i don't exactly know why , but i just . if i any complaint whatsoever , one thing this watch lacking exactly what they included much less expensive vector : tiny little bubble which helps you level out watch compass mode more precise reading . reason why may fact x-lander mineral crystal vector plastic , but either way , it'd nice . i am very impressed just everything associated suunto their fantastic line what they call , wristop computers . if size really matter you , well you may wish go observer or maybe x6hr ( which everything x-lander observer plus it built-in heart-rate-monitor ) both smaller than x-lander , vector , yachtsman many other suunto models yet still offers lot -- but keep mind smaller size comes bigger price . factor all into your purchase plans once again , if all possible , not buy until you chance see some these ( or any ) models person . make huge difference how happy your purchase end up ... good luck !	1
this basketball so cool ! dual action micro pump works . it kind hard pop micro pump out . you push down pump , while you push down pump you unscrew it . it takes long time pump , though . deflate ball , you push down pump . ball doesn't stay inflated long . basketball feels good , it good grip . silver paint fades away quickly . i recomend you buy this !!!!!!!!!	1

overall , this pretty good gun . it shoots fast hard advertised , but its main drawback battery , which take long time install first time . after little practice however , it gets much easier . when i first got my gun tried fire it , there gear churning but no firing . thankfully there " hex " tool fix gears easily . my main disappointment seller this item . i bought gun when it advertised current price , but day after it arrived information it changed new parts included making it now ris version . ( i really wanted flashlight ... ) addition flap gate over hop up system , though not very important , not working because spring attaching it come loose . despite this it most definately best automatic airsoft gun one canbuy under $70 once kinks worked out ( ie . gearbox hop-up adjustment ) i greatly recommend this gun all those budget , or looking just play woods-games their friends	1
i'm pleased quality this lunch box . two separate insulated compartments very nice . salt pepper shakers nifty extra . just make sure keep box right side up or shakers pour out . i haven't owned this product very long , so i can't vouch its durability . it appears very well made quality materials . this box may bit pricier , but quality , extra compartment flatware/shaker pocket worth it . using this daily basis work instead eating out pay its self month or so .	1

this stroller quickly replaced our travel system ( stroller+car seat)for several reasons : 1 . ease navigation swivel front wheel great those times you push one handed 2 . wheels sturdy ( wheels our combo system snapped off ) 3 . it folds same size previous one just same amount storage space . if i one area improvement it would drink cup holders aren't deep enough . when we out jogging roads sometimes little bumpy water bottle bounce out , but you get those drink holder adjusters auto store should solve this problem	1

i enjoyed using this jade mat past 10 months or so . my only real gripe it wore out so quickly . fair , though , it didn't last any longer or shorter than my previous mats . but price , i hoped i could get more than year use out i t.t he mat heavier thicker than most mats . it also , least initially , perhaps little less sticky than some other mats i've used . once while i some trouble slipping mat during my practice , but this due sweat , i doubt any other mat would perform better this respect . money , i would probably go manduka mat . that what i've switched , i no complaints . benefit jade mat , however , it more ecologically friendly since it , i believe , constructed entirely out biodegradable material , which something you can't say most mats , including manduka	1

don't let name fool you . low max anything but low intensity . other reviewers stated , this workout not beginners , it truly advanced exercisers . said , i thoroughly enjoy this dvd it currently workout i most often . i love dvd several " premixes " so you choose just step aerobic segments , just power blasts , or two shortened versions aerobics blasts combined when short time ( or less motivated . ) choreography little tricky , but if you familiar other cathe videos you pick it up pretty quickly . unlike imax 3 , you get chance practice moves bit before you combine everything together- good those days when i'm little less graceful , shall we say . i also love fact cathe finally good lower impact workout doesn't skimp calorie burning . my knees thankful hopeful cathe more dvds this type . definitely crank up ceiling fan towel handy this workout	1

i fair amount looking before i bought this model i am very happy it . i became interested bowflex treadmills after consumer reports rated bowflex 7 series one if its best folding models . shopping amazon , i realized bowflex made 3 folding treadmills -- 3 , 5 , 7 series . online , these look very similar , 5 7 series longer tracks bigger motors . strangely , best source information these not bowflex website itself ( it * no * information 3 , 5 7 series treadmills -- just those crazy tread climbers ) , but rather specs amazon . consumer reports indicated best way buy treadmill actually see how machine felt . i agree . i managed find store 7 series stock . i impressed . 7 series rock stable very nice folding mechanism -- it locks up position drops down slowly when released ( great feature if you worry your kids getting crushed track accidentally ) . unfortunately , i could not find dealer carried 3 series try person , but it seemed like it would optimal very cost effective . i also tried several nordic track treadmills person . these seemed very unappealing walking decks ( sproingy !, bad way ) even high hp power machines , motor seemed power track very unevenly . i decided take chance 3 series would sturdy 7 series i tried --- i am very happy . amazon shipped thing super-saver relatively short period time -- very appealing ! it very straightforward assemble once i got thing place -- parts labeled assembly pictures really self explanatory . it also quiet machine deck * very * sturdy even big guy like me ( 200+ lbs ) . one quibble -- grip heartrate monitor could work better -- sometimes it not give reading after even 10 sec holding . also , aware deck not lock up position unless you reset incline 0 degrees . incline automatically resets 0 every time machine powered . i use machine primarily walking , this application it great , machine handles inclines relatively fast walking speeds no problem . i can't comment how well this machine compares others running fast . jogging it seems just fine . note delivery installation . this thing * very * heavy ( ~ 275 lbs ) . shipping company chosen amazon ( eagle ) great job . i called them prior delivery schedule when they would drop it off -- thats good news . bad news , they would only bring it threshold ( just inside house ) . i asked if they would bring it upstairs extra fee they said --" no way . " three calls moving companies estimate ~ $250-300 move it my entry up flight stairs -- this not two person job -- shipping box enormous ( 80 " 35 " 16 " ) . i solved this problem recruiting my father-in-law ( also big guy ) . we turned box its side , opened it , moved main piece ( track motor together ) itself . make sure not cut restraining strap , this keeps frame track held place making moving * much * easier . even then , main piece weighs 200 lbs serious work getting around corners . very glad point i bought shorter ( 56 " ) track ! overall , great mo-chine -- equal much more expensive models ! glad i managed avoid hernia during installation .	1

this mini stepper similar " impex easy step plus mini-stepper twist board " except electronic counter more basic ( it gives time counter only ) . package arrived pretty bad shape one piece plastic ( where you put your feet ) broken . i didn't want deal replacing it so i use some epoxy it works fine . manual assemble whole thing bad but it pretty easy assemble it . you setup height step very easily . if you want it more compact , you remove twister plate . i like small weights coming it . i recommend it !	1

i've bought three these laptop backpacks this best . well-made , well organized , lots space . seems durable , but haven't used it enough vouch it . protect my laptop physically its padded pouch , but also theft . how ? backpack doesn't yell out " i contain expensive laptop " - it looks like cheapo student bookbag . you can't beat price . highly recommended	1
this chain lock just amazing ! i very impressed how massive this thing . nothing , i mean nothing cutting this thing off . you read details contruction their web site . key lock easy operate , it seem get stuck bit , but intructions say wiggle or jiggle key place . so far , i not any problems . just careful though , because even though it comes protective covering , it may still scratch your bike . not it , you just careful it because its size weight . so far i'm very happy it i got it less $$ than local stores . i'm also very happy i got longer length , 64 " . 44 " one would too short	1

we bought this christmas gift our 2.5 yo daughter , who told santa he get her pink trike . she loved it , pink deemed right one , which good . we loved fact adjustable frame means it should last our ( very tall ) girl ages - she only second setting , despite tall average 4yo . fortunately , we decided assemble trike well advance christmas , screws hold seat place so badly burred they couldn't used . two thumbs up kettler spare parts division , who sent emergency express package replacements so santa could come through day . apart issue , assembly ok but not great , instructions could clearer ( we're both engineers so we're quite familiar tools building things ! )	1

i purchased this after seeing ad golf channel part because i like nick price his endorsement meaningful me . weakest part my game always driving . i'm solid iron player . but , not driving ball well really hurts your score . after little practice swing setter i really felt like i getting club back better position good wrist cock . i am reasonably strong easily make magnets click both settings 5 . when striking actual ball , my driving improved dramatically point where i used use driving iron today where i use driver . difference hitting ball 230 driving iron hitting it 280 driver . my last four rounds since using swing setter over 25% my drives over 300 yards . this makes game substantially eaier me since i now hit driver 8 iron instead driving iron , 5 iron par 4 . result , i am high 70 low 80 , drop off 8-10 strokes . difference going lower mostly short game some poor putting rounds kept me out 70 . but , shooting 70 makes golf fun . there no doubt swing setter helped my game quite bit . i not use short routine they provide , but rather just swing it get feel where my wrist cock should . both settings 5 , my tempo quick , much like nick price . but , swinging fast but smooth key hitting ball squarely far . overall , i am very impressed because i not particularly impressed leadbetter past because he seemed so technical . i just get up hit ball this aid helps just swinging club properly . if you , ball flies pretty well . five stars ! -- john del vecchio , dallas , tx	1
this thing worth twice what you pay it . like other reviewer , i purchased ton books , video , gizmos little improvement my game . i purchase refiner swing trainer it help me some degree but not cure my problems . i very flustrated give up golf when i bought swing setter . now i am getting lot more distance almost no effort great consistancy . i sometimes pull shot now but when i i know why . if you high handicapper you see huge improvement after first training session if you use drills provided swing setter . bottom line . buy swing setter before you waste lot money other training aids	1

material seems durable . 15 pounds ostensibly too light ki training . medicine ball also rather large thus takes away succient pinpointed targeting . good beginners	1
i impressed sturdiness construction this equipment , also variety ways it utilzed during workout . handgrips very comfortable during use . set comes little bag make it extremely portable . only drawback i normally work out friend , kit only includes one set grips/handles , though i believe you order additional set handles without ordering complete set .	1
i bought this system bodylastics let me tell ya .... this kick your buttocks ... ( get them shape ) . even though i gotten out shape over years i thought sure i could jump intermediate work out young lady included dvd disk during circut training part program . wrong answer . i thourghly humiliated myself gasping air , if you don't think some rubber bands ( well surgical tubing steroids ) can't give you work out you would wrong again . if you want get shape cheap you buy this product ... very high quality more than you would ever need . unless your body builder . honest . i owned total gym , i love it but they now cost almost grand or so better models attachments , which cost extra body lastics set same thing you . i really suprised pleased . oh i am now relegated all american cubicle forest work you use device attaches bands door top desk space where back wall your cubicle attaches get quite few specified exercises shown included manual . enjoy !!!	1
i feel this product provides excellent value occasional biker or hiker . while cycling i filled hydration bladder water ice . i also carried 32oz bottle gatorade storage area . there still plenty room snacks , keys , clothes etc . i purchased sony portable cd player/radio . it fits nicely special compartment headphone wires coming out slot top pack . my radio also remote which great when you don't want stop . chest waist straps hold pack comfortably yet snugly your body so it not bouncing around . one negative would report bladder hook . rhis what bladder suspends inside pack . i think it should latch or something hold it more securely . what i found when you take it off , it may slip off then it pinches hose which prevents drinking . i try keep velcro closes part pack close hook . this seems help . overall though i am very pleased my purchase .	1
very comfortable versatile air mattress camping , or water sports . heavy duty construction durable material attached pillow , reasonalble price , make this good bargain	1
i got this frisbee two years ago , i love it . i play pretty seriously 3 times week i really enjoy playing night this frisbee . it 185 grams so it soars pretty well without affected wind . only problem i it after couple years continuous use part holds batteries inside frisbee comes out light turns off when part becomes loose ( which happens alot now ) , but it easily fixable putting duct tape over it before playing . problem duct tape it makes it not aerodynamic it weighs it down , but i am happy i gotten good 2 years use out it . i highly reccomend it people wanting play frisbee night	1
we purchased this kayak few weeks ago enjoyed using it our nearby lake . initial use very easy . we it set up inflated within fifteen minutes , using hand pump inflation . note , kayak not include paddles , so remember purchase them well . kayak comfortably seats two people , room storage front rear kayak . we're using this stow lifejackets our boys . kayak includes two inflatable , removable seats which moved around or removed . we've found they very comfortable actually make rowing maneuvering easier . kayak also easy open close drain letting water out boa t.t he size this kayak makes it so easy using transporting . our 11 year old carry it his own it actually fit inside our van fully inflated . i don't plan taking kayak any rapids , but use local lakes calm rivers , it seems perfect solution	1

basic foam roller .. nothing much say it .. if you think you use it , buy it .	1
i really like heart rate monitor this t3 . heart rate keeps me informed just how hard or easy i am riding my bike . training effect function also very useful feature . t3 little complicated first , but constant use it becomes easier use . i like bike pod also i enter all data off t3 i sit front my computer	1
okay , so i am not airsoft expert can't really go into much detail this gun . first foremost this toy nothing more . it no need go fast or hard but believe its not fun get hit it . compared my ak-47 it shots fast very accurate . i kept short round burst found ' drum ' clip more useful . siliencer , scope , orange tip extention completly useless , don't need them . strap hold really well gun great weight . what i like this gun compared my ak-47 its size adjustability . i barely charged it my friend got some pretty nice welts his back . also i using . 12mm bullets this gun try . 2mm soon . i don't think difference great but adjustable hop makes up it .	1
this gun pretty high rate fire , long you give magazine good shove when you put it , then you won't any bb jam . this gun worth every penny ( but not much more than ) . it great indoor battles or small scale outdoor battles . hop-up very effective gun take any type bb you put there . truly get best effect hop-up , though , you should probably use high-polished . 12 gram bb 	1
product works well my cannondale made nicely . however i wish it real glass . all all good product . thank	1
this second vector i purchased . my first six year old one gotten beat up compass no longer works . watch large dial little bulky , but you get used it . you trade large easy read dial . watch more features than you use large instruction manual go it . it compass , barometer , temperature , altimeter . 6 hour barametric pressure history box nice warn you incoming bad weather . watch nice instrument , but i would warn against abusing it . it shock resistant , not shock proof	1
this may ' outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it big , it ugly , but functions make fattest swiss army knife sit corner sobbing jealousy . overall , i like it but there couple things sound better than they . timepiece : outstanding . it hh : mm :ss dd: mmm , course , year setting avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying modern digital watch . stopwatch lap function ( not i ever use lap function , but i'm sure someone interested ) . countdown timer run up 24 hour countdown ( very easy set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos alarms , this one loudest watch alarms i've heard , i've missed too many watch alarms not appreciate this . altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind neat . over four days , my bedroom went 100m above sea level 25 below sea level ( maps , 40m asl ) . not surprising because it driven barometer , i never recalibrated it , but graphic demonstration importance calibrating it when you want/need it . barometer : yup , it barometer . part i like little display shows rising/falling trend , especially this always active ( even normal ' time ' mode ) . thermometer : take watch off get accurate reading sensor too close wrist . compass : easily best ' special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough orienteering , not surveying ) , easy use . it programmed declination , but knowing me , i'd forget reset it , so i declination hard way . sighting notches small but servicable . spirit level bubble unique among digital watch compasses suunto , greatly enhances accuracy confidence compass . outstanding wrist compass . package : big . really , really big . but controls very easy use seem fairly resistant accidental button pressing ( problem me other watches ) . battery shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but hatch , so you don't need take it jeweller get it replaced without ruining water resistance . display large characters high contrast back ground , display light just right , readible , even , glare free , but not emergency flashlight . personally , i'm going swap resin band velcro strap , but stock strap isn't bad , just not great . overall , not watch office or suit but very good watch , compass barometer , what you could expect thermometer altimeter . well designed , thought-out , manufactured , but really big .	1
excellent product , shipping , service , could not asked more ... thank you so much !	1
cord-wrapped handle great idea , offering more real sword-like look well firmer grip . my hands tend get sweaty slip around bit long practice , particularly sealed lacquered finish most bokken . this wrap really helps ( though it needed touch glue get it stay place ) . two-piece guard design nice enhancement too . though you really don't need guard all many applications it nice looking appears stronger than original . it still fairly cheap piece wood , compared ironwood version , but this price ( it $9.99 when i bought it ) you really can't go wrong . nice enhancement over basic bokken . i , however , prefer natural wood version this one it looks pretty bad once you start using it color scrapes off . nevertheless , if you want inexpensive practice sword this one recommended ...	1
we got four these tables last year our summer party using them regularly . none them arrived damaged all functioned well . we weren't expecting stainless steel sturdiness ( contrary they light easy transport , set-up ) so we not disappointed their " filmsiness " . this year party bigger , so we purchasing four more	1
just received unit . manufacturing quality very good . small , light compact design excellent . installing batteries snap ; unscrew retaining knob twist bottom cover 5 degrees align arrows off it comes . wire carry handle folds down flush lantern body . very slick . unfortunately , brightness leaves lot desired . i looking something i could bring up into our unfinished attic but this unit too dim . reading you lantern right next book even then it not really enough . this makes high/medium/low light feature kind gimmicky . only use medium/low would temporary night light kids room . blinking light feature ok but 2 second interval seems kind long . great lantern very light duty camping use , blackouts or other emergencies	1
my daughter got this one christmas . she wanted this one particular so santa claus brought it her . it lightweight so it very easy her peddle steer . she small side her age ( she 5 weighs 40 lbs ) but she no problem peddling this car ( she even pick it up turn it around ) . we larger one our 10 year old it very heavy ( too heavy pick up turn around ) . our son doesn't ride big one too much so our daughter one move up into when she outgrows little one ! i got it quite bit cheaper through different company	1
this one most wonderful products i purchased . it easy set up it very roomy . i love drink snack holders each kid . only thing it not good shade when sun shining right front . kids need hats or shades . otherwise i love it . i haven't chance use it kids bike , but i know it word great . i plan use it when they outgrow it tote my grocies around	1

this certainly convenient alternative wraps , but neoprene seems break down too quickly . level support protection under speed bag gloves , i think they're great ; but layer under full , 12 oz bag gloves , i prefer wraps -- these make whole show too bulky uncomforatble . recommended good , quick workout , but i think they also run bit small -- i average small hands , mediums too tight me	1

my son really likes it , it good starter bike him road ride , though it bit heavy road bike standards ( again , starter bike pricing key here ) . i wanted him able " try " road biking , it not popular , bikes his size ( 4'10 " or so ) under $500- hard find . i wish tires tiny bit more slick , they're hybrid road tires which means they more grip than road tires but not much mountain bike tires . gears made it look cool him , it got water bottle cage handlebar mounted brakes shifting , which made him feel like he cool bike like my more expensive road bike	1
cd shows how easily sharpen just everything edge . i've just begun my very dull knives found they need bit work medium sharpening stone . i thought getting coarse stone make things go quicker , but after i get them sharp i'm never going let them get this dull again ! moderately dull knife , this simple device make it razor-sharp just little effort . i'm excited get my scissors shape never thought i'd able put new edge my potato peeler	1
spyderco tri-angle sharpener best i've owned . it thoughfully designed , all components storing neatly carrying case . it essentially crock stick sharpener steroids . no clamping blades , no holding blades odd angles . if you hold knife blade vertical you put sharp edge any knife . it also scissors other tools but most people it primarily used knives . although manufacturer recommends using flat side stones , i am always hurry so prefer more agressive cutting edge . there lots cheaper sharpeners , but this quality product built last lifetime . one word advice- when you finished sharpening all kitchen knives , put note counter cautioning your spouse . it might prevent needless nicks or worse .	1

bought two sweetwater filter pumps take 4-day float trip ( one backup ) . i didn't need backup , but filter i use obviously getting close stopped-up end float . i probably could gotten more use it using enclosed brush clean it ; i didn't because float ended before i quite needed . summary : i'd recommend this product . i'd also recommend carrying backup .	1

so i own few cathe workouts she my favorite instructor , her workouts my favorite because they always advanced , i know i always get good workout when i them . this workout so many things i love ! drills ! no dancey moves , very basic step segments , but mostly plyo drills lunges ... high intensity sure -- so sure leave few days this workout . weight segments good , but if you wanting full body weight routine , i suggest jari love . but this good cardio weights mixed ... using ball , my first time , i say it pretty fun ! wall squats pretty challenging me , since i not them before- but i love challenge ! this hard core workout , you pleased ! but if you beginner , i not recommend this workout . this definately advanced	1

my son this trike since last summer . it heavy , study bike he rides every day . we keep it house all winter so he ride around house . it doesn't tip over easily ( but it tip over if my son messing around ) . i put it together myself it pretty easy assemble . i recommend this trike bigger toddlers ( age 2 up ) since it pretty heavy even most compact setting most kids under 2 won't able reach pedals . my son almost 3 still doesn't pedal consistently because weight bike	1

i this month now . goodits nice loud . my ears ring all day if i set it off . also it stand table or you could mount it wall . it very easy arm disarm . i it not go off wrongly once . cheap but works good . badthere no off button unit but might protection . you know so bad guy not turn it off . it turn itself off after few minutes nothing moving . they could put push button code it though protect it . biggest problem it you get up close arm disarm it . however , you plenty time so before alarm goes off . all all good product . main use would protect smaller rooms . you don't want this if you pets or kids walk around all hours night .	1
perfect 1-2 people . excellent build quality . wood handle feels very comfortable . even umbrella this large holds up well windy conditions . 62 " bit deceptive , since it measures circumference . i told gustbuster this standard measurement industry . actual size 51 " across tip ribs , 47 " across fabric ribs	1

tried out set today pool , works well . fins fit good even though i wear size 15 shoe . snug but not painful . snorkel could longer , but works suffieciently ... i've never snorkeled before i think i it down hour ... clear it water you put one hand over end near your mouth while you blow . works well enough you go down , come up , clear water , keep you head down . mask part set needs help , while trying adjust strap , it broke . so i took off plastic adjustment piece fed strap though hole where strap mounted it stays better . i think it works better after i broke it improvised . i think i'll other side too . fogged up bit too , but i bet there secret too ... overall fins a+ not too big , snug fit larger feetsnorkel b- easy use once you get hang itmask c+ strap adjustment lock sucks , better once you break it improvise price/value a- best deal i found lt ;$3	1

before i got cybertool swiss army knife christmas , i already owned two other swiss army pocket knives : one that now sold wenger canyon genuine swiss army knife , other which essentially same , but late ' 80s bsa logo , my early days scout -- both which small simple knives . i've used last knife almost 20 years now , proper care it maintained practically perfect edge smooth opening closure . i love it it reason i still go back swiss army knives : proven quality , i don't any real need try out other brands . i've never one big multi-tool knives however , but i must say i love cybertool . course it all standards , but real attraction addition screwdriver 7 interchangeable bits ( 1 regular , 3 double-sided ) . i lot pc hardware work honestly don't usually need more than one phillips-head screwdriver bits , but rest , even star bits , come handy if you've ever encountered security screws , which seems happen more more frequently . both screwdriver pliers , construction solid alignment perfect . all tools open close solidly , removable items ( tweezers , toothpick , ballpoint pen ) held firmly place . it always size larger multi-tool knives turned me off , but this one just right . big enough house everything i need , but not so large it feels heavy cumbersome my pocket . i gave knife rating " 4 " three simple reasons . first one translucent body . maybe i'm just traditionalist here , but i would preferred choice solid red or bare metal ; i just don't like translucent plastic . but alone wouldn't enough warrant lower rating . bigger issue wire snip pliers ; smart addition knife , but so small it difficult use . leverage there make cut , but depth isn't -- i two cuts , even 18 gauge wire . i only bring this up because there room make it slightly deeper wider . other problem placement hook . instead opening end knife top , it opens bottom hinge middle . placement top knife would allowed it twice long it , while giving greater mobility , hence , functionality . its placement swapped bottle openers i could see myself using it more often . overall , great knife , one i'd not hesitate recommend other hobbyists . while it specifically marketed " cyber " tool , it would also helpful general tool anyone working small parts	1
this great basic no fuss bike . if you read description it say it single speed ! how unfair these ratings , which buyer error , should posted!i'm glad i didn't listen them ! i absolutely love it!it just what i wanted ! good old fashioned bike like one i kid . it shipped fast arrived safely	1
recommended . rubber grip palm fingers helps lot , these gloves don't get ripped shreds few months like some others i've used past . built-in wristwraps great . ( if you don't like wristwraps , there slightly cheaper version without them .	1
these hard find locally me ( denver ) , usually priced higher than here amazon , least five ten bucks . i use xl gloves rather large hands general , so i can't comment other reviewers ' complaints decreased grip problems . i find these help my grip tremendously standard 45lb , 2 " olympic bars just too skinny my hands rip them up considerably . extra padding these gloves allows me entire bar circumference touching only glove material , namely rubber pads . when i wear my xl gloves curl my fingers around bar , leather fingers essentially go all way tip . after using these 4-6weeks ( 3-5sessions per week ) , i put them through wash dry cycle regular clothes , cause they get stinky , kinda like neoprene stinky but bit more sour . they never bleed , always come out perfect , almost like new -- any slack or looseness developed during use comes out they're tight again . i've 7 pairs these now , going back least six years . they last usually year or more hard use . typically stitch line gives out or velcro gives out ( i frequently loosen tighten throughout workout ) , but i've also worn down rubber patches loosened them enough leather surround glove isn't comfortable , although usually still usable . i suppose if i wanted go until they destroyed they'd last two years . far best wrist-wrap heavy lifting glove i've ever used , relative bargain	1
i hily reccomend this anyone who loves starwars . when i hold it its just like real thing it reacts every single time you move it ! it so much fun !!! please get it so you share my joy ! remember , it soooo fun !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =	1

this wonderful product if you cold neck or trouble holding it up . i heat it microwave put it my neck . it little heavy , but it also longer than others i've . price , i think , very reasonable . i love it . klutzy	1
i'm not exactly sure why it bit more expensive but she swears " it so much nicer " than her old one . i'll take her word it . blue very pretty neutral enough she loved color . my only complaint my 3 year old son pulled handle actually broke it . seems like it should bit more sturdy than , since he 3 . anyhow , it great scooter	1
first x6hrm i purchased very flaky , screen blanking out after button pushed . i return it , but found out there recall . new unit functions flawlessly great if you regular workouts you . altimeter , hrm timer saving data you download workout profiles your pc ( average software but functional ) overlay curves check progress during season or year-to-year . only minor complaint unit sucks down batteries . they're easy replace though , so buy few spares	1
assembly quite easy . bike fact " mostly assembled " . frame fits moderate taller riders best . everything quite smooth . front disc brake worth extra few ounces if you heavy needed extra stopping power . most disappointing thing this bike its rather heavy weight 37 pounds . otherwise , it fairly good bike good looks . okay if you paid no more than 150 200 it	1
i've back problems years , due spurs my spine . when i used roman chair years ago , my back always felt great . i love this piece equipment . it comfortable use , it easy assemble , feels stable when i use it , really gives me strength-building workout my back . i haven't tried all adjustments , yet , but i'm sure i'll able vary my workout quite bit them . value , comfort , adjustable , durable , overall great value price . i got ironman 3-station power tower apex/roman hyperextension bench , together price cannot beat .	1
i chose 35 mm version these fenders put my commuter , which i ride 28 mm tires . i looking full coverage fenders keep me my frame getting mucked up riding through rainy seattle winter . support bar attachment points very sturdy fender end , made entirely metal , not plastic , riveted fender . ( some older mt . zefal fenders i before plastic clips broke after few too many bumps fender . ) nyloc nuts secure support bars fender attachment points readjusted you get fenders centered over your tires , but i imagine their built-in locking effect wear off unlikely event you need fuss them more than several times --- nothing some loctite wouldn't fix , though . mudflaps flexible rubber very securely riveted ends fenders . your pant legs folks riding behind you thank you extra coverage . ( i hate catching up rainy day cyclists partial or no fenders . ) i try careful my bike , but fenders get bumped occasionally , these hold up wonderfully abuse , flexing springing back into place . i've put bus bike rack arm over front fender without any problem , though i don't often . fender surface smooth accepts stickers well , case you're into reflective tape or other safety/decorative measures . finally , i really dig planet bike devoting 25% their profits bike advocacy	1
i tried out air pod last weekend my first trip mountain this season . i never heard tech4o before , but they nice site some other really cool watches stuff it . i'm still not sure how it works , but it so cool . air pod tell exact second you leave top kicker measure your airtime until you land . me friend mine little comp see who going bigger off same kicker most air i able get 3.45 seconds . even when we didn't totally stomp landing or washed out little bit , air pod still recorded our air time perfectly . strap lot more comfortable than i thought it would light made it easy check my air even when it started get dark . last couple seasons all i hit rails boxes park , but those got old . getting air pod really makes getting bombing mountain huge airs fun again . i'm defintely gonna keep it my bag rest stuff i always bring mountain	1
i bought this stroller my twin girls , who almost 2 . they out grown their front-back duo glider , so they love side-by-side stroller . it pushes so easy light w/ swivel front wheel option , it perfect going shopping or walking . i like wheel lock event i want use it jogger . only reason i not give it 5 stars because " storage basket " underneath way under seats small . i get my knees reach under there put things get things out diaper bag not fit because there not enough " height " room basket bottom seats . i would also like stroller caddy go across top bar , place w/ cup holder storage keys , phone , etc . i not think you purchase one double stroller . other than , it great stroller good price . i definitely recommend it moms need side-by-side stroller , but need able " cruise " mall or take walks , because it easy handle . it also folds un-folds very easy .	1
i purchased this product after i saw commercial tv . first day i used it , i sore . next day wasn't any better . i've using it three weeks , combined healthy diet , i've lost 7lbs . my clothes fit lot looser . i am not person who sticks diets exercises but this i am able . instructor not annoying all . she moves very quickly through entire exercise , before you know it 20 minutes up . when i first got this , i honestly expected something completely different . when i use it first time , i honestly going send it back because i thought " what real difference little machine make ? " but it makes lot difference . it makes workout little more difficult you don't exercise much you would just regular exercise . i've read some other reviews this product claim bruising occurs , however i've using this product i not any bruises it . if you looking lose weight , gain energy , or just tone up , purchase this product .	1

this good gun overall . solid construction . most i get magazine 38 . it may hold more but given resistance i'm meeting 38 , i don't want force it . loading tube makes it easy reload . velocity significantly slower than advertised . it says 240 fps , but i would estimate it less than half . this my fourth airsoft gun , slowest . although it hop up , even it off pellets still rise considerably . 30 feet , hit waist , aim feet . it good starter gun first aeg , work well close combat . airsoft central provided really fast shipment . amazon estimated delivery date anywhere 31 march 5 april . recieved it 29 march	1
i this raider helmet i'd say same thing last review . i needed helmet went cheap one . it felt like it . if you aren't going use it much , then you probably get away it . but i would go hjc or shoei helmet . i just purchased hjc helmet it feels so much better . you get what you pay	1

just went through one week power outage buffalo here what helped : 1 . crank led flashlights great . i one gander mountain 3 leds you could select either one or three leds light . i also used two lightwave led flashlights , 7 led model 3 led model . both great lasted all week . my favorite freeplay indigo led lamp . worked great i carried it everywhere . candles ok but you can't walk them , they're dangerous , they melt faster than you think . 2 . get led headlamp hands-free , up-close work . i used princeton headlamp but got most use panthervision ballcap 2 leds embedded visor . put it morning it there whenever i needed it . 3 . radios must . freeplay crank radios great must . i also grabbed " safety cross 6 1 " crank radio/flashlight when i went somewhere - i wish it am but it just fm . two other great radios ge superadio , even better , grundig s350 . i like grundig best because you forget leave it run out batteries , great feature . ge superradio sounds much better i used it when i needed break emergency radio listen real music . ge uses 6 batteries grundig uses 5 buy they last forever . 4 . check out " basepump " . it sump pump operates off your house water pressure - no power required . it your primary sump pump or added " power out backup " . what great product . 5 . didn't generator , would nice , not sure i'll get one . if you , read directions know them cold . start generator once every 3 months . electrician rewire your box so you shut your box off power your entire house generator . if you not moving long time consider natural gas backup generator . if you want something cheaper portable everyone raved newer honda generators automatic cut back , low oil shutoff , etc . i think it honda eu3000is ? 6 . we trees down everywhere . i fiskars axe ( lighter head ) fiskars hatchet : both outstanding tools . didn't chain saw but i now , bought smallest sthil model . you really don't need much more than 12-14 " bar . 7 . keep some canned your pantry . fruit cocktail , soup , beans , tough eat them cold but they work	1

hi - i've used lot training devices past . polar hrm several models , garmin x01 gps models , stopwatches , even new nike/ipod combo this one really takes cake me . i scientific background work tech industry , but even though i understand math engineering , it not what i want when i am working out . i want simplicity , reliability features sit there until i ask them . i don't want get degree deviceology make it work each every time i'm out run , hike or bike . sometimes i am training marathon or triathlon - so i'd prefer my unit capable help me reach those goals - but it intuitive stay out way when i just want work ou t.t his model expand gps , or two different bike modules , or foor pod if desired . it also used smartbelt which work t3 during exercise , but belt stores advanced workout metrics so you could geek out pc/coach truly train like pros if you wish . unit well designed , thin , utilitarian yet not overly geeky ( i would take it off black tie event , but that all ) . batteries watch transmitter consumer servicable built training software joy use . yes , there five overall modes watch unit looks good ( so there no tiny text help remind you what buttons which ) - so you need read manual or get help someone else suuntu discussion boards free online . once you master basics how buttons affect software - you feel comfortable focusing your workout not operating device . i am really impressed how well unit works intelligence design went into interface , training software built - well how well display works . built logs also great 15 most recent workout , plus last week , last month last 6 months cumulative data	1
heater element slightly different design traditional heaters like this haven't changed thirty years . it flat lights easier . burner friction fit like all others come loose if you shake unit hard . you must use care handling liquid fuel these things . this heater smaller than big jon-e it would make more sense one these each pocket . one big jon-e inner breast pocket warm your whole body . my tip lighting heater run hot water over base heater preheat volatize fuel . once running these heaters rely heat feedback through case stay lit	1
i've my sollight bottle month now i'm impressed . light bright enough useful cap construction ( panel , battery , switch ) top-notch . here couple my " nits " and/or observations : 1 ] bottle polycarbonate , but not same thickness lexan used more trendy nalgene bottle . sidewalls this plastic flex bit . i haven't run into any durablity issues per se , but i wouldn't toss this bottle around like my narrow-mouth nalgene , either . 2 ] battery cap bulky ( um , it battery !.. ) which take some getting used when drinking this bottle . you really hold cap " flopping " back into your face . 3 ] light output cap isn't bright some other led lights i , but runtime can't beat ( 10+ hours ) . light good lantern task lighting situations such rummaging through bag or reading book . not so great lighting room , although output adequate see what you're doing if power goes out . more positive notes , bottle design super-wide mouth easy ice insertion wash access . also , this thing awsome conversation starter my constant companion booklight , too	1
more functional stylish than any other utensil . serrated edge like mini-knife , handy when you need cut something wild or work	1
ball comes kit seems pretty sturdy ( thick outer shell , should hold up well ) . i ordered 65cm ( because i already good quality 55cm fitball ) , but it seems small me - it isn't any bigger than my fitball honest . i note poster said it took over three days her ball relax enough fill it full size , so maybe problem ( although i got this friday it now sunday ... ) . workout starts alot lunges , which i absolutely detest ( i don't mind squats , but iunges bother my knees , even though i use proper form ) . once you get past lunges , rest workout seems pretty good . music kind bland boring - something livelier would nice .	1
actually quite well rounded good-hard video . it really works all your body parts , including arms , legs , back stomach . people video smile bit too much , but instructor not too peppy , which good	1
my daughter i each using hydracoach 2 weeks . they well-constructed pleasing eye . before i mention few problems i should state they achieved their purpose causing us drink more water so we continue use them . now some problems : when bottle first filled , first few ounces require extra effort sip . measuring device not accurate . bottle 22 ounces but you refill 2 ounces left . we both found drinking those 20 ounces registered 12-16 ounces display . we compensated this reducing our goals , e.g. 100 ounces drinking equals approximately 75 ounces display . i found ounces my display occasionally jump while bottle just sitting . one time it jumped over 500 ounces . two other times it jumped 5-10 ounces . my daughter not experienced these jumps	1

my original goal replacement rearview mirror compass temperature but installation would very complicated involving major disassembly vehicle . this unit performs well , if not better installation breeze ! compass actually reads out degrees appears very sensitive . wireless remote temerature sensor easy install ( many choices location ) works perfectly . new mirror i considering would cost more than twice much this unit . i am very , very pleased	1
just got back our first trip this tent , it performed admirably . set up quick easy , take down . we high winds rain , but tent felt solid not single drop moisture collected or leaked inside . overall , great product price we paid ( bought it sale ) . 5 5 rating indicates tent described performs all functions it claims . very roomy two , lightweight its size ( though it might tad heavy extended backpacking treks - still , light enough hike few miles ) . recommende	1
people who write negative comments this unit surprise me . i've used many ' ab-machines ' none isolate abdominal region good this . my gym one these i used it all time untill someone stole it , so i went ahead forked over 180 bucks it delivered . i mean oprah winfrey gives it her endorsement what more you need	1
i assume extreme underappreciated because i can't find reviews it . i've wanted bowflex decade but too cheap too busy seriously consider buying one . i finally pitched all cheap substitutes got real thing . i chose extreme because it smaller footprint ability all my exercises upright ( lying down bench 5:00 a.m. doesn't much my motivation ) . putting it together tedious instructions bit hard follow because pictures didn't always fit process but basic reading mechanical skills get you through it . training video pretty good , tom purvis knows his stuff . i surprised some exercises included basic program poster not included dvd . lame , but not issue my personal trainer background . what i like most extreme i remove seat several exercises sitting large exercise ball add stabilization challenge my workout . i also found i use extreme like rowing machine when i use exercise ball . it looks like extreme 2 , which set up so you don't ( thus cannot if you want ) change cable settings , probably wouldn't work exercise ball . not sure , but that my guess . long story short : excellent construction design , great if your workout space limited , pretty fast switching exercises , leg attachment worth extra bucks but watch specials because you sometimes get it added free . great overall deal ! downsides : shor t-t erm : tedious assembly , dvd doesn't cover all exercises . long-term : 210 lbs resistance isn't going cut it if you're serious strength trainer which means extra $100 two more 50lb rods .	1
these great use light weight . i use everytime i go camping or hiking	1
i don't own one these , but i use them gym every chance i get . i'm big fan trying new things stay shape , bosu trainer amazing ... balance crucial many different things , bosu great way prep snowboarding season , work surfing technique , simply train your core muscles ways you never knew possible . this should part everyone routine	1
i bought this pack my trek 6000 mountain bike . it just big enough spare tube blackburn airfix inflator/multitool . it small enough fit perfectly under back my saddle without any protrusion small enough not add too much weight . i chose velcro version because they tightened up closer bottom saddle more securely . other version seems hang saddle bounce freely under it . side note , i small aero wedge pack velcro my trek road bike because tube takes much less space . tight fit both carrying what i really need case flat , chain problem or necessary tweak	1
bar worked great held really well first set brackets , but held little too well second set . i can't get bar off anymore !!! telescoping mechanism stopped working . if anyone any suggestions ..	1
i read reviews this bar falling down , even though i weigh 220 lbs , i bought it anyway . long you install brackets , it hold up anyone . main thing i like this bar brackets hold bar any direction pulling . there only two downsides this bar . brackets stick out into doorway good 1 1/2 inches each side . also only one side bar foam grip	1
product very good comparison competitors .. much softer after 10 minutes workout- you forget they your wrists ... only negative point- bit too short around wrist , but i understand- they designed women anyway :	1
my son no problems doing push-ups this bar ... he happy this item	1
despite its awkward size , it comfortable wear what it supposed	1
treadmill high quality runs fine , although it bit loud side when running it . features settings exactly what we looking . however , warned free shipping . amazon contracts local shipping companies deliver product . i thought everything going good when shipping company called me set up delivery window . but , when they arrived , they laughed when i said i cleared way down steps back basement entrance where treadmill would placed . main delivery guy said " man what you trying , break my back ? " he then proceeded tell me delivery " threshold delivery " meant they would carry it threshold front door . he then said if i wanted it brought somewhere else , i needed pay extra make those arrangements ahead time . it got little ugly point told them their delivery slip said nothing which threshold bring it . so i gave them choice bringing it threshold my back door or loading it back up truck . they reluctantly agreed bring it back door . after they left , i realized how heavy this thing really . i estimated over 300 lbs . it took all i could muster get box over sliding door track inside house . even if you broke down box carried pieces one one , treadmill/motor portion device all one piece easily 200 lbs . only other pieces console support arms which weigh very little themselves . i ended up straining my back process bringing it . i am most angry amazon not making it clear delivery only door , not inside . also , amazon not offer any other shipping options time order . i definitely think twice ordering large item amazon again	1
i got 20 these project just hell it i loaded em all up shot through clip each . one so little power i couldn't actually feel impact 2 " away . seemed want shoot 90 degrees where you actually pointing . remaining 18 actually pretty spry . hell this amount shipping i paying buck gun ! buck toy gun removable clip working slide good enough right there , fact they shoot bonus	1

nice item keep your foam roller breaking down or getting flattened	1
easy assemble solidly built - good value money . main complaint i after months operation comfort seat - it bit stiff long sessions . beyond i've noticed central piston gets extremely hot during extended use ( 60 minutes or more ); sometimes this seems cause it slip or lose resistance . my experience this fixed merely letting piston cool checking resistance setting . i've taken using unit half hour increments avoid these issues	1
i purchased this month ago , it great so far ! it came out box mostly assembled , only took 10 minutes finish assembly . it really doesn't come any instructions use , but if you go online look rowing machine instructions , there 4 or 5 sites instructions help . foot pedals take little getting used ; i experimented found best thing wear shoes strap your feet tight-otherwise feet tend slip off pedal . i am trying come up way make back lip pedal higher so my feet won't slide off so easily , but haven't really come up anything yet . it not huge problem , just annoyance . after first or second session using machine , you learn little tricks keep your feet place , they seem make me work harder too since i am gripping more my toes well using my toes feet help my pull myself back start point . this definitely full body workout ; it made more difficult if you prefer shock adjustable ring increase resistance . i feel it most my legs , butt , back stomach , believe it or not . one thing i find you watch your posture this all other rowing machines , or you end up very bad backache end session . money , it good sturdy piece equipment , well worth money	1
i purchased this set goggles because they one best i used . they not leak . this my second set vanquisher goggles i likely purchase additional sets needed . only drawback i see anti-fog coating wears off very quickly . however , i think you find this every set goggles . speedo makes premium products these goggles live up speedo tradition	1
i've using these goggles while now . i've tried several other goggles fit silicone just right , very comfortable . i thought silcone would wear out , but it lasted me many swimming sessions still airtight ( although i adjust straps tigther because silicone straps loosening use ) . vision good but i've better view other goggles . it also fog up slightly extended use . anti-fog drops or spit fix up . i've used them swim lakes ( triathlon ) extended periods no issues . i've also noticed speedo quality all products i've tried ( silicone swim caps , swim jammers ) above par . i guess that why they're industry leaders . it great pair goggles amazon got great price them free shipping boot	1

we 2 inflatable convertible chair/sleeping bags our girls ages 5 7 ( 1 nemo 1 tinkerbell ) . we use them regularly . they light so girls move them around take them friends or relatives houses sleep-overs . nemo bag easy inflate cover removable so you toss it into washing machine . it bit struggle get already inflated bag back into cover once it washed since it takes 5-10 minutes inflate bag we don't deflate it after each use . our girls twin beds so we slide inflated sleeping bag under bed until we need it . this storage spot also helps keep all sorts other toys " hiding " under little girls beds too ! most time they convert bed into chair leave it infated their rooms . our girls love play video games use their chairs all time - it great feature . they carry them down playroom or living room ( if i let them ) . even 5 year old convert it bed into chair 1 minute . we very pleased these inflatable chair beds but reason only 4 out 5 stars first tinkerbell bed bad seam would not inflate . ( nemo tinkerbell basically identical design . ) we returned it without any problems company sent new replacement right away which worked fine . box you receive sleeping bag , inflatable bed , pump 1 time mini repair kit ( vinyl patch glue ) . if you plan buy inflatable sleeping bad , then purchase one like this convertible chair feature . it certainly worth it .	1

i bought eos replace small cateye light i used helmet light until it unexpectedly died me . i commute bike i got over 3,000 miles solid-on or flashing light cateye , but i expected more . eos costs same cateye unit uses same aaa batteries ( i prefer aa runtime , i'll put up weight - this only reason i didn't give eos 5 stars ) . however , eos ' light * bright * - nearly bright my 10-watt halogen main light . runtime quite good - i got over week commuting provided alkaline batteries before switching rechargables . light doesn't seem dimmer rechargables , unlike some other led lights . cateye required some ingenuity mount my helment - eos comes proper helmet mount addition handlebar mount . it clear light originally designed mounted headband , which fine me . battery compartment secured small screw knurled edge grip , seems reasonably waterproof . i've used it light rain no problems i don't expect eventual downpour cause any trouble , either . bottom line - i'd buy it again . this one winner	1

first off , these belts not " melt " fat your waist . if you notice , your " love handles " often times cool touch , which means there limited bloodflow area . belt such this one thing : help stimulate bloodflow area , which increase chances burning fat love handles . they - like everything else - totally useless if you not exercise maintain proper diet . also , loss inches not equal loss fat . measure fat loss area you need caliper , not tape . these belts no means miracle workers , but some benefit those who problems love handles	1

just got minimoto dune buggy kids christmas 2005 . kart very sturdy well made . real heavy duty tires take beating . actual replaceable/adjustable rod ends steering system just like more expensive gas powered karts . initial charge out box took bit longer but i believe it fully charged dead after 6 hours . ride time fully charged battery 45 minutes but considering speed this kart runs ( 18 miles hour ) those 45 minutes blast . very quiet so neighbors wont mind bit hours hours your kids spend buzzing up down your street ! highly recommended !	1
it inflates easy , very stable , reasonable storage space ( front under net behind seat ) . some issues i it hull valves tear easily when cold ( under 40�f ) . i've two places hull tear , two valves . good news super glue works amazingly well repairing both these ( when given enough time cure ) . this kayak given me 20+ good trips since september despite issues , still going strong . if you more money spend , i would get higher quality kayak . but if you're tight budget and/or beginner you can't beat this kayak under $100	1

i am jump rope nut . i knew guy who bad knees lost 75lbs jumping rope every day instead running . it always lingered my mind jumping could best way exercise . it burns more calories per minute than running less- yes less impact far than running . most folks don't realize . after bead rope reading up more , going boxing gyms , i realized speed rope trick . however , i also like gadgets . so , i got tanita digital jump rope . it ingenious- counts calories rotations . but it wasn't fast enough . it sells amazon , i recommend it well . so i got buddy lee professional metal , super fast rope . i love it , but it $40- also amazon . i just got this one- discovery rope love it . it takes little setting up then it fastest rope i . i find it very motivating . you see , addition counting calories , it also countdown timer . you set how long you want jump ( not counting time spent huffing , puffing panting til you become more conditioned ... ) it keep track . it also counts repetitions . it also half price very reasonable tanita model . timer very sensible , because you don't watch clock or even near one course when you're jumping you can't exactly look your watch . i highly recommend this . i've bought 10 them give friends well . only thing i wish they ( although it would add lot price ) pulse function built into handle beep option so you could gauge your intensity without even looking . ( hint : free idea discovery ! )but my heart rate strap watch work ok task . told you i love gadgets	1

i like this gun alot . first when i saw it i thought it wouldn't so powerful , i would just use it secondary weapon . it still my secondary weapon , but i still use it alot , sometimes i put awat my mp5 use instead . it holds dedcent sized clip pistol shoots 200 fps . go 75ft . its like sniping pistol ! only disadvantage when u try take out mag . fire fight it dosn't drop u pull it out , so waste some time fight . i also wouldn't use it my primary weapon because u 2 cock it every time , but if it semi automatic i would defenatly use it . bad thing it sometimes bb jam , then u take gun apart fix it . i think it good secondary weapon , if someone relatively far away ( 25-60ft . ) u snipe them it . it defenatly good buy	1
we bought this bocce set over year ago , we've very happy it . balls full 110mm , size heft cheap sets lack . after year heavy use abuse lots different environments , balls show very little wear . carrying crate well-constructed , seems made last . it little awkward carry any significant distance , though , so you might consider nylon carrying bag if you travel them very much . all all , wise purchase	1

this trike very sturdy - even more so than some other kettrikes our family purchased , which saying something . tough part already assembled you when it arrives ( yippee ! ) but i should say remaining directions kind sketchy . not difficult , but take some time really study pictures ( it german company so there not detailed written english directions ) ..... sometimes they toss part there it not easy see what they just or exactly how they it . anyway , so far it beautiful looks like long-lasting , well-made product . i am very pleased	1

these skewers very cost effective way reduce weight increase security . trading away " quick release " ability you cut weight cam lever . losing little convenience you'll save 50-80 grams only 15 bucks . one most favorable weight/cost purchaces made . you also gain little security . i might dispute ads claim it prevent theft , but i think it help lower your odds trouble . thieves who eye your wheelsets look easier targets than your bike . i always u locked my frame cable locked my wheels frame stationary object i still two fronts one rear stolen before i bought these . year since , i haven't any issues yet .

very high incredibly important monounsaturated fats !, nutshell : super food supplement like brewer yeast - lecithin - wheat germ or cod liver oil over 5 times more monounsaturated fat than polyunsaturated fat ! -- -- over 20 times more monounsaturated fat than saturated fat ! but that not all --- flax seed nutritionally complex food . flax seed contains very high concentration alpha linoleic acid ( ala ) omega-3 essential fatty acid plus fiber , lignan many naturally occurring vitamins minerals . increasingly , recent studies revealed flax seed help reduce serum cholesterol levels , fights cancer controls blood glucose levels . it important buy whole flax seeds then grind them : buying flax seed unground , keeps it fresh , retains all nutrients while shelf . however , it important grind flax coffee grinder before using , otherwise flax seed most likely pass through your digestive system intact , you not received benefits consuming them . it important avoid ground flax , since no matter how wholesome , fresh flax when it ground , it loses its nutrient value , turns rancid very quickly , even when purchased vacuum sealed container . essence , vacuum sealed container only useful if you use all flax soon container opened . course assumes it sealed soon it ground first place . fyi - traditionally , " golden flax " higher oil than ordinary yellow flax which traditionally higher fiber . bottom line : one several brands i consume daily - but i pick golden when i get it ! this " now flax " organic food supplement which enhance human health when used daily , truly excellent value . however , given choice , i would spend extra . 20 cents choose " golden flax " product because golden flax traditionally higher beneficial oils reason consuming flax first place .	1

this may ' outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it big , it ugly , but functions make fattest swiss army knife sit corner sobbing jealousy . overall , i like it but there couple things sound better than they . timepiece : outstanding . it hh : mm :ss dd: mmm , course , year setting avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying modern digital watch . stopwatch lap function ( not i ever use lap function , but i'm sure someone interested ) . countdown timer run up 24 hour countdown ( very easy set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos alarms , this one loudest watch alarms i've heard , i've missed too many watch alarms not appreciate this . altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind neat . over four days , my bedroom went 100m above sea level 25 below sea level ( maps , 40m asl ) . not surprising because it driven barometer , i never recalibrated it , but graphic demonstration importance calibrating it when you want/need it . barometer : yup , it barometer . part i like little display shows rising/falling trend , especially this always active ( even normal ' time ' mode ) . thermometer : take watch off get accurate reading sensor too close wrist . compass : easily best ' special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough orienteering , not surveying ) , easy use . it programmed declination , but knowing me , i'd forget reset it , so i declination hard way . sighting notches small but servicable . spirit level bubble unique among digital watch compasses suunto , greatly enhances accuracy confidence compass . outstanding wrist compass . package : big . really , really big . but controls very easy use seem fairly resistant accidental button pressing ( problem me other watches ) . battery shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but hatch , so you don't need take it jeweller get it replaced without ruining water resistance . display large characters high contrast back ground , display light just right , readible , even , glare free , but not emergency flashlight . personally , i'm going swap resin band velcro strap , but stock strap isn't bad , just not great . overall , not watch office or suit but very good watch , compass barometer , what you could expect thermometer altimeter . well designed , thought-out , manufactured , but really big	1

you always hear reviews say " if i loose this i would buy one . " well , i bought one when model first came out it worked great more than year , then it lost cross country move . after few weeks i realized how much i missing it many every day tasks . i now purchased my second blur . they great knifes . only drawback you cannot sharpen it yourself serrated section , but get you any knife . spring assist functions great without any unintentional openings . safe , fast , useful . highly recommended .	1
perspective , my last pocket knife kershaw sapphire plain blade , so this step off beaten track . handle wide enough comfortable grip but slim enough my pocke t--t he sandpaper-like insets snag my jeans but hopefully won't turn out bad thing . this no means small pocket knife , blade large , but stable , good balance handle . if it wasn't slim it i wouldn't even try carry i t.t he speed safe little bit surprise , i thought it would lot less forceful than it . honest , i wouldn't bring this out public ( sapphire exciting butter knife ) because attention snapping it open likely attract . if anything , that only downside it -- it looks useful it . don't surprised if you get " even legal ? " reaction	1

i tried out air pod last weekend my first trip mountain this season . i never heard tech4o before , but they nice site some other really cool watches stuff it . i'm still not sure how it works , but it so cool . air pod tell exact second you leave top kicker measure your airtime until you land . me friend mine little comp see who going bigger off same kicker most air i able get 3.45 seconds . even when we didn't totally stomp landing or washed out little bit , air pod still recorded our air time perfectly . strap lot more comfortable than i thought it would light made it easy check my air even when it started get dark . last couple seasons all i hit rails boxes park , but those got old . getting air pod really makes getting bombing mountain huge airs fun again . i'm defintely gonna keep it my bag rest stuff i always bring mountain	1

i knew i would like bike , i've using identical one local gym . ordering delivery fast painless . assembly simple . then i disappointed find severe vibration low speed , which i thought might same noted previous reviewer ( flywheel problem ) . bike useable , but clearly not right . i contacted schwinn directly , who helpful , but not seem all knowledgeable bike or its problems . they immediately offered set up tech visit fix it , but called back next day say they no techs this area ( new mexico ) , only solution return it amazon . i said i'd see if i could diagnose problem first , which , not surprisingly , they thought just fine . after removing chain guard , problem obvious . chain so tight i'm surprised it hadn't snapped . poor quality control assembly line . adjustment chain tension flywheel end fairly easy , cured vibration . hopefully there no more problems . conclusions : these great spin bikes , seem well made , but quality control may issue . one two ic elites local gym warped flywheel delivery - manufacturing rather than assembly fault presumably . contrast , ten older schwinns few problems . lack any service availability here makes me wonder how easy it get warranty work if needed . i guess i should ask	1
this one my favorites ... perfect fit , nice details , great cargo water capacity . 100% satisfied highly recomende	1

it appears schwinn read minor problems sited numerous reviews older model 213 , fixed every single one those problems added walk through design . i lot research on-line well going around every large retailer professional dealer nashville , tn . based my research discussions i bought schwinn 231 sight unseen never happier . granted , i've only bike month now but so far this bike compares quite well bikes i tested cost 2-5 times what schwinn 231 costs . it completely stable , virtually silent , more importantly , it very comfortable . i'm really big guy , 6'3 " overweight . this bike fits me my wife . i just started working exercise physiologist who top line expensive gear his club ( cybex , lifecycle , etc ) . schwinn 231 recumbent bike he now recommending his clients in-home use . he even plans add few 231 his exercise floor . if you're looking biggest bang buck recumbent bikes , my research experience so far tells me schwinn 231 doesn't any competition it current price point $550 . ps : cycle sport fitness bike $550 free sh	1

actually you can't judge this flashlite till you get your hands one them , even day light it working , let alone dark , it just lights lights . batteries quite expensive , but quality great . i love i	1
light performs advertised noted earlier reviews . my sample comes month #2 production . early manufacturing issues seem ironed out , because i can't find anything negative this light . it bright low some very expensive 1x123 lights i bought only few years ago . they served me well , but fenix my new edc . when incandescent flashlights first invented i'm sure they very expensive ( adjusted today dollars ) . design manufacturing improvements eventually gave us well-made reliable maglites ( similar other companies ) bought cheap every street corner today . just several years ago well-made high output led flashlight cost over $100 . fenix p1d-ce milestone our path pricey beginning ultimate goal - pocket size light multiple output levels , puts out tons brilliant white light while never needing new bulb , affordable . p1d-ce deserves milestone status because it twice bright costs half much , while still well manufactured , compared lights available right before its release . performance price led lights continue improve ? you bet it . right now , though , p1d-ce benchmark this class lights . buy it if you need $70 spare . buy rechargeable rcr123 setup power it if light see frequent use . if your service needs more occasional then use standard 123 batteries . buy them $1 - $1.50 each bulk web instead $5 each locally	1
you amazed how bright this little flashlight . i own several led flashlights this one beats them all hands down . this beast powered 1 cr123a battery 5 settings . primary , maximum , low , strobe , sos strobe . fenix claims 50,000 hour life cree led . my only gripes flashlight . it rather expensive but worth every penny . holster fairly cheap ( nylon elastic ) . unusual way switch settings . twist bezel turn primary light , twist it off again quickly change next output so . these all very minor no effect my rating . it very top notch flashlight . there rumors loose threads bezel which could cause water leak but mine not this problem . final note . if you purchase this flashlight you should also invest protected rcr123a kit , it'll save you fortune battery cost . also if you plan hook it up your keychain get natural color way scratches won't show up so easily .	1
pocket heater came quickly chelsea watch worked great out package . it made japan quality look it leads me believe it work long time . it gives out enough heat keep my hands warm last full day or half day , depending how much fuel one puts . lights easily stays lit . i love it	1
bought this way exercise through cleveland winters . easy assembly . owned it two weeks . easy work up swea t.t wo negatives : fan louder than i anticipated there no way disengage it necessitating high volume music/tv while rowing . polar heartrate monitor not report accurately when exercising . heart rate ok rest , but movement it jumps all over . overall - well worth $699 - let hope it lasts	1

it so nice find product fits exisiting products . 72qt marine cooler hard find this summer , but amazon it . it replaced old cooler seat our boat perfectly	1
stepper tough use first but that probably because i'm out shape . i've used it several times but not regular basis . only probably i it hard maintain your balance times . otherwise , it great little exercise medium price i like it because it small enough put away anywhere	1
these weights adjusted 1/4 lb increments , they don't scatter little metal granules like bell wrist weights i used use . you might consider wearing thick old sock under them wrist ... [ cut out toe ] prevent chafing ... since terry cloth lining good , but not harder edges	1
i got tired wearing wristwatch , but still need know time , so this good idea . i bought product soon it came out , so i used mine over two years now . i attracted altimeter , but found it wildly unreliable : either or my desk going up down berserkly . my desk altitude 270 meters , but i get readings everywhere 240 meters 350 meters . i wrote company asking it , their reply boiled down : " live it . " also , thermometer usually very slow react big temperature changes . it very good slight variations places like closed room , but if you go indoors outdoors , plan waiting half hour learn outdoor temperature . `current weather ' display always good laugh . overall , i enjoy this , but i hope their next model better . ps : shortly after i wrote this review , clip broke , replaced twenty bucks . may 2006 .	1
works advertised . i've only used them month so far , but they certainly make lifting much more comfortable . i expect them last least year or two ; when they " burn out " , i'll most likely buy pair .	1
my personal opinion these tapes cued extremely fast . i hard time keeping up , even after several attempts . grrr . very frustrating beginner seeking inspiration . very disappointed ! pricey item down tubes .	-1
i using transfirmer series three weeks now say while it potential great product me , i wasted my money . i exercising regularly personal trainers four years excellent fitness , so i am not new rigorous exercise . i thought i could save my money use these dvds home instead . while weight portions videos great , step aerobic portions difficult follow . what would make it easier follow if instructors more repetitions same move rather than constantly adding steps switching back forth moves . there nothing dvds help you slowly clearly learn steps prior beginning work out . also , camera angles not anything help beginner learn moves . they claim steps easy follow , yeah right	1

this recent purchase gift . i mine 2 years almost daily use -- doing maintenance around my ( rural ) property -- yard work equipment usage maintenance . it very reliable under hot , cold wet conditions . i use low beam ( 3 led ) most often . however , it not take long light output 3 led get noticeably weaker using alkaline batteries . high output long range single led seems last longer even when 3 led light diminished . i've switched nimh rechargeables which serves me better since i charge batteries often ( not put up using weaker light output until i close exhausted alkalines ) . maintenance this headlamp , i occasionally wash submerge whole flashlight sink clean straps . ( i wish straps removable so i just put them washer . ) recently , one 3 leds started blink ( like strobe light ) then died . i sent it back princeton tec they sent me new one immediately . i am quite pleased this flashlight .	1

i've strider 3 weeks now am very impressed . assembly not too tough instructions very easy follow . total assembly time ( while watching world cup ) 20 minutes . machine itself sturdy enough considering it folds up . i am 195 lb . 6 ft . guy it works just fine me . it very well designed so there very few moving parts could possibly break . it very quiet display refreshing its simplicity . it tells you time you working out , number strides , your heart rate approximation calories burnt . that it . those who complain it not give intense enough enough workout , you looking wrong machine . this strider not elliptical devise meant triathletes . if you want killer workout , you need $900+ elliptical or join local gym . all i wanted machine i could pull out closet my office , get 30 minute workout before heading home end day . this suits bill just fine	1

we bought this when our daughter 3 months old she still loves it over year later ! she uses it so much we've almost worn it out ! first i thought mechanics kind loud , but i think either goes away little use or we've just gotten used it . now it not noisy all . best feature projector . it not too bright or too busy . all songs soothing , even bird chirping soft . it 3 volume levels , but we've never used loudest one . we replace batteries every few months or so . only thing i wish it remote control turn it afar so she doesn't get up . but other than it perfect . but it got long play it , so usually she asleep time it . we've got ocean aquarium ( older version ) grandma house , it okay but it doesn't projector bubbles really too loud distracting . ** way ** this not $99 ! we bought ours $35 i think . i don't know why amazon listing it so much	1

85 " mat probably best 2 different situations : if you tall like me ( 6'3 " ) you don't mind carrying some hefty extra weight around class , or if you want yoga home ( or wherever ) you don't need ever move this mat . it heavy ( like 10 lbs ) because it so dense - but good thing ! it solid mat sense when you twist your feet your mat doesn't bunch up like thinner mats . it also gives you great padding hard floors . it obscenely long - which gives you room stretch out , also additional advantage giving you some extra space crowded studio - call me selfish but that nice bonus . it very sticky unless you really sweating , but point you would probably towel . i use this carpet hard floors it works great both cases . yes , this mat expensive , but didn't you just spend $100 those shoes little shox back ? you should consider your yoga mat just important - buy yourself best	1

i gave this stroller 4 because there no parent consol . other than it handles very well	1
this stroller great !!! i researched double joggers quite some time not big budget some higher-priced ones , but find this one got great reviews . i just received it mail few days ago let me tell you -- i love go walking now ! i put both my kids it ( ages 2 1/2 years 5 months ) no longer put my 5-month-old snugli carrier . also , it makes walking my dog easier , he just walks right next it . it nice , smooth ride , barely feels like i am pushing any weight . it folds up nicely fits into my suv perfectly ( honda pilot ) . it also little soft console water bottles , keys , etc . canopy nice large covers them sun . my kids really enjoy riding it , it roomy great 5-point harness restraints . only drawback i see angle seats ... i them reclined forward far they go they still angle where my kids seem lounging back . my 5-month old not mind ; however , my toddler gets antsy sometimes wants sit up . most part , though , they content entire ride don't try sit up . this stroller perfect fast-paced walking or strolling around . it probably also good mall or other places , but i know after 45-60 minutes sitting back my toddler reach her limit want get out ! luckily , i different stroller those occasions !!! i highly recommend this stroller -- you don't spend fortune get great stroller	1

this truely amazing piece equipment back body health . i suffered herniated disc while i pregnant , some difficulty " taking it easy " my back post-partum i little children home take care . after spending many hours $ chiropractor , i realized traction very healing process keeping spine alignment disc properly hydrated . everything you read positive healing aspects inversion true . i opportunity use teeter hang ups ankle release while , i must say i am extremely pleased f9000 . although quality both ankle release table rachet system same , f9000 worth extra expense . ankle release harder release because it requires stronger pull handle . plus , you reach all way ankles after good inversion stretch . anyone needing inversion because stress or injury back , i just don't recommend bending ankles . ankle release requires two movements - one hand needed pull ankle handle release , other hand needed lift piece away enough get your feet out . rachet system completely different . rachet system push button releases hold ankles , same hand , you simply move it away you . not only you not bend all way your ankles ( just knees ) , it also simple , easy release . i wondered if i wanted spend extra money rachet system , but now i tried both , i no doubt extra expense more than well worth it	1

this device replicates , less stressful manner my opinion , dumbbell wrist curls wrist extensions . while it may not provide pure strength gains dumbbells , it good way hit same muscles less stressful manner . there occasions over years , after hurting my elbow or wrist whatever reason , dumbbell wrist curls extensions caused pain trying . fact i got this valeo product very reason . i immediately able use it without pain . people tendonitis know what i am talking qhen i say it not take much aggravate it , once it back , it makes lfe miserable . this valeo device you still work your forearms/grip strength , yet so within your game pain-free . i very , very happy this product	1

i bought eos replace small cateye light i used helmet light until it unexpectedly died me . i commute bike i got over 3,000 miles solid-on or flashing light cateye , but i expected more . eos costs same cateye unit uses same aaa batteries ( i prefer aa runtime , i'll put up weight - this only reason i didn't give eos 5 stars ) . however , eos ' light * bright * - nearly bright my 10-watt halogen main light . runtime quite good - i got over week commuting provided alkaline batteries before switching rechargables . light doesn't seem dimmer rechargables , unlike some other led lights . cateye required some ingenuity mount my helment - eos comes proper helmet mount addition handlebar mount . it clear light originally designed mounted headband , which fine me . battery compartment secured small screw knurled edge grip , seems reasonably waterproof . i've used it light rain no problems i don't expect eventual downpour cause any trouble , either . bottom line - i'd buy it again . this one winner	1
just what you need where background noise little more than what you want yell over extended periods time . noisy area , plan able heard well only within couple hundred feet . well worth $40 heard while saving your voice	1
read previous buyers comments . however , i still purchased this my 7 y/o . because said problems , i made sure read instructions prior use . ( yes , i am man so y'all know how hard . ) anyway , most difficult part hit-a- way pole putting it away . after 1-3 minute set up time , my 7 y/o needed 5 swings get hang this product . 30 minutes later he my 16 y/o figured out how they both could use it same time . ( helmets suggested ) 2 hours later i literaly pull my boys away it . two points address previous buyer : 1 ) if you attach ends cable pole correctly , legs not cause any interferance . 2 ) if you not hit ball correctly , it not return , ( unwind ) , properly . i would not call this problem , but training/use issue . my sons quickly learned bad hit/swing very obvious , which lead them practice master proper hitting technique . ( short , ball failing return not caused any part device , but improper hitting technique batter . ) it very well built product it easy set up , take down store . because its construction it heavy product , but wheels aide ease its placement storage . i would recommend this product . heck ! so derek jetter reggie jackson before him . ps ... i set it back up took few swings myself . ok , whole lotta swings , but don't tell boys their mom pull me inside get me stop . remember how kid again , some patience , fun play ball !	1

i recently ordered this watch amazon companion ltt observer wear field . while observer more updated model they both share very similiar features ease operation . my first recommendation you order this amazon.com wary same item offered " market place sellers " . time i initially placed order amazon.com out wait estimated 3 5 weeks . since item also offered seller amazon referral system i placed order wound up wrong watch ; turns out market place seller didn't carry black face model . fortunately amazon got supply shipped my watch within 24 hours .... good service . black face little hard come . now then , watch itself . first all it big ... but very light ; almost light titanium observer i . larger face makes it easier read suunto apparently gone back leather ( waterproof ) band , which i prefer . functionally , watch full blown time keeper ( non gps ) navigation system including stop watch/chronometer functions , accurate altimeter , barometer digital compass . both compass altimeter accurate i've found analog portable units . alarms sufficiently loud ( unlike only chink observer ) my only criticism back light weak compared observer , but fault doesn't draw anything away 5 star rating . add user replaceable battery ( suunto makes kit includes battery , water/dust seal new cap ) , intuitive operating system you ultimate back country time piece . suunto first offer this type time piece , my opinion , still offers best . i've used their diving computers field compasses years am fan company many products . i don't think there clunker catalog	1
i bought this my 20 month old son daycare because his school children take naps sleeping bags ... it little more money than your average small sleeping bag target , but it well worth it ! it so soft , well made , cute pattern , thick ... i highly recommend it ! also , it says only hand wash it let it air dry ... i hate mildewy smells so i just threw it washer then dryer ... it came out perfect ... dried completely ... my son loves it too	1

studying reviews amazon elsewhere , i narrowed my choice this stamina 15-4600a bike or similarly priced lifecycle . i hard time choosing , could gone either way . i also considered recumbent bikes costing far more . i've seen some misleading or exaggerated reviews before , but guess what this bike really good ! you probably considering paying hundreds more , because you skeptical something this cheap could very good . i think 90% people this definitely good enough ! it compact low , which means we comfortable putting it our living room where bigger bike would eyesore way . it also comfortable ( wide seat/good handle grip ) sturdy ( doesn't wobble use ) . there low gap space seat pedals , great mobility impaired people so they don't high step straddle it they would most bikes . however mobility impared people anything pull themselves up this bike since everything low . there nothing obstruct your view , which makes this great place front tv . i think this fantastic buy , i encourage you stop looking just get this one .	1

i recently purchased - returned - bowflex ultimate 2 i wanted convey just how disappointed i whole experience . my equipment arrived january 10th . i opened boxes , i realized not only there no assembly instructions , there weren't any user instructions how modify machine different exercises . i contacted bowflex immediately told mistake made , but i could download assembly instructions website . i also told user manual would sent me . one week later january 17th , i contacted bowflex because i not yet received user guide because during assembly ultimate 2 , i noticed one plastic balls prevents cables coming off cables broken . representative i spoke again pledged send me user manual replacement ball so i could use machine . i asked if they could overnighted because machine unusable me broken ball ( which allowed cable pull through ) without users guide . representative said she would expedite order but she could not overnight it . she told me she could not tell me certain when it would arrive . end day , friday , january 19th , it apparent me items would not arriving before weekend it would more than three weeks day i ordered machine before i would able use it . it very frustrating me bowflex would not overnight these items so i could fix use machine soon possible . these items not arrive until 7 days later , making it full month date my order before equipment would functional . these reasons , i elected return equipment bowflex . i expecting far better customer service something cost over $ 2,000 . making matters far worse cost me return items bowflex . using ups bowflex recommended knowing cost bowflex ship items me $200 , i expected it cost $200 ship items back washington . however , because all returns must go virginia , cost ship items via ups ground original boxes virginia $489 - more than double original amount . i'm assuming two reasons explain cost difference 1 ) bowflex must get some sort discount ups all its shipping traffic 2 ) naturally , it more expensive ship california virginia than it ship washington . regardless reason , my bowflex ownership experience only made worse fact i spend 25% original purchase price ship item back . this whole experience made it very difficult me ever anything good say anyone my experience owning nautilus equipment .	-1

where would roy rogers without trigger ? where would lone ranger without silver ? pecos bill without widowmaker , or doc holliday without big nose kate ? indisputable fact every cowboy needs horse ride . what price gasoline oats these days , it any surprise many us urban cowboys shifted two-wheeled variety equine transportation ? other day -- just whim -- i amazon search see if anything would come up when i entered name style my deeply beloved bicycle , huffy " good vibrations " model cruiser . how exuberantly surprised i find myself staring photograph my lovely , faithful " steed . " it still made . hooray ! " classic " cruisers still i'm still astride mine ( even if " fenders " long gone . ) let me tell you my bike : i bought my huffy " good vibrations " cruiser pep boys downtown santa monica , california circa 1980 . ( it looks identical one pictured here . ) i've probably logged over 144,000 miles mine . i used pedal it every day before work beach bike path exercise just pure joy it . my favorite ride took me underneath santa monica pier , through human carnival venice beach , around boat slips marina del rey , sand through el segundo , manhattan beach , hermosa beach , redondo beach , outskirts torrance , then back again . or put it more succinctly : my favorite ride heaven earth ! note : barest minimum maintenance , i'm still riding " good vibrations . " yeah , uh-huh , that right . 26 years after buying my bike ( approx . same price it offered here ) it i still best friends ; i'm still planting my " cushions " its seat still pedaling canals , horse track , or grocery store , or work . now , how many years you driving your car ? think you'll get 26 years out it ? you get 26 years out your job ? how `bout your marriage ? yeah , what i'm saying " good vibrations " last last ... but i real scare recently : bearings doohickey connects thingamajig gotten wrecked handlebars loose whatchamacallit . ( rode it way over year anyway . ) finally took it bike shop " homeboy " tells me throw my best friend into dumpster . " homeboy " says it can't repaired . according " homeboy " bike basically junk when brand new ; fork could break me any moment put me hospital . well , certain " good vibrations " could never hurt me , i put my buddy bed my truck drove it phoenix , airheadzona santa monica , california one last beach bike path ride . i figured if it broke me way , i'd just leave it beach r.i.p. ( rust pieces ) . well , we made it santa monica pier torrance back , just like good ol ' days ! other riders could hear us comin ' up `em because " good vibrations " loudly going " squeeek - kreeek - rattle - groan ! squeeek - kreeek - rattle - groan ! " other bikers probably thought he crying pain , but i recognized those sounds what they really : singing ! joyful singing ! back home , good friend melanie suggested i take " good vibrations " see nice , old gentleman who owns roadrunner bike center glendale , az . two weeks later only $34.59 lighter , " good vibrations " good new ready hit canals again soon weather cools down ! ( why dirty dog first bike shop ! i think " homeboy " just wanted sell me some newfangled , multi-geared " horse . " ) only one thing concerns me : my bike clearly labeled " huffy - made u.s.a. " but nowhere this product page i see country origin mentioned . " good vibrations " still made here , or they now produced china ? i urge you investigate before buying because " good americans " don't financially support coummunist countries utilize slave labor , threaten their neighbors , imprison religious , force abortions their women . right ? sometimes only poetry express cowboy love his " horse .

i bought this pack substitute bulky roller bags . it works great but if you stuff it maximum you may compress it down bit some overhead racks . separate compartments give you plenty flexibility it accomodate shirt folded received most laundries . padding excellent weight distribution makes it very easy carry . i also use this day pack hiking although it more space than generally needed this . organizer section works well carry cell phone , pda or any other miscellaneous items . construction excellent it versatile enough accomodate wide range uses . great value price charged	1

please please please steer clear this item !!!! listing advertises two 10 lbs weights , however you'll actually receive two 5 lbs . weight sets . these weights actually sand , rather than iron tubes you get most other sets . i received set ruptured leaking sand so i return them . but it best because advertising these misleading anyway . set bulky not particularly comfortable . furthermore , these can't all durable either . finally , these most expensive 10 lbs ankle weights i've seen thus far . you'd better off anything other than these	-1
this machine gives you really nice workout , i like it lot . instructions little lacking don't fooled , there lot assembly involved ( takes 1.5 hrs total unbox assemble ) but tools all included which terrific packaging very thoughtful well . i like everything unit except some connection points where arms attach pedal get clicky loud times ( there no bearings all connect this portion , just metal metal washers which my opinion makes 2nd rate connector type ) heart rate strap works poorly until you work up sweat but after it great job ( i try moisten it first but sweat seems work best ) computer great job tracking results too . $1000 it really nice piece equipment but definitely not health club quality , it home use only	1
all home-based elliptical trainers , this smoothest ' ride ' . it one priciest in-home ellipticals , but definitely worth it . we ordered on-line through amazon -- free shipping no tax . came promptly our door we assembled it fairly easily	1
this dartboard attractive fun addition game room . wooden cabinet very handsome - it nice finish well-constructed - actual dartboard itself seems top quality . my one complaint darts come set , while highly servicable , somwhat clunky flights frequently fall out . however , you could remedy this buying slightly better dart set - old darts used kids or parties . overall , this would serve player medium experience quite well .	1
i've using my harbinger 1260s approximately three weeks . padding 1260s took little getting used . majority my weight training machines rubber padding grips . this makes gripping harbingers little awkward first , but i got used it after couple workouts . only time tell whether these gloves hold up well my old nikes . i used those over three years ( they lost ) lifting weights 3 times week	1
if you into weight training , these great gloves . well padded , washable , flexible , great value price . 3 quarter length fingers provide extra protection while maintaining freedom your fingers	1

i ordered this bike monday , received thursday even though i free shipping !!! today friday , after riding bike , i am very impressed . my boyfriend i put it together last night it took 1 1/2 hours . i bought this bike after reading reviews , yes instructions sucked but we knew going . we use few our own tools make sure we really tightened bolts . like previous reviewer , we also confused first rear front stabilizing bar , parts really should numbered this purpose , illustrations not help much . but once we got past , it pretty much breeze put together . i've ridden it today am very impressed !!! bike so quiet you almost can't hear it , i really can't stress enough how quiet it , someone could sleep 15 feet away you not hear it ! i am 5'6 , lengthening bike out very comfortable me . i love everything this bike , although i agree seat could little more cushioned , but that okay . price bike , i would definitely recommend it !! i doubt you would find better bike under $200 . great quality , it provides good workout	1

got it , love it , loved price . cd best buy , they right . if you don't want drop 2-3 grand top line , drop 800 bucks this enjoy . i've used it nearly year . i've lost 45 pounds , combined sensible diet . i put it tv ; it quiet , functions great . pros : price , features , lightweight , programscons : led lighting , not stable higher priced items ( probably not big deal unless you weigh over 300 pounds ) , heart rate monitor definitely off ( i'd say it 10-20% too low)in my years internet shopping , i rank this buy my top 3 . enjoy	1
very solid construction , feels like something you would find top gym . great variation resistances , i yet manage anything more than half way up scale . built heart rate monitor works great fairly good variety preset programs chose . if you looking robust system you should definitely consider this bike . it pretty heavy so moving it around especially carpet not easy even though there wheels built into one end .	1
i agree most reviews . some stated their box upon delivery bad shape . they must corrected deficiency , mine came pretty good shape . one gentleman indicated hearing loud clacking sound when peddling eventually went away . i too noticed loud clacking sound still awaiting day it goes away . someone stated bike isn't geared people under 5'4 " . i agree shorter people going need some propping . bike sturdy . instructions clear . overall pretty good bike . seat semi-comfortable . i really like computer monitor . it monitors distance , heart rate even programs . i took star off due loud clacking sound i'm hoping eventually go away	1

i like bike lot , but i find it extremely loud not very smooth . best part resistance . i find resistance much more realistic than magnetic or other kinetic resistance methods . you work hard you pedal , just like real bike . only problem i i don't use it enough . seat isn't very comfortable , it not horrible , but it not comfy . noise detractor . my bike seems lot squeeks creaks , but they're generally drowned out noise fan . i probably should checked out one smaller fan , but i researched all this online . i'm 250lbs so i hope it holds together . so far so good , but time tell . it old school workout machine . if you're looking something effective , but not refined , this it	1

bought this knife friend . it small sharp . but mainly bought it looks , very bright colorful . though i think this would ware away pretty fast if put much use .	1
perhaps best most useful pocket knife you	1
this knife wonderful ! i'm one last people get something looks this " girly , " but there something it appealed me . it looks cute innocent , pinkish rainbow sheen ( mine lot more green blue than picture ) , but it wicked sharp . since it spring-assist , it opens lightning quick deployed instantly opening boxes or what-have-you . i like carrying mine pocket clip , but it comes safety lock so you carry it your pocket without fear it accidentally open . very essential times when i'm wearing dress pants can't knife showing . it very small though . it perfect kids or someone like me who very small hands . though i problems opening knife thumb stud . it just small enough my thumb slide intercept edge blade . fortunately , it index-opening one flick my index finger , i open it . i carry larger knives my jeans pockets daily basis , but if you need something discreet stylish , you can't go wrong ken onion rainbow chive . it certainly looks inconspicuous , but it incredibly useful many applications	1
this our handy tool avoid our kids bouncing off walls , instead they bounce count . its sturdy but portable enough move easily around house	1
former 2/75th ranger , i found these radios satisfactory what they . i only use it when i need able speak wife while we're working projects ( no , i don't make her transmit properly over net , but i tie it off her body ... lol ) , but these sx800r radios allow me talk her across city block ( approx 200-300m ) downtown las vegas . means trees , homes , apartments , townhouses shopping center us ... just not loud static/white/pink noise . that downright impressive walkie-talkie " toy " radio . there no battery failures/issues . follow directions don't turn them first 16 hours charging ... problem most , i'd bet . belt clips fine , no breakages there either . there lanyard hole you tie them off , so that non-issue well . if i gripe , it not radio , but need accessory mic earpiece , it pita hold radio up like walkie talkie receive transmit because my hands usually full . personally , i'll fix issue quality throat-mic ( whisper mic hooahs ) acoustic ear tube setup ... or maybe secret service hand-mic setup . i digress , but overall , after reading all reviews prior motorola frs/gmrs online , i'm satisfied sx800r , especially price ... almost free , considering my other options . -rlt	1

this great toy small child . i just got it my highly energetic daughter 3rd birthday , she loves it . it great bonding playtime , too . she always wants me jump her . best all , i'm burning calories while we blast !! i gave it 3 stars educational because it obviously not teaching alphabet or anything , but it teaching balance coordination spatial reasoning . since it less than 2 ft tall , she doesn't get hurt when she falls off it ( she ... several times ) . she just giggles climbs back . i would highly suggest enclosure child who big enough really bounce , but small child , i don't think it requirement . it no more dangerous than falling off couch or something . all all , well worth money !	1

i disagree previous reviewer . if you want truly accurate reading while doing exercise you need model strap . strapless model requires you stop activity read results . reebok silver great value what it supposed . instructions quite clear if you follow them you get accurate reading . i am very satisfied	1
this hitting screen works very well such portable screen , sportsrus price good value . construction high quality . refolding process takes some getting used , but works fine once you've it few times . best part this screen there nothing set up once it opened ! you just pull 2 straps quickly it ready use ! it comes some stakes , but i've never used them . i suppose they might helpful strong winds . case handles work well over shoulder carrying . overall , very good value	1
i started using bodyrev because i wanted stronger , less flabby arms . i able work out my legs abs ok without any sort gadget , but i join gym get arm workout worth anything . i doing 30 pushups 3x week ok but too much strain one dimensional - i wanted something intermediate nothing full or knee pushups gym pullups . ( i am contemplating buying perfect pushup . ) bodyrev delivers , exceeded my expectations . after 2 weeks essentials and/or bootcamp 3x/week , my arms looked noticably better . after 2 months they really , really solid , but trimmer more toned . ( i'm grrl , that good . ) seriously , i weight assisted pullups year gym my arms didn't look this good . bodyrev fits under couch , although it usually it so i rev while watching tv . bootcamp workout good cardio workout targets arms core . production quality little rough sometimes " 2 more " turns " 4 more " but overall workout good one you get pretend you're kicking doors while navy seal alden mills smiles tells you reward yourself more pushups . moves designed use " functional training " so it easy imagine when use muscles worked out would come into play real life , even if you're not boxer or navy seal . i can't yet bootcamp all 3 weights , but i most " essentials " 15 min workouts ( better beginners than bootcamp ) all weights . also , bodyrev customer service excellent . highly recommend bodyrev .	1

i looked into buying gazelle because i heard it little/low impact knees i knee problem limited my excersise routine recently ... when i received my gazelle , it fairly easy put together . it took hour . directions easy follow only extra tool required ( not included ) screwdriver . i anxious try it out . so , i streached out bit got right . since then , i used my gazelle least 5 days/week i enjoy doing it . it good work out i watch tv while doing it . it perfect now summer comming here arizona it hard go outside walk or run heat . i rated this item 4 stars ( instead five ) two reasons . one because your feet actually get sore ( bottoms them bumps non-stick pad)- unless you wear tennis shoes . other reason because it little noisy . other than , i like it alot	1
if you parent can't get gym , i would suggest you get gazelle . i got mine only $25 what bargin . i really love this machine . i usually watch tv or listen music while working out . when i am gazelle time goes sooo fast . before you know it , it time me head work . however , like many reviewers my gazelle make noise ( that why i gave it four stars ) . i brought wd40 squeaking stop . hope this helpful	1
i would say average best . but low cost so what would you expect . worth what i paid	1

i purchased door gym based reviews . it fabulous device works advertised . stable , multiple workout options neutral grip , chin-up pull-up positions , after two weeks use , i see difference feel it . broad reach bar just came , after testing it , i agree it shouldn't used kids , unless they've shown how use it ; broad reach bar could slip off if child , jump up reach it . update : this thing genius . before , i would strain two pull ups . now i 15 . i don't lift weights anymore , i use big flexible bands , door gym pushups . i've never felt stronger .	1

if you own shottie this best mag you buy . it holds 170 rounds compared stock mag which only holds maybe 17 . fits crosman s32p many other shotties . slam !!!!	1
i love these things ! they're very comfortable so much more convenient easier store than mat . best if you practice carpet home . super travel . i wish i'd known these when i started yoga ; i'd gotten them before i got mat . cons - ( 1 ) not great full body floor asanas . ( 2 ) foot " paws " slip little , but i've seen something similar back elastics hold them place , i don't like look them .	1
love knife , it just little too large carry my pocket regular basis . i returned it bought chive .. it perfect	1
maintains decent edge , opening/lock/closing mechanism simple smooth . color intense seen pic , pretty resistant wear . general , happy knife	1
leek wonderful knife , but its sword-like point subject breakage . ( throwing knife into wooden target invariably break tip -- which what happened two my leeks ! ) fortunately , kershaw lives up its lifetime guarantee policy quickly replaced both my broken knives brand-new ones , no questions asked . i just shipped them knife , explaining what happened , week later got back new knife . knife itself opens beautifully , though i've found liner lock sometimes sticks isn't easy depress one hand .	1
when buggie arrived , it didn't work . i call razor customer service dept . their service awful . senior agent very rude . i managed figure out problem my own . electrical unit not connected . once it connected , it worked fine . we two them . kids love them . they lightweight ride well carpet . overall , product good .	1
this purchsed december ' 06 given my boyfriend our 17 month old daughter , he loved it ! he put it his truck right away ! great product	1
great product . amazon packing shipping reeks overkill . box twice long deep enough pack four mats . more economical packaging	1
bike easy assemble . works great , cant beat shipping cost	1
feels extremely fragile rightly so , since it broke first time i test fired it . fortunately , i got it free purchase . i wouldn't recommend this gun even beginners	-1
i this bike over 3 months ride it 5 6 days week 20 25 minutes each day . it great bike ! it easy assemble ( though i my husband doing most it ) takes up very little space . i keep it close tv so i ride it while watching my favorite shows . it very quiet . it more features than what i use - i just want know how long i'm riding , how fast , how far . but i'm sure extra features may appeal others . i highly recommend this bike . it very reasonably priced well worth money .	1
i received this bike birthday gift am please overall it . one irritant i found some hardware already installed bike , so i spent 10 minutes looking screws , nuts , washers already bike . just aware when you purchase this , even though there separate package hardware comes bike , majority hardware already installed so don't assume you got shorted some pieces . tension little difficult set up i plan looking more into it . i what instructions told me , however there doesn't seem " easy " setting so far this bike . tension setting range 1 - 8 , 1 easiest , but i don't notice any differences ranges . i know other person reviewed this bike didn't like it cycled through information while riding , but i actually prefer it . i found it nice able just look screen know how many miles i ridden , what my speed , etc .. without interrupt my workout push any buttons .	1
i installed v2000 only compass , my vehicle already equipped temperature sensor . i appreciate easy-to-read dual display compass rose degrees . v2000 seems very accurate it displayed same degrees my army-issue lensatic compass . it easily installed aligned very helpful night overcast sky , when no stars visible . i would definitely recommend this product	1

i really like this storage rack . cost versus function quite high . it now provides place our 4 bicycles plus associated gear ... no more scrambling around locating all necessary equipment ride either trail or road ! it doesn't room every piece sports gear we own , course , but seasonal adjustments puts everything we need within reach	1
i used my mc-2g year am very impressed , i not think any improvements i would make . adjust magnetic declination , compass flipped upside down access adjustment screw direct reading declination scale . fine green index line little difficult see until i started adjustment line moved away red declination marks . now i know what it looks like - it easy spot . two scales read directly miles , one scale maps using 1:24000 ( 1 inch = 24000 map inches ) one scale maps using 1:62500 ( 1 inch = 62500 map inches ) . i believe scales not go corners compass because corners rounded , plus three scales would then overlap . this my favorite compass	1
compass handles very nicely . housing more comfortable turn than silva ranger cl . this started become significant after few minutes handling . suunto used one hand whereas it difficult me operate silva due small knurls housing . bottom part mirror half-moon hole it allowing midpoint view your map . very nice . global gimbal system needle pretty handy you don't hold compass totally flat it operate correctly . or i could learn hold base level , too . presumably southern hemisphere magnetic field causes compass needle roll bi t.t he one very strange thing this model declination markers inside housing printed upside down . it appears suunto went declination readable opposing side while making declination adjustment since compass must turned upside down this . it interesting way differentiate . inclinometer probably pretty handy snow travel among other things . base little wide my hand , silva . mirror appears replaceable . good thing since it glass . map markings don't start edge compass . i prefer this since i never feel comfortable , but it personal preference . it 1:24000 1:62500 (?) scale map measurements . sighting notch seems work well . lid snaps base tightly due thickness lid , you can't quite twist your thumb pop it . it practice problem , i'm guessing . key lanyard adjusting declination , though i don't think i'd it because i'd forget realign i t.t he compass very heavy compared baseplate design but that due lid . it consideration if you're ultralighter . those ounces really add up . there lighter mirror compasses available . base not centimeter scale whereas silva	1

pennants great memento winning season my favorite baseball team . they great condition displayed years come . awesome product great price	1
i picked up 1 these well 3 single gun versions when they $24 each , just before xmas 2005 . they built nicely metal hinges latches . description says aluminum but sides seem sturdy silver plastic , not painted platic thankfully . frame aluminum though . well worth what i paid . i wish i bought range case before price went up . it $42 before . only problem smaller guns , padding doesn't hold psitol tight enough so it moves during transport . nothing thin layer extra padding or magazine added under thicker padding won't fix . locks nice extra but won't hold back older child or adult determined get pistol .	1
we purchased this swim belt after introduced it during our four year olds swim lessens . not only it great aid then but even more so when using it our own . we would highly recomend this anyone whos child difficulty staying afloat when vertical , but wants there own when swimming .	1
i love my watch . function count calories burned during your workout very helpful . i take lot classes like step turbo kickbox so its great able idea what i'm actually burning . it easy take your heart rate if it doesn't take first time , you just lick your fingers then it reads fine . i haven't problem taking my heart rate while cycling or jumping around . watch little bulky so i'm glad i got petite . it definitely sporty so i wouldn't wear it dinner or anything , but it looks fine gym ! i'm really glad i got it so i track my calories burned better	1
i enjoyed using heart rate monitor , but sometimes difficult time getting it reset . probably just because when i am my excercise , i am warm tired . sometimes it take me several minutes get it cleared . but it serves it purpose heart rate monitor i bought it , so i like way . band not most comfortable , but assume just part necessary design .	1
great buy , my three son who this his 7yr old brother five ans 20 month old sisters love it . it use well ans shows no signs distress . easy put together . here time christmas . looking " lighting mcqueen " one now purchase [ ...	1
i moments away purchasing this but decided call local knife ship any details found out clock wasnt waterproof . so seeing i am my school cadets experiencing rain , lake mud i really needed sturdy tool i wouldnt afraid get wet . but thorough research this probably best tool your average user who doesnt want classic red handles . so good size , colour , design , tools but not waterproof .	1
one best tihings i've ever purchased ! i love top ability keep track miles i run calories i burn . because i always suspected stats treadmill off . just wish it came more colors . i'm not really girlie girl so wearing pink watch everyday would bit much	1
i recently bought several blow-up plastic snow sleds try . this one favorite whole family . while all other sleds go wherever they want , this sled steering wheel indeed goes wherever you want . it also seems very durble - i am 180 lbs rode it together my 7 year old daughter , even jumping over snow bumps	1
i got this mail yesterday . it arrived long box filled packing peanuts . after digging around foam clumps i retrieved black white spoted box which held this sword . after examining it i found out few things . i got blade worth cost paid it . detail dragon carving sheath nice . i see some glue around top pommel where blade connects grip . however it not distracting or noticable unless you look closely . its balance okay , but it no toy it edge . enough force you injure someone , especially if you stab them . this something used practicing swings well just admiring . blade covered oil when delevered . you wipe it off , or leave it if you not intend use it . oil preserve condition blade which plus when it not used . overall this great purchase . however i not think this sword could survive combat without chipped . not sure quality steel used creating it . so its great blade admire own if you no intentions practicing actual swordplay it	1
wayfinder very nicely packaged built , rugged accurate compass . it provides 5 degree sensitivity numeric display , versus typical 45 degree compass points most automotive application units . result , some environments , e.g. areas lots metal surroundings , you may notice numeric readout change back or forth you would not see typical 45 degree type compass . it should noted interference environments affect all compasses , but when this one significantly affected , it tell you displaying distortion , so you know currently displayed accuracy suspect . areas i tried it , wayfinder accurate my lensmatic engineering compass , but lot easier use . it comes equipped dual suction cup mount which stays put my motorcycle windshield while driving down washboard dirt roads high speed . post this topic indicated compass would not stay put . chalk up operator ignorance . suction cups must wet stick glass , but manual not mention this , likely assuming people common sense , when obviously they don't . all suction cups require moisture cups stick glass . only bad thing this unit it discontinued , replaced unit more features lot more expense . bottom line , if you need high quality , off-road tough , accurate compass , find wayfinder before they all gone !	1
i bought this myself play ( i'm 35 ) after all presents opened toys , video games , everything forgotten ( 4 hours after christmas ) , this ongoing favorite season . everybody , younger ( down 8 ) older ( 45 ) blast this thing after couple minutes coaching . it already everybodys wish lists upcoming birthdays such . this great present 11-18 boy . fair warning though , there some good spills fairly short , steep learning curve - helmets , knee pads , blah , blah , must ( video camera !	1
i don't know what other people talking , but this gun spring gun not shoot automatic . also , there no batteries come it , except laser batteries even if they don't work , it not end world . gun shoots suggested speed . 12 grams but i would recommend using . 2 grams . this gun so accurate . 2 grams shoot nearly same distance . people who said this gun piece crap easily broken retarded . it made plastic break if you treat it like metal gun . i hade mine several months it works like charm	1

this nice piece equipment price . i looking under $300 collapsable workout center . exactly what i got . it works what i wanted it allows me great workout . only con i see bands don't give enough resistance . starter gym it great , but if someone moving gym home workout it might not enough resistance . purchase replacement bands you go through stamina , but each band around $10 or less so isn't too bad . i also modify some workouts described book make them more efficient	1
product works advertised . used it snorkeling maui water temps around 70-75 degrees no fogging up . only drawback applying small amount since it gel form ... trick squeeze out bit your finger then rub inside mask . not take much	1

if you like me , found taste consistency products like gu clif shots pretty nasty , you'll very happy switch these shot bloks , which remind me eating gummy bears . you get energy boost electrolytes you need while participating strenuous sports such climbing , running , biking , etc . without mess inconvenience those gooey energy products . i've tried most flavors , found all ones i tried tasty enjoyable eat . i like able eat just few bloks time package , contrast needing consume entire package gu or clif shots once ( or suffer sticky consequences ) . shot bloks seem give me same kick-start those older products , i actually like eating them . give them try -- i think you'll pleased them	1
received this item yesterday mail . delivery quick considering i used free shipping option ( week half get ) . piece cake assemble , instructions clear easy follow bolts nuts packaged into 8 or so little baggies one each step instruction set ( this way you don't really figure out which bolt they referring ) . i assembled it myself , didn't need more then one person which nice . hardest part assembling it myself first step , which attach front stabilizer bar wheels it . this requires you lift front end slightly keep it elevated while you screw this piece . once you it though it easy move point because wheels . gave it try it runs smooth quiet me even high resistance i still watch tv without turning volume crazy amount . so far overall i've found it great use even though i've only using it day ;) only problem i back right stabilizer bar got dinged because plastic cap end cracked . it decorative thing but my only problem . i watched them unload carry it into my apartment ( eagle freight ) they not gentle all so only thing broken makes me happy .	1

i find this unit excellent choice money . it adjustable speed 1.0 mph 10 mph . 1 increments . belt ample width long enough longer strides . display easy read controls well marked . it readouts speed , fat burned , calories burned , speed belt distance travelled time session . also there pulse monitor . it safety key necessary operate unit which clips you emergency shut-off . if you want pause session you push stop button all read-outs frozen . if you pull safety key unit stops readout goes blank . belt platform folds up fo storage case it necessary . my only complaint i wish pulse monitor operated little faster . assembly instructions could use improvement description screws could better . although instructions recomend helper some steps i able assemble it alone . it appears solid unit i expect get much use out it	1

you need two allen ( hexagonal head ) wrenches install this kickstand . what i don't like : there no instructions included . even greenfield industries website no instructions . while i suppose there only one way it all fit together , few diagrams would nice . also it would helped know attachment point should moved far rear possible . until i this , my heel struck stand when pedaling . i presume this function both my shoe size ( size 11 , male ) length position horizontal frame member which stand attaches . my bike , i think rider size 13 or larger show might well problem . again , greenfield industries website should provide this information , but this writing it not . inner mounting bracket mysterious hole top , there no matching hole outer bracket . there no lockwashers provided , though perhaps they unnecessary . what i like : it light , strong , reasonably priced , easy install , appears well made . rear mounting avoids conflicts pedals crank arms . it looks great , though it makes bike look rather like police bike -- perhaps not bad thing if one worried theft .	1

cute boy bike --- we pleased style , color , fit .... however , columbia only provided general manual safety , fit , technical information adult bikes they sell . nothing specific how put this bike together . most it assembled when it arrived --- hardware allotted holes , we assemble handle bars , training wheels , etc . now we just fine tuning tightening handle bars special hex tools , tweaking breaks , adjusting fenders so they centered ... if we instruction manual specific bike , we would able make sure everything assembled correctly . when i contacted columbia customer service , only thing they recommended we take bike bike store professional assemble . i asked if they authorized dealer my area they recommend ( especially if something fail under warranty down road ... ) cs rep. said " no , any bike shop could it . " i asked if they send out manuals dealers , if so , maybe i receive copy . response " dealers put together bikes all time any them should able it " . if i bought $500 mountain bike , yes i would probably want dealer assemble . however , my opinion 12 inch children bike should able assembled competent parents who good set instructions . if it recommended professional dealer put it together , it should noted description bold letters so i know what expect before i buy .	1
i am really happy it price . it bit tricky get adjusted , but not hard figure out they say . long you know those two straps bottom belt . it seems well built , although i havnt chance test it out extreme conditions yet . one thing keep mind it might not best smaller body types . i am quite thin it took quite bit get it fit me . i still dont think it fits way it should but least its comfortable . ill probably end up modding it get it fit better . smaller people might better off thigh holster	1
i admit , it little tricky figure out first , but if my 55 year old mother figure it out , then i'm sure someone who police force 30 years should able , also . anyone thinking buying this , long velcro straps hanging down your belt . after you figure out , you should no problems . i wish it would fit little more snug , but maybe i some more adjusting . over all , it comes real handy	1
i bought this rower 6 months ago after comparing different ones . decided splurge this i thought it would give realistic feeling durable . overall , i like rower - it built solid smooth operation . it takes 1-2 hours put together . unfortunately , we missing small , but important part - call customer service - called friday got part monday . meantime , i so impatient i went lowes found part would work so i could start using it immediately . only cons it straps feet - they tend come loose after little while - could probably easily fixed something else . only other con placement feet . i wish i could adjust them little bit terms position . otherwise , i've enjoyed rower think it last many years	1
kettler kedett rowing machine amazing piece equipment . i unpacked mine last night despite missing washer wade through 90 minutes assembly instructions , i impressed very start . solidity perfect fit parts , it clear this machine product german engineering . i haven't seen anything so well designed years . each part fits well , tightens nicely still rotates or slides ease . machine sturdy , sits well carpet or hard flooring easily folds into compact shape when not use . workout kadett better than any workout i've ever experienced , aside rowing or kayaking . motion very realistic , nothing distract one beyond small chirping pistons occasional knock seat against front rail . it easy close my eyes imagine myself rowing down quiet river . entire experience more like meditation than exercise -- perfect way start , or end , busy day . after 45 minute workout , i wasn't sure i really gotten particularly strenuous workout . then i stepped off machine realized my legs like rubber . it subtle . i highly recommend this machine anyone looking alternative ordinary . full-body workout provided rowing beautiful thing . price less than most elliptical trainers , unit weighs only 66lbs , it gives your arms workout too ! i can't say enough good things this machine . happy rowing	1
i bought this keep my bike(s ) my possession when going mall , bars , stores , etc . there isn't much say other then u lock very hardy heavy cable good thickness well . it also nice u lock comes multiple keys , cable comes velcro strap help manage it when riding . visible combination u lock cable alone probably best deterrent , although if put test it looks like they would hold up well . almost all surfaces both parts rubberized so they'll resist scratching your bike paint . clasp hang u lock seems somewhat iffy , but i haven't problems yet . overall if you want strong u lock cable keep your front wheel or seat , this great combo pretty fair ( comparatively ) price	1

simple , yet very effective heart rate monitor ! i got it over month replacing dbase hr monitor gym . i ride bike quite bit so i got polar s720 initially . i thought it way too much simple hr monitoring . if it wasn't relatively high price ( got my $69 , when other brands offer $40 or less ) , s120 would get my five-star .	1
after trying many heart rate monitors , i decided s120 provided best array features my needs . i also considered strongly s150 , however , i don't much information available instantly ( speed , distance , time , heart rate , etc . ) i s120 my cateye cyclocomputer . s120 lets me target my heart zone helps keep it within my training range day . also , when i am my exercise set , i get report date , length exercise , average heart rate maximum heart rate . unfortunately , s120 discontinued . i haven't found any current lineup come close providing features i find most useful . one warning i'd like share when batteries need replacement , send them factory service center , i think there three us . i bought one ebay used after swim , i noticed crystal fogged up . i sent unit polar service pc board unit destroyed because battery replaced incorrectly . yes , polar battery replacement pricey , but it certainly less expensive than replacing whole unit , i now . yes , i am going buy s120 , my third one all .	1
super easy set up take down . compact appears durable . good cloth " pillowtop " which like thin mattress pad . i would recommend this product	1
although i am overall satisfied knife , appearance somewhat disproportionate feeling . what i mean first glance , main locking blade seems little dainty , slim , frail ; but upon further inspection you see blade plentiful thick metal " feels " strong hardened well . i attribute this simple design oversight pairs new curvy body old straight blade design . some curve design main blade , which new one-handed opening eyelet designed knives victorinox implement , would make overall feel more satisfying eye . overall construction well designed feel expected victorinox but i am not sure locking bottle opener totally necessary , even if large flat screwdriver head tool . blade razor sharp right out box feels good hold your hand . sheath would nice addition , even if it meant add couple bucks price , but might just aftermarket purchase those requiring one . price , this knife great buy !	1
i only one issue trainer , my tire slips/spins faster than trainer times i increase my pedaling effort . i need make few more attempts adjusting pressure this might my fault . otherwise it great . came assembled , very easy setup adjust . adjustable resistance great . combined 14 speed you get huge range resistance very easy quite difficult . this my first trainer so i don't any baseline compare it , but i would recomend this anyone , especially novice/intermediate bikers who long , snowy winters deal like we here michigan . great product	1
if you find yourself use your kubotan , chances , it critical situation . traditionally , kubotans made out durable hardwood . however , i chose get one made out hardened aluminum added reliability . hardened aluminum not break event you use it put pressure someone wrist . i think it safe say person wrist bones would break before this little metal rod . friend mine , who studied martial arts , used carry wooden baton like this one . if he still carried them today , i am convinced he would choose aluminum one though . my friend tip : here tip old friend mine . keys themselves part weapon . you make them more effective , which increase damage baton . take some keys you no longer use . any metal key would , but try find different sizes . four them would . take keys grinder sharpen teeth each key . now , put four keys keyring your regular keys . face sharp keys opposite directions . meaning two should face one way , but other two should face opposite direction . idea when you swing baton like flail , sharpened keys would cut into attacker flesh . keys faced opposite directions so you major damage regardless which direction you swinging . citan experiment : please keep mind you also cut your hand . i tried this technique . i wore pair leather work gloves swung against wooden post . sharpened keys bounced back hit back my hand . without gloves , my hand would gotten badly cut . what it worth , i swung against large watermelon keys didn't bounce back though . i don't anything else add here , except maybe it might good swing against attacker fleshy parts prevent keys rebounding . i'm not expert though . but it fun trying it watermelon .	1
product great . small , bright , easy hold , tad heavy but not enough issue . i recommend it . good " defensive " product also	1

i got this ball because i want lose weight get better shape . i also think it fun bounce ! this bell body ball comes foot pump video led mindy mylrea . i like video lot using it body ball regularly , but pump needs work . ours broke before we finished pumping up ball , so we hard time getting it completely inflated -- i think one valves came loose . other than , though , i've really enjoyed using this product . bouncing ball makes me feel like kid again when i work out seriously ball , i definitely feel progress . this cost effective way get back shape .	1

i've used jansport bags since elementary school continue use them this day . i ended up using this particular bag not books but rather alternative traditional carry-on piece luggage . its also comes handy occasional overnight stay hotel where normal piece luggage wouldn't practical . my only compplaint amazon method ordering not very user friendly when it came picking color . i selected black w/ balck suede but eneded up recieving color i not choose ( black w/ brown suede ) . it still looked fine i kept it rather than go through hassle returning it correct color	1
i bought similar backback almost 3 years ago . ( jansport leather bottom ... it only one backpocket though)it lasted me up until last month ... back pocket started tear near zipper point . i wanted replace it " normal " jansport backpack ( without leather bottom ) but when i went retail stores check them out , they didn't feel like quality one i before . i'm so glad i bought this one replace my backpack . it such sturdy backpack . it even better than my previous backpack because it extra pocket back pockets larger . texture backpack also feels stronger . price amazon also very good ( i saved great amount over buying mall ) . perfect college student ... even full load books	1
i'm up down this thing , but it still best one out there . it charges via docking station plugs into outlet . that 90-minute charge one hour viewing . mini docking station also battery-fed connected watch make much longer viewing experience . it fits just like normal watch takes up just much space . headphones double uhf/vhf antennae , so if you hate those two little buttons keep falling out your ears much i , you're kind out luck trying use your ultra-cool stereo headsets . until i figure out what next , i just fit buttons inside headset cups it works fine . reception headpieces keep elusive fifth star making it appearance here . if you think you're going watch your favorite shows basement or train , forget it . otherwise all local channels show up sweetly crisply only most minor intermittent fluctuations	1

i found this good table my personal needs fabulous price . i shopped all over web this definitely best deal . it lightweight because it little short skinny . i prefer it short skinny so i store it easily small room . check measurements make sure it long enough what you want . i like extra-extra smooshy padding , so i added cheap foam pad walmart over table put twin size sheet over , but you wouldn't if you like regular massage table feel . i don't use it portable table , so i'm not sure how convenient it would take down up . it probably better personal massage table , not " professional " table . i larger table my office where i work . hope this helps	1
i've this stroller couple weeks , so far i'm pleased it . my older kid 3 younger one 3 months . both seem like it . i've single-seat bob " sport utility " stroller two years , here some comparisons might useful : instep much cheaper ( i got it $80 ; paid ~ $200 single bob ) . i think it better value money , though bob clearly better built probably more durable ( more below ) . instep much heavier , even taking into account single-vs-double frame . bob aluminum frame while instep uses steel . i'll need careful not leave it out rain , i bob . instep inferior construction bob : - fabric thinner , appears less durable- quick-release front wheel lower quality ; consequently , it takes more work adjust wheel keep stroller going straight ; bob more like what you'd find quality bicycle , fewer centering issues . other hand , i prefer instep quick-release mechanisms rear wheels bob . - handbrake doesn't work well bob ; perhaps due instep greater weight , perhaps not . handle plastic , though quite solid . it easy use either hand , though it oriented left one . - canopy doesn't curve downward it bob . result , kids tend get some afternoon sun their eyes even canopy place . i've " fixed " this safety-pinning some fabric down edge canopy . instep parking brakes separate hand-brake engage using cogs attached rear wheels , whereas bob parking brake just locks handbrake . this advantage 1 ) more secure 2 ) not loosening handbrake cable over time . disadvantage it takes slightly more effort engage than bob handbrake lock . noted other reviews , instep seats very reclined , even their steepest settings ; however , my kids don't seem mind this all . fact , sleeping , instep may more comfortable . seats themselves smaller than bob , but that expected duallie this size . speaking size , instep obviously much wider than single-seat bob . it won't fit through narrow ( 30 '' ) doorways , but that exactly what i expected based published dimensions , which similar other dual strollers ' . it fits just fine trunk my car ( vw golf ) when i remove wheels . one advantage increased width more stable stance sloped terrain . some steeper driveway aprons , i find narrower bob near its tipping point ; not so instep . ground clearance instep much lower than bob . when i descend tall curbs , bottom often scrapes bit . but since bottom free lift up ( unless you're habit carrying heavy stuff underneath ) , there no real damage . instep shock absorbers ( nice ! ) , but they're much stiffer than bob . perhaps they'd perfect two heavier kids , but my kids ( combined weight = 40 lb ) , it seems tad too stiff . little pouch attached handlebar nice addition instep , missing bob . noted other reviewers , straps instep take more work secure remove . bob clearly superior this regard , though i don't see it huge factor given i strap kids , run hour , then unstrap them . bob three 16 '' wheels , whereas instep smaller front wheel . i bit concerned this when i bought it , but after going running it several times ( pavement ) , i see no problems smaller front wheel . if anything , it makes stroller slightly easier pack into my trunk . off-roading , smaller wheel low ground clearance might problem , but that not concern me right now . overall , instep terrific value i would highly recommend it right price	1

before i bought this watch , i lot research offerings suunto , polar nike , finally ended up choosing lance 4 watch my cycling-specific activities . i say , my disappointment began within 2 minutes opening shipping box . here three major ways this watch ( nike itself ) failed me : 1 ) this complicated , multi-function instrument . but if you're expecting detailed instruction manual , forget it . what you get elaborate pictograph illustrates which buttons push . it skims over setup procedure many most important functions , omits many features entirely . 2 ) relative above complaint , i contacted nike customer service setup . since i'm cyclist , i particularly interested altimeter function , dismayed how thin " manual " . instructions say you select 60- , 10- or 2-second sampling rate barometric pressure order determine altitude . what it fails mention what ramifications choosing one over other ? one more accurate ? one use more battery power ? we'll apparently never know , because nike customer service failed answer question . while they admitted they received several complaints manual -- considering writing new one -- they simply sidestepped my question altimeter function their email reply . 3 ) then there performance watch itself . most cases it impressive -- , every case except one which i purchased it : altimeter . my group rides , there always least three other people altimeters . post-ride comparison altimeter results always puts their readings within 3 percent each other . results nike least 20 percent off . means altimeter results not trusted . while watch attractive ( that why it earned 2 stars instead just one ) excellent band , it simply doesn't give me accurate altimeter results i need . since altimeter results so far off , i only assume its built-in weather sensor ( also based barometric pressure ) hugely flawed , too . manual light information it , nike customer service either unwilling or unable shed any light watch usage flawed performance altimeter function , i only say this watch represents major disappointment . it may meet nike standards fashion , but it fails my standards performance	1

we bought our machine 2 weeks ago . it looks wonderful , nice sturdy , alot different features , but we haven't able use it . it didn't work day we brought it home fighting ironman customer service department ever since . they keep giving us runaround saying different technicians coming but nobody ever shows up . evertime we call their 1800 number we're hold least 30 minutes before we even get talk person then they just lie say they either call us back or someone out day . well after 2 weeks , we've it ! we're taking it back never buying ironman product again . they're nice machines good warrentys but what good it if they won't get anyone out there fix it ? nothing against store , they've great . just 2 big thumbs down manufacturer	-1
i purchased this bike rack because i moving out state didn't enough room back my car bike . i also needed rack transport my bike local trails , parks , etc . so , i went schwinn given brand name it relatively inexpensive . i drove nc fla , approx 700 miles , bad idea this rack . i didn't any trouble assembling rack , only took 5 minutes ready go . however , during my trip , i pull over side interstate no less than 5 times tighten straps back . buckles not hold straps place . this real problem if you travelling highway ( or any busy road ) you worry your bike flying off back into oncoming traffic . also , even if buckles hold , wind drag bike starts pull brackets right off rack frame . i purchase 4 bungee cords rope order secure my bike flying off back ( yes , rack assembled correctly ) . bottom line , this rack probably great value if don't plan driving more than few miles or over 40-50mph , otherwise , it complete waste .	-1

this stuff very strong smell -- like wd-40 or something . if you stand smell , you might well buy local hardware store -- least then you'd probably get little straw could used spray it under center your treadmill belt . i bought this stuff because i thought it would odorless , like all other treadmill lubricant i've bought . but it isn't odorless . it really stinks . i don't like permeating smell my house , especially my workout room . i recommend lifespan 100% silicone lubricant . it little pricier quantity you receive , but it good ( odorless ) stuff	-1
got mat free ordering series 7 treadmill while putting mat under my treadmill it ripped . it made this rubbery plastic , it just okay . i wouldn't pay $100 it , it true , but i very disappointed it ripped so easily . not very durable ... but i got mine free , so i guess i wasn't too surprised it given away .	-1
i guess you get what you pay . this pedometer difficult calibrate , continued miscount steps , therefore distance , covered . it made plastic , came unclipped easily . i am big person , started walking improve my health . this product not work me , although it might different story slim person . it relegated junk drawer , probably eventually thrown away . i'll find works better purchase it	-1
i gave this pedometer one star because it not anyone who wants use it straight off shelf . this pedometer work if you not mind working it . it problems need modification . top clip this pedometer pushes against body , making vertical angle 20 degrees or more off plumb . means weighted arm inside drags circuit board not move freely . remove factory clip tabs hold it . add some adhesive velchro back case . make fabric band your ankle . attach ends each other velchro . put strip velchro outside band attaching pedometer band . i get accurate readings this pedometer when it attached inside my right ankle . i got inconsistent readings it my waistline . hair spring returns weighted arm its upright position weakened considerably after ten miles pedometer drastically undercounted . i opened pedometer added strut brace spring . strut made thin brass . aluminum soda would work , too . i made " " one end strut hold spring . i pushed lightly against spring left side , drilled hole brass , anchored strut screw lower left part circuit board . strut angles up just slightly screw anchors it . i now quite few miles pedometer . ( i theory spring weakened because its solder joint circuit board may broken slightly allowed spring twist freely . ) several times pedometer reset itself " 0 " no apparent reason . i know nothing pushed reset button . one incident while it going through scanner airport security . once it reset while i walking . twice it reset while i napping sofa . i am thinking charge static electricity overwhelmed circuit , but i not know . static electricity too many synthetic fabrics problem more expensive pedometers , too . this pedometer uses counter circuit . if someone needs inexpensive electronic counter , connect wire weighted arm wire coiled spring it contacts . connect button switch two wires . freeze weighted arm place hot glue	-1

i so frustrated those so called " sticky mats " , my hands would slide forward simple poses like downward facing dog . so i decided give $50 skidless yoga towel try . this worked pretty well my slipping hands , but i new problem . i unable get traction my feet felt though they would slip up when many commonly practiced poses yoga . ( downward facing dog , even poses like triangle extended side angle ) . i really tried giving this towel chance but ended up purchasing harmony yoga mat ( those rubber mats ) which greatly reduced my slippery yoga experiences . i would not recommend skidless towel your entire mat , maybe you may better luck just hand towel . i realized yoga mats every person different , so what doesn't work me , may work you . i just thought i would give my 2 cents	-1

if you just like cruiser look use bike only occasionally very short rides ( less than 10 miles ) then this probably not bad bike . but , if you want much more comfortable efficient bike , one fit your body properly , go your local bike shop ask see their " hybrid " bikes . this type bike gets its name cross " road bike " " mountain bike " or " all terrain " bike . they available several frame sizes , so you're not stuck " one-size-fits-all " , which not good if you shorter than 5'7 or taller than 5'10 . hybrids available wide range prices equipment selections . price range just over $200 high you want go ( over $1500 anyway ) . price goes up , weight generally goes down quality frame all components goes way up . but even low end scale , hybrid much more efficient bike ride ( more miles covered per energy expended ) it more comfortable longer rides ( over 10 miles ) . if you truly interested covering some longer distances ( up maybe 30-40 miles ) focus models feature 700c wheels opposed 26-inch -- your bike shop person explain -- keep tire width down 35mm or under ( 28mm good size most people if they ride only pavement ) . narrower tires offer less " rolling resistance " making bike easier pedal larger wheel sizes improves efficiency little also . happy peddaling , very experienced cyclis	-1

my daughter 38 " 30lbs . it perfect size her . we mainly use it something lay while watching tv or reading books floor . pros- when " chair position " , it tall enough accommodate taller children . - cover removeable washable- comes handy pink storage bag ( although it kinda hard fit pump bag bed)- pretty easy convert into chair ( there 2 straps each side bed need " connected " order change it into chair - they color coded ) . might hard young children figure out how it . - inside sleep bag made soft material ( although it appears though it may snag easily ) . - large zipper located one side sleep bag . easy small hands use . - weight limit : 100 lbscons- pump very cheaply made it takes long time inflate bed ( it operates use foot motion or you use your hands ) . - air slowly leaks out bed . we actually thought ours hole it when purchased , so we exchanged one . but this one too deflates pretty quickly . example : if we completely inflate 7pm , 8am next morning it needs inflated again because it loses 40% it air . - adult help needed change into chair . - adult help needed inflate . overall : it bit pricey quality i expecting . it would nice if adult assistance wasn't needed change bed chair back . defitely would work extra sleeping spot night , but it takes time inflate requires adult so	-1

field bag claims " perfect way get baseball game going " . while this may true , number games you actually play this set one ( if set even makes it through game ) . first off , these bases you must set up field using wooden mallet pound flimsy plastic stake into ground . one my sets ( i bought 3 unfortunatly same time not knowing their reputation ) , wooden mallet wasn't even glued together , it fallen apart so i just use head . then when i put stakes into ground , out 3 sets i , least 1 each set broke while i placing them . actually place bases , set gives you string device helps you measure out field . this handy except fact it took me 10 min untangle mess then when i went second base realized string not long enough . granted , one could place 1st 3rd then figure out where 2nd went but picture set-up shows string measure base ; however , it definintely not right length . after placing bases team now ready play . however , don't wear cleats these bases . bottom base says , not recommended use cleats boy they right ! our game we tball children using bases even their little cleats ( not all kids cleats ) tore them shreds . our bases lasted one hour before they torn inside cotton coming out . it very unfortunate seeing though we purchased three sets all end hour . this non-profit won't see money again :) so unless you plan using these bases grass easy set-up , not plan wearing cleats , not playing true game baseball/softball .... you would probably better off buying $8 flat bases temporary use ( they left outside afterward too ) . - just not impressed , sorr	-1

i ordered two these high hopes , utterly disappointed . first design battery holders bad . they supposed hold two cell batteries . when i tried get one , i initially concluded different size must requried , it seemed size wouldn't fit . after much futzing around , i managed get two cells without hopelessly bending flimsy contact springs . this one now works but i doubt i could successfully remove replace batteries again . battery holder too flimsy . second unit contact wire which connects two far ends batteries fallen out its plastic holder . after 15 minutes trying put it back i gave up . this unit totally unusable . nothing pyramid package label indicates two batteries , cell size , needed but not included . second this fender mount light , meaning if you want mount it your handlebar there no way hardware included . while pyramid box say " fender mount , " description not included online product description . , this light batteries installed fairly heavy . lightweight plastic fender my front bike tire would not come close supporting this light , i doubt many bike fenders these days would . why would anyone sell this bike headlight without including handlebar mount ?? i'm totally disgusted this flimsy product , vendor who sold it me	-1

i am writing this review hippo clubs general . i purchased simmilar set amazon year ago because it $300 set or irons reduced $100 . i interested graphite shafts ( all i ever used steel ) wanted cheap set travel ( i 2 different sets clubs lost during travel ) . first thing i noticed these clubs my miss-hits rose dramatically . clubs looked nice enough , but their performance less than par . when i talked my club pro , he said problem buying graphite shafted clubs inexpensive like these hippos shafts cheap not consistant . your average pro plays graphite shafts cost up $80 each . he also indicated me high handicappers tend buy cheap clubs ( which humbling fact i swallow ) , high handicappers tend play better steel shafts . all this said , i chalked up my $100 mistake began looking locally all golf shops high-quality pre-owned clubs . after 2 weeks , i found hardly used set ' 04 big berthas $359 . i talked salesman down $299 walked out best set clubs i ever hit . i guess my point if you looking these clubs , you either new or relatively unskilled player -- like me . if this case , take some time search out high-quality pre-owned or used equipment make your learning curve my shorter . let golfers get new clubs every two years spend $600-$1000 new sets . take advantage their trade-ins . that my opinion anyway	-1

(-_-) he filled up 110-shot mag , winded it up , aimed , same thing resulted , only this time , spray lasted longer than 3.5 seconds . out maybe 50 shots fired , 12 hit . i checked gun all around , but it not defective all , except part this gun made very cheaply . my brother tried it semi-auto , which usually more accurate . not this gun , though . fact , semi-auto even less accurate than automatic feature !!! out 10 shots , one or two hit ! i couldn't tell because this gun 140 fps made barely sound when it hit target !

this bench bit joke , unfortunately . put bench together myself , i tell you most flimsy part bench part you sit : it particle board wrapped thin vinyl sitting two very small pieces metal , balanced over main structure . i feel foolish buying this bench . shoddy construction fact bench supposedly rated maximum total weight 300lbs -- including you weight you're lifting , i think it would mistake purchase this . maximum width this bench only 3 feet . it narrow . small .	-1
overall , system useable but there multiple areas potential improvement . most important area improvement height weight bench . it too high so there no way perform traditional bench press . second , pegs hold weight bar place positioned where one would normally place their hands . there no way around this other than narrowing your grip . fly bars awkward tend bang against bench support . lateral pull bar provides resistance through some palstic housing which i am pretty sure wear out short period time . weight bench basically relegated my off day strength work outs since it not provide stability support vigorous weight session .	-1

even though they look pretty cool , these mirrors hard focus , even harder see anything	-1
i hate complain too much since this pretty cheap item , but just warn others - i bought this because i wanted ab bench . it really doesn't suit purpose too well since it one incline position only abs - other positions just back support working dumbells . ab position pretty weak doesn't really work your abs well abs only bench would , plus it bit uncomfortable other reviewer said , if you anywhere near 6 ft tall or over , get something else . combined shipping - this waste almost 100 bucks here - while usable , it really won't make impact your workouts . i few sets situps really don't feel tightness i would if i used real bench or even just sat floor matter . if you're budget , this may work if you put something under front base put it greater incline and/or situps holding weights - make sure you pad it blanket or something - position just too awkard . fact it multipurpose bench takes away it effective ab bench - real ab benches one smooth incline , not perpendicular seat bends down halfway which really stretches your back bit too much direction it not supposed bend lol	-1

no where amazon say their description , this comes completely disassembled ! i purchased other exercise equipment you usually put handle bar or stabilizer . so here it sits it box like big paper weight middle my floor . amazon not paying return shipping i not afford spend half amount purchase return it . buy your big purchases someone who unconditional paid return policy . this may good machine , but i never find out .	-1
this product ineffective . snorkel gets stuck , either open so water pours while you're trying breathe , or stuck shut so you cannot take breath air while under water . it very distressing when you're out deep water snorkelling breathing tube fails perform ! i often take mouthfuls water , or worse ; suck breath air get nothing ! it therefore useless , i stopped using tube it more trouble than good . i bought two sets , one my partner one myself , they both fail perform . mask one set broke after 2 months ( metal pin became dislodged ) tightening clips flippers frequently fall off while trying tighten them your feet . bag zippers rusted not long after use ... given most people snorkel salt water , you think they would considered rust proofing metal . overall quality these not-so-cheap kits embarrassingly bad . we both felt awkward snorkeling them , sometimes i even felt they hazardous . we tossed these products bought cressi brand gear . it changed our underwater experience	-1
i just came accross this ad , thought say something price this item . please aware many other merchants sell this product half price .	-1
this fly night workout machine looks great pictures videos but when you take it out box , you realize it poorly cheaply constructed . i own ton excerise equipment this only piece equipment i return ... i purchased so much internet this past year very happy all my products . until i purchased this ab-doer which total waste time money . tension arms unit way too flimsy loose ... foam around arms also very cheap foam fact my daughter used it " once " there already small chunk foam came off unit ... she not even long nails ... bars connect seat bottom unit stay place ok when your it , but they not lock base when your not it so if you pick-up unit move it , it collapses ... what really bad so called back massager located main area center stem . it nothing but hurt your back worthless ... even adjusting bar different heights joke ... it screw , not quick disconnect ... this one those products make ton money mass advertising but quickly fad out fast unless there major changes this unit ... it sad when you watch some those excercise info-mercials all these people great bodies may fooling you into believing products really work ... i couldn't find any reviews these until now ... i never again buy product without reading reviews customer themselves . we best source honesty market ... save your money or just some sit-ups leg raises if you ... they work sooooo much better than this product !!! if you some searching , you see some bad reviews this product coming ... based amazon review rules , i cannot list where i read them ... great day everyone !!!	-1

i went sports store all they carried sportline pedometers . i really didn't know which one buy so i bought this one because it more attractive than bright yellow one it more expensive than 340 so i thought it better somehow . even though it says it measures steps accurately packaging , it doesn't actually display it . it only uses it calculate distance you've walked . i very annoyed this because 340 track display number steps walked . i got over it but thing keeps resetting my pocket . i'm just going buy pedometer . one displays steps walked cover	-1
medicine ball ordered gift when it arrived , it very scuffed up scratched . it also flat spot it . i returned it replacement , which i got , it same condition . also packaging tore if it opened before . i would recommend buying store so you look it . we also same experience above 6 lb . medicine ball same outcome . definitly not happy it	-1

sportline 353 talking pedometer works ok pedometer fm radio , but it 2 issues . good : talking part this pedometer turned off or . it nice hear when you rolling , " 9000 steps . " fm radio very elementary , but functional . there no dial tune . you push button it rolls next station . there volume control earphones . pedometer uses aaa batteries purchased anywhere . bad : pedometer constantly slipping off my waistband bouncing floor . it didn't break , but it very annoying . several times it popped off w/o me knowing i left it restaurant or friend car . ugly : if i accidentally bumped reset button - kitchen counter or arm chair - pedometer lost day count went back zero . pedometer not memory feature - so tally lost . this would sometimes happen 2-3 times day . very frustrating . clip broke after 3 months -- so i retired it . i bought omron hj112 premium pedometer very pleased it . it teather so if clip slips off my waistband , pedometer dangles -- it not bounce floor . it 7-day memory feature automatically resets midnight . it clock . it uses button battery . it not radio it doesn't talk , but it works works well . sportline would good if it teather , clip didn't break so easily , reset button could not pushed accidentally .	-1
all this air pump let out what little air may your tyres . i can't think anything else i ever bought completely useless this . it toy , pretending air pump . nonfunctional lever top ( mentioned other reviewers ) indicates it designed toy . i'm just happy i trying put air my tyres driveway , not out trail . past , i bought number bell products , including motorcycle helmets . i now shudder think what might happened if i put one them test	-1

scary looking but inpractical . wooden handle it too thick unless you already extra large hands already ( if your fists big you don't need claws ) . talon shaped blades sharp but can't dig , they only scratch . they even hard time cutting through multiple layers cardboard . nice wall decor but nothing more	-1
i used pedometers few years . i initially impressed this pedometer but then i discovered 360 i received not always ' wake ' keep track steps . 360 i received not always count steps even when already ' awake . ' ' sleep ' ' wake ' feature bogus , it not work it makes this pedometer loser . i would not surprised if other users this pedometer simply overlooked fact their steps might not getting counted because pedometer stuck sleep . heartrate monitors , company i bought it not responsive when i asked guidance . i bought pedometer different dealer , sportline 345 - it my second 345 , need i say more	-1
im new airsoft wanted couple pistols screw around friends , found these . i probably just expected too much out them , $8 gun you shouldnt expect too much . well , me friend began shooting each other , bbs curved largely left . not just little , but one them made near diagonal line left . they're really light ( although expected cheap guns ) really clumsy feel . they least look kind neat , plastic orange tip mainly hidden attached compensator ( looks only ) . i later bought $30 gun meijer it shoots nearly twice far , shoots straight . these just useful if you too many people not enough guns . dont expect win these , unless you're fighting other people same thing . note , my friend pushed down magazine release it snapped off . he wasnt pressing hard , it just weak defective plastic .	-1
leather/pleather outting glove soo thin if you plan doing any sparring plan it tearing . i used them once tearing occured during padwork sparring . i would recomend getting glove thick leather so you know it last through beatings	-1

bought mine sometime around christmas took it into water first time trip st thomas last week . it died within 10 minutes water . it never more than 5 ' down while i snorkeling . while i never tested compass or thermometer against known " accurate " ones , it seemed work well enough my purposes . just keep it dry	-1
return first one due non-functioning thermo fault compass . small nice hanging it keys or pack , but same smallness makes it little hard opwerate one handed . i also brunton compass fits hajnd much nicer . we'll see how long 2nd one lasts	-1
i ordered this gun because it such great deal . when it arrived , i took it out box barrel cracked ( big crack ) , nothing little gorrila glue can't fix though . also accuracy isn't consistent , it always 4 or 5 inches off 20-30 feet . i put back part laser off sliding mechanism get it accurate , otherwise it 3 feet high . pellet also starts curve after 15 feet or so too . so this gun good deal but isn't best quality gun i've . you load it top gun , which means taking off laser , putting bbs , putting laser again . magazine doesn't even come off ! it still decent speed , isn't crap ( it just bad ) . it worth 15 bucks though	-1
others mentioned already , i found this thing very , very " wobbly " . i never , ever felt comfortable riding my ( almost 4-year-old ) son this thing . it just felt too unstable . i returned this after only few days	-1

i different experience than other reviewer . i would also consider myself beginner golfer , but medicus not worked me . it might work if you never picked up golf club you learning first time , but if you trying improve your swing it doesn't help . you develop way swing club without breaking hinge , but it still bad swing . i heard golf pro it good if you already solid swing you trying improve it , but not good beginners .	-1
i notice several other reviews mentioning faulty/defective consoles arriving . well , i received my first schwinn 438 month ago . i put it all together , realized they not ship ac adapter machine . i contacted amazon , they told me either send machine back or contact manufacturer . i contacted manufacturer saturday , they closed . i contacted them following monday they told me item back order , but , i could buy compatible adapter radio shack . i . i came home excited use my elliptical , unfortunately , console nothing but beep me .. very frustrating . i contacted manufacturer again , they advised me console backorder would not delivered least 2 months . they recommended i send unit back amazon replacement . i so . i spent better part night taking thing apart repackaging it ... quite job trying squeeze it back box . 3 weeks later , i received my second elliptical . same faulty console problem , after spending couple hours putting thing together . contacted amazon demanded full refund return . they pick unit up , not make me take it all apart this time , but , i am still awaiting full refund . i since purchased vision fitness elliptical real fitness shop my area . i am extremely happy unit , although it few hundred bucks more . this one horrific experience amazon . i wouldn't recommend buying this product , seems like they shipping out defective units	-1

accessories come this nice great , albeit somewhat impractical ( who going use slingshot , anyway ? ) , but thing stands out most this knife plastic handle . survival knives hollow handles go either way far usefulness quality , but this handle cheap , brittle feel it suggests easy breakage . it not too hard conceive blade could break off handle under enough stress , which makes this blade dangerous one use . not buy this knife , or any other knife hollow plastic handle	-1

call this bad machette would generous . it more accurately described machette shaped object . other noted blade thin , too flexible , easily rusts , fails hold edge . handle poorly made mine sharp edges where handle halves joined . if you use it without wearing gloves this " tool " more dammage your hand than target vegetation . th sheath material 1 step above paper . technically it hold machette your belt . but if you draw machette anything other than utmost care you cut sheath . i can't believe company valuable name like coleman would put their brand this embarassing piece garbage .	-1

i bought supra model gazelle sears 179.00 . i thought it so light shock absorbers made good form resistance . well after year welds cracked shock absorber holders useless so i took them off . guy sears(where i bought junkpiece ) says , " ew , man too bad " !! remember light tubuler construction while making ease transport also means ease breakage . machine meant looking good leotards sipping sports drink put it away if you start sweating . if you dont sweat rust out weld joints who knows where you'll catapulted when next thing it goes . maybe maybe tony little give surprise visit you hospital !	-1

not buy this gun hot import toys . my main point . it took very long time get me ( 8 days ) when it , it broken . not it shattered or it jammed . it just didn't work . piston seemed fine , motor seemed connected , gearbox seemed tact , batter ( although little hard install ) charged , trigger connected gear box . i thought i could return it either working gun or just refund . no . i e-mailed hit over 7 times over course couple weeks . nothing ! i got no response , no notification , nothing . i continued e-mailing them because they didn't even post phone number reach them their site ! hit worst company buy ever ! what i see know , this gun seems quite mpeg ! i would loved use it its fullest my friends but unfortunately , i bet you anyhting hit decide wait until 30 day warranty expired before they e-mail me back : telling me how warranty time up they aren't allowed exchange my product . buy airsplat !!! trust me . this good gun . fast , accurate , good looking . not waste month your time waiting it arrive , find its broke , waiting them e-mail you back , then live broken , useless piece potential airsoft gun . so trust me , don't buy hot import toys	-1
i ics m4a1 . i am basing my thoughts this based what some airsoft forums i am registered said this . i am registered arnies , airsoft core , airsoft retreat . 1 ) this gun very , very unreliable company ( well ) , so you more chances getting bad gun than you getting good one . this common knowledge among airsoft community . 2 ) lets say you buy 4 these guns ... each them costing 100 dollars . even over 5-10 year span , adds up lot money spent gun breaks consistantly . people who skirmished lpeg ( low-powered electric gun ) find exterior actually break if shot aeg shoots 330 fps . 2g ( standard companies like toyko marui , ics , classic army , gg , airsoft elite ) . one thing this suggests gun badly made . 3 ) gearbox ( part gun fires bbs ) broke mine . short , it metal gearbox , made cheapest metal known man . purpose this company makes this get money . it very , very weak . definitely not worth it . 4 ) " hop-up " this gun non-existant . fundamentals hop-up backspin added bbs increase range accuracy . effective range this- 50 feet ( not meters ) . effective range my ics m4a1 ( aftermarket tightbore added ) 150 feet . 5 ) this gun get laughed . some children walk into organized skirmish this lpeg , telling people it own all others , they cry home when players real aegs destroy them . i suppose it fine backyard wars , but who earth would spend 100 dollars crappy gun backyard wars ? 6 ) cost not equal quality . if you think all accessories come this gun ( light , laser , ect ) , then account shipping china , then packaging costs ( pre-molded styrofoam ) , you realize this gun very , very cheaply made . you not want spending so much so little quality . laser itself sell 20 dollars . put it short , it not worth it	-1

description bike misleading . weight limit person using this exercise bike should part description . small print booklet accompanying bike says it unsafe more than 250 pounds . although i weigh slightly less than this , i am afraid use bike fear it falling apart . i would not purchased bike i seen this limit description . also , directions operation this bike very complicated . i thought i purchasing simple exercise bike , not such complicated piece machinery . this bike would perfect younger , more athletic , slimmer person	-1

if i could give them 0 stars , i would . i don't know why they even still make these , they should illegal -- so should all laminated foam rubber stuff they use karate . materials break up easily ; stuffing shifts starts flying all over place . i could give tens reasons why these not only inferior , but complete garbage right out box . everlast general simply isn't good : low quality materials , design workmanship , but these win prize all time worst sports equiptment my book . i recommend buying entirely ringside -- this coming experienced full-contact fighter	-1
our three year old twins received two these cars christmas . joystick control broke one cars one hour after they received them christmas day ! my husband ordered replacement car then shortly after , other cars ' joystick control broke ! so , now we stuck two broken cars one work , but wondering when one break too ! i need mention kids not particularly rough cars ; we right there when other car broke not witness any rough behavior . controls cheap break eventually . cars very loud , but positive side , kids love them provide fun entertainment them . i would definitely not recommend this product	-1

i bought these gloves my wife who problems keeping her hands warm . description gloves would you believe battery powered gloves ( using cell batteries ) would provide heat hands 6 8 hours . actuality , battery only provide heat 35 40 minutes before it ends . make matters worse , only heat provided palm hand , no heat provided fingers ! i not use cheap brand battery these gloves . first battery i tried ( it takes one cell per glove ) duracel experation date 2013 ( other words , brand new battery lots shelf life left ) . battery provided heat 40 minutes before dying . second set batteries i tried ( same experation date ) made eveready . battery lasted 35 minutes . you should also note duracel fits poorly connector case eveready battery fits even worse ! these gloves their way goodwill . maybe they used some one work gloves or something . if you considering these gloves , think again ! chemical packs work much better although they ( chemical packs ) shelf life . it just seemed such waste us use chemical pack one hour walk then pack continue provide heat 4 6 hours . still , better than using up two cell batteries less heat only lasts 40 minutes .	-1

i don't recall ever quite disappointed product i am swing groover ii . last night i went driving range check some yardages my clubs , just so i could verify accuracy swing groover . i hitting my 5-iron 180-190 yards most time , occasionally hitting 200 . my 7-iron flying 165 yards . tonight , i just finished setting up swing groover . my first few swings 5-iron produced readings 133 yards . i warmed up little more started hitting 7-iron . these swings produced readings 121 yards , average 121 . this product designed indicate swing speed yardage hit . yardage off 50 yards , but believe it or not , i think swing speed indicator probably pretty accurate . 5-iron , it indicating little over 70 mph . i've my speed tested before driver it registered little over 100 mph , so this number 71-73 5-iron sounds reasonable . i'm not sure if i just got defective machine or what exactly problem , but i'm very disappointed . i'm very inclined think i just wasted $150 . my suggestion keep looking other products , because this one horribly inaccurate	-1

i purchased kurt kenetic two months ago , am thrilled its performance quality . if you considering purchasing trainer , fluid trainers way go . basically , there four major types trainers : magnetic , wind , rim driven , fluid . later best , hands down ! fluid resistance trainers more quiet , smoother more realistic than any others mentioned . only drawback fluid trainer over time they leak resistance fluid . there three companies solutions this drawback . i highly recommend you research all three test them out where possible . good review page roadbikereview.com . cycleops fluid 2 ultra smooth quiet . they limmited warranty thier products , but known standing behind their trainers life , fix any issues probably life ! one up trainer all advantages fluid trainer , but uses no fluid its designe , it made america carries life time warranty . kurt kinetic , which i decided purchase , imho , best because it utilizes sealed fluid unit therefore guranteed not leak . these three units roughly same price , around $260.00 . steep ? think it this way , this product going your companion many winters , so don't buy loud , crappy one crappy customer service ! you'll regret later you didn't spend extra $75 or $80 quality product . i also tested blackburn fluid , $100 bucks cheaper , not bad price , but since it new market i unsure durabillity or how well they stand behind thier trainers after warranty expiration . i heard amazing testimonials how cyclops , kurt , one up , replaced parts even whole trainers , no questions asked ! google these three companies see yourself	1

little caveat -- this review actually exact same flooring system 1'x1 ' size tiles ( which worked out better me because they little more flexible terms configuration smaller space ) . said , these floor mats really great ! i wanted create home gym space doing floor aerobics step workouts well pilates , yoga , weighted workouts , etc . these fit bill absolutely perfectly !!! they stiff enough there no danger ankle instability because too-soft surface , but they soft enough when you floor work , they provide excellent cushioning . my knees used kill me when i would runner stretch , but now i actually go " ahhhh " i'm doing them , which great . not even smidge discomfort . they also really great absorbing jarring high-impact activities . talk ankle , knee , hip saver ! only discomfort i still notice i really think it just me ) during floorwork when i'm my side leg lifts , i some problems area greater trochanter ( bony prominence top femur ) . but i am very sensitive area due running marathon recently , so again , i really think it just me . anyway , i just can't say enough good things these mats -- i highly recommend them . now -- address title my review ..... my only complaint mats -- i'm echoing recent reviewer this -- when i first put them down , they slid all over place my hardwood floors . because they not completely wall-to-wall configuration i them , this problem . i able solve problem completely , though , buying one those sticky under-carpet anti-slip pads you get very inexpensively . i found yoga sticky mat placed underneath trick , well . but i would put 3 yoga sticky mats underneath cover enough surface area keep it slipping . short , if you hardwood floors like me ( i don't know how they would perform carpet or other surface ; you'd see review check ) , i highly recommend these mats without reservation -- provided you willing shell out tiny bit extra dough get anti-slip pad put underneath . also , if you , sure get one covers whole area mat ( or very close it ) . otherwise , if you come down part that not protected during lateral move , you may find yourself sliding across room losing your balance . little expensive , but really worth investment my opinion . happy sweating you ( or whatever activities you plan use mats ) . :	1

i like how this thing folds up nicely so after scooting around downtown ( kid , not me ) i could fold it up when we enter grand central market without hitting anyone shins . age requirements , manufacturer recommends 5 years age . i say that right but get padding every possible body part make sure teach her/him how fall correctly ... ie , not unpadded body parts like your hands ... red works boys girls ... so if you're thinking pink or blue one some reason it double price stick this ..	-1

we looking light-weight backpacking tent enough room two . seems simple enough , unless you've actually inside some " two-person " tents . some expedition tents meet size requirements , but too heavy considered backpacking tents . we just used this tent first time , we so far pleased . plenty room inside two adults large sleeping mats sleeping bags , bit gear . large vesitibule each side provides plenty room packs . i believe this great warm-weather tent , all mesh . night we used it , it dropped below freezing . we woke ceiling ( rainfly ) covered ice ( inside ) . didn't really expect , all ventilation , but it ice , it didn't drip us . i'll chalk this experience up extreme conditions until we use it warmer weather . one thing i don't like , although thus far it not issue , seam running through middle floor . it taped sealed factory , but i just don't like looks it . i seal it again before spring use , edit this report , we sure end up downpour here south texas . tent fact lightweight roomy , so far , i am pleased . i amend this report after enountered weather it	1

i after drooling over this watch two years wishing i one , i finally got one my advizor two months now . all i say if i known how cool this thing really , i would shelled out $300 long time ago . each one features listed above everything you could want . heart rate monitor target zone settings , average workout heart rate , highest lowest hear rate , more . altimeter tells your rate ascent , total vertical climb stores all data recent workouts memory . coolest feature it store your heart rate , altitude rate ascent/decent intervals 20 seconds ten minutes so after workout you scroll though see how your heart rate affected altitude acent rate . i got completely geeky this information after one workout , i typed it all into my computer so i could see what it looked like . only drawback advizor it gives you so much information , it would great if you could download it directly computer analysis . there no pc link , so any analysis watch or typed hand . but other than , this gizmo perfect . no problems all so far i use thing two workouts day . i am cross country ski racer long time i thought this would perfect training aid endurance athletes now i tried it i know it	1
when product came i realized it wasn't what i looking fanny pack but i impressed its rugged construction . i needed pack walk around disney world thought two water bottle holders would come handy . i like freeze my store bought water bottles so they stay cold all day . water bottles come this pack double wide wide top - meaning you can't wrap your lips around it like store bought bottle . plus you wash refill them opposed just buying dasani . unfortunately , you can't use water bottle holder anything much narrower than included bottles because there just single strap across bottom preventing their bottle falling through but wouldn't stop regular 16 oz . job slipping passed . so i'm returning mine , but if your looking non breakable , wide mouthed water bottles , rugged waistpack then this you . ps some reason blue one cheaper , least when i bought it	-1

i hate feed into mentality causes knifemakers hype their blades " tactical , " because last thing we need give lawmakers excuse heroically protect us banning tools we carry . but first last thing i say ken onion tactical blur it one fearsome knife . curved blade would suited your usual cutting slicing applications , such skinning mastodons so . this knife , other hand , chisel-like tanto point , which ideal thrusting effortlessly through beef ribs or car hoods . it would equally home cutting up cardboard boxes , linoleum flooring , or metal garbage cans . technically , this isn't switchblade . switchblades bad . we know this because our lawmakers heroically protected us effectively banning them various levels . this only ordinary liner-lock knife spring-assisted opening . but if i ever found switchblade deployment speed cutting power blur , i'd say it quite knife . blade shaving-sharp factory , handle lightweight but sturdy aluminum some kind gritty sandpaper-like stuff glued give better grip should knife become slippery any sort fluid . use your imagination . i haven't tried shattering any cinderblocks it yet , but it sturdy enough use yawara stick pinch . folded , whole package palmed even my small hands feels much like disposable lighter glandular problem . i don't even notice it my hip pocket , which where it rides whenever i happen wearing pants . if walking around something this fearsome seems too naughty you , remember couple things . one you buy it wall $55 , wall would not sell naughty things naughty people . crimes , my knowledge , not generally committed knives like these , but such evil implements kitchen knives , screwdrivers , whatever happens lying around near crime scene . lastly , you probably not need knife this fast ferocious , but if you , you * really * need it . you'll it	1

i've carrying using these swiss army spartans ( or similar model ) 35 years . bought my first germany couldn't get without it now . great quality just everything you could want daily use . it small enough light enough it comfortable carry . doesn't all useless " bell whistles " you'd probably only use if you 12 year-old boy scout . only problem ( mine , not knife ) i tend lose one every 6-7 years ... so i bought 2 this time so replacement next time it grows legs walks away . great feature optional eyeglass screwdriver than purchased fits neatly ( via threaded handle ) into corkscrew	1

despite some trepidation after reading reviews owners who unpleasant experiences sg4 , i bought it am glad i . my experiences using sg4 during play very positive , even though occasion weather conditions so bad i could only get signal some holes . large screen allows user easily see each obstacles given hole know distance them distance required carry them . sg4 also provides more detailed view each obstacle well distances front edge , center , rear edge each green . golfers who like know exact distance they hit each their clubs , " mark " feature marvelous . able all this valuable information available 10 professionally measured courses 5 personally measured courses significant value golfers who play number different courses not only regular basis but also courses played first time . sg4 also memory card slot able download more courses when service offered future . i think downloading procedures sky golf web site somewhat confusing but not very difficult figure out use only few minutes effort . i know several low mid-handicappers who love this device , i share their enthusiasm opinion -- i am high handicapper . i also own bushnell pinseeker 1500 slope consider sg4 far superior " tool " bushnell . note : there least one additional cost buyers incur after they receive their sky caddie -- subscriber fee downloading courses 1 year . fees range $30 courses measured one state you designate $80 worldwide use	-1
those who may new suunto , they wris t-t op computers designed manufactured finland use all over world hikers , bikers outdoor enthusiasts all kinds . what makes x-lander stand out first glance , obviously its sheer size . let there no illusions , x-lander mighty big watch . despite its size , it doesn't feel big it looks , though . aluminum case very light quite comfortable , too . next thing you notice would huge amount bells whistles packed into such small device . #1 . accurate altimeter . this invaluable tool avid hiker biker . one thing you must ready remember adjust it daily . find out what altitude set watch before you begin your trip , then end day you need make note where you stopped ( which you internal recording function ) properly adjust it before setting out next day . this not flaw , every single altimeter watch i am aware exactly same . #2 . barometer . i found it correct least 75% time , which more than i say local tv weatherman . this includes thermometer well , which order accurate must removed your wrist least 15 minutes order not get false reading due lingering body heat . #3 . digital compass . this truly one amazing feature , way . once you calibrate it ( which you may need weekly ) you never lost -- especially if you know how use map . #4 . it tells pretty accurate time , too believe it or not . it also comes alarm , countdown stopwatch . suddenly its size now makes sense , huh ? i happen like big watches . i don't exactly know why , but i just . if i any complaint whatsoever , one thing this watch lacking exactly what they included much less expensive vector : tiny little bubble which helps you level out watch compass mode more precise reading . reason why may fact x-lander mineral crystal vector plastic , but either way , it'd nice . i am very impressed just everything associated suunto their fantastic line what they call , wristop computers . if size really matter you , well you may wish go observer or maybe x6hr ( which everything x-lander observer plus it built-in heart-rate-monitor ) both smaller than x-lander , vector , yachtsman many other suunto models yet still offers lot -- but keep mind smaller size comes bigger price . factor all into your purchase plans once again , if all possible , not buy until you chance see some these ( or any ) models person . make huge difference how happy your purchase end up ... good luck !	1

" i shrugged jumper hauled surprisingly light ( it only 52 pounds ) box up stairs . sharp knife , pair nail clippers , thirty minutes several small drifts white packing material snow later , i my extreme pilates put together . first impressions , mat graphic cheesy , frame looks flimsy . however , this isn't just pilates trap table : leg spring hooks placed further back than they studio quality equipment , less likely get user way . push through bar won't drop if you let go it , because metal engineered not slide . there warning stickers use safety strap push through bar . overall , this safer machine than original . when you try use it , though , there few problems : i'm 5'4 " mat too short if you want roll down floor . springs light , i would suspect replacing them heavier ones might overload strength frame . it not clear which springs leg springs . lack clips just silly . said , i everything i trap table . i cat , swan saw push through bar , leg circles springs , chest expansion roll down bar , even magician series finish . kink my shoulder only goes away push through bar started work itself out . i could hear springs ( real springs , not bungee cords ! ) all ( briefly ) right world . this amazing piece equipment price . three caveats : not taller men ; it just too small . not serious athletes ; not enough resistance . not people children if you can't lock it away ; springs not safe little ones play .	-1

we slightly sloped yard so i hesitant getting trampoline . we tried it , it works fine ! my kids love it ! course , like any other toy , they take it spells but it still gets used alot after 6 months . i also concerned first them falling off it . i almost bought enclosure go it but i decided wait see how high they jumped , etc . this trampoline so small , they really can't get lot " air " so they don't flips other dangerous tricks . it also very low ground . i am glad now i didn't get enclosure . we don't really need it . i would recommend this trampoline younger kids . weight limit 120 lbs so it can't support larger kids . also , since it so small , we only let our two preschoolers jump together . when we guests over , it one time . i love it my kids want outside so much . this better money spent than video games , my opinion	1

bowflex one most amazing machines i ever used . its range exercises little creativity your part , you just any exercise you want . i completely recommend this if you don't time go gym or if you just really enjoy working out home . one disclaimer , don't think you get same results you get free weights . if you avid free-weight lifter , you get your kicks out maxing leg press perhaps even maxing bench . powerrods tension proportional amount bend you give them . thus , if you exercise 100 pounds resistance , but only move power rods through their first half bend , you aren't getting 100 pounds resistance . also , when you extend arms pulleys wide grip bench , you decrease amount bend rods point where , even if you bend them all way , you aren't getting full resistance . don't get me wrong , i love this thing ; i've mine past 2 years it amazing . i work out twice day 45 minutes hour each session , only because i don't time make it gym . get this if you very serious workout out home don't lot space fit other equipment . make sure you positive attitude going into lifting programs . experiment ideas different exercise movements . more than anything , this piece equipment blast use , fun it	1

i little skeptical gazelle first because it didn't look like you could get work out using it - but i wrong ! but let start beginning : it pretty easy set up - directions dvd great i could it all myself . i really excited use it so i hopped right ( i'm already used ellipticals ) enjoyed great workout . i sweating after watching training dvd , i worked my upper body lower body . i look forward using it tomorrow . now i don't drag myself gym . i work out home ! downsides : it squeak , but some wd40 or petroleum jelly should fix . it folds up but it not extremely portable . i it my living room currently . all all i recommend this product . i feel toning good diet weight training , you'll see results	-1
when product came i realized it wasn't what i looking fanny pack but i impressed its rugged construction . i needed pack walk around disney world thought two water bottle holders would come handy . i like freeze my store bought water bottles so they stay cold all day . water bottles come this pack double wide wide top - meaning you can't wrap your lips around it like store bought bottle . plus you wash refill them opposed just buying dasani . unfortunately , you can't use water bottle holder anything much narrower than included bottles because there just single strap across bottom preventing their bottle falling through but wouldn't stop regular 16 oz . job slipping passed . so i'm returning mine , but if your looking non breakable , wide mouthed water bottles , rugged waistpack then this you . ps some reason blue one cheaper , least when i bought it	-1
i got this accessory my door gym i like it . but , when they say this " efficient " accessory - they mean it . it simply rests narrower neutral grip posts door gym . door gym multiple grip areas , but two them perpendicular rest bar narrow neutral grip chin ups . broad reach bar wide downward grips ( like lat pull down bar gym ) . anyway , this works fine if you faith try it first time prove yourself it won't roll off because your body weight it pinned posts . it foam covering adheres foam door gym posts . it not roll easily , but it little . i think it safe adults who understand how use it . not give it kids younger than 15 ( my estimation ) because some them too likely play , or misuse , it get hurt . even though this thing works what you want broad bar let you , i deducted point rating because i don't think they up front explaining exactly what it not	-1

it suprisingly easy me put together considering i'm 110lb girl . it only took 3 hours but i trouble getting all screws get into their proper holes . it slightly rickitty however i go fast i want it won't brake or anything . it really nice able lose 200 calories while you watch your favorite t.v. shows . also , i am very tall i plenty space , it nice handle bars front either side . if you looking reasonably priced bike won't brake you , marcy good choice	-1
i got this bike i instantly liked it . only problem seat could not fit properly base . i tried many times tighten it up but doesn't help . well , other than its wonderful bike , zip noise would burn lot calories .........	-1
price this low-end home gym generally able things i wanted cheap home gym . however , there few issues you need consider before buying it . biggest issue ergonometric - this unit not designed used anyone over perhaps 5'10 " or 5'11 " . i'm 6'1 " this creates problems me . i find work-arounds use unit designed people smaller than me . problem form very important when doing exercises ( when you don't pay attention form , you either reduce effectiveness exercise or risk injury ) finding work-arounds sometimes compromises your form during exercise . there also few quality issues but these not entirely unexpected considering price unit . it would nice if bench padding little better but its adequate . two most annoying quality issues involve plate bars ( bars hold weights ) . this first issue plate bar lat tower ( cable ) unit . it wasn't level . this means weights keep trying fall off one side you put them . second issue also plate bars . unit designed accommodate standard plates ( small holes middle ) or olympic plates ( big holes middle ) . " sleeve " included unit slips over standard size plate bar enables one use olympic plates ( big holes ) . however outer diameter sleeve slightly smaller than standard olympic size so olympic size spring collar ( hold weights bar ) too big doesn't work . i went down home depot bought wood clamps hold plates place . kind pain but functional ( just work-around ) . if you buy this unit you probably want go standard plates ( small hole ) rather than olympic plates ( big hole ) . so i put this 4 stars because this price you really can't expect too much it generally delivers what i expected cheap home gym unit - one caveat : persons over 5'10 " should try find home gym designed taller people . since only 5% us population over 6 feet tall manufacturers tend design smaller people . if you're tall , good luck search	-1

i purchased this christmas my 8 year old son play . it $329 free shipping compared $450 local sports store . finished product looks great , appears rugged stable quite easy adjust . i only gave it 4 stars because assembly not easy , i am mechanically inclined . practically all holes needed drilled or reamed out order accept bolts directions ambiguous . it 4 hour assembly , filling base screened sand really taxing my patience . but smile 8 year old face well worth aggravation . side note , i ordered 70% my christmas shopping amazon , everything except this arriving before estimated delivery date ( everything else shipped ups ) . they shipped this via dhl , which never delivered package . i drive 120 mile round trip pick it up dhl facility take time off work friday before christmas retrieve my son primary gift . i emailed amazon requesting $70 credit reimburse me my time gas , which they few days . this oversized package i assume ups would not accept . nonetheless , their choice shippers reflects amazon company .	-1

i recently purchased pair gripmaster hand finger exercisers order help build forearm strength . i unsure which tension would appropriate , i bought one each light/blue ( 5 lbs . tension ) medium/red ( 7 lbs . tension ) grips . i've them little more than week now , i just love , love , love them ! perhaps that little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up exercise accessories , but i really enjoy grips . i leave one out my desk all times , get little work here there when i stop read document or whatnot . gripmaster exercisers different conventional grips you either work your entire hand once , or each finger individually ( great guitar players , i've heard ! ) . one side features four small levers , each its own spring , squeezed together or one time . plastic flip side molded together so you work your whole hand one unit . black rubber cushion removable , you place it either side grip . it awesome idea , allows maximum versatility ! just reference , i'm female , relatively good shape , but painfully little forearm strength ( my biceps huge years tae bo , though ! ) . 7 lb . medium/red grip do-able , but challenging . 5 lb . light/blue grip , other hand , makes much easier workout ; i oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things , i only feel it after number reps . if you're female not great shape , you'll want start out light/blue grips ( or even extra light/yellow ones ) , work your way up . out-of-shape guys probably get away medium/red ones start . if you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength , don't even both lighter tensions - skip ahead medium/red or heavy/black . although i've only owned my gripmasters week or two , can't personally vouch their durability , they seem sturdy well-crafted . my fianc brother , amateur boxer guitar player , used his years without problem , so i faith i'll squeezing these babies well into 2015 ! - kelly garbato , couch potato turned fitness fanati	1

i just wondering actual things this sword . ever since i seen game played it iv wanted sword sephiroth . but i want know actual information like even if edge beveled , it sharpend ? its steel 440 carbon ? it fall apart if its actualy used ? it full tang or half tang ? whats gaurd pommel made ? kinda thing . i just wanna make sure before i pay $100 it it used . please if anyone knows any these questions answer them me replying me envy_274@yahoo.co	1
hitch easy assemble easy use . we found it holds our bikes securely out scratching frames . straps easy fasten we like fact straps attached hitch so they not get lost . i also like fact bikes easy see my rearview mirror , but they don't obstruct my view or my taillights . it well designed product , but we modified holes hitch match our receiver so we could utilize locking hitch pin . this too nice rack leave unsecured vehicle . if you're hauling bikes , you probably going leave vehicle parked ride bikes . unless hitch locked or removed vehicle , it open easy thef t.t he hitch lightweight , but very strudy design . we also like it tilted gain access cargo area van . we hard time finding bike rack would hold five bikes . it easy fold up store garage . this great . well designed ! great product	1
i recently started casually lifting gym . after getting into heavier weights , i found my limits more based what pain my hands could take holding metal weights bars , instead what my muscles could lift . so i bought these gloves couldn't happier . now i focus lifting weight rather than worrying my hands getting torn up . i'm new weight lifting , but even light moderate weights these gloves make big difference . i'm sure other gloves would trick too , but these great price look . they run small , so order size up if you're uncertain	-1
surprised hubby his birthday he amazed very little assembly time needed . he enjoys pedaling around neighborhood , acting like little boy i know exists inside him	1
i grew up single speed bicycle later purchased 10 speed when they all craze hated it . it so very uncomfortable , nothing worked well , all those gears levers made me nuts . put end my recreational bicycle riding until now . i like this bicycle . this my first bicycle 20 years so i am amazed light weight this machine . electric blue paint briliant exciting , two my adult neighbors commented they really like style . i too ! i am 5'8 " , 175 lbs found this bicycle comfortable size me . riding position upright comfortable , just like it when i kid . no stooping over into racing position me ! 7 gears work easily smoothly easy rotating motion right hand grip . no more goofy levers me ! hand brakes work well quiet . no more squealing brakes me ! seat comfortable 2 hour ride chicago lake michigan bicycle path . no more skinny painful seats me ! tires fat ride smooth like they when i kid . no more skinny rough riding tires me ! i find this bicycle overall pleasureable riding experience . before you get me wrong , i am not against speciality bicycles or technology any way . i'm just not " technology victim " . i just want technology work me , i don't want pay " capability " i never use . i want comfortable ride keep up most pack , this bicycle meets those requirements me . bicycle arrived good condition secured shipping box very professionally . it took me while assemble machine ( foot pedals , handle bar assembly , seat assembly , front wheel , inflate tires ) adjust seat handle bar height . bicycle comes owners manual overwhelming amount assembly information mostly useless . most it pertains other models assembly already factory . if you few good tools , take your time , don't get overwhelmed printed material , little mechanical ability you get assembly few hours . my tips : make sure front fork facing correct direction ! i put it together backwards which made front tire hit my foot every time i turned handlebars . don't inflate front tire until after you install it frame . inflated tire never clear brake pads . inflate tires fully before you check see if brakes need adjusting . wheel rims shift slightly when tires inflated changing alignment brake pads , i need some adjusting front brakes . front wheel some wobble it but nothing serious . if you don't any mechanical ability some basic tools i would not recommend trying assemble this bicycle . you won't find this bicycle schwinn store , closest schwinn model they cost you almost double . four stars	-1
i purchased this after using friends it fantastic ! quality second none . it attaches you glasses easily stays put . it easy adjust just any direction . i would highly recommend anyone looking rearview mirrow biking	1

all five boxes arrived relatively good shape ... some punctures but not bad . internal components packaged styrofoam so they well protected . i decided xtreme2 after trying out bowflex se xtreme(1 ) . bowflex se seat very uncomfortable me didn't multi-pulley system like xtreme2 so it would require little more effort move cables around . i would recommend xtreme2 over se few hundred dollars more . setup took me 4 hours , but i moving slow pace so not miss any components . instructions pretty good . when assembled you see this real solid piece workout equipment . bowflex good job it . using it approx month am amazed many positions available probably lots more if you use your imagination . highly recommend xtreme2 those who know this machine they want . serious bodybuilders should go elsewhere because resistance totally different feel i know weights not compare one one bowflex versus free weights . anyone wanting put muscle tone this great machine . if your sole purpose get " huge " you should get some type power rack . i call bowflex three times some minor questions/comments they answered phone within 15 seconds each every time day or night . great customer satisfaction . one last thing , if you serious working out fairly strong , get 310 upgrade because it make changing out rods much easier you . look around prices too . also , one more comment ... i purchased 50 " x60 " rubber mat amazon approx $49 it pretty nice but i don't really think you need one bowflex since it sits only four corner legs nothing else touches floor anyway . you probably could get some small size pads . -try one out somewhere before you buy good luck	1
i think bowflex xtreme 2 awesome . i now it 2 weeks i really feel difference . i recommend this machine person serious good home work ou	1

i purchased wenzel twin air bed anticipation friend coming visit , not camping which probably its intended purpose . air bed very nice price , very functional easy set up . it took few seconds figure out manual pump , then few minutes fill it up ( get ready use little elbow grease ) . beds pretty short when fully inflated , so i would agree " buy two " suggestion if you're using them home . if you're using them camping only need get off ground , then you're probably more than fine single	1
after extensive analysis various battery 12v fan options , i decided purchase this product facilitate my cardio workouts . instead mounting fan dash automobile or boat , i attached it one specific piece equipment , lifefitness 9500hr elliptical machine . this aid cooling during my one hour/ 1,200 calorie workouts . this purpose , it excellent job . caframo ultimate 12v fan most powerful compact fan i identified thus far . exceptionally solid construction , it far sturdier than other 12v or battery fans i tested . quality components evident throughout design , highlighted large machined brass knob controls angle . other design elements questionable , however . one feature this fan i dislike it use exposed , soft fan blades . my particular application , this led vibration problem . realize power life required , i connected fan two ( 2 ) 9.8 volt rc batteries series total 19.6 . this arrangement , fan develops intense volume air . there quite bit vibration i assume due flapping blades . lack housing , which directs airstream , creates problem . any crosswind , however slight , severely limits fan effectiveness . it would seem almost impossible use this any outdoor application this reason . short , this one best consumer 12v fans available . however , you may want consider alternatives if fan subjected any disruptive airflows .	-1

like other reviewers said these made plastic . however said it high quality thick plastic , they never feel weak all . i weigh more than two reviewers before me ( 230lbs or so ) , but they still feel completely solid , so shouldn't any issue all . i like these bars couple reasons . one you lower your body below your hands , providing workout different muscles . second it lot easier put your hand around nicely padded bar then flat floor , so this makes whole setup easier . they also break down so you store them smaller areas , or even travel them . you wouldn't think it makes much difference , but it , well worth money	1

pogo stick very well-built . we first bought one locally , but some problems foam splitting . second one we bought here amazon . it came quickly , it no problems kids really enjoying it . one thing careful : there no packing or space around pogo stick ( after all it already foam-wrapped ) . since ends box heavily glued , you might thinking using knife open it . since pogo stick just under cardboard no protection , you use knife ... enough said . fact , packaging only reason i marked it down - it just too easy damage if you use any tools all open it . just rip it apart , you'll fine . highly recommended	-1
whoever claims they got hurt this stick , just fyi , its probably your own fault . it rocks just jumping up down , but it even better tricks . only problem it it wont stand up much abuse , i tried vert stall ate it hard hanlebar bent . but yo order replacement parts online so it okay . overall awesome stick	-1

i bike 3 weeks am happy overall . it very smooth quiet even when resistance increased . it also wide range resistance highest resistance providing more than i would ever need . but i couple issues mention . when bike arrived , one plastic feet rear stabilizer bar broken . i called manufacturer they immediated sent me replacement rear stabilizer bar . when arrived , one plastic feet broken it too . so i unscrewed good one replaced my broken one . apparently there quality control problem part . when working out i noticed slight click each revolution . it turned out coming one pedals . i tightened it down extra hard click went away . now , despite low frequency rumbling sound , it very quiet . i think sound normal , it certainly not interfere workout . it quiet enough i forget sound once i get going . seat hard little uncomfortable . i handle 30 minutes it which how long i am currently working out . maybe i buy new seat one these days . seat post looks standard so any seat should fit . but i would still buy it again if i choice . i paid $400	-1

while doing research online , i intrigued 40 lb weight vest priced approx . $75 , considering average retail price closer $200+ . i worried some reviews posted but decided give product shot . needless say , i pleasantly satisfied would recommend this product . vest itself number positives : first , fact weight conveniently compartmentalized into 35 or so small weight bags offers me lot flexibility terms weight adjustment configuration . i put weight high , center it my breastbone , or place it low . i found placing it different configurations actually changes my workout approach . second , i like fact i adjust vest solidly around my abdominal line , not worry shoulder area , which permanently stiched . third , i also like fact it broad shoulder straps , which helped distribute vest weight more comfortably . apparently , this " product differentiator " more expensive vests . stiching solid so far ... i concerned because vest made neoprene , but no problems so far . i feel it only few negatives : material neoprene takes little bit time get used , particularly its smell right out box . i am still concerned using neoprene b/c potential stich breaks ... my experience wetsuits makes me leery stiching neoprene , but fortunately there no zipper area or cuff areas may generate fraying . vest covers lot area , neoprene really makes you sweat when you work out . very careful using this product warm rooms or outside sun : hydrate . finally , since vest covers most my torso , i get strange looks gym when i come inside wearing vest ! thankfully , there logo front , but today day age , average fellow gym rat would probably double take make sure i'm not wearing some sort bomb vest . perhaps if they would offer different color , such grey or blue , it would make product more friendly public . overall , i thank gofit solid product very reasonable price point . i am former military man , who takes his workouts seriously , this item definitely enhance any fitness regimen . thanks reading !	-1

my son , now 20 months old , loved his cube since age 6 months . he very short attention span , but he easily play his cube 20 minutes time . it dropped he thrown it too many times count . today , battery cover popped off broke . i am hoping i glue it together make it work again . if not , i happily shelling out $29.99 replace his cube . it well worth money	1

even though hand guard doesn't fit , it excellent training sword ; i accidentally smashed my friend training sword half this one ^__^ ;;;; it take lots abuse , but it starts look sort rough when paint begins coming off use time . it great practice sword ; it heavy , 5-7 pounds , so it also good learn control sword so you don't stab yourself mid-swing .	1
i enjoy this workout . it quick , efficient different previous firm dvds , most which i . i consider myself advanced exerciser however must tell you heavy cords definitely take strength work . i hard time biceps move definitely forward shoulder motions . you really hurt yourself if you're not careful so it may good idea workout suggested without cord , learn moves then use cord second time around . i adjusted modified my workout so i use heavy cord moves i know i achieve push myself towards then i use looser cord those forward shoulder motions until i am ready take heavy cords again move . also , they move pretty quickly this dvd if everyone knows how loop cord through quickly . i rewind couple times see what she doing . overall , i said , it solid , effective workout definitely nice break heavy weights leg presses i every other day . so if you're looking something different but still under firm , this good one . i also recommend toning ball dvd aerobic one allison lead . those great too . like i said , i them all , i love results they give	-1
this light takes all guess work out riding dark . i previously relied cateye opticube led ($45 ) which places round spotlight light ahead you somewhere . this fine if streets lights , but not enough when it completely dark . led , you remember what you see ahead you . led , you maneuver light spot around where you need it track corners . led i found myself always concentrating interpet what lay ahead . hid solves these issues bathing entire area light . it lightweight ( good because i lift my bike up stairs ) . little dangly ( red/yellow ) thing switch display . it small red/yellow/green lights inside it indicate battery status you mount this handlebars . hid light detached mount which good when i flip bike over maintenance . i get 1.5 hours full strengh then it switches lower setting 30 minutes . i can't really tell difference high/low settings anyway . charge time 2.5 hours . it first discharges battery keep it happy . manual says you get 300-500 cycles/charges per battery before it down 80% , light lasts 1000 hours . it great light allows me ride faster , safer daydream green lantern without crashing	1

i've using this week now . i'll make 10 points . 1 . i lower back pain ( car accident two years ago ) pretty much constant . it gets worse after any exercising ( running , treadmill , eliptical , etc . ) 2 . i taking ibuprofen years reduce inflammation . 3 . inversion table something i saw thought what heck let try it out . 4 . it great tool pain management - it help relieve pain ( obviously not permanent)5 . i think it working me because it helps decompress my lower discs : specifically l3/l4/l5/s1/s2 i feel less " clicks " during normal business day . 6 . use it 2-3 times day , short periods ( 1-3 minutes really try " let loose " )7 . i exercise not feel sharp pain afterward - my range motion increased8 . i've noticed better posture9 . more range motion10 . my expectations met . this table very comfortable not woobly like other i've heard	1
hello , i just got this rack my mountain bike . first i didn't think i made good decision . but , after i properly secured it bike saw how good it went lines bike , well how sturdy it i knew this rack wasn't going any where ( accept , every where i went my bike ) but my bike good . even though it quick release " qr " system works great . way topeak designed this system great . if you get rack stand alone your bike or get it one topeaks bags ( which i ) you won't disappointed . only thing i think would improve this rack directions . not only rack it self but , i think piece plastic comes rack looks like clip , rear l.e.d. holder . this holder most likely lights like cateye tl-ld1000 . i'm not sure but it sure looks way . i heard people saying they problem rack swaying back fourth while riding but only way i gotten it move if my seat clamp isn't tight enough it would then move my seat ( post ) . but simple fix tightening seat post clamp . bottom line : if you full suspension bike looking good solid rack , look no farther . :	1

i always wanted speed bag , despite not knowing anything boxing . since i live apartments tend move quite bit , i not feel like buying professional one required making holes wall . when i saw this i bought it right away , i chest-high counter seemed made specifically this . it seems work pretty well , but suction not very good . once i managed smash dish when thing simply took off after punch , but rare event . what happens regular basis thing moves while you use it . however , i could received one defective suction cap , so not discouraged . if you avoid putting breakable objects other side speed bag , you should fine . even if it takes off , it not heavy thus it unlilkely much damage . would buy it again despite this defect ..	-1

i don't play golf , but didn't stop me picking this umbrella up , i sick tired cheap 99 cent store umbrellas would break so easily . this umbrella indeed huge , but since i carry laptop backpack me almost everywhere i go , i wanted something would keep it dry during rain , even though backpack water resistant . i've outside rainstorms this it just laughs rain wind . i see other people umbrellas buckle under storm gusts , even flipping inside out , yet this thing , its amazing flap system , stays intact , i just hear wind rustle through flaps . my only complaints handle isn't comfortable it could , since it 62-inch umbrella , it very tall , can't fit backpack like mini-umbrella . otherwise , i love this thing , its lifetime warranty , i should've bought this sooner . well worth extra upfront cost save long-run , i won't smashing any umbrellas against side highway overpass rain after it keeps inverting due high winds . ( yes , this happened me , yes , drivers started looking me strangely	1
this umbrella really lives up its name ... gust buster !!! i bought black one skymall.com ( around $40 ) couple years ago used it while i down caribbean going school . strong winds down there would invert most other umbrellas but this one wasn't even phased wind . flap system they this thing genius ... all umbrellas should . hope this review helps , chrisupdate : get same gust busting effect much cheaper wal-mart	1

i just received my bodylastics maximun tension set absolutely love it !! first , you should know reading this page item ships bodylastics warehouse . it took just 2 days get it me their warehouse after i placed my order , superfast shipping . after opening it up , i immediately put it test . my problem area my shoulder , specifically my left , i hard time working it our properly dumbbells . bodylastics tubes gave incredible tension allowed me comfortably work my shoulder out . after few sets , my shoulder healthy burn like i just my sets cable machine . i then put it through every conceivalbe test i could think . legs .. abs .. biceps .. triceps ,... everything given thorough work out . i want make special mention door anchor not so much put mark door ; i using it hollow in-door door not solid outside door . tubes allowed me perform each exercise slowly deliberately , while focusing muscle i trying work without worry dropping free weight my foot . maximum tension set produce up 150lbs tension if you use all tubes once use only one handle ; plenty me . i would definetly recommend this purchase whole range people ; everyone complete beginer up most expereinced weight lifter . i would especially recommend people physical therapy or anyone recovering injury consult their therapist or doctor consider this product use during their therapy workouts because exercises using this set require slow , deliberate , smooth movements without hazard posed free-weights	1

i got my first vector three years ago , rei . yes , it large . not problem me i am large . i am my third vector ; first two , some strange reason , leaked water , first during incredible monsoon rainstorm mountains arizona , second while taking shower . no , i not submerse watch , nor push any buttons while water ' ' . fortunately , rei accepts returns no questions . it testament how nice this watch i continued replace watch . perhaps i models bad production run , my present vector lasted over two years nary leak . good : i found digital compass very accurate useful . remember it must calibrated time time , don't forget declination . barometer very useful . barometer function constantly operating , accounts nice little symbol upper left display showing pressure trends over past few hours . this very useful if you understand barometric pressure trends their likely results . if you not , look it up learn , you find it very useful if you spend lot time brush . remember barometric pressure must calibrated against absolute sea-level readings time time , especially during rapidly changing weather conditions . once you understand relationship altitude/changing weather , you master complexities both barometer altimeter , understand just how simple they , how reliable this device really . i checked it against my high-end gps other barometers many times , it very accurate indeed . temp useful if you need know temperature ; like all such devices , it taken off your body ten minutes before you get accurate reading . bad : lens plastic . if you any experience fine coated-glass , you fine this : not , ever , wipe any dust or dirt off face . use lens-pen , fine blower-brush . or wait until you've stepped under water it . put simply , it my experience if you keep your grubby paws off it , don't try ' clean ' it your cotton t-shirt/flannel shirt/etc , instead use methods used fine coated glass elements , it look like new forever . mine , it desert dust swamp mud . battery , fact , eventually lose energy ! normal use , you expect year or more battery . if you one those fellas shows everyone he meets his " neat digital compass " , or actually rely this your primary compass brush , it won't last nearly so long . digital compass primary energy-sucker , likely much backlight . use compass only when needed ( you should base-plate compass anyway ... suunto also makes some best these well ) . review stating watchbands give out , i find remarkable i never problem mine , i wear it constantly , day day out . all all , spite fact i return my first two , i heartily recommend vector . tough useful	1
this may ' outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it big , it ugly , but functions make fattest swiss army knife sit corner sobbing jealousy . overall , i like it but there couple things sound better than they . timepiece : outstanding . it hh : mm :ss dd: mmm , course , year setting avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying modern digital watch . stopwatch lap function ( not i ever use lap function , but i'm sure someone interested ) . countdown timer run up 24 hour countdown ( very easy set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos alarms , this one loudest watch alarms i've heard , i've missed too many watch alarms not appreciate this . altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind neat . over four days , my bedroom went 100m above sea level 25 below sea level ( maps , 40m asl ) . not surprising because it driven barometer , i never recalibrated it , but graphic demonstration importance calibrating it when you want/need i t.t he barometer : yup , it barometer . part i like little display shows rising/falling trend , especially this always active ( even normal ' time ' mode ) . thermometer : take watch off get accurate reading sensor too close wris t.t he compass : easily best ' special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough orienteering , not surveying ) , easy use . it programmed declination , but knowing me , i'd forget reset it , so i declination hard way . sighting notches small but servicable . spirit level bubble unique among digital watch compasses suunto , greatly enhances accuracy confidence compass . outstanding wrist compass . package : big . really , really big . but controls very easy use seem fairly resistant accidental button pressing ( problem me other watches ) . battery shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but hatch , so you don't need take it jeweller get it replaced without ruining water resistance . display large characters high contrast back ground , display light just right , readible , even , glare free , but not emergency flashlight . personally , i'm going swap resin band velcro strap , but stock strap isn't bad , just not great . overall , not watch office or suit but very good watch , compass barometer , what you could expect thermometer altimeter . well designed , thought-out , manufactured , but really big .	-1

although cathe friedrich well-known her more challenging , advanced workouts , " stretch max " equally suited both beginners advanced , very easy follow . divided into three roughly 20-minute stretch sessions , workouts either combined , divided seperate days after cardio or strength training session , or ' rest ' days . first part uses only mat , while second part uses stability ball , third uses resistance band . third session probably my favorite because using resistance band further helps achieving range-of-motion increasing flexibility . workout itself fluid seemless interweaving athletic stretches basic yoga poses , which allow exerciser modify according their own range-of-motion level flexibility . music also wonderfully compliments workout , which mostly mix new age , neo-classical light ' chill ' . i also thought pastel pink-and-brown outfits cathe other girls wearing so cute feminine - now i need find me one ! while frequent thorough stretching often overlooked , it essential part fitness which aids muscles faster recovery , helps protect injury maintaining youthful body .

i am knife collector , even bought several sharpening systems . this best . drawing blade proper angle across sharpening surface first important thing . spyderco makes easy because holder sets stones proper angle all you hold blade vertical draw it down across two sides . once you realize how easy getting edge you learn feel edge your finger tell which side edge minute burre overhang . then one gentle draw down side straighten burre you blade really sharp . cheaper steel knives not hold their edge long better ones . this sharpener it so easy even your cheaper knives almost useful , say kitchen because it so easy resharpen . this sharpener make you expert if you give it little practice . i even under sharpen some knives because they hold their edge better when it little thicker rather than " razor sharp " which thinner edge . thorough instructions explain how sharpen many different edges too like bread knives ( serrated ) , scissors , japanese blades ( one sided ) , fish hooks , etc .	1
all my knives used various levels " dull . " hopelessly dull knives left sitting drawer . after doing little bit research , i decided give spyderco shot . i'm very satisfied results . i am not trying compare my knife sharpening skills professionals results , but i say my knives much sharper cut very well now . dvd instructions very helpful got me up speed quickly . spyderco easy use it sets up quickly . i no longer excuse dull knife .	1

this light expensive even when bought discount but worth it opportunity it provides ride ( relatively ) safely night . i also use it working beneath my cars although it much better suited bike . i no problems whatsoever light so far . i initially thought i defective battery but not case . you need carefully follow instructions charging you may unplug charger plug it back occasionally .	1
ha . this most disgraceful weapon i yet encounter . sure mock suppressor sight laser good features , but gun weak , magazine holds meager 10 bbs . i very high standards , this gun met none them . it broke within 3 weeks purchase . but , it pretty good backyard gun , but it nothing compared pro-level airsoft pistols . should not used side arm pro-level airsoft battles ... good backyard fights though	-1
although i don't own this specific hoop , i owned lifetime hoop just like this one over ten years there nothing rusting or breaking off . only thing i replace net . even though it not biggest hoop breakaway rim , it would last much longer withstand decades use . if you're looking economic hoop beginner basketball player buy this hoop	1

yoga mats come three basic thicknesses . 1/8 " this mat average thickness . 24 " 68 " it also standard width length . mats half thick this one good travel or placing under thicker mat provide more traction . thick mats ( 3/16 " ) 50% thicker than this one designed those who need or want extra cushion . there two sides this nearly all yoga mats . look carefully ' bumps ' each side mat . larger bumps designed face upwards cushion your hands , feet , knees during poses while keeping your body dangerously slipping out alignment . smaller bumps designed face downwards grip floor keep yoga mat sliding . many mats label one end name brand . this typically , but not always , located ' up ' side . bumps tell you sure . this yoga mat increase softness stickiness use . ( so most mats . ) they start out mildly sticky increase stickiness more they used . you want wash your mat when it first arrives so remove thin film they get their surface during manufacturing process . instructions washing mat included . once you've washed dried your mat you're ready begin ! after using it while , if you find mat decreasing stickiness each time you pull it out , this typical sign light coating dust or too much body sweat accumulated your mat it needs light hand washing very diluted soap water . after washing , roll your mat thick towel squeeze out excess water , otherwise it take forever dry air . then , air dry your mat unrolled , inside , away sunlight . ( hanging over shower bar works nicely . ) when you first unroll your mat you find one end bit curled . simply alternate direction you roll your mat ( top outside once , then bottom outside next ) or end you start ( curled end once , flat end next time ) you'll find it straightening out more or less over time . i recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them you . i've worked many studios gyms over years . sometimes management mats cleaned often , sometimes not . if you bring your own mat you always know where it . :o ) plus , owning your own mat may encourage you begin valuable practice home . my students who trouble their knees some poses requiring body weight rest knee , i recommend temporarily folding over one end mat get double cushion under knee while still leaving one layer under rest body . this saves you haul more than one mat out each time you practice which discouraging especially beginner .	1
i gotta tell ya , i little hesitant buying bike trainer . would i actualy use it or would it end up closet ? would it too loud like everyone saying ? well , i threw caution wind bought it ... it didn't hurt it under 100 bucks too ! i received bike trainer four days , it out box assembled 8 minutes working up sweat 15 minutes later . i love this thing !! reviews correct , if you've got mountain bike knobby tread tires , it loud ! i my ipod maxed out could still hear tire spinning . i determined though . i put street tire it like whole different machine - quiet smooth ... what workout ! this trainer awesome . money well spent	1
this thing pretty inexpensive what i got . it easy put together every piece included ! " wow ! " , i thought when i saw they didn't forget couple screws or bolts . this often happens me when i buy things i need put together . anyways , after doing everything i could this thing past couple weeks it still completely intact . it doesn't mind when i pull-ups , chin-ups , leg lifts , push-ups or when i hold onto bottom legs when i leg lifts floor . it move slightly when i dips but it not going anywhere . i weigh 155 lbs ., so this thing take some weight . i think limit 250 lbs . other than product tip-top i want mention amazon shipping . i ordered this early april , around 3rd if i remember correctly . i supposed get it tomorrow , 16th . i got it two days after i ordered it ! my dog started barking i thinking , " what wrong her ? " . last thing i expected see when i looked out window my ironman power tower . thanks amazon , ruling	1
power tower pretty straight forward piece equipment . there so many variations activities you it it fairly easy keep it interesting challenging . it pretty light weight piece , i move it around my own ease . i am also over 220 though unit flex when i use pull-up bar , it only so ever so slightly after initial experience checking unit out , it obvious maker designed it this way . bracing strategically placed allow this instead using much heavier materials . i appreciate this concept since it allows me move unit when necessary still gives me complete confidence integrity piece . just check your bolts periodically , any piece fitness equipment . push-up handles only drawback this sole reason i give it 4 instead 5 stars . only usable position me bend where there no padding . this places you fairly extreme angle although it still functional position , it obvious these not well thought out . any attempt even remotely place your hands where padding or any normal position you banging your head lower center brace . separate push-up bars better anyway . check out " perfect push-up " bodyrev here amazon if you're looking . all said , this infinitely usable piece equipment bringing some " big " exercises your home very reasonably sized package . it easy incorporate into your work-out routine even my wife taken liking it . she uses it work out her lower back loves strength/relief it gives her . bottom line , $100 this highly functional piece absolute bargain pretty much no brainer . get it .	-1
whole sword very nice . if your bleach fan you love it . even if you arnt this sword awesome . sheeth this little dot design it though you cant see picture though	1
its good scope , dont buy $6 or $10 scopes , your better off buying this scope . note : if you buying airsoft sniper off this site(amazon) -- none scopes work or attach sniper/rifile you buy accept this one . i highly recommend it	1
this wheel very easy assemble . it important use some type lubricant slide hand grips . first , i tried slide one without it because i afraid lubricant would make hand grips slide around during use after i put it together . hand grip would only go part way i difficulty getting it back off . so , i followed advice reviewer used tiny bit petroleum jelly . hand grips slid right wheel worked grea t.t he wheel very stable works it should . what more could you ask ? this very well-made exercise wheel great price	1
this stuff really good upper abs . first it unbearably hard but time i got used it now it every morning . its cheap easy use anywhere . all you need floor . one more thing , my gf unable more than one because lack upper body strength . other than , its awesome !	1

this great first scooter . non-skid surface makes it hard little ones slip while they scooting , but if they it surely scrape knees it very rough . it very quick easy assemble . it comes some stickers it don't stick very well but still unbeatable value $7.99	-1
bought this amazon our two girls . got it great price free shipping . i don't believe there actually any bearings wheels , but they turn ;) style very cute nice built-in grip . girls got our money worth first day riding it	-1
i've using this water filter system three years now . it light easy use . including setup , i fill 4-5 nalgene bottles 10 minutes or so , without my arms getting fed up repetitive motion pumping . it attaches easily wide-mouth nalgene bottle , so i'd recommend couple those if you don't them already . like any other filter , it gets slower use , so take care it . get silt stopper sure carry replacement filter any extended trip . i found some locations ( isle royale example ) i spent lot more time backwashing silt stopper filter took beating . our camp neighbors even more trouble their filters ( different brand ) , so i didn't feel too bad my minor troubles . replacement filters aren't cheap , but then neither any alternative filters out there . cleaning brush easy use but doesn't seem help much improving flow speed filter slows down . unit responds well cleaned up when you get home stored broken down .	-1
i purchased this wheeled duffle bag gift friend . so i personally cannot review its use . however , i chance look it before wrapping it . this appears quality made . bag defintely heavier than it appears . not point it would difficult use , but rather last longer . bottom bag not collapsible , which would give it more strength carry soda cans . i bought this item sale , i felt i got really good bargain . it well worth money . my friend not given any complaints its use so far	-1
good service , fast perfect condition amazing i love this produc t.t hank you , thank you	1

ahhh , ridicule i get writing few pogo stick reviews ... but these things really fun . i find best pogo stick reviews discussions found xpogo website forum . you'll find comments people who tested all pogo sticks provided honest , critical feedback . so take look recent reviews xpogo before buying any pogo stick . i own flybar 1200 , which i love ( see my review ) . if i market pogo stick , i'd check out vurtego , motostik , power pogo products , among others . xpogo , there long thread flybar 800 , reasonable reviews starting around sept 20 , 2006 . 800 seems great if you under 120-135 lbs . i'm bit over , which means it isn't me , unfortunately . 800 smaller lighter than flybar 1200 , which reportedly makes it more controllable . there problem surgical-tubing-like bands ( " thrusters " ) breaking which may under control . flybar ( sbi ) offers remarkably good customer service , so they likely address any problems you . keep mind pogo sticks changed since old days . new technologies actually kind've interesting . motostik spring , reminiscent master gg sticks old days . it pretty quiet , which might plus . fb 1200 800 use elastomere " thrusters " provide sling-shot like bounce . vurtego power pogo products feel bit like rubber ball bouncing . you adjust them if you inflating ball . so if you want drop big $$ pogo stick , take look what out there . there very , very good chance you'll choose flybar , but aware your options . i think pogo stick renaissance just around corner . , i think it might good kids bounce around these things because all those heel strikes might affect calcium levels actually strengthen bones . there research linking heel strikes calcium levels bone strength . if these results hold up , then pogo sticking child teen may offer lifelong health benefits .	1

i lift 3 times week . this my second pair harbinger gloves . last pair i lasted me 5 years so i sold harbinger quality . harbinger also fits me better than some gloves . basically , i don't fat hands , but i fairly long fingers . addition fit quality , i looking additional finger protection wrist wrap protection , which these glove . gloves washable leather . i not washed this pair yet , but my previous pair washed several times no ill effects gloves or other items laundry . everything these gloves great . i especially like extended finger coverage , which goes past lowest knuckle me up midpoint before next knuckle . i used tape there but no longer . only minor downside big grip feature , which imbedded rubber pads palm fingers . rubber takes few sessions break , so meantime , it not very flexible . it most noticeable curls , where additional bulk rubber prevented me closing my fist much around bar . one rubber pads also digging into my finger few sessions , but i adjusted my grip since subsided . if this big issue , then i would recommend going gel padded harbinger gloves rather than rubber padded ones . i would definitely buy these again , definitely some loyalty harbinger gloves	1

revised 22 feb 2007 . i looking high-end machete when i ran across this little sword united cutlery ( uc ) cabela catalog , where it sold " slimline machete , " not " ninja sword . " it ground single piece 420 j2 stainless steel nylon cord wrapped around hilt . this choice steel questionable any blade over 12 inches . if it heat treated hardness adequate edge retention , it tends brittle , resulting chipping edge or even catastrophic failure . if it not heat treated , it tends too soft really hold sharp edge . still , i heard this piece put hard use never heard one breaking . it may it just short enough get away using 420 stainless . i suppose it all hea t-t reat , without rockwell testing , followed torture testing , i'll never know what this thing can't . it reasonably sharp out box tuned up few swipes carbide sharpener . tang stamp says " hand made , " finish very good . i've heard complaints loose handle wraps , but i haven't problem despite handling sword quite bit . but it machete or " ninja sword ? " well , it sure isn't machete . it really resemble short japanese sword more than anything . rather , it resembles longer version americanized " tanto " -style knives become so popular " tactical " market . granted , i heard people going into woods clearing brush this thing , but i think it would tiring , when it comes swinging sharp metal object , tiring equals dangerous . if you want brush-clearing tool fifty bucks or less , there many choices : ubiquitous ontario meyerco machetes , woodsman pal , crocodile knives no . 227 , various machetes field knives condor , pile inexpensive offerings cold steel , name few . then there dedicated gardening tools like ditch banks weed knives . there no reason clear brush americanized japanese short sword unless you really want . sword , however , it handles nicely . it solid lively hand , nimble thrusting , cutting , chopping . i've made mess many cardboard boxes it . again , i don't know how it would hold up if bashed repeatedly into masonry or body armor , but otherwise , it makes expedient weapon close quarters . so short sword what it . sword clicks positively into included kydex scabbard , which light flat allows several different modes carry . i wish i could find machete this price came such nice sheath . i numerous clubs , axes , knives , swords , sword-like objects around house , some high quality commensurate price , but it this el cheapo sword leans against headboard my bed , it first thing my right hand touch emergency . ( i'd much rather grab paul chen practical wakizashi , but belongs my wife . ) , i suppose , testimony its design execution , which just well suited fighting tight spaces anything out there . grip could fill hand better , those lines , i'm thinking wrapping handle some leather grip tape . remaining question : blade this size , made stainless steel , both hold edge stay one piece ? come spring , i'm taking this thing into woods find out	-1

these cushions recommended me physician , but one medical specialty doesn't involve treating feet or orthopedic problems . this product well designed manufactured , i like support comfort it provides substantially better than four or five different types so-called " orthotic " cushioning/support products ( e.g. , dr. scholl ) i bought over-the-counter pharmacies grocery stores . " gellin '" may fine most folks , but slightly squishy insoles just don't cut mustard , nor ordinary rubbery-plastic inserts . my subjective , anecdotal impression , however , viscospot cushions indeed lessened pain inflammation i otherwise would likely suffered while walking or my feet long periods . anyone this condition knows hard step-down result searing , stumble-inducing pain . these cushions significantly lessen shock , compared either using no device or other cushions/devices i've tried . but these cushions not yet " cured " or substantially improved my plantar faciitis , despite month use now . ( my symptoms date back four months . ) i don't know how these may compare prescription " orthotic " devices custom fitted foot doctors . i've trying cure my problem " cheap , " but i've ended up spending $200 so far various stretching exercise products , various cushions . maybe i should bitten bullet seen specialist doc begin , i dunno .	-1
well , i this nissan bento over 5 years now . adult , i say i no problems it keeping food hot . i find it very comparable , even better than zojirushi mr. bento . i like my food hot , entirely stainless steel , it keeps all 4 containers hotter than mr. bento . top 2 containers mr. bento tend cool ( room temperature ) after 4 hours or more , while nissan , they usually more than warm ( but not steaming ) . make sure i am comparing correctly , i preheat 4 containers hot water before i pack , just like mr. bento . also , construction this bento much more sturdier than mr. bento , which lot plastic . like other reviewer , yes it dent if it gets banged around . adult , i don't any problem it . also mr. bento i got amazon xmas 2006 , made thailand , not japan . apparently it too expensive get it japan now or something like . my girl friend mr. bento made japan , it much sturdier , kept food hotter . i think new mr. bentos plastic lid , which allows heat escape . anyway , i just sold mr. bento ebay , kept lunch bag , which fits nissan thermos really well . i love this nissan thermos lunch tote . it really worth money	1

i my blackburn delphi 6.0 six months put thousands miles tens thousands feet vertical gain . i upgraded older vetta model . since i lot climbing vertical gain percent grade features major attraction me . operations all delphi computers simulated detail excellent interactive program blackburn website . this major selling point . i could " use " computer before i bought it . it eliminated unexpected surprises -- i knew exactly what i getting . ability utilize customer service , if needed , also important me . vdo , example , german company no u.s. offices . they germany customer service telephone number you call , but they only speak german . this might change future , but this case time i made purchase . i am 45 years old . i raced when i college but now ride fitness enjoyment . i don't ride fast but regularly climb 3,000 4,000 feet single ride each weekend . i not looking " performance " computer , rather just something keep track basics important me : speed , vertical gain , distance , % grade . end , i not use some advanced features such laps heart rate . - i found computer relatively easy set up learn . it fairly easy navigate while riding . i won't spend too much time navigation because every one their own like dislikes . go blackburn website navigate interactive program yourself . suffice say , general , i am satisfied operation unit . - wireless transmitter cadence sensor attach zip-ties . i found this unsightly . clamps i used vetta cateye products much nicer . however , i suppose it difficult provide clamp accomodate such large variety tube diameters . but this could accomplished shims it handlebar mounting bracket . however , this not reason not buy this product . i not problem mounting cadence magnet . although it toward end crankarm it not near pedal spindle . every bike different . cadence wire indeed long ( better than too short ) but i just bundled up extra zip-tied it little chainstay brace located tire bottom bracket . - speaking wireless transmitter ... coming wired system i wasn't sure i'd like wireless transmitter , but i . reception computer excellent even though i it right side handlebars transmitter left fork . - altimeter feature great . it why i bought this model . it works measuring barometric pressure resolution 3 feet . however , barometric pressure changes day day so " home " altitude measured computer . calibrating home altitude each time became annoying . but i thought it , i realized i really don't care altitude ... i just wanted know change altitude expressed total vertical gain . so now i just zero vertical gain go ! - vertical gain % grade feature wonderful knowing more road you . i am training century ride almost 10,000 feet climbing grades much 20% . these features help me know if i am training properly . my experience , vertical gain measurement accuracy +/- 5% . occasionally i'll see measurements much +/- 10% .. this definitely within tolerance most electronic instruments i'm sure slight variations barometric pressure start finish your ride contibute difference . my point this device give you very close vertical gain measurement but it won't exact . current technology limitations but it far better than not this measurement all . important point this device measures all vertical gain . there units market not measure gains less than 30 feet . i think bad idea . example , if you riding century rolling topography within each mile there two 25 foot rises ( reasonable scenario ) , there would 5,000 feet unrecorded vertical gain ! i appreciate blackburn unit records all vertical gain . - computer calculates gradient measuring distance traveled altitude gained . necessity , there lag display % grade ( it updated every 5 seconds using data measured over prior 20 seconds ) . this annoying ( but necessary ) because you want know what grade right instant you feel your legs strain . this feature finicky . you find reading fluctuates noticably you climb ( more grade , more fluctuation ) . i speculate this because two reasons : first , roads never rise straight line -- they wavy . second , steeper grade more riders tend not ride straight line . they wiggle off left then right . this affect distance traveled hence affect % grade measurement . main point this device give you good ballpark measurement . don't expect it exact . but again , it far better than not measurement all . small side note , % grade pegs out 20% . there small number riders out there ride roads gradients exceeding 20% it would nice if it could measured . - distance measurement , when programmed correct wheel size , seems accurate within few hundreths mile ( verified gps unit ) . - i not used heart rate moniter , but my wife . it operation straightforward seems work fine . she comfirmed presence " spikes " mentioned earlier review . - computer seems durable . i accidentally dropped it onto garage floor couple times it still works fine . - during one ride i caught rainstorm two hours . toward end ride i noticed display would not respond commands . closer inspection home revealed water gotten into unit . this not surprise rain heavy water once gotten into my old vetta unit ( which eventually dried out recovered ) . although i figured unit would eventually recover , it still unnerving because you can't so sure . owner manual says if this happens contact customer support . i emailed them my story three days ( i wish it more quicky ) i received reply . remedy remove battery cover let it dry out . blackburn wouldn't say whether or not water would ruin computer , but it turns out unit recover only needing new battery . if you ride rain regular basis you might want consider protecting computer water . this story also reinforces need consider customer service when deciding product . while waiting my delphi dry out i consider unit ruined i might buy one . i actually looked other companies their different models again see if i might more satisfied something else . i came conclusion i would buy delphi 6.0 . this greatest compliment i give this product	-1

i truly like this platform . i owned rebok step platform years i thought highly but i gave it friend bought firm fanny lifter ( blue purple one ) save space . while fanny lifter great ( - i still use it leg presses , lunges other strength building exercises ) , it not stable enough step workouts i like . i some cathe friedrich christi taylor workouts you need able some travelling get most out routines . also , it more stable my less than level 100 year old wood floors than my rebok platform . i would recommend investing this platform anyone use it . if you new stepping , perhaps try class few times before spending money or try less expensive , shorter version . i seen it $20-$25 discount chains . personally , i step training 20 years ( i'm 41 ) different impact levels no problems . higher impact i train 6 " level lower impact 8 " . my 9 year old cocker spaniel also uses it get off bed .	1

4x32mm range estimating a.o. full size master sniper scope far best scope you mount airsoft rifle , or even submachine gun . lets face facts , most airsoft guns no purpose scope them , they don't go far or accurate hunting rifle or other rifle . but this mind , this scope best because , airsoft why spend 50 dollars or more scope ? really cheap scopes , they break or don't even fit gun , expensive ones , they same this scope . this scope easy mount easy use . if you never used scope before , dialing it or zeroing come really easy , no tool or anything needed dial , except mounting scope gun , it actually easy mount without tool . scope designed capture light through it , when it pitch dark outside , when you look thought scope , it looks like it beginning get dark outside . there also sun cap allows less sun block your view . all all this perfect scope airsoft . guns i would recommend mounted scope too : 1 ) . utg m40a1 master sniper rifle2 ) . utg ak-47 tactical " warhawk " assault rifle3 ) . utg desert camo and/or olive green m324s sniper rifle4 ) . cqb navy seals utg mp5 a4/a5 submachine gun .	1

i recieved this product 3 weeks ago am impressed how it works . i used above average wrestler highly competitive state iowa , so over years i learned many pushup workout techniques keep body fit strong . i used treat my body hobby , using pushups dumbbells my main source lifting staying shape . over past year , i've put little weight lost some tone just like quite few people once final years school , careers , family consume majority your time . recently , i am looking get back old form . i saw perfect pushup television intrigued equipment . i also little research via internet see what information i could find product . i wondered how doing pushups perfect pushup compared doing pushups normally , wondered whether i could get into shape faster them whether they worked . i tell difference results perfect pushup doing normal , flat floor pushups . so far i am pleased . getting acclimated twisting motion perfect pushup probably hardest part , especially if you used doing pushups flat floor . but , after couple sets twisting motion becomes natural movement . doing pushups perfect pushup tends little difficult first week because twisting movement really targets whole upper body some your abs . i felt little soreness few hours after doing set twenty . first week , fight through soreness realize pushups using perfect pushup little tougher . try going back normal , flat floor pushups you'll amazed how many you . you feel like you 100 before getting burn . i haven't vigorous workout perfect pushup yet because busy schedule , but i try use them 5-10 minutes night . so far , everyone else i see i look thinner more toned . i think i look more toned my chest upper abs so i am excited develop more routine workout lasts 30 45 minutes much like i used wrestler see how fast i see results . i'm so impressed this product i recommend it everyone including friends family . some friends stopped house saw them lying floor . course like lot people they think it workout fad until they try it . i few friends live die weight room . they teased me bit then became pretty impressed once they decided set pushups . burn muscle fatigue comes quicker than most expect meaning perfect pushup works even those accustomed working out regular basis . one thing really impresses me how easy perfect pushup allows you isolate arms chest muscles ease doing one-handed pushups .	1
i little hesitant order arrival after reading some feedback but product arrived time ( after 9 days stated ) quality surpasses my expectations . materials construction very sturdy , right down workout poster , made heavy grade glossed paper , accompanies perfect pushup . perfect pushup itself great . while regular pushups put strain wrists due angle , this product eliminates problem allows your arms rotate naturally , reducing stress muscles forced work unnatural motion . they more difficult than regular pushups because factor stabilization involved allow you extend motion beyond your chest touching floor regular pushups . workout poster pretty basic so if you want more creative workouts beyond narrow , wide , regular pushups pickup available dvd . construction seems able last lifetime . i'm very happy this product	1

give little background how i'm comparing this workout , i following other cathe workouts : power hour , ctx kickbox , rhythmic step , entire intensity series , terminator , kick punch crunch , timesaver , low max , kick max , muscle max low impact circuit . hands down , this my absolute favorite workout . i think what takes cake me music . it not * just * 80 music , either - it remixed techno versions it , since i'm huge fan techno going out clubbing dancing my heart out techno , it small wonder i find this workout so enjoyable . step routines total kick . i'm not sure exactly how recommend this workout far those new cathe workouts goes . i think choreography easy follow , but then i've doing cathe workouts now around four years , so i've lot practice ( i used not able make it through even warmup rhythmic step once upon time ago . ) basically , my recommendation if you can't figure out step routines , just take your time keep trying . i can't comment too much weighted portion this workout - i tend pop this one utilize all cardio segments , including bonus cardio track end my cardio days . i plan this workout occasionally my weights days weekend when i know i dedicate whole hour half workout , i tell you i am wiped out end when i entire thing . best best best cathe workout so far , though ! love it . i hope cathe put together more jewels like this . i think it also helps she definitely very happy mood when she doing any workouts series this dvd came out . her hardcore series , she just doesn't seem quite so happy - more like she worn out , so it puts completely different mood workout . get this dvd ! it fantastic	1

i'm 43 this nothing like weak pogo stick my little brother when i kid . i surprised everyone family ( even myself ) when i ordered it . when it arrived , i discovered i gravity games version , which i think looks better because it isn't red . it fully assembled , too . spring so stiff , i afraid get it first but i took it my little brother house we blast it . you won't catch me doing any extreme tricks my age , but it plenty fun just bounce around try stay bouncing . indoors , i use it exerciser just trying balance it . it quite workout . don't let stiff spring intimidate you , once you start bouncing , you appreciate it . i've already so much fun this pogo stick , it paid itself first day . ( looks people faces when they see grown man bouncing pogo stick make it even more fun . ) it well constructed i expect it last long time . but like i said , i won't doing any extreme tricks it . if you try hard enough , you break just anything . if you get too crazy it or don't pay attention what you doing , you hurt yourself too . i get enough rush just taking it easy	1

cyclists recognize headlights roughly placed into two categories : ( 1 ) " see " lights provide sufficient illumination actually see where you going avoid obstacles , ( 2 ) " see me " lights really only seen front . i commute hid light much brighter than this one , but i like backup light , also like flashing helmet mounted light i point any direction get attention motorists , particularly those approaching me side . princeton tec light one few led lights i've enountered truly qualifies ( albiet , barely ) " see " light . highest setting , it produces very well collimated beam just right intensity width make it suitable night riding reasonable speeds . light less suitable medium setting , unsuitable purpose lowest setting . i same gripes kent this light . ( 1 ) it should designed use aa batteries . if it made use aa batteries instead aaa batteries , light would only marginally larger heavier , but burn time would greatly extended ... enough make it suitable ultra cycling events . ( 2 ) duty cycle " flash " mode too low . light would far more visible if flash rate increased least factor two or three . those complaints aren't knock effectiveness light itself . just suggestions improvments could make great light even better	1

i've bongo board few days now am very happy so far . very solid construction ! one great feature axis roller stays connected board stretchy cord runs length bottom board . this prevents roller dangerously flying off across room if you lose your balance . ( i seen other balance boards where roller not connected this could very dangerous , since it could fly off break something inside your home . ) roller stopped either end board two trucks so it won't roll completely out under you . it very difficult first ! beginners definitely need some chairs or something hang onto , or spotter . my friend who long time skateboarder tried it thought it also pretty tricky balance - it different feeling skateboarding . it comes booklet describing right ' form ' suggested ways use board some tricks learn once you get advanced .	-1

this hard nylon version yawara stick . there used some impressive versions these market , but now there this one two others , one aluminum one wooden , both functional but rather less inspired . more common pocket stick kubotan , which just shorter , skinnier yawara stick , usually configured keyring . kubotans come many shapes materials . don rearic * writes , you think pocket stick knife , but two differences : you thrust , but not cut ; you target bony areas . also , extent poking holes people bad legal hygiene , stick safer than knife . you strike " pommel " yawara hammer blow or " point " reverse hammer blow or even sort rapier thrust , bracing tip thumb . you also use it trap or lock joints , if you know what you're doing . anything you hit even moderately hard going hurt . this thing break bone , pulverize muscle , shock nerves , all without skinning or fracturing your knuckles . yes , product description says it non-lethal , but if you whack someone head it , you could kill him . " just " breaking someone bones no joke , either . before you try it out friend or foe , everyone favor take few whacks piece 3/4 " plywood . this should give you some respect what this tool . unlike many weapons , yawara stick won't extend your striking range . you get up close personal whatever you're hitting , which usually means it hit you . if you're too timid close range , pocket stick probably won't you lot good . this thing like big , indestructible knuckles each end your hand . highly recommended . * please use google more info , amazon doesn't allow offsite hyperlinking .	1

excellent quality ; much easier put than cap i used before	1
i'm my 5th cap now i think . silicone great lasts forever . unlike rubber ( which snag hair ) latex ( which some people allergic ) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair , glossy finish so it looks great doesn't lose elasticity . i some advice if you want try this product i've learned overt years : 1 . always rinse hang dry . i've left wet caps my gym bag after month two neglect , it develops black spots . i don't know if it mold , it doesn't wash off ... you'll buy new cap if you don't like spotted look . 2 . pull it gently . i've ripped one when i trying stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it . it not cloth so you careful . this goes latex rubber , too . 3 . wet your hair first . if your hair dry when you put it , you trap air under cap . since it not permeable material , cap start come off while you swim because air trying escape inside . 4 . pick fun color . that it . great swim	1

i doubt these shoes because friends shaolin who swore these shoes i wanted shoes use capoeira . well , grooves bottom shoes make it very difficult slide your feet backwards or spin ball your foot because insanely large amount friction so it no good me capoeira but obviously they weren't made . there incrdibly large range friction so if you need keep your feet ground these shoes definetly you . also - these shoes insanely comfortable . since i've bought these , i wear them nearly every opportunity i . they're light , padding bottom perfect your feet first time you put them last . stylish . only drawback them would if you any need slide your feet backwards or rotate your feet it may difficult - but , other than its wonderful shoe	-1
i got this week ago . assembly pretty easy , took less than hour . only problem i one pins hold uprights place some stripped threads . i called customer service number they sent me two replacements which i received within week . bench press : bench four positions : flat , decline , two incline . uprights adjustable four different heights . bottom part seat also adjustable flat or two different incline positions . while doing incline bench presses higher two incline positions , it nice put lower part seat up it highest incline position , it holds you place so you don't slide downwards while doing your reps . there also pair extra barbell holders located lower down uprights ; if you can't finish rep , you dump bar there . bar come rest inch above your chin , so you don't lift it very far get it there . that really nice safety feature . overall , it very comfortable works great any sort bench press , incline decline or flat . there nothing gets way , uprights adjustable get bar right height , bench really solid feel it . i use 6 ' standard bar , which works fine . course 7 ' bar would work well . squat rack : you use this bench squat rack . lower bar holds uprights together curved , so you stand them . you just flip bench forward ( it stays straight up position ) . then you raise uprights high they go turn them around backwards so they're facing correct direction . they're tubular , so you just take pins out turn them around . ideally , uprights could go up little higher , you squat down somewhat order get under bar . but , you're doing squats anyway so what point complaining you extra 1/5th rep. besides , it infinitely better than picking weight up off floor . leg attachment : this removable , which nice because it not way when you're not using it . it two different heights , i found lower one best leg curls , upper one better leg extensions . if you try using leg curl attachment upper height , padded bar wants roll up your legs you exercise . lower position , there no problem . padding bars very thick comfortable . leg extensions , bar goes right across front your ankles stays there throughout exercise . same leg curls - once i got it right height , it stays same place your legs throughout exercise , no rolling back forth . bar holds barbell plates 1 " diameter , there adapter sleeve included olympic plates ( 2 " diameter ) . preacher curl bench : this goes same place leg attachment . i originally thought there problem barbell holder which sticks out front this , it wouldn't allow me get full extension bottom movement . but i found if you move forward seat so your legs under preacher bench , middle your biceps even top bench , it works just fine . there no interference barbell holder all . even though barbell holder only few inches wide , bar balances just fine it , it handy feature . overall , i can't find anything complain this bench . after little experimenting around find correct position when using preacher curl bench , which height leg attachment needs leg curl work correctly , everything works fine . bench nice solid , padding seat thick firm . replacement part i needed received quickly , no charge , no questions asked . i'm really happy this purchase .	1
gloves tight , solid feel , made good materials . manufacturer describes new feature , " innovative curved finger design offers natural , flexible comfortable fit " . sounds good , but not add any real comfort glove . you still excess padding when making fist makes it more difficult grab bar . pros : solid feel ; good padding ; good materials , overall design craftsmanship ; " no sweat " wicking system seems work there no dark residue left hands after workout , which not case most manufacturers using cheaper materials . cons : excess inner padding affecting grip ; no " easy-off " feature offered many other manufacturers ; wrist wrap takes some tweaking comfortable	-1

i initially purchased velocity spin bike because its lower price ( $150 less ) , but after few weeks buyer remorse , it back bike shop exchange it schwinn ic elite . this bike offers amazingly smooth stable ride , which well worth extra money . i also appreciate its extra features . i've only use emergency brake twice , but both times i happy it . just check specs other indoor cycles , you'll amazed how many not offer standard emergency breaking feature . when you're spinning 25-40 pound fly wheel , you really need ability make sudden stops event emergency . additional water holder great , because i always drink least 2 while riding , i don't want stop mid-ride reach drink . many indoor cycles offer only one ( if any ) aren't built accommodate add-on holders . i ride using adjustable foot harnesses which comfortable sturdy . i haven't used toe clips this model . it comfortable bike overall , but i question 4'11 " " compatible user size . " i'm 5'3 " could use additional half inch forward adjustment . however , i've found i compensate using handlebar center protrusion when riding neutral position . shorter users should probably give bike in-store test run make sure it won't cause neck , shoulder , arm or back strain . specs also state it compatible users up 6'8 " . my husband 6'8 " he able ride very comfortably without straining his back or knees . saddle okay its own , but i prefer using gel cushion cover added comfort . seat width standard , so it easy find suitable cover . after 3 years use , my schwinn held up perfectly , without needing serviced . it great product . highly recommended	1

i gave up trying find watch both compass thermometer , since none temperature watches seemed work well ( according all reviews ) . i then looked only watches compasses , plus usual set timers alarms stuff . enduro seemed best combination cost value . my first day it , i driving unfamiliar city night poorly marked road compass helped me determine i going right direction . ( soon afterwards , i found route sign . ) i since used it kayaking orient our group , so feature seems work fine . rest features easy use any watch i i doubt i am using them their full advantage . also , it easy read i think it one more stylish this type watch . so ... i feel like i got more than my money worth here . note i watch only one month now , so time ( sorry ) tell . but , so far so good	1

other reviews mark - this great little light . i other lithium powered lights this one may not bright some them , but its so small i no excuse not always carry it . i only one bit personal experience add . i've found if you turn bezel just past where it goes off ( maybe 1/8 turn past ) you operate light one handed just like tactical light - hold front light inside curled finger press back your thumb momentary operation . this may unique my particular unit , so ymmv	1
i believe zippo pocket handwarmer made same japanese company makes " peacock " - hakkin company japan . hole pattern top zippo warmer hole patterm similar chimney zippo lighter . peacock hole pattern shaped like peacock , more elegant . zippo filler flask ok , but one supplied peacock superior . it funnel valve fits fill area unit . when funnel rotated 90 degrees , valve opens fluid inserted no spillage . not so zippo filler flask . bag peacock drawstring closure , where zippo uses velcro . zippo bag big zippo label it , where peacock not more formal ( i prefer simpler style ) . zippo bag black , while peacock bag green ( shows less pocket lint than black)the burners -- both units share same burner - which hakkin offers individually . however zippo burner stamped " zippo " base unit huge " zippo " . quality peacock zippo superior jon-e . similar price units , get peacock . zippo close second due cosmetics accessories . also , any brand lighter fuel used ( you don't use zippo fuel )	-1
compared other " similar " warmers i used past , this device shows typical zippo quality attention detail . easy fill , using included measuring device half- or full-day warmth . easy light , color-change heat detector cap verify ignition . , just advertised , produces abundant warmth hours . no leaks , no problems , just heat . my wife loves it her hands even tucks it into small her back when she extra chilly . highly recommended	1
there aren't many exercise routines i without getting bored or hurt ( bad knees ) but rowing reasonably low impact but great all-around . this machine great value given its variable levels magnetic-assist resistance top basic air resistance . it folds up nicely when you need floor space , runs smooth , isn't too noisy . best all , it got this lazy-bones back exercising regularly , after one month , i already feel difference	1
i found this product good solution what i needed it -- carry my families ski up slopes . there not lot noise wind aerodynamic issues , even high speeds . it holds skis firmly place , very easy use open button close snap . although it may not made metal , it sturdy enough nothing moves i t.t his far better option several other systems i found , which offered too many parts not whole lot value price they wanted . factory installed ski rack which would cost $300 roughly same size not good deal this rack my 2000 dodge durango . response previous two reviews , i must note few corrections . firstly , rack hold two snowboards , i tested it two my friends snowboards my last trip . order them fit , one must face down other face up , one top other . individual who posted it not obviously didn't think try stacking them . second , response fact bar could simply twisted--you're joking right ? it would attract attention if individual attempted twist off bar . top , order them twist off bar , they would break board/skis rack process , would defeat purpose , would it not ? only problem i this fm1 adapter which required install this carrier my factory bars . instructions assembly didn't provide any information any vehicles besides imports . ( domestic cars out luck since this sweden based company !	-1

i finally caved bought transfirmer system 4 videos plus i bought jiggle free buns arms go it . i doing this program three weeks say i feel firmer indeed . i don't follow meal plan they suggest either almost lost one dress size my clothes fitting better . transfirmer system basically step system . if you step workouts past then you no difficulty becoming acclimated system . however , since this much higher step , you experience more muscle burn ( especially if adding weights ) . interlocking two " steps " keeps transfirmer sliding around during lunges - like my old step . someone else mentioned , this very sturdy piece equipment i impressed quality it . you use it any step workou t.t he videos concentrate getting job borderline boring times . instructors don't offer perky motivational conversation or explanations how muscles targeted like kathy smith denise austin . this may plus though , because after repetitive use , kind chatty conversation become annoying . exercises heavy lunges squats without weights . they also offer modifications use until you build up your maximum level . these workouts refreshing because they mix match low-impact floorwork step training weight lifting . so you never get jittery feeling after jumping up down 45 minutes like other step workouts . one more plus these workouts not take alot space . i gave this sytem five stars because i think it offers great approach longterm fitness diet	1
i'm lover firm videos reason : they best out there . this series no exception . moves good , music great . only reason i didn't give this five stars because new transfirmer large somewhat difficult move into new positions . said , it no means reason not buy system . new box allows new moves stretch tone parts other boxes weren't able get . overall , it good purchase	-1

this machine more strider than elliptical . its advantage over tony little machine smaller footprint . nonetheless , it beats sitting front television . no variable resistance available . heart rate measured grips . exercise cannot performed without holding onto grips . readout gives calories , cadence speed . machine very quiet sturdy if you fit weight limit ( 200 lbs or less ) . i would not go higher this may wobble . it big advantage it folds easily fits under bed save space , unless you need clothes rack . not exactly advanced athelete but beginner or intermediate fitness fan . this more than fit bill . pros : pricequietstorablecons : lack resistancenot true ' elliptical motion'not advanced fitness afficianado or triathelet	-1

my opinion , this top quality solid bristle board seems true normal wear under our cricket matches . any dart player knows bull eye target all dart boards prone wear down first expose ring metal rendering board useless because bounce outs or dropouts . if i may add , if such company design dart board synthedic polymer or sometype small bullseye which gets hammered more than any other area board , concept might rectify problem premature wear any bristle dart board it regulation or amatuer . albeit , i like this board any dozen quality made dartboards i purchased past	-1
my wife i owned smooth ( keys fitness ) 5.15 treadmill over 2 years . we not owned treadmill , but before committing this one , we tested many other brands this price range . smooth brand definitely smoothest ride you get without paying significantly more . each us runs 2-5 miles daily , when maintained prescribed owners ' manual ( occasional lubrication belt realignment ) , 5.15 handles it easily . ride very comfortable , compared other treadmills running outdoors ) , we no doubt this treadmill would handle more vigorous running ease . we few problems 5.15 . within first year , some sof t-t ouch buttons control panel stopped working , circuit board replaced twice . this involved working 25 screws each time . then , year later , arm-mounted toggle switches stopped working . these small auxilliary switches incline speed levels , so they weren't vital . they easy replace without tools . then , two years , belt tore slightly seam , one edge . treadmill still usable , but loose piece belt smacked against plastic housing loudly each revolution . this wasn't terribly difficult replace , but it certainly wasn't fun , requiring disassembly entire platform . service notes : outside ' parts labor ' warranty period , when only parts covered , customers pay shipping parts keys fitness . most keys ' service technicians knowledgeable , perfectly willing guide you through long repair process , providing frank helpful advice way . today , 5.15 still works it when it new , over two years ago . nothing else diminished , nothing else shown wear . when things gone wrong , keys provided us good customer service . overall , we're happy our experience , we'll probably buy smooth treadmill next time .	-1

this boxing set good value compared if i would bought each item separately . however , you only really need boxing bag , gloves spinning thing attach it ceiling . other piece equipment you mount wall very large not really useful us . maybe it would someone else , but you just use spinning thing mount it beam use boxing bag way . other mounting wall bracket heavy takes up too much room . but i bought this whole set anyway because it cheaper buy all this together than buy it separately .. it good exercise !	-1

hi ! i just posted review same product ( but shipped amazon ) , i thought i'd copy review here your convenience . quick note though : one sold amazon free shipping so definitely take look . why i bought iti like workout 4-5 days week , but i live la it sometimes hard get gym if i work late or if there traffic . also , my neighborhood not so nice , so i prefer avoid jogging night . enter fitness quest integrity 3000 air rower . assemblyif you assemble ikea furniture or coffee table walmart , then you assemble rower . you put 4 pins , then hook strap rower bungie cord under seat . finito . far tools go ( despite what instructions say ) all you need two wrenches . use socket wrench ( $10 target or walmart ) you'll even faster . qualitythe rower surprisingly good quality price . it made two piece aluminum frame feels sturdy . first , i little skeptical chain connecting rower handle , because it looks really small cheap-o . but , after 30 minutes hard rowing , i could tell chain more than adequate . one reviewer target website said chain exploded into million pieces while she rowing . maybe she faulty chain ; who knows . all i know i row 150 pounds weight stack gym , but there no way i could shatter chain simply rowing . stress test , i even rowed hard i possibly could , rower fine . performancethe performance this thing really great . resistance level smoothness good cardio rower i use gym . this air rower , so resistance increases harder you pull . additionally , you increase resistance wrapping tension strap around its base one time before connecting it cord under seat . seat slides very easily , foot pads swivel allow your ankles little more freedom move . also , rower folds vertically easy storage . when it folded , rower 4 feet tall takes up 2 square feet floor space . it easily fits closet or corner . although , it too wide fit under bed . valuegreat value . my buddy rower costs twice much , difference hardly noticeable . performance great , if you buy amazon item you get it tax-free free super saver shipping . i looked couple other rowers ( mainly piston rowers ) nothing even came close this level quality performance price . issuesthe only negative thing i say it little noisy ; even air rower . ( those you who never used air rower , resistance created big fan which makes " whoosh , whoosh " sound when you row . ) noise isn't terrible , but it prevents you hearing tv or radio clearly ... even ear phones . summaryso all all , i think this fantastic value . quality great , performance fantastic . i highly recommend this product .	1

i am so happy my table . while i normally don't like upside down , i love feeling stretching my spine while i hang downwards . i not achieved 90 degree setting yet but i am confident i so . i use table first thing morning stretch after sleeping it makes me stand up , after i get off , like i ballet workout ; stomach relaxed , shoulders down , chest out relaxed . five minutes literally feels like i hour nap , so i this when i come home or lunchtime ( before eating ) if i am working home . i don't it after i eat . i never it full stomach , right after eating . i intermittent traction most time . when i get up full inversion 90 degrees , i plan try some those crunches , which said equivalent 10 regular crunches . warranty information teeter hang ups home-use inversion products backed full 5-year warranty . during period starting day retail purchase continuing 5 years , stl international , inc . extends original consumer purchaser warranty against defects materials , workmanship , fabrics , padding . note commercial use home equipment voids all warranties . teeter hang ups commercial line backed full 2-year warranty	1

people apparently not following ( or misunderstanding ) basic instructions , leading them believe pump doesn't work . here what it says box my similar airstrike 950 came in:' pump lever up position , tighten screw cap ensure proper seal . ' screw cap knobby appendage surrounding stem connector . pump lever opposite side , up position means move it away pump body . you must first move lever up then tighten screw cap order pump work . sure tighten it all way , until you encounter strong resistance . tightening cap applies pressure rubber sleeve inside , which causes it bulge inward form good fit around valve stem . if you make rubber sleeve too tight it won't fit over valve stem , only then should you loosen cap slightly until it fit . ' lock lever down position . ' pushing lever down applies final bit pressure rubber sleeve inside , creating airtight fit around valve stem . when you screw cap properly adjusted , lever offer some resistance you push it down , then it lock place against body . that it . now you use pump . when you're , flip lever away body remove pump . now we're over hurdle , good news pump it amazingly small light , it works great inflating sports balls , which main thing i bought it . only issue i've found it pretty hard generate high pressure pump . i'm reasonably strong , but am unable inflate bicycle racing tires their proper level using this . spite , i'm giving pump five stars here offset all those ratings people who just didn't use it correctly	1

received my door gym yesterday , it put all together 5 minutes , i up hanging . also worked great pushups . such poor directions , it took couple minutes figure out what bolts should go where , but once i , it cinch . those problems assembly , or considering purchasing door gym , here deal . hex head bolts installed vertically , where 90 degree bend tubes connect horizontal bar . use silver washers these . rounded bolt heads ones used attach plastic bar two 90 degree bend tubes together back , installed horizontally . use smaller black washers these . looking underneath rounded bolt head , you see it four-sided short length , not round . now , looking plastic bar pad , if you look holes where bolts go , you see they square opening . square part bolt pushed into square opening . if it not , you won't length necessary securely screw cap nut . this why several people issues it . great product , would even better if it easily understood , complete directions .	-1
after reading reviews , i wondered if i'd able assemble this product . it hard certain when half reviews say " completely worthless " , other half say " awesome product . " after speedy delivery karate depot , i satisfied . it took less than 10 minutes put together . screws , some reason , just barely long enough fit . there only two pairs screws , so if you try using wrong pair wrong holes , you're not going get anywhere ; included washers , there just barely enough room bolts . this not helped almost humorously poor instructions . perhaps these factors caused other reviewers disappointed ; or perhaps screws mispackaged their boxes actually too short . my case , i've product two months , around 75 pull-ups week , no problems whatsoever . once put together , product works great doors meet its specifications ( you see specs online , so check before you buy ! most standard doors work ) . i definitely recommend old sock or other added cushioning ; there not damage wall above door , but there occasional black streaks . these streaks removed easily cleaning product such magic eraser , so i'll accept them over other pull-up bars require drilling into door frame . i highly recommend this product . trust me , this thing put together used without coming down your head . i think pull-ups great exercise , i know no easier way them comfort your home .	1

this inexpensive machine when you get it you see why . still probably worth money if you actually use it while watching tv . people who essentially want machine show up weight come off might hate it might those who think feeling burn only way go but i think its best way burn 400 calories while watching single tv show without killing your back . you sustain zero resistance level twist hour straight break light sweat , lo level cardio . rate ( tummy toning cardio machine - which it excellent !!! ) you burn 7 9 calories per minute . i know this because i also own body bugg calorie management armband measured calories burned one hour work out . i loved it because its great way avoid just sitting there when you want watch tv . i've killed myself brutal kick boxing workout same calorie burn shorter time - this less stress back . i thought video demonstration i recommend only using it once see different exercises . workout video i give it negative 3 out 10 . absolutely best thing this isn't hard workout but it burn long term ( 45 minute hour ) calories . because i think its sustainable motivation- people who hate their workout machine not use them they end up garage . this my new tv chair	-1

pros : high pressure , very small , light weight , high qualitycons : heating , flimsy rubber holder frame connectorthis amazing pump , very small works really good . i other pumps before , but my racing bike i need put over 100psi air . no mini pump could go near 80psi . this one goes much 160psi according specs . when i tried it my bike , i could go over 100 easily . my tires take maximum 120psi , so i didn't try further . it neatly built , high quality material . barrel brushed aluminum , very narrow diameter . towards end pumping it gets warm , but it works like charm . thanks topeak ! if i lose i'd definitely buy again	1

this thing works . i won't make lot crazy claims , but i say this great starter device get your abdominal muscles working properly . my wife bought it i afraid it going typical tv gimmick . now i use it more than she . it seems tighten up strengthen whole range abdominals ( some parts back shoulders ) , making you more slender across midsection giving you strength gut-busting exercises if you want those crunches you feel you cannot right now . someone else pointed out , this really benefit if you already cardiovascular or fat-burning exercises but need trim concentrated areas . exercises like this don't remove fat ( cardio , etc ., -- consider doing them heart monitor guarantee consistent effort . ) they firm up muscles those areas instead hanging loosely looking flabby . what not ? ( i know this experience ) don't crunches weight . i built nice strong round belly way once ( thanks wrong advice , bally's!) if you made mistake , i hate say it , but you'll probably lay off abdominal exercises long time , then use this , add torso twisters ( very low weight ) lower back extensions , crunches ( without weight ) knee raises . you find ab slide torso twisters build your strength so you other exercises -- total maybe 10-15 minutes day . any exercise , take it easy first . don't extend all way until you've using it while . once you've using it week or so , you'll get feel how far you extend	1

first , interest full disclosure , i am writing this review under my husband " real name " because it his account . my husband i avid readers we often read bed before falling asleep . such , we've looked tried just every book light market . we initially found these lights chance costco , sitting themselves ( only package available ) top stack books . we tried them out they fantastic . most book lights one two features we liked , lot more we didn't . these just what we wanted . they lightweigh t.t hey very , very brigh t.t he battery easy change . light bulbs never needed replaced . they compact don't weigh down paperback . clip strong stays place . best all swivel . you direct these lights anywhere you need them , left/right , up/down , all around . plus you direct arm holds lights various angles . it perfect nigh t-t ime or car/air travel reading . someone said it hard find batteries lights . we've never problem . target walmart carry extensive supply ( i think they 2032 , we get duracell energizer brands they last long time ) . very easy replace , just unscrew back light pop them . i say first lights we got original two-pack costco ( we never seen them store again , it such fluke ) problem one two lights . one batteries always gets stuck next impossible remove . we end up unscrewing other half light where bulbs pushing battery out other side . this obviously not intended way change battery . however this never happened lights we've bought this company through amazon - only one one first two we got costco , i'm not even sure they made same people , although they look identical . since buying first two-pack , we've bought four more lights this company amazon . my husband i keep them various locations house , our travel bags , car , etc ., get constant use out them . they durable , long lasting . only one thing i complaint : claw-clip supposed open using thumb-press movement , but i find it difficult use . it easily worked around just opening it my fingers attaching it book . maybe i small hands , my husband doesn't this problem . it minor issue , though . finally , i love colors . pink , blue , purple especially . they just make you happy look , but maybe that just me . :	1
simple concept : hinged 5 iron club bends errors your swing . it require person comfortable enough actually hit 5 iron - which many high handicap golfers struggle hit well . those people who use hybrid 5 irons or greater , or defer 7 9 woods , this aid not you . if you developed your fundamentals " grooved your swing " through thousands balls numerous lessons , you not benefit . value club it used hit ball - note momentus cannot used hit ball . key difference here gives this training aid greater versatility . original takeaway , if you're not correct position , club break . every aspect your swing , if there flaw it found . most part , i found my faults initial takeaway when trying rush shot . i need it remind me get me back tempo when range . it excellent tool someone conventional golf swing either ' one plane ' or ' two plane ' method ( outlined jim hardy ) . regarding natural golf method , i cannot verify its benefi t.t his club reveal your faults immediately . i wouldn't recommend it novice without any experience or formal instruction or even beginner who hasn't consistency groove swing . it person who more consistent swing - one who isn't struggling get ball air or getting ' wormburners ' . just one week working this club , i found some fundamental faults plagued me . after few weeks , i developed confidence irons . obviously golfer swing composite various facets grip , alignment , stance , tempo , takeaway , backswing , transition , downswing , contact follow-through . if you find one aspect your swing fault , there likely domino effect require some other changes your technique . this tool not any way obviate solid practice or lesson golf professional - it complement it depending upon your style . club head small compared oversized game improvement clubs thin topline it profile muscleback more than cavity back iron . thus its sweetspot smaller than modern iron ' duffer ' like me ( i use ben hogan apex edge irons wider sole thicker topline ) . if you hit it correctly , it sail its intended target . i don't typically hit 5 iron very far but it goes 150-160 yards me . i highly recommend this club . it worthy consideration it excellent tool maintain proper swing plane tempo . no other device help tell you multitude flaws your swing may possess . it no wonder training aids come gone but this one still met test time . -i also reviewed medicus driver	1

great skateboard money . got this my " angel " christmas he seems love it . appeared sturdy good quality like any other skateboard	1
novice intermediate , this excellent set lifting straps . you don't need something like this beginning . but weight you're handling starts exceed your grip strength , this invaluable . use simple . you just wrap strap around bar . there no real technique it . you lift weight , weight itself pull strap tight transfer some load straps around your wrists . i don't recommend wrapping straps too tight , transfer almost all weight your wrists your forearms won't get usual amount workout . point complete lift without your grip failing , not avoiding using your grip altogether . if you it right , your grip supporting most weight beginning , you complete more reps your grips start fail , more more weight transfered straps . this simple , no frills strap . it works it priced very reasonably . padding little light , but it adequate unless you handling some herculean weight	1
other than not really knowing how size snorkel gear , 2 people , andi wasn't really interested paying dive shop prices . i also leaving mayan peninsula 7 days . i went shopping line . i didn't want rent gear , or use gear resor t.t he only issue i didn't/couldn't properly size gear . mask not fit my face or my girlfriends face well . we different shaped faces/headsbefore we go again , we spend money dive shop new masks . delivery came well before we left mexico . not deal all plastic packaging marketing garbage would normally come this class gear , wonderful . i think masks may work well kids .	-1

like chive , this knife nice small package that deceptively stabby . sure , it looks innocent , but how much blade you want your eye ? hypothetically speaking , course . i would never indicate you should stab people this knife . never ever . high points sleek design , flawless assisted opening , light weight . i problems thumb studs assisted opening knives , so i am very pleased this index opening . safety-conscious , there safety lock keep blade opening your pants . not it , but just case i guess . leek perfect knife people small hands ; i assisted opening definite bonus . too many assisted opening knives too bulky my hand , or too powerful when it snaps open ( kershaw tactical blur , example ) . leek firmly snaps into place without " recoil " light small enough people small hands easily use . but don't fooled its innocent appearance . this knife deadly little package should not underestimated	1
i'm not huge outdoorsman but wanted nice everyday pocket knife . kershaw leek fits bill . i love size , long enough get your whole hand envolved task yet small enough clipped your pocket forget its there . i planning taking clip off just letting knife " float " my pocket but fell love clip . only thing better than light weight your pocket no weight your pocket . i find knife well designed i really like speed safe opening action . it solid " click " lets you know knife locked position . super sharp perfect drop point blade .	1

we bought this month ago . it went together easily enough - took 1.5 2 hours - instructions clear . it very quiet ! i love ! resistance plenty us - we aren't workoutaholics don't overuse our equipment . if you serious biker want something stay shape , i would go one more expensive models . if you like us , work out 3-5 times week 30-45 minutes , then this perfect you . it adjusts plenty tall person . someone 6 feet tall should no problem . only three very minor complaints : 1 ) if you adjust length lot different users , it kind pain change , however , we it rug , hard floor this may not much issue . 2 ) if you get off it more than five minutes timer resets back zero . 3 ) seat cushioned , but still little hard ; i put extra cushion it . otherwise , we love it . it excellent value	-1
box it arrived badly damaged elliptical almost fell out bottom when we picked up box bring it inside . i surprised pieces weren't missing . i started put it together it took 45 minutes . directions easy follow , except nuts bolts , i guessed which ones they referring because there no guide tells you which one which . getting pedal bars base machine most difficult task . time i it put together i sweating . after assembly using it very simple it what elliptical should . i find right handle seems move little so i see if i tighten it little more . display went dead just few days but after putting some new non-generic batteries it seems working okay . it easy move around house doesn't take up lot space . when you it it doesn't move around like i read reviews other ellipticals . overall , now i it all put together display works , i am happy it	-1

i bought this bike rehab knee surgery . this price point i willing take chance buy it sight unseen . it works advertised i've incorporated it into my daily exercise routine . bike quiet when use ; i've used wind trainers before sound like cyclones compared this bike . i don't crank tv hear it while pedaling . tensioner 8 levels provides good spectrum wheel resistance . electronics controlling 6 exercise programs , timer , calories burned , distance traveled , pulse all work well . only minor negatives : 1 . setup instructions clear but hooking up tensioner unnecessarily difficult . took 20 minutes lot sweat . 2 . stabilizer bars ( front back ) just tad short , so there slight side-to-side movement you pedal . nothing serious . 3 . you exercise , lcd readout cycles through all stats ... would nice able select what data you monitor . overall i'm happy purchase , esp this price , recommend it others	-1
this unit works advertised . i mounted it using suction cups my windshield lower left hand corner , ran temp sensor cable foot over edge door frame get outside temperature . suction cups work well if you clean glass first . pros : easy setup good results . cons : temp gage too small read easily	-1

i garage full bikes i needed some organization badly . i saw this rack during search amazon it looked like just what i needed . when it arrived i immediately impressed materials construction : it very well made pieces feel substantial . all fasteners allen heads which quality touch . quality such i thought it must made usa ! but alas , after searching packaging carefully , i found elusive " made china " sticker . oh well , what isn't made china ? assembly went well all parts went together without much struggle . follow tip instructions leave all fasteners " loose " until assembly complete . when i got it together tightened all fasteners snugly i hung 4 bikes it it very stable . i say i am very satisfied this product feel comfortable recommending it others .	1
us special ops forces use this compass . this pretty indicative its reliability . i own this compass well silva ranger . they're both great compasses , but i prefer suunto ( spite fact suunto now makes silva compasses well ) . housing indeed easier turn suunto , which handy when you're shooting sight . romer scales base nice , although if you're serious you're probably already carrying transparent romer scale card ( that plastic graphic training aid thingy you take coordinates , all you lt . ' out there ) . when i backpack , i take this suunto well suunto gps plotter compass , working ( surprise ) my map gps . if romer scales baseplate really , really important you , you might look into compass well/or instead , it features more scales just accurate compass . all all , this ultimate baseplate compass , my opinion . i miles miles rifle-piloting us army behind me now hump hills pleasure ; land-navigation passion me . suunto makes tools i find most useful pursuit	1

ok , sword appearance pretty nice , it didn't dissapoint area . i suppose i'm not blind swordsman , so i can't really complain , but it sharp butter knife , possibly little more dull . sword fits scabbard well enough , but when sheathing it gets stuck end , you force it just right way , it not clean i'd like it . all petty nitpicking aside , it nice show piece , maybe little sharpening i could become blind samurai	-1
i bought this device primarily temperature feature , but guess what , it wasn't temperature , it degrees direction . despite my misunderstanding , it accurate . only drawback suction cups not work windshield . i keep it my glove compartment pull it out when i'm lost . backlight not useful because it too dim . might well left off sold it couple bucks less	-1

bandflex comes two large boxes , each around 70 pounds . i surprised ups delivered them , since i got note amazon indicating eagle freight handling shipping . ( btw , this one those times when amazon prime pays itself , since shipping free under prime , but pretty costly without it . ) one box contains long arms beams , other contains base other smaller parts . there many bolts very similar ( but not identical ) lengths , sorting them out keeping track them during assembly time-consuming . two cresent wrenches required bolt gym together , phillips-head screwdriver . i would suggest using tape measure or ruler sort out bolts . assembly diagrams instructions owner manual adequate , but could clearer . overall , assembly took me 3 hours . only really tricky part attaching bungie cords -- pulleys they ride over -- gym . 3 cords ( each side ) need stretched little while you thread single bolt through all 3 pulleys keep cords slipping out or pulleys moving out alignment or bolt missing hole it mounts . one pulley set pre-assembled factory over-tightened needed loosened bit , which easy . when , gym very solid sturdy . i suspect it actually standard " stack " weight gym modified use bungie cords instead weight stack , which fine me , since it probably part reason it such low price compared competition . plus it keeps overall weight gym down around 140 pounds or so , which means i put it second floor my apartment without worrying overstressing loft floorboards . gym several attachments allows many exercises , including unexpected ones like rowing ( complete rolling seat ) . since cords increase resistance you stretch them , they give plenty " weight " end -- perhaps much more than 10/25/35 pounds suggested manual . other hand , they give less resistance start exercise . overall , i find exercises challenging , i'm still ways using all 3 cords once . plus , there isn't too much " transforming " needed ready gym next exercise type . reviewer suggested , cutting off safety clips bands makes changes resistance much easier ( but caused cords spontaneously unclip me couple times , so proceed caution ) . adding carabiners cord hooks cable rings * might * workable alternative cutting clips . however , changes resistance all exercises use " lower " pulley/cable set hard , you need duck under bench attach/detach pre-tensioned bands onto very small metal ring . pulldown bar uses this same cable , so it same issue . gym really fold up into surprisingly small footprint , rollers back aid positioning . but it definitely full-sized gym when unfolded , so it needs bit space . overall , i'm quite pleased gym . my biggest complaint , when starting exercises use bench incline ( like fly or bench presses ) , it very difficult reach waaaay down behind you grab cord handles , they're floor base gym . i've found hooking handle cords through training belt then draping belt over bench helps -- least reach isn't so bad , but it still isn't ideal . some sort velcro or hook back-top bench where handles could hang until needed would help lot . other than , i think gym sturdy , very usable , definite bargain price	-1
stamina definitely not bowflex , but then i can't afford bowflex . i really like sliding seat doing rowing type exercises . stamina wasn't too hard assemble , but there some quality issues parts i correct get everything fit together . my main complaint difficulty changing resistance bands . much this taken care cutting off plastic safety clips -- they really aren't needed . there also quality issues length ropes not even , which i correct knoting one . however , overall i'm pleased value	-1

after several pedometers through years became damaged after their clips either broke or slipped off my waist , i decided purchase via wrist pedometer . so far , via wrist performed very well . it 5 primary operational modes ( time , step , user data , alarm , chronograph ) . step mode 5 sub modes ( step/time , step/kcal , step/distance miles or kilometers , timer , steps target ) . user data mode allows user input his/her age , gender , weight lbs . or kg ., stride inches or centimeters . step/mileage counter appears accurate when i compared it one my expensive " waist " pedometers . via plastic wrist band which may or may not pose problem over long term . i plan purchasing via wrist pedometer gift relative who cross country jogger .	1

reviewer hinted , it probably wouldn't very hard make one yourself , it really just rope handle one hand flattened piece fits closed door stop it keep it slipping through . here what i like it : you know how fitness books always say : " don't let your feet get front your knees when you squat " . you can't much squat following rule , unless you something like this : you lean back while squatting , thereby keeping your shins vertical whole movement . perfect technique ! even better , you hold only one hand , effort your core keep position makes this more complete exercise , ( i don't know weight capacity this piece , so i won't advise this just yet , but one-handed grip straight-shin squat heavy dumbell other hand incredible exercise . ) not downplay other uses , but this alone worth price .	1

combination both magnetic resistance well fluid resistance makes trainer good job creating true road experience . there no adjustments other than adjusting trainer wheel diameter your bike . you change gears wheel spins faster , you experience resistance you would encounter road wind pushing you back . even after hour moderate speed , fluid magnetic units only moderately warm touch . heavy flywheel helps add smoothness ride . if you using slick road tire , amount noise generated relatively small . there some minor assembly required , but instructions well translated illustrated . even 5mm hex tool included . i recommend also getting riser , if one not included , allow proper leveling bike . unit comes skewer , which installed easily your bike case one already bike not fit lugs trainer clamp bike trainer . my case skewer already bike ( giant ) worked fine . i recommend this trainer step up those only magnetic resistance price point nearly hundred dollars below premium all fluid drive models market	-1

ok 1 instructions [ ... ] so unless you good understanding how airsoft guns work then i don't suggest unscrewing any screws2 i also experienced steady decline fps my friends so i determined find out cause . i thought it some kind loss pressure sure enough i right there o-ring attached bolt it slipped off where it supposed go . i popped it back into place after 1-2 hours fiddling i finally got dang thing back together , there lots small parts spring lots grease which doesn't help , it worked like new , so if you want take apart gun fix it every month or so then go ahead buy it but if you don't then don't buy it ( it only 35 bucks what you expect	-1
this gun came 3 days wen i ordered it , ive airsofting4 while alot my friends tokyo maruisand theirs shoot like 300fps up thier consistantly accurate .. this gun accurate if you use 20g bbs instead 12g . 12g cheaper , but when u shoot they go 22 feet curve what ever way they want ... one thing clip only holds 30-50 bbs ... if you try u fit 70 but i like fit only 30 or twenty so i rely skill rather than automatic ... i like play orchord(lots trees ) i knida wish guns orange tip wasnt so bright ... somtimes i think gun could use sling sliencer real scope ... scope came only good looks scaring people ... sights work way better.it hits really hard 300fps ... i recomend upgrade battery motor so u play longer shoot farther .... it shoot pretty far . when automatic it spools up shoots harder really fast . i recomend buying 330round clip it only 30 bucks more it saves your behind ....	-1

this eliptical not good heavy ones you find gym , but it almost good , cost it especially appealing . it took 2 hours assemble , but i'm not expert mechanical devices , so , reader , you probably cut it down 1 hour ( nevertheless after two hours i felt uncommon sense elation ) . users my eliptical 150 pounds 99 pounds respectively ( but i'm sure it take up 250 pounds -- both us together perhaps ) , it move little ( i exercise vigorously , so it moved 3 feet this morning ) during exercising , but under 300$ it worth it . definitely , worth it	1

i searched long hard bike trailer/stoller , but nowhere could i find mention this product front tire . so , i am writing it first , front tire rubber needs inflated prior use , just like back tires . overall , this great product price . it fit my budget safety concerns . manufacturer details many reviews say you not need tools assemble so it very easy put together . i found while it simple put together , attaching it my bike bit challenge . you need bend tow bar fit coupler your bike , which difficult first few times . bug/rain cover tight first few times well , or it could way i attching it velcro i streching it one side other . however , i think it good material stiff begining it tends strech time use . my son loves kick his feet up against screen where velcro attaches top front together , it seems holding up pretty good . trailer itself wide i could not fit it through my door . this largely due covers around wheels . i older house so back then they didn't seem concerned door width . most stores automatic doors which more than wide enough . i go movie rental chain trailer just barely fit . i only one child so bringing handle bar stoller easy , but seems awkward if two children riding it . i seen reviews mention both children plenty even cargo . product comes safety strap handle bar when using stroller ( not pictured many shots i've seen ) brake straps you hook around tires ( also not pictured ) . belts inside not your typical 5 point harness shoulder straps , lap belt crotch straps not connect single point . lap belt must put child first tightened , then shoulder straps adjusted height child tightened , then connected crotch strap . shoulder straps slightly paded , but i haven't seen any other bike trailer this price range better padding or any whatsoever . i also found out bike trailers just like cars , every year they new models so previous year model goes sale . if you going avid biker who alternate biking jogging daily dirt trails or beaches or taking your child(ren ) weekend excursions through mountians or rough terrain then this probably isn't bike trailer you . but keep mind , next version up priced way too ( next cheapest i found over $350 just trailer , bike attachment almost $200 stroller kit just much ) .	-1

i bought this particular rower based solely great reviews it received here amazon , i not disappointed . this fantastic rower . it really truly mimic natural rowing motion it very quiet when use . you listen music or watch t.v. not either one driving everyone else out house while you workout . i find rower extremely relaxing workout . i am 40+ female i assembled rower myself under two hours . included putting rowing handles wrong side first go around . what everyone else suggested lay all pieces out . hardware very efficiently packaged segmented package so you only need open parts you need you go through each step . it really couldn't any easier assemble . i bought mine through amazon only gripe i amazon required signature delivery i not home first time so ticked me off because i wasn't aware need signature . just forewarned if you aren't usually home when your ups deliveries arrive . if you're into rowing fun exercise , you love this kettler rower	1
when i travel i always travel week time , stay condo , where there clothes washer . so taking lot clothes not nessessary . this backpack large enough 3 skirts , 1 pair capris , 6 summer tops , 1 zip-up hoodie , 1 beach towel , bathing suit , underwear , 2 pairs sandals , bag personal care products . small detachable backpack perfect liquid bath products extremly convenient when checking through security airports . two zipped together before bording it one bag , therefore you additional carry-on . when you get your seat just un-zip little pack they both fit over-head bins , you keep third bag your feet ! airlines lost my checked luggage two different trips , taking joy out traveling . so when i found this piece i knew i would not check luggage again unless i wanted ! i not use big bag backpack but i looked straps they made quality materials , i know i won't hessitate use it cappacity . my daughter planning trip through europe next year already asked borrow mine . shhh ,,, don't tell her , but she getting one her college graduation !!	1

wow , i admit this indeed very great sword . most people selling this sword 89-99 dollars . this sword only $45 it same sword other ones . me , shipping 20 dollars , so makes it $65 total . some people think since this sword half cost other ones same kind , it might kind shabby poorly made . this not true . my sword perfectly made it pristine condition when i got it . only problem there small scratch sheath , but it so small it not even noticable unless you get your face really close it . i highly recommend this sword any sword collector , not just bleach fans . if you bleach fan , you get this ... seriously , you get it . not waste your money ones cost twice much	1
it relatively easy assemble , although i smash my finger pretty good while attaching elastic cord . resistance not great , even if you pull really hard , so it take longer " feel burn " this rower compared others . but , it only $200 , you get good workout if you put little extra time	-1

come , what good 5-inch stick street ? answer " plenty . " many people who would turn their noses up pocket stick wouldn't hesitate defend themselves their knuckles . you might see people like this walking around bandages , splints , or casts , because hands soft , small bones , heads big , thick bones full teeth . but even cement heads street criminals don't fare well against hard metal . good hammer fist one these cause even tough guy see fireworks canary birds . i wrote review pocket stick : let not kid around . this may touted nonlethal weapon , it may ( or may not ) look better you if it turns up search or court than , say , knife or gun , but purpose this or any effective weapon harm attacker until he cannot attack anymore . it injure , maim , or kill just surely bullet -- just not so easily . so before you bonk someone coconut this little item , make sure you consider moral , spiritual , legal consequences . this brings up vital point . salesmen , martial arts instructors , your lawyer may well-advised call this " defensive weapon . " fine , but out there world , there no such thing . calling this " hesitation " stick showing judo masters using it submission tool fancy joint locks just distracts what you doing it if , god forbid , need arises . bashing criminal assailant until he unable ( or unwilling ) continue his assault , preferably before he ever gets one shot you . assisting you this purpose pocket stick handy size shape . you stick it back pocket like pen it out attack it quicker than any weapon i know , chances relatively good your attacker never see it literally not know what hitting him . this especially advantageous if two nasties closing but haven't struck yet . you hit first then see if second punk wants step over his buddy face one-on-one odds . while he thinking it over , you run . you see , this not what usually called defensive mindset . i'd take keyring off because it way . i really don't see point hanging keys weapon . it supposed make us think it not really weapon so we feel better ourselves ? no , thanks . anyway , mine my back pocket next my wallet	1

this thing great doing squats . shape conforms neck/shoulder/trap area nicely actually distributes weight across your back more evenly ; much moreso than those round pads or bar alone . very comfortable your back so you focus pushing weight . thing i really like it once you center pad bar ( it pops right off ) you know sure your body centered under weight , so you're not teetering . plastic flexible soft enough so it comfortable it super easy clean .	1
