even if you're " conservative , " you gotta admit this one worst magazines around . if you like good writing , don't even try this one . " one star " still too generous my opinion .	-1
i got this magazine gift , starting few months back . i really can't say i'm impressed . admittedly , i'm much more left leaning than this conservative ( sometimes very , very conservative ) magazine . dispite my bias , i still recognize good writing well made points - this magazine generally lacks both . this isn't say i've never seen good point or anything , they're just fairly rare . if you want read well-written , well-argued , conservative mag this isn't it	-1
great filling doctors office magazine selection - if it free - but not worth your money own . i bought if gardening inspiration there really nothing gardens or gardening here . oh , once while they remember put garden shot magazine , but not consistently . home section isn't inspirational either . go it if it free , but if it not , don't buy it	-1

i decided i write review newsweek this morning , after i came across yet biased , over-hyped cover story . this particular one entitled , " rethinking marriage crunch , " goes back everything they presented 20 years ago woman chances getting married later life . this undoubtedly very easy them they probably no evidence their assertion first time around , neglected any this occasion . i really think reviewer comparison people quite apt , but newsweek also provides reliably pro-sexual revolution pro-sixties counter-culture take almost every issue . two years ago , we made privy bit front page sensationalism concerning " infidelity chic . " yes , it seems , according their sources , spousal cheating all rage even though they argue , without even hint contradiction , everybody still wants get married much ever before . i find magazine [ ... ] they offer opinion instead news ; theirs mission persuasion . overall , there little which recommend this publication it geared readership trivial people who possess depth kiddy pool .	-1
i've subscribed self on-and-off 15 years , but recently feeling like i've outgrown magazine . articles seem focus issues facing single women who just starting their careers . fine , but not me anymore ! also , their subscription department terrible ! my most recent subscription plagued missed issues , double issues late issues -- customer service department can't quite pull themselves together .	-1
i received my first " issue " modern bride mail yesterday . it just cover magazine , nothing else ! now i'll go through trouble ordering replacement . yourself favor just go news stand buy one	-1

if i could give this no stars i would . i bought this magazine because nickelodeon programs my sons favorite watch . i bet they banking when they made this sorry exuse children magazine . not even half magazine ad free !!!! i bought this keep my son busy flight , he looked it maybe two minutes . i wondered why , since he loves everything else nick , so i looked inside myself . boy i dissapointed . instead quality children material i hoped , it just ad after ad . i'm glad i only bought one issue airport , instead one unfortunate people purchase entire subscription before seeing it lack content . if you want great children magazine , go ladybug younger children cricket older children . they both high quality they aren't stuffed full advertisements like nick	-1
one year subscription this magazine not renew it . simply because its vulgar materialism extreme . they say we americans obese body , but magazines like this show many also obese when it comes materialism . page after page glossy ads things we not need . rooms full what amounts dust collections . sure they make pretty pictures , but who wants all ' junk ' probably no real sentimental value but more what someone else told us we need feel whole or successful . i recommend magazine dwell which more holistic approach place live also wont mean hours cleaning . someone who professes so concerned down trodden , oprah would better set better example living simply . how many homes one american need , when so many americans cannot afford even one	-1

laptop magazine focuses laptops , pdas , wireless computing . laptop magazine seems like it trying both technical exciting ; however it lacks objectivity pc magazine deep enthusiasm wired . thus , it reads like series infomercials where each quot ; articlequot ; paints rose-colored view each technology vendors products followed paid ads same vendors portrayed so happily text . their conclusions all seem predetermined : new technology better	-1
i'm sure this review isn't unique . spin rotates same ten bands its cover , not mention ridiculous articles written within . time they get describing ' euro-punk-indie-pop artist just slammed them face their way train station their jazzed up sound ' i've completely forgotten point thier article . they must greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they tag onto useless music still manage say nothing . they sound like cyber-nerds who need get out little more stop getting thier info mtv.com . i'm sure i've learned more what thier editors office any given day than anything remotely close music while reading spin . next time you see it stands , i suggest you spin direction	-1
spin anything try stay hip . i wanted gag when i saw picture blink 182 their quot ; tributequot ; kurt cobain mag . im huge nirvana fan only good thing those articles pictures . they poorly written dull . they didnt even scrape surface kurt music , his impact entire generation . i suggest maybe guitar world or anything other then spin ..	-1
this mag people who think they computer experts because they change out video card or follow directions changing os setting . shallow coverage , some lamest humor you ever come across . it nothing more then rehash what freely easily available internet . there nothing original this mag , ever . also it tends copy paste much issue 12 months earlier . all main articles nearly same every 12 months . don't believe me ? take two magazines 12 months apart compare them . reviews also weak . nearly every month you see : fastest system we ever tested !!!!! yaaaaawwwwwwnnnnn . who cares ? anyone who knows even slightest computers knows speed not most important attribute , even gamers . besides , it really matter system . 00005% faster their poor testing system then computer ? second star mr halfhills column . it only part consistantly interesting only person there real technical know-how . read toms hardware whatever tech news you want , learn how use search engines , skip this pointless mag	-1
this magazine all puff -- if you're looking honest insightful reviews , this not your read . however , if you already know all artists they profile just like pretty pictures them , this magazine worth buying sampler disc included every issue	-1
i am time person year 2003 ( shared title - actively deployed u.s. servicemembers ) . i must say reading time magazine like reading platform democratic party . actually it even worse than it like reading john dean diary , filled more fantasy personal wishes than actual reality . one latest online edition realists taken over washington . give me break . new set hogs come take over troff it . anyone who believes nancy pelosi her gang political hacks going help america fool . best thing we hope they create so much gridlock no one spend any money washington . maybe then they see america improves its own politicians both side make things awful . sad thing people read this publication actually think they walk away knowing something world . this publication so biased it not only misinforms its readers it makes them look like fools when they try repeat what they " learned " . if you want truly useful weekly news publication then subscribe economist . it probably not change your political affiliations but it least make you sound competent when you debate others . economist quite simply best weekly news magazine existence . articles well written people know what they talking . leaders around world read contribute economist . this something time , newsweek rest their ilk cannot claim . i am not affiliated any political parties not consider myself political . i look things economic perspective vote accordingly	-1
it would nice if i writing magazine content here but since i never received single copy my subscription . all i say their customer service sucks !!!! after repeated attempts correct delivery address or find out what happened issue still hasn't resolved . note;i've number delivery problems when ordering magazines amazon ( there might some glitch ) . however other magazines quickly corrected problem soon after contact .	-1
amazon ad said next day shipping . took over month first magazine arrive . not buy this amazo	-1
more more , all industry wants tell you what it you supposed like , ridicule anything we might consider guilty pleasure , if you indulge such thing , you ' shallow ' . music evolved past this attitude , no one believes this naked emperor anymore . oh yeah , their politics so mixed up , they don't even know what they believe anymore . i subscriber eleven years , my renewal notice came , i couldn't come up one good reason send it	-1
this used pretty decent music magazine . not best out there , but still decent . however , rolling stone taken huge nose-dive past ten or so years . i'm not sure i'd even really call it music magazine anymore . it more pop-culture magazine panders teeny-boppers . music magazine main focus should music , but rs over years started including more more articles tv shows , movies , politics , etc less less music ... especially less less good music . if you want magazine pop-culture go entertainment weekly . it , least , bit taste here there doesn't spout off politics . if i want politics , i'll read newspaper or watch cnn . i don't buy music magazines politics . i buy them music . if you want good music magazine , this isn't place look anymore .	-1
i subscibe this magazine . not renew it either ! maybe i am too old appreciate this periodical . it way overpriced even amazom , others discount	-1
... 1 ) i can't; 2 ) second thought , it deserves least one star some silly , funny stuff you don't find other magazines . said , it grossly overrated . how it consistently top sellers list ? well , there many millions folks below average iq there above average . it too bad they can't play up silly humor bit more while leaving abhorrent juvenileness out . images generally trashy sometimes airbrushed point it looks fake ridiculous -- they could improve quality photos lot . admit it , you would probably hide issue if you ran into anyone you actually respected . doesn't say it all ? reconsider standards you setting yourself , respect your own brain , too	-1

amazon sells one year subscription $14 which includes $5 amazon certificate you get later.in actual magazine , subscription card 6.99 one year or 2 years $10.00 so use card , save some money also dont wait your $5 back then find something amazon you use $5 certificate .	-1
they allowed me try one issue before i paid subscription . after i read first issue , i decided cancel . there couple good topics but articles poorly written , example , you couldn't see clearly what conclusions or recommendations . rest magazines all advertisements , which you get free internet ( or just anywhere )	-1
it several weeks still no magazine money !!!! oh yeah but they remember bill my credit card timely fashion .... maybe when something takes over month you should bill person when u ship product !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
i subscriber few years found alot articles repetitive not all educational . recently i subscribed shutterbug which much better magazine both novice professional photographer . its articles insightful even after many years they still teach this old photographer few new tricks !!!!	-1
i under impression this literary magazine would full fiction , short stories , essays , book reviews , literary criticism . instead i received magazine discusses political issues . magazine know what it wants ? they recently released special fiction issue newsstands . why would they if they're becoming political magazine ? they want news/political magazines such time , u.s. news world report , newsweek or they want literary magazine ? they're doing poor job establishing themselves drawing line what they want . i regret subscribing because i felt mislead . course atlantic staff , turning magazine into political direction probably bring them more sales . i don't think reading literary magazines dead any means but format needs revamped so people want read it .	-1
writer digest puts out lot great resources writers . magazine ain't one them , however . starters half magazine ads - mostly other writer digest products . one you get past paying $19.95 year what essentially brochure , you'll notice most articles don't apply you . most writers stick one genre , yet magazine focuses all aspects writing - fiction , poetry , business writing , editing , non-fiction , etc . if you're working biography . edgar hoover , you need look article poetry stlye ee cummings ? i'll take " no " $600 , alex . so , now you're down 10 pages might relevant . well , let start chipping away : letters grammar questions waste : if you question affect versus effect , would you write magazine wait month or two or would you pick up your style guide answer less time than it took you read this sentence ? thought so . ( furthermore idea someone would write magazine question like so incredulous one wonder if questions aren't just submitted staff members attempt fill space , like i used when i news editor my college paper . ) writer digest review software other technology might useful writers . my favorite when it reviewed microsoft word . thanks - i'm sure most readers no idea monopolistic word-processing program . fair , some reviews useful , although you get better information just looking up product amazon.com reading reviews there . if you're going writer digest market information , you'd better served elsewhere : annual writer market publication all markets more thorough , whilst writer market website all information up-to-date . your money would better spent those two products . only articles i found useful profiles authors how they succeeded . there you it : two or three pages issue useful . if you're trying get your work published , writer digest several other products better investment than its magazine : go annual writer market book , website , pick up style manual your choosing ( chicago best ) . don't waste your money this magazine	-1

where macworld bad , addict dreadful . it dumbed down level teen beat , " reviews " don't deserve name . extent which it drools over apple embarassing , leaving no pretence independence . like its competitor , it exploits crummy support typifies computer industry , so we get articles " secrets " such such product .

member southern family who treasured this magazine , it heavy heart sense loss i decided not renew my subscription this year . yes , i've always given brides our family subscription gift , waited eagerly my issue come mail . but those days past . southern living magazine offered all states some time now , i believe this caused editors try appeal broader readership . this , turn , changed recipe section into something one find any other magazine . honestly , i love all sorts different cuisines , but magazine called " southern living " , i expect find wonderful traditional southern recipes ! this magazine needs go back it roots . now , i'll giving new brides subscription southern lady magazine , that what i'll reading myself ! i miss christmas book , though .	-1

i not review something i not received . i thought i would received my first issue now but not . if when i receive magazien i order i happy review	-1
i yet see pw review anything not vetted pc police , not mention utterly stupid . when they want pan book , they apparently list criticisms they pick random , such " non sequitur " or " murky argument " or " reductionist " . they pick them throwing darts list writing down whatever phrases darts hit , ways prove they don't actually any understanding what terms mean . it especially annoying because even when it book i like , i easily see criticisms someone different worldview could make would valid , but they don't make them ; would require work . reviews so shoddy wildly inaccurate i thought asking amazon.com stop using them product info pages , but then it occurred me any book pw pans guaranteed good , so they useful backwards way . anytime pw praises book , i don't bother it , but if they attack it , i know it going great	-1
lucky magazine makes me feel not so lucky . it makes me sad i not afford all items they put their magazine . one month they tell me round-toed shoes show me 50 pictures shoes i would love own which 2 i afford . then following month lucky tells me round-toed shoes out square-toed shoes show me 50 pictures . you get idea ? this magazine based trends you broke if you try keep up feel bad if you can't afford all great things it showing . i enjoy lucky it profiles upcoming designers , some great website links , one or two affordable items it toss each section . i also got few ideas how wear clothing new different ways . most time , though , i felt sad envious after i finished reading it . these feelings i'd rather not encounter . i think i would enjoy it more if it more informative discussing quality differences items they showing , maybe testing them out different situations help me make best choice my purchases .	-1

i would agree previous reviewers , burgeoning ads this magazine over past decade made magazine chore read . number ads now easily exceed number pages devoted articles . it also quite disturbing note many those ads ( possibly 50% or higher ) pitch ultra high end products , such viking ranges , bmw , oceanna cruises , trips bora bora ... wtf ? although i enjoy i luxury meal , i don't want go into massive credit card debt purchasing products this magazine selling . ocassionally , behind clutter , i find useful recipe ; i rarely find interesting article . i am going let my subscription expire end current period	-1

i like read cook illustrated library . their magazine much too expensive small amount recipes included within . i like tips sent readers , some product reviews . i found most their recipes very involved -- nitpicky , kind . lemon meringue pie recipe -- which i tried their " america test kitchen " cookbook -- calls cooking cornstarch water , cooling it , then beating solution into meringue . supposedly this keeps meringue destabilizing . all happened my kitchen i found little lumps cornstarch glue bottom my mixing bowl while scraping out meringue . i made meringue before without cornstarch , can't help thinking this extra step isn't neccessary . their " best " brownies good , but i make equally good brownies without all extra steps involved melting chocolate cooling it , etc . if you're looking easy , fool proof recipes , don't take gazillion steps aren't fussy exactly what ingredients you use , this isn't magazine you	-1
i should preface this reveiw fact i am accomplished home cook . i cooking 25 years own more than 500 cookbooks . i not buy commercially prepared products like breads , crackers , mayonnaise or salad dressings . i make these items myself . i suspect i am not target audience this publication . may/june 2006 issue 32 pages length total . given there only 6 issues year , i expecting little more than mere 32 pages . may/june 2006 issue contains following information : simplifying moroccan chickenbringing home fish chipsgrilled tomato salsagrilled london broilmain-dish vegetable stir-frieshow cook pastafoolproof veal scaloppinia new twist chicken saladsgarlic olive oil mashed potatoesutimate turtle browniesbest strawberry cream cakethe scoop vanilla ice creama review tongsif you experienced cook their isn't much cooking this issue new you . this issue contained not single piece new information me cooking . however , i enjoyed equipment reveiws find them informative useful . this magazine would helpful if someone inexperienced cook . bottom line , i not renewing my subscription unless future issues little " more meat " their content . i think this magazine overpriced what you receive . i would suggest saving price subscription buy their " best " cookbook instead . it costs same amount , contains many more recipes , many their equipment reviews bound hard cover so it hold up longer . additionally , check out issue " fine cooking " which test kitchen type publication , just more depth .	-1

there time when liberalism connotation deep thinking , tolerance , openness healthy , civil debate . no longer . harper perfect symbol all ails left . call this magazine " left leaning " farce . it doesn't lean ... it completely , totally , enthusiastically , blindly tumbles falls into " far left " swamp . tone often hysterically shrilly partisan , reflecting ongoing deafness disconnection leftist media elites towards mainstream america . quality writing feature selection declined precipitously through recent years . this rag credible now guardian , national enquirer , or , come think it , new york times ! save your money , lol !	-1

occasionally when i go grocery store i pick up magazine check out counter . so i bought issue fitness magazine then decided get subscription . i don't know what heck i thinking . each time i got issue i noticed there always some skinny blond chick cover wearing bikini . there never any women color cover . so when i sent letter , asking if i'd like renew my subscription , i said he11 no . i'm not wasting my money so-called fitness magazine doesn't feature women color its cover . there just no way . i thought fitness everybody , not just skinny blondes who wear bikinis . just because your skinny doesn't make you `fit ' either . skip this if possible	-1
i hopes this magazine would nice alternative others out there . moment i opened it , it felt so smug . i gave it chance read it cover cover ( april issue ) . but what finally me ( after read i could buy $800 blouse make me feel pretty after pregnancy stage , i could match my children shoes my jimmy choo finally i could buy my child latest $300 tricycle ) article entitled " normal " child who misdiagnosed autism . article discussed how distraught mother after her child diagnosed autism point she tried committ suicide . article ended fact child turned out genius . what point this article ? say thank god it wasn't true ? what those parents out there who autistic child , how this article make them feel ? article painful insensitive . there better ways spend you $10 than cookie	-1

this magazine just page after page hollywood p.r. agencies releases . unbelievable . why didn't i think it ? i know all magazines look editorial content outside sources , but other than few pages very subjective movie/music/book reviews , this magazine just re-writes prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again again again . this magazine must not staff writers , but must employ army copy editors manning warehouse dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes . funniest thing this magazine how first few pages may dedicated typically obsequious press release provided , say , tom cruise management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - then you turn movie review section where some clever , sassy , wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds tell you movie absolutely sucks . uh , okay - wait , didn't you get press release ? if you tivo extra theme entertainment tonight your ringtone , this magazine right up your alley . otherwise , don't waste penny this nonsense .	-1
i subscribe online edition you receive through email pdf form . i looking forward reading reviews latest audiobooks hearing what reviewers thought them . frankly i disappointed . reviews little more than 1 paragraph plot synopsis , ( same info which might gleaned looking up title amazon.com or reading back book ) . reviewers add 1 sentence or so title call it review ... please . they also fairly out date . most audio titles reviewed older titles which out while . some titles aren't available anywhere i figure . whats point reviewing audio title you can't find ? my interest primariy sci-fi , horror romantic-horror . most titles audiofile reviews fiction . articles aren't particularly interesting . frankly i could care less what narrator thinks or feels , long they good voice . there also sort ... literay snob tone audiofile . i get feeling they like certain authors certain titles tend overly focus them . i'd really like see audiofile ' coming soon ' review column . it would very useful know what titles coming out future . i'd also like see more romance , dark fantasy , horror reviews , or least make section focusing different genres little more clear . i also think sections focussing children titles self-help little large . 2 stars . if you must subscribe , get online version . way you cancel anytime , don't worry subscription problems	-1
reviewers this magazine sometimes hit mark write style insight , but also there many shallow cheap shot reviews very anemic wanna-be true cultural wits like mencken updike . some reviewers suppositions sound though they grad student interns , havent yet lived long field writing form seasoned viewpoints supportable . i'd pass this superficial pop culture mag , save your money buy books nourish you .	-1
i've watching this magazine slide downhill some time , but they've finally hit bottom . bulk april 25 2006 magazine devoted cars . yes , todays automobiles becoming highly computerized , but magazine supposed highlight software hardware we use our desktops . pc mag drifting far afield , doing articles apple computers , gaming systems , extensive reviews cameras . instead pcs , subject seems anything computer chip it , or some way remotely related computers . obvious inference there nothing interesting going pc world , so they keep stretching just fill pages . i find hard believe ; i think it more likely staff lost their focus , or they've hired people who not interested or qualified write pcs . lack pertinent content makes dwindling size magazine even more apparent . what used rival small phone book now size time magazine . they now " new look " , it awful . their readership used consist well educated , technically sophisticated professionals . these people don't need dozen arrows pointing into every photograph , cutesy " handwritten " notes belaboring obvious . that more appropriate folks who hard time getting through high school short attention spans . compare this issue issues couple years ago , it obvious they've " dumbed down " entire magazine . i've subscribed pc magazine years , considered it " must read " keep up rapidly evolving hardware software pc world . but no more -- it time find one something useful write subject personal computers .	-1
my dad bought this magazine my mom i usually pick up copies browse them . all both my mom her fifties i my twenties browse it it joke . it not special it chucked full ads . cover stories dull boring many articles you would want read one paragraph good information . i find this magazine waste our money . it not getting renewed end subscription . my mom already stated .	-1
i subscriber time over 15 years before reader my parents ' subscription . it pains me say this magazine forgotten what it . frankly , only issues worth their salt those resulting major world event such natural disaster or terror attack ; such events seem energize otherwise listless staff seemingly bored editors newswriters . newsweekly obligation go beyond newspapers -- use extra couple days provide more balanced analytical view . unfortunately time fixes its editorial position beginning story -- any future coverage designed prove time initial position correct . immediate taking editorial position then carried into all future coverage event ; stifling analysis preventing any analytical development beyond first few stories --" we told you so , we told you so . " even worse , coverage lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens which point sensational event becomes ultimate interpretation entire story . can't magazine occasionally admit it wrong rather than turning its eye away story continues burn ? out sight , out mind mantra ... fact , i sometimes debate whether decline this magazine mirrors or outpaces general decline our media ; newspapers failing , television news can't seem get away gory or sensationalistic , even academic journals specialized themselves into irrelevance . we seem greater appreciation comedy than analysis . neutrality dead . frankly , i don't care so much any perceived editorial slant i fact magazine increasingly boring irrelevant . time used excellent coverage trends events outside united states -- no more . iran building nuclear weapons but merits occasional blurb world summary page . african states making vast strides towards democracy , we get article nigerian computer fraud . russia emerging turmoil perestroika its painful transition much teach costs value democracy , but we seem focus only latest roadbomb iraq . japan , one world most influential cultures , week i originally wrote this review ( see 12-month subscription ) merited only snippet regarding royal marriage analysis foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling . somewhere wide world fascinating place or culture which time could send correspondent bring place people alive its readership , instead we get tabloid excrement nature joel stein puerile take pornography social deviants . but most damning fact after reading time one asks : how hell our world become boring ? time try emulating economist rather than enquirer ? someone needs step restore proud tradition complete in-depth coverage -- educate reader world which we live ; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine spotlight any various cultures countries which real interesting events take place every single week . time history potential five-star magazine , if only it would just focus finding reporting news	-1
time long increasingly superficial its news coverage , recent years only accelerated this trend . 60s 70s , it somewhat serious magazine centrist bend ( originally it considered quite conservative ) , but years go it degenerated into more more pop-culture fluff little substance . its part " liberal " media , this inaccurate . recent coverage ( 2004 ) election attempted reduce democratic candidate status non-person . first debate john kerry george . bush not even covered , except one very brief article listing few " fact check " points . instead , cover story wa new products movies , kind sharper image catalog lite . time also gave no coverage whatsoever election afghanistan . it mentioned passing article u.s. election , but i would imagine conservatives would object magazine ignoring signficant world event george . bush pointed one his accomplishments office . my view neither candidate received adequate fair treatment . bias seems favor mr. bush , but it still mostly bland superficial . your money better spent british magazine " economist " which far more substantive . while its editorial viewpoint conservative , it sound fiscal conservatism rather than tent-revivalism currently substitutes conservatism u.s. politics . " economist " also provides liberal viewpoint closest i've found ( dare i say it ) fair-and-balanced approach news . time still entertaining read , but i wouldn't take what they say too seriously . they tend bend political wind	-1

this great magazine , but don't order it through amazon . they go through third party ( snapse magazine)that terrible customer service . i ordered this magazine january six months later ... still no magazine . i called snapse twice told they no record order ( even though i received email confirmation amazon i 17 digit confirmation number ) . they said they would research it get back me . no one called or emailed me status , so two weeks later i called them again . they acted if i just placed order told me it takes 6 8 weeks receive first issue . i won't get my first issue until august . buyer beware ... it could take seven months before you receive your first issue .	-1
practicing photographer not collector , i've very disappointed bw few occasions it crossed my desk ( i've never subscription , so i'm basing this just few issues i've seen ) . quality wise , last issue i received poorly printed - it contained streaks through images rampant misregistration , among other things . paper unimpressive printing itself - line-screen looks quite course . full-colour magazine , it would fine , but one which everything monochrome , i would expect they would print stochastically or higher resolution etc . terms content , every time i've seen this magazine it filled work which typically very well-executed technically but un-innovative un-inspirational , least me . most it hobbyist/dedicated amateur variety , few capital-a artists or professionals . stereotypical nature bodyscape-style photos seem dominate , few examples conceptual , thematic or `high art ' work , i've never seen any fashion or photo-journalism either . we could use more non-technical photography magazines , but bw caters audience obsessed traditionalism imitation old masters such cartier-bresson ansel adams . ps : reading body copy set futura tight leading real pain	-1

please read naomi jakobs ' review relevant magazine below . it captures so brilliantly eloquently heart christian ' post-modern ' kick . if you go out your way claim you're celebrity , then you simply aren't celebrity ( take " fitness celebrity " john basedow example ) . same way , if you go out your way claim post-modern evangelical movement relevant , then you're claim relevancy simply not credible . christian church certainly played vastly significant role past 2000 years . however pop-culturalizing evangelical christianity isn't causing it any more relevant than it when sandi patty or carmen ruled christian top 40 . fact some christians enjoy latest musical fads make concept accepting human blood-sacrifice pardon sins more palatable	-1

i know apr supposed one better poetry magazines out there , i think it one highest circulations any poetry magazine , but it more national enquirer poetry magazines . it large , newspaper-style format contains mostly bad poetry dull articles . you'd better off subscribing poetry , hudson review , texas review , tar river poetry , or any number other journals	-1
i told this magazine good look design ideas . it isn't really , there isn't really much this magazine . it just tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked august september issues only things those two impressed me features elton john out africa fundraiser article julian mcmahon . rest it ads , not classy type ads make advertising tolerable vogue magazine , but same old ads you'll see anywhere else , they annoying . there several nonsense fashion articles likes kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one my professors would call it " plastic person syndrome " ) mark consuelos , waay too much jennifer garner her baby , other weird things , such trend designer cupcakes . i wish i kidding latter , but i am not , nor i $25 spend glorified cupcake just because it jessica alba favorite . there entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because stars it way here . despite size this magazine , there very little sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos same old same old , tips mimicking them . i am not interested becoming teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested seeing vanessa carlton pad . this magazine you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , subscription actually not year ( it says special issues count regular issues magazine ) your life ambition try cupcake bakery new york because some celebrity . this magazine mediocre best , worst part , it exact same fashion advice vogue . i went vogue because there substance their magazine , ads classy very chic . leave this one behind-it looks me like brain fluff read folks aol time warner .	-1

i one entertainment weekly charter subscribers way back 1990 . it started out great -- different , intelligent witty approach entertainment coverage . but financially , things shaky , so magazine dumbed down bit reach wider audience . i couldn't blame editors . it helped them reach needed tipping point , they gained their needed mass audience . ew remained better than any other publication entertainment focus , i kept resubscribing . until 2006 . these last few months , ew fallen off cliff . it become entirely superficial shallow , hardly any substance all . publication design also degraded into teen magazine format . i only imagine editors decided anyone over 30 no longer part their target audience . so , i've let my subscription lapse -- reluctantly , mourning enjoyable magazine used	-1
this magazine shows negative side black men . i find magazine embarrasement african-american community . it seems out all races men world , black men seem want display their lack self control , their love fancy cars , overpriced clothes , which no way helps create wealth our communities . i am also offended this magazine rarely shows black women front cover . until , black men understand this kind pathetic display supposed masculinity stopped , they always stopped police , passed over employment , looked down upon . i wish someone would create magazine black men which shows positive side black man such leaders their community , showing respect love their women , showing everything not hip hip !	-1

my family received this magazine years , but recently we decided not re-new our subscription . this used quality product but it recently gone downhill inclusion more more advertising each issue . this point , nearly half magazine consists advertisements -- this isn't real science magazine it claims , waste money . content not all great . articles often extremely short , too short even pre-teen audience . my kids often wished this magazine included more serious science topics , not just shortened , dumbed-down material . much magazine full " fluff " -- things like word searches picture matching games , which didn't interest my children . content might okay 7-8 year olds children slightly lower reading levels , but older children bored . all all , i'd recommend you simply get regular , adult version national geographic . though articles might too complex children , pictures make up what they can't read . if you're looking more children's-oriented magazine , you're better off muse , high quality general science magazine published smithsonian museum washington , dc . however , muse caters slightly older audience , perhaps ages 9 up .	-1

this magazine part murdoch empire . its worstsin its boring not very conservative . it founded william kristol , john podhoretz fred barnes tobe institutional conservative publication under tight controland deep enough pockets dwarf its smaller rivals . when conservativism living movement , it best characterized collection independent voices who while they respected each other didn't always agree witheach other . now , following murdoch formula , its aboutgetting many people whatever their ideology payroll . price payroll course not rocking boat . reading conservative publications these days like readingthe transcripts someone engaging monologuein echo chamber . its strange there so much " conservative " media today , but most policy decisionsdon't get debated or even discussed among conservatives . they seem more interested covering liberals than discussingideas or making proposals . god sake , no more articlesby those who agnostics their private life talking how america needs more god this or god . if yourgoing religious , least find someone who sincere . no more articles greatness family childless unmarried women who totally devoted careersto exclusion anything else .	-1
i subscribed t+l one year . my wife i found magazine uninformative little value when planning our travels . most magazine seems centered around places go shopping photos accompany articles artistic photos , usually models wearing $ 1,000 outfits , instead informative photos resorts or hotels . recommended travel products tend focus $ 1,200 designer duffels which , while perhaps within reach target demographic , unlikely survive many trips through major airport . addition , my subscription came unrequested automatic renewal . i didn't enjoy magazine nearly every copy my recycle bin within 15 minutes receiving it . however t+l decided i would somehow like renewal although i certainly never requested one . my book , those questionable perhaps unethical business practices .	-1
i would agree preivous comments state this magazine isn't worthy its title . i subscribed before reading review , i hoping find affordable psychology-based read , though some stories interesting i'm sure i'd able find them other magazines like vogue or cosmo . there plenty ads , probably more than stories . much like other reviewers when i first ordered it , it took forever first issue arrive , now its more regular but my subscription soon end no renewal course	-1
psychology today purports deliver latest trends psychological studies layman , but what it really delivers pop psychology whole lot advertisements . i give magazine one star very snazzy layout , second star hiring writers don't insult reader intelligence abusing alliteration ( unlike magazine supposedly aimed intelligent adults ) . however , content consistently concerned more pop culture than lives real people . i also noticed bias against introverts article after article attacks shyness serious character defect , rather than simply personality trait ( so , introverts , if you want avoid yet lecture how your way relating world intrinsically wrong , avoid this rag )	-1

if i could give it zero or negative rating i would . when vibe introduced , it relevant , interesting magazine exposed me new alternative , rb hip hop artists . mag featured all kinds artists not just who hot right now , it also featured hard hitting expose articles relevant not only hip hop community but world . lately i've noticed it nothing more than fluffy version source . i hate lot new rap music that out didn't appreciate mags rappers i dislike cover . it me or it seem like since mimi took over , all female rb singers ' covers stories horrible ( we won't even discuss disgusting brandy cover) ! this magazine sucks now only time i check it out while i'm line grocery store . yes , subscription rates cut bone now but because quality supremely lacking . i'd advise curious check issues out newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money subscription	-1

let me first say i am one martha stewart biggest fans ! i enjoyed msl magazine years loved format " old " show ( new one taking awhile get used ) . i jumped body soul when it first came out , but repeatedly disappointed obvious exclusion anything " male " articles . not mention , articles relationships love never mentioned same sex partners which i find totally unacceptable , unforgivable , just plain stupid marketing standpoint . why exclude men gay people ? i also noticed there no ads advertisers marketing men either . most if not all articles nothing more than " new age " pablum , either " borrowed " or stolen much better magazines such alternative medicine . don't waste your time or money this one . this isn't even good enough line my cat litter box	-1

kissinger , honorary chairman national interest , going head-up 9/11 whitewash commission , but he begged off when families objected . dov zakheim , 2.3 trillion dollar missing unaccounted pentagon funds man , journal board . one better off reading commentary magazine , where least " neocon fascist madmen " ( web tarpley phrase ) state their case clearer more honest - if that word - prose . i remember reading one article national interest which actually made assertion we , meaning usa , need engage terrorism occassion . i couldn't believe they would actually print something like , but they . this fundamentally dishonest journal waste time , most part , because it neither interesting ( statement described above paragraph notwithstanding ) nor meant , main , really other than fool public . kissinger i strong suspicion knows what happened 9/11 so i suspect zakheim ( put it mildly latter case ) , yet they pretend official version true . supporting this journal supporting bad guys	-1

time long increasingly superficial its news coverage , recent years only accelerated this trend . 60s 70s , it somewhat serious magazine centrist bend ( originally it considered quite conservative ) , but years go it degenerated into more more pop-culture fluff little substance . its part " liberal " media , this inaccurate . recent coverage ( 2004 ) election attempted reduce democratic candidate status non-person . first debate john kerry george . bush not even covered , except one very brief article listing few " fact check " points . instead , cover story wa new products movies , kind sharper image catalog lite . time also gave no coverage whatsoever election afghanistan . it mentioned passing article u.s. election , but i would imagine conservatives would object magazine ignoring signficant world event george . bush pointed one his accomplishments office . my view neither candidate received adequate fair treatment . bias seems favor mr. bush , but it still mostly bland superficial . your money better spent british magazine " economist " which far more substantive . while its editorial viewpoint conservative , it sound fiscal conservatism rather than tent-revivalism currently substitutes conservatism u.s. politics . " economist " also provides liberal viewpoint closest i've found ( dare i say it ) fair-and-balanced approach news . time still entertaining read , but i wouldn't take what they say too seriously . they tend bend political wind	-1

i subscribed cooks magazine some years ago , back when it began publishing again . i problems issues failed arrive , wrote them it - never received reply or any note concern . since time , i occasionally glance through it newsstands see if there any articles interest . even dint casual glance , i've begun tire formulaic articles which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients order finally come up " perfect recipe " something or other . i now skip right " perfected " recipe , decide whether its worth committing memory . some explanations success or lack thereof inclusion or exclusion particular ingredient hare-brained bes t.t here also two other areas this magazine disappointed me : 1 . product reviews : they range just plain wrong idiotic . kitchenaid pro 600 hailed cook best its class many mixing chores . yet , amazon reviews tell different tale - one short lifespan when used mix bread dough because plastic gear cover deforms finally comes apart , allowing metal gears separate . christopher kimball ( editor ) once performed evaluation cookware which he calculated price cookware per pound its weight . no , i'm not joking . evaluation , le creuset came out top simply because it heavy . all-clad , even though it conducts heat very evenly , suffered not much heft , therefore judged pricey , pound weight basis . one issue cooks boasted its cover " unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others " . apparently , hershey designated best . not too many months later , callebaut recommended above all others , hershey judged barely acceptable . feeling manipulated yet ? 2 . finally , there those dreadful editorials mr. kimball . rambling , painfully written , punctuated picture mr. kimball wearing bow tie , looking very much if his head held it . mr. kimball humble man , much humble . he writes if he chanelling helen gurley brown , but red black flannel watch-plaid without her sense play . time re-vamp this magazine , folks	-1

back 1970 my grandmother subscribed prevention . time , it wonderful magazine , filled informative articles aimed " prevention " illness promotion wellness ( founder prevention , j.i. rodale preached ) . articles role vitamins nutrition light years ahead their time .

' son ) , takeover his wife daughter , it unfortunately transformed into fluffy , tabloid-like " women magazine " scantily clad women covers , one- or two-page articles instructing women get killer abs burn fat . i think j.i. rodale probably spinning his grave see what his descendents butcher this magazine , which bears no resemblence whatsoever what it used . i flipped through copy disgust recently note , reviewer stated , plenty ads drugs which really seems go against idea preventing illness first place ( whereas old prevention sang praises vitamins health foods ) . i don't know why rodale family doesn't just scrap title call it something else , but alas , they major corporation now i little hope this magazine improve any time soon	-1

i wish when i purchased this subscription i would read all reviews . unlike description included amazon website , subsription not include cd-rom , which costs additional $1/issue . , if you want purchase cd-roms past issues , they cost $4/disk . sometimes bargain isn't really bargain . buyer beware	-1

home business magazine publication aimed those members general populace who either already own home based business or who active interest subject would like pursue it further . this magazine contains articles relating all facets home business ownership initial setup all way through payment taxes year end . i read several different business magazines many them entrepreneurship . home business only one i read specifically devoted starting business home , unfortunately , it many flaws prevent it enjoyable informative read it otherwise could . probably most annoying feature this magazine articles themselves their tendency written list- type format rather than user- friendly way . i realize people like lists but home business takes this little too far . it makes magazine seem callous unfriendly- something you would consult same way you would almanac . example , it common find one page article title like " effective ways design newspaper ad " , or " how obtain quick financing " . each instance , these articles short opening consisting paragraph or two followed numbered listing different methods/suggestions solve problem or answer question . this makes magazine read more like reference guide than piece reading material . thing annoying this magazine endless advertising . not only it get out hand , it also includes all sorts ads emphasize money- making schemes other similar material . advertisements titles like " really lazy guy incredible little secret idea make you rich " , " free $9.95 report shows you how make fortune " , " six figures six months " clutter pages this magazine get- rich quick garbage everyone knows unlikely return even cost introductory package . some parts this magazine more bearable than others it this handful positive attributes prevent me giving this magazine one- star rating . i like some success stories because they depict ordinary people who succeeded making living home- based business . but even here , stories inconsistent . some educational nature while others little valuable information share . make matters worse , they far too short- usually covering only one- half page each large advertisement taking up space bottom each page . speaking advertising , this magazine wrote book advertisement excess . advertisements cover 75 percent pages each issue it rare see even two pages row without some sort advertisement . ads posted everywhere , often right middle article , they distract greatly already limited enjoyment magazine . this magazine assembled together such way it reads like collection articles taken people different parts country shuffled around published one magazine . other words , this magazine no continuity it . it like taking short articles different business newspapers around usa then piecing them together into one magazine . starting home- based business goal many people set themselves there always need some good , timely information when you find yourself this situation . home business , unfortunately , doesn't perform its mission very well . if you dig deeply enough you find few good articles . but majority too impersonal too shallow ( not mention smothered advertisements ) make this magazine worth trouble .	-1
when you watch commercial children television , you accept commercials because , after all , programs " free " . but when you pay subscribe nickelodeon magazine , i don't expect it so so full alluring ads targeting children . these ads appear similar editorial content . it seems like 50% pages advertisements ! i disappointed won't renewing our subscription . better look something highlights magazine series .	-1
like " where waldo " , it seems every issue must least one , if not several mies van der rohe daybeds . while this admitedly classic piece furniture , one gets impression there gaggle designers telling their clients , " you one these , they're what ! " most features metropolitan home suffer same fate ; dreary antiseptic homes same dreary interiors obviously foisted upon gullible , uninformed clients designers who know how make easy buck . " modern " equals , course , mies van der rohe daybed ( notice how many times it shows up this review ? ) , otherwise you get month after month 1970 florals , faux louis whatever tables . even using feature extraction , wading through dreck finding something useable your own purposes , it painful look through this magazine . if you really want ideas making your house reflect you , trust yourself what you like , if you like mies van der rohe daybeds , all means get one . just don't plunk one your sun room because you told it trendy . if you like modern style , look up works hans wegner peter hvidt go there ; their furniture still looks stylish after 50 years hard use real families sturdy well . maybe you want house where nobody allowed set foot any rooms amounts bad hodge-podge styles all seem bit busy bumpy . everyone else , think things you'd like see if you walked into room , save your money skip this magazine	-1
people magazine one worst expressions american life . instead makiing our own lives more meaningful exciting - which possible - people encourages us oogle fixate over people who essentially images , people we never meet , many cases people who very little going them . anyone really think britney spears anything say anything , or paris hilton barely aware her own existence ? it ever make whit difference your life how many times . lo engaged ( order get cover magazine ) or who demi moore grinding today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	-1

writer digest puts out lot great resources writers . magazine ain't one them , however . starters half magazine ads - mostly other writer digest products . one you get past paying $19.95 year what essentially brochure , you'll notice most articles don't apply you . most writers stick one genre , yet magazine focuses all aspects writing - fiction , poetry , business writing , editing , non-fiction , etc . if you're working biography . edgar hoover , you need look article poetry stlye ee cummings ? i'll take " no " $600 , alex . so , now you're down 10 pages might relevant . well , let start chipping away : letters grammar questions waste : if you question affect versus effect , would you write magazine wait month or two or would you pick up your style guide answer less time than it took you read this sentence ? thought so . ( furthermore idea someone would write magazine question like so incredulous one wonder if questions aren't just submitted staff members attempt fill space , like i used when i news editor my college paper . ) writer digest review software other technology might useful writers . my favorite when it reviewed microsoft word . thanks - i'm sure most readers no idea monopolistic word-processing program . fair , some reviews useful , although you get better information just looking up product amazon.com reading reviews there . if you're going writer digest market information , you'd better served elsewhere : annual writer market publication all markets more thorough , whilst writer market website all information up-to-date . your money would better spent those two products . only articles i found useful profiles authors how they succeeded . there you it : two or three pages issue useful . if you're trying get your work published , writer digest several other products better investment than its magazine : go annual writer market book , website , pick up style manual your choosing ( chicago best ) . don't waste your money this magazine	-1
i haven't recieved single copy so i can't really review it . all i say amazom service terrible	-1

i charter subscriber this magazine when it started up publication . it breath fresh air stagnant field almost universally wretched photography magazines . over years things changed . columnists died or moved . editorial directions switched . articles once inspired now only offered consumerist bullfeathers . when digital photography became dominant marketplace , " outdoor photographer " vanguard , pushing every gadget photoshop manipulation plug-in popped up . magazine became wasteland promises better pictures if you just buy _____ ( fill blank whatever current trend might ) . what i thought ironic time best photographs they printed photographers using least sophisticated equipment . photographers using film (!?) , lot large format guys , occasionally some black white stuff made cameras just any serious hobbist already owned . but these portfolios began dwindle occasional rare almost non-existent . some point , my interest this garbage lapsed before my subscription . magazine made once monthly trip mailbox trashcan without even opening it until they finally stopped sending it . " outdoor photographer " impresses people who measure quality photography whether or not equipment used production cost equivalent gross national product small third world countries . it offers little way nutrition hungry mind . it empty calories , just making you want more more while starving your potential . it truly wretched .	-1

i can't imagine how many hours my life i wasted worrying ego-trippin ' jocks . although , i understand how i got hooked this bad habit . rich folk who own our media great job marketing this endless diversion masses . so , instead worrying economic justice , environmental destruction , well-being children so forth ; passion large segment general public frittered away watching one city gladiators combat city gladiators . top , us vs . them pattern thinking encouraged , anthem singing , so many pro sports figures involved right-wing politics ( bernie kosar , john elway , steve largent ) , i've come realize how poltically-charged this so called " escape " actually . top , i just got sick all these sports announcers barking this or , wagging their finger my face . ads sports illustrated also bunch macho [ ... ] . way , before he killed " friendly fire , " pat tillman reading noam chomsky howard zinn books . fact , he arranged meeting chomsky after he returned our war terror . too bad he wasn't able pursue path . my interest sports now limited badminton my backyard , books like " what my name fool ?

friend once said me , " if you want glossy no brainer then get vogue ! " how right she , despite glorious photography , fashion models daren't stand sideways or you wouldn't able see them occasional good article it , i admit i find vogue too pretentious . vogue wants voice fashion , voice high brow media but its clientele likes you me , ordinary people who can't afford live high life they portraying its gloss filled pages . personally i'd rather spend my money movie ticket , i get see good thriller , sci-fi , romance etc , etc i don't know substence abuse emotional demons haunt particular actor life , i'm just interested enjoying myself couple hours before i go back my hard working life real world . vogue trying sell me dream i don't really want buy into , never penchant selling my soul devil , it gets two stars though because photography really superb , shame rest it though	-1

i've receiving this magazine almost 4 years now . it hasn't changed much since i started receiving it ... i pretty much still think it worst teen magazine that still business . i'm 16 now haven't liked it anymore i've gotten older . strangest part this magazine me fact they just keep sending it me ! i mean , i barely even remember when i first subscribed it ( it some kind deal where you get certain magazines like 6 months or something , i didn't many choices so i picked this one ) . eventually other magazines stopped coming . but this one continued come . still ! i would thought it might nice if company made accidental error or something continued send me magazine . i would thrilled if happened any other magazine ( i actually don't mind seventeen , allure , cosmogirl , teenpeople occasionally , or even teen magazine . ) . but this one just makes me wonder if these people downright stupid ... least they could " accidentally " send it someone who likes their magazine ! if person exists ? i think i read fairly broad variety teen magazines these days , so i'll try discuss my dislikes it relation those . so this comparison this one versus : seventeen , cosmogirl , ellegirl ( i suspect it recently went out print however ) , teen magazine , teen people magazine , allure , cosmopolitan , jane magazines . 1 . overall valueconclusion : teen vogue = very low value overpriced . smaller sizefirst off , one easiest things see this magazine when its shelf fact it smaller then others . all my magazines same size . except this one ; which maybe much 2 inches shorter height 1 inch smaller width . i don't know why magazine makers decided this . my opinion , it only draws more attention fact while it around same price other magazines ... they cut out least something make it smaller . sounds like rip off me . ( ... but i'm getting it free some reason , so i guess that hardly my biggest concern . it may yours though ) . cost compared contentmagazine prices little missleading first glance . it easy find thicker magazine assume more pages = better value ? but that not case . abundance ads magazine lead you conclusion , but there good chance you'll disappointed when there hardly any articles ad after ad after ad . way ... those you who aren't familiar teen magazines these days , i hope you realize : they all adsthis truth , but i don't see it terrible thing personally . when i 11 i first found issue teen magazine library , i shocked ad content . but i used read american girl magazine ( which no ads ) so i thought it so bizarre . now i don't mind it . i even save some ads because i like photography looking different angles things . i don't think it fair however , hate teen vogue solely because ads though , all magazines going ads . amount ad content each one main thing varies ; so here my interpretation ... seventeen , cosmogirl - limited ad content ( they more ads towards beginning , then they're much more spread out . seventeen probably my favorite magazine bunch they manage get one ad opposite article few pages then stop ads few pages or so before they it again . i find it highly tolerable)teen magazine - even less ad content . ( i think they've really decreased amount ads over years actually . they probably least ads all my magazines)teen people , ellegirl , jane - more than seventeen cosmogirl but not terrible . allure cosmopolitan = high ad content . ( i almost put them seperately , but they similar . they lot ads i think , but most part , i don't mind . they manage balance most it out enough articles pictures make buying magazine worth while . main difference i see just choice ads . cosmopolitan puts so many ads sex related things many more vulgar ads . allure i like more anyway . i guess cosmopolitan magazine focuses whole lot more sex already , so many teen moms may not appreciate their daughter reading it first place . ) teen vogue = high ad contenti'd say ad content very similar ad content cosmopolitan allure . however , thing pisses me off , fact there isn't enough content balance it out ! ( maybe i mean " meaningful content " but more later ... ) . saddest part this magazine i save more ads then i ever save articles . ads really more exciting then content unfortunately ... 2 . articlesconclusionteen vogue = fluff filled , unimportant menow , generally , i consider seventeen best articles ( cosmogirl close second ) maybe allure although it addressed older crowd . reasons why i actually take time read seventeen articles , although i hardly even bother teen vogue ones : . seventeen writes something actually interests me ( ok , ok , so occasionally they little stinker . but overall , i think they good job . ) teen vogue ... not . i'm interested things i haven't thought before , or personal accounts things i would unsure how react , issues seem happen everywhere but stunning new facts enclosed statistics give me perspective ... etc . i could go . but unfortunately , i don't think teen vogue managed intrigue me . ever . typical teen vogue article something like " truth crystal meth " , " i bullied online ! " , blah blah . i hardly even think anything i've ever interested . they tendency focus things i already know bad , things like drugs especially . it makes me feel like i'm babied ... like " hey , well i bet you didn't know this .... if you this your liver could turn black blue all colors rainbow " then pile bunch tear jerking stories teens who " no idea " dangers _____ drug then something terrible happened . i mean i think it important teens see dangers doing such things ... i just get annoyed rather than enlightened when it seems like such easy obvious thing . particularly when they make big deal it so " unknown " mysterious like nobody ever heard it before , when i know most people i talk every day anyway . if i don't take freaking drug ... i won't worry all problems associated it , sometimes it hard me sympathetic these girls who screw their lives up ( especially when article , they make themselves seem like complete idiots ! ) . i'm not anti drug articles though either . when seventeen one while back , example , it article ( or maybe more chart ? ) " drugs make you ugly " . now i found enlightening very interesting . it didn't focus one drug , but instead one effect many different drugs cause . not only i want use drugs less , i also feel like i'm more able recognize signs its use , so i could identify signs . it important me magazine editors take time teach us something new , without beating us over again same stuff we hear everywhere else . teen vogue just hasn't figured out ye t.b. i find good advice seventeen meaningful . teen vogue ... makes me wonder if i should one giving them good advice ... i think i most disappointed teen vogue this when they article caught my eye girls who addicted tanning . they spent nearly 2 whole pages rambling different girls their tanning habits ( general stupidity ... ) . barely even gave reason why it not good idea . i remember reading one last sentences my head over over again . it like " remember live your life fun , but try safe " . i mean wtf ??! you could talking anything . cooking , driving , sex ... it so generic it stupid . only thing i got article justification there really lot stupid girls who damaging their skin tan , no idea it . unfortunately , if these girls read teen vogue , they probably never know either . 3 . featuresconclusionteen vogue = ... you serious ? um . i can't find better word than worthless describe this magazine features . i used like " room my own " thing they back my issue . it nice inspired way other girls kept their rooms based what they liked . but last year ... i think they managed totally kill part too . uniquenesses interesting things once intrigued me little replaced more mediocre rooms other girls ( lately they've somehow connected famous person . yeah , how exciting ... not ) just don't inspire me all . oh , one second last pages or so , there feature where they find some girl " style " tell her describe it what brands she likes ... blah blah . occasionally ( well , no , rarely ) , there something i actually find interesting want save remember . but most time it just bunch 13 year olds trying trendy throwing coolest things they know ... all same time . no thank you . most other magazines , i appreciate monthly space something hair , or makeup , or something related beauty i could find useful . teen vogue not this . but then again , everytime i seen them slip something those lines , they manage make me question their intelligence . ( " omigod , mom ! teen vogue says i should put glittery pink eyeshadow up my eyebrows so i cool . we go spend $67 now so we exact product they used ! " eek . ) makeup useful ... if you want stage artist perhaps ? i don't know ... i'm still working one . 4 . fashion focusconclusionteen vogue = fashion help extremely wealthy confusedif you disregard fact virtually everything magazine rediculously overpriced just unpractical ... i suppose someone might find their fashion sense useful/inspirational somehow . but i'm afraid i not . i remember skimming through one article answered question asking " how i avoid looking like tourist vacation ? " which they answered showing how you pile bunch random clothing pieces come off idiot instead . how exciting ... they also tendency encourage readers buy things showing us models wearing such clothing . i wouldn't surprised if plus-size community completely gave up them , fact i'm surprised there no outrage over this . look teen vogue , i know gemma ward looks excellent ( ok , i'm lying ... but i pretend , right ? ) . but you see , me gemma , we some differences . example ... her thighs probably less then half size mine , she like half foot taller then me , she weighs maybe half what i , ... well ... she model seems look good everything . i not . i refuse let you convince me such hideous outfit won't look hideous anyone else . actually , i wonder if gemma ward could afford things their magazine . she super model afterall . but maybe after spending $150 each pair underwear ... things begin add up , even her . darn ... bottom line:don't waste your money this magazine ( fact , don't even get it accidentally free like me , it not worth your time ) . if you want buy teen girl magazine subscription , try something like seventeen , cosmogirl , teen people etc . just anything better than this .	-1

i reading this mag off past 20 years . other reviews said , i think i am just reading same tired old stuff three or four issues ago . " big guns ! " " huge chest ! " " massive gains ! " these seem ones you'll see featured every other month here . adds ? don't get me started adds ! when half your magazine adds , it spells trouble . not only , they need specify people who may not already know , " this mag training tips people who not work living spend 6-8 hours day gym , eat 8-10 meals day spend massive amounts cash supplements . " other words , people no real responsibilities other than taking care their physiques ( which far jobs go , that great one ) . i teach all day into night , literally , me eat train like they require , i'd quit my day job , sell my kids into slavery , become homeless person . which case i'd no money gym membership . i think you get idea . positive side , photos awe-inspiring . also , realistic , it mag around decades upon decades . how many different ways you say , " lift heavy , eat like horse , train like you no other responsibilities life " ? it just becomes repetitive any way you slice it . my recommendation would buy issue or two every decade or so . buy january " big guns " issue , then february " huge chest " . then wait decade repeat . good luck	-1

i'm not sure why this magazine so highly rated . sure it o.k. magazine , if you like immersing yourself hype , marketing-speak incredibly superficial language . admittedly pictures pretty obsessed mountain biker i say we like bike porn . i just cannot read any articles . chock full over-the-top adjectives ' xtreme ' language . i don't trust magazine calls every new incremental advancement biking technology ' revolutionary ' or ' amazing ' or any number disgustingly inappropriate modifiers . they ceaselessly use vapid ' technical ' jargon made up sound high-minded high-tech , but nothing more than marketing spew . tech advice column full suspicious letters stench stealth advertising . if there one thing that well thought-out this magazine , it how best bombard reader sales pitches , half-truths hype . short , this magazine blatant industry propaganda . my first advice : don't buy it . if you buy it ( love god ) don't take anything those covers seriously .	-1

if i pick just one women magazine subscribe , " good housekeeping " would one . it many same articles all women magazines : articles health , fitness , finance , relationships , diet , beauty , fashion . but " good housekeeping " goes beyond surface these articles , example , their fashion articles don't focus just high-priced clothing , instead they show outfits look like their expensive counterparts readers buy just fraction cost . there also advice columnists things like household hints , etiquette , relationships . each issue also short story . there also seemingly obligatory celebrity cover interview inside each issue . what i like " good housekeeping " in-depth articles . most magazines today publish articles only page or so long , but many articles " good housekeeping " several pages long . articles often ordinary people making difference world . there usually cautionary articles parents young children and/or teenagers frightening ( recent article sexually abusive male babysitter ) but very useful . many magazines , good housekeeping also on-line counterpart , where readers post messages current issues well enter contests . well worth subscribing .	1

" ; quote : " media say i won election strength moral values . if other fellow become president , would media said he won election strength immoral values ? " ) . all seriousness , this magazine very clear detailed neo-conservative look issues ( neo-con ? - interestingly , it would appear many writers used liberals ) . magazine not always present just conservative perspective , not always agree bush . recent article current liberal , ex-communist british writer his reaction george galloway testimony before us senate . editorial recent issue all dictator uzbekistan , us ally war terror . editorial notes toleration this dictator his brutality undermine bush current foreign policy . it should noted magazine not seem journalists , few staff writers , most appear called " contributing editors .

i discovered am some 2 or 3 years ago . since then , i become addicted reader it . more than any other magazine moment . let start saying what am not : not news , not business , not nice colored pictures . am two main focuses . one current affairs , special focus macro conditions us ( mainly economy politics ) international affairs . other one arts , special focus reviewing high-quality ( sometimes rare ) books . i like am its focus current affairs . this monthly you read long articles issues like , cite some examples come mind : - simulation principals meeting discuss alternatives engage north korea- war game attack iran- presidential candidates , their lives their campaign strategies- state affairs american educational system- potential causes eventual economic crisis usthe am sits same " hall fame " economist foreign affairs . main differences economist relatively short time frame thus focuses news week what they mean mid term . foreign affairs , other hand , more scholarly nature . am sits somehow middle . it written mainly senior journalists ( so it less scholarly ) its monthly focus allows it disentangle itself relative " sameness " every week news . am goes beyond " futility " news reporting but stops before it gets into " boringness " scholarly writing . if you want enrich your view world quality monthly , if you open-minded willing read new points view , if you want get closer real issues behind foreign economic policy , am you . other hand , if you more " shor t-t erm " preocupations , if you more " closed " than open new points view , or if you want look international economic matters more scientific approach , then am not you . again , i said , am also " arts " section . it very good but it not reason why i buy it . other may	1

excellent independent research ! investigative journalism its best . it neither liberal nor conservative publication , neither republicans nor democrats spared . politicians make lot claims , mother jones looks beyond their words see if they actually put them into action . you see when you read mother jones , many politicians ( both democrats republicans ) not " put their money where their mouth . " also , ignore reviews saying it biased . apparently , they consider facts inconvenient run counter their beliefs biased . what interesting if they came across article mother jones supported their beliefs , they agreed , then they would probably say article impartial fair . hey , truth hurts sometimes . finally , reviewers claiming this liberal magazine because it talks bush so often misguided . mother jones so many articles bush because he makes so many claims says so many things not supported his actions . he easy target . they articles kerry others too .	1

i came across " olive " when i london this past may ( 2005 ) . it free supplement month issue " bbc good homes " , so i wasn't expecting much originally . am i ever glad i didn't just toss it bin i would normally ! " olive " devoted cooking , my title suggests , simple , elegant healthy . great editorial photography makes food look great , all its ' recipes use readily available ingredients . each recipe short , telling you what you need how prepare it , not much more . sidebars or runners bottom page contain info related recipes , such how cook perfect steak ( i.e. , " bring steak room temperature ; use very hot pan " " oil meat not pan " ) . under section " fast food " , one these recipes mini wellingtons , only 5 ingredients ready 30 minutes . section details how make signature nobu ( famed sushi restaurant nyc london ) dish , cod miso , recipe isn't all intimidating ( although obtaining some this dish ingredients might difficult unless you access asian market or similar online site ) . gi diet followers also benefit " olive " nearly all recipes contain gi-related nutritional information . chef gordon ramsay also edits column shares his favorite tips recipes . only reason i give " olive " 4 stars instead 5 because many recipes contain both metric imperial measures . however , conversion info metric measures easily available online . " olive " also uses british stove/oven indications , such " heat oven too 200c/fan 180/gas 6 " but i easily able convert these fahrenheit . so why subscribe " olive " instead american cooking magazine ? if you like me , american cooking magazines frustrating , recipes often ( unneccessarily , imo ) complicated , better suited those who cook purpose entertaining large groups people . many healthy cooking magazines don't contain gi index info , fail present it easily understood way . many cooking magazines ' this side pond ' also chock-full ads , you get through them before you get recipes or information prompted you buy mag first place . " olive " clean , uncluttered , appeallingly presented . what not like ?	1

" fortune " classic newsstand , vital important today ever . " fortune " generally caters people managerial bent , especially upper-level executives , but also offers excellent analysis current events business world , global national economic climate , forward-looking technology trend information . each issue normally organized around theme or major story , like enron trial , or 100 best companies work given year . i enjoy articles where they rank things , but more than rankings themselves , i am always interested justifications they use their rankings ; while i don't always agree magazine , i always find it good food though t.t he features generally very polished accurate , lessons conveyed straightforward manner useful ceo college business student . i particularly appreciate interviews " fortune " key players financial industry , also appreciate very useful index companies individuals featured every issue . magazine probably not favorite investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain ; small investors may also want read more specific magazine like " kiplinger . " nonetheless , investment advice insight " fortune " offers should generally held high esteem . i also appreciate coverage key trends , particular want note " fortune " lead excellent reporting pension crisis america : coverage this sort what makes me loyal reader . many other financial magazines available competing your money ; while there several i would recommend , " fortune " remains reliable source information macro-level trends , should part everyone business library	1

this magazine great ! sport-specific magazines , this probably one best i seen . yes , photos large detailed . but , kicker writing . incredible content without wordy . variety topics approaches brings out varying highlights sport . just very impressive	1
if you looking more opinion than straight reporting stats rather than highlights , tsn your sports magazine . years back , tsn seemingly slated go way sport magazine ; one couldn't find niche internet cable era , which ultimately would spell its demise . it also took tsn take body blow usa today - when its baseball weekly cut into readership - overhand rights espn magazine find its way . tsn truly survivor . in-season reporting not based editor deciding what hot . those seeking out quick hits - example - auto racing don't wait indy 500 or nascar chase information . my biggest criticism reliance lists - best , worst , etc . - tend become major stories when certain sports ready crank up year . granted , many radio-talkers pick up lists - oftentimes give compilers time gab it - but these features ultimately fall into " lazy week " gathering news . overall , though , tsn better than ever product any sports fan would find informative .	1
well i echo what all other reviews said this magazine . subscibing this magazine making sure unbiased articles still exist all makes models sports cars . you see there extremely few ads this magazine so even though mag bit smaller than say car driver magazine it loaded front back reviews . one after . photography fantastic just looking pictures makes you wonder what some other mainstream magazines could like if they could just try put out better quality product . even cardstock paper first rate . it makes car driver mag feel so cheap comparison . both come my address i honestly say i look forward both but different reasons . i first stumbled upon this magazine airport 6 years ago i am so glad i . i would love see more articles affordable sports car alternatives they print end each issue . i remember article what used sports cars you could buy certain dollar amounts this me ( man budget ) rather nice look market whole year . also we not all 16 year olds out there subscirbing this magazine so it would nice see road tests least one moderatly priced non exotic each issue . thank you putting together such high quality magazine your readers enjoy .	1

yo he leido varias revistas o magazines como tambien les llaman tales como , seventeen , cosmopolitan , vogue , self , glamour , mademoiselle , teen , lucky , teen vogue , marie claire , por mencionar algunas , tanto las versiones en ingles como en espaol definitivamente me quedo con elle . es superior las demas , primera tiene excelente fotografia muy buenas impresiones , su moda es cosmopolita global , ademas de que presenta diseadores nuevos que aun todavia no son conocidos pero gracias esta revista sus carreras son impulsadas rapidamente la fama , sus propuestas reviews sobre cine , musica , libros teatro tambien son muy buenos , tiene cultura pop pero no es del tipo teenybopper como en otras revistas que se obsesionan con ciertas actrices o cantantes de ahi no salen . sus paginas de moda son preciosas aunque es cierto que muchas de las modelos que salen posando en estas paginas se ve que son anorexicas o le entran las drogas , tampoco me gusta el precio de muchas de estas ropas accesorios ya que por lo general van de 2000 1 millon de dolares , por favor pongan algo mas accesible economico . tambien tiene articulos de interes para todos , ya sea de salud , relaciones , sexo , belleza , politica , cultura o decoracion , estos son variados algunos son muy buenos , otros aburridos , otros son superficiales o estupidos , otros son solo trivialidades . pero en definitiva esta revista es muy buena , pero eso si es muy elitista , esta hecha para mujeres con estilo propio , que tienen educacion de colegio o universidad , que se visten para ellas mismas no para los demas , diferencia de cosmo , glamour , marie claire que claman ser feministas en lugar de eso son antifeministas o pseudo feministas , elle si les da un buen lugar sus lectoras , en lugar de llenarles el cerebro con puro sexo tarugadas de como contentar tu hombre , amigo o lo que sea , convertirte en una barbie para el como dicen estas revistas que acabo de mencionar	1

when funds tight i difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions keep . each women magazine slightly different feel writing , though increased competition , these styles seem flux . i finally decided i preferred writing bazaar getting tired what i felt vogue cosmopolitan attempt catch larger readership ( if i want subscribe cosmo , i'll bloody well subscribe ) . featured designers more cutting edge less mainstream than what found vogue . it bit snottier ( though there far snottier magazines if you looking extreme fashions ) . among my complaints : bazaar obviously thinner magazine , while most vogue content adverts , it seem more articles . item i find highly irritating , bazaar society items . i really don't give ---- who wearing what what charity gala , especially when i don't play footsies these people . those complaints aside , this still my favorite fashion magazine	1
newsweek easy read interesting magazine . however , it not balanced economist or time magazine but come up some interesting articles developments worldwide . if you ignore conservative slant magazine , you enjoy coverage analysis various current world events . newsweek helps me keep up developments diverse range subjects including business society , international affairs , politics , arts other areas . i also appreciate its compact yet comprehensive nature . magazine helps put news into context . instance , i often frustrated during recent israeli-hezbollah conflict lebanon i could see news tv but not understand story behind news . however , after i read conflict newsweek , i got know background going back into decades i could now appreciate all news stories their proper context .	1

us weekly used cross people national enquirer - ever since new editor stepped ( it seems they new one every year ) magazine revamped . it looks more like classy people less like trash tabloid . i'm also little skeptical those who complain amazon.com doesn't deliver their magazines . not every business perfect , but i haven't problem my magazines delivered when i've ordered them amazon.com . it just makes me think all people whining just taking out their frustrations life amazon.com . maybe its why we see so many vicious jealous reviews , if you don't like your life change it . don't complain it , that how most people get where they today . anyway , unlike people , us weekly mainly focuses celebrities i think its price its far too short . least people thick . anyhow , celebrity junkie , us weekly must read . like reviewer , i too am tired reading jessica simpson brangelina . i think celebrity magazines tired this well . i'm starting see more diverse focus celebrities magazines . its certainly much better than reading touch life style weekly . although i like us weekly , i still think people best . people more classy , great layout , their focus 50/50 celebrities articles average folks . they great photos other interesting reads their magazine . even their website great , us weekly website looks like barbie website . recent changes great but if us weekly really wants compete people then it needs step up plate more . despite its faults , us weekly luscious read worth all its frothiness , so enjoy it .	1
(...) other magazines write similar topics outrageously priced their articles misleading you never learn anything actual relevance topics cover . one prime example this us weekly . i read several issues this past usually way someone giving mag me when they it i've actually only personally bought us weekly twice . but it style annoys me it magazine wants write interesting celebrity driven issues but often fails . please not confuse touch us weekly . what i sometimes think other people might easily dismiss touch like us especially since they sometimes feature same celebs right next each other newstands . touch keeps you " touch " celebrities their important/interesting stories happening week week their lives . but you don't feel like stalker or something reading this magazine i read other people comment us . touch always stays safe distance celebs personal lives not cross line their articles no matter who or what article written touch keeps up respectful tasteful point view subject/celebrity hand . they also talk important things public eye , such this weeks issue these few stories : people news section : cynthia nixon brand new life - this article talking how cynthia now found love happiness her life her lover woman . i no clue this till reading article . article just tells straight up facts , quote one cynthia friends saying " she totally love nothing hide . she two beautiful kids , money bank , incredible career , emmy career , now girlfriend . so cynthia , life couldn't better she wants share her happiness world ! " , nothing bad said article .. you tell , quite opposite . this way touch handles itself - it tells facts more happy things celebs lives less worse . but what i meant before it talks even no celeb issues this next story people news : * under survivors heading*montana plane crash miracle - man woman first presumed dead plane crash , but woman , jodee hogg managed free herself plane wreckage then free fellow parks co-work matthew ramige . they stayed anthor fellow passanger while he died then left get help walked two half miles - matthew broken back burns . it really amazing . kelly ripa advice working momsis joaquin still mourning his brother ? prince harry gets seriousmary kay defends her crimethere cover story . lo jennifer garner what . lo thinks " bennifer 2 " she still love ben . but even handled respectfully closest thing it gets sensationalizing it page entitled battle jens but it more fun than anything plainly obvious . here few more headings articles within mag - i think they pretty self explanatory so i'm just going list them : you friends your lover ex ? - three not crowd renee , jack his former wife , meg . fashion trauma - even celebs strike out , but these oops outfits saved ? why chip kim win $1 millionat home kelly osbourne - her pink paradisejerry favorite food stop - crossing jordan star jerry o'connel takes touch carney lathe 10 sexiest men season - it raining men this autumn , hollywood hunks strutting their stuff all over big small screens . what makes them best ? she plus-size model proud ! - america next top model toccara happy just way she . fatherhood changed my life ! - mark wahlberg talks his journey crotch grabbing bad boy devoted dadis tyra next oprah ? several more . i especially like section : it true ? - real story behind hottest gossip . you read this know what told truth . i noticed way more celebrities open up allow touch interviews tell them first hand facts than * other * magazines . also featured this issue article kevin costner wedding reception fair last weeks focused more his wedding this one more reception . it featured different pics/angles than last week so it not recycled material . katie wedding dream finally coming true ? - now her boyfriend divorce final , america favorite sweetheart free tie knot she couldn't happier !

while many mainstream publications shying away calling members current american government into account their transgressions - bribery theft misinformation cover-ups sexual escapades - " nation " its job reported facts . its trouble , many those who lean same way current administration lambast magazine " too liberal " " naively progressive .

this my favorite home/decorating/architecture magazine all time . perhaps it fortuitous coincidence , but " cottage living " always features homes areas country very interesting me - like adirondacks , boulder co , arlington va , asheville nc new orleans . editors good understanding cottage admirers their interests . therefore , they include floor plans , before after pictures , brief back-stories give us glimpse into life cottages their inhabitants . we get see cottages very different characters based their geographic region , their original purpose , style socioeconomic standing their owners . some homes really stretch definition cottage because their large size , but - usually - they convey spirit snug informal home anyway . we see cottage owners very ingenious using all interior space available . i love see how people used dormers , areas under staircase , other niches things activities would otherwise not practical because limited square footage . small space used wisely attractively challenge all cottage owners face . this magazine provides ideas galore . [ one thing puzzle annoy me magazine presence food articles . what living cottage - or wanting - anything type food anyone wants prepare ? i see no connection all . furthermore , recipes provided seem very labor ingredient intensive . i'd rather few more pages houses ! ] highly recommended !	1

like one commentor said ... " truth hurts " . it ... if you're happy your martha stewart scott peterson news , not buy this magazine . if you want real dirt , left or right wing ... this it . they shoot hip . if you want truth not what you see mainstream media , this magazine . they well known publish stories ny times afraid publish . matter fact , most writers mother jones nation used write times . i just heard last week two stories written ny times writers they're publishers wouldn't print . so guess who ? if you doubt me , look up 25 most censored stories 2004 2005	1
one american evangelicalism sympathetic critics once asked whether there such thing christian mind . all sorts reasons - some more than justified - questioners , skeptics , malnourished pilgrims produced negative responses query . but perhaps things better than all . if encouragement ma taken books culture : christian review , there hope kind wide-ranging integration faith intellect so routinely dismissed implausible cynical , misinformed those who yet discover intellectual renaissance among evangelicals populated university departments ( philosophy physics spring mind parade examples ) proponents robust biblical faith . publication christianity today empire , books culture provides forum some most incisive writing cutting-edge thinking found among christians anywhere . one not talking puff pieces cotton-candy testimony . rather , kind thoughtful self-critical engagement great conversation myriad contemporary issues one expects fat intellectual monthlies reviews new york london times offer here , abundance . this reviewer - who fights his wife possession issue sometimes finds them tucked away bedroom squirrel-holes which she believes him ignorant - watched this young-ish paper emerge something renegade among evangelical organs find its voice stride within just few years . its trajectory not far astonishing . christian century once known thought this quality still hits occasional home run . if it cans sustain its current run , books culture , looks rather . 325 hitter which franchise glory made	1
esquire may man magazine , but i enjoy articles woman , because it no holes barred feedback rough edges included . i got my first issue couple weeks back , found it funny , informative , great pic tom petty , i'm looking forward more issues	1
this original . if you looking man magazine insightful , thought provoking , entertaining , great buy , look no further . esquire around long time one reasons its great success it certain ' feel ' it transcends time . yet it right cutting edge today issues . magazines like maxim , stuff , fhm never class esquire because their appeal strictly ' shock-value . ' basically if you seen one them , you've seen them all . they offer nothing new , most content pretty crass . esquire , other hand entertains while making you think wide range issues . there always something esquire makes you want pick it up actually read what covers . yet it still its own unique style . subscription price huge bargain . you can't go wrong it	1

american photo much better magazine than its sibling popular photography , but frankly , not saying much . it seems though its primary market fashion/glamour photographers since most its issues devoted these aspects professional photography . there other magazines which excel nature photography , so i am not disappointed its absence here , but not noting more fine art documentary photograhy major omission which i hope this magazine address eventually . there also excellent photo equipment reviews frequently written working professionals , opposed solely in-house technical equipment overviews . american photo without question among better photo magazines currently available , but unless you interested mainly fashion glamour photography , you might wish look more closely shutterbug or other magazines devote nature fine art photography	1

health magazine publication gears its articles toward wide array health- related issues concerns . when i came across copy first time , i picked it up read degree skepticism . i thought it would magazine exclusively nutrition , but turned out not case . this magazine spend some time talking healthy eating habits , but this only tip iceberg when it comes this magazine . editors this publication talk all sorts health topics , like mental health , relationships , parenting , physical fitness , etc . because this , health something appeal almost anyone who reads it . this magazine divided into five main areas : beauty , body , fitness , mind , food . my personal favorites mind food sections . i like mind area best because it one where i usually find articles most relevant my own health concerns . here , you learn useful things like how reduce stress your work life , how deal problem children , other informative topics . lesser extent , i also like food section because it includes some very interesting recipes show how you spice up ordinary , routine meals little cost minimal effort . if there one thing criticize this publication , it would fact it primarily geared toward women . beauty section , example , focused almost entirely feminine concerns , advice makeup , eliminating wrinkles , etc . some these articles could , course , applied toward men but they mostly centered woman models used photos throughout most sections magazine female . flip side , however , my criticism prove asset women , many whom find this magazine very useful . still , spite this small criticism , health still very good magazine all read . remember- this not just nutrition magazine . importance vitamins , minerals , fats , proteins , carbs comprises only small part publication . remaining sections magazine feature some very useful articles mental health , relationships , disease control prevention , healthy cooking , etc ., making health good publication articles columns anyone relate .	1

i'm liberal , i've devoted reader tnr since 1950s . yes it liberal magazine . it excellent investigative work . i not noticed much change its politics past 50 years . some other readers mentioned tnr stand israel . this stand there since martin peretz took over magazine 1974 . peretz never supported right wing israel , but he certainly supported israel right exist . i remember one his early exposes time magazine its very one-sided reporting israel . this respect , tnr very different nation . but tnr support democratic candidates ? usually , but not exclusively . tnr not like dick nixon , course . after peretz took over , tnr supported carter president 1976 . next , i think it backed john anderson . carter foreign policy obviously started annoy tnr . tnr always backed clinton , gore , kerry . it backed kerry even though it little suspicious his attitudes israel . war iraq , tnr initially took colin powell his word weapons mass destruction reluctantly backed war this reason , after which it felt cheated . if you want left wing antizionist magazine , you won't want even read this . you'll want nation . if you want neoconservative magazine , you'll want read this , but magazine you'll really want weekly standard , or maybe commentary . anyway , i always read tnr , i highly recommend it everyone	1

after getting sample copy ( no , not because my illustrious career amazon reviewer -- if ) , i plans subscribe year or three . articles relevant , meaningful well-written , what more one ask ? i sometimes wonder if subscribed two science magazines overkill , but nah ... what all new discoveries shaping our world , it good idea keep abreast every little thing happening vulcan lab . scientific american more , well , scientific than discovery which tends more towards popular subjects such darwinism , under attack minority u.s. political sphere , but largely unquestioned scientific community . while i support discovery positions , they preaching choir far i am concerned , i not need persuading relevancy , veracity applicability darwin theories theories scientists who built even larger more fascinating structures based upon darwin . so if you're looking science lite , go discover , but if you're serious amateur scientist who already knows all basics , go scientific american , or if you're like me just can't get enough , go both , because both really good	1

although i'm casey democrat , meaning social conservative fiscal progressive , i enjoy weekly standard probably best neo-conservative magazine market . i find it timely , informative , provocative in-depth terms its coverage issues . i particularly like their " week review " feature , whereby they review events week provide some pointed commentary . but where i particularly came appreciate weekly standard debate over moral issues -- they offered innovative clear arguments favor traditional family values , using solid research up-to-date statistics numerous different disciplines , while avoiding usual worn rhetoric family values crowd ( among which i include myself casey democrat . )	1

when weird tales revived around 1988 , i sorely disappointed direction editorial staff taken . it too " progressive " not enough like old wt so many us afficionados knew loved . lin carter great thing going four paperback issues he came out under zebra imprint early 1980 . unfortunately , he not allowed continue . his idea keep flavor old weird tales alive , he it very well . then several years later comes schweitzer/scithers/betancourt wt , my goodness it sad see aura gone . gradually , though , wt seemed come put itself somewhat more direction " old-fashioned " ' zine it its heyday ( 1920's-1930 ) , although editor darrell schweitzer would probably disagree this observation . anyway , wt sports great covers now , good stories , good book reviews , interesting editorials . i must say i miss s.t. joshi always very entertaining book reviews , but we can't everything . scott connors ' forthcoming reviews surely entertain , douglas winter . all fantasy lovers should buy this magazine support cause fantastic literature , especially dark fantastic ; there so few outlets this kind now whispers weirdbook , not mention long gone forgotten fantasy , no longer published . good job , mr. schweitzer , whether you realize it or not , your magazine become more cozy , old-style , aesthetically pleasing magazine , more true tradition original weird tales , thanks no small part wonderful covers graced it last 13 or 14 years	1

this probably best magazine i subscribe . over past 5 years i've noticed quality my other subscribed videogame magazines deteriorated dramatically . but this one stays true . i thought now one would see drop quality , but quality writing just keeps getting stronger stronger . demo disc , example , continues stay chock demos most current even retro games . quality on-line reviews continues get better ! i love cd rom video tips , even enjoy just watching videos new upcoming games . other magazines , especially ones like gamepro , act like they give you demos , but this only magazine demo disc each ad every month . i even seen these demos sale auctions sites on-line ( including big one starts ) . i'm one those gamers rarely pays full price videogames , i appreciate able play demo some them , until i feel like paying them . amazon great site get used videogames cheap , i appreciate reviews helping me make decision buy game . hope this review helps somebody . mc white said : check it out !!	1
before buying subscription this magazine i would suggest reading through issue first , just so you aware what you'll getting . no , it not anything particularly challenging or mind-provoking , articles aren't scholarly or journal-worthy . but .. articles make subject accessible average reader , include insights into human behaviors relationships fun interesting . i am always engaged reading articles , find them topical very current , unlike some psychology magazines which too `deep ' drenched older principles . this very `hip ' psychology magazine would appreciated those who not necessarily scholars subject but who genuine interest learning more . my favorite part looking through recommended books section , because there usually something worthwhile read	1
very much lives up it name focusing pastalso present . free offer disc makes this cool . magazine some really good interviews well	1

i've subscribed bar least 6 years now , i enjoy mix articles holy land archeology related topics . current events reported informative useful . book reviews helpful guiding further reading field . i recommend it highly . my only complaint content would editor tends focus controversies press field perhaps merit less attention than he gives it . course , it seems self-serving his part keep beating drums , but it never dull . probably sells few extra copies evry month well . little background myself : ba degree anthropology , ordained elder presbyterian church , usa . i worked public school 20 years now .	1
i discovered this " magazine " while employed reference instructional librarian culinary college . four annual hardcover issues arrive just one ad - back cover . recipe quantities typically family size rather than mass serving quantities . this important note because this magazine very much oriented towards professional or very advanced amateur chef . profiles articles tend focus needs professional . one patron ( local sous chef who graduated different culinary school some years earlier ) began swearing blue streak after thumbing through few issues . when i confronted him outburst , he apologized explained his behavior . three years , he worked under local chef amazed creativity chef coming up new recipes restaurant . after thumbing through issues , my patron realized ugly truth - their entire menu cribbed art culinaire . when i told him i my disposal large stack subscription forms , he immediately took one saying , " next time , i'll ahead him . " each issue large enough beautiful enough double coffee table book ( paper quality pictures easily superior most cookbooks ) , but you want keep every sauce-splattered issue close stove you burning pages . there no other magazine compare it very few cookbooks match it	1

i rarely write reviews but couldn't believe what i read other reviewers , most whom focused how ritzy lifestyles parents depicted articles , how " expensive " clothes , how pretty moms ( models ) , etc ... this magazine . don't we expect some kind facade ? other " parenting " magazines may appear more " real " parents , but this no more than their chosen tactic . any publication whose foundational goal sell more advertising , they wouldn't doing this unless they believed it going work . they selling certain " lifestyle " just like child magazine . if it more accordance yours , fine . but why trash just because it different ? child magazine isn't perfect . but least it doesn't pander . anyone really want see what target latest attempt toddler fashion when they open magazine ? i'd rather just check myself next time i'm out buying diapers . if you value solid writing above all else magazine , then child magazine you .

we subscription 2001-2004 . last year subscription , magazine came focus more more politics , most political articles written conservative perspective or assuming neoconservative world view background . letters disagreeing anything robert kaplan wrote rarely , if ever , printed . ( though i know fact they received them ! ) we dropped our subscription picked up new yorker instead . conservatives however may want take new look this magazine . reviews suggesting it liberal must based pre-2003 reading . occasional issues we bought since dropping our subscription confirm conservative slant persisting . quality writing still reasonable however , it explores issues depth ( albeit one side )	1

this monthly magazine opinionated breath fresh air . it philosophically allied libertarianism , but it not extreme or strident . reason more mainstream moderate than left or right ; it really political common sense . i don't always agree articles , but i rarely object reasoning supports them . point view isn't beholden agendas or special interests , read reason .	1
reason cannot labeled conservative or leftist . nor it extremist libertarian magazine like liberty , fawning over ayn rand . it bases its commentary assumption , if we some faith , our chaotic culture lead somewhere good . but if we try monitor control it excessively , we dampen human creativity end up muddled conflicted . reason takes all aspects culture assumes international perspective . its arguments laid out carefully but contain percolating sense indignation our increasingly repressive environment . same time , they more informative than polemical ; each report grounded specifics - quotes , anecdotes , studies . this most intelligent inquiring " political " journal available . if only it came out more often	1
i love this magazine , images crisp , writing consistantly quality photography always fabulous . let face it when magazine coins phrase , you know it good . i read gq several years found it consistantly good , though i must confess only part i consider must read every month style guy , i don't always agree him , but i love questions , you really wonder if these people ever picked up magazine writing .. one never knows . clothes they feature usually top shelf , uh top shelf prices well .. i mean $2000 pair alligator lofers .. you gotta love it . if you any interest latest styles some great writing well , then i highly recommend this book you , though frankly i can't imagine anyone reading this not already opinion this iconic magazine .. but if you don't then all means pick it up form your own opinion .. it worth effort	1
finally magazine knows cottage . cottage isn't country , although it some those elements . it isn't necessarily small , but it . it doesn't necessarily mean old , though it . country modern hip or antique traditional . above all , it casual comfortable . it place you want come home . it feel , ambiance , flair putting things together don't come room-to-go packages furniture store decorators . i especially like various styles presented each issue -- ultra modern , traditional , log cabin , seaside , california contemporary , etc . monthly comparison styles one furniture grouping . it allows you grab ideas entire spectrum cottage style mix match yourself . i also like how easy how-to advice follow . paint advice luscious gardens interesting food , this magazine it all . accompanying website great . products paints easy find . i've banished all other decorating magazines my subscription list	1

far writing concerned this top notch rock magazine . format appealing pages not marred one too many ads . plus cd comes each issue ; this might help justify cost . original cd priceless real gems average music listener may not heard . they choose theme run it , creating eclectic mix artists illustrate their theme . take example few months back when it legendary tracks studio one jaimaca where it featured little known artists among reggae afficionados like ernest ranglin , michigan smiley next giants like bob marley , skatalites complete view important record label reggae . i really enjoy monthly features including tributes those passed away month entitled " real gone . " old rock stars going faster than they seventies ! other good features brief reviews music indexed filter reissues , reissues extra , tracks , buried treasure just plain filter albums(current stuff ) . depth articles cover subject very entertaining what actually drew me mojo intially information . there one draw back us subsrcibers , it long way acros pond problems occurr . last year my problems follows : receiving my issues two weeks after stores copies , missing cd . their credit both problems solved spite send three issues so i would finally get my ripped off cd , it stole twice ! subscriber beware . sending it clear plastic words cd inside just invitation thief . otherwise it maybe best rock music magazine out there i defintely recommend brits perspective	1
my head pulsates useless music trivia knowledge , most it reading magazines like " mojo . " let face it - brits market cornered quality music-centric publications right now this one , " classic rock , " " , " , occasionally , " uncut , " - but " mojo " editors need get over their obsessive compulsive infatuation beatles bob dylan , both whom influence importance grand scheme rock roll lore grossly overrated . live it ( let hate mail start rolling) ! minor caveat out way , " mojo " writing essence drive , simplicity , reverence its subject matter ( two words - ben edmonds ) , no small feat . their feature articles loaded facts information even i've never read before layout spot-on brilliant . how this innovation ? reviews section skimps neither quantity nor quality . while i can't pretend automatically snap up each issue " mojo " like i " classic rock , " i'm usually latest issue my newstand like dirt dog , evidenced stack back issues casa paull which now towers above all three my kids . if all this isn't enough , most issues come free sampler cd tunes least marginally related cover story - that called " gravy . " oh yeah , i almost forgot . it not half-full ads , like " rolling stone . " highly recommended .	1

health magazine publication gears its articles toward wide array health- related issues concerns . when i came across copy first time , i picked it up read degree skepticism . i thought it would magazine exclusively nutrition , but turned out not case . this magazine spend some time talking healthy eating habits , but this only tip iceberg when it comes this magazine . editors this publication talk all sorts health topics , like mental health , relationships , parenting , physical fitness , etc . because this , health something appeal almost anyone who reads it . this magazine divided into five main areas : beauty , body , fitness , mind , food . my personal favorites mind food sections . i like mind area best because it one where i usually find articles most relevant my own health concerns . here , you learn useful things like how reduce stress your work life , how deal problem children , other informative topics . lesser extent , i also like food section because it includes some very interesting recipes show how you spice up ordinary , routine meals little cost minimal effort . if there one thing criticize this publication , it would fact it primarily geared toward women . beauty section , example , focused almost entirely feminine concerns , advice makeup , eliminating wrinkles , etc . some these articles could , course , applied toward men but they mostly centered woman models used photos throughout most sections magazine female . flip side , however , my criticism prove asset women , many whom find this magazine very useful . still , spite this small criticism , health still very good magazine all read . remember- this not just nutrition magazine . importance vitamins , minerals , fats , proteins , carbs comprises only small part publication . remaining sections magazine feature some very useful articles mental health , relationships , disease control prevention , healthy cooking , etc ., making health good publication articles columns anyone relate .	1
there seems great deal psuedo business magazines . i like business week hard hitting , features excellent articles . i always several articles week this publication worth my time read . many publications dummy down business make it too simple leaving out important details , nuiances important , just assume reader isn't intelligent . articles written concise , generally filled data support their conclusions . i found this magazine invaluable business school because it kept me up date , often ahead my classmates . business world i find this magazine one few keep me informed well rounded aspects business i am not familiar . i really feel this worthwhile publication if you looking stay top what current important business world .	1
i loyal reader many years , i've always very impressed their insightful , deep investigations into various scandals national political events . they _always_ knew more than newspapers . they've just excellent , very well-written , i always felt like they could back up their opinions their open earnest political biases right 6th level abstraction , so speak . their pursuit objective truth , whether their target bush or dnc , earned my respect . new republic kept investigating muckracking while over last decade major news institutions one one become purveyors infotainment pre-digested pablum . my sense media consolidation various new press liability laws , news sources become air-tight we've getting our news company pr flacks lobbyist firms agendas . this environment real investigative work becomes like gold . middle-brow types read time , but writers time others who want real knowledge context what happening ground all read new republic . magazine vastly more influential than it 100k+ circulation # would imply . but .. new republic _for_ war iraq , despite their natural antipathy towards bush , which i share . i haven't read them lately - i'm sure they're appalled how things gone over there . magazine never cluster soft peaceniks usually associated left , but here i feel like they've let loose their inner hawks given bush benefit doubt ( always _wrong_ decision ) .. so what make them .. quasi-neocons ? utopians ? dupes ? they're often much too closely focused israel , this also may clouded their thinking .. colin powell great song-and-dance u.n. last year . i felt i needed try something new . lately i've reading new yorker reason ( it right-of-center doppelganger ) some other magazines , but i still think new republic excellent source news very worthwhile . definately - you should buy issue news stand try it out	1

no other magazine i'm aware gets more undeserved criticism than rollingstone . writing supurb . i don't know why everyone assumes pop culture magazines must all sensationalist rags same vein teen beat . complaining too many talentless teen icons put cover pointless -- it after all magazine delves into pop culture . not liking subject matter isn't just cause criticize . record review section best any music mag . it 100% idiotic assume their reviews bogus just because some band or group you wouldn't ever consider listening anyway got " good " rating . beauty their reviews they pander neither music elitists nor so-called " teeny-boppers , " their reviewers smart enough able differentiate what makes good pop music what makes good experimental music . rollingstone not specialty magazine that going say certain type music great type crap . it just music pop culture mag , damn good one	1

i live internationally reading economist every week since 1997 asian crisis it probably my most productive habit . i read it pretty much cover cover most weeks takes good 2-3 hours . i massacre it during week , roll it up , squeeze it into my handbag rip pages out take me any place i am potentially going bored . reading economist makes you smarter . i am not kidding or craven . it it : - improving your reading skills , reading makes you smarter . it uses language really well . it makes it easier you read harder things quicker comprehension . - affecting your writing style - you find their writing style stays your head affects way you write . - it introduces you wonderful books encourages reading through their references opinions - you eventually get around thinking ' i should really check book out see what fuss ' . discussions reviews economist got me reading adam smith , charles darwin proust among wide range others . you learn books like these learning makes you smarter . it puts daily news you get into context . i remember feeling total frustration during bosnian war . i saw news everyday - but i never understood overall story - what behind it ? you heard it historical " there always trouble balkans " like enough explaination kind horror . now , after almost 10 years reading economist , when i watch news i am more aware context - background story how these events might fit . it enjoyable read - absorbing occasionally very funny . there few things more geeky than bursting out laughing while reading economist - but unexpected laughter good thing ! christmas issue lots additional quirky articles - e.g. barbie torture small boys ( my brother ! ) . economist liberal proper sense it supports rights responsibilities individual , small government/low taxes , pragmatism . so you find it supports ; - legal safe contraception abortion . i am currently pregnant very aware given how hard it , it volunteers . - ending prohibition drugs consistent personal freedom , deal health issues , reduce source funding crime terrorism . - letting people own choice not choice majority , determine who they marry . - free trade most effective method poverty reduction world ever access . economist people who craving reality . it grownups .	1
i could not carry life i know it without economist . no hype . it good . this american reviewer became hopelessly addicted economist news analysis during four years england . magazine - or ' newspaper ' , it stubbornly insists calling itself - published london , though 2005 largest national readership united states . editorial line libertarian more moderate european sense word . essential values individual liberty , modest state , free market economics . don't let name fool you . this weekly far more than economist rag . its anonymous writing current events if fabulous , not mention top-ranked analysis letters , arts , like . let me give you concrete example how economist excels . years , i paid close attention its coverage latino immigration issues usa . one might suppose british magazine would disadvantage when exploring this complex topic , yet economist coverage routinely surpasses us newspapers magazines , perhaps largely because its disdain self-suppressing ' pc ' tactics . only area which i detect broad deficiency this magazine coverage role religion , particularly america . secularist european spectacles its editors wear seem make it impossible them canvass this phenomenon view religion continued fervor advanced western nations something other than retrograde slightly amusing . i tell my university-age nephews - thankfully , they ask - anchor their news consumption one weekly , then read widely beyond it . economist very best anchor available english-reading sailors	1

i subscribed details because i'm interested male psyche . i also like looking male celebrity pictures guy models ads . its not most politically correct article planet , one last page called " gay or ...? " which writer tries uncover if certain type person gay or not , no conclusion actually ever given so i suppose its reader decide . its very stereotypical part magazine , but beyond there cool articles read male perspectives . i also enjoy reading celebrity interviews , addition they include interviews female celebrities . i don't agree everything printed here , but certain articles made me think i've actually gotten lot out it . it helps me understand guys i agree certain opinions . mag leans toward liberal unabashed its attitude so . i like it lot , it may not everyone that fine .	1
man this it , great mag cool business people . what you not know , you after reading all this great info . read !!	1
although stories interviews strand well worth reading , i think it worth saying there not many stories per issue , , least case john mortimer rumpole stories , they taken forthcoming books . said , strand worth four stars i've given it , but i would describe it quot ; coffee-tablequot ; magazine , if such category exists , due its glossy pages , large size format , relatively low number stories interviews content	1
this first time i subscribed this magazine . i really like article topics but wish there more data included back articles .	1
this best magazine i've read lately . it still new , i've only received 4 issues , but read each cover cover , finding each article fascinating , very accessible ( unlike parent publication , which occasionally over my head . ) it may just because i like subject matter - but it seems me these subjects which would interest most people . some recent articles ( oct . 2005 ) included why we lie , meaning dreams , nature consciousness , what causes creativitity , what deja vu . it one subscription which well worth money . only drawback i've found it quarterly - sometimes it seems like long wait issues	1

where else you get magazine talks whatever it wants ? perspectives guys obsessed computers , technology , electronics , you get find out news just anything remotely relating these topics . political , scientific , hollywood , businesses , technology , i love it . i get read topics covered mainstream news sources , next page , what new japanese schoolgirls . i get such kick out it . i also love pseudo-geek talk they caricature . it kind stupid reviews all " wired " or " tired " but funny stupid way . buried enjoyable trash this magazine course , all many articles new electronics i love keep up . like popular science , only not lame . well , i like popsci , so i shouldn't make fun them .	1
i subscriber years grudgingly paid more more every year my subscription . still i always loved pw look forward my weekly edition ... although i not always receive my magazine timely manner . whether because i live west coast or if it just mail , i don't know . sometimes it arrives way into following week , sometimes closer beginning week . i still find magazine valuable , but say following : magazine directed publishing trade i find it ludicrous there so many typos reviews well text . who doing proof reading here ? there new format updated look , but i miss best seller lists back magazine . now they're somewhat middle one definitely can't just easily flip them . also , qa authors so stupidly placed issues which don't contain review author book who interviewed . instead , there reference date issue said book reviewed . it frustrating read qa then not able see review author book same issue . i guess publisher thinks people keep magazine least 4 weeks or issues just lie around house or office pile up . i like " deals " columm " hollywood reader " column , but my very favorite section author profile . i am curious tho age some writers this publication ... i'd also like know how magazine editors decide what book should get starred review . sometimes i'm astounded what gets starred . website , which you get full access when you register subscriber magazine , easy use . even before i receive my issue mail , i see latest issue line	1
fitness magazine ? uh , no i don't think so ... you get very good look their bodies though . i shocked see my local supermarket carrying this . it racy magazine without crossing " naked " barrier ( it puts fhm , maxim , et al shame , not just terms bare flesh - photography + writing better , too ) . conclusion , i say i wish this existed when i teenager - i wouldn't ride my bike miles across moors buy penthouse indians ( who couldn't tell how old i )	1

after getting sample copy ( no , not because my illustrious career amazon reviewer -- if ) , i plans subscribe year or three . articles relevant , meaningful well-written , what more one ask ? i sometimes wonder if subscribed two science magazines overkill , but nah ... what all new discoveries shaping our world , it good idea keep abreast every little thing happening vulcan lab . scientific american more , well , scientific than discovery which tends more towards popular subjects such darwinism , under attack minority u.s. political sphere , but largely unquestioned scientific community . while i support discovery positions , they preaching choir far i am concerned , i not need persuading relevancy , veracity applicability darwin theories theories scientists who built even larger more fascinating structures based upon darwin . so if you're looking science lite , go discover , but if you're serious amateur scientist who already knows all basics , go scientific american , or if you're like me just can't get enough , go both , because both really good	1
summary , this magazine portrays houses you can't possibly ever hope own " airbrushed " presentation can't possibly match real life ; it " house pornography " . it exciting read puts plenty ideas into your head . you determine whether repeated exposure this type media enhance your life or make you miserable . hey , if you spare million dollars need someone tell you what fashionable or good taste -- this you ! people complain ads -- i complain articles . people get way . i note none owners these showpiece homes children -- most living alternative lifestyles . actually , house becomes product relationship instead children . it fascinating cultural phenomenon this magazine leading journal movement .	1
people weekly american magazine celebrity human interest stories , magazine runs roughly mix celebrity human interest stories , people perhaps best known its yearly special issues naming " 50 most beautiful people " , " best worst dressed " , " sexiest man alive " . i think people magazine wonderful magazine because i keep touch what happy actors actress . what good movies good me watch . i think ya'll good job magazine . it worth reading every time i get it . people also includes reviews new books , cds movies .	1
i've reading glamour past three years it great magazine all around . glamour covers topics health , career , finances , sex , relationships , style , etc . all magazines newsstands , this one most intelligent savvy women their 20s 30s . yes there too many ads like most magazines , but that how media survives , they get their salary mostly ads . i usually don't mind because i feel its such great magazine , ads worth putting up . i felt times cosmopolitan little too focused sex " please your man " articles . glamour seems found nice balance i don't feel it dumbs down my intelligence all . i wish they would expand beyond typical articles . i wish they would include more sections culture , travel , technology . men magazines include articles gadgets tech , woman i enjoy gadgets well . its not just guy thing . its not perfect magazine , some issues better than others , but i feel this time glamour best magazine women right now .	1
after i bought glamour off news stand , i read it completely loved it . previous reviews little bit out date here amazon , my opinion , magazine transform dramatically year , if not less . there definitely lot less fluff lot wonderful articles 2005 . example , there articles emotional hardships mom whose kid mentally ill story up coming star happily adopted child . there articles women who struggled so girls today play little league , women get credit cards keep their job when they get pregnant . there lot important powerful article women rights dose celebrity life . my favorite article aisha tyler showing us how much digital touchup cover models .... it definitely made me feel lot better my body . i felt like glamour enough dosage fashion , health news , beauty tips , celebrity life , but still great job remind us greatness woman . i gave it 4 stars due fact i flip through 6 pages ads before i got table contents . i suppose that how magazines make their money , but i without . other than , great mag ! if every issues like one i read , i'd subscribe it heart beat .	1

i got subscription this magazine gift first glance , thought it going nothing but lightweight glossy fluff mainly meant push new products . fair , there plenty lightweight reviews new products each issue , but there also surprising number very useful , practical how-to articles -- mainly geared novice or intermediate digital photographers ( like me ! ) . yes , i've purchased big thick books photoshop before , but somehow , i never gotten far actually reading those books ( maybe too much info hobbiest who doesn't need/won't use 1/2 features product ? ) . i recently switched using photoshop using photoshop elements , this magazine seems nice compliment software package . recent issues , i've learned when how effectively use raw vs jpg , how take better advantage graduated nd filters , how use levels correctly , etc . contributing editors all top-rate photographs examples . i highly recommend anyone new digital slr and/or new pc image software such ps elements , get this magazine . it well worth subscription	1

i read this magazine off several years wanted add my 2 cents . yes , magazine many ads business opportunities . but this exactly something i want read evaluate , marketplace business opportunities . many these franchise opportunities , which exactly where first time entrepreneur should start . articles generally well written many obviously useful , but not all . value each article often depends where you business creation process . it not until i read e-myth revisited i understood value these franchises . this magazine slices dices franchises many metrics help you find one where you most likely both succeed happy . magazine easily worth more than price any person seriously starting or building small enterprise . hope this helpful entrepreneurs out there	1

i chose subscribe this mag over men health . my reasons simple- though both offer same interesting articles interest men , best life less " racy/edgy " content 30 something father 4 may not comfortable reading or leaving around house curious eyes see . it seemed geared more toward my demographic , opposed mens health seemed more geared single bachelor living " la vida loca " . one thing i prefered mens health plethora health/nutrition info each issue . this one area they excel providing wealth nutrition info many recipes complement healthy lifestyle . best life also nutrition info but nowhere near much . my decision based couple issues evaluation . hoping they stand up months come .	1

several times past i've almost completely given up motor trend . i even canceled my subscription two occasions . my main gripe during those times ? too darned many trucks suvs . sure , that what u.s. public seems want , " trend " appear name , but boooooring . when they released truck trend sister publication , i danced joy then fell flat my face when mt seemed still spend 2/3 every issue hulking boringmobiles . recent months motor trend come full circle again seems focusing interesting articles cars . trucks suvs hardly missing , but respect others mt tremendously better than it , say , two years ago . transformation nearly astounding . i still remember first time i closed back flap latest issue suddenly thought " holy smokes , good ! " now definitely worth reading again	1

i take several different magazines , different types . this one i invariably read cover cover , every single issue . ok , so you _interested_ specialized subject matter , first . but if you any interest all aviation history , this magazine presents seldom-failing insight into lost , little-known , obscure aspects entire century aviation . writing literate interesting , they come up some marvellous , mostly unpublished , pictures . i would recommend least trial subscription - my bet you'll like it	1
guy loves outdoors all wonders it provides , " outside " magazine him . filled straightforward info travel , workout health tips , those little gadgets make outdoor activities easier tackle , this publication hits nail head . i would've never discovered it if it hadn't offered one perks renewing my subscription magazine readers ' service , , i am grateful	1
magazine really great . before i started reading flaunt i read surface * wallpaper . flaunt more pop culture articles i find more interesting than those other magazines which seem like they just made rich people . good thing they avoid too many articles europe quot ; spring break-likequot ; travel articles which reused other magazines over-and-over . good magazine read architectual record . quot ; onequot ; really good magazine like flaunt , i don't even know if its still published anymore	1
i've looking good outdoor magazine some time . most focus hunting or fishing , while there nothing wrong , i just don't those things very much anymore . some , like outside , become political rags written people who know virtually nothing outdoors . backpacker , however , focuses hiking camping like it should . skills survival issues priceless . sometimes they go overboard gear reviews , but many also valuable , better than one i read adventure magazine ( if you spending hundreds dollars jeans hiking , something wrong you ) . there many good articles people places hiking camping world . great resource hikers , geocachers , campers climbers .	1
backpacker rare thing periodical market : magazine never weak issue . i subscribed backpacker year now . it only gotten better time -- truly going strength strength . if you love outdoors , this magazine you . your level experience things like hiking , camping , rock-climbing , snowshoeing , canoeing , kayaking , yes -- backpacking , not issue . this magazine consistently something people all levels . my debt these pages great indeed : i learned some skills honed others . i discovered ( visited ) some places i not know existed . it backpacker i tipped off beans roosevelt lodge ( this alone worth price subscription ) . i love : reader choice awards , gear guide issue , work-out plan last year spring hiking issue , stories/feautures . i didn't think they made magazines like this anymore . i wrong . backpacker excellent publication . i give it my highest recommendation . get copy today .	1
it cool but kind short . it should longer	1
i really want like this magazine . one , cover almost so pretty comforting , plus they cover many aspects may concern vegetarian lifestyle , such environment , health , politics , etc . however , recipes inconsistent . some , like readers ' best , excellent . many their other recipes fall short though , some glaring oversight ( example , forgetting salt ) . also , their ' ethnic ' recipes usually aren't great . their preoccupation lowfat recipe also unfortunately lead sacrific taste . seriously anyone think pam healthier than olive oil ?? vt really best when it focuses american classics vegetarian . things like chilis , pot pies , casseroles . i still give this 4 stars because i think except recipes , magazine isn't all bad , plus there aren't many other competitors this market . their cs very friendly when i called . if you aren't picky i am getting exact recipes right , then this nice magazine . me , once my subscription stops , i'm switching buying time-tested recipes books instead .	1
i think popstar great magazine teens . it positive ! not like other celebrity teen mags out there . it up-to-date music , movies tv celebrities .	1
popstar ! my favorite magazine long time because every single issue , i end up finding pictures articles every star i am interested , also some newcomers . they always good words pictures lindsay lohan , hilary duff , ashton kutcher , chad michael murray , justin timberlake , raven , jessica simpson , avril lavigne , aaron carter , britney spears , good charlotte , simple plan , adam brody , olsen twins , jesse mccartney , greg raposo , orlando bloom , usher , harry potter cast ... i could go . my room half devoted their cool pinups posters . they good fashion stuff , funny pictures , fun games ... big shout-out my aunt subscribing me four years ago . i just love this magazine . i don't like other celebrity magazines because they're more racy less quot ; stuffquot ; lol . i would say this my #1 favorite magazine . i also like cosmogirl ! i sort like gl . thank you opportunity express myself . if you're reading this , chad , you rock	1
i bought issue check out groceries store . i made five recipes same issue during weekend , i loved everything . yes , there some suggestions use store bought daugh , pudding mix , whip cream , etc . but you easily substitute daugh your own . food tastes great looks fantastic . some tortes sandwiches really innovative . i certainly subscribe it .	1
this fine magazine cross wired , american woodworker , popular mechanics scientific american . each issue features four very detailed diy projects , short descriptions general guides few others . combined diy info , there usual mix opinion articles , political commentary , news summaries , letters , articles crazy diy-folk , etc . four " core " diy projects each issue include step-by-step instructions , full parts lists extensive photos ( or screenshots ) . all parts lists also include sources , which important age where parts department radio shack just isn't what it used . projects featured each issue usually funky , weird , stuff only tiny fraction readers actually build . reviewer said , most projects simply not useful . however , just because projects aren't exactly useful doesn't mean they aren't cool . i ever build timed cat feeder powered castoff vcr recycled hand-crank meat grinder ? no . i think idea recycling motors control circuits such thing neat ? course , any " real " geek would agree . most electronic projects assume basic soldering skills ( introduction soldering available vol 1 ) , most computer projects natrually involve more skill than just booting machine . outside " core " projects each issue , " diy " section features bunch abbreviated project summaries , expectation you scrounge some your own parts , able read schematic diagram . geeky friend could probably help you out those if you over your head . yes , this magazine expensive . $34.95 /yr four issues sounds like lot . however , ads far less intrusive than they would cheaper magazine , articles better written , make it suitable use actual workshop , it printed sturdy bond paper bound cardstock cover . any magazine , some issues some articles better than others , but whole , quality magazine quite high . many said most tutorials magazine found web various forms , scattered . completely true . nevertheless , it convenient information fairly well-tested magazine added advantage paper . summary , if sort topics covered make interest you , i know no other magazine market better	1
i say i bit disappointed first two issues ... entertained , but not enthralled . nevertheless , this mag tons potential . i expect some near-misses when truly creative endeavor steps outside " formula . " happily , they've come into their own issue three ! ( , after they replaced my usps-mangled copy . record , they so quickly ) . this mag produced o'reilly empire geekytechnohack books which well regarded tech trenches . unique exciting concept here harnessing largely computer-based hacking ethos challenging its exclusively " virtual " focus . safety warning : pale , overcaffeinated hackers must use sunscreen when they step outside fresh look non-virtual world ! this not cheapest subscription shelf ( only four issues/yr ) , but these mags stuffed content , keep you busy weeks casual reading . i personally believe quarterly format makes sense . these not kind topics i want see large/slim format " throwaway " package . i expect these magazines stay shelf future reference . end , editors would well create cumulative topic index each issue . ( consumer reports familiar example ) . overall , highly recommended	1
sea health fitness magazines out there , it hard find ones really give interesting motivational information . muscle fitness , musclemag , flex , all good their own reserve , but targeting juiced up group bodybuilders . men health , men fitness like kind bore their long winded articles ( my experience ) lack any real fitness material . fitnessrx men , other hand , gives person into fitness actual fitness info normal guy . i think fitnessrx men fairly new , possibly year or two into publication format may changed since i first viewed it ( unimpressed ) . information good , thends focus practically any area men life health ( although i admit i note some recylcled info most current issue ) . print quality great well , glossy , very detailed well taken photography workout routines . this fitness magazine i've waiting . excellent photography both motivates , demonstrates workout without putting model some rediculously small pair workout trunks ( men workout ) . i suggest guy who subscribes , or purchases male health magazines pick up issue look over home , or least flip-through magazine aisle	1

i just reviewed burda moden , much what i said there applies here too . first off , i'm plus size lady . i sew , i love burda magazines . till recently i annual subscription i need refresh my subscription again . i always but always subscribed both regular magazine ( which plus size section ! ) plus magazine ( which never duplicates what you see regular one ) . if given choice i think i'd take plus magazine if i couldn't afford both . here some helpful tips why you might like subscribe even if you don't sew , how so if you out states area . canadians there burda magazine reseller , it cost 10$ canadian per issue . which much less than normal pattern now . so it saves you patterns . burda ways subscribe each country , just go their website click till you get reseller your own area . why burda best ! fashions presented 2 years ahead . i found styles presented burda year ahead hitting stores retail , 2 3 years ahead other major pattern companies , 1 year ahead burda pattern envelopes sold fabric stores . even if all you look upcoming styles never sew stitch you find this magazine useful keep ahead trend curves . this what european ladies wearing . all clothing well put together , showing current trends ( future trends north america ! ) europe shoes , purses , jewelry , colour choices more . they use fashion forward textiles make garments photos clear enough you get trim detail figure out fabric your local store . if you sew , this magazine keep you wasting money outdated expensive paper patterns keep you front end fashion . after all if you go trouble sewing , fitting it nice if you wear something few extra years look up date while doing so . plus size lady , i found it refreshing surprise find patterns actually looked stylish ahead ready wear regular market let alone nightmare retail plus size ready wear . each magazine comes all patterns make all clothing featured . look thru , see what you like trace off your own pattern . note sizes -- burda fits much closer than normal pattern companies which makes much nicer fit , but you may find yourself needing go up size or two . measure carefully , try cutting one size up till you get used fit . don't cut into expensive fabric till you used how they fit . make few cheaper garments first . armholes crotch area fit differently than north american clothes . aware above size 20/22 north american sizes , won't fit into these plus sizes . their idea plus 14-20/22 . if you bigger it fairly easy size patterns up bit , but you need some experience sewing pattern alterations well . ( learning how , check out sandra betzina stuff altering patterns)here couple helpful hints dealing tracing off patterns centerfold . i used waxed paper usual kitchen type roll traced sharpie marker pen . why wax paper ? it cheap , you see thru it , you fuse it into bigger sheets needed . fusing wax paper : take warm iron , press thru paper towel so you don't get wax paper your iron . ( when you finish , run your iron over clean terry facecloth absorb any wax seeped out ) . when fusing , hold till wax paper clings it look bit " bubbly " . edited add : use highlighter pen mark lines you tracing off . it help you " see " correct pattern peice correct size spaghetti trail master pattern centerfold . tracing : burda patterns don't come seam allowance so i added after tracing my patterns . using sharpie straight edge long runs i traced off my desired size patterns which look like multicoloured spaghetti lines all over newsprint center . then add seam allowances before cutting out your wax paper pattern ! all those lines . here where my wax paper tip comes handy . i've tried tracing paper , even interfacing but multiple lines burda magazine pattern too much those usual tracing papers or interfacing . you need something much more see thru . wax paper ! cheap , almost transparent , sturdy won't bleed sharpie marker ink . burda doesn't print one sided pattern masters so you trace . you can't just sacrifice rest patterns cut yourself one only since other peices likely printed back . remember add your seam allowance !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! once i cut out my pattern ( write all notes what size , layout , darts etc pattern ) i put my pattern pieces manila envelope . pattern envelopes home made patterns work best some labelling . i put magazine ( fall winter 05 ) page # ( 34 ) model i'm copying size , yardage i require any sewing notions or extras ( zippers , interfacing , 17 buttons , yada yada)maybe due bit obsessive such things i sketch line drawing envelope note saying , skirt , pants , jacket or whatever garment . my drawing isn't perfect but i try include front back view major seams darts drawn . it useful . i keep them normal household file folder , since manila envelopes fit perfectly . file under jacket , dress , skirt etc . or year . there , i hope helps . this well worth getting even if you never sew single stitch magazine .	1

i'm huge military history buff i'm glad see these history magazines popping up next penthouses playboys news stands . essentially , it good magazine , describing vividly often over-looked aspects war shaped us all . i especially like articles like one american canadian 1st division , who landed them juno beach ( yes , juno beach ) . only complaint i it concentrates too much ' american effort ' war . yes , america contribute , but undoubtedly bulk credit must go soviets . they meat grinder swallowed all german elite units 1942-43 so normandy , most amphibious assualt groups making contact 3rd line conscripts slave soldiers . yes , some crack units faught against western allies , good example afrika corps , paratroopers , some ss units , etc , but really , it soviet juggernaut msot prominent . i hate other reviewer said russian soldiers far worse than landers . now , you commiting same sin one you preaching against ! don't generalize millions russian soldiers served died into ' rapists sinners ' category , because some them commit atrocities . also , average russian soldier forced nkvd charge german positions , often without any weapons , gunpoint . retribution later war years inevitable , but course not acceptable . but heroism , stamina , lethality average russian soldier , only ' secret weapon ' army , especially early years , should not overlooked	1
i'm velonews subscriber , happy one . it bit pricey , but worth it . it tough beat race coverage -- these folks cover all significant road racing united states , well cyclocross racing bit mountain bike racing too . this review , i'll put velonews into context review other cycling rags . velonews , writing editing quite good -- articles tight gripping . i find myself tad lost finer details us racing . when they're reporting some cyclocross race new england , example , i don't know single rider . velonews essentially lavishing coverage cycling " minor leagues . " velonews militantly sticks racing -- they don't gush over celebrities . if they gush over anything , it $5000 carbon fiber race bikes most us would never consider buying . velonews written avid bike racing audience , not just people who know what " peloton " . i'd say velonews just bit aloof -- stubbornly addressed hard-core cycling fans amateur racers . it if they won't talk those us shimano 105 our bikes or admit some us like read cycling celebs novice repair tips . velonews most comprehensive source news american racing , bar none . myself , i tend prefer grander competition european racing , where very best compete age-old races . i've come learn us racing , but times i feel bit more drawn cyclesport , which really just looks euro racing . latter mag more celebrity oriented glossy , pretty much ignores us race scene . also , it only comes out monthly , so " news " really old !! velonews comes out bi-weekly , so it really stays current . this major , major difference . bicycling magazine pays almost no attention racing , instead gives recreational rider her due . bicycling you get tips nutrition , training , repairs , commuting . i currently subscribe all three . bicycling magazine must me , because it very well , focuses amateurs , so cheap . racing news , i might end up going cyclesport because my preference euro road racing . i don't any touring , but my friends who just * adore * adventure cyclist , which part great non-profit cycling advocacy organization . sum , velonews you if you're . ) hard-core fan bike racing , particularly road racing ; . ) most interested north american racing ( though they very good coverage giro , tour de france , many other euro races ) . fans sport , velonews good it gets	1

oh those days , when i college , reading my first issues then subscribing . there great things found its pages , columns brian crozier , russell kirk , erik von kuenhelt-leddhin ( sp ? ) . great struggle soviet union going into critical stage . it seemed nr so right track . it wonderful read , least 1979 1983 . but then it became while duller . it some periods recrudescence , such under editorship john o'sullivan . but when rich lowry took over nr really began dumb down ( nothing personal mr. lowry ) . but what i've really discovered late how badly neo-con agenda sort taken over magazine . we've got 50th anniversary issue call midge dector rally country our illegal immoral war iraq . really something happened magazine , sinister force entrenched itself there . what force ? well , go come-and-hear.com you begin learn part picture , especially when you read material elizabeth dilling . i would also recommend paul findley they dare speak out , which details israeli lobby domination our congress . nr once courageous conservative magazine , but now it heavily tainted influence terrible thing . wfb should know better , maybe he . if he doesn't , then he should pick up neo-conned ! neo-conned again !, then he should listen tony martin talk given ihr certain group tactics deployed suppress free speech . what inspired me write this review wfb recent column incarceration david irving . it ends disgusting gloating . wfb fallen into evil trap , so magazine he used run . what happened christian faith people like buckley ? he now seems lost terribly afraid offending supposedly saintly interest group ... you , mr. lowry , come now : read widely deeply don't afraid reading talmud israeli lobby . once you , maybe you'll develop strength think outside box . we're going if we want anything but bleakest future mankind planet .	1
this magazine just dares people pick most boring , pretentious , or ostentatious feature within any given issue . " town country " extremely old money venture , while it some good useful articles ( lovely advertisements things virtually nobody afford , ) much magazine essentially centered very elitist worldview grows very tiresome rather quickly . " town country " initially recommended me because ostensibly good coverage travel architecture , two areas i great interest . applicable aside , when i read list tips offshoot " town country travel " publication ways ease stress long range flights , i realized there reality check due when one first tips always fly first class , ignoring fact vast majority readers would rather buy car what typical first class ticket europe or asia costs . i mentioned , there some good articles , there occasionally better more useful offshoot publications like " town country travel " eminently more readable ( although they still insist advertising things like seven million dollar vacation homes coast , etc . ) i say photography always good , you believe if it appears here it finest most fashionable available : hyacinth bucket would , no doubt , like seen reading this magazine . despite occasionally worthwhile features , i find " town country " excessively pompous , therefore i recommend finding publication focused whatever area interest you , whether it fashion , society , or travel .	1

first off , i usually just stick rating critiquing movies . but , every time i see ad this website this time/warner ( or whatever hell company calls itself this week ) rag-mag i start see red . " entertainment weekly " , which once interesting weekly deluge ho-hum everyday life , become just rag crapped out weekly stand newstands week after week prostituting your hard earned cash . back summer 89 , " ew " released after i read few issues , i decided subscribe . i instantly hooked ( new issue would arrive my mailbox saturday before it would hit regular newstands ) i liked getting latest news reviews movies , music , t.v. , video ( later added mid-90 ) . problem magazine started late 90 . i started notice " ew " would cover big movie or event hadn't yet released then following week bash hell out it , or try get some piece dirt it order generate more sales . i also hate damn lists " ew " comes up . latest entitled " top 100 most memorable movie lines " joke . these lists always annoyed me , because i feel they truly not thought out therefore not thought provoking . other most important thing i noticed absolute lack honest review . case point , few weeks ago i picked up latest issue which movie " catwoman " reviewed ( i wasn't sure if it gleiberman or shwarzbaum critiqued it ) . i first logged onto " rotten tomatoes.com " see what percentile " catwoman " recieved nation critics . out roughly 115 reviews " catwoman " only got 10% good reviews while rest trashed it ( film needs , least , get grade 60 - 65% order place it fresh or good movie ) . makes " catwoman " worst reviewed film , so far , 2004 . yet , " ew " gave film . what erkes me even more " catwoman " released " warner bros . " , same company owns rights " harry potter " films , " lord rings " trilogy , yes , " wb " owns " entertainment weekly " . " warner bros . " trying bribe or threaten its own critics one its most popular lucrative magazine ? i'm not only who seen this developement . people written saying there favoritism among " warner " products reviewed magazine . " ew " , course , hotly denies anything kind thumping there chests standing behind there reviews , possibly fear fired ( they deny also ) . my only question reviewers " entertainment weekly " , " whats it like stand your own pile bull**it ? " or better yet , " what it like stand democratic podium ? "	-1
i subscribed modern bride gift my fiance . aside not receiving our first issue until 3 months after subscription , i only received 3 issues total . months went without anything delivered . while customer service modern bride very accomodating helpful , nothing happens immediately . when planning wedding , each every month precious . especially during initial stages wedding planning . finally gotten this subscription problem under control exhausting . plus , this time most wedding details finalized , magazines i received became useless . if you're under 12 months your wedding date , you should strongly consider if now good time begin subscription modern bride	1

when you watch commercial children television , you accept commercials because , after all , programs " free " . but when you pay subscribe nickelodeon magazine , i don't expect it so so full alluring ads targeting children . these ads appear similar editorial content . it seems like 50% pages advertisements ! i disappointed won't renewing our subscription . better look something highlights magazine series .	1
like " where waldo " , it seems every issue must least one , if not several mies van der rohe daybeds . while this admitedly classic piece furniture , one gets impression there gaggle designers telling their clients , " you one these , they're what ! " most features metropolitan home suffer same fate ; dreary antiseptic homes same dreary interiors obviously foisted upon gullible , uninformed clients designers who know how make easy buck . " modern " equals , course , mies van der rohe daybed ( notice how many times it shows up this review ? ) , otherwise you get month after month 1970 florals , faux louis whatever tables . even using feature extraction , wading through dreck finding something useable your own purposes , it painful look through this magazine . if you really want ideas making your house reflect you , trust yourself what you like , if you like mies van der rohe daybeds , all means get one . just don't plunk one your sun room because you told it trendy . if you like modern style , look up works hans wegner peter hvidt go there ; their furniture still looks stylish after 50 years hard use real families sturdy well . maybe you want house where nobody allowed set foot any rooms amounts bad hodge-podge styles all seem bit busy bumpy . everyone else , think things you'd like see if you walked into room , save your money skip this magazine	-1
i echo same gripe other reviewers voiced here : magazine covers same handful people week after week after boring week . how many times reader going see no talents such jessica simpson , lindsay lohan , tom cruise-katie holmes joke , most overrated , overhyped people all time brad pitt angelina jolie cover not get tired it ? it nice know what going certain celebrities once while but every single week ? you say " overkill ? " i'm glad i never got subscription this magazine . i picked it up every once while newsstand but stopped because i so sick tired reading overrated , overhyped glorified b-movie " actors " " actresses " who lucky one successful movie haven't anything value since . i picked up copy today sworn it off forever . don't waste your time or your money . - donna di giacom	1
laptop mag best described negatively : it not really serious computer magazine . it more or less like consumer guide , which basically paid advertising . this means you can't really trust article here because you don't know if they not written unbiased writers . end , i feel this waste money . besides , you get all info free web , cnet or zdnet , anyway	-1

i subscribed late may maximumpc pcgamer . early july i started getting pcgamer . still nothing maximumpc . i called customer service they said they recieved my order june 2nd expect my first issue late september . thats nearly four months ! unreasonable wait relative industry standard clearly outside stated wait order form . i gave one star because magazine good magazine . but $8.99 news stand price it too expensive ... so i am left choice spending almost $35 get four months worth before my subscription starts ( more than subscription itself ) or just missing out those issue . very poor customer service .	-1
liked this magazine enough order it but it gets one star wasting my money . thought it'd simple enough order it amazon like i everything else . but instead i've paid never received it . i haven't able log compaint amazon cause every time i it links me somewhere else , so this first chance i've even say i've ripped off . they may eventually send it but it not likely this point , it couple months now	-1

i read rolling stone music those who make it , not some guilt ridden , agenda blasting editorial team feels their politics ( guilt so much establishment they wish they could hate ) something we should all read nauseum . when they stick music , it good , when they parade their shreiking political views , it boring .	1
i subscriber 15 years still enjoy magazine . no , its not best magazine music , but it one best general pop culture news i still occassionally find new artists because magazine , though i tend find more new movies now . however , if you ever problem customer service , forget it . i never got my copy 1,000 issue , when i asked replacement , i told they out issue , but would extend my subscription one issue . i pointed out it double issue they still selling back issues their web site $20 . if they don't resolve it quick , i might just cancel my subscription , i'm so disgusted .	-1
our library just finished its magazine usage count , my surprise american spectator came dribbling only couple hits , measured current copies left table check outs older issues . yet our patronage here very conservative . perhaps people who once read this sort thing no longer read all , or maybe , couple reviewers suggested , bill clinton out office , it no longer same appeal . you change my rating five stars if you like , sake ideology , but you still won't read thing . just like i don't read nation anymore	-1
i've loyal subscriber since 1998 always enjoyed magazine . something happened them early 2006 - they've either bought or hired new editor / staff or something . this magazine absolutely terrible now . all ads , fewer fewer pictures babes each issue , hilarious articles now long gone . my last two issues ( sept oct ) trash within minutes pulling them my mailbox . i'm canceling my subscription .	-1
i certainly hope one these days maxim magazing get women who small-breasted equal time . that all i say	1
i ordered this magazine without really knowing anything it . i very disappointed . not enough recipes . recipes included not really ones i would use .	1
some strange reason , i began receiving this magazine mail . never ordered . never paid . my conclusion based reading last three issues : you're kidding me . how time inc . still publish this rag ? what point	-1
wasn't worth subscription . i found magazine bland , full ads basically boring . all information found doing quick web search . highly disappointed	1
nice cover pictures headlines , but way too many ads . there reason its only twelve bucks , this ad-sponsored mag	1
this definitely magazine gearheads . it pretty much just equipment reviews advertisements . i would given it higher rating but two things : 1 ) i don't think i've ever seen popular photography not love any piece equipment . reviews still useful if you're just wondering what features new gizmo , but still , they ought bit more critical if they're going such review based magazine . 2 ) many ads vendors bad reputations . i believe they make some sort claim requiring certain level honesty anyone they sell ad space , but it sure doesn't look like they ever kicked anyone out magazine me . so what you when you magazine full uncritical reviews , occasional beginnerish article technique , lot ads stores dubious virtue ? best 2 star magazine	1
i cannot review this item because month later , i still not received first issue my subscription . sorryfrank caldero	-1
while waiting my daughter orthodontic office last month ( july 2005 ) , i read through what i thought would familiar redbook magazine past . instead , i shocked come across new sexual advice section which explicit techniques giving your man satisfying oral sex without tiring yourself out described . article within this section explained how taller man sex shorter female partner while both standing . i felt embarrassed outraged this magazine out tables waiting room any age group read . i am age 48 , college educated mother 2 teenagers . i would not want my 13 year-old daughter consider this light reading or helpful advice , nor i think it appropriate magazine such redbook . parents please seriously consider whether you want this magazine end tables your homes . it changed	-1

legend goes there time few decades ago when " gramophone " unquestioned authority reviews recordings classical music . whether or not legend true ( i'm too young know ) , gramophone time definitely passed . today there multitude sources free information classical music internet , newsgroups websites . some it less well-informed than gramophone criticism , but some it more well-informed . what undeniable , price few mouse-clicks , it possible find far greater range reviews recordings internet than gramophone ( its british-based critics ) offer . what more , gramophone tied business-model classical music industry fast becoming obsolete . historically , most important classical recordings issued few so-called " major " companies such emi , deutsche grammophon cbs ( later sony ) . these " majors " would buy lavish advertising spreads gramophone so finance magazine . return , gramophone would devote lengthy reviews majors ' new releases would produce pages fluffy interviews musicians under contract majors . today situation different . most interesting new release more likely appear mp3 obscure russian website than new cd sony . small companies , dedicated solely classical music recordings , produce great results shoestring budgets while " major " corporations virtually abandoned new classical recordings . this development causes problems gramophone business model . new players classical music industry don't publicity budgets fund glossy magazine like gramophone through advertising . gramophone implicit bargain : " advertise us or we won't review your recordings " , magazine seems becoming more more irrelevant . if you want subscribe classical music periodical , i recommend " international record review " or " fanfare " . both offer substantially more reviews per month than gramophone . but most all , i suggest checking out huge range classical music information available free web usenet	1
i hate this magazine . i subscribed sight-unseen based good reviews , find recipes food no one my house would ever eat ... way too exotic . if you like good ol ' american fare , don't buy this one	-1
i charter subscriber this magazine when it started up publication . it breath fresh air stagnant field almost universally wretched photography magazines . over years things changed . columnists died or moved . editorial directions switched . articles once inspired now only offered consumerist bullfeathers . when digital photography became dominant marketplace , " outdoor photographer " vanguard , pushing every gadget photoshop manipulation plug-in popped up . magazine became wasteland promises better pictures if you just buy _____ ( fill blank whatever current trend might ) . what i thought ironic time best photographs they printed photographers using least sophisticated equipment . photographers using film (!?) , lot large format guys , occasionally some black white stuff made cameras just any serious hobbist already owned . but these portfolios began dwindle occasional rare almost non-existent . some point , my interest this garbage lapsed before my subscription . magazine made once monthly trip mailbox trashcan without even opening it until they finally stopped sending it . " outdoor photographer " impresses people who measure quality photography whether or not equipment used production cost equivalent gross national product small third world countries . it offers little way nutrition hungry mind . it empty calories , just making you want more more while starving your potential . it truly wretched .	-1
i told this magazine good look design ideas . it isn't really , there isn't really much this magazine . it just tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked august september issues only things those two impressed me features elton john out africa fundraiser article julian mcmahon . rest it ads , not classy type ads make advertising tolerable vogue magazine , but same old ads you'll see anywhere else , they annoying . there several nonsense fashion articles likes kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one my professors would call it " plastic person syndrome " ) mark consuelos , waay too much jennifer garner her baby , other weird things , such trend designer cupcakes . i wish i kidding latter , but i am not , nor i $25 spend glorified cupcake just because it jessica alba favorite . there entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because stars it way here . despite size this magazine , there very little sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos same old same old , tips mimicking them . i am not interested becoming teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested seeing vanessa carlton pad . this magazine you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , subscription actually not year ( it says special issues count regular issues magazine ) your life ambition try cupcake bakery new york because some celebrity . this magazine mediocre best , worst part , it exact same fashion advice vogue . i went vogue because there substance their magazine , ads classy very chic . leave this one behind-it looks me like brain fluff read folks aol time warner .	1

i very disappointed this magazine . tech reviews absolutely no depth them . most articles rather pretentious boring . 5 issues i received so far only may 2006 issue any thing interesting . it only two articles which worth it . first " robbed blind " which rfid chips second article " diy ways go green "	-1

i began subscribing gourmet 1961 , continued subscribe forty years . i also gifted family members subscriprions . i discontinued my subscription because magazine deteriorated so much last several years : there so many ads tear-outs magazine one hardly find recipes , least half magazine , sometimes more ; also i object " political , " some downright offensive , articles . i am catholic , i very offended outrageous article charging , during nazi era , naked jews made crawl through streets their knees persons , which article linked some way catholic church . i think information apochryphal ; , what this food ?	-1
today i purchased my first probably last issue gourmet . while there plenty recipes ( some which i won't use but they still cool look ) there tons ads . it makes you wonder either ) how much people who make this magazine get paid or ) all ads why this isn't free . i see need few ads so we consumers don't pay fortune good magazine . but i took out 33 pages ads figured there 140 full page ads . that over half magazine which 260 pages . that really sad . recipe wise , some them look interesting very gourmet , but there things you need i can't get middle u.s. three six articles interesting read - when you could find them slipped inbetween their plethora ads . fine cooking still best one out there	-1

back 1970 my grandmother subscribed prevention . time , it wonderful magazine , filled informative articles aimed " prevention " illness promotion wellness ( founder prevention , j.i. rodale preached ) . articles role vitamins nutrition light years ahead their time . ( j.i. given lot credit bringing vitamins supplements mainstream ) . over years , especially after tragic death robert rodale ( . i . ' son ) , takeover his wife daughter , it unfortunately transformed into fluffy , tabloid-like " women magazine " scantily clad women covers , one- or two-page articles instructing women get killer abs burn fat . i think j.i. rodale probably spinning his grave see what his descendents butcher this magazine , which bears no resemblence whatsoever what it used . i flipped through copy disgust recently note , reviewer stated , plenty ads drugs which really seems go against idea preventing illness first place ( whereas old prevention sang praises vitamins health foods ) . i don't know why rodale family doesn't just scrap title call it something else , but alas , they major corporation now i little hope this magazine improve any time soon	-1
friend once said me , " if you want glossy no brainer then get vogue ! " how right she , despite glorious photography , fashion models daren't stand sideways or you wouldn't able see them occasional good article it , i admit i find vogue too pretentious . vogue wants voice fashion , voice high brow media but its clientele likes you me , ordinary people who can't afford live high life they portraying its gloss filled pages . personally i'd rather spend my money movie ticket , i get see good thriller , sci-fi , romance etc , etc i don't know substence abuse emotional demons haunt particular actor life , i'm just interested enjoying myself couple hours before i go back my hard working life real world . vogue trying sell me dream i don't really want buy into , never penchant selling my soul devil , it gets two stars though because photography really superb , shame rest it though	1
i would like classify myself moderate but i probably lean conservative . because , i subscribed harpers so i could read good writing would challenge my beliefs stretch my mind new ways . i got , more or less , first , but over course couple years magazine drifted further further leftist propaganda screed , worst which louis lapham bitter drivel editorials . it got point where writing incredibly predictable ; i knew exactly what position ( read : left pelosi ) writer -- any writer harpers -- would take whatever issue , i pretty good idea what line whining would . if you attend dinner parties upper east side ; if you drive prius oscars ; if you think commercial organic farming environmental travesty ; if you've ever desecrated starbucks , then look no more -- this magazine you . however , if you're dumbfounded how republicans keep winning elections -- then you realize they democratic party opponents ; if you realize genius george bush karl rove getting liberals underestimate george bush karl rove ; if you want read smart , insightful writing inform entertain , then try atlantic monthly ( which , way , i am surprised see reviewers describe liberal magazine ; i think it moderate , if anything , bit conservative side . ) needless say , i let my harpers subscription lapse . two stars , tho , harper index -- however , wasn't worth price subscription ( it got only thing worth anything price subscription ) .	1
so i ordered magazine nov . 6 , 2005 . its now feb . 22nd , 2006 magazines ( since i also ordered smithsonian scientific american ) nowhere seen . course , my account quickly charged this pace , i'm guessing whole genomic structure all living organisms this planet decoded before i receive any them ... so if you actually want read this excellent magazine , it might better idea get somewhere else ..	-1

this magazine used thick , fun read , full information . but 5 years ago . now it just flimsy looking mag filled vulgarities non-sense . editorial almost always filled political opinions . i won't renew my subscription	-1
this magazine reads like inflight magazine : something airlines , careful not stir any scary adreneline rushes , put out lull their readers sleep . not controversy here . no thought-provocation . don't you wish someone out there would publish really good magazine books ? one featured meaty stories well-written reviews ? well , alas , this one ain't it . it dull bland . occasionally it offers up conservative book review neocon writer catherine seipp , who enlightening bill o'reilly ( , entertaining offensive laughably stupid ) so this sometimes cut dull . but someone here said bland i agree . avoid this one if you iq above 90 . pick up new yorker , atlantic monthly or harper if you like read intelligent writing . or , if you like romance novels , mysteries other badly written pieces fluff -- which all this magazine covers -- this might just thing you . i want my money back	-1
i ordered magizine subsribtion when i ordered they told me it would take up 6 weeks , so i went out bought months issue . few weeks later issue came , which understandable but they sent me previous month before . i hadnt even ordered my subsription month .	1
i agree those who didn't care it . only thing i liked one article written dad who skateboarding his son . it witty , insightful inspirational . rest mag just seemed totally irrelevent my life . it aimed people who dry-clean their childrens clothes . anyone ? i don't want my kids concerned clothes money . few issues i read made me mad depressed . i've never written review before but felt compelled so regarding this lame magazine . give me break $400 cashmere hoodie my son ! my son likes his vilified character t-shirts what matters . he not reflection my style , he reflection his own . get over yourselves	1
i suscribed this magazine since i got great offer it company i get my other suscriptions so i decided , why not ?? its year , although previews each week prime-time programs fun ( 2 pages worth ) i very dissapointed . articles empty , boring some downright retarded ; rehashing show dialogues , requoteing newscomments - its mistery me how this magazine still around . i realize this entertainment magazine , but still , articles people magazine seem like rocket science comparison - gasp !!! yourself favor just buy tv guide - much more interestin	1
i've subscriber this over 10 years i've loved getting this , but it undergone changes recently not better . specifically , i hate what they've graphical design inside . whereas they used employ several different styles when it came things like fonts artwork whatever subject written , now they've adopted uniform style where nearly everything looks same . it looked better before . writing isn't witty or sharp ( longtime staff departed ? ) , there " filler " pieces form moronic sidebars boxes - useless attempts humor simply don't work . strength magazine continues come critics , especially movie dvd section . sadly , typically , when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like i'm going consider letting my sub expire ' cos i don't let my mailbox fill crap like this	1
i never received this magazine so how would i able rate it ?? i cant even find way let them know i never received it	-1
change good ; however , sometimes change very bad . earlier this year pc mag decided become magazine masses instead providing technical information their longtime dedicated readers . before change this magazine i would keep year or so refer back content ; now i skim it 5 minutes don't feel there reason keep it any length time . longtime subscriber ( 20 years ) i not re-subscribing magazine . i wish them luck , but i believe they lost sight their subscription base chasing broader base subscribers might disappoint them	-1
i just cancelled my subscription recommended my daughter cancel one i bought my 14 year-old grandson . some reason ziff-davis marketers think full page ads selling sex videos appropiate pc magazine .

it shame but reviewer made comment this magazine not any balanced view what serious world news what fluff hit nail head . it skims surface ' pop ' . anyone reading this would entertained but none wiser what going real world . again it shame if this all people read what going world ( newsweek exactly same ) especially united states . time magazine same people gave us cnn unfortunately symptomatic liberal media inexorable consolidation all media particularly u.s. resulting blandness lack real choice . other irritating thing time it tone which patronising little supercilious . subscribe economist , there less pictures !	-1

when you subscribe wall street journal it like getting two newspapers : good news reporting paper what times seems like editorial page written sophmomores local young americans freedom college rag . it not i mind right-wing editorials , i'm somewhat libertarian myself , it just its editorial page puts ideology ahead reason far too often my taste . much better deal -- business news , all financial quotes , much better international coverage , excellent concise reporting -- choose financial times . moment annual subscription selling $50 . it much better publication saturday very fine weekend section good book reviews arts culture coverage . also because ft based out london editors much more balanced less cowed or ideologically obedient . even if they similarly priced ft would better deal . it ft costs fraction price wsj .	1
kissinger , honorary chairman national interest , going head-up 9/11 whitewash commission , but he begged off when families objected . dov zakheim , 2.3 trillion dollar missing unaccounted pentagon funds man , journal board . one better off reading commentary magazine , where least " neocon fascist madmen " ( web tarpley phrase ) state their case clearer more honest - if that word - prose . i remember reading one article national interest which actually made assertion we , meaning usa , need engage terrorism occassion . i couldn't believe they would actually print something like , but they . this fundamentally dishonest journal waste time , most part , because it neither interesting ( statement described above paragraph notwithstanding ) nor meant , main , really other than fool public . kissinger i strong suspicion knows what happened 9/11 so i suspect zakheim ( put it mildly latter case ) , yet they pretend official version true . supporting this journal supporting bad guys	-1

don't purchase subscriptions amazon or magazine express . following my experiences subscription hiragana times amazon . what this page doesn't tell you japanese magazines subscribed amazon filled company called magazine express shipped seamail japan which mean you'll recieve every issue 8 10 after it released . i placed my order january , date , not recieved single issue . after several phone calls , magazine express people ( who fill amazon subscriptions ) said they restart my subscription may issues which take 8-10 weeks due shipping issues . so after ordering january , i not receive single issue this uncancelable magazine until possibly late july . very poor service . this unacceptable magazine most us japanese bookstores ( fujisan one ) get within week or you order directly publisher only few dollars more . if i known shipping policy i would not ordered magazine supplier , magazine express not cancel subscrition . i advise avoiding all amazon magazine subsriptions due their poorly stated policies . ** update , i wrote this review june . it now july 8th i've just informed i must wait until august 15th see if issue arrives . i ordered magazine january 9th i no resolution either magazine express or amazon who provides no way contact anyone within amazon magazine orders . i reiterate , buying magazines amazon if poor idea	-1
well , imagine my surprise when i picked up february 2004 issue , found things drastically changed . mainly editor letter . it used 1 page , now it just small little column now , exactly like other ziff davis game mags , now redesign isnt bad other zd game mags , but removal 1 page editor letter , really steams me up . least they didnt bother executive editor robert coffey scorched earth column . it still 1 page . it last page usually . yes redesign really bad terms readability . most time they red or blue or yellow background , it really hard read text times . now least their disc auto-load , unlike pc gamer . what really pisses me off , when magazine hot 100 section , or best pc or videocards , or peripherals section , they hardly ever change captions or descriptions come it . i'm sorry if i got off track lot , but i felt need . i hope this review helped you . edit : 5/8/2004 pc gamer recently changed editor editor-in-chief re-assigned become editor-in-chief official xbox magazine . new eic pcg former executive editor , i hate him , so this why i say cgw now best pc games magazine	1
i got this magazine year half before i quit my subscription recently . i liked all fashion tips articles how dress your body size style , why i subscribed begin . but i not expecting bombardment amoral opinions forced me . ( not mention overload advertising- which you get most fashion magazines anyway , so that not complaint ) . sure there few lines here there nonbiased ( telling facts stds such ) , but 90% articles sex , opinion not fact . girls today sex anyone getting hurt emotionally physically because magazines like seventeen who say sex good if you're ready ( what 15 year old girl ready sex get std or baby ?? please . ) , condoms 100% effective . they not , but that what most teen girls believe because stupid magazines like this . they need take advice their parents doctors , not magazine articles . i disgusted opinions presented truth basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences .	1
admittedly , i am slightly older than " relevant " demographic . but i'm not 40 yet ! so there number things here some appeal me . i applaud magazine attempting address culturally important issues . still , magazine suffers it unrelenting fawning over whole post-modern vibe it own sense self-importance beacon charismatic hipness . ( " hey , look out , world ! we jesus freaks ipods too ! " ) usually , more something or someone sweats proclaim their own relevance , more danger there they become irrelevant . so , like it spiritual cousin " charisma , " this magazine suffers somewhat shallow perspective life culture . it trumpets its ability ask " tough questions , " even it follows relatively safe , politically correct post-mod/charismatic/hipster wannabe party line . i mean , their idea cutting edge put bono cover . if you want cutting edge , put libertine adam clayton cover ask him bono faith . now , i would read article ! ( i am major u2 bono fan . i'm not knocking him ; just lack imagination " relevant " . ) there also way too much emulation world perspective generational heritage . " hey , we're young , we're smart , we don't need anything way our geezer parents it . " i guess little gray hair or wrinkles doesn't cut it today paris hilton culture , but i'd like think it might little different culture shaped biblical values . actually , " relevant " seems little afraid say what " biblical values " ( beyond obvious politically expedient ones ); it all seems amorphous here . i've never fan whole " what hot/what not " ethos . , i'd like give little more respect today christian young people think they could handle something didn't fall into same faddish trap . i am hopeful they may get it right yet " relevant " . times , they seem tantilizingly close . but it takes more than slick hairdo , male earrings , chin stubble , idolization youth , culture icon quotations , psycobabble " cool dude " theological lingo make one relevant	1
first off , i subscribed this magazine couple years , enjoyed it . but " main guy " robert kennedy , someone who offends me both personally politically . he assumes every girl/women reading magazine tiny . his information , some us work out 5-6 days week eat well , still heavy-set . his comments heavy-set people offensive , thoughtless , sometimes even downright cruel . nonetheless , pictures/articles inspiring me , it decent fitness magazine	1

i used enjoyed discover , but past several months their radicals changes , got me think real dumbing down . once awhile , they would put together good article - but not constantly . how we enlighten ourselves improve our intelligence science etc world stage . there still many us not want glued computer science we would tv . discover editorial staff ought get their magazine back track or circulation subscriber base going go down tube . thank goodness scientific american , astronomy , sky telescope , science news havent fallen down . i am not renewing my subscription unless discover ' rediscovers ' itself . how dumb americans !	1
i am also longtime subscriber , i am quite outraged new changes made magazine . i written letter editor containing my list grievances , if you ( i would hope they would redressed but they probably ignore me ) . anyway , please read : i am current subscriber , quite suprised discover new look ( all reading this review amazon.com: amazon.com not display updated version what discover currently looks like ) . i didn't quite care it , but long material stayed same i going allright it . unfortunately , articles discover degenerated into " top 20 things you didn't know ... " lists , piles trivia , some sexual humor editorializing recent news . sure , reading gay astronauts may little humorous . it appropriate what discover stood or what i expected this magazine ? i would disagree . occasionally there intelligent article . cover story still seems up par stories old discover . i really once enjoy this magazine it most expected item arrive my mailbox . i've kept all my copies last five years best condition i possibly could because i truly enjoy reading them , still . maybe this new discover " new generation " or meant lure younger or less mature readers , but i think change articles taken turn worse . i think ordinary person , " lay man " if you , would appreciate least intelligent articles new , interesting groundbreaking discoveries scientific community . i remember string theory article ( i forget which issue exactly ) one most well-written articles topic . it very exciting , most importantly it [ i]got me interested science[/i ] . i doubt i ever see anything good discover magazine again . i'd really hate give up this magazine : all i ask old discover back .	1

i echo same gripe other reviewers voiced here : magazine covers same handful people week after week after boring week . how many times reader going see no talents such jessica simpson , lindsay lohan , tom cruise-katie holmes joke , most overrated , overhyped people all time brad pitt angelina jolie cover not get tired it ? it nice know what going certain celebrities once while but every single week ? you say " overkill ? " i'm glad i never got subscription this magazine . i picked it up every once while newsstand but stopped because i so sick tired reading overrated , overhyped glorified b-movie " actors " " actresses " who lucky one successful movie haven't anything value since . i picked up copy today sworn it off forever . don't waste your time or your money . - donna di giacom	1
this magazine just page after page hollywood p.r. agencies releases . unbelievable . why didn't i think it ? i know all magazines look editorial content outside sources , but other than few pages very subjective movie/music/book reviews , this magazine just re-writes prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again again again . this magazine must not staff writers , but must employ army copy editors manning warehouse dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes . funniest thing this magazine how first few pages may dedicated typically obsequious press release provided , say , tom cruise management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - then you turn movie review section where some clever , sassy , wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds tell you movie absolutely sucks . uh , okay - wait , didn't you get press release ? if you tivo extra theme entertainment tonight your ringtone , this magazine right up your alley . otherwise , don't waste penny this nonsense .	-1

if you're teenage guitarist want learn nickelback , green day , nu-metal songs , then this magazine you . there also some pretty good tips beginners time time . but last several years quality feature articles interviews gone steadily downhill , there far too many ads . many people said , sometimes it doesn't seem geared towards musicians all anymore . smarmy , " hipper than thou " rolling stone , spin , pitchfork media style writing seems taking over mag . other styles music such blues , country , jazz , etc , pretty much ignored . but like i said , if you're teenager you see it newsstand there song it you would like learn , pick it up , otherwise avoid this magazine	1

you tell title , i'm not enamored this magazine . i've playing video games since early 80s , read many , many gaming magazines . my reasons this negative review gamepro follow no particular order : 1 . ) their numerical rating system stinks . 1-5 points just not accurate enough . most mags/web sites 1-10 system decimals . not gamepro . 2 . ) written part reviews way too short , often written borderline incoherantly . it if they hired proverbial 1,000 monkeys type them out . 3 . ) often times they cram two or three reviews one page . screen shots provided reviews often size postage stamp . 4 . ) number ads relation content distinctly high . once when i bored , i counted all ads one issue . out around 110 pages there 60+ pages ads . 5 . ) their article layouts confusing , occasionally they print colored backgrounds closely match text color . forget reading it if you're colorblind . 6 . ) their gaming tips either so obvious brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out , or plain don't work . i suspect ones ripped off various web sites . 7 . ) gamepro costs same better gaming mags , such egm game informer . so , closing ... if you want good gaming magazine , just any magazine other than gamepro would improvement . many great gaming magazines come gone , why turd like gamepro continues mystery me	-1

i'de never read vibe first place , but i won free years subscription some online contest . i must also mention i'm huge fan hip-hop hip-hop culture , so i'de think vibe would tight ..... daamn , i ever wrong . first off , half mag advertising .... then what little reading there .... it all bullsh ** . interviews they artists totally weak watered down . they never ask any worthwhile questions . vibe also contradicts itself constantly . one issue , they'll give album low rating poor review , then end year they name same album one years best .... what f*** ? vibe it decent moments , but i def . won't paying it anytime soon .	1

first off , i usually just stick rating critiquing movies . but , every time i see ad this website this time/warner ( or whatever hell company calls itself this week ) rag-mag i start see red . " entertainment weekly " , which once interesting weekly deluge ho-hum everyday life , become just rag crapped out weekly stand newstands week after week prostituting your hard earned cash . back summer 89 , " ew " released after i read few issues , i decided subscribe . i instantly hooked ( new issue would arrive my mailbox saturday before it would hit regular newstands ) i liked getting latest news reviews movies , music , t.v. , video ( later added mid-90 ) . problem magazine started late 90 . i started notice " ew " would cover big movie or event hadn't yet released then following week bash hell out it , or try get some piece dirt it order generate more sales . i also hate damn lists " ew " comes up . latest entitled " top 100 most memorable movie lines " joke . these lists always annoyed me , because i feel they truly not thought out therefore not thought provoking . other most important thing i noticed absolute lack honest review . case point , few weeks ago i picked up latest issue which movie " catwoman " reviewed ( i wasn't sure if it gleiberman or shwarzbaum critiqued it ) . i first logged onto " rotten tomatoes.com " see what percentile " catwoman " recieved nation critics . out roughly 115 reviews " catwoman " only got 10% good reviews while rest trashed it ( film needs , least , get grade 60 - 65% order place it fresh or good movie ) . makes " catwoman " worst reviewed film , so far , 2004 . yet , " ew " gave film . what erkes me even more " catwoman " released " warner bros . " , same company owns rights " harry potter " films , " lord rings " trilogy , yes , " wb " owns " entertainment weekly " . " warner bros . " trying bribe or threaten its own critics one its most popular lucrative magazine ? i'm not only who seen this developement . people written saying there favoritism among " warner " products reviewed magazine . " ew " , course , hotly denies anything kind thumping there chests standing behind there reviews , possibly fear fired ( they deny also ) . my only question reviewers " entertainment weekly " , " whats it like stand your own pile bull**it ? " or better yet , " what it like stand democratic podium ? "	-1
this one many magazines float around school library , it most common . maybe because not too many people read it . all it pure celebrity gossip . there really nothing else here . if you like blurry photos lindsay lohan , donald trump , paris hilton , simon cowell , paula abdul like , ( blurry so you can't see zits flaws ) then you should get this . one article mentioned britney spears stomach , how it coming back . she wearing baggy t-shirt . baggy t-shirts common among women wanting hide gut , not flaunt it . this magazine makes it seem like celebrities lose weight like magic ( they don't-not so far i tell ) . if you want read fact nichole richie acquired yet chloe paddington , fact donald trump thinks his wife melania looks hideous now he gotten her knocked up , or you would like see photos victoria beckham looking pissed off , then read this . this magazine full lies well-for instance , one writer claims young people like lindsay lohan get higher car insurance rates accidents they not fault . false ! you only get higher rates if you fault . this magazine nothing more than overpriced tabloid . there nothing value here . half time insider some anonymous friend , half time facts aren't right . avoid this thing all costs , unless course you celebrity worshipper . i've got better things than worship people who too much money their own good . i'll stick more intelligent fare , thankyouverymuch	-1

i am time person year 2003 ( shared title - actively deployed u.s. servicemembers ) . i must say reading time magazine like reading platform democratic party . actually it even worse than it like reading john dean diary , filled more fantasy personal wishes than actual reality . one latest online edition realists taken over washington . give me break . new set hogs come take over troff it . anyone who believes nancy pelosi her gang political hacks going help america fool . best thing we hope they create so much gridlock no one spend any money washington . maybe then they see america improves its own politicians both side make things awful . sad thing people read this publication actually think they walk away knowing something world . this publication so biased it not only misinforms its readers it makes them look like fools when they try repeat what they " learned " . if you want truly useful weekly news publication then subscribe economist . it probably not change your political affiliations but it least make you sound competent when you debate others . economist quite simply best weekly news magazine existence . articles well written people know what they talking . leaders around world read contribute economist . this something time , newsweek rest their ilk cannot claim . i am not affiliated any political parties not consider myself political . i look things economic perspective vote accordingly	-1

well , imagine my surprise when i picked up february 2004 issue , found things drastically changed . mainly editor letter . it used 1 page , now it just small little column now , exactly like other ziff davis game mags , now redesign isnt bad other zd game mags , but removal 1 page editor letter , really steams me up . least they didnt bother executive editor robert coffey scorched earth column . it still 1 page . it last page usually . yes redesign really bad terms readability . most time they red or blue or yellow background , it really hard read text times . now least their disc auto-load , unlike pc gamer . what really pisses me off , when magazine hot 100 section , or best pc or videocards , or peripherals section , they hardly ever change captions or descriptions come it . i'm sorry if i got off track lot , but i felt need . i hope this review helped you . edit : 5/8/2004 pc gamer recently changed editor editor-in-chief re-assigned become editor-in-chief official xbox magazine . new eic pcg former executive editor , i hate him , so this why i say cgw now best pc games magazine	1
i began subscribing gourmet 1961 , continued subscribe forty years . i also gifted family members subscriprions . i discontinued my subscription because magazine deteriorated so much last several years : there so many ads tear-outs magazine one hardly find recipes , least half magazine , sometimes more ; also i object " political , " some downright offensive , articles . i am catholic , i very offended outrageous article charging , during nazi era , naked jews made crawl through streets their knees persons , which article linked some way catholic church . i think information apochryphal ; , what this food ?	-1
i got this magazine year half before i quit my subscription recently . i liked all fashion tips articles how dress your body size style , why i subscribed begin . but i not expecting bombardment amoral opinions forced me . ( not mention overload advertising- which you get most fashion magazines anyway , so that not complaint ) . sure there few lines here there nonbiased ( telling facts stds such ) , but 90% articles sex , opinion not fact . girls today sex anyone getting hurt emotionally physically because magazines like seventeen who say sex good if you're ready ( what 15 year old girl ready sex get std or baby ?? please . ) , condoms 100% effective . they not , but that what most teen girls believe because stupid magazines like this . they need take advice their parents doctors , not magazine articles . i disgusted opinions presented truth basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences .	1
i like read cook illustrated library . their magazine much too expensive small amount recipes included within . i like tips sent readers , some product reviews . i found most their recipes very involved -- nitpicky , kind . lemon meringue pie recipe -- which i tried their " america test kitchen " cookbook -- calls cooking cornstarch water , cooling it , then beating solution into meringue . supposedly this keeps meringue destabilizing . all happened my kitchen i found little lumps cornstarch glue bottom my mixing bowl while scraping out meringue . i made meringue before without cornstarch , can't help thinking this extra step isn't neccessary . their " best " brownies good , but i make equally good brownies without all extra steps involved melting chocolate cooling it , etc . if you're looking easy , fool proof recipes , don't take gazillion steps aren't fussy exactly what ingredients you use , this isn't magazine you	1
cook illustrated first cooking magazine i'd found myself truly motivated read cover-to-cover , even though they insert advertisements their own products , which i suppose , them , makes this " ad-free " magazine , but i'm not surprised they've bent rules claim . one time i found it necessary contact cook illustrated customer service issue , i simply floored treatment i received ... i'll simply leave it . i personally don't intend re-subscribing ( " fine cooking " , here i come ! ) . you , however , may find this cooking magazine you . , far what they goes , cook illustrated good what they - i'll give them . if you not found this review helpful , i'm sorry if i haven't made value my warning apparent . just know there those us out there who bad experiences , simply trying prevent others experiencing same .	1
i started my first subscription this one 1980-81 . it excellent !! it all kinds great advice help real issues relating " preventing " ailments/conditions . now it little advertising manual drug users fad dieters ! wow ... what change now . i'm not interested " paying " read ads . i'll get my motivation information more reliable sources . besides , i got tired all little order forms kept falling out my lap while i rode stationery bike ! what waste trees . :	-1

this magazine just page after page hollywood p.r. agencies releases . unbelievable . why didn't i think it ? i know all magazines look editorial content outside sources , but other than few pages very subjective movie/music/book reviews , this magazine just re-writes prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again again again . this magazine must not staff writers , but must employ army copy editors manning warehouse dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes . funniest thing this magazine how first few pages may dedicated typically obsequious press release provided , say , tom cruise management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - then you turn movie review section where some clever , sassy , wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds tell you movie absolutely sucks . uh , okay - wait , didn't you get press release ? if you tivo extra theme entertainment tonight your ringtone , this magazine right up your alley . otherwise , don't waste penny this nonsense .	-1

oh those days , when i college , reading my first issues then subscribing . there great things found its pages , columns brian crozier , russell kirk , erik von kuenhelt-leddhin ( sp ? ) . great struggle soviet union going into critical stage . it seemed nr so right track . it wonderful read , least 1979 1983 . but then it became while duller . it some periods recrudescence , such under editorship john o'sullivan . but when rich lowry took over nr really began dumb down ( nothing personal mr. lowry ) . but what i've really discovered late how badly neo-con agenda sort taken over magazine . we've got 50th anniversary issue call midge dector rally country our illegal immoral war iraq . really something happened magazine , sinister force entrenched itself there . what force ? well , go come-and-hear.com you begin learn part picture , especially when you read material elizabeth dilling . i would also recommend paul findley they dare speak out , which details israeli lobby domination our congress . nr once courageous conservative magazine , but now it heavily tainted influence terrible thing . wfb should know better , maybe he . if he doesn't , then he should pick up neo-conned ! neo-conned again !, then he should listen tony martin talk given ihr certain group tactics deployed suppress free speech . what inspired me write this review wfb recent column incarceration david irving . it ends disgusting gloating . wfb fallen into evil trap , so magazine he used run . what happened christian faith people like buckley ? he now seems lost terribly afraid offending supposedly saintly interest group ... you , mr. lowry , come now : read widely deeply don't afraid reading talmud israeli lobby . once you , maybe you'll develop strength think outside box . we're going if we want anything but bleakest future mankind planet .	1

legend goes there time few decades ago when " gramophone " unquestioned authority reviews recordings classical music . whether or not legend true ( i'm too young know ) , gramophone time definitely passed . today there multitude sources free information classical music internet , newsgroups websites . some it less well-informed than gramophone criticism , but some it more well-informed . what undeniable , price few mouse-clicks , it possible find far greater range reviews recordings internet than gramophone ( its british-based critics ) offer . what more , gramophone tied business-model classical music industry fast becoming obsolete . historically , most important classical recordings issued few so-called " major " companies such emi , deutsche grammophon cbs ( later sony ) . these " majors " would buy lavish advertising spreads gramophone so finance magazine . return , gramophone would devote lengthy reviews majors ' new releases would produce pages fluffy interviews musicians under contract majors . today situation different . most interesting new release more likely appear mp3 obscure russian website than new cd sony . small companies , dedicated solely classical music recordings , produce great results shoestring budgets while " major " corporations virtually abandoned new classical recordings . this development causes problems gramophone business model . new players classical music industry don't publicity budgets fund glossy magazine like gramophone through advertising . gramophone implicit bargain : " advertise us or we won't review your recordings " , magazine seems becoming more more irrelevant . if you want subscribe classical music periodical , i recommend " international record review " or " fanfare " . both offer substantially more reviews per month than gramophone . but most all , i suggest checking out huge range classical music information available free web usenet	1

my family received this magazine years , but recently we decided not re-new our subscription . this used quality product but it recently gone downhill inclusion more more advertising each issue . this point , nearly half magazine consists advertisements -- this isn't real science magazine it claims , waste money . content not all great . articles often extremely short , too short even pre-teen audience . my kids often wished this magazine included more serious science topics , not just shortened , dumbed-down material . much magazine full " fluff " -- things like word searches picture matching games , which didn't interest my children . content might okay 7-8 year olds children slightly lower reading levels , but older children bored . all all , i'd recommend you simply get regular , adult version national geographic . though articles might too complex children , pictures make up what they can't read . if you're looking more children's-oriented magazine , you're better off muse , high quality general science magazine published smithsonian museum washington , dc . however , muse caters slightly older audience , perhaps ages 9 up .	1

i would like classify myself moderate but i probably lean conservative . because , i subscribed harpers so i could read good writing would challenge my beliefs stretch my mind new ways . i got , more or less , first , but over course couple years magazine drifted further further leftist propaganda screed , worst which louis lapham bitter drivel editorials . it got point where writing incredibly predictable ; i knew exactly what position ( read : left pelosi ) writer -- any writer harpers -- would take whatever issue , i pretty good idea what line whining would . if you attend dinner parties upper east side ; if you drive prius oscars ; if you think commercial organic farming environmental travesty ; if you've ever desecrated starbucks , then look no more -- this magazine you . however , if you're dumbfounded how republicans keep winning elections -- then you realize they democratic party opponents ; if you realize genius george bush karl rove getting liberals underestimate george bush karl rove ; if you want read smart , insightful writing inform entertain , then try atlantic monthly ( which , way , i am surprised see reviewers describe liberal magazine ; i think it moderate , if anything , bit conservative side . ) needless say , i let my harpers subscription lapse . two stars , tho , harper index -- however , wasn't worth price subscription ( it got only thing worth anything price subscription ) .	1

i've watching this magazine slide downhill some time , but they've finally hit bottom . bulk april 25 2006 magazine devoted cars . yes , todays automobiles becoming highly computerized , but magazine supposed highlight software hardware we use our desktops . pc mag drifting far afield , doing articles apple computers , gaming systems , extensive reviews cameras . instead pcs , subject seems anything computer chip it , or some way remotely related computers . obvious inference there nothing interesting going pc world , so they keep stretching just fill pages . i find hard believe ; i think it more likely staff lost their focus , or they've hired people who not interested or qualified write pcs . lack pertinent content makes dwindling size magazine even more apparent . what used rival small phone book now size time magazine . they now " new look " , it awful . their readership used consist well educated , technically sophisticated professionals . these people don't need dozen arrows pointing into every photograph , cutesy " handwritten " notes belaboring obvious . that more appropriate folks who hard time getting through high school short attention spans . compare this issue issues couple years ago , it obvious they've " dumbed down " entire magazine . i've subscribed pc magazine years , considered it " must read " keep up rapidly evolving hardware software pc world . but no more -- it time find one something useful write subject personal computers .	-1
you tell title , i'm not enamored this magazine . i've playing video games since early 80s , read many , many gaming magazines . my reasons this negative review gamepro follow no particular order : 1 . ) their numerical rating system stinks . 1-5 points just not accurate enough . most mags/web sites 1-10 system decimals . not gamepro . 2 . ) written part reviews way too short , often written borderline incoherantly . it if they hired proverbial 1,000 monkeys type them out . 3 . ) often times they cram two or three reviews one page . screen shots provided reviews often size postage stamp . 4 . ) number ads relation content distinctly high . once when i bored , i counted all ads one issue . out around 110 pages there 60+ pages ads . 5 . ) their article layouts confusing , occasionally they print colored backgrounds closely match text color . forget reading it if you're colorblind . 6 . ) their gaming tips either so obvious brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out , or plain don't work . i suspect ones ripped off various web sites . 7 . ) gamepro costs same better gaming mags , such egm game informer . so , closing ... if you want good gaming magazine , just any magazine other than gamepro would improvement . many great gaming magazines come gone , why turd like gamepro continues mystery me	-1
harper bazaar pretty decent fashion magazine , but i wish now i never gotten subscription . true , each issue would more expensive , but1 ) i could pick out what issues seemed worth buying , some thin empty2 ) they quite often late their delivery or you miss issue . i only gotten one issue time , honest .	1
i decided i write review newsweek this morning , after i came across yet biased , over-hyped cover story . this particular one entitled , " rethinking marriage crunch , " goes back everything they presented 20 years ago woman chances getting married later life . this undoubtedly very easy them they probably no evidence their assertion first time around , neglected any this occasion . i really think reviewer comparison people quite apt , but newsweek also provides reliably pro-sexual revolution pro-sixties counter-culture take almost every issue . two years ago , we made privy bit front page sensationalism concerning " infidelity chic . " yes , it seems , according their sources , spousal cheating all rage even though they argue , without even hint contradiction , everybody still wants get married much ever before . i find magazine [ ... ] they offer opinion instead news ; theirs mission persuasion . overall , there little which recommend this publication it geared readership trivial people who possess depth kiddy pool .	1
psychology today purports deliver latest trends psychological studies layman , but what it really delivers pop psychology whole lot advertisements . i give magazine one star very snazzy layout , second star hiring writers don't insult reader intelligence abusing alliteration ( unlike magazine supposedly aimed intelligent adults ) . however , content consistently concerned more pop culture than lives real people . i also noticed bias against introverts article after article attacks shyness serious character defect , rather than simply personality trait ( so , introverts , if you want avoid yet lecture how your way relating world intrinsically wrong , avoid this rag )	1
this definitely inferior rag big trio science monthlies . filled poorly-written articles . i actually went back home depot once get refund this magazine . it indeed worth gas time get refund if you actually pay this magazine . this magazine promotes commercial products , no i'm not talking advertisements , but actual articles themselves . magazine not news magazine , it just one big advertising rag where manufacturers paid get . if you like paying ads , go it	1
i'm sure this review isn't unique . spin rotates same ten bands its cover , not mention ridiculous articles written within . time they get describing ' euro-punk-indie-pop artist just slammed them face their way train station their jazzed up sound ' i've completely forgotten point thier article . they must greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they tag onto useless music still manage say nothing . they sound like cyber-nerds who need get out little more stop getting thier info mtv.com . i'm sure i've learned more what thier editors office any given day than anything remotely close music while reading spin . next time you see it stands , i suggest you spin direction	-1
why ? because it underestimates our intelligence ! it nothing natural health . it advertisements . it empty , completelly . more : it looks like woman magazine but i believe clever woman would feel like i feel now , angry ! i paid something i believed but it not . ok , we make mistakes	-1
nice cover pictures headlines , but way too many ads . there reason its only twelve bucks , this ad-sponsored mag	1
this definitely magazine gearheads . it pretty much just equipment reviews advertisements . i would given it higher rating but two things : 1 ) i don't think i've ever seen popular photography not love any piece equipment . reviews still useful if you're just wondering what features new gizmo , but still , they ought bit more critical if they're going such review based magazine . 2 ) many ads vendors bad reputations . i believe they make some sort claim requiring certain level honesty anyone they sell ad space , but it sure doesn't look like they ever kicked anyone out magazine me . so what you when you magazine full uncritical reviews , occasional beginnerish article technique , lot ads stores dubious virtue ? best 2 star magazine	1
writing seems come under-educated teenage males who try too hard look sound cool . i wasn't sure if i reading magazine or viewing internet chatroom filled juveniles . this magazine isn't men , it boys . however , one star photos women which , we can't deny , both men boys appreciate	-1
i told this magazine good look design ideas . it isn't really , there isn't really much this magazine . it just tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked august september issues only things those two impressed me features elton john out africa fundraiser article julian mcmahon . rest it ads , not classy type ads make advertising tolerable vogue magazine , but same old ads you'll see anywhere else , they annoying . there several nonsense fashion articles likes kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one my professors would call it " plastic person syndrome " ) mark consuelos , waay too much jennifer garner her baby , other weird things , such trend designer cupcakes . i wish i kidding latter , but i am not , nor i $25 spend glorified cupcake just because it jessica alba favorite . there entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because stars it way here . despite size this magazine , there very little sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos same old same old , tips mimicking them . i am not interested becoming teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested seeing vanessa carlton pad . this magazine you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , subscription actually not year ( it says special issues count regular issues magazine ) your life ambition try cupcake bakery new york because some celebrity . this magazine mediocre best , worst part , it exact same fashion advice vogue . i went vogue because there substance their magazine , ads classy very chic . leave this one behind-it looks me like brain fluff read folks aol time warner .	1
i subscribed bhg their website ended up subscribing additional year . articles helpful degree but layout this magazine , its overwhelming amount advertising , takes away any good points . i've found style choppy very difficult read because ads . it hard tell how long article or where it starts . i rarely find anything i'd want save . overall disappointment	1
i started reciving vibe magazine mail announced unexpected . this wouldn't first time this happened , turns out my grandmother bought me people magazine gift copies sent my house . i figured somebody got me this magazine gift . next thing i know charge magazine appears my bank statement . i called vibe immediately asked them what happened . they told me there nothing they could their company didn't directly deal payment issues subscription services . they gave me toll free number i too call outside company handled payments . when i called this company , it completely automated service , could not speak actual person regardless what extension i used . i eventually go down my bank find out what i could . turns out vibe illegally gained my bank account number charging me months , but i only just recently started recieve magazine . i close down my checking account open up new one , which resulted me charged my gym other other companies access my account order subtract monthly bills . it if i written them bad check , something i never my life now greatly questioned my credibility . please not support these people , they theives top magazine terrible uncredible . i seriously hope my review help deter any all people subscribing this magazine	-1

i reading this magazine work , i consider it trashy magazine . it only focuses sexual part women , like if sex best thing world , because they this article which girl riding taxi , she thought taxi guy fine , so she unbutton her shirt told taxi guy touch her breasts . then she says it * best experience she ever . i just cant believe they publish garbage like , giving message women its ok undress yourself total stranger , who you dont even know . i prefer read things focus more inner heart , emotional , spiritual side things . read books help me better person right now future , throw away garbage this society	-1
great magazine but beware subscriptions . my subscription paid back august ' 06 i yet see copy ( january ' 07 ) . their customer service assured me twice they would send out my magazines but nothing ever arrives . plus , phone number they provided not service ! its shame because magazine looks really well	-1
i subscribed hobby farm after reading two issues i cancelled it . i read article march/april issue show birds . then , i got my may/june issue . don schrider , communication director albc , wrote correct story . article claimed " over 1000 " birds show , correction 11,640 birds present . other correction regarding earlobe color egg shell color stating there exceptions red earlobe/ brown eggs white earlobes/white eggs . mar/apr issue i read article guinea hens . may/june issue i read letter reader ( dana manchester member guinea fowl breeders assoc . ) correcting article previous issue . apparently , guineas aren't " watch fowl " they portrayed , but fall victim predation often . dana manchester also corrected mislabeled photos guineas . these may small errors but how goods resource isn't reliable ? if errors only issues , i may given mag 3 stars but article manure management may/june issue lacking many levels . advise nutshell buy manure spreader you pull around your field , fill'er up drive . one word caution according article- only use well rotted manure garden , but there wasn't one word how rot manure . i liked article smaller breeds cattle , " bigger not better " may/june but we'll wait next issue see if any readers step forward corrections . i am not waiting around . there lot books magazines dedicated small farms . i like mother nature news i just subscribed countryside ( my nephew recommended it he owns small farm , well ) . i also like john seymour book self-sufficient life how live it . he upbeat attitude can-do spirit .	1

i am not alone here when i say knit ' style joke most knitters . myself my knitting friends agree it evidence someone , somewhere , seriously deluded if they think these patterns what average knitter yearning make . i can't help but believe if you can't get published worthwhile knitting magazine then you go knit ' style . because , seriously , they'll take anything try sell it poor unsuspecting knitters . save yourself money flip through this magazine if you see it shelf somewhere . you may get lucky find one pattern that worth making single issue ... but then again , you may not . i suggest interweave knits , family circle easy knits , or vogue knitting if you want patterns you'll actually want wear .	-1

unless you want editor liberal political views shoved down your throat , avoid this magazine . it leans left so hard you lie your side even read it . ( no , i am not republican or democrat , but independent who looks all sides ) . editor this magazine huge agenda get democrats back power , he bashes bush republican party over head 10-ton hammer monthly basis , yet worships eco-phonies like laurie david celebrities who want rest us drive eco-friendly cars while they fly world their private jets . ( i understand laurie her friends like sheryl crow " trying " wean themselves off this practice cutting down their private jet hopping trips wee bit using huge gas guzzling bus criss-crossing country instead , but poor laurie finding this hard give up . what hyprocrites these hollywood folks ! ) though i am personally trying my bit environment , i hate when i read issues like current " green " issue where these so called eco-environmentalists really only want us " common people " make changes . this used great fashion , entertainment current event magazine lot in-depth articles , but now it only political platform publication . i now just throw it away soon it arrives when i receive it , until my subscription expires	-1

cooking pleasures magazine magazine produced cooking club america . i very happily joined cooking club america , began receiving this magazine quite while ago . club offers so much its subscribers , but time wore , i could see marketing department tad too aggressive my taste . cooking club america offers their potential members numerous items entice them join . members take part member-only contests where kitchen products gift baskets some prizes . they sent food items or kitchen products review . they also receive cheese grater joining ! there some nice photographs this publication . recipes not complicated either , although they require some unusual ingredients some very expensive many people would find hard locate . i , personally , forego some recipes , others ; i order couple ingredients online , because reasons given . cheese grater sent you nice idea , but it rotary grater , you squeeze very hard get cheese grate . also , grater made plastic eventually snaps half after using it only handful times . club also offers you culinary resource directory . information contained this directory not difficult find basic internet search . you also receive standard sized blank recipe cards . unfortunately , due size recipe cards , i not believe anyone even write ingredients onto them without running out space . also , part member benefits sample products review . potential members see photographs blenders , ice cream makers much more . while member there three years , i opportunity review quick rise yeast chipotle spice . both nice products . they not glamorous photos kitchen appliances , but it something ! currently , they offering visa credit card their logo . this card , not only you use card like any other credit card , but also you receive club discounts . if this something appeals you , see club details . approximately 3 months after you renew your own subscription , they start mailing you how you should renew your membership following year now , so you help them keep club costs down . after just paying current year , i not interested paying year already . idea may not contact members so soon after they just paid their subscriptions . may save club some money . i caller id , i utilize it all time , screening my calls specifically avoid telemarketing calls . imagine my surprise when i pick up call it representative cooking club america . i , actually , pleasantly surprised , thinking i embark benefit member . i most disappointed hear mono-toned voice other end line , reading script , suggesting i become lifetime member now . when i tell them i am not interested , they " new " deal me . when i still tell them i am not interested , they yet deal . calls continued after this conversation couple months . this point , my subscription expired . i relieved telemarketing phone call really turned me off . you should there see me receive my credit card statement . cooking club america automatically charged my credit card my next subscription without my permission . it three months after my original subscription expired ! you imagine , this extremely upsetting . upon doing my research this article , i come find others similar experiences this magazine . it shame too , this magazine plenty potential . unfortunately , their marketing department could utilize different tactics maintaining their current membership . despite this magazine very affordable , i recommend you save your money this one try fine cooking , cuisine home or cook illustrated . not only these magazines provide better recipes , more professional tips , they also not call you daily get your money	-1

i used love light tasty , then they decided change look format , even though reader surveys said keep it same . new look hard read , lacks down-home feel makes magazines popular . there less pictures finished dishes , pictures they show smaller . they added full page ads thier country store products , which goes against no ad promise . i subscribed years , but this new look horrible . get it store see if you like it first	1

what it these gossip magazines ?? please tell me , because i truly think no one their right mind would ever subscribe this garbage . all it mindless crap media puts into kids minds , while not anything important else magazine . unless your 10 years old , not subscribe this . there better magazines out there fortunately , like seventeen cosmogirl ! which aren't nearly filled garbage like this . reason you don't see j-14 or this magazine or any other magazine like this top magazine list because it no effect people , it little kids it not mature . period .	-1
i must say i've read just every teen magazine market , this far worst one i've ever read . however , this point my life , everything appears superficial immature . i first picked up twist when it debuted newsstands . i believe august 1997 . i nine then , looking fashion forward among my girlfriends who still into jungle gym . because my insane desire cool , because twist wasn't too hard me understand , i loved it bought it religiously year . my obsession it slowly faded magazine got progressively worse i didn't pick it up again ...... until my junior year high school . looking through then-current issue magazine , i noticed way which it written made comprehensible nine year-old , or lowest common denomination older teenage readers . what i'm trying say this magazine totally dumbed-down . it doesn't give girls any credit able think creatively , let alone read above fourth-grade level . i also found content more childish superficial than other teen magazines ( although they all superficial extent - doesn't mean they don't make delightfully fun entertaining reading share friends ) . therefore , i recommend this magazine tweens ( 9-13 ) , tweens only . but even they better than this magazine . older readers should check out somewhat more sophisticated ' elle girl ' or ' cosmo girl ' , my two personal favorite s.p.s. i agree one other reviewers who pointed out numerous spelling errors magazine . possibly my biggest caveat constant misuse apostrophe ( i.e. tuesday instead tuesdays ) .	-1
i received this magazine gift ... i not renew . articles very short refer you websites , telephone numbers , etc . more information . why so little information magazine itself ? additionally , there load advertising : take out equation magazine would only few pages long . my money , there much more available elsewhere , including " google " search . waste paper , imho	-1

only reason i subscribe i found free subscription somewhere . magazine some interesting articles but most time they just completely wrong . one example preview last years nfl draft . they talked up terrell suggs long article point he definetely going latest third even quaterback needy bengals lions who really wanted rogers finding it hard take pass him . where he end up ? going baltimore ravens . not even his homestate team cardinals wanted him . example cover their college football preview . they picked auburn their national champions . i don't follow college football enough understand , but i know auburn lost its first two games doesn't look much like team vying national championship . i'm not saying sports illustrated perfect their picks always accurate , but they seem me get better grasp sports . yes sports illustrated ads , but looking through my last issue it doesn't seem sporting news any less . it takes while till you get least two consecutive non ad pages . it seems like they both same amount . even if one more ads than others it hard really turn page ? you lazy ? articles important thing not many people say ones sporting news better . i'd like hear what some people thought so nonsports related sports illustrated . i personally haven't seen anything non sports relat1ed . yes they reviews occasional sports themed book movie but they usually short just letting fans know whether its worth it	-1

christmas 2005 i decided i wanted most interesting best cooking magazines out there . but which ones pick ? after buying one here there i found three i absolutely love . saveur one . recipes nice though some i wouldn't touch ten foot pole ( ethnic ingredients don't appeal me ) . but stories pictures ... they aren't just amazing , they're astounding ! where national geographic talks certain things or places , saveur takes you different places shows you what there how they eat . they showed me ireland i even made colcannon ( mashed potato cabbage dish ) everyone loved it . i made french dish last night amazing . it little time consuming but worth it ! i admit i little disappointed my first issue i received them my subscription . it looked like dog ate it then ran through water it . it readable but i wasn't happy . they also promise two exclusive magazines new subscribers . i've never seen them . but i getting my magazines they look good . i thinking it other night , my three magazines i picked ... one articles recipes healthy eating ( eating well ) , one easier recipes no articles ( everyday food ) , then saveur . if i could only pick one keep ... it would saveur . it really good read .	1
you bet , this one . there only few mac oriented magazines out there they all wish they could this well written . this large format magazine each issue filled series how-to articles i consider best written , best illustrated easiest follow . i slog through some fairly dull reading but this magazine i would give my wife / daughter / co-worker explain how use ichat , hook up isight camera , customize ical , get started safari so . they review many new software tittles latest hardware goodies . since it magazine , reviews very current . each issue comes cd they starting include pdf copies prior issues , great reference	1
it true entrepreneur mag loaded ads -- but those ads interesting themselves . i always find it fascinating see what ads pop what ads junk -- it easy see difference . this opportunity develop your own advertising strategy ! content , there certainly room improvement . i personally enjoy entrepreneur profiles , though i wish they longer . i would like see more meat here . business several years now , i find most value this magazine comes front section where they list interesting tips , new products , survey results . not month goes i don't bookmark page so i follow up new product or check out website mentioned short piece . alone , low subscription price worth investmen t.t here lot information franchising , which great those interested this business model . though this not my personal cup tea , i still find it interesting read lists franchises notice trends popularity . who knew there so many pet service franchises available ! sure , it could use more real-world advice , but i still consider this one best general magazines available entrepreneurs . not every topic appeal every reader since we all run different kinds businesses seek different information . if you're looking something more specific your industry , trade magazine would make more sense . but i still recommend you keep your entrepreneur mag too so you keep eye climate small biz world .	1
i thought my first issue your magazine little sparse . it very thin issue . models beautiful . this good . but you knowif you would include more depth articlessuch really depth stuff skin hair . like i said before aging skin needs more it some things like micro-dermabrasion could helpful . also 8 glasses water day most helpful thing woman could herself . beside plastic surgery , theres not much them . but i saythis , enlarge lips i put vitamin capsule my lips , then honey then good lip moisturizer leave it overnight . it doees make lips plumper . also i use baby powder my face face powder . sometimes i use this just my nose chin . sometimes i use half mayonaise conditioner mix them together make mayonaise smell better hair . sometimes i use vitamin oil my bath water such vitamin person buy this dollar store . im not rich but i some things help way i look my age . then you could include pictures mountains rivers stories people . then you could articles celebrities like frank converse , robert blake , really interesting ones like . paul newman always got something say interesting . also what ever happened actor richard hatch who starred hitchhikers ? someone told me other day most handsome actor there or yul brynner . i didnt see i should . i dont know if you agree or not but it would interesting see profile way he lived . i like brad pitt those people always great . i love jennifer anniston because she she higher up than most women her thoughts actions . angelina jolie i really like too beacause women like these women . i miss johnny carson they really need find someone replace him . yes there people like still world . ive found some them . well thank you	1

i've subscribing paste over year now , it great magazine . i agree what others said writing : interviewers often seem love their subjects deal musicians fans instead journalists . there tons reviews each issue wide variety bands music , sampler cd dvd worth subscription price all themselves . it great way listen bands you would never heard otherwise . if you love music spending small fortune cds , this magazine you . my only real criticism magazine it very text heavy , tons small print jammed onto each page , often background picture/design behind words , which makes it chore read . i would love see larger print less eye junk pages . then again , i'm closing 40 so younger eyes may not find it problematic	1

world gaming , there specialized magazines each system ( playstation magazine , xbox mag , etc . ) , most which suck because they only report ( duh ) games their respective systems . others , like electronic gaming monthly , encompass most systems but only it half-assed , not really giving you anything make you think highly it . then , there gameinformer . there many things set gameinformer apart many other " gaming " magazines : 1 ) they completely unbiased opinions games they play . if game sucks , they say so ; if it awesome game , they'll tell you it . 2 ) matt helgeson ( senior gaming editor ) other editors actually inform you game most necessary attributes : its esrb rating ( ) , their rating game ( 1 10 ) , brief introduction game faults successes . best all , however , they include screenshots game- most screenshots rock . these just some reasons gameinformer magazine absolute best gaming magazine market . i subscription this magazine this magazine only , i hope my review explained why .	1

i subscribed details because i'm interested male psyche . i also like looking male celebrity pictures guy models ads . its not most politically correct article planet , one last page called " gay or ...? " which writer tries uncover if certain type person gay or not , no conclusion actually ever given so i suppose its reader decide . its very stereotypical part magazine , but beyond there cool articles read male perspectives . i also enjoy reading celebrity interviews , addition they include interviews female celebrities . i don't agree everything printed here , but certain articles made me think i've actually gotten lot out it . it helps me understand guys i agree certain opinions . mag leans toward liberal unabashed its attitude so . i like it lot , it may not everyone that fine .	1
man this it , great mag cool business people . what you not know , you after reading all this great info . read !!	1
i've subscriber over fifteen years , probably continue subscribe until day i die . but times i find national geographic frustrating . i no interest soccer , nor i want huge fold-out map discussing sport . aren't there more phenomenal things going world today ? also , geographic its pet topics . how many articles must we read pandas ? dozen ? i like pandas , believe me , but surely there other less cute animals discuss . also i could without lectures pc environmental propaganda . articles oil-drilling alaska filled thinly veiled agenda which preachy annoying . yeah , we get it , you don't want alaska drilled . we move , please ? other articles quite interesting . i enjoy zip code discussion , old-fashioned pictures , articles countries . i could fewer articles underwater archaeology though , articles filled preachy environmentalist scolding gets boring . friend mine ( joe average type guy ) , said he stopped subscribing geographic because articles depressing him . i tried argue him , because i think magazine great- but i kind agree , topics late downbeat aren't particularly uplifting . i believe magazine getting little ' out there ' its choice topics , too . i recommend this magazine those interested environment world around them	1

i heard " books culture . " i never read it . then good friend college called one afternoon told me he sending me gift subscription . i've never enjoyed periodical this much . it given me hope . when george . bush reelected word " evangelical " spoken across country blame . regardless your political stance , point evangelicals seen stupid enough reelect what much rest nation saw poor president . even today , " evangelical " often used connote backwardness or stupidity . but " books culture " blows this assumption out water . you stumbled across publication voice god-fearing perspectives gender roles church , current philosophy theology , current film literature , politics , economics , cultural phenomena such internet ? this " books culture " most recent issue , thoughtfully honestly written , even when conclusions reached seem somewhat outside traditional conception things . subculture , we love answers . but it seems we entering new period growth our communities , one which questions equally important appropriately valued . why not begin tough questions ? you'll find many them " books culture . " p.s. dennis , if you ever read this , thanks subscription , bud .	1
there certainly lot hate wine spectator - , matter , wine advocate . many winemakers decry existence both magazines , usually lay blame entirely robert parker doorstep making 100-point rating system industry standard . wine spectator scores gotten better time , their articles . they've shied away california " glitz " looked more into food . also , education classes they list their website becoming increasingly more helpful . apparently they listened much criticism worked toward creating more respected magazine . i think they've well .	1
this light colorful newspaper . i remember when it first came out . idea it would national newspaper cover united states whole . it way gives local news regards all ' sections ' country . reporting itself clear very readable . paper lacks weight depth . it lot variety its features , clearly attempts entertain reader somehow make news more palatable . it not great newspaper but it often features fine reporting . there times when it better job than more prestigious papers .	1
whether you technical guru or someone who emphasis words , any serious filmmaker who takes his or her craft seriously love american cinematographer . official magazine american society cinematographers , this magazine gives you depth interviews dps directors technical approach towards shooting picture . they cover not just lab soups lighting techniques , but also approach script , design notes how visually approach script - other words , great detailed overview how this particular crew filmmakers went creating visual language film . not just film - technology advances , more films shot video , this magazine gives same great coverage those pictures well - star wars anniversary party . while it true there only so many films ac cover each issue but i think you'll end up feeling like i - i wish they could cover them all	1
two years ago , i became subscriber shape , mainly because i received it free part package deal magazine . i always liked browsing through issues shape supermarket , i thought subscriber would help support my fitness goals . overall , i enjoyed shape found it useful , but there definitely some negatives , magazine might not everyone . but first good . like many others mentioned , what i most enjoy shape their real-life weight stories featuring nice variety women , some whom actually needed * gain * weight order healthy . i also love their relatively new feature which they follow one their own staffers year-long weight loss journey . many their other regular features also excellent , particularly body part-focused strength exercises other how-to exercise guides . i especially like shape uses " reader models " so many their articles -- real life women various ages ( although admittedly , mostly 25-35 range ) normal , healthy , strong bodies . finally , their featured exercise plans each month often offer some unique variations traditional exercises , recipes often quite good well . main negative already brought up many others here : use too-skinny , not overtly fit or strong models illustrate much magazine . i find this extremely disappointing ; i understand sell magazines , models probably conform some traditional standards attractiveness , but those us buying magazine want see women who not only fit but also strong -- show us some muscles now then ! i said above , reader models great ; women usually quite fit , but they muscles curves too , which wonderful see . shape may trying make some improvements this area , last few covers featured famous women who exercise ( such denise richards ) , but they still long way go . while they're it , i hope they return their cover models dress fitness wear , not bathing suits ! they still show off their model physique showcase cute fitness wear same time . similarly , i would like see magazine get rid fashion segment end * unless * they start focusing it exercise clothing , not haute couture . if you overweight and/or new exercising , you may find magazine discouraging , but if you get past some negatives , it also inspiring . i think it up each individual determine whether magazine like this likely hurt or help her fitness efforts ; me , it helpful , but this definitely might not case everyone	1

before i begin , there one thing you need know : i can't cook . i skills can't beaten when it comes heating stuff microwave , i use toaster oven , uh , toast things , but that it . no whipping up any fancy 30-minute meals me , which probably makes me only person who can't cook who actually buys this magazine . this should say great deal just how entertaining every day rachael ray actually . course , you might expect , i like rachael ray . it really would weird someone buy this magazine if they didn't cook they also hated rachael , i'm not weird ! however , although this ostensibly cooking-centric magazine , i'd argue it really reflects rachael attitude personality . her enthusiasm , love wide variety food , adventurous spirit shine through every page . all reports , rachael very hands-on developing this magazine , it shows . those who ask why they need read rachael ray magazine , since rachael all over television these days ( most recently her own syndicated daytime talk show ) , chew this : rachael isn't taking over world accident . she obviously doing something right dominating both food network daily schedule bestseller lists ( her ever-increasing line cookbooks ) . people just can't get their fill her ! so , what exactly her secret ? i think it boils down these factors : combination approachability charisma , which key ingredients superstardom ( think talented-yet-friendly stars such tom hanks or shakira ) . add dash optimism mixed spirit adventure , witnessed my favorite ray show , " $40 day , " which she explores new tourist destination each week , trying eat well insanely low budget . but what rachael ray magazine form , you're wondering ? well , my opinion , every day rachael ray appeals all tastes brilliantly translating her unique appeal tv screen printed page . i mentioned earlier , i probably won't cooking anything many recipes included each issue , but i still like checking them out . each recipe includes picture finished product , recipes lots variety creativity ... yum-o ! some so simple , like sandwiches or salads , i get feeling i might actually able attempt them if i really wanted ( see ? rachael " can-do " attitude even gets through kitchen-incompetent ! ) travel articles short pieces ( wide range topics such buying cheese , making mistakes kitchen , etc . ) also fun . but , rachael fan , i especially enjoy parts magazine written , or , rachael . one nice feature which readers send questions rachael which she personally answers . someone who participated lot " celebrity a " online past , i love these chances get know more someone famous who you may never meet person . fact , only reason i haven't rated every day rachael ray " five stars " because i'd like see even more rachael-related photos articles each issue ... how cool would ?! also , i'm hungry more interactivity : perhaps some food-themed sudoku , or some search-a-words . but fair , this relatively new magazine , all great magazines need time sort out what doesn't work . so far , every day rachael ray hit ground running off great start . i actually first person buy very first issue my local bookstore when it came out ( i got lucky happened there they set up display ) , i've looked forward each new issue ever since day . if you like rachael ray , you can't go wrong here ... start spending every day rachael ray " take bite outta life . " even if you can't boil water !	1

american spectator must read anyone considering themselves intellectual . not only articles witty well-researched , they also provide well-articulated arguments most pressing ( if sometimes slighlty out date ) controversies times . well worth subscription price , or even cover price	1
this most accurate geo-political socio-economic english-language news-weekly there . period . articles succinct , top-notch , cover everything world today business , economics environment . i think magazine tends focus bit too little environment religion , but my perception . despite editorial style very sophisticated diction , articles still easy understand . true , this magazine ( or newspaper , it calls itself ) staunchly pro-democracy ( i.e. broadly speaking , anti-russian policy , anti-chinese policy their respective conflicts , say , over georgia or taiwan , pro-war iraq issue ) , pro-free trade , pro-european ( i.e. expansion eu ) . but it takes many conservative liberatarian positions , too , oftentimes even liberal ones , which , overall , makes magazine fairly objective - you'll usually get all or most points-of-view after reading just few articles same subject , although economist usually imply , or sometimes downright state , which position it takes or world must take . actually that best part : it very refreshing magazine not afraid share its opinion offer its advice readers , hence its influence . this , me , icing cake . economics international relations student , i receiving economist some three years already . short time span , it source -- usually main source -- dozens my essays country reports ( country or topical surveys published every several weeks excellent this ! ) reading magazine increased my english vocabulary significantly . i finally feel my vocabulary increased third-grade level college-level . yes , it indeed take few weeks get used unique writing style , but magazine indispensible . some it may appear arrogant , which what i tend sense times , but not mean it bad magazine . quite simply , it tends think itself sophisticated , rightfully so . while half-owned financial times , many economist authors also write latter , which help explain while two similar . but while financial times daily newspaper fairly brief articles 50-50 slant news finance/business , economist articles , while also succinct , focus everything world impacts people . why it excellent summary world this week those people little time their hands . finally , i not necessarily sense anti-semitic slant stated one previous review . yes , i am jewish , but i tend regard economist proposed solutions -- such dealing hamas politically ( despite their " militancy " ) , they cannot destroyed -- middle east conflict mere pragmatism work . same its proposal legalize various drugs . not both these things ever happen today world ( mid-east conflict won't end ; drugs won't decriminalized most countries ) , but thinking purely pragmatic , which refreshing world so increasingly bent political correctness . this respect , aforementioned ones , i feel magazine lot more objective overall than many others , despite specific positions it takes particular articles . it makes truly fascinating read . it most surely investment it claims , so any those any remaining doubts , $129 subscription price ($77 students ) more than worth it . just read three or four issues you'll see . trust me	1
this magazine great recipies ! most them incredibly easy , but there few " adventuresome " ones every once while try when you feel up challenge . sometimes recipies need few more spices , so i usually add more than they say ( heck , it doesn't change calorie count ) . however , cooking light not trade calories taste , so whole family likes meal there many recipies i would proudly serve company ( majority , fact ) . there also just ton recipies per issue . only negative things i would say few recipies only marginally " healthy " sometimes there some redundancy . overall , it great buy	1

people most incredible magazine . writers magazine know exactly what you want read subscriber , but there always extra section just not interest you because no magazine attract every ones personal interests . no matter what this magazine always makes friday great day . i feel best part people magazine fact they give you special issues , like 50 most beautiful people , sexiest man alive , eligible bachelor . you get variety highlights each people issue . you find inside each issue many sections pertaining your interest . section called mailbox where you get read other people responses articles last issue released . passage page where they give you all details celebrities such marriages , births , divorces , deaths , injured , or convicted . finally , i love getting toward end magazine just able read true crime stories because they intriguing quite interesting . only bad part people magazine most people , just like myself , buy issues read celebrities . but you also get human interest stories which don't seem interest everyone . now i not subscription , but i read every issue , whether i buy them myself or read magazine work . i would say if you wanted purchase magazine this would great one choose because magazine reaches out any one their teenage years up	1

" discipleship journal " what many other christian magazines not . it provides instruction , challenges reader directly fully engaged christ-focused faith . while others may talk christianity , dj asks you pursue christ through responding scripture . this isn't evangelistic magazine , like " decision , " or encouraging magazine , per se , like " moody . " it christian looking grow his or her faith examining themselves what god word says . it not passive pew sitter . this christian who wants his or her faith impact days sundays . there nothing watered-down here . it published navpress , who , like their counterparts , college ministry navigators , know crucial necessity biblical study everyday christian . whether it discussion satan favorite lies , how study particular book bible , or explanation what prayer not , dj sort publication cause you pause mid-page realize something new our lord his ways . this great tool two or three people use together . even small group ... go through articles , week week discuss them what this means real life . i've even heard ccd sunday school classes asking everyone read selections certain issue fodder next week class . i fully recommend " discipleship journal .

years i taken this magazine , i noted often covered material becomes tomorrow news latest hot-spot world . so prescient , it eery - if you any interest current events , news or foreign affairs , this journal must read . contributors who who politics , science business world . often author list become under-secretary state list next administration . example , last issue discussed avian flu virus . physician , i tell you these excellent informative articles explained clearly what happening what danger . now this stuff tv every day i amaze my patients how much i know issue no one else . reading this definitely make you look smart . try this experiment see if i'm right . this article written october 2005 , days after receiving october issue multiple articles china written chinese authors . course means these articles aren't really useful facts so much they useful seeing what china wants us believe . i predict china much more news next 6 12 months . so put this magazine test see . one negative although authors bi-partisan regarding party , they not " conservative " . you won't ever find pro-tariff , anti illegal immigration , isolationist , anti judicial activism or pro-life articles here . indeed , regardless which party author supports , you pretty much count expanded government , especially one-world government presented solution . lastly , some articles deadly boring contain stilted , obfuscated , diplomatic jargon . you rarely find simple , eloquent phrase , but you often find ideas pop up any analysis news . just realize many these authors diplomats politicians whose careers depend obfuscation plausible deniability . all all , this extremely influential journal full cutting-edge ideas . just realize many them may wrong	1

when funds tight i difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions keep . each women magazine slightly different feel writing , though increased competition , these styles seem flux . i finally decided i preferred writing bazaar getting tired what i felt vogue cosmopolitan attempt catch larger readership ( if i want subscribe cosmo , i'll bloody well subscribe ) . featured designers more cutting edge less mainstream than what found vogue . it bit snottier ( though there far snottier magazines if you looking extreme fashions ) . among my complaints : bazaar obviously thinner magazine , while most vogue content adverts , it seem more articles . item i find highly irritating , bazaar society items . i really don't give ---- who wearing what what charity gala , especially when i don't play footsies these people . those complaints aside , this still my favorite fashion magazine	1

someone who recently become more interested healthier , organic way life , i decided check out several magazines subject matter . many not strike my fancy . example , i found organic style magazine little too fashion product-oriented my taste , while mind , body , spirit fitness seems little too redundant doesn't cover natural organic living all . natural health , however , falls somewhere , covering nice array topics including fitness/diet , natural remedies , beauty , food/recipes . someone who not interested explicitly holistic medicine naturopathy , i appreciate diversity this magazine offer . though many articles cover ideas products aren't entirely natural or organic , i still find them useful . many items articles , though not all , vegetarian-friendly well eco-conscious , which i appreciate . one my few complaints articles short , sometimes merely " glossing over " many topics . however , if one piques my interest , it decent jumping off point further research . though i can't compare previous version magazine everyone else seems preferred , i only began pick this up my local whole foods market last year , i say i am impressed what natural health offer it readers . sure , there several ads plaguing pages , but i still feel though there far fewer advertisements than many magazines shelves today . besides , some ads led me decent products i would not known otherwise . furthermore , this price , how anyone really go wrong	1

i agree this magazine boasts designer clothing extremely high prices most people cannot afford , but may people aware this magazine called " teen vogue " obviously follow it big sister footsteps . " vogue " not feature clothes walmart , so " teen vogue " not either . this magazine not necessarily cater only rich people . who says person should only buy magazine when she going get exact clothes featured it ? i am definitely no millionaire . i'm 16 years old still high school , but i enjoy this magazine immensely . course i dont slip out marc jacobs when i'm reading get myself shirt page 79 , but i look styles so i understand new trends just inspire myself some . magazines dont always realistic . fashion pursuing beauty covetting beauty , if all magazines only featured " affordable clothes ' walmart old navy , well .. i really wouldnt know what would like . " teen vogue " pure fashion magazine . it isnt all-round magazine young girls . it only fashion . it great job what it strives . fashion great taste great , shoots amazing . former reviewer reccomended " seventeen " i want note " seventeen " different type magazine entirely . seventeen extremely mainstream bubblegum not very fashion orientated . personally i not like magazine but i'm not going condemn it here . " teen vogue " classy , stylish , lives up it name . you dont rich kid read this magazine . but it only teen magazine out there which dedicated souly high fashion yes , features best fashion . people who not interested fashion probably hate this magazine , probably why it recieved so much criticism . i , other hand , love this magazine . only reason i didnt give it five stars because reviews above deemed stuff it affordable young girls strike me ridiculous . otherwise , look this magazine some fantastic fashion inspiration	1

revolver competing magazines heavy metal magazine world hit parader circus . i bought all three these magazines several times , revolver my final judgement revolver only magazine good enough subscribe . other two i still buy occasionally , but only wallpaper ( i cut out pictures bands magazines hang them my room . ) this magazine , way , like combination circus blender magazines ; it combines best aspects both . revolver still plenty great pictures , but it also much longer much better written than circus . it not quite long or stuffed full information blender , but make sure you note revolver only reports one genre ( heavy metal ! ) whereas blender could ( theoretically ) report every genre ( rap , pop , rock , etc . ) chances , if hard rock band ( especially big name hard rock band ) or already released c.d. , revolver story it . stories/reports very entertaining but they also informative sometimes lesson learned them . if it cover story , interview band also included ; if it not cover story , writer integrates quotes answers band into article , anyways ( even though it not formal interview ) . revolver writers frequently go tour band ( i.e. lamb god ) . case , they take reader backstage , tour bus , concert ( rundown show ) . when i first started reading this magazine , there sexual theme it . there would picture " hot babe " t-shirt , one side poster would woman-usually half-naked-in sexual pose . past year or so , revolver phased out ( probably appeal broader audience ) . i sometimes miss pictures " hot babes , " but this way there more room real heavy metal pictures . yet , even though sex isn't theme anymore , revolver probably bit too sophisticated anyone younger than teenager . plus , there usually profanities ( mainly " word . " ) so , i would say this magazine ages 13 up . monthly articles : -cover story-3 or 4 other biggish stories- " fresh blood " column ( where small biography given band you probably haven't heard of)- ask vinnie ( column where readers write questions , pantera/damageplan drummer vinnie paul gives advice)- hard rock news notes- black death metal news notes- " studio " ( update bands currently recording new music)-free poster ( middle magazine , there fold-out poster one or two bands . ) poster isn't very wide , but it two pages long-free music downloads- " ink spot " ( story musician favorite tattoo)- " favorite sh*t " ( interview musician , questions such " what your favorite color ? " )-joke band ( revolver just recently started doing this)- reviews ( reviews . . ' , music dvd , video games)pros : -- plenty good pictures free poster -- professionally written well known writers ( yet it not too intelligent teenagers) -- edited well ( i haven't found any mistakes or typos)-the " fresh blood " column usually introduces me band i haven't heard , but i should probably check out -- revolver accredited well known enough allowed go tours bands first interviews -- news columns ( both mainstream underground metal bands)-the stories always quotes band report -- free music ! ( revolver started doing page gives reader password , which he/she then access free music downloads online . ) -- no stupid questions interviews ( they ask up date questions , sometimes- i.e. interview puddle mudd-the writers aren't afraid ask daring , cutting questions) -- " studio " segment always informative -- helpful , reliable reviews ( they don't automatically praise every heavy metal . . ) cons : -- if you're up date your music news web sites , news columns shouldn't really anything new you . -- not all . . ' reviewed ( they give rundown c.d. article band , but . . ' bands cover magazine aren't usually reviewed . ) -concerts aren't reviewed-my biggest gripe it only issued once month . bottom line , if you're metalhead , this best magazine you get ! it more than well worth ten dollars you spend years worth entertainment	1
... while , yes , i've made comments past how oprah changed little , this publication . i'm sure person who wrote " this just magazine full things one can't afford " reads fashion or celebrity magazines full many things she can't afford . advertising generates money , while i don't like ads either , they everywhere because advertising works . if you don't want see them , don't buy magazines , watch tv or go anywhere . far layouts " too full clutter " ... everyone their own style . there some people who like look don't prefer pared-down , zen look . magazines not reality . if they , they wouldn't plastered plastic , bronzed 6 ' females who weigh 100 lbs . i'm originally middle america , nobody looks like there . just take magazines ads what they . save your money , like i , things you just . if you don't perserverence , then stick target walmart circulars . knock-offs never far behind .	1

this most accurate geo-political socio-economic english-language news-weekly there . period . articles succinct , top-notch , cover everything world today business , economics environment . i think magazine tends focus bit too little environment religion , but my perception . despite editorial style very sophisticated diction , articles still easy understand . true , this magazine ( or newspaper , it calls itself ) staunchly pro-democracy ( i.e. broadly speaking , anti-russian policy , anti-chinese policy their respective conflicts , say , over georgia or taiwan , pro-war iraq issue ) , pro-free trade , pro-european ( i.e. expansion eu ) . but it takes many conservative liberatarian positions , too , oftentimes even liberal ones , which , overall , makes magazine fairly objective - you'll usually get all or most points-of-view after reading just few articles same subject , although economist usually imply , or sometimes downright state , which position it takes or world must take . actually that best part : it very refreshing magazine not afraid share its opinion offer its advice readers , hence its influence . this , me , icing cake . economics international relations student , i receiving economist some three years already . short time span , it source -- usually main source -- dozens my essays country reports ( country or topical surveys published every several weeks excellent this ! ) reading magazine increased my english vocabulary significantly . i finally feel my vocabulary increased third-grade level college-level . yes , it indeed take few weeks get used unique writing style , but magazine indispensible . some it may appear arrogant , which what i tend sense times , but not mean it bad magazine . quite simply , it tends think itself sophisticated , rightfully so . while half-owned financial times , many economist authors also write latter , which help explain while two similar . but while financial times daily newspaper fairly brief articles 50-50 slant news finance/business , economist articles , while also succinct , focus everything world impacts people . why it excellent summary world this week those people little time their hands . finally , i not necessarily sense anti-semitic slant stated one previous review . yes , i am jewish , but i tend regard economist proposed solutions -- such dealing hamas politically ( despite their " militancy " ) , they cannot destroyed -- middle east conflict mere pragmatism work . same its proposal legalize various drugs . not both these things ever happen today world ( mid-east conflict won't end ; drugs won't decriminalized most countries ) , but thinking purely pragmatic , which refreshing world so increasingly bent political correctness . this respect , aforementioned ones , i feel magazine lot more objective overall than many others , despite specific positions it takes particular articles . it makes truly fascinating read . it most surely investment it claims , so any those any remaining doubts , $129 subscription price ($77 students ) more than worth it . just read three or four issues you'll see . trust me	1
i could not carry life i know it without economist . no hype . it good . this american reviewer became hopelessly addicted economist news analysis during four years england . magazine - or ' newspaper ' , it stubbornly insists calling itself - published london , though 2005 largest national readership united states . editorial line libertarian more moderate european sense word . essential values individual liberty , modest state , free market economics . don't let name fool you . this weekly far more than economist rag . its anonymous writing current events if fabulous , not mention top-ranked analysis letters , arts , like . let me give you concrete example how economist excels . years , i paid close attention its coverage latino immigration issues usa . one might suppose british magazine would disadvantage when exploring this complex topic , yet economist coverage routinely surpasses us newspapers magazines , perhaps largely because its disdain self-suppressing ' pc ' tactics . only area which i detect broad deficiency this magazine coverage role religion , particularly america . secularist european spectacles its editors wear seem make it impossible them canvass this phenomenon view religion continued fervor advanced western nations something other than retrograde slightly amusing . i tell my university-age nephews - thankfully , they ask - anchor their news consumption one weekly , then read widely beyond it . economist very best anchor available english-reading sailors	1

i subscribed multiple photography magazines first when i started getting serious photography . i subscribed ' photography ' ' american photo ' this one , popular photography imaging . three this magazine most balanced amount reviews , ' how tos ' , digital imaging related topics ( photoshop , etc ) well some nice contests . also they seem sponsor more ' mentor series ' type products where you go some locale shoot photos reasonable fee . all magazines this also something important me - half magazine isn't ads . photography worst offender this , there'd 50 or so pages weak articles , then 50 pages solid ads . while this one chunk ads near back , it still ' back page ' article articles mixed among ads . only 25% magazine advertisements . they also support nice online website ( popphoto.com ) forum where people logon ask questions . while not heavily trafficked say dpreview.com authors editors read respond questions . overall great magazine hobby	1
yes - there tons great shots mag ; great articles ( french only ) , contests --- very chic .... however ---- customer service treat you like redheaded stepchild when you ask them " why you not sent me latest issue photo ?? " .... you know it happen . they only send you sporadic issues when they feel like it ( or so it would seem ) ... most issues available stand weeks before you get yours delivered via mail ( should it other way around ??? ) they wont give you courtesy letter/postcard telling you when your subscription up ... that you figure out . so if you deal lame french hold music when you call photo cutomers service constantly , this great magazine ..... cough ... cough ... vive la france !	1
i only got first issue , but it seems focused more poets than other writers ( hence name ) . i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction . they might well keep two separate , especially contests events . it attractive format very upscale , high quality literature reviews advice . stories well written enjoyable , although i think writers digest offers more fiction writers	1
atlantic classic cultural , political literary voice america . first published team included legendary icons such ralph waldo emerson , oliver wendell holmes henry wadsworth longfellow , this periodical went include articles great historical figures such mark twain , woodrow wilson martin luther king jr. it may hard place current contributors next those specific individuals who came before them , but they stand tall contemparies published similar venues . this not magazine those who currently feel they well enough informed current crop " news-tainment " programs , talking heads mouthpieces found air waves today . here you'll find in-depth , critical analysis intelligent literature . you disagree some points view might you feel compelled label something it pages conservative or liberal ? maybe , but it understandable today climate . i would suggest you'd probably trying too hard , perhaps unconsciously , fit authors articles into particular partisan column . letters editor tend highlight differing points view so i encourage you read back following month see how others respond get feel magazine . i think most reasonable people tend find this magazine well worth time read regularly . recently there usually one full length article related issue middle east each month , which should expected current events , but content varies significantly within each issue you won't feel overwhelmed . there regular sections columns ranging travel book reviews fiction " post mortem " profiling some notable world figure who recently passed away . way comparison , harper new yorker probably closest style , though new yorker comes out weekly ( mostly ) instead monthly ( mostly ) like atlantic harper . if you're trying decide three , pick up each them two or three months see which you like best . i prefer atlantic overall , but if i time , i may pick up one or other if some particular topic it particularly interest me . bottom line , you could lot worse than subscribe atlantic	1
this monthly magazine opinionated breath fresh air . it philosophically allied libertarianism , but it not extreme or strident . reason more mainstream moderate than left or right ; it really political common sense . i don't always agree articles , but i rarely object reasoning supports them . point view isn't beholden agendas or special interests , read reason .	1
reason cannot labeled conservative or leftist . nor it extremist libertarian magazine like liberty , fawning over ayn rand . it bases its commentary assumption , if we some faith , our chaotic culture lead somewhere good . but if we try monitor control it excessively , we dampen human creativity end up muddled conflicted . reason takes all aspects culture assumes international perspective . its arguments laid out carefully but contain percolating sense indignation our increasingly repressive environment . same time , they more informative than polemical ; each report grounded specifics - quotes , anecdotes , studies . this most intelligent inquiring " political " journal available . if only it came out more often	1
i really like fact publishers really listen their readers . every year ( or it twice year ? ) there survey included magazine people give their opinions articles they enjoy those they would rather without . i've reading this past 2 years my local bookstore ( finally subscribed earlier this year ) . i've seen improvement not only magazine layout , but content well . i really like how there " sections " personal well-being , fashion , motherhood , etc . since i'm not parent ( yet ) , i easily skip over motherhood section . because layout , it not hard flip through find what i'm looking	1
friend mine told me " fast company " year ago , i subscriber avid reader since then . magazine enigmatic , combining news magazine , cultural commentary , business reporting , entrepreneurial insights into one publication . many issues deserve five star rating , but occasionally cohesion editorial focus bit uneven . thing i most like " fast company " 21st century approach news analysis : it thought provoking , explores all sides complex issues , but never tries tell reader what think . perfect example this april , 2006 issue article " al jazeera ( global ) mission , " which former us marine now working english-language version al jazeera profiled extremely multi-faceted story . entrepreneurial bent magazine great younger managers small business professionals , reporting market trends second none . although there times i don't agree articles or editorials " fast company , " i always find them intellectually stimulating thought provoking . i recommend this magazine independent thinkers everywhere	1

two years ago , i became subscriber shape , mainly because i received it free part package deal magazine . i always liked browsing through issues shape supermarket , i thought subscriber would help support my fitness goals . overall , i enjoyed shape found it useful , but there definitely some negatives , magazine might not everyone . but first good . like many others mentioned , what i most enjoy shape their real-life weight stories featuring nice variety women , some whom actually needed * gain * weight order healthy . i also love their relatively new feature which they follow one their own staffers year-long weight loss journey . many their other regular features also excellent , particularly body part-focused strength exercises other how-to exercise guides . i especially like shape uses " reader models " so many their articles -- real life women various ages ( although admittedly , mostly 25-35 range ) normal , healthy , strong bodies . finally , their featured exercise plans each month often offer some unique variations traditional exercises , recipes often quite good well . main negative already brought up many others here : use too-skinny , not overtly fit or strong models illustrate much magazine . i find this extremely disappointing ; i understand sell magazines , models probably conform some traditional standards attractiveness , but those us buying magazine want see women who not only fit but also strong -- show us some muscles now then ! i said above , reader models great ; women usually quite fit , but they muscles curves too , which wonderful see . shape may trying make some improvements this area , last few covers featured famous women who exercise ( such denise richards ) , but they still long way go . while they're it , i hope they return their cover models dress fitness wear , not bathing suits ! they still show off their model physique showcase cute fitness wear same time . similarly , i would like see magazine get rid fashion segment end * unless * they start focusing it exercise clothing , not haute couture . if you overweight and/or new exercising , you may find magazine discouraging , but if you get past some negatives , it also inspiring . i think it up each individual determine whether magazine like this likely hurt or help her fitness efforts ; me , it helpful , but this definitely might not case everyone	1

self-diagnosed christianity today junkie , i cannot speak highly enough christianity today thoughtful comprehensive resource anyone interested christian faith . ct brainchild billy graham fifty years ago , it maintains his strain christian perspective , namely evangelicalism . graham never interested preacher answering every bit theological doctrinal minutiae , nor christianity today aim so . instead , this magazine truly covers full spectrum issues impact lives christians , news stories current events biographies leaders within church analyses important social spiritual matters controversial battles ( past present ) . ct offers genuinely global perspective christianity , telling missionary stories around world each issue . there stories successful thriving churches every stripe descriptions victories successes occur within all sorts denominations ecclesiastical organizations . they periodically include debates or discussions opposing sides important theological ideas , offering folks both sides forum state their case . one things i appreciate most christianity today their passion journalism right way christians . they publish articles writers whom many their readers not necessarily agree , they chronicle lives many folks who may outside church or least affiliated fringe movement . they all this while maintaining unabashedly clear evangelical center , which most clearly communicated through editorials each issue . i love heart this magazine its leadership . i love their approach their charge evangelical christian journalists . i truly read each issue , cover cover , including all advertisements even classified ads ! i feel like i remain well-educated informed christian when i immerse myself this amazing resource . i find myself copying or forwarding links least one or two articles each issue friends family whose lives i know touched mine always when i invest reading pages christianity today . i would recommend it anyone .	1

me , september issue vogue , its 700 page issue , more than eye candy . it art . it simple . i no longer look most fashion magazine , nor models , realistic , something ever transfer into my own life , nor would i want it . it reminds me trips art museums where i admire one painting half afternoon , but it doesn't mean i want it hanging my wall home . vogue photography exquiste , pure art . glossy pages , vibrant , sometimes muted colors , seem jump off page . images make my mind wander explore . when i finally got over ridiculous prices more ridiculously thin models legs longer than i am tall , i able fully appreciate artistry ads fashion spreads . i find ads engaging fashion spreads , which good thing , magazine least half ads . some articles good well . i skip over few society articles , i've surprised number well-written pieces apply average well-educated , sophisticated person . no , cosmo readers most likely won't find much vogue , but i'd say women over 30 , who relatively world-wise , find articles geared toward them . overall , vogue high end publication high end photographers produces rather sweet eye candy some decent non-fashion articles	1

harper , like atlantic new yorker written those looking more in-depth analysis coverage political cultural affairs sampling serious literary prose . personally i prefer atlantic , which i read regularly , only picking up harper when i time something it interests me , which usually two or three times year . just looking cover pages inside convey harper serious tome , perhaps too serious casual reader , especially compared more colorful pages atlantic playful new yorker cartoons . nevertheless , harper american icon it genre published many articles great names since it inception 1850 . number reviewers complain it left leaning stance clearly sprouts now recently departed editor lewis lapham , who outspoken critic current administration . mr. lapham shares his views two page opinion piece full page listing various " fun facts " known harper index . serious readers able get beyond this simply " viewpoint " see entire magazine serious writing it . i would contend this represents best " critical analysis " rather than bias . i would also simply suggest you view other reviews made people espousing this periodical overly biased . instance , least one those claiming liberal bias here also praising ann coulter book . so if you feel underwhelmed typical content you get even 60 minute broadcast or political round table free-for-all you're interested enough this magazine read it reviews , you should probably pick up copy it two or three months give it try . i recommend you also check out new yorker atlantic compare	1

someone who reads lot magazines who left-liberal , i remain stalwart supported new republic . this despite fact , yes , they supported iraq war . their crucial failing enterprise they assumed bush would work democrats , etc ., actually get job . it easy anti-war left bash them after fact , but least you say they take moral ethical high road : they've advocating military intervention humanitarian grounds years , even if , case iraq , they made many mistakes , fact they represent american left willing intervene non-self-interested grounds important itself . many people suggested tnr steadily moved right under tenure martin peretz , but they remain committed some most important issues american liberals : universal health care , gay rights ( their most conservative editor , after all , andrew sullivan , openly gay republican ) progressive economics . jonathan chait probably best political-economics journalist working us today . yes , they decidedly centrist , yes , they feature large number conservative writers , finally yes , they unapologetically pro-israeli middle east issues which puts off american college left , but their analysis top notch , their reporting incredibly insightful , despite no longer " in-flight reading air force one , " they remain indispensable anyone wanting understand washington elite . arts front they're even more consistent : stanley kaufmann film criticism insightful top-notch ; i wish they more robert brustein theater , though least you give them credit national magazine which still drama desk . jed perl often insufferable his art criticism , but he very smart engaging . leon wieseltier , literary editor , one i like least , he given long , wincingly verbose pieces ( rarely books ) , but he one eminences grise american literary criticism . more engaging controversial james wood , whose occasional fiction reviews absolutely worth reading ; again , i rarely agree him , but he indispensable . just because you agree believer more doesn't make them more interesting read . basically , tnr great anyone who actually interested what going wants intellectually challenged ; end , i rarely outright agree their writers , but unlike nation or mother jones , they don't bother preaching choir , writing much better ( end , i only kept my nation subscription going arthur . danto occasional art pieces ) .	1

like my fellow choc-o-holic white brother , floyd garage , i too get weird sometimes disgusted looks some lame pastyfaced , flatbacked white girl counter . what i when i put my " black men " or " king " magazine down counter make comments like ...

... it also one things makes me think home when i am not there . definitve style music market , while most music mags focus musical genre or particular target audience , lets any music or artist ounce talent or credibility their prize . this end they featured musical interviews everyone madonna leonard cohen , blur george michael . breadth incredible , journalistic style artistic grittily honest . interest need share subject sound talent endless . only musical snobbery you bare witness here avid aversion growing " pop stars/pop idol/american idol/x factor " , style dross which floods todays market . thank goodness they so instead pandering it without question like mass vile celeb trash mags ! i use term " celeb " it loose sense here since one only show ones naked behind big brother labelled this dubiuos accalade these days ! best testament , myself many brits , late great john peel ( uber dj font all musical knowledge worth knowing ) loved magazine . it kind printed " old grey whistle test " i suppose , peel much loved bbc live music show 60 , 70 80 . if you love music then you love	1

received first issue 3 weeks after placing subscribtion order amazon , so faster than promised . kiplinger wealth information i look forward receiving it every month . i am exclusively holding mutual funds no individual stocks , some information magazine no interest me . reason i prefer money magazine . but reading both magazines monthly basis $1 per issue keeps me more disciplined focused saving money that worth every penny it .	1
my retirement plan sends me magazine , which so boring i don't even bother open it anymore ; kiplinger isn't all like . best part kiplinger it describes how real people average salaries , kids , debts invest future . there also some great articles parents how teach their kids manage their money . everything seems practical , but i've yet try any it . magazine broken into four sections : `ahead ' short articles finance news current event , `investing ' investing mostly stocks , `your money ' ways invest your money though not technical investing section more diverse , `spending ' which basically general interest new fun technologies other ways spend all money saved or made through investing	1

regular readers my reviews probably getting sick me mentioning kage baker , but i credit her getting me try lot things i wouldn't normally try if she hadn't part them . asimov science fiction magazine time where this case . while i bought fantasy science fiction magazine every month while now , i would also check asimov see if it baker story . if it , i would buy it . what i found , however , i enjoyed most other stories issues i bought well . thus , now i buying it every month too . much like fantasy science fiction , asimov contains mostly science fiction stories various lengths ( short story , novelette , novella ) couple columns some cartoons . difference two asimov contains no fantasy ( though some mike resnick stories fantasy feel them ) . however , magazine likes concentrate character-based science fiction , so you won't see lot " technology first , character second " stories magazine . personally , i think that good thing hard science fiction turns me off . if you're more into hard sciences , you may find stuff here interest you , but there good chance you won't . occasionally , there guest editorials ( they printed george r.r. martin guest honor speech worldcon october/november issue ) . there always " books " column , sometimes written paul di filippo , sometimes peter heck . authors use this column recommend books you may not come across . robert silverberg opens each issue " reflections " column cover everything space exploration ideas story-writing . james patrick kelly occasionally featured " net " column , examining various science fiction web sites other online activities . unlike fantasy science fiction , there often some poetry included well . finally , there calendar upcoming conventions covers world so you always find someplace go if you need get together group fans . bread butter magazine , though , stories . each story introduction editor ( currently gardner dozois , though change sheila williams january issue ) , which may explain genesis story , or just tell us how long it since author appeared asimov . one things asimov different it often serializes stories eventually appear book form . allen . steele coyote series serialized over last couple years all them collected two books ( coyote couple years ago , upcoming coyote rising ) . also , charles stross ' accelerando featured recent issues . one drawback this readers who only pick up occasional issue . instance , " survivor " october/november issue didn't really mean lot because i've missed everything came before it . it reward regular readers , though . asimov many writers who write almost exclusively magazine , or very least authors submit their stories this magazine first refusal . my favourite , kage baker , only seems appear here , only one story i know appearing realms fantasy . allen . steele . robert reed seems featured everywhere ( i swear guy churning them out like he machine ) but he featured lot asimov . magazine bound just like fantasy science fiction , however cover thin paper rather than thicker stock , so it tear bit easier . this advantage you sometimes leave it lying open reading ( though this only works if you're toward middle it ) . it also means it rolled up if necessary . only other fault i it , this strictly personal thing , stories don't always grab me much they fantasy science fiction . this mainly because i'm more into fantasy than science fiction , so this certainly wouldn't case everyone . while hit miss ratio varies issue issue , i say i never skipped story magazine . again , that benefit short fiction . you're not going waste lot time them . if i choose two magazines , i would definitely choose fantasy science fiction . however , asimov certainly good enough it easy make room both them . plus , picking them both up , i feel like i'm doing my part keeping short fiction alive . it only small part , but every little bit helps . david ro	1

i find interesting articles every issue i receive . i like fact articles offer wide range topics . example , you find articles relating diet , travel , relationships physiology . all issues provide yoga sequences you practice home . magazine offer advanced sequences more physically demanding simplier ones much less physically demanding . articles portray nicely sized color photos pose in-depth explanations how perform each pose . i am visual person who needs see more complex poses performed front me rather than described writing , so unfortunately , i can't take advantage some more difficult sequences . however , if practicing yoga some time familar enough wide range poses , or follow in-depth written instruction , you enjoy these sections . you may surprised volume advertisements found each issue . it doesn't bother me because there still remains plenty good reading each issue . you receive only 7 issues 12 month period . it would nice receive one every month . overall , entertaining informative magazine i recommend . yoga journal also fantasic website you explore free . website offers many interesting articles provides instruction information many common yoga poses .	1

american girl magazine geared girls aged 7-13 . much younger than many girls aren't reading appropriate level yet . much older they may ready move . but honestly i'm surprised read so many reviews 10 or 11 year old girls who feel they're too old this magazine . i don't believe girls age need magazines based solely makeup tricks , flirting boys , etc . ag articles such dealing relationships friends . like when you your best friend start grow apart . or when she moves away . articles like one girl whose family travels around world their sailboat two years . crafts you actually proud give age 10 . several reviewer complained magazine short expensive . it . but here why : there no advertising ( short anything american girl related ) . many magazines , advertising accounts easily half pages . advertising enables publishers sell magazines low cost . ag no advertising so charge fair price produce it . i'm more than willing pay kind publication . parents ordering your daughters , you know your girl . if you've got 10 year old going 16 , this may not your child . if you precocious 6 year old , she might like it well . ag kind magazine i'm glad my daughters enjoy	1

us weekly used cross people national enquirer - ever since new editor stepped ( it seems they new one every year ) magazine revamped . it looks more like classy people less like trash tabloid . i'm also little skeptical those who complain amazon.com doesn't deliver their magazines . not every business perfect , but i haven't problem my magazines delivered when i've ordered them amazon.com . it just makes me think all people whining just taking out their frustrations life amazon.com . maybe its why we see so many vicious jealous reviews , if you don't like your life change it . don't complain it , that how most people get where they today . anyway , unlike people , us weekly mainly focuses celebrities i think its price its far too short . least people thick . anyhow , celebrity junkie , us weekly must read . like reviewer , i too am tired reading jessica simpson brangelina . i think celebrity magazines tired this well . i'm starting see more diverse focus celebrities magazines . its certainly much better than reading touch life style weekly . although i like us weekly , i still think people best . people more classy , great layout , their focus 50/50 celebrities articles average folks . they great photos other interesting reads their magazine . even their website great , us weekly website looks like barbie website . recent changes great but if us weekly really wants compete people then it needs step up plate more . despite its faults , us weekly luscious read worth all its frothiness , so enjoy it .	1

this my favorite home/decorating/architecture magazine all time . perhaps it fortuitous coincidence , but " cottage living " always features homes areas country very interesting me - like adirondacks , boulder co , arlington va , asheville nc new orleans . editors good understanding cottage admirers their interests . therefore , they include floor plans , before after pictures , brief back-stories give us glimpse into life cottages their inhabitants . we get see cottages very different characters based their geographic region , their original purpose , style socioeconomic standing their owners . some homes really stretch definition cottage because their large size , but - usually - they convey spirit snug informal home anyway . we see cottage owners very ingenious using all interior space available . i love see how people used dormers , areas under staircase , other niches things activities would otherwise not practical because limited square footage . small space used wisely attractively challenge all cottage owners face . this magazine provides ideas galore . [ one thing puzzle annoy me magazine presence food articles . what living cottage - or wanting - anything type food anyone wants prepare ? i see no connection all . furthermore , recipes provided seem very labor ingredient intensive . i'd rather few more pages houses ! ] highly recommended !	1

one american evangelicalism sympathetic critics once asked whether there such thing christian mind . all sorts reasons - some more than justified - questioners , skeptics , malnourished pilgrims produced negative responses query . but perhaps things better than all . if encouragement ma taken books culture : christian review , there hope kind wide-ranging integration faith intellect so routinely dismissed implausible cynical , misinformed those who yet discover intellectual renaissance among evangelicals populated university departments ( philosophy physics spring mind parade examples ) proponents robust biblical faith . publication christianity today empire , books culture provides forum some most incisive writing cutting-edge thinking found among christians anywhere . one not talking puff pieces cotton-candy testimony . rather , kind thoughtful self-critical engagement great conversation myriad contemporary issues one expects fat intellectual monthlies reviews new york london times offer here , abundance . this reviewer - who fights his wife possession issue sometimes finds them tucked away bedroom squirrel-holes which she believes him ignorant - watched this young-ish paper emerge something renegade among evangelical organs find its voice stride within just few years . its trajectory not far astonishing . christian century once known thought this quality still hits occasional home run . if it cans sustain its current run , books culture , looks rather . 325 hitter which franchise glory made	1

all music orientated magazines i subscribe , outburn my personal favorite . this only magazine caters my favorite music ... techno , goth , industrial music . rolling stone stopped relevant 10 years ago . spin magazine joke . alternative press also joke stopped relevant many , many moons ago . i discovered outburn when i saw article one my personal favorite bands all time , vnv nation . rolling stone , spin , ap wouldn't touch vnv nation ten foot pole because it isn't popular brainwashed masses . last year . since then , i loyal reader well loyal subscriber quarterly magazine . what appeals me most outburn magazine covers more than just goth industrial music but also lesser known metal bands like lacuna coil opeth . i'm not metal fan long shot but it refreshing read magazine which heavy metal bands [ pooh ] mtv clear channel , er , radio plays non-stop ( i.e korn , deftones , limp bizkit ) . outburn covers lesser known metal bands mtv wouldn't dare play except maybe new incarnation " headbanger ball " . i also enjoy original questions writers throws artists bands they interview . they also don't sound patronizing or condescending one bit . unlike spin magazine which now become forum video games fashion opposed music , outburn sticks what it knows best which music . although marilyn manson cover new issue outburn , least i grateful editors didn't throw good charlotte cover . thing i love outburn free cd offer subscribers . nothing beats like free cd . my only problem outburn it quarterly magazine , not monthly magazine . i wish rags like ap , spin , rs quarterly magazines outburn monthly but all its worth , least outburn reliable terms quality articles doesn't insult my intelligence throwing justin timberlake christina aguilera cover like rs recently . outburn truly one few magazines i enjoy reading word word	1

if you one whose definition rock music fairly elastic whose taste rock music eclectic , then i recommend mojo magazine you . i haven't read all magazines relating music course , but those i , mojo best job covering music scene today . its approach fresh its appeal wide . unlike some other music mags around , it one whole family read probably find something musically meaningful each . its writers , whose taste music broad , approach music without allowing personal prejudices color their articles . they find much merit new nick cave cd they new bert bacharach effort , if music worthwhile they it without gushing . recent issue highlighted bob dylan , marianne faithfull , sid vicious sex pistols each which certainly appeal different audiences . thing i like best mojo each issue comes cd featuring various artists doing whatever type music focus month lead article . cd really adds value me anticipating next one . i never thought i'd like sex pistols , but when i heard feature cd songs influenced them , i understood their music lot better . you might get better deal magazine than offered here if you go bookstore , find magazine , look insert bearing special offer . that what i . whatever way you decide try magazine up you , but i'd surprised if you didn't find it informative , enjoyable , money well spent	1
if you fan certain genre music , it mainstream pop , punk or hip-hop , there least few magazines cater your taste . rarity magazine caters all-around pop music fanatic , mojo magazine tops obscure lis t.t his pricey publication , but well worth money . since discovering magazine several years ago , i amazed diversity cover features alone : beatles , abba , frank zappa , kate bush , white stripes , michael jackson , rolling stones , sex pistols , madonna ... there something everybody taste , plenty people wide range musical taste . cover features inside , i am always amazed space they give performers and/or bands small cult following . i especially enjoyed piece they incredible string band several years back . they usually when covering group history , mojo writers not shy away friction low points involved band career . no tabloid trash-talking or finger pointing , just good solid journalism ; showing strengths makes icon popularity endure , bumps road ended ride . reviews cds plenty , i often find myself discovering something new add my collection . you'll find reviews pop , punk , folk , blues , country , classic rock , you name it ! i also find reviewers lot more open minded when reviewing albums , which welcome holiday plethora snobbish music critics who go out their way trash good efforts . mojo , my humble opinion , top music mags . if you over all pop-culture fan like i am , always lookout something new add your collection , then mojo magazine should key resource your database !	1

computer gaming world around since early 80 it always best my opinion . lot people think their reviewing style bit harsh , but given price games how much garbage released , you really can't afford not read reviews before buying . computer gaming world gives concise , critical reviews explain exactly what good bad games market . highly recommended	1
growing up church , i've received lot christian magazines , depth analysis scripture , qa highschool drama help , but all fallen short what young christians today looking . i followed relevant magazine before they released their 1st magazine kept up amazing articles online . i very excited debut magazine made god relevant specific everyday life decisions made god seem ever more practical way we construct our lifestyles . god obviously great things this staff still working . their podcast also great really demonstrates character today young christian thinkers who excited their faith willing show it . they bring lot hope pray christians living culture denies christ . i'm not twentysomething quite yet , but message relevant important which : put away your indifference go out make mark culture glory god	1
relevant magazine reaches our culture , rather than form its own christian sub-culture . while magazine definetly aimed towards " 20-something " demographic it still speak all generations . it covers most important topics facing our world today , christian secular . it also covers books , movies good music . interviews include , cameron crow ( director " elizabethtown " " vanilla sky " ) , bono u2 , lovedrug copeland . writing somewhat shallow times , but overall isn't bad . magazine fit finish second none christian magazine market , thick glossy pages colrful , thick covers , although it could longer . this surely one best christian mags out there today . if your christian ready move christianity into next generation , i would highly recomend this magazine . if you like music i would recomend paste magazine , its owned christian covers some most excellent music around today	1
quite frankly this only cooking magazine i ever subscribed i actually looked forward using receiving every two months . i like it so much i am writing my first amazon review ! format magazine makes it easy follow recipes - they always printed two pages across each other - unlike some other posters i prefer black white format so paper thicker doesn't tear easily . tear away ads ( their own products ) outside magazine means usable portion doesn't take up much space my shelf . recipes easy follow usually clear . when they include specialized ingredients there usually also substitution listed . their product reviews terrific - i wish i hadn't wasted so many dinners bad whole wheat pasta . my only gripe , someone who not dishwasher , great number bowls kitchen tools recipes require . i made least half recipes magazines , many several times , which no small feat " flexitarian " who never meat main dish .	1
prevention more guilty pleasure me than anything else . it definitely not magazine you file away your beloved books ( i victoria , real simple , o ) , but you take little something each issue . it contain lot excellent information ranging herbs emotional health physical conditions , but articles really more than one or two pages long ( most ) it doesn't take long read cover cover . regardless , i enjoy it , usually learn something new interesting each issue . i'm not complete health nut , but i am interested long term issues try look out myself . most health magazines ( exception health ) too specific- each article really only applies certain group people , but most articles prevention apply entire readership whole . there very few us out there not struggling stress or interested ways preventing heart disease or cancer	1
macworld glossy monthly around long apple making macs . i've subscriber most time - if i saved past issues - could probably paper cupertino main streets this periodical pages . there number magazines devoted macs their unusually devoted users . macworld probably most mainstream dependable them . most periodicals dedicated high-tech fields , there more these pages than casual user digest . many articles appeal macgroupies subset macusers , those who find product fascinating itself rather than merely boon productivity dedicated other ends . however , even normal macuser like myself ( since 1987 ) enjoy coverage all things apple , including constant improvements which company become known relentless speculation what comes next . small tornado controversy brews pages over whether macworld should dedicate so much space ipod music issues , but apple seems fairly dictated its sprint direction magazine dedicated covering company products need follow direction it sets . there lots productivity hints - if followed - keep you increasing your own effectiveness machine . most useful feature me high-quality discussion improvements apple continues build into its own operating system(s ) . macworld go-to mac magazine , if that what you need	1

someone who reads lot magazines who left-liberal , i remain stalwart supported new republic . this despite fact , yes , they supported iraq war . their crucial failing enterprise they assumed bush would work democrats , etc ., actually get job . it easy anti-war left bash them after fact , but least you say they take moral ethical high road : they've advocating military intervention humanitarian grounds years , even if , case iraq , they made many mistakes , fact they represent american left willing intervene non-self-interested grounds important itself . many people suggested tnr steadily moved right under tenure martin peretz , but they remain committed some most important issues american liberals : universal health care , gay rights ( their most conservative editor , after all , andrew sullivan , openly gay republican ) progressive economics . jonathan chait probably best political-economics journalist working us today . yes , they decidedly centrist , yes , they feature large number conservative writers , finally yes , they unapologetically pro-israeli middle east issues which puts off american college left , but their analysis top notch , their reporting incredibly insightful , despite no longer " in-flight reading air force one , " they remain indispensable anyone wanting understand washington elite . arts front they're even more consistent : stanley kaufmann film criticism insightful top-notch ; i wish they more robert brustein theater , though least you give them credit national magazine which still drama desk . jed perl often insufferable his art criticism , but he very smart engaging . leon wieseltier , literary editor , one i like least , he given long , wincingly verbose pieces ( rarely books ) , but he one eminences grise american literary criticism . more engaging controversial james wood , whose occasional fiction reviews absolutely worth reading ; again , i rarely agree him , but he indispensable . just because you agree believer more doesn't make them more interesting read . basically , tnr great anyone who actually interested what going wants intellectually challenged ; end , i rarely outright agree their writers , but unlike nation or mother jones , they don't bother preaching choir , writing much better ( end , i only kept my nation subscription going arthur . danto occasional art pieces ) .	1

i'm usually not one taking chance new magazines ( especially if they've shoved down public throats or oprah winfrey endorses it ) but this one instance where oprah gets major-league credit putting her faith money rachael ray . i impressed magazine layout - not too elementary nor too complicated - recipes contained within delicious easy prepare ( you won't go searching every speciality shop country ingredients , either ) . i also like how rachael let readers her italian wedding african safari honeymoon . unlike other celebrities , she didn't let us know too much information ( thank you ! ) i'm sure her recommendations trattorias , cafes , hotels tuscany worth time easy budget . just because she doesn't initials besides her name culinary degree ( she not only one food network lacking this ! ) , rachael spent her whole life restaurants food she learned same tricks trade fusion chefs network know . this definitely worth look i'm seriously considering ordering subscription .	1

friend mine told me " fast company " year ago , i subscriber avid reader since then . magazine enigmatic , combining news magazine , cultural commentary , business reporting , entrepreneurial insights into one publication . many issues deserve five star rating , but occasionally cohesion editorial focus bit uneven . thing i most like " fast company " 21st century approach news analysis : it thought provoking , explores all sides complex issues , but never tries tell reader what think . perfect example this april , 2006 issue article " al jazeera ( global ) mission , " which former us marine now working english-language version al jazeera profiled extremely multi-faceted story . entrepreneurial bent magazine great younger managers small business professionals , reporting market trends second none . although there times i don't agree articles or editorials " fast company , " i always find them intellectually stimulating thought provoking . i recommend this magazine independent thinkers everywhere	1

yo he leido varias revistas o magazines como tambien les llaman tales como , seventeen , cosmopolitan , vogue , self , glamour , mademoiselle , teen , lucky , teen vogue , marie claire , por mencionar algunas , tanto las versiones en ingles como en espaol definitivamente me quedo con elle . es superior las demas , primera tiene excelente fotografia muy buenas impresiones , su moda es cosmopolita global , ademas de que presenta diseadores nuevos que aun todavia no son conocidos pero gracias esta revista sus carreras son impulsadas rapidamente la fama , sus propuestas reviews sobre cine , musica , libros teatro tambien son muy buenos , tiene cultura pop pero no es del tipo teenybopper como en otras revistas que se obsesionan con ciertas actrices o cantantes de ahi no salen . sus paginas de moda son preciosas aunque es cierto que muchas de las modelos que salen posando en estas paginas se ve que son anorexicas o le entran las drogas , tampoco me gusta el precio de muchas de estas ropas accesorios ya que por lo general van de 2000 1 millon de dolares , por favor pongan algo mas accesible economico . tambien tiene articulos de interes para todos , ya sea de salud , relaciones , sexo , belleza , politica , cultura o decoracion , estos son variados algunos son muy buenos , otros aburridos , otros son superficiales o estupidos , otros son solo trivialidades . pero en definitiva esta revista es muy buena , pero eso si es muy elitista , esta hecha para mujeres con estilo propio , que tienen educacion de colegio o universidad , que se visten para ellas mismas no para los demas , diferencia de cosmo , glamour , marie claire que claman ser feministas en lugar de eso son antifeministas o pseudo feministas , elle si les da un buen lugar sus lectoras , en lugar de llenarles el cerebro con puro sexo tarugadas de como contentar tu hombre , amigo o lo que sea , convertirte en una barbie para el como dicen estas revistas que acabo de mencionar	1

play definitely breath fresh air someone who truly engulfed second-hand suck . years magazines like egm , gamepro ( shudder ) , only multi-platform magazines i would read . i later became tired their increasing ridiculousness , both content reviews , so after suggested i check out this magazine many fellow gamers i decided , hesitantly , so . i mean how different could multi-platform magazine ? very . not only am i captivated wonderful choice cover art each month ( amazon should change display cover over shadow colossus one ) , but pages size publication more professional than any gaming mag currently out . ( i admit not read game informer , due their paper mario : thousand year door fiasco , i never intend . ) i could only think myself stupid not heeding words others sooner . my first copy issue 39 , march 2005 , sega choice cover main content month . wow , there content . nice spread sega upcoming lineup , interviews company people/developers captivated me more . reviews awesome , still awesome well , sometimes spilling over 2 pages more frequently than " competitors . " i knew right away this what i looking : magazine liked all kinds games wasn't afraid show it both previews reviews , magazine not insult my intelligence , nor choice games . i not seen one word " kiddie " or " baby game " attack because colorful sprites , or lighthearted content . quite contrary , magazine seems ardent its protection 2-d games , games just fun regardless how they look ; something very welcome this day age gaming . i also like how they some biting criticism , but still seem upbeat . take their 2005 e3 wrap-up issue where they criticized everything show itself , phantom games , specs next-gen hardware , but still positive things say them . not only , but magazine , once again , incredible coverage . how some interviews people such : hideo kojima ( metal gear ; boktai ) , tomonobu itagaki ( doa ; ninja gaiden ) , atsushi inaba ( viewtiful joe ; okami ) , koji igarashi ( castlevania ) , michael ancel ( rayman ; beyond good evil ; king kong ) , takao miyoki ( phantasy star universe ) , masato maegawa ( ceo treasure) ? simply incredible . not mention their brilliant cover story shadow colossus interviews developers . i cannot say enough how good this magazine . if i could use my years knowing gaming mags , sum up what magazine like , i would say it like cross now gone next generation , gamefan its anime section -- but very much mind its own . ( those worried anime section , it located back , so you won't miss out anything gaming related if you choose skip over it . ) i seriously implore you give it chance , even if you fan other magazines . go your local bookstore look through it , you don't purchase it , just see yourself . hopefully , you'll experience true difference play	1

(...) other magazines write similar topics outrageously priced their articles misleading you never learn anything actual relevance topics cover . one prime example this us weekly . i read several issues this past usually way someone giving mag me when they it i've actually only personally bought us weekly twice . but it style annoys me it magazine wants write interesting celebrity driven issues but often fails . please not confuse touch us weekly . what i sometimes think other people might easily dismiss touch like us especially since they sometimes feature same celebs right next each other newstands . touch keeps you " touch " celebrities their important/interesting stories happening week week their lives . but you don't feel like stalker or something reading this magazine i read other people comment us . touch always stays safe distance celebs personal lives not cross line their articles no matter who or what article written touch keeps up respectful tasteful point view subject/celebrity hand . they also talk important things public eye , such this weeks issue these few stories : people news section : cynthia nixon brand new life - this article talking how cynthia now found love happiness her life her lover woman . i no clue this till reading article . article just tells straight up facts , quote one cynthia friends saying " she totally love nothing hide . she two beautiful kids , money bank , incredible career , emmy career , now girlfriend . so cynthia , life couldn't better she wants share her happiness world ! " , nothing bad said article .. you tell , quite opposite . this way touch handles itself - it tells facts more happy things celebs lives less worse . but what i meant before it talks even no celeb issues this next story people news : * under survivors heading*montana plane crash miracle - man woman first presumed dead plane crash , but woman , jodee hogg managed free herself plane wreckage then free fellow parks co-work matthew ramige . they stayed anthor fellow passanger while he died then left get help walked two half miles - matthew broken back burns . it really amazing . kelly ripa advice working momsis joaquin still mourning his brother ? prince harry gets seriousmary kay defends her crimethere cover story . lo jennifer garner what . lo thinks " bennifer 2 " she still love ben . but even handled respectfully closest thing it gets sensationalizing it page entitled battle jens but it more fun than anything plainly obvious . here few more headings articles within mag - i think they pretty self explanatory so i'm just going list them : you friends your lover ex ? - three not crowd renee , jack his former wife , meg . fashion trauma - even celebs strike out , but these oops outfits saved ? why chip kim win $1 millionat home kelly osbourne - her pink paradisejerry favorite food stop - crossing jordan star jerry o'connel takes touch carney lathe 10 sexiest men season - it raining men this autumn , hollywood hunks strutting their stuff all over big small screens . what makes them best ? she plus-size model proud ! - america next top model toccara happy just way she . fatherhood changed my life ! - mark wahlberg talks his journey crotch grabbing bad boy devoted dadis tyra next oprah ? several more . i especially like section : it true ? - real story behind hottest gossip . you read this know what told truth . i noticed way more celebrities open up allow touch interviews tell them first hand facts than * other * magazines . also featured this issue article kevin costner wedding reception fair last weeks focused more his wedding this one more reception . it featured different pics/angles than last week so it not recycled material . katie wedding dream finally coming true ? - now her boyfriend divorce final , america favorite sweetheart free tie knot she couldn't happier !

paste magazine made just me ! i don't even know how it came ... i started receive now-defunct tracks magazine ( unsolicited - - probably last-ditch effort build subscriber base ) when they finally went under , i credited two issues paste . wow ! this magazine utterly awesome ! besides cd ( or dvd - - or sometimes both ! ) , music , films , cultural issues all enlightening well-written . it obviously labor love all those involved its creation . it literally chock-full interesting stuff , particularly not-necessarily-mainstream stuff . all honesty , i find advertisements particularly helpful turning me new great artists , which i probably would not heard otherwise . i also appreciate thicker-than-average cover , since i tend carry it around me while , devour it bits pieces every spare moment . each issue ends up plastered sticky-note reminders check out or follow-up something or other , i've even resorted folding over pages interesting articles later reference . magazine holds up very well my attentive abuse . so , if you ready escape pablum entertainment industry spoon-feeding you so very long , sure check out paste . support real artists , you won't disappointed	1
i've subscribing paste over year now , it great magazine . i agree what others said writing : interviewers often seem love their subjects deal musicians fans instead journalists . there tons reviews each issue wide variety bands music , sampler cd dvd worth subscription price all themselves . it great way listen bands you would never heard otherwise . if you love music spending small fortune cds , this magazine you . my only real criticism magazine it very text heavy , tons small print jammed onto each page , often background picture/design behind words , which makes it chore read . i would love see larger print less eye junk pages . then again , i'm closing 40 so younger eyes may not find it problematic	1

lot reviewers share similar views , seen recurrence similar criticism today magazines . what these complaints also common they tend fairly uninformed regard certain issues . first off , we all know t+l " affluent travelers . " read publisher description , it tell you just . so if you're not affluent traveler , then don't waste your money t+l stick budget travel . t+l occassionally " affordable " stories , especially their affordable issue march . but don't expect hotels under $200 night . you know why ? because nowadays under $200 night means you're step above youth hostal , especially europe where you pay extra 20% top every dollar today exchange rate . point t+l never positioned itself affordable travel mag , so criticize its shortcomings respect invalid complaint . anyone who claims photography blown out out focus hasn't picked up copy magazine since 1999 . furthermore , if all you saw straightforward photographs hotel rooms , you'd go out your mind boredom . there nothing wrong adding little art your photography , after all photography fact art , t+l pretty good job . so what if there beautiful woman photo . no one saying you look like her or promising she'll strewn across bed your hotel room . use your imagination - this travel photography travel + leisure magazine - it ain't newsweek . all other offensive problems media today , only america people complain too much skin . lastly , readers need understand magazines don't put more ads giggles . magazine business , ad revenue way magazine earns money . so more ads they , more profit they , more money they pay better photographers writers hire more staff more research , etc , etc , etc . no magazine going choose throw away money order not offend its readers fewer ad pages . fact , high ad content indication high circulation , which indication reader satisfaction . more people magazine reaches , more companies want advertise there . fact matter there no perfect travel magazine existence . they either too service heavy , or editorial fluff , or too scientific adventure-y , or just b-level publication . t+l its shortcomings , it its top whatever lists there lot high-end service there . but it stunning its share well written interesting articles	1

although i often disagree ' new yorker ' politically find writing seymour hersh offensive i believe ' new yorker ' publishes exceptionally fine pieces non- fiction . i stress non- fiction because this what interests me ' new yorker now ' . once it fiction salinger , singer , s.j. perelman . but recent years it writing malcolm gladwell , adam gopin number others . this without speaking special feeling class new yorker gives , its still topnotch cartoons , ' town ' feature , first-rate ' talk town ' calendar	1
this probably best magazine i subscribe . over past 5 years i've noticed quality my other subscribed videogame magazines deteriorated dramatically . but this one stays true . i thought now one would see drop quality , but quality writing just keeps getting stronger stronger . demo disc , example , continues stay chock demos most current even retro games . quality on-line reviews continues get better ! i love cd rom video tips , even enjoy just watching videos new upcoming games . other magazines , especially ones like gamepro , act like they give you demos , but this only magazine demo disc each ad every month . i even seen these demos sale auctions sites on-line ( including big one starts ) . i'm one those gamers rarely pays full price videogames , i appreciate able play demo some them , until i feel like paying them . amazon great site get used videogames cheap , i appreciate reviews helping me make decision buy game . hope this review helps somebody . mc white said : check it out !!	1
i thought my first issue your magazine little sparse . it very thin issue . models beautiful . this good . but you knowif you would include more depth articlessuch really depth stuff skin hair . like i said before aging skin needs more it some things like micro-dermabrasion could helpful . also 8 glasses water day most helpful thing woman could herself . beside plastic surgery , theres not much them . but i saythis , enlarge lips i put vitamin capsule my lips , then honey then good lip moisturizer leave it overnight . it doees make lips plumper . also i use baby powder my face face powder . sometimes i use this just my nose chin . sometimes i use half mayonaise conditioner mix them together make mayonaise smell better hair . sometimes i use vitamin oil my bath water such vitamin person buy this dollar store . im not rich but i some things help way i look my age . then you could include pictures mountains rivers stories people . then you could articles celebrities like frank converse , robert blake , really interesting ones like . paul newman always got something say interesting . also what ever happened actor richard hatch who starred hitchhikers ? someone told me other day most handsome actor there or yul brynner . i didnt see i should . i dont know if you agree or not but it would interesting see profile way he lived . i like brad pitt those people always great . i love jennifer anniston because she she higher up than most women her thoughts actions . angelina jolie i really like too beacause women like these women . i miss johnny carson they really need find someone replace him . yes there people like still world . ive found some them . well thank you	1
subscriber newsweek last 2 years , i'm happy endorse it . topics covered which interest me most involve national/world politics science ; however , i'm pleased discover other subjects covered i wouldn't typically seek out(entertainment , religion , etc . ) . i'm puzzled ranting other negative reviews . while it not perfect , i consider newsweek solid overall its coverage general interest	1
newsweek easy read interesting magazine . however , it not balanced economist or time magazine but come up some interesting articles developments worldwide . if you ignore conservative slant magazine , you enjoy coverage analysis various current world events . newsweek helps me keep up developments diverse range subjects including business society , international affairs , politics , arts other areas . i also appreciate its compact yet comprehensive nature . magazine helps put news into context . instance , i often frustrated during recent israeli-hezbollah conflict lebanon i could see news tv but not understand story behind news . however , after i read conflict newsweek , i got know background going back into decades i could now appreciate all news stories their proper context .	1
articles fun i've learned alot useful information , like last month article depression - fish oil exercise worked almost immediately . it not professional or academic journal - if you're general person street , you learn lot psychology	1
very much lives up it name focusing pastalso present . free offer disc makes this cool . magazine some really good interviews well	1
this one i subscribe , even though , strictly speaking , magazine better job covering contempo musica mondo . uncut those us who feel nostalgic popular music figures whose stuff held up over time . writing superior , vastly superiour anything print today . this because mag staffed geezers who cut their teeth writing likes nme probably something like top pops back day . writers veterans this good number reasons , among them they bring great perspective , journalistic professionalism , acute insights , otherwise forgotten trivia realization there more life than just listening tunes , i.e. there whole other culture happening simultaneously , their writing . actually , apart feature artist feature , this magazine more film , past present , i love this aspect it because editors choose actor , director , genre or actor/director focus oevre xhosen subject then just lay out whole wackawackapacka stuff you definitely going go out buy/ rent/ borrow view . i always find new movie i just got watch after reading my latest edition uncut . plus , each issue comes complimentary cd . selections these cd spotty i find poor ones i spin through just couple times , good ones , i keep play lots . you won't sorry you subscribed this mag but you likely sorry you didn't if you ever get chance see what you missed not doing so	1
this great magazine those who curious . every month packed wide range interesting articles diverse scientific subjects . lot fun , very stimulating	1
okay , i've read other reviews call this publication shallow , lacking depth , geared toward young teenagers , etc . i guess if you looking twenty page , in-depth technical articles delve into every minute neutron particular subject , then yes , this publication might not what you're looking . but , if you're regular , average , ordinary guy like me ( who would not understand those deep , brainy articles anyway ) you looking entertaining , informative view onto what new what cool , i think you'll pleased . very pleased ! take , example , couple recent issues ( see date when this review written ) . last month focused future personal aviation people behind effort make personal flight more available affordable , aircrafts they inventing . fascinating ! now , i run out build myself prototype after reading articles ? ummm , no . i know whole lot more incredibly fun subject then i before ? yes ! this month issue focuses similar theme : future personal space travel idea space-hotel . when you're reading it you able build rocket fly moon ? course not . but it informative educational exact level i would want it ... just enough make me aware , enlightened , entertained . so all non-nerds , non-rocket scientists , non-brainiacs who want scientific publication people , people , i think your yearly subscription money well spent . enjoy	1

i picked up copy british vogue when i finished reading my american vogue month , interested british vogue its take fashion , plus i've subscriptions british magazines past impressed them . there many , many things set this magazine apart american vogue . first , this magazine main focus fashion . they devote more space models than celebrities , socialites , or noblility types . they don't only focus high unreachable fashions but also feature more affordable clothing ( granted , its mostly british stores , but thought counts ) . articles british vogue more educated , they cover more ground . thing i really liked this magazine not only shows fashions trends but also shows you how put them together , what mixes what , what you should looking getting . they also talk staple pieces this magazine , how where buy those . this magazine also pride country you don't see u.s. anymore which breath fresh air . snootiness american vogue , parading around couture only , $900 first night sets whatnot left out this magazine . it almost seems like this magazine more practical than its american counterpart . lastly , this magazine higher quality , full , glossy pages , glossy cover , overall 2 inches bigger all way around than its american counterpart . this magazine very , very good , i just wish subscription more affordable .	1
i reading history today years . it covers largely european , especially british , history , occasional articles american world history . articles written established scholars sound popular historians , such antonia fraser alison weir , accompanied brief bibliographies . illustrations usually drawn sources contemporary subject article . its only drawback americans price . however , after years freeloading libraries , i decided get subscription . believe me , it worth it .	1
new york review books , new yorker must weekly read me . i read it , cover cover except ads , 45 minutes hour each night before sleep . roger angell baseball best ; lane denby tag teamming movie reviews ; joan acocella dance ( dance ! i've read more it than i've ever seen ) , list goes . left wing ? several reviewers here said magazine left wing . this hilarious . obviously these people never read left wing maqgazine , such comments only illustrate extent which political spectrum us shifted rightward . left wing try : nation , progressive , dissent , or monthly review . new yorker middle brow bourgeois it gets	1
i subscribing new yorker five years now , it very enlightening experience . new yorker its part covering big news stories , but it not really news magazine . perspectives unique ( admittedly lean left ) , kind you're not likely get elsewhere . authors use first person because they tend part stories they're covering . take jon lee anderson , probably most credible reporter covering middle east today . his " letters " various cities involve accounts his meetings locals leaders . other segments more like npr stories -- unique perspectives largely uncovered topics aren't time-sensitive . you'll get in-depth looks into developments medicine , law , architecture , etc ., otherwise wouldn't get your radar unless you profession . , writers incorporate " larger questions " stories focused recent events . like malcolm gladwell recent account playwright who plagiarized material former article written him . he parlayed his personal struggle into good summary legal ethical positions use or development one person idea . i grown look forward reading fiction selection each week . sometimes i don't like piece , but i enjoy getting chance read writers i normally wouldn't those i normally would . additionally , magazine added more dedicated issues -- most recently " food " issue , addition standbys like " style " " fiction " issues . i loved " food " issue , especially one writer account search truly authentic pasta involved work night mario batali kitchen trip italy . i enjoy balance hard news , balanced interest stories , arts new yorker provides . i began my subscription get different perspective than what i got local southern news , i keep it same reasons many more	1

my husband i both love cook , some our new favorites come this magazine . reviews informative , recipes taste great ( not overly complicated ) , basic cooking suggestions helpful . magazine likes pick theme month ( or several ) which couple benefits . 1 . you cook meal right one issue it all tastes great together 2 . you several options one basic idea . example one month there whole article rice pilaff which starting basics ( so you could modify basic recipe your own way ) then gave several variations . best i found out there so far	1

i subscribed multiple photography magazines first when i started getting serious photography . i subscribed ' photography ' ' american photo ' this one , popular photography imaging . three this magazine most balanced amount reviews , ' how tos ' , digital imaging related topics ( photoshop , etc ) well some nice contests . also they seem sponsor more ' mentor series ' type products where you go some locale shoot photos reasonable fee . all magazines this also something important me - half magazine isn't ads . photography worst offender this , there'd 50 or so pages weak articles , then 50 pages solid ads . while this one chunk ads near back , it still ' back page ' article articles mixed among ads . only 25% magazine advertisements . they also support nice online website ( popphoto.com ) forum where people logon ask questions . while not heavily trafficked say dpreview.com authors editors read respond questions . overall great magazine hobby	1

i've subscribed bar least 6 years now , i enjoy mix articles holy land archeology related topics . current events reported informative useful . book reviews helpful guiding further reading field . i recommend it highly . my only complaint content would editor tends focus controversies press field perhaps merit less attention than he gives it . course , it seems self-serving his part keep beating drums , but it never dull . probably sells few extra copies evry month well . little background myself : ba degree anthropology , ordained elder presbyterian church , usa . i worked public school 20 years now .	1
what positives one say ' national geographic ' magazine hasn't said already . ' ng ' american institution appeals individuals thirst multi-culturalism , science , sociology . photography stunning say least . it often said ' best education ' travel far wide see how other cultures live think . since this isn't practical many , next best thing read ' national geographic ' magazine ! addition , fairly recent cover article ' evolution ' well written , convincing , accurate ! myopic , ignorant reviewer below who thinks world revolves around her , who mentioned not into soccer , i say this her : most world loves soccer ( technically called football ) , all nfl , mlb , nba fans combined don't even come close combined numbers soccer fans worldwide ! i am subscriber life	1

i rarely write reviews but couldn't believe what i read other reviewers , most whom focused how ritzy lifestyles parents depicted articles , how " expensive " clothes , how pretty moms ( models ) , etc ... this magazine . don't we expect some kind facade ? other " parenting " magazines may appear more " real " parents , but this no more than their chosen tactic . any publication whose foundational goal sell more advertising , they wouldn't doing this unless they believed it going work . they selling certain " lifestyle " just like child magazine . if it more accordance yours , fine . but why trash just because it different ? child magazine isn't perfect . but least it doesn't pander . anyone really want see what target latest attempt toddler fashion when they open magazine ? i'd rather just check myself next time i'm out buying diapers . if you value solid writing above all else magazine , then child magazine you . ( whether you afford $90 pair toddler shorts page 28 won't such issue . )	1
when i considered subscribing ft last year , i slightly disappointed there wasn't any recent reviews it . so here we go ... i subscribe both wall st journal financial times ( ft ) , past subscribed economist . comparison sake , wsj very good its section one coverage , especially front page stories , political coverage , its excellent frequently quoted editorials . me , other stuff fluff . regarding economist , it highly touted weekly newsmagazine two downfalls ( reasons why i cancelled my subscription ) - it weekly (!) seems interject alot commentary into its stories . which leads us ft . ft , i feel like i'm reading news , more importantly , it daily format , ensuring you'll up date latest global news . there excellent coverage us happenings , europe asia . once you read it , you feel much better informed - where else you get daily extended coverage russian/ukraine natural gas issue or , several months ago , daily coverage germany elections ? excellent reporting comes great , although somewhat left/liberal commentary - don't let dissuade you , however . other gems include business reporting , including stories management ideas , business life , etc .... most excellent weekend edition ( saturday ) , full all sorts cultural stories , including food , wine , arts , book reviews , travel , like . not too mention awesome columns lucy kellaway , martin lukes , tyler brule . you must pick this up indulge yourself few weeks , if you undecided . you not disappointed . reading owning ft must .	1
i enjoyed this magazine kid , but then , i also loved electric company . looking both now , they seem dated tedious , but perhaps our children need something moves slower pace than everything seems now . neither my children ( 5 7 ) enjoyed highlights first , but after getting subscription their grandmother , they discovered joy curling up quiet corner figuring out puzzles stories themselves . it magazine style format encourages reflection absorption , rather than voracious grab go version reading , i believe give child better foundation .

i always avoided parenting magazines : their crowded covers life-or-death information , flash-in-the-pan expert pontificating ( pacifiers dangerous ! not using pacifiers dangerous ! ) , buzz-word-loaded headlines , frantic exclamation points , they unappealing me local evening news . inside those magazines just scattered hectic their covers , nanny , articles themselves , primarily life parent like getting your spouse help out , sex after kids , how get your groove back/feel hip , what toys buy your children next , etc , not really my niche anyway . i subscription martha stewart kids little while , because i liked project ideas ( though i always adapted them make them much less involved ) , but focus magazine become large , elaborate , professionally catered birthday parties , so i dropped i t.t hen , i came across wondertime . while other parenting magazines remind me parents swapping opinions , advice , gripes other parents , this more like what child would tell you if he could : example , what makes playroom truly functional child -an article which begins mother realizing her formal dining room waste space which i wish i could give every family i've ever worked . article " come play me " summer 2006 issue begins " grown-up mean you've outgrown child play ? c'mon , you know you it you . here some playful ideas outing your inner child . " it actually perspective how enjoy it -not tips how cope fact you find it mind-numbingly boring or must endure it necessary " quality time . " article " broom one own " talks how much children love included , helping , doing something themselves . toys mentioned here things like mirrors , sand , water , great outdoors ( sense advertisements here seem really out place ) . i also deeply appreciate magazine attitude towards children learning . other magazines , there abundance advice how ensure you stimulating your children much possible , how manipulate their play exploration , how make everything into language game , everything into quiz , everything into kind lesson which adult charge show puts child through his paces . this magazine , least now , takes approach learning happens . allow it happen allow yourself enjoy around it . i love . i can't wait see third issue	1

national wildlife followed trend taken most other nature magazines past decade - trend pessimism . mother nature knows there serious problems wildlife associated human society , but i need occasional pleasant break keep me out depressed state seemingly held these magazine editors . recently ten years ago , national wildlife others ran detailed articles fasnicating lives our wild neighbors . since then , magazines gone nature documentary format one " bad news monthly . " our increasingly urbanized human population , this may only way sustain interest wildlife their plights , but i fear it turning some us away . while i don't think national wildlife should shy away political lifestyle issues , i think they should lighten up bit . photographs still beautiful , animals still fascinating . i hope nwf doesn't lose sight why we became interested wildlife first place .	1

home business magazine publication aimed those members general populace who either already own home based business or who active interest subject would like pursue it further . this magazine contains articles relating all facets home business ownership initial setup all way through payment taxes year end . i read several different business magazines many them entrepreneurship . home business only one i read specifically devoted starting business home , unfortunately , it many flaws prevent it enjoyable informative read it otherwise could . probably most annoying feature this magazine articles themselves their tendency written list- type format rather than user- friendly way . i realize people like lists but home business takes this little too far . it makes magazine seem callous unfriendly- something you would consult same way you would almanac . example , it common find one page article title like " effective ways design newspaper ad " , or " how obtain quick financing " . each instance , these articles short opening consisting paragraph or two followed numbered listing different methods/suggestions solve problem or answer question . this makes magazine read more like reference guide than piece reading material . thing annoying this magazine endless advertising . not only it get out hand , it also includes all sorts ads emphasize money- making schemes other similar material . advertisements titles like " really lazy guy incredible little secret idea make you rich " , " free $9.95 report shows you how make fortune " , " six figures six months " clutter pages this magazine get- rich quick garbage everyone knows unlikely return even cost introductory package . some parts this magazine more bearable than others it this handful positive attributes prevent me giving this magazine one- star rating . i like some success stories because they depict ordinary people who succeeded making living home- based business . but even here , stories inconsistent . some educational nature while others little valuable information share . make matters worse , they far too short- usually covering only one- half page each large advertisement taking up space bottom each page . speaking advertising , this magazine wrote book advertisement excess . advertisements cover 75 percent pages each issue it rare see even two pages row without some sort advertisement . ads posted everywhere , often right middle article , they distract greatly already limited enjoyment magazine . this magazine assembled together such way it reads like collection articles taken people different parts country shuffled around published one magazine . other words , this magazine no continuity it . it like taking short articles different business newspapers around usa then piecing them together into one magazine . starting home- based business goal many people set themselves there always need some good , timely information when you find yourself this situation . home business , unfortunately , doesn't perform its mission very well . if you dig deeply enough you find few good articles . but majority too impersonal too shallow ( not mention smothered advertisements ) make this magazine worth trouble .	-1

" spin " accurate name something like this -- lot hype , innocuous but rather tepid rock magazine . if rolling stone dirty old geezer rock magazines , then spin teenager who tries hard convince you he cool name-dropping strokes . spin covers some same turf rolling stone blender , but less lasciviously -- lots coverage popular bands . some them quite good -- hives , example , or indie newcomer steve burns ( who quit his job " blues clues " after hearing flaming lips album , reinvented his life rocker ) . unfortunately they overemphasize whatever bands hot moment , then overemphasize them again -- well tacking them up whatever " coolest " / " best " lists they chalk up year/decade/century/history rock . indie cred maintained few half-page articles potentially hot bands like comas metric , but this info halfhearted . it like they're reluctant tear themselves away articles better-known bands , regardless talent . writing , however , certain affliction lot major rock magazines : need cool . their writers always trying funny , but rarely come across way . it seems silly strained , like soccer mom wearing spandex tube dress . even cd reviews mediocre . however , one recent highlight dave eggers ' columns -- witty , funny , little bit skewed . fact , they often best things entirety magazine . one problems emphasis stuff hollywood . scarlett johanssen wonderful actress , yes . but she doesn't sing , nor she appeared music-based movie -- jack black yes , scarlett no . what up party coverage tv starlet mischa barton mtv couples ? check out sublimely indie mags like chord , filter , under radar online kludge in-depth looks some worthy bands . spin ? it still trying convince us it cool , but eggers only regularly cool thing it	-1

anyone good taste music hate this magazine , it only rates bad bands bad genres good reviews whatever good bands listed , often given bad reviews . its all pretentious pop-culture drivel conformist , weak-willed mainstream american . worst part rolling stone 100 greatest guitarists all time list ; they highly rate kirk hammett , kurt cobain , tom morello ( all extremely overrated guitarists ) while rating eddie van halen very lowly #70 not even mentioning these awesome guitarists ; kerry king/jeff hanneman ( slayer ) , john petrucci ( dream theater ) , trey azagthoth/erik rutan ( morbid angel ) , jeff loomis ( nevermore ) , steve vai , joe satriani . if you know anything good guitarists , those eight guitarists i just mentioned destroy kirk , kurt , tom . don't read this if you're trying decide what good music , you decide what good music . think yourself , don't let mtv rolling stone think you	-1

interview definitely different type magazine me- someone who usually reads business travel mags- it not quite what i expected . title like " interview " i read my first copy this magazine anticipating pages pages nothing but interviews . it turns out interviewing main focus magazine , but it not only one . there substantial space given fashion , movies , other areas , too . some these columns worth occasional look , but they failed grab my attention . writers seem play it safe , includes interview section . they don't ask many daring or controversial questions . they keep it simple , asking questions entertainer latest album or movie , without delving much into their personal lives . interview many general annoyances . my greatest complaint advertising arrangement contents . half pages each issue covered ads , fashion , liquor , beer , hair care items providing bulk advertising revenue . ads everywhere , majority front pages each issue . table contents buried , i find this very frustrating . contents starts interviews specific issue one page , then few pages later , proceeds remainder contents , which regular monthly features . what annoying you search table contents . it varies one issue next , falling somewhere first half . interview also varies greatly length . some issues short 80 pages while others more than 200 pages long . shorter issues use staples binding while longer issues bound more professional way , minus any metal . this magazine centers entertainers , fashion , music , like . you won't find any interviews politicians , businessmen , etc . interview sticks strictly entertainers , includes regular monthly columns . you won't find column business side music industry or film industry . you find only articles stars themselves . interview only saving grace photography . it would make nice gift those who enjoy fashion who like looking pages pages men women modeling fancy clothing . but many ways , photos overemphasized there isn't enough substance magazine . articles very shallow more eye candy than reading material . overall , interview sloppy cluttered too many ads make it worthwhile reading material . my subscription free , i'm thankful it . besides few nice photos clothing , there isn't much make this magazine worth cost .	-1

flipping through pages writer digest local bookstore , i found some its content particularly useful interesting , especially those trade writing could benefit novice writer . so i decided subscribe magazine it only then i realise problems persist this seemmingly wholesome helpful magazine . since i subscribed online directly through wd website jan 2005 , i received only few issues . first few months almost half year , i received no issues all . it only later then when i e-mailed them they manage get some issues through me . annoying thing even though i e-mailed wd few times this problem , they would reply apologetically saying they extend my subsription . how this tackle root problem ? if they could not assured its overseas subscribers consistent service , they should not offered ' overseas subscribers ' option . ironically , i received their letter asking renewal my subscription recently my home address clearly printed front letter . logistic problems aside , magazine its plus points . issues , there useful tips writers not simply craft writing , but also business spiritual aspect writing process well . occasional issues also features insights into lives authors give us idea how where they work , their opinions life areas which they derive their inspiration . all this range authors range genres . essentially , business writing also not left out . however , magazine not one fraught without problems . problem wd information presented readers too limited scattered . each article though containing valuable tips writing , not enough depth really improve work authors if they really implemented . addition , because its range , it also not provide what some writers really want consistently , which waste time them read if they subscribers . sometimes , it seem magazine purposely limiting information they give readers order encourage further buying future issues . this example , seen amount publishers ' addresses they offer . most , each specific article particular topic contains average 7-10 addresses . there nothing wrong this , but why would author want waste his time bits pieces such information when he just purchase writer market collection publishers(and agencies ) addresses collected into one ? ironically again , same company publish ' writer market ' collection which excellent quality annually . said , same problem - lack information depth , also seen advice tips it gives well . make matters worse , every issue usually cluttered plethora advertisements frustrating readers times . writers want organise their time information , not add it . if you want thinking subscribing wd , consider alternatives currently available . writing craft requires more common sense acumen than many would like think . however , if you not particularly concerned little information fed you slower dozes or not too worried little more untidiness your life , than this magazine might you . but your research first	-1

after falling love gourmet yellow cookbook , i subscribed gourmet , hoping same great classic recipes commonsense commentary . wow , what disappointment . i just received my second issue , reviewer said , it 90% ads high-end luxury goods like jewelry cars . 6-page " special advertisement section " stops so special when there 20 them one issue ! what happened , ruth reichl ? few recipes one find unattractive and/or too difficult even weekend cooking . those cooks looking great cooking magazine , i highly recommend bon appetit over gourmet : majority magazine recipes cooking tips , only interspersed ads . i calling see if i get my subscription switched tomorrow .	-1
first issue arrived today . after tearing up 8 or 9 insert ads which made it difficult read magazine , i sat back enjoy . first article lecture robert . kennedy jr. danger mercury fresh water domestic fish . perfectly safe fish we informed ( well duh ) . just don't eat what you catch . expectant mothers should extra careful babies high level mercury lower iqs . net full peer-reviewed studies major universities subject mercury poisoning . why buy food magazine read what activist lawyer say subject ? next article : " politics plate " . controversy here concerns local season foods . gourmet asks : " those who promote them sincere ? or it just come gullible diners ? " so who gourmet think " gullible " ? reader ? implication seems reader too stupid figure out yes , vendors might promote locally grown products aren't all terrific . nothing substance this article all . going back front , editor gourmet recalls how her late father didn't appreciate health food stores ( aren't fathers stupid ? ) . three downer articles row . i gave up . this isn't magazine i remember 20 years ago . even format annoying . it difficult know where ads end articles begin ( recall most junked up website you've seen , gourmet model ) if you enjoy politics environmental stuff ( either side ) you better net free . if you want entertaining , informative articles food , gourmet not place look . subscribed saveur same time gourmet . it pleasure read . no annoying ads , no political screeds . great photographs . interesting exotic recipes . good or better than gourmet decades ago .	-1
i found this magazine helpful introduction advanced computing . that it . this mag seems biased towards certain products amp ; manufacturers . they neglected open my eyes wider . reviews/articles published seem favor big money companies ( microsoft , dell , etc ) . they don't give credit smaller , better , less-well-known companies technologies . all info pretty basic intro users , but if that what you interested ... then this great non-comlicated publication	-1
editor gratingly smug breezy monthly letter sets pace this vapid lifestyle magazine , which you'll enjoy only if you're like her -- rich , creepily entitled , self-absorbed , interested merely accoutrements opulent dining , but not really food or actual cooking itself .	-1
i subscribed cooks magazine some years ago , back when it began publishing again . i problems issues failed arrive , wrote them it - never received reply or any note concern . since time , i occasionally glance through it newsstands see if there any articles interest . even dint casual glance , i've begun tire formulaic articles which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients order finally come up " perfect recipe " something or other . i now skip right " perfected " recipe , decide whether its worth committing memory . some explanations success or lack thereof inclusion or exclusion particular ingredient hare-brained bes t.t here also two other areas this magazine disappointed me : 1 . product reviews : they range just plain wrong idiotic . kitchenaid pro 600 hailed cook best its class many mixing chores . yet , amazon reviews tell different tale - one short lifespan when used mix bread dough because plastic gear cover deforms finally comes apart , allowing metal gears separate . christopher kimball ( editor ) once performed evaluation cookware which he calculated price cookware per pound its weight . no , i'm not joking . evaluation , le creuset came out top simply because it heavy . all-clad , even though it conducts heat very evenly , suffered not much heft , therefore judged pricey , pound weight basis . one issue cooks boasted its cover " unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others " . apparently , hershey designated best . not too many months later , callebaut recommended above all others , hershey judged barely acceptable . feeling manipulated yet ? 2 . finally , there those dreadful editorials mr. kimball . rambling , painfully written , punctuated picture mr. kimball wearing bow tie , looking very much if his head held it . mr. kimball humble man , much humble . he writes if he chanelling helen gurley brown , but red black flannel watch-plaid without her sense play . time re-vamp this magazine , folks	-1

i looking forward magazine took good look different subjects than those covered mainstream media . what i received manual how think " right " way . i've never delved deeply into politically labeling myself , but i vaguely considered myself liberal . man , i wrong . clearly , liberal means much same demonized " conservative " . this magazine single viewpoint , ultraliberal ex-hippie who found themselves wealthy 21st century . it full articles " finding meaning " " reassessing life " seem written folks who drive chevy suburbans pay too much cup coffee . magazine gives off strong smell covert superiority , it made me nauseous	-1
i've read many positive reviews this magazine i receive , several months ago , trial issue . after sending subscription fee , i billed again . i wrote note letting them know check endorsed deposited . yesterday , i got notice telling me my subscription expired after one issue . i give up . it might good , but customer service really lousy . what disappointment .	-1

i picked up issue this magazine last week because i wanted take picture cover girl into my hair dresser . after i got it home , i opened it up check it out discovered it most brainless magazine i ever seen . articles read like something " teen beat " , yet it filled adult material . there 10 articles " how please your man " " what guys like " even " sex workout " . these articles didn't contain any " real " advice -- just unintelligent babble . instance , any you know guys don't like it when you act unenthusiastic during sex ? hmmm , crazy . anyway , i don't see how anyone over age 16 could find any this stimulating , yet there too many articles one-night stands anyone under 18 read . but if you're still into taking quizzes looking " half-naked hunks " who barely hit puberty , then this magazine perfect . i would given this magazine 0 stars , but unfortunately it not option	-1

i one entertainment weekly charter subscribers way back 1990 . it started out great -- different , intelligent witty approach entertainment coverage . but financially , things shaky , so magazine dumbed down bit reach wider audience . i couldn't blame editors . it helped them reach needed tipping point , they gained their needed mass audience . ew remained better than any other publication entertainment focus , i kept resubscribing . until 2006 . these last few months , ew fallen off cliff . it become entirely superficial shallow , hardly any substance all . publication design also degraded into teen magazine format . i only imagine editors decided anyone over 30 no longer part their target audience . so , i've let my subscription lapse -- reluctantly , mourning enjoyable magazine used	-1
i reader businessweek over 10 years . i noticed it significant change focus over last year . while there more articles " personal business " , hard-core articles gone way newsweek , u.s. news world reports . nature articles lightweight not reflect issues important decision makers today . like many others , i noticed political slant or agenda over last year . specifically , their commentaries economic analysis trend left . bob kuttner co-editor american prospect contributor boston globe . every one his articles begins premise president policies bad then followed tortuous rational thesis , include discussion days gold backed currency . andrea d'andrea tyson better , but former clinton advisor , not objective her analysis . alternative economic opinions far few what opinions they tout , not agree numbers stated their own figures week . while bw potential great reporting based their resources , they let their editorial priorities get way serious business reporting . serious business readers students , i recommend going alternative sources . yes , i let my subscription lapse this year .	-1
i subscriber new republic several years , but waning years clinton administration beginnings bush ii administration , paper seemed take real rightward turn . now , i no problem so-called liberal hawks , but magazine slavish support war iraq face questionable evidence it me . addition , magazine spends more time bashing democrats not aligning themselves magazine professed centrist/liberal slant than it presenting true progressives ideals create thoughtful discourse among its readers . magazine forgotten its roots progressive intellectualism dissent favor safe , " new democrat " rhetoric . there better magazines our there	-1

this magazine given us gift subscription when our son born , but both my wife i quickly tired it . previous review pointed out their lack scientific research good bulk their advice their tendency misquote distort studies just plain irresponsible . magazine seems firmly stuck fantasy ' pc ' world lofty goals ideals your children very little real world application . articles disciplining your children read lines ' if your 2 year old hits his brothe rin face soccer ball , look him straight face , make eye contact tell him it not nice hit ' . thanks pearl wisdom . anyone 2 year old atest futility reasoning them . never would parents magazine advocate something might actually work like say taking all his toys away marching his butt corner where he gets stand say 9 years or until he adopted neighbors :) seriously , magazine writes fantasy land scenario where june ward parents kids act like munchkins disney tv movie . if you happen cleavers , go it ..	-1
this magazine almost bad consumer reports . their comparison tests never adhere their thesis what tests measureing , example comparison test said quick acceleration point handling then car lack lust performance handling acceleration would #1 ranking . often , car reviews always mentioning information car isn't relevant , or doesn't make sense , or review isn't consistent posted viehicle stats . magazine also seems biased . some vehicles criticized more irrelevant information than others say its awful . after further reading many issues , you would think they playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs manufacturers , example , you always see domestic brand referred basically " trash " japanese brand or bmw always way go , when once again posted stats sometimes photos say differen t.t his more noticeable when you predict out come their reviews . ultimately , its bad guide towards getting any information automobiles period . its pat robertson auto magazines . if it possible , i woudln't even give this magazine 1 star .	-1
i subscriber time over 15 years before reader my parents ' subscription . it pains me say this magazine forgotten what it . frankly , only issues worth their salt those resulting major world event such natural disaster or terror attack ; such events seem energize otherwise listless staff seemingly bored editors newswriters . newsweekly obligation go beyond newspapers -- use extra couple days provide more balanced analytical view . unfortunately time fixes its editorial position beginning story -- any future coverage designed prove time initial position correct . immediate taking editorial position then carried into all future coverage event ; stifling analysis preventing any analytical development beyond first few stories --" we told you so , we told you so . " even worse , coverage lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens which point sensational event becomes ultimate interpretation entire story . can't magazine occasionally admit it wrong rather than turning its eye away story continues burn ? out sight , out mind mantra ... fact , i sometimes debate whether decline this magazine mirrors or outpaces general decline our media ; newspapers failing , television news can't seem get away gory or sensationalistic , even academic journals specialized themselves into irrelevance . we seem greater appreciation comedy than analysis . neutrality dead . frankly , i don't care so much any perceived editorial slant i fact magazine increasingly boring irrelevant . time used excellent coverage trends events outside united states -- no more . iran building nuclear weapons but merits occasional blurb world summary page . african states making vast strides towards democracy , we get article nigerian computer fraud . russia emerging turmoil perestroika its painful transition much teach costs value democracy , but we seem focus only latest roadbomb iraq . japan , one world most influential cultures , week i originally wrote this review ( see 12-month subscription ) merited only snippet regarding royal marriage analysis foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling . somewhere wide world fascinating place or culture which time could send correspondent bring place people alive its readership , instead we get tabloid excrement nature joel stein puerile take pornography social deviants . but most damning fact after reading time one asks : how hell our world become boring ? time try emulating economist rather than enquirer ? someone needs step restore proud tradition complete in-depth coverage -- educate reader world which we live ; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine spotlight any various cultures countries which real interesting events take place every single week . time history potential five-star magazine , if only it would just focus finding reporting news	-1
time long increasingly superficial its news coverage , recent years only accelerated this trend . 60s 70s , it somewhat serious magazine centrist bend ( originally it considered quite conservative ) , but years go it degenerated into more more pop-culture fluff little substance . its part " liberal " media , this inaccurate . recent coverage ( 2004 ) election attempted reduce democratic candidate status non-person . first debate john kerry george . bush not even covered , except one very brief article listing few " fact check " points . instead , cover story wa new products movies , kind sharper image catalog lite . time also gave no coverage whatsoever election afghanistan . it mentioned passing article u.s. election , but i would imagine conservatives would object magazine ignoring signficant world event george . bush pointed one his accomplishments office . my view neither candidate received adequate fair treatment . bias seems favor mr. bush , but it still mostly bland superficial . your money better spent british magazine " economist " which far more substantive . while its editorial viewpoint conservative , it sound fiscal conservatism rather than tent-revivalism currently substitutes conservatism u.s. politics . " economist " also provides liberal viewpoint closest i've found ( dare i say it ) fair-and-balanced approach news . time still entertaining read , but i wouldn't take what they say too seriously . they tend bend political wind	-1

people magazine one worst expressions american life . instead makiing our own lives more meaningful exciting - which possible - people encourages us oogle fixate over people who essentially images , people we never meet , many cases people who very little going them . anyone really think britney spears anything say anything , or paris hilton barely aware her own existence ? it ever make whit difference your life how many times . lo engaged ( order get cover magazine ) or who demi moore grinding today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	-1
i've subscriber this over 10 years i've loved getting this , but it undergone changes recently not better . specifically , i hate what they've graphical design inside . whereas they used employ several different styles when it came things like fonts artwork whatever subject written , now they've adopted uniform style where nearly everything looks same . it looked better before . writing isn't witty or sharp ( longtime staff departed ? ) , there " filler " pieces form moronic sidebars boxes - useless attempts humor simply don't work . strength magazine continues come critics , especially movie dvd section . sadly , typically , when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like i'm going consider letting my sub expire ' cos i don't let my mailbox fill crap like this	-1

great magazine . i subscription 2 years ended 6-8 months ago . i paid $104 2 year subscription back then , but suddenly price us skyrocketed astronomically . i go any music store or borders/barnes noble buy each individual magazine anywhere $8/issue $9/issue typically , i never seen it more than $9/issue . however , suddenly subscription they like $13 issue , which outrageous . it not amazon doing either , i subscriber 2 years this same thing happened me . they asked me come back lower rate ( something like $99/year ) , which still $8.25 issue . sure that might bit cheaper ( 25 cents issue average price above ) than buying each one store , but i doubt anyone would want every single issue individually , especially tthat price . upside uncut far away best music/movie magazine world . i'd say 60-70% issues i would bought store when i subscriber . but until they begin printing magazine states , it just not worth subscription . writing magazine superb . brilliant varied writing throughout . each magazine big small book too , them i'd read good 80% magazine too ( even finding myself reading some articles artists i could care less , because articles so well written ) , but price way too high subscribe . it shame too . rolling stone nowhere close good uncut , although mojo strong , they can't hold candle it either . only blemish magazine itself ( all you who might want buy single issue ) covers tend repeat every 3-4 months , i mean how much beatles i read ( i'm upper 5% beatle freaks out there ) . still magazine well worth it , subscription price too incredibly high though recommend any circumstances . i would think this would great market move into us if i position . i don't think rolling stone could compete anymore . if it would make things cheaper , i would away " free cd " bonus too . aside few listens novelty it all ( free cd good incentive make me interested few years back ) , cd get old quick , after while i would toss them out after quick preview . summary : wait until/if price drops , but don't subscribe . it too expensive , much cheaper buy each magazine individually . magazine itself though 5 stars almost always great	-1

practicing photographer not collector , i've very disappointed bw few occasions it crossed my desk ( i've never subscription , so i'm basing this just few issues i've seen ) . quality wise , last issue i received poorly printed - it contained streaks through images rampant misregistration , among other things . paper unimpressive printing itself - line-screen looks quite course . full-colour magazine , it would fine , but one which everything monochrome , i would expect they would print stochastically or higher resolution etc . terms content , every time i've seen this magazine it filled work which typically very well-executed technically but un-innovative un-inspirational , least me . most it hobbyist/dedicated amateur variety , few capital-a artists or professionals . stereotypical nature bodyscape-style photos seem dominate , few examples conceptual , thematic or `high art ' work , i've never seen any fashion or photo-journalism either . we could use more non-technical photography magazines , but bw caters audience obsessed traditionalism imitation old masters such cartier-bresson ansel adams . ps : reading body copy set futura tight leading real pain	-1

( i not consider myself " right wing " , am registered independant , but like fair balanced coverage my news ) since beginning this decline , atlantic become more more just liberal magazine . bias also led , it always , less in-depth reporting , since they tend now ignore any aspect issue not support left bent .	-1
i first subscribed gq when it still quarterly ... issue only every 3 months . back then it primarily men fashion magazine . it sophisticated , useful classy filled clothing men could actually wear practical grooming tips , trends style . i suppose many ways it resembled ralph lauren print ad . now fashion relegated few pages back magazine men wearing things they seem found local flea market . nothing seems fit properly , patterns - plaids - stripes ... anything goes . it resembles homeless couture . odds ends nobody should actually wear . sure world changed . but fashion , good taste , quality timeless despite tweaking contemporary preferences . editors may feel grunge , hopeless edginess it own sake adolescent sloppiness sell issues . but they might surprised there huge pent up demand sophistication real style , both formal relaxed . i hope someone else picks up torch .	-1

when i first started reading this magazine back 2003 i thought " oooh what cool mag !!

this magazine chock full supplement advertisements . advertisements fashion magazines annoying , but supplements unhealthy dangerous . these ads may something target audience magazine ... it seems directed women who hard core weightlifting fitness , level competition . recent article magazine talking what percentage body fat too low women . some women body fat below 10% - i'm trying get mine below 30% . it just different fitness/weightloss league completely . i like magazines like fitness shape better because it sets more reasonable goals provides more reasonable advice . i substitute toast jam bagels cream cheese . i can't drink protein shakes breakfast lunch , eat 10 servings protein day , pop potentially dangerous pills . i am very disappointed this magazine ..	-1
i hopes this magazine would nice alternative others out there . moment i opened it , it felt so smug . i gave it chance read it cover cover ( april issue ) . but what finally me ( after read i could buy $800 blouse make me feel pretty after pregnancy stage , i could match my children shoes my jimmy choo finally i could buy my child latest $300 tricycle ) article entitled " normal " child who misdiagnosed autism . article discussed how distraught mother after her child diagnosed autism point she tried committ suicide . article ended fact child turned out genius . what point this article ? say thank god it wasn't true ? what those parents out there who autistic child , how this article make them feel ? article painful insensitive . there better ways spend you $10 than cookie	-1

i subscribed this magazine almost year now i become very skeptical much its advice . this advice seems heavily influenced its paying advertisers e.g. us dairy industry ( there always least one those annoying " got milk " ads ) not surprisingly , every issue there several articles magazine hype supposed benefits diet high dairy products ( e.g. milk cheese ) . however read many books nutrition , it become very clear me majority current research shows diet high dairy products actually very damaging your health - instance read china study colin campbell , extremely comprehensive nutritional study sheds great deal light us dairy industry its shady methods influencing public perception healthfulness its products . it well known there many better ways getting calcium etc into your diet than dairy but this magazine unfortunately blinded its advertisers ' paychecks . magazine also appears very similar prevention magazine which i also subscribed i would make same criticism . my advice stick reliable sources health like excellent " berkeley wellness letter " not supported or influenced advertisements drugs companies or powerful industry groups like us dairy industry	-1

i got this magazine gift , starting few months back . i really can't say i'm impressed . admittedly , i'm much more left leaning than this conservative ( sometimes very , very conservative ) magazine . dispite my bias , i still recognize good writing well made points - this magazine generally lacks both . this isn't say i've never seen good point or anything , they're just fairly rare . if you want read well-written , well-argued , conservative mag this isn't it	-1

this mag people who think they computer experts because they change out video card or follow directions changing os setting . shallow coverage , some lamest humor you ever come across . it nothing more then rehash what freely easily available internet . there nothing original this mag , ever . also it tends copy paste much issue 12 months earlier . all main articles nearly same every 12 months . don't believe me ? take two magazines 12 months apart compare them . reviews also weak . nearly every month you see : fastest system we ever tested !!!!! yaaaaawwwwwwnnnnn . who cares ? anyone who knows even slightest computers knows speed not most important attribute , even gamers . besides , it really matter system . 00005% faster their poor testing system then computer ? second star mr halfhills column . it only part consistantly interesting only person there real technical know-how . read toms hardware whatever tech news you want , learn how use search engines , skip this pointless mag	-1
i told this magazine good look design ideas . it isn't really , there isn't really much this magazine . it just tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked august september issues only things those two impressed me features elton john out africa fundraiser article julian mcmahon . rest it ads , not classy type ads make advertising tolerable vogue magazine , but same old ads you'll see anywhere else , they annoying . there several nonsense fashion articles likes kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one my professors would call it " plastic person syndrome " ) mark consuelos , waay too much jennifer garner her baby , other weird things , such trend designer cupcakes . i wish i kidding latter , but i am not , nor i $25 spend glorified cupcake just because it jessica alba favorite . there entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because stars it way here . despite size this magazine , there very little sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos same old same old , tips mimicking them . i am not interested becoming teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested seeing vanessa carlton pad . this magazine you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , subscription actually not year ( it says special issues count regular issues magazine ) your life ambition try cupcake bakery new york because some celebrity . this magazine mediocre best , worst part , it exact same fashion advice vogue . i went vogue because there substance their magazine , ads classy very chic . leave this one behind-it looks me like brain fluff read folks aol time warner .	-1

more more , all industry wants tell you what it you supposed like , ridicule anything we might consider guilty pleasure , if you indulge such thing , you ' shallow ' . music evolved past this attitude , no one believes this naked emperor anymore . oh yeah , their politics so mixed up , they don't even know what they believe anymore . i subscriber eleven years , my renewal notice came , i couldn't come up one good reason send it	-1
this used pretty decent music magazine . not best out there , but still decent . however , rolling stone taken huge nose-dive past ten or so years . i'm not sure i'd even really call it music magazine anymore . it more pop-culture magazine panders teeny-boppers . music magazine main focus should music , but rs over years started including more more articles tv shows , movies , politics , etc less less music ... especially less less good music . if you want magazine pop-culture go entertainment weekly . it , least , bit taste here there doesn't spout off politics . if i want politics , i'll read newspaper or watch cnn . i don't buy music magazines politics . i buy them music . if you want good music magazine , this isn't place look anymore .	-1

honest , i pick up this mag newstand 4 5 times year , but i hardly call myself fan . if you looking solid computer or tech mag , wired not you , it tries too hard hip trendy , but it group left/lib nerds too often come off lame borish . wired needs " rewired " meet needs modern tech community	-1
wired magazine proven me something it never even occurred me imagine : there level cynical , style-whoring , inaccurate , myopic snarkiness goes beyond merely " trading substance style . " wired consistently behind curve these days , but doesn't stop publication spinning every article like golden truth you too lame know . articles controversial subjects , one side routinely saddled straw man arguments so blatant artless i find them offensive even when i disagree parties who set up fall . just often , features which don't discuss contentious topic still edge them , making fun person , group , or idea way isn't enlightening or even humorous , let alone warranted subject matter . generally , wired mean-spirited it self-congratulatory . this attitude appeals primarily demographic tech wonks it industry tourists professionally personally deflated bubble burst , desperately trying assert their relevance relive their high-flying , know-it-all glory . any content easily outweighed sheer volume half-truths , shoddy reasoning , straight-up falsehoods which could easily revealed corrected casual investigation subjects treated pages choked high gloss , yuppie/genxer-targeted corporate mind-poison ( advertising ) . isn't world technology interesting magical enough without mixing spin , double-talk , factual misrepresentation presidential debate impotent , absurd bravado battle bot pre-match trash talk ? people know little enough how tech rules world how it , quite plausibly , save it . this magazine could evangelize technology promise educate its current future potential . instead it concentrates one-shots written style passes " hip " forwards attitude rather than message , emphasis sensationalism over accuracy , more common advertising than edification	-1
regardless quality magazine , it really annoying see oprah every single cover ! make it worst , she not pick " regular oprah shots " , instead you look every issue front cover ask yourself " how they take picture ? she doesn't even look like her ! " it if oprah telling all us " see how i look like ? " every month just new testimony oprah , money wonders . top , oprah personal thoughts , things , favorites , ideas , even more pictures all over few pages not advertisement . i still gave it 2 stars because time time you find good article , but bottom line question : this magazine or show off ?	-1
american photo began magazine devoted more photography than gear , alternative gear obsessed magazines like pop photo photographic . it evolved into magazine divides its pages equipment obsession cheesy quot ; glamourquot ; photography tries art delivers soft core porn . no stars	-1

i trashed issue when i saw shot trashy paris hilton . there enough nudity already your publication seeing sad piece work ( her ) cover just turned me off completely . sorry you thought her ' cover worthy ' . probably missed some fine articles . sincerely : deane everett	-1
i've this magazine past year used several tips , activities , posters , etc . however , i also gotten endless emails mailbox promoting products asking me renew way advance . this continues though i asked them stop . last three or four weeks , they've calling me telephone every day . this continues though i asked them stop . few good ideas each $6 issue nowhere near worth trouble dealing this harassment	-1
people magazine one worst expressions american life . instead makiing our own lives more meaningful exciting - which possible - people encourages us oogle fixate over people who essentially images , people we never meet , many cases people who very little going them . anyone really think britney spears anything say anything , or paris hilton barely aware her own existence ? it ever make whit difference your life how many times . lo engaged ( order get cover magazine ) or who demi moore grinding today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	-1
this magazine shows negative side black men . i find magazine embarrasement african-american community . it seems out all races men world , black men seem want display their lack self control , their love fancy cars , overpriced clothes , which no way helps create wealth our communities . i am also offended this magazine rarely shows black women front cover . until , black men understand this kind pathetic display supposed masculinity stopped , they always stopped police , passed over employment , looked down upon . i wish someone would create magazine black men which shows positive side black man such leaders their community , showing respect love their women , showing everything not hip hip !	-1
this magazine might good if you wealthy enough not work , time work out four hours day , your own chef , could go vacation six months out year , or could afford ( or cared ) fashion . otherwise don't bother . they sometimes decent or interesting article but they so few far it not worth it	-1

i started ordering glamour 2 months ago , honestly it huge disappointment me . there so many ads this magazine its unbelievable . ladies , my advice save your money different magazine .. i dont recommend glamour all .	-1
this magazine reads like inflight magazine : something airlines , careful not stir any scary adreneline rushes , put out lull their readers sleep . not controversy here . no thought-provocation . don't you wish someone out there would publish really good magazine books ? one featured meaty stories well-written reviews ? well , alas , this one ain't it . it dull bland . occasionally it offers up conservative book review neocon writer catherine seipp , who enlightening bill o'reilly ( , entertaining offensive laughably stupid ) so this sometimes cut dull . but someone here said bland i agree . avoid this one if you iq above 90 . pick up new yorker , atlantic monthly or harper if you like read intelligent writing . or , if you like romance novels , mysteries other badly written pieces fluff -- which all this magazine covers -- this might just thing you . i want my money back	-1
i not yet recieved this magazine , how could it reviewed	-1
i received this subscription trial , found it one most boring publications i ever read . last few issues i got , i wasn't even looking pictures anymore . there drawn-out descriptions their views finer things life , which very materialistic . end every issue there pictures quot ; real-lifequot ; wedding announcements . perhaps this fitting your local newspaper , but it struck me out place magazine	-1

if you're teenage guitarist want learn nickelback , green day , nu-metal songs , then this magazine you . there also some pretty good tips beginners time time . but last several years quality feature articles interviews gone steadily downhill , there far too many ads . many people said , sometimes it doesn't seem geared towards musicians all anymore . smarmy , " hipper than thou " rolling stone , spin , pitchfork media style writing seems taking over mag . other styles music such blues , country , jazz , etc , pretty much ignored . but like i said , if you're teenager you see it newsstand there song it you would like learn , pick it up , otherwise avoid this magazine	-1
okay , so touch never claimed anything other than what it : glossy tabloid . but just when you didn't think it possible american tabloid press dumb down any further , came touch weekly us weekly . all touch really bunch photographs . their writing slop , fit second graders , it doesn't go into much detail ( we all know how amazingly " accurate " these tabloids , anyway ) . want quality tabloid ? read hello ! magazine ( england ) . - donna di giacom	-1

heft page quality this magazine impressive , but it mostly advertising . very disappointing . it some useful info i enjoy reading it ( which why it got 2 stars me ) , but i definitely won't renewing my subscription	-1
if i could give this no stars i would . i bought this magazine because nickelodeon programs my sons favorite watch . i bet they banking when they made this sorry exuse children magazine . not even half magazine ad free !!!! i bought this keep my son busy flight , he looked it maybe two minutes . i wondered why , since he loves everything else nick , so i looked inside myself . boy i dissapointed . instead quality children material i hoped , it just ad after ad . i'm glad i only bought one issue airport , instead one unfortunate people purchase entire subscription before seeing it lack content . if you want great children magazine , go ladybug younger children cricket older children . they both high quality they aren't stuffed full advertisements like nick	-1
one year subscription this magazine not renew it . simply because its vulgar materialism extreme . they say we americans obese body , but magazines like this show many also obese when it comes materialism . page after page glossy ads things we not need . rooms full what amounts dust collections . sure they make pretty pictures , but who wants all ' junk ' probably no real sentimental value but more what someone else told us we need feel whole or successful . i recommend magazine dwell which more holistic approach place live also wont mean hours cleaning . someone who professes so concerned down trodden , oprah would better set better example living simply . how many homes one american need , when so many americans cannot afford even one	-1
i echo same gripe other reviewers voiced here : magazine covers same handful people week after week after boring week . how many times reader going see no talents such jessica simpson , lindsay lohan , tom cruise-katie holmes joke , most overrated , overhyped people all time brad pitt angelina jolie cover not get tired it ? it nice know what going certain celebrities once while but every single week ? you say " overkill ? " i'm glad i never got subscription this magazine . i picked it up every once while newsstand but stopped because i so sick tired reading overrated , overhyped glorified b-movie " actors " " actresses " who lucky one successful movie haven't anything value since . i picked up copy today sworn it off forever . don't waste your time or your money . - donna di giacom	-1
i don't know what heck going your subscription service . i bought this magazine my nephew back july 9th , he still hasn't recieved issue !!!! i am extremely disappointed your service . it should not take this long get magazine	-1
interview definitely different type magazine me- someone who usually reads business travel mags- it not quite what i expected . title like " interview " i read my first copy this magazine anticipating pages pages nothing but interviews . it turns out interviewing main focus magazine , but it not only one . there substantial space given fashion , movies , other areas , too . some these columns worth occasional look , but they failed grab my attention . writers seem play it safe , includes interview section . they don't ask many daring or controversial questions . they keep it simple , asking questions entertainer latest album or movie , without delving much into their personal lives . interview many general annoyances . my greatest complaint advertising arrangement contents . half pages each issue covered ads , fashion , liquor , beer , hair care items providing bulk advertising revenue . ads everywhere , majority front pages each issue . table contents buried , i find this very frustrating . contents starts interviews specific issue one page , then few pages later , proceeds remainder contents , which regular monthly features . what annoying you search table contents . it varies one issue next , falling somewhere first half . interview also varies greatly length . some issues short 80 pages while others more than 200 pages long . shorter issues use staples binding while longer issues bound more professional way , minus any metal . this magazine centers entertainers , fashion , music , like . you won't find any interviews politicians , businessmen , etc . interview sticks strictly entertainers , includes regular monthly columns . you won't find column business side music industry or film industry . you find only articles stars themselves . interview only saving grace photography . it would make nice gift those who enjoy fashion who like looking pages pages men women modeling fancy clothing . but many ways , photos overemphasized there isn't enough substance magazine . articles very shallow more eye candy than reading material . overall , interview sloppy cluttered too many ads make it worthwhile reading material . my subscription free , i'm thankful it . besides few nice photos clothing , there isn't much make this magazine worth cost .	-1
flipping through pages writer digest local bookstore , i found some its content particularly useful interesting , especially those trade writing could benefit novice writer . so i decided subscribe magazine it only then i realise problems persist this seemmingly wholesome helpful magazine . since i subscribed online directly through wd website jan 2005 , i received only few issues . first few months almost half year , i received no issues all . it only later then when i e-mailed them they manage get some issues through me . annoying thing even though i e-mailed wd few times this problem , they would reply apologetically saying they extend my subsription . how this tackle root problem ? if they could not assured its overseas subscribers consistent service , they should not offered ' overseas subscribers ' option . ironically , i received their letter asking renewal my subscription recently my home address clearly printed front letter . logistic problems aside , magazine its plus points . issues , there useful tips writers not simply craft writing , but also business spiritual aspect writing process well . occasional issues also features insights into lives authors give us idea how where they work , their opinions life areas which they derive their inspiration . all this range authors range genres . essentially , business writing also not left out . however , magazine not one fraught without problems . problem wd information presented readers too limited scattered . each article though containing valuable tips writing , not enough depth really improve work authors if they really implemented . addition , because its range , it also not provide what some writers really want consistently , which waste time them read if they subscribers . sometimes , it seem magazine purposely limiting information they give readers order encourage further buying future issues . this example , seen amount publishers ' addresses they offer . most , each specific article particular topic contains average 7-10 addresses . there nothing wrong this , but why would author want waste his time bits pieces such information when he just purchase writer market collection publishers(and agencies ) addresses collected into one ? ironically again , same company publish ' writer market ' collection which excellent quality annually . said , same problem - lack information depth , also seen advice tips it gives well . make matters worse , every issue usually cluttered plethora advertisements frustrating readers times . writers want organise their time information , not add it . if you want thinking subscribing wd , consider alternatives currently available . writing craft requires more common sense acumen than many would like think . however , if you not particularly concerned little information fed you slower dozes or not too worried little more untidiness your life , than this magazine might you . but your research first	-1
it took forever this magazine get address it also shipped week 2 weeks after magazine already stands . what point subscription if you get magazine later than everyone else ? i never order magazine amazon again , i'll go through actual magazine company instead	-1

there time when liberalism connotation deep thinking , tolerance , openness healthy , civil debate . no longer . harper perfect symbol all ails left . call this magazine " left leaning " farce . it doesn't lean ... it completely , totally , enthusiastically , blindly tumbles falls into " far left " swamp . tone often hysterically shrilly partisan , reflecting ongoing deafness disconnection leftist media elites towards mainstream america . quality writing feature selection declined precipitously through recent years . this rag credible now guardian , national enquirer , or , come think it , new york times ! save your money , lol !	-1
i'm big player pc games , but i also love reading thinking my favorite hobby . past few years i've living uk , but when i come us ( now i live here again ) i would pick up american version pc gamer . i say , i hope some you take my word this , u.k. publication light-years ahead this one . humour grown-up ( not mention actually funny ) doesn't drown magazine . it bigger , cover pages much better quality paper ink , articles neatly laid out ... added this , demo disc jam-packed dual sided dvd , archives patches , movies , free games , demoes , hardware guides .... not mention fact there many highly intelligent articles every month . case you're still feeling sceptical : uk version pc gamer original . it came us after it set up uk . lavished uk pc gamer praise , i think you read lines figure out where us version falls short	-1

please see tj-mccarthy review elsewhere here ; he , borrow phrase across pond , spot-on his comments . just this week i cancelled my 10-year subscription pc magazine . one thing not mentioned elsewhere new editor , jim louderback , dropped old tagline front cover , " independent guide technology " . i conjecture reason doing so this magazine no longer independent , fact , just marketing vehicle various products . if you like me you not like stealth marketing , stay away this publication	-1
i just cancelled my subscription recommended my daughter cancel one i bought my 14 year-old grandson . some reason ziff-davis marketers think full page ads selling sex videos appropiate pc magazine . ( dec 27 , 2005 , 122 if you want check it out ) . previous issues partial page ads selling " sex pheremones " which i could almost overlook , but full pages scantily clad lap dancers over line .	-1
this magazine great just keeping spirit . it filled many success stories . but hardly any those success stories include details led them into success . it also extremely geared towards franchising . every other article , every other ad franchising . i one year subscription this point i'm bored . i'll keep subscription , but it highly unlikely i renew next year . *** though one should check out their web site entrepreneur.com . you find it total opposite magazine , prove great wealth information	-1
my mom subscriber newsweek years , i'd flip through her copies . most material friendly towards powers ( although , not friendly enough according review soldier who thinks editors should jail . so much " protecting our freedoms " ) . anyway , since newsweek beholden big business advertisements , it won't much rock boat our corporate mafia owns . if people interested more honest , more critical views political economic system causing so much devastation world ( neoliberalism us empire other wealthy nations ) , then i'd recommend magazine . i'll never forget finding my mom floor devouring it articles range issues corporate media marginalize . also publishes articles interviews most-cited living author planet , noam chomsky ( figure i'm sure us soldier thinks should jail . although , chomsky recently spoke west point . so , even military waking up hard truths he brings ) .	-1
i would agree preivous comments state this magazine isn't worthy its title . i subscribed before reading review , i hoping find affordable psychology-based read , though some stories interesting i'm sure i'd able find them other magazines like vogue or cosmo . there plenty ads , probably more than stories . much like other reviewers when i first ordered it , it took forever first issue arrive , now its more regular but my subscription soon end no renewal course	-1
great magazine . i subscription 2 years ended 6-8 months ago . i paid $104 2 year subscription back then , but suddenly price us skyrocketed astronomically . i go any music store or borders/barnes noble buy each individual magazine anywhere $8/issue $9/issue typically , i never seen it more than $9/issue . however , suddenly subscription they like $13 issue , which outrageous . it not amazon doing either , i subscriber 2 years this same thing happened me . they asked me come back lower rate ( something like $99/year ) , which still $8.25 issue . sure that might bit cheaper ( 25 cents issue average price above ) than buying each one store , but i doubt anyone would want every single issue individually , especially tthat price . upside uncut far away best music/movie magazine world . i'd say 60-70% issues i would bought store when i subscriber . but until they begin printing magazine states , it just not worth subscription . writing magazine superb . brilliant varied writing throughout . each magazine big small book too , them i'd read good 80% magazine too ( even finding myself reading some articles artists i could care less , because articles so well written ) , but price way too high subscribe . it shame too . rolling stone nowhere close good uncut , although mojo strong , they can't hold candle it either . only blemish magazine itself ( all you who might want buy single issue ) covers tend repeat every 3-4 months , i mean how much beatles i read ( i'm upper 5% beatle freaks out there ) . still magazine well worth it , subscription price too incredibly high though recommend any circumstances . i would think this would great market move into us if i position . i don't think rolling stone could compete anymore . if it would make things cheaper , i would away " free cd " bonus too . aside few listens novelty it all ( free cd good incentive make me interested few years back ) , cd get old quick , after while i would toss them out after quick preview . summary : wait until/if price drops , but don't subscribe . it too expensive , much cheaper buy each magazine individually . magazine itself though 5 stars almost always great	-1

if i could give it zero or negative rating i would . when vibe introduced , it relevant , interesting magazine exposed me new alternative , rb hip hop artists . mag featured all kinds artists not just who hot right now , it also featured hard hitting expose articles relevant not only hip hop community but world . lately i've noticed it nothing more than fluffy version source . i hate lot new rap music that out didn't appreciate mags rappers i dislike cover . it me or it seem like since mimi took over , all female rb singers ' covers stories horrible ( we won't even discuss disgusting brandy cover) ! this magazine sucks now only time i check it out while i'm line grocery store . yes , subscription rates cut bone now but because quality supremely lacking . i'd advise curious check issues out newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money subscription	-1
i subscribed food amp ; wine while continuously disappointed . articles superficial side more importantly lot recipes product reviews not well researched they should . i experienced more than one flop trying their stuff . magazine tries very hard trendy pick up latest greatest cooking restaurant scene without careful enough deciding what actually important or meaningful trend rather than fad . this magazine can't hold candle quot ; bon appetitquot ; or quot ; gourmetquot ;	-1
i subscribe parents , parenting child magazine renew all but one child . it full ridiculous fashion spreads ( like i'm going spend $50 t-shirt my 15-month old ) , useless travel information near-advertising features newest , most expensive items i ' need ' my child . actual articles no better or worse than what other mags , i don't find there nearly much information magazine others . other reviewers said , it beautiful . however , it thoroughly impractical unless you're one those people who plan shop neiman your child ... not there anything wrong	-1
during 1960 , when my sister subscribed ahmm , stories mirrored fantastic television show ; stories primarily mysterious , creepy , unique , lots murders twist endings made show so great . now , majority stories magazine plain , uninteresting " detective " stories . i subscribed up until early 1980 , but stopped because same old boring " cops robbers " material . i tried read recent copy while waiting my aunt beauty shop , but switched one media rags instead when discovered ahmm hadn't changed . subscribe only if you fan pure " police " fiction	-1
i picked up issue this magazine last week because i wanted take picture cover girl into my hair dresser . after i got it home , i opened it up check it out discovered it most brainless magazine i ever seen . articles read like something " teen beat " , yet it filled adult material . there 10 articles " how please your man " " what guys like " even " sex workout " . these articles didn't contain any " real " advice -- just unintelligent babble . instance , any you know guys don't like it when you act unenthusiastic during sex ? hmmm , crazy . anyway , i don't see how anyone over age 16 could find any this stimulating , yet there too many articles one-night stands anyone under 18 read . but if you're still into taking quizzes looking " half-naked hunks " who barely hit puberty , then this magazine perfect . i would given this magazine 0 stars , but unfortunately it not option	-1
once thought women health magazine , cosmo taken twisted turn into pointless redundancy . one point , cosmo seemed must-have , water oxygen . more more lately , it seems magazine posing question " how we survive only water oxygen , still sexy while we ? " ocassionally , featured article faces issues things ranging eating disorders politics , but few far . they don't seem realize other side page eating disorder article , woman who wears size 0 still unsatisfied herself , thinking she must conform some " heroin-chic " fad . fun fearless female - articles real women who make real difference - great . it shines spotlight someone who not only beautiful successful , but enough education talent succeed world , without needing man . if magazine featured more these things , maybe it would worth my subscription fee . but tell me when last time you saw cover not featuring phrases " mind-blowing sex " , " how satisfy ( insert breathing life form here ) " , or " barely-there " , which seems refer not just underwear anymore , but everything . this isn't magazine women health anymore . it all how keep your man happy , while still conforming social standards fashion , weight , financial standings . i'm sorry , but " girl budget " can't afford $430 skirt , or uncomfortable shoes uncomfortable price $300+ . cater more real woman ; not one who only cares her relationship status , pant size , bank account	-1

don't waste your time even just simply flipping through this magazine newstand . trust me ... there no worthwhile patterns ( i mean ... just look what they choose grace their cover !!! ) i stopped hoping even half-way decent pattern come during two years or so . i seen litteraly only one knittable pattern last three years ( december 2004 i believe it ... lace cardigan beaded trim ) . even articles pointless . save your time money get subscription interweave knits or vogue knitting . or opt new magazine ( not available all newstands us ) called simply knitting , which imported uk . it amazes me this magazine even still production how horible it !!	-1

leading what ? innovation , quality articles , coverage , reader satisfaction ? no sir . profit advertising , volume sales , high percentual biased articles ? most likely . unfortunately , boost profits rodale press up anything , like rerun old articles save money misleading " special advertising " sections . if you into mt . biking , there better magazines out there ( mountain biking magazine not one them , course ) . if your thing road biking , sorry , there nothing else except racing magazines . we know , america vehicles waste energy , like high-powered cars , motorcycles boats ( just count number magazines them next time you stop your favorite bookstore )	-1
regularly read " bicycling " many years ( even when it called " bicycling ! " tasteless 1970s way ) , i find it surprising see how much quality magazine declined . spite all those people spending huge amounts money fancy equipment , " bicycling " become thinner thinner . it recently improved somewhat , after most editorial staff fired , sign dropping truly horrible marginal comments ( bike love so forth ) but it only suitable real neophytes . unfortunately , there no other single magazine covers racing , bike touring , test reviews , technique fitness north america , no matter how poorly . articles very short sometimes , well , just stupid . there very little cycling destinations or serious equipment tests . photography remains decent , but compared german magazine " tour , " example , " bicycling " pretty sad effort . if you read this , you access internet , which means you far better sources information draw . i am letting my subscription lapse advise you save your money . big disappointment , " bicycling " not advanced its readers	-1

i am 14 . i used read this two half years ago . it pretty good magazine back then , health tips , some real life stories , even things like sex questions ( which saying alot more than some these other magazines . ) it wasn't packed full teenyboppers cheesy glitter makeup . i liked it , if it still way it , i'd probably still reading it . but now , it gone . i read my last issue one year ago gave it up . it got way young me . all they talk celebrities ( aka jojo , good charlotte , hilary duff , jesse mccartney , usher , etc . ) alright , two them make some passable music , but what others ? they're talentless ! plus , i not see anything would appeal anyone over age 13 . they refer guys " hotties " " babes , " they just put same person every five pages ! there stupid quizzes tell you your kissing type or how psychic you ( seriously . ) half magazine huge posters your room airbrushed teeneyboppers . if you want magazine real substance , try seventeen ( highly reccomended ) , cosmogirl , teen vogue , maybe teen people ( i don't know , it kind lost its fun factor . ) some these magazines may not " appropriate " people read this magazine , but i personally think it better young girls learn hard honest truth world than obsessed pop stars latest mary-kate ashley gossip .	-1

subscription point view ( $12/yr directly ) this magazie decent value . while half information fluff ( looking back - 15 years innovation , etc . ) there some timely relevant information hard find easily consolidated way . focus not just laptops but mobile solutions - this includes peripherals , pdas , mobile phones among others . there some opinion ( riaa vs sirius ) but focus seems vendor/advertiser driven . example , cover story mar 2006 issue first four core duo notebooks . they review centrino duo notebooks acer , dell , gateway hp . they run benchmark tests provide charts , etc . fairly useful info . except they don't give information consistently . weight dell laptop not even mentioned while those others . they mention few cons each notebook but it gently without strong opinion . two four systems reviewed selected editors ' choice . other two still rated well . there no single table compares them all single view . you get feeling , they trying please advertisers avoided any direct head-on comparision multiple products . i disagree their choices well . how could editors ' choice 6.6 lbs laptop acer average battery life just because it offers some value ? same mar 2006 , there review windows treo 700w ; showdown slim phones moto razr v3c samsung mm-a900 ; short test nokia pocket internet appliance kodak first dual-lens digicam ; wifi routers ; list restaurants business travelers ; etc . $1/month , i recommend this anyone who travels lot looking quick update mobile computing world . if you want in-depth technical info , stick toms hardware or other web sites	-1

someone who recently become more interested healthier , organic way life , i decided check out several magazines subject matter . many not strike my fancy . example , i found organic style magazine little too fashion product-oriented my taste , while mind , body , spirit fitness seems little too redundant doesn't cover natural organic living all . natural health , however , falls somewhere , covering nice array topics including fitness/diet , natural remedies , beauty , food/recipes . someone who not interested explicitly holistic medicine naturopathy , i appreciate diversity this magazine offer . though many articles cover ideas products aren't entirely natural or organic , i still find them useful . many items articles , though not all , vegetarian-friendly well eco-conscious , which i appreciate . one my few complaints articles short , sometimes merely " glossing over " many topics . however , if one piques my interest , it decent jumping off point further research . though i can't compare previous version magazine everyone else seems preferred , i only began pick this up my local whole foods market last year , i say i am impressed what natural health offer it readers . sure , there several ads plaguing pages , but i still feel though there far fewer advertisements than many magazines shelves today . besides , some ads led me decent products i would not known otherwise . furthermore , this price , how anyone really go wrong	-1

i've pw subscriber reader ( even when not subscriber ) years . i've also tried various other writers ' magazines , such writer writer digest . latter two fine when i just beginning dip into freelance market , just beginning look publishers first manuscripts , but when i gained more experience , i soon realized those just didn't make cut anymore . articles too often repetitive geared towards such elementary basics i no longer gaining new insights . pw next step up . pw provides advice , inspiration , informative interviews , current resources more experienced discriminating writer . bimonthly issues include articles , detailed listings markets , contests , grants , helpful , relevant ads . price , this best magazine available today writer who portfolio already underway keeping ear ground more , staying up date what rumbling literary world . its up-to-date information , i've able leave others aside , including old bible , writer market , which , unfortunately , obsolete moment it off presses . highly recommended writer wanting more .	1
there not many magazines specializing political commentary really any good these days . so many them geared toward political party , instead concentrating issues most important . " reason " magazine exception , its motto " free mind implies free market " vice versa , it proven publication one count objective analysis under umbrella motto . authors who write it definitely their biases , but they attentive these biases , usually anticipate answer objections ideas which they expound . many times this reviewer heard authors editors reason " socially liberal " but " fiscally conservative . " this kind description almost implies their thinking mere hybrid liberalism conservatism . but this description incorrect , content articles reason consequence general belief among its authors editors freedom , means first freedom mind , moral universal , regardless place context which one finds oneself . `social liberalism ' reason , if one call it , manifests itself tolerance ideas one finds repugnant . `fiscal conservatism ' reason manifests itself belief freedom not subject arbitrary coercive government no qualms using deception or actual force collect taxes , impose censorship , or generally violate individual rights . there always many fine articles written reason diversity topics . advocacy biotechnology refreshing reflects common sense attitude very rare political debate this branch technology . one also find commentary government waste , propaganda , torture , " war " drugs . addition , many book reviews included books relevant issues magazine wants address . one only hope reason stays afloat delivers many more insights years come . magazine both barometer freedom thought well its creation .	1
jeff goldblum character " big chill " said he couldn't write article longer than average person could read during , er , " trip library " ( wink , wink , nudge , nudge , know what i mean ? ) . writers details seems same marching orders . these hectic times , maybe that not so bad . articles i read well researched nicely bite-sized . i actually finished entire magazine pm mail delivery breakfast next day . topics they covered my first issue ranged fashion health concerns . , again , they cover topics very few , well-written pages . i think models look like under-fed children but my age , could tunnel-vision ( grey hair , i remember filmore east , you get picture ? ) . my suggestion , take look . it magazine interesting voice it may you .	-1

inc . magazine publication designed guide small businesses their path prosperity . inc ., you get timely advice taxes , marketing , financing , many other important considerations challenges business owners face every day . probably strongest point inc . way it presents important information readers . authors this magazine get directly point . they don't waste your time petty discussions attempts soften blow undesirable fact . even when news bad , like regulations , taxation , etc ., inc . lets you it direct manner . this good , because i get annoyed magazines try ease reader into hearing some unwelcome news then try downplay facts . inc . writers direct , i respect them . if there some criticisms made this magazine , i think only two : lack articles geared toward startup businesses tendency magazine highlight success stories , while nice read , present personal success little out reach most business owners . inc . designed small businesses already established need some guidance growth . this fine , but i would like it little better there more articles getting new business off ground . , every now them magazine goes off tangent interviews someone who very rich . again , this ok , but i would prefer read ordinary people who only moderately well- off because these stories individual level success they portray more realistic . still , inc . very good publication small business owners . it provides some good , timely advice how help your young business grow how handle legal issues concerns . price subscribe low , too , making inc . magazine must owners small , growing companies .	-1

quite frankly this only cooking magazine i ever subscribed i actually looked forward using receiving every two months . i like it so much i am writing my first amazon review ! format magazine makes it easy follow recipes - they always printed two pages across each other - unlike some other posters i prefer black white format so paper thicker doesn't tear easily . tear away ads ( their own products ) outside magazine means usable portion doesn't take up much space my shelf . recipes easy follow usually clear . when they include specialized ingredients there usually also substitution listed . their product reviews terrific - i wish i hadn't wasted so many dinners bad whole wheat pasta . my only gripe , someone who not dishwasher , great number bowls kitchen tools recipes require . i made least half recipes magazines , many several times , which no small feat " flexitarian " who never meat main dish .	1

i'm usually not one taking chance new magazines ( especially if they've shoved down public throats or oprah winfrey endorses it ) but this one instance where oprah gets major-league credit putting her faith money rachael ray . i impressed magazine layout - not too elementary nor too complicated - recipes contained within delicious easy prepare ( you won't go searching every speciality shop country ingredients , either ) . i also like how rachael let readers her italian wedding african safari honeymoon . unlike other celebrities , she didn't let us know too much information ( thank you ! ) i'm sure her recommendations trattorias , cafes , hotels tuscany worth time easy budget . just because she doesn't initials besides her name culinary degree ( she not only one food network lacking this ! ) , rachael spent her whole life restaurants food she learned same tricks trade fusion chefs network know . this definitely worth look i'm seriously considering ordering subscription .	1

my initial reaction this magazine this magazine huge , full ads . i also read vogue , though , honest , less ads it . convieniently avoids snotty air harper bazaar vogue while same time avoiding trashy how sex up your man type articles cosmopolitan , redbook , marie claire , it also avoids rampant celebrity worship instyle . this magazine excellent layouts , what i've read thus far , excellent-and very different-stories . regular vogue reader , i'm used reading older designers like coco chanel , versace prada lines , reading small smattering socialites , like aerin lauder , paris hilton , jemma kidd , victoria traina . what different it profiles new modern . article september issue profiled kate spade her new line . other articles talked , almost sarcastically latest exploits socialites , meanwhile talking , article aptly titled " bag called it " trend statement purses their proper place . also similar vogue addition good layouts , it even better photography , there no photoshopped death photos here , if they , this student can't find them . what i like most its sarcastic wit , something lost most magazines , many which these days assume everyone wants learn latest way sex up their man , worship teri hatcher , or read dumbed down articles .	1

this light colorful newspaper . i remember when it first came out . idea it would national newspaper cover united states whole . it way gives local news regards all ' sections ' country . reporting itself clear very readable . paper lacks weight depth . it lot variety its features , clearly attempts entertain reader somehow make news more palatable . it not great newspaper but it often features fine reporting . there times when it better job than more prestigious papers .	-1
one funniest magazines around . recent article , weekly standard proposed massively expanding irs help pay massive debt budget deficit . which group " weekly standard " say should targeted this increased irs presence ( massive increase tax rate - some 100%) ? entertainment industry . reality tv show contestants , teen-pop singers like . article noted normally massive taxation would hurt industry , but all people really want fame , go all out get their 15 minutes fame , industry would continue ( i'm curious if o'rourke realizes tax would applied similar writers ) . o'rourke article provided readers alternate inaugural address bush ( subtitle : " what if george . bush weren't compassionate conservative . . . " ; quote : " media say i won election strength moral values . if other fellow become president , would media said he won election strength immoral values ? " ) . all seriousness , this magazine very clear detailed neo-conservative look issues ( neo-con ? - interestingly , it would appear many writers used liberals ) . magazine not always present just conservative perspective , not always agree bush . recent article current liberal , ex-communist british writer his reaction george galloway testimony before us senate . editorial recent issue all dictator uzbekistan , us ally war terror . editorial notes toleration this dictator his brutality undermine bush current foreign policy . it should noted magazine not seem journalists , few staff writers , most appear called " contributing editors .

i've off-and-on subscriber si since i kid . i've grown love magazine idolize few staff writers . despite best , magazine far perfect . lately , i've found many articles deal things i , many sports fans , probably don't care . they give too much coverage pro football when it season , even though i've noticed football coverage among worst magazine . there few writers who i can't stand ( die austin murphy ! ) some who think they better than they really ( rick reilly ) , some who underappreciated ( steve rushin ) . however , some finest reading i've ever sports illustrated . there some stories stick you years . si beats crap out terrible espn magazine , which seems more interested comedy than sports .	-1

when weird tales revived around 1988 , i sorely disappointed direction editorial staff taken . it too " progressive " not enough like old wt so many us afficionados knew loved . lin carter great thing going four paperback issues he came out under zebra imprint early 1980 . unfortunately , he not allowed continue . his idea keep flavor old weird tales alive , he it very well . then several years later comes schweitzer/scithers/betancourt wt , my goodness it sad see aura gone . gradually , though , wt seemed come put itself somewhat more direction " old-fashioned " ' zine it its heyday ( 1920's-1930 ) , although editor darrell schweitzer would probably disagree this observation . anyway , wt sports great covers now , good stories , good book reviews , interesting editorials . i must say i miss s.t. joshi always very entertaining book reviews , but we can't everything . scott connors ' forthcoming reviews surely entertain , douglas winter . all fantasy lovers should buy this magazine support cause fantastic literature , especially dark fantastic ; there so few outlets this kind now whispers weirdbook , not mention long gone forgotten fantasy , no longer published . good job , mr. schweitzer , whether you realize it or not , your magazine become more cozy , old-style , aesthetically pleasing magazine , more true tradition original weird tales , thanks no small part wonderful covers graced it last 13 or 14 years	1

revolver competing magazines heavy metal magazine world hit parader circus . i bought all three these magazines several times , revolver my final judgement revolver only magazine good enough subscribe . other two i still buy occasionally , but only wallpaper ( i cut out pictures bands magazines hang them my room . ) this magazine , way , like combination circus blender magazines ; it combines best aspects both . revolver still plenty great pictures , but it also much longer much better written than circus . it not quite long or stuffed full information blender , but make sure you note revolver only reports one genre ( heavy metal ! ) whereas blender could ( theoretically ) report every genre ( rap , pop , rock , etc . ) chances , if hard rock band ( especially big name hard rock band ) or already released c.d. , revolver story it . stories/reports very entertaining but they also informative sometimes lesson learned them . if it cover story , interview band also included ; if it not cover story , writer integrates quotes answers band into article , anyways ( even though it not formal interview ) . revolver writers frequently go tour band ( i.e. lamb god ) . case , they take reader backstage , tour bus , concert ( rundown show ) . when i first started reading this magazine , there sexual theme it . there would picture " hot babe " t-shirt , one side poster would woman-usually half-naked-in sexual pose . past year or so , revolver phased out ( probably appeal broader audience ) . i sometimes miss pictures " hot babes , " but this way there more room real heavy metal pictures . yet , even though sex isn't theme anymore , revolver probably bit too sophisticated anyone younger than teenager . plus , there usually profanities ( mainly " word . " ) so , i would say this magazine ages 13 up . monthly articles : -cover story-3 or 4 other biggish stories- " fresh blood " column ( where small biography given band you probably haven't heard of)- ask vinnie ( column where readers write questions , pantera/damageplan drummer vinnie paul gives advice)- hard rock news notes- black death metal news notes- " studio " ( update bands currently recording new music)-free poster ( middle magazine , there fold-out poster one or two bands . ) poster isn't very wide , but it two pages long-free music downloads- " ink spot " ( story musician favorite tattoo)- " favorite sh*t " ( interview musician , questions such " what your favorite color ? " )-joke band ( revolver just recently started doing this)- reviews ( reviews . . ' , music dvd , video games)pros : -- plenty good pictures free poster -- professionally written well known writers ( yet it not too intelligent teenagers) -- edited well ( i haven't found any mistakes or typos)-the " fresh blood " column usually introduces me band i haven't heard , but i should probably check out -- revolver accredited well known enough allowed go tours bands first interviews -- news columns ( both mainstream underground metal bands)-the stories always quotes band report -- free music ! ( revolver started doing page gives reader password , which he/she then access free music downloads online . ) -- no stupid questions interviews ( they ask up date questions , sometimes- i.e. interview puddle mudd-the writers aren't afraid ask daring , cutting questions) -- " studio " segment always informative -- helpful , reliable reviews ( they don't automatically praise every heavy metal . . ) cons : -- if you're up date your music news web sites , news columns shouldn't really anything new you . -- not all . . ' reviewed ( they give rundown c.d. article band , but . . ' bands cover magazine aren't usually reviewed . ) -concerts aren't reviewed-my biggest gripe it only issued once month . bottom line , if you're metalhead , this best magazine you get ! it more than well worth ten dollars you spend years worth entertainment	1

i use this magazine my three kids ( ages 9 , 11 , 13 ) who homeschooled . they love magazine because it makes history more fun than dry textbooks they get really experience what life like certain era . each article includes discussion questions , activities , movies , web sites additional books read . what so great this when one kids really interested something , they jump off explore more their own - perfect self-directed learning . it saves me time tracking down this stuff . some more memorable articles ones like " how storm castle " , " hobo signs depression " , " success ancient china " " how chocolate conquered europe " - definitely not standard-fare topics , but fun nonetheless . my kids getting hooked history result ! sure , it $5 per issue , but it pretty thick ( 60+ pages ) no ads . you check out sample issue online their web site see if it right your kids	1

i long time subscriber vogue knitting , it one few us knitting magazines really fashionable knitting patterns . i am germany , where there lots knitting magazines really chic patterns , i missed when i moved us . however , i find content vogue knitting really fluctuated - sometimes it packed great designs , sometimes , it just too far out there wasn't single pattern i wanted knit . i stopped my subscription while . then editor changed now magazine somewhere middle - not too funky , yet still chic fun . i still enjoy reading it every once while . after my daughter , i changed my subscription family circle easy knitting , since vogue knitting not carry any patterns babies or kids , which i really find shame . i even wrote letter editor saying this major omission . especially because it very hard find chic elegant kids knits magazines - not those acrylic yarn patterns bears them ! german magazines great job some unique , but still fun kids designs . if you want very trendy knitting magazine uses whole range yarns ( some very expensive ) , then vogue knitting magazine you . if you looking elegant knits more functional , but still challenging , i would suggest interweave knits rebecca ( english version german magazine ) , both carry some really interesting challenging patterns . if you kids , there isn't much out there , i would suggest family circle easy knitting , also rebecca kids issue once year , which should not missed	-1

there two good ways tell what audience which woodworking magazine aimed . first type advertising , second how much skill projects expect you . it pretty clear right away woodworker journal server home woodworkers who already moderate skill . advertised ' big toys ' run 500 1500 dollar range , although there couple high end combination machines adds well . articles expect you know how use tools trade but not sure ' best ' way something . recent issue makes study intarsia backed high chair some interesting joinery , instructions making genuinely exotic angle jig table saw . writing solid reasonably illustrated , but they devote little space what you should already know , which make these projects stretch tyro . magazine very tool oriented . there isn't lot space devoted hand tools or history . expect articles comparing nail guns helping you decide whether stationary or bench top equipment right you . however , traditionally manual tasks like finishing also receive their due . i found woodworker journal suited me quite well , i expect continue reading it	1
i love this magazine it helps me pick out style when i need it	1
least far magazine itself concerned , but cardplayer vastly superior website up minute tournament coverage , email , ton other things . all online definitely worth checking out regular basis , however . i just read two hardcopy issues when i vegas i liked features , pro coverage , interviews , book reviews . should you miles nearby cardroom jones advance your knowledge then you so rather passively reading publication closely follows pro game	1
workbench magazine aimed do-it-yourself type people who like work their own home improvements save money process . this publication presents dozens woodworking ideas home improvement few hobby , plenty instructions diagrams make sure you get it right . most workbench focused exterior one home . you page through issue , you notice plenty articles building wooden decks , new porches , other decorative ideas improve outside appearance your residence . there few projects inside , usually dealing construction cabinets , bed frames , other things . but most part , articles deal outdoor woodworking tasks . i like photos this magazine because projects always look so fancy . they perfectly constructed , clean , well- finished they make you want get off your booty start working your own home . many cases , articles this magazine tend make things seem little too easy when , reality , these projects often take many days or even weeks finish . but end results worth it not only financial standpoint , but also sense pride you feel job well . workbench little more expensive than other magazines , but those who enjoy working their hands , this publication worth cost . some effort some good ideas , you greatly improve your home appearance value some new outdoor trimmings . workbench shows you exactly how get job plenty woodworking projects enhance your residence inside out .	-1

i've subscriber outside magazine several years , it seems go through its ups downs terms strength its editorial content , especially regarding political side environmentalism . it still easily most informative magazine out there lovers outdoors , but just note focus active , not armchair , appreciation nature . beyond occasionally great always heavily knowledgeable product reviews , key strength this magazine well-written strongly researched articles outdoor issues concern , not just america but around world . outstanding recent example , among many , concerns economics environmentalism conservative western u.s. this type strong conservationist reporting usually only found otherwise books . other more whimsical articles just fun read those off-kilter interests , such recent pieces urban rock climbing or sauna fanatics finland . many other articles could classified more travel/tourism than adventure , but accompanying photography always top-notch , editors knack finding out-of-the-way hidden treasures around world ripe discovery adventurous . ( but other hand , magazine could faulted contributing recent trend hyping previously unknown outdoor paradises since become crowded , such molly sods wilderness west virginia . ) personally , i would like see little less focus expensive vacations extreme sports fanatics take hard-to-reach nations , more what folks more realistic means ( amounts free time ) humble parks forests near home . but despite its habit losing its focus times , i continue fan outside years come , might just travel some those hyped exotic adventure locations .

i ordered back issues this magazine ebay dealer uk after spring 2006 issue came out i am sold not just burda plus but berlin fashion designers well- women , anyway , make lovely , flowing but not " girly " clothes very wearable - think eileen fisher or flax but darker , richer colors , fibers textures , slightly more " fit " more interesting shapes wider variety -- not just same few repeated again again . clothes decades , not season -- patterns here ! least some them , designers like evelyn brandt , doris strietch ( berliner ( female ) whose name escapes me moment , but whose clothes i deeply admire . ) fit better than most american pattern companies - especially pants . if you make one garment each issue subscription more than paid itself . good info sizing patterns up or down back issues i recently received - keeping proportions if using " petite " or " tall " pattern if you neither . pattern directions themselves less than enlightening , though - perhaps " non-fluent " would best description their translation . breathless tone ( lots exclamation points !!!! ) editorial content seems bit much such " smart " clothes , but we're not buying this elegancce writing ! reviewer complained delivery delay . this only published january july . if you missed subscribing time last issue print run gone , you wait until next one pubs . print runs sell out . i attest	1

( when you finish , run your iron over clean terry facecloth absorb any wax seeped out ) . when fusing , hold till wax paper clings it look bit " bubbly " . edited add : use highlighter pen mark lines you tracing off . it help you " see " correct pattern peice correct size spaghetti trail master pattern centerfold . tracing : burda patterns don't come seam allowance so i added after tracing my patterns . using sharpie straight edge long runs i traced off my desired size patterns which look like multicoloured spaghetti lines all over newsprint center . all those lines . here where my wax paper tip comes handy . i've tried tracing paper , even interfacing but multiple lines burda magazine pattern too much those usual tracing papers or interfacing . you need something much more see thru . wax paper ! cheap , almost transparent , sturdy won't bleed sharpie marker ink . burda doesn't print one sided pattern masters so you trace . you can't just sacrifice rest patterns cut yourself one only since other peices likely printed back . remember add your seam allowanceonce i cut out my pattern ( write all notes what size , layout , darts etc pattern ) i put my pattern pieces manila envelope . pattern envelopes home made patterns work best some labelling . i put magazine ( june 05 ) page # ( 34 ) model i'm copying size , yardage i require any sewing notions or extras ( zippers , interfacing , 17 buttons , yada yada)maybe due bit obsessive such things i sketch line drawing envelope note saying , skirt , pants , jacket or whatever garment . my drawing isn't perfect but i try include front back view major seams darts drawn . it useful . i keep them normal household file folder , since manila envelopes fit perfectly . file under jacket , dress , skirt etc . or year . there , i hope helps . this well worth getting even if you never sew single stitch magazine .	1

play definitely breath fresh air someone who truly engulfed second-hand suck . years magazines like egm , gamepro ( shudder ) , only multi-platform magazines i would read . i later became tired their increasing ridiculousness , both content reviews , so after suggested i check out this magazine many fellow gamers i decided , hesitantly , so . i mean how different could multi-platform magazine ? very . not only am i captivated wonderful choice cover art each month ( amazon should change display cover over shadow colossus one ) , but pages size publication more professional than any gaming mag currently out . ( i admit not read game informer , due their paper mario : thousand year door fiasco , i never intend . ) i could only think myself stupid not heeding words others sooner . my first copy issue 39 , march 2005 , sega choice cover main content month . wow , there content . nice spread sega upcoming lineup , interviews company people/developers captivated me more . reviews awesome , still awesome well , sometimes spilling over 2 pages more frequently than " competitors . " i knew right away this what i looking : magazine liked all kinds games wasn't afraid show it both previews reviews , magazine not insult my intelligence , nor choice games . i not seen one word " kiddie " or " baby game " attack because colorful sprites , or lighthearted content . quite contrary , magazine seems ardent its protection 2-d games , games just fun regardless how they look ; something very welcome this day age gaming . i also like how they some biting criticism , but still seem upbeat . take their 2005 e3 wrap-up issue where they criticized everything show itself , phantom games , specs next-gen hardware , but still positive things say them . not only , but magazine , once again , incredible coverage . how some interviews people such : hideo kojima ( metal gear ; boktai ) , tomonobu itagaki ( doa ; ninja gaiden ) , atsushi inaba ( viewtiful joe ; okami ) , koji igarashi ( castlevania ) , michael ancel ( rayman ; beyond good evil ; king kong ) , takao miyoki ( phantasy star universe ) , masato maegawa ( ceo treasure) ? simply incredible . not mention their brilliant cover story shadow colossus interviews developers . i cannot say enough how good this magazine . if i could use my years knowing gaming mags , sum up what magazine like , i would say it like cross now gone next generation , gamefan its anime section -- but very much mind its own . ( those worried anime section , it located back , so you won't miss out anything gaming related if you choose skip over it . ) i seriously implore you give it chance , even if you fan other magazines . go your local bookstore look through it , you don't purchase it , just see yourself . hopefully , you'll experience true difference play	1

i used love this magazine . it still some excellent articles , but it true there way too many filler issues now top 100 lists things i no interest ( resort hotels , spas , expensive travel agents ) . however , flip side , it never talks down reader - audience assumed well travelled somewhat sophisticated - which i appreciate . i checked out nat geographic traveller hoping it would like cn traveller old , but although it nicer photography ( few gratuitously scantily clad female shots ) , it seemed much more mainstream - like i already many quot ; dream tripsquot ; befor i hit my 30s information also seemed much shallower . i like geo , but i struggle through french it lot more expensive	-1

i subscribe few magazines , most which somewhat longwinded tedious . progressive not follow path . it also very informative magazine . example , one article i learned following items democrat john kerry :( 1 ) he gets good bit money telecommunications industry lobbyist " mintz , levin , cohn , ferris , glovsky , popeo " . ( 2 ) " he sponsored legislation help telecommunications companies buy up public airwaves . " ( 3 ) he thinks " we should all `smart cards ' - electronic ids our health history encoded them . " ( 4 ) he " voted every free trade pact come his way senate since cold war . " ( 5 ) afl-cio backing kerry even though he declined answer there questionnaire trade . all these came one article : " triumph bland " ruth conniff ( page 12-13 issue april 2004 ) . if your like informative information , check out this magazine	1

i reader 20 years , but am considering canceling my subscription ( i this once before when it became vanity fair look-alike under tina brown ) . i think writing exceptional . my complaint issues become thinner ( embarrassingly small " double-issue " mid-august ) . articles shorter edited end bottom page , which sometimes breaks article flow . it full advertising , which pays bills , but now seems squeezed out some writing . articles also not seem essential they past . political writing great movie reviews lane denby best you find .	-1
i subscribing new yorker five years now , it very enlightening experience . new yorker its part covering big news stories , but it not really news magazine . perspectives unique ( admittedly lean left ) , kind you're not likely get elsewhere . authors use first person because they tend part stories they're covering . take jon lee anderson , probably most credible reporter covering middle east today . his " letters " various cities involve accounts his meetings locals leaders . other segments more like npr stories -- unique perspectives largely uncovered topics aren't time-sensitive . you'll get in-depth looks into developments medicine , law , architecture , etc ., otherwise wouldn't get your radar unless you profession . , writers incorporate " larger questions " stories focused recent events . like malcolm gladwell recent account playwright who plagiarized material former article written him . he parlayed his personal struggle into good summary legal ethical positions use or development one person idea . i grown look forward reading fiction selection each week . sometimes i don't like piece , but i enjoy getting chance read writers i normally wouldn't those i normally would . additionally , magazine added more dedicated issues -- most recently " food " issue , addition standbys like " style " " fiction " issues . i loved " food " issue , especially one writer account search truly authentic pasta involved work night mario batali kitchen trip italy . i enjoy balance hard news , balanced interest stories , arts new yorker provides . i began my subscription get different perspective than what i got local southern news , i keep it same reasons many more	1

popular photography imaging well-deserved reputation one best photography magazines available , yet it not nearly well-written or informative it prior its merging modern photography ( if you interested checking this out , compare current issue one written back 1970 example . ) . it remains useful its product reviews , but these - especially lenses - tend rather subjective , not nearly critical potential user might wish . worse yet avid amateur or professional photographer , articles tend aimed towards novices , or least written though they would understood best only novices . only redeeming features herb keppler thoughtful insights photography occasional articles which well written edited . otherwise , i would recommend taking look other photography magazines , most notably shutterbug , which i found more useful	-1
i subscribing this mag couple years , think it one best gaming mags available . i several different consoles , appreciate they review games all platforms . i like rating system ( 1-10 ) instead too-hard-to-pin-down 1-5 , find reviews well written objective . while i gaming years , i am not necessarily versed computer lingo , but i never feel like idiot after reading this mag ; writing erudite but very easy understand . i read several different gaming magazines each month , feel this magazine strikes exactly right balance more serious more frivolous gaming magazines industry . one suggestion : if you gamestop or affiliated store your neighborhood , get your subscription through them . $15 you receive 12-year subscription , card gives you 10% off used games these stores , well extra 10% trade-in value your used games ( sometimes there coupon month mag upgrade 20% both ! ) .	1
there few magazines writing serious writers need read . " poets writers " one them . it literary bent , but avoids nose-in-the-air attitude . it practical educational , pleasingly presented . favorite factor me long feature articles culture writing . issue out now , there two major articles . one author stuart dybek his fiction pulls his experience growing up chicago colorful south side . other writing contests , dealing how ethical they run , view literary judges , when writer should considering entering one . secondary articles informative useful , whether you want learn promoting your book , doing online workshops or understand trends driving industry . contests , incidentally , big part pw value . magazine tells you who won , which contests/grants currently accepting submissions . pw careful screen which contests listed , ensuring only legitimate ones make it through editors . writing itself interesting . it not always true writing magazines fun read . it should , case pw , everything engaging . pw design clean . it looks like what small press literary magazine should look like . typography layout not pretentious or overbearing , but get job . it never work read this magazine . i fully recommend " poets writers . " you better informed writing writers , just like titles implies . anthony trendleditor , hungarianbookstore.co	1
we subscription 2001-2004 . last year subscription , magazine came focus more more politics , most political articles written conservative perspective or assuming neoconservative world view background . letters disagreeing anything robert kaplan wrote rarely , if ever , printed . ( though i know fact they received them ! ) we dropped our subscription picked up new yorker instead . conservatives however may want take new look this magazine . reviews suggesting it liberal must based pre-2003 reading . occasional issues we bought since dropping our subscription confirm conservative slant persisting . quality writing still reasonable however , it explores issues depth ( albeit one side )	-1
mr. hayek apparently despises free thought . furthermore , his ignorance libertarian philosophy clear ; discounting his opinion appropriate . i'm guessing he republicrat finds socialist ideas found corrupt two party system satisfying . funny considering his namesake , frederich hayek , one greatest libertarian thinkers all time one my personal heros . but , i digress : reason magazine my mailbox every month well over 20 years i would buy lifetime subscription if i could . not every issue five star issue , but whole reason most interesting periodical market . said , reason dropped notch quality ever since brilliant virginia postrel left editor post several years ago . she true intellectual kept reason consistently high level . i still love read my issue every month while i don't always agree positions i am always stimulated	-1

i lean left politically looking magizine inform get me thinking . i tried several others , including nation , settled subscribed mother jones . while magazine leans left , it so more informed intellectually honest way , opposed rah rah banner waving way . it mixes bit more social commentary investigation opposed political propoganda endless articles how defeat republicans . if you're interested solid investigative , left leaning magazine , check out mother jones . check out their web site , they some free content additional content available if you get magazine	1
mother jones informing us trade agreements how we save our jobs usa . when unions try fight corporations order get health benefits their employees not take cuts their paychecks company threatens leave . saying : " like it or you won't any jobs all . " this isn't fair trade , it going " cheap labor " overseas . this magazine getting message out i love it . they exposing truth nafta cafta . we all need more information like this so we save economic future our country . if we not , we consumer , not earn enough pay items we buy . this means goods sit warehouses , company stock goes down stock market crashes like 1929 . we need fix it now . read this magazine .	1
excellent independent research ! investigative journalism its best . it neither liberal nor conservative publication , neither republicans nor democrats spared . politicians make lot claims , mother jones looks beyond their words see if they actually put them into action . you see when you read mother jones , many politicians ( both democrats republicans ) not " put their money where their mouth . " also , ignore reviews saying it biased . apparently , they consider facts inconvenient run counter their beliefs biased . what interesting if they came across article mother jones supported their beliefs , they agreed , then they would probably say article impartial fair . hey , truth hurts sometimes . finally , reviewers claiming this liberal magazine because it talks bush so often misguided . mother jones so many articles bush because he makes so many claims says so many things not supported his actions . he easy target . they articles kerry others too .	1
one my favorite magazines one deserves wider reading . i love breadth coverage ... history , current culture ( though pretty much limited american culture ) , politics , philosophy , science , film , music , theology , course , books ! reviews gotten me read quite few books i otherwise would not found . i also read first things not agree its coverage or authorship broader , but any case don't limit yourself one or other -- take look both . you course access both through their web sites see what kinds articles included their issues .	1

it seems almost sacriligeous find fault tls which many kind book-review bible . but when compared other book- review venues including ny times bookreview ny review books , i find it somehow chauvinistically british narrowly focused . i also must admit not liking skimpy look journal . i base my remarks here not one reading one journal but my general feeling after going through many many different editions tls over many years . now i should qualify this saying there course many many outstanding reviews outstanding books , outstanding round- up surveys special feature reviews . however when it comes areas which i degree specialization , i usually find taste reviewer so wide mine i end reading unease dissatisfaction .	-1

i subscribed ws couple years late 90s , loved magazine . it keeps balance reviews wines both new ( which main emphasis ) older vintages , background stories vintners so . writers almost all very good ( i'm professional writer myself ) -- only one them i dislike he doesn't review wines . both wine connoisseur novice profit reading this publication . i only dropped subscription because i moved collection , no issue which i wished discard , occupying more more space my bookshelves . now i subscribe online edition so i check ratings before i buy wine . ws , addition parker other reviewers , perform essential service critical consumers who can't otherwise judge whether bottle worth price asked . we need ws parker all tell us when best reds ready drink -- some really great ones not mature more than decade . i drank highly rated chateau canon 1982 , which i'd paid over $100 , 17 years after harvest , my group could tell it wasn't ready -- still closed down . sure enough , if i read spectator carefully , i'd picked bottle occasion because they said it wasn't yet mature . robert parker reputation more influential high-end wines , but wine spectator scores generally pretty close his . they review broader spectrum , noted other commentators below . ws often steer you excellent buys under $15 , or even under $10 . if you get only one these per month , or steers you away very overpriced bottle , subscription ( $50 ) pays itself	1

i always avoided parenting magazines : their crowded covers life-or-death information , flash-in-the-pan expert pontificating ( pacifiers dangerous ! not using pacifiers dangerous ! ) , buzz-word-loaded headlines , frantic exclamation points , they unappealing me local evening news . inside those magazines just scattered hectic their covers , nanny , articles themselves , primarily life parent like getting your spouse help out , sex after kids , how get your groove back/feel hip , what toys buy your children next , etc , not really my niche anyway . i subscription martha stewart kids little while , because i liked project ideas ( though i always adapted them make them much less involved ) , but focus magazine become large , elaborate , professionally catered birthday parties , so i dropped i t.t hen , i came across wondertime . while other parenting magazines remind me parents swapping opinions , advice , gripes other parents , this more like what child would tell you if he could : example , what makes playroom truly functional child -an article which begins mother realizing her formal dining room waste space which i wish i could give every family i've ever worked . article " come play me " summer 2006 issue begins " grown-up mean you've outgrown child play ? c'mon , you know you it you . here some playful ideas outing your inner child . " it actually perspective how enjoy it -not tips how cope fact you find it mind-numbingly boring or must endure it necessary " quality time . " article " broom one own " talks how much children love included , helping , doing something themselves . toys mentioned here things like mirrors , sand , water , great outdoors ( sense advertisements here seem really out place ) . i also deeply appreciate magazine attitude towards children learning . other magazines , there abundance advice how ensure you stimulating your children much possible , how manipulate their play exploration , how make everything into language game , everything into quiz , everything into kind lesson which adult charge show puts child through his paces . this magazine , least now , takes approach learning happens . allow it happen allow yourself enjoy around it . i love . i can't wait see third issue	1

i personally always enjoyed reading time magazine long before i became politically aware . i started reading this magazine since i my adolescence . i think it liberal biased some other reviewers claims it ? i don't know i don't care . i don't read it particular point view . some cover stories past may highly questionable given how shallow they might but i don't take it personally . one best articles i read long time issue high school drop outs . i thought quite thought provoking . i didn't think much 100 most influential people world list . katie couric ?! c'mon . woman hard journalism paris hilton music . i won't even get into rachel ray . if people think time magazine too liberal , then go read national review . i don't see time hard journalism . half stuff they publish fluff pieces .	-1

your grandfather told you , you can't always judge book its cover . nor , these days , title magazine always clue you into content begins page three . refreshing , then , page through issue car driver find -- still crazy after all these years--it * still * cars drivers . don't get me wrong ; usual suspects appear month after month columns dig into one aspect or auto industry . there those ubiquitous pages adds major auto producers after-market confectioners shiny things bolt onto them . but everything else cars people who drive them . slightly more accurate : cars , written people who drive them . fair number pages given over exotic performo varieties four-wheeled fast . but car driver displays no embarrassment majoring cars rest drive . or might drive or might choose never drive , given due attention reviews put into hands drivers like this reviewer drivers who drive living .

atlantic classic cultural , political literary voice america . first published team included legendary icons such ralph waldo emerson , oliver wendell holmes henry wadsworth longfellow , this periodical went include articles great historical figures such mark twain , woodrow wilson martin luther king jr. it may hard place current contributors next those specific individuals who came before them , but they stand tall contemparies published similar venues . this not magazine those who currently feel they well enough informed current crop " news-tainment " programs , talking heads mouthpieces found air waves today . here you'll find in-depth , critical analysis intelligent literature . you disagree some points view might you feel compelled label something it pages conservative or liberal ? maybe , but it understandable today climate . i would suggest you'd probably trying too hard , perhaps unconsciously , fit authors articles into particular partisan column . letters editor tend highlight differing points view so i encourage you read back following month see how others respond get feel magazine . i think most reasonable people tend find this magazine well worth time read regularly . recently there usually one full length article related issue middle east each month , which should expected current events , but content varies significantly within each issue you won't feel overwhelmed . there regular sections columns ranging travel book reviews fiction " post mortem " profiling some notable world figure who recently passed away . way comparison , harper new yorker probably closest style , though new yorker comes out weekly ( mostly ) instead monthly ( mostly ) like atlantic harper . if you're trying decide three , pick up each them two or three months see which you like best . i prefer atlantic overall , but if i time , i may pick up one or other if some particular topic it particularly interest me . bottom line , you could lot worse than subscribe atlantic	1

there not many magazines specializing political commentary really any good these days . so many them geared toward political party , instead concentrating issues most important . " reason " magazine exception , its motto " free mind implies free market " vice versa , it proven publication one count objective analysis under umbrella motto . authors who write it definitely their biases , but they attentive these biases , usually anticipate answer objections ideas which they expound . many times this reviewer heard authors editors reason " socially liberal " but " fiscally conservative . " this kind description almost implies their thinking mere hybrid liberalism conservatism . but this description incorrect , content articles reason consequence general belief among its authors editors freedom , means first freedom mind , moral universal , regardless place context which one finds oneself . `social liberalism ' reason , if one call it , manifests itself tolerance ideas one finds repugnant . `fiscal conservatism ' reason manifests itself belief freedom not subject arbitrary coercive government no qualms using deception or actual force collect taxes , impose censorship , or generally violate individual rights . there always many fine articles written reason diversity topics . advocacy biotechnology refreshing reflects common sense attitude very rare political debate this branch technology . one also find commentary government waste , propaganda , torture , " war " drugs . addition , many book reviews included books relevant issues magazine wants address . one only hope reason stays afloat delivers many more insights years come . magazine both barometer freedom thought well its creation .	1

i through years read many different pieces tnr . they almost always high quality , credible convincing . there exceptions . they not so long back published piece tony judt israel which i found ill- informed outrageous . general however they through years fairly understanding special dilmenas israel faces . editor martin peretz strong israel supporter although he takes quite dovish shimon pereslike line . book- reviews tnr outstanding , recent example robert alter amos oz masterpiece-memoir " tale love darkness .

after buying first issue rachael ray new magazine i knew i would subscribe after only few pages . those pages not only gorgeous glossy , but chock full fun facts , great shopping places food utensils , course tasty recipes you want make . i collected way too many cookbooks food magazines stand untouched because when it really boils down it , its all food some those books magazines not deliver end . i since bought some great cookbooks pay more attention what inside then what cover . rachael recipes not pretentious , they certainly interesting enough engage reader into trying them out . i've made several dishes lemon cream pasta , mushroom pizza , salmon pasta dishes , sangria frozen pops some great grilled food . rachel provides shopping lists standard pantry ingredients fresh produce buy , so its easy see what you all ready what few things i pick up my way home make fun meal . i love making her recipes adding them my repertoire , its nice knowing you make certain dish its even nicer whip up easy dinner or lunch using this magazine . i also adore fun articles you find restaurants , cheese diaries , wine tasting , outdoor grilling foods events . magazine really beauty read more information entertainment than advertising . i cant stand regular food magazine i used get half full cat litter advertising , page after page useless products screaming my face . i hope this magazine continue bloom because i absolutely adore it i intend keeping every issue instead tearing out recipes like i used . great buy something you cook out feeling mini cookbook but simpler prettier	1

if i pick just one women magazine subscribe , " good housekeeping " would one . it many same articles all women magazines : articles health , fitness , finance , relationships , diet , beauty , fashion . but " good housekeeping " goes beyond surface these articles , example , their fashion articles don't focus just high-priced clothing , instead they show outfits look like their expensive counterparts readers buy just fraction cost . there also advice columnists things like household hints , etiquette , relationships . each issue also short story . there also seemingly obligatory celebrity cover interview inside each issue . what i like " good housekeeping " in-depth articles . most magazines today publish articles only page or so long , but many articles " good housekeeping " several pages long . articles often ordinary people making difference world . there usually cautionary articles parents young children and/or teenagers frightening ( recent article sexually abusive male babysitter ) but very useful . many magazines , good housekeeping also on-line counterpart , where readers post messages current issues well enter contests . well worth subscribing .	1

saveur guilty pleasure me some time . guilty because it hard take serious magazine such hoity sounding name ... admittedly some travel-and-food stories just edge self-indulgent , self-concious behaviour . they laugh me home ( or used ) reading it . what makes it good content . cover story each issue usually " destination " article , focused particular area its food ( cuisine wrong word here ) , written personal vein , beautiful photos , this heart magazine . but other content equally beautiful it amazing how many recipes actually useful become mainstays me ... not just something good looking . hide cover if you must , but i think this best " foodie " magazine	-1

... if it heterosexuals . playboy multidimensional lively magazine men . it addresses all areas male life including technology , work , hobbies , sports . yes , sex included , both word pictorial , but , clearly , playboy not smut . there nothing dirty it . nude women appear small number its pages contents , they far most innocently portrayed than you'll find just anywhere else internet . nowadays , culture bar set so low idea nude women , appearing alone frame , regarded pornography seems rather quaint . honestly , there no exploitation found any their exposes . girls immediate justification evolutionary psychology they mature but height physical fertility . they hypnotic view . articles , which admittedly clichd excuse reading playboy , , fact , extremely underrated . many them focused educational . only reason i don't give it five stars due fact i am not member democratic party , i feel playboy ideological agenda it expresses far too often . this past issue slanted interview democratic advisor article arthur schlesinger which highly biased . i really think this inappropriate because lifestyle magazine should not shove politics down one throat . furthermore , such ideological vantage point absurd given editors ' real enemies not " theocrats , " but male-hating bully boys political correctness . none these shrill social critics found right . they spread misandry perches media womyn studies programs terrorize our universities . publication like this , any engagement or importance , must recognize , battle , ridicule political correctness wherever it found .	-1

i'll agree everyone else say this magazine probably need new name . however , i love all other features magazine ! it cooking light , but there so much more - always article travel destination , article beauty , article sport , well other constants . theme magazine total healthy living , incorporating health issues exercise well healthy food , though i think it mostly food magazine . i gave it four stars because while recipies look good , some ingredients bit too sophisticated everyday too expensive .	-1

" fortune " generally caters people managerial bent , especially upper-level executives , but also offers excellent analysis current events business world , global national economic climate , forward-looking technology trend information . each issue normally organized around theme or major story , like enron trial , or 100 best companies work given year . i enjoy articles where they rank things , but more than rankings themselves , i am always interested justifications they use their rankings ; while i don't always agree magazine , i always find it good food though t.t he features generally very polished accurate , lessons conveyed straightforward manner useful ceo college business student . i particularly appreciate interviews " fortune " key players financial industry , also appreciate very useful index companies individuals featured every issue . magazine probably not favorite investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain ; small investors may also want read more specific magazine like " kiplinger .

self-diagnosed christianity today junkie , i cannot speak highly enough christianity today thoughtful comprehensive resource anyone interested christian faith . ct brainchild billy graham fifty years ago , it maintains his strain christian perspective , namely evangelicalism . graham never interested preacher answering every bit theological doctrinal minutiae , nor christianity today aim so . instead , this magazine truly covers full spectrum issues impact lives christians , news stories current events biographies leaders within church analyses important social spiritual matters controversial battles ( past present ) . ct offers genuinely global perspective christianity , telling missionary stories around world each issue . there stories successful thriving churches every stripe descriptions victories successes occur within all sorts denominations ecclesiastical organizations . they periodically include debates or discussions opposing sides important theological ideas , offering folks both sides forum state their case . one things i appreciate most christianity today their passion journalism right way christians . they publish articles writers whom many their readers not necessarily agree , they chronicle lives many folks who may outside church or least affiliated fringe movement . they all this while maintaining unabashedly clear evangelical center , which most clearly communicated through editorials each issue . i love heart this magazine its leadership . i love their approach their charge evangelical christian journalists . i truly read each issue , cover cover , including all advertisements even classified ads ! i feel like i remain well-educated informed christian when i immerse myself this amazing resource . i find myself copying or forwarding links least one or two articles each issue friends family whose lives i know touched mine always when i invest reading pages christianity today . i would recommend it anyone .	1

i guess i still subscribe pictures . ;-) yes , there time when scientific american so difficult read understand i always felt like idiot , even when i award-winning physics major college ( yeah , hard believe ! ) . now it great way keep up cutting-edge scientific thought . i still don't entirely grasp latest string theories or loop quantum gravity , but i read those articles -- admittedly help graphics -- get idea implications theories , how they work or conflict other theories . most hard-core articles still written research scientists , but these authors become better writers , they learned audience like me : general population , wanting keep up latest cool stuff . there still purely scientific periodicals where they publish their equations use latest jargon . i'm thankful they " dumb it down " rest us . time when good science often dismissed general public favor " what bleep ... " other popularized pseudo-science , i am incredibly thankful scientific american still true scientific method .	1
i read scientific american occassionally back 80 . time i found articles ( especially physics articles , which i love ) especially dense poorly supported graphics . quality there but it didn't quite get across my younger self . now , i find text very good superbly well-supported side matter graphics . i would call this improvement ( both magazine , perhaps , myself ) . however , i didn't read it regularly back then , so perhaps negative reviewers correct saying magazine " dumbed down " . if so , then it very lofty level articles continue require reasonable background their subject areas . example , article " computing quantum knots " just right somebody who read number non-mathematical treatments this topic who , like me , read parts feynman lectures things nature . it sophisticated intelligent article . there many more examples i could give . my only gripe scientific american ( this true decades ) i just don't like medical articles magazine regulary them . this , however , personal matter reflects my interests not quality magazine . i strongly suspect " format changed " , some said , because publisher wanted improve it everybody catch few more readers . certainly , i would not subscribed old scientific american . it too dense too boring . now it just right me . but that me . your mileage may vary	1

regular readers my reviews probably getting sick me mentioning kage baker , but i credit her getting me try lot things i wouldn't normally try if she hadn't part them . asimov science fiction magazine time where this case . while i bought fantasy science fiction magazine every month while now , i would also check asimov see if it baker story . if it , i would buy it . what i found , however , i enjoyed most other stories issues i bought well . thus , now i buying it every month too . much like fantasy science fiction , asimov contains mostly science fiction stories various lengths ( short story , novelette , novella ) couple columns some cartoons . difference two asimov contains no fantasy ( though some mike resnick stories fantasy feel them ) . however , magazine likes concentrate character-based science fiction , so you won't see lot " technology first , character second " stories magazine . personally , i think that good thing hard science fiction turns me off . if you're more into hard sciences , you may find stuff here interest you , but there good chance you won't . occasionally , there guest editorials ( they printed george r.r. martin guest honor speech worldcon october/november issue ) . there always " books " column , sometimes written paul di filippo , sometimes peter heck . authors use this column recommend books you may not come across . robert silverberg opens each issue " reflections " column cover everything space exploration ideas story-writing . james patrick kelly occasionally featured " net " column , examining various science fiction web sites other online activities . unlike fantasy science fiction , there often some poetry included well . finally , there calendar upcoming conventions covers world so you always find someplace go if you need get together group fans . bread butter magazine , though , stories . each story introduction editor ( currently gardner dozois , though change sheila williams january issue ) , which may explain genesis story , or just tell us how long it since author appeared asimov . one things asimov different it often serializes stories eventually appear book form . allen . steele coyote series serialized over last couple years all them collected two books ( coyote couple years ago , upcoming coyote rising ) . also , charles stross ' accelerando featured recent issues . one drawback this readers who only pick up occasional issue . instance , " survivor " october/november issue didn't really mean lot because i've missed everything came before it . it reward regular readers , though . asimov many writers who write almost exclusively magazine , or very least authors submit their stories this magazine first refusal . my favourite , kage baker , only seems appear here , only one story i know appearing realms fantasy . allen . steele . robert reed seems featured everywhere ( i swear guy churning them out like he machine ) but he featured lot asimov . magazine bound just like fantasy science fiction , however cover thin paper rather than thicker stock , so it tear bit easier . this advantage you sometimes leave it lying open reading ( though this only works if you're toward middle it ) . it also means it rolled up if necessary . only other fault i it , this strictly personal thing , stories don't always grab me much they fantasy science fiction . this mainly because i'm more into fantasy than science fiction , so this certainly wouldn't case everyone . while hit miss ratio varies issue issue , i say i never skipped story magazine . again , that benefit short fiction . you're not going waste lot time them . if i choose two magazines , i would definitely choose fantasy science fiction . however , asimov certainly good enough it easy make room both them . plus , picking them both up , i feel like i'm doing my part keeping short fiction alive . it only small part , but every little bit helps . david ro	1
i love elle magazine ! it better than vogue , my opinion , because vogue all too expensive clothes only rich people afford , too many damn pages it basically picture book more than anything . it filled nothing but advertisements pictures anorexic models . i get bored reading/looking it fast . elle other hand , articles informative more affordable designer clothes shown . beauty fashion featured , but so some great reading material .	1

i've subscriber over fifteen years , probably continue subscribe until day i die . but times i find national geographic frustrating . i no interest soccer , nor i want huge fold-out map discussing sport . aren't there more phenomenal things going world today ? also , geographic its pet topics . how many articles must we read pandas ? dozen ? i like pandas , believe me , but surely there other less cute animals discuss . also i could without lectures pc environmental propaganda . articles oil-drilling alaska filled thinly veiled agenda which preachy annoying . yeah , we get it , you don't want alaska drilled . we move , please ? other articles quite interesting . i enjoy zip code discussion , old-fashioned pictures , articles countries . i could fewer articles underwater archaeology though , articles filled preachy environmentalist scolding gets boring . friend mine ( joe average type guy ) , said he stopped subscribing geographic because articles depressing him . i tried argue him , because i think magazine great- but i kind agree , topics late downbeat aren't particularly uplifting . i believe magazine getting little ' out there ' its choice topics , too . i recommend this magazine those interested environment world around them	-1

i would love subscribe olive , but i can't justify it . i understand subscription includes airmail , but still ! i buy single issues store near my home , even retail prices , 12 issues cost less than subscription . but , give you idea how good magazine this , every single month i deliberately make trek store buy copy . if you looking marketing description , olive would seem like real simple , or magazine its ilk , but somehow i find it more satisfying than those perfectly nice publications i never find anything makes me say , " let make this weekend . " i'm not sure how describe reasons why . olive could subtitled " food , wine , travel busy people , " because it emphasizes tasty meals without fuss . each issue section 5-10 dinners you get table 30 minutes ; plus " weekend cooking " section dishes you're willing fiddle ; plus section cooking what fresh market right now . ( issue i picked up today three recipes feature peas , instance . ) it ranges exotic thai curries fish chips . there also restaurant reviews travel ( more " travel foodies " -- they expend some energy telling you where eat ) . i cooked least one dish nearly every issue , every single one them winner . these aren't necessarily " company cooking , " though some recipes certainly qualify . however , their " fast food " section exactly what i want : real meal that feasible middle week . among my favorites chicken-mushroom-wine stew pastry . it really take half hour , start finish , part because it instructs you use store-bought puff pastry . man , it tasty . would enough ... but fun extra this british magazine , put out bbc . when they taste-tests tea or chocolate or ketchup , brands what available uk . although i recognize few brands , results aren't terribly useful ; but i think it hoot . ( what i say ? my idea cool thing vacation foreign country go grocery shopping . ) nor most restaurant reviews likely relevant ; but then , ny times restaurant review isn't going help me , either . i still enjoy it . i can't imagine you'll spend this kind money without seeing issue . if you've seen copy wondered if its quality holds up ... i assure you , it . only food magazine i think equal quality u.s. fine cooking , it different angle	1

" that great if you're west coast , since you'll get some california hikes if you live there , some washington hikes if you live there . but midwest stretches michigan texas . here indiana , i'd rather get appalachian trails ( or southern trails alabama mississippi ) than trails texas or oklahoma . could we " great lakes " region , maybe ? also , magazine heavily dependent equipment advertising that obvious editorial content . magazine philosophy unreconstructed gearhead who loves spending money stuff . i know that how magazine business works , but i don't like i t.t hose complaints aside , it best backpacking magazine out there , well worth price subscription	-1

this quarterly magazine really hits spot , if you're its crosshairs . it clean miss others . it pretty easy tell whether you're target audience . you closet full decommisioned pcs , cell phones , other 21st-century rubble you just know you could " something " ? you dremel tool , fine-tipped soldering iron , more than one kind epoxy house ? phrases " it works " " it beautiful " mean roughly same thing you ? idea home cnc milling machine stir you jealousy or quick look your checkbook ? two or more yes answers probably qualify you intended reader . this hacking your pc mouse or cage your pet mouse , resurrecting last year laptop electronic photo frame , how simple robot control ( you'd surprised ) . it like popular mechanics , but people who consider software , resistors , pieces antique clocks interchangeable . although few ideas each issue low-tech appeal , most aimed skill sets " geeky highschooler " " electronics professional " . this magazine comes o'reilly , publisher who fills bookshelves dilbertian cube farms everywhere . some ways , this looks like self-concious attempt community-building , creating forum home robot-builders artisans silicon age . well , maybe that not bad thing - communities out there , but not easy beginner find or break into . it also helps minimal advertising ( part reason hefty cover price ) well targeted electronic gadgeteering hobbyist . title only up issue number 6 this writing , so i'm not sure it wholly found itself yet . example , i would preferred schematic some circuits addition assembly instructions . still , scriptwriter macgyver , there lot like here - right reader . //wiredweir	-1

i discovered uk magazine , blackhair my local library . i devoured latest three issues . black woman , blackhair beauty magazine i've longing . each issue divided into three sections -- beauty , fashion , hair . there plenty stories how care all types black complexioins skin , well hair weaves braids relaxers natural styles . most united states black hair magazines seem forget natural styles or attach story seems tacked end . blackhair also offers glossary chemicals ingredients featured most beauty hair products . this gives women chance figure out if they're using right products based their needs . there also plenty advice columns answers readers ' questions . i really love fact they use real-looking models dark-skinned models norm , not afterthought . if subscription wasn't $74 us , i would certainly plunk down money one . i love blackhair magazine i hope my library keeps carrying it	1
friend mine told me " fast company " year ago , i subscriber avid reader since then . magazine enigmatic , combining news magazine , cultural commentary , business reporting , entrepreneurial insights into one publication . many issues deserve five star rating , but occasionally cohesion editorial focus bit uneven . thing i most like " fast company " 21st century approach news analysis : it thought provoking , explores all sides complex issues , but never tries tell reader what think . perfect example this april , 2006 issue article " al jazeera ( global ) mission , " which former us marine now working english-language version al jazeera profiled extremely multi-faceted story . entrepreneurial bent magazine great younger managers small business professionals , reporting market trends second none . although there times i don't agree articles or editorials " fast company , " i always find them intellectually stimulating thought provoking . i recommend this magazine independent thinkers everywhere	-1

elle decor ( usa ) doesn't appeal me since i started reading british version , elle decoration ( uk ) . elle decor ( usa ) reads like showroom catalog filled spaces average american never live , nor could one ever reproduce even small scale their own homes since most magazine 50% design 50% architecture me - meaning often design room would look silly like complete rubbish , but it bones room - soaring ceilings , towering columns , sweeping staircase , make rooms appealing . unfortunately , very few us own homes like , so when we try apply same ' look ' our own spaces , we fall flat . elle decoration ( uk ) , other hand , takes much more creative approach design , although shot beautiful rooms , they often not feature all architectural details massive spaces elle decor ( usa ) features , so you apply designs your tiny nyc apartment come up look works your space . their designs not so stiff formal , they not take design , nor themselves , too seriously . elle decor ( usa ) seems flaunt overindulgence over-the-top , where everything must follow specific guidelines there no room jump outside lines every now then . elle decoration ( uk ) jumps out lines constantly , showing us good design isn't taking things so seriously home lacks warmth personalization . it may seem though i'm bashing elle decor ( usa ) , i'm not , i read it well . it offers informative articles beautiful homes , eye candy we all dream . but elle decoration ( uk ) blows idea perfect living dream home out water approachable design one could duplicate their own home - whether it urban apartment heart queens , or architectural masterpiece midwest . this magazine appeals all , making it one my top 5 magazines out there	1

if you're here u.s. , don't let put you off reading this fantastic magazine just because you won't see lot american cars . this magazine worth every cent ( more later ) . reading miriad great cars , cheap thrills supercars , you can't get here bring tears your eyes . renault making giant killer little chevy aveo-sized hatchback 197 horsepower 18-inch wheels ? yes , it happens over there . it simply so much more than you see any u.s. car mag . it big , both physically content , written kind thorough evaluation engrossing , you'd-swear-you-were-right-there-with-them prose above any other ( including car , my pervious favorite ) . what makes it so good ? three main things . first , writers , course , many them springing former performance car magazine . sad publication declined just every way over it lifetime until , time it demise , it wasn't worth bother anymore . oh , how they've redeamed themselves ! second , cars they write . focus performance ; but not just super-exotics , thank god , tuner cars ( although latter pop up now then entirely appropriate way ) , but anything stirs driver soul , even if it $ 10,000 little hatch zingy engine giddy handling . third , writing . evo much more biased toward subjective evaluation favor just spouting instrument test numbers ( hello u.s. car magazines pages pages minute often uninteresting stats ) , their data panels concise just enough information thorough without bunch fluff ( brake swept area ? come , road track , who cares ? ) . best example far their annual car year issue . yes , everyone these , but no one it like evo . it much more free-form , much more subjective , much , much more fun read . rather than evaluate each car distinct portion , it reads more like road adventure drivers swapping cars really letting you know how each drive . frankly , you get impression evo doesn't give squat if one car pulls . 89g skidpad while competitor pulls . 87g . what you're much more likely read how each car * feels * when grip used , used limit . hard numbers matter less than true driving fun , which why you might find handling little hatchback rated above wide tired monster . they provide plenty performance data , but big difference they don't get caught up it . you'll find it more important how car handles than how it grips , how effective it brakes over long , hard drive rather than how many feet it takes single stop , how car works or against you provide real fun . all engaging writing wit . i'll stop babbling now . :o ) but i want conclude one item mentioned almost every review here - price . it cheaper buy good bookstore . there some convenience peace mind subscription , but i'm baffled why british car mags always more expensive subscribe than buy off shelf . evo still worth it , though	1
