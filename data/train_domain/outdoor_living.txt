this seems like great idea - food held basket , so you don't shove skewer through meat . however , little bolts hold down clamp onto rack meant tightened hand . if you sizable chicken , you cannot tighten these enough hand . i chicken fall out rack into flames more than once . then you tighten them pliers , but metal so soft you only this 2 or 3 times , then threads stripped whole thing useless ! again : hand tighten = chicken falls out ; tighten pliers = threads stripped . now i try get replacement parts rotisserie weber . good luck	-1

i am extreamly disappointed this product . icons not give indication type weather you expect . instead , they provide indication if weather getting worse or better . fluff out side box states : " forecast icon based changing barometric pressure .

i owned wmr-968 several years now spent more ' replacement ' parts than if i bought entire new unit . primarily , solar transmitter rain gauge continually fails bring charge up enough power transmitter transmit back base . i replaced this transmitter unit three times ( twice ' new ' style ) . living phoenix area , we don't run into too many cloudy or rainy days , but soon it doesn't get sunlight any length time , display reads all dashes ( not receiving signal ) . so when it rains here , i usually don't get reading how much because this thing stops working . anemometer mounted same pole just above rain gauge both solar transmitters also mounted same pole . anemometer works consistently fine . both os local distributor say distance too far , unit must gone bad needs replacement , etc ., etc . replacing solar unit didn't help distance can't too far one unit not other . no one help this issue . so my suggestion would spend extra bucks get something more reliable .	-1

purchased 2 these my office am buying 2 more home . these easy set up , easy read , self adjusting daylight savings time " atomic " function ( self setting ) wonderful . earlier reviewer mentioned how reset when battery needs replacement which i found very helpful , so keep set up instructions handy refer if when you need replace batteries ! also purchased 2 larger 14 inch version they're just nice	1
considering i purchased this item my bedroom , i would say it perfect . aesthetic reasons i preferred analog wall clock , but thought hearing second hand tick all night not option until i found this item lacrosse . it could not anymore perfect , its looks , price , self ( time ) adjusting qualities made this . " m.f. " ( major find ) . now i sleep through daylight savings time adjustments not worry actual adjustment my clock , but whether or not i hour early , or late work	1
note : amazon description not include dimensions . package it recommends you measure first . it fits smokers 30 " ( 76cm ) across ( perhaps including handles , not sure ) 36 " ( 91cm)vertically . it bit big my standard-sized smoker ( 20 " across ) , so it unflattering its graceful curves , but good enough useful . it cheaply made , but looks like it suitable . i update my report if it falls apart use ( like reviewer said ) . it quite possible garbage bag would enough protect your grill . main advantage here it fits bit better , elastic close bottom bit . it probably looks bit better , if you care	-1
this good rack ; it cleaned pretty easily nice compact size but ribs just bit too close together ( i cook mainly full spare ribs ) . i rib racks steven raichlen perfect . more spacious racks allow better basting , heat distribution more even cooking . when meat touches like weber rack , meat doesn't cook well	-1
i bought this clock my pool deck it works great - it set itself within 10 minutes putting battery . i it wall overhang 4 feet , so it protected weather . you see it well across yard . several comments visitors - they think its great outdoor clock . thermometer not automatically set , you need set it . it seems work fine , i checked it couple times local temperature radio/tv . would recommend clock those looking outdoor time piece	1
i use table top grill 65 days year . only one i depend weber . only reason i replace it when mine get stolen	1
week ago i got this gas go-anywhere , i not sure if it right one or not cuz some negative reviews , so before i opened box i desided return it back , but i said my self why dont we give it chance , so i opened it i used it 2 steak rib-eyes ... ohh my god it immazing , ok .. it exactly like big gas bbq gril but smaller , so it very smart wat hold ,... meat not burned up it like tender , so if u small family u dont enough room big one get this one ... it good job steak so i think it'll great anything else ... i'll try chicken today ...	1
bought this umbrella last week ( 9/23/05 ) amazon . initially hesitant purchasing it due other reviews describing issue pole two pieces , which , when connected , never straight . all i want add here i not experience this problem . screw mechanism which joins poles seems sturdy , pole appears perfectly straight . i wonder if other people bought umbrellas bad batch or manufacturer redesigned connection mechanism ? ( most recent reviews not mention this problem)re . overall quality , i can't speak how pole or umbrella itself wear over time , but least initially it looks good quality sturdy construction . one thing note despite product description picture making it look like pole made wood , it appears actually made some sort metal which wood coloured ( it still looks like wood though would not look out place wooden patio furniture ) . honest i actually prefer this , since i would imagine it won't discolour easily natural wood should longer lasting . summary , am very pleased my purchase - i would happily recommend it others looking good quality umbrella very reasonable price	1
it funny how guys coming bbq all comment check out this grill	1
i owned only 2 grills my lifetime . both little , cheap unsuited my novice grilling status . when i committed buy real barbeque grill i read scores reviews descriptions find right one . after reading amazon customer reviews performer ( 827020 22.5 inch performer charcoal grill propane gas ingnition , purchased summer 2003 ) i so impressed i bought it . what grill ! i don't know how weber it ( convection , perhaps ? ) -- even my overdone meats come out moist flavorful . veggies come out great -- i grilled zucchini squash last summer , yumm ! this grill gives me best both worlds : gas charcoal . gas feature allows me light up quickly , rain or shine . small propane tank not primary energy source , so seldom needs refilling . charcoal gives foods real barbeque flavor , my gardens love weber convenient one step ash disposal system . i cannot praise this grill enough . i only wish newer version inspired more positive reviews , hope friends i recommended performer still find this model	1
this grill 8 or 9 years .... unbelievable great product . 2nd house miss . river ... used almost year round , atleast twice week ... never problem .. highly recommend if like charcoal opposed gas ..	1
america test kitchen rated it number one , so i decided try one myself . i owned grill brushes home depot , online catalog sellers , etceteras . bristles , regardless material , these brushes end up shedding over time , or if not they crush down become nearly worthless . grill wizard eliminates these problems using replaceable pad . pad works great . i'm still my first pad used it probably 10 times or more already . it good product i highly recommend it	1
this product works very well , it also good range . mine 20ft away my recieve it works fine through walls	1
i bought this unit 4 years ago . it performed flawlessly . i'm still amazed how often rain prediction turns out correct . it hitting 90% accuracy rain within 36 hours . better than weather dude television	1
i one these when they first came out loved it . this one even better . i would say it must someone trouble getting steak medium rare . since purchasing this item , i once again perfect steak . i am so glad i found this fork again . i am one happy person	1
great product , durable quality stitching . worth its price protect your grill	1
just got this mail my char-broil grill , so this point i cant speak how it hold up over time . nonetheless , this appears exceptionally sturdy well-made product . nice , thick , heavy , two layers - canvas like exterior black lining . price , i cant imagine there better grill cover market . one caveat i would offer one many reviewers noted , color not pictured . amazon photo shows almost teal green white middle section . photos product box call color ' mountain green ' show forest green type color , cream colored middle . mine , however , dark olive color , one could easily called brown ad green , middle section cool , cement-y grey , not warm white all . it looks nice , great cover great price . but if youre ordering this match your patio furniture ( i certainly wasn't!) then this something aware . only other warning i would offer make sure it fits your grill . its big cover , not very adjustable . fits my char-broil grill perfectly , but it would look ridiculous smaller grill . only features i would wish here loop or hook outside cover , so i could hang it up when grilling , instead just draping it somewhere , drawstring some sort bottom , hold it closed . still , it so heavy well made , im certainly not complaining .	-1
we received this christmas gift come dependon it daily time weather . it displays accurate time , temperature weather " tendency " using rising or fallingpressure . it not display actual pressure numbers , only indicating rising or falling pressure . outside temp . pressure info transmitted wirelessly small unit mounted outside range 200 feet . quality unit good i would recommend anyone wanting accurate time standard which all clocks watches could set	1
i've owned this smoker 6 years great success turning out turkeys , pulled pork , ribs , etc . couple tips took me some time work out . 1 ) cover water pan some heavy duty foil after filling it . this'll prevent liquid boiling away too quickly . you won't refill it during smoking , it'll prevent smoker getting too " wet " inside . when i left it uncovered , i getting steamed meat , not smoked . 2 ) drill hole bottom unit , get drip pan underneath it . this'll allow any condensation drip out rather than collecting bottom smoker promoting rust . 3 ) get some heavy duty foil beneath heater element . makes cleanup much easier , gets heat reflected up food . fun ...	1
this unit well-built , last , easy use . assembly breeze . we it almost two years it performs superbly all types cooking -- it heats up quickly ( gets hot ! ) , yet flames turned way down never blow out . we use it several times week propane canister lasts three four weeks . course , if you turn all its mighty burners leave ' em way , it'll eat lot propane . but kind usage would quickly cremate anything you might cooking . i suspect people who complain propane consumption this barbecue cooking hood up , contrary weber instructions ( common sense ) . , let face it , any barbecue six mighty burners like these use its share propane . pluses : thick , solid stainless steel bars sear beautifully last forever . you want solid bars ! thermal inertia key good grilling . stainless means no rusty taste , no chipping , easy clean . fine flame control . six burners let you configure heat way you want . rotisserie smoker box thier own burners ! side burner works well too cooking veggies stuff pot . powerful yet capable gentle cooking . won't rust . built like tank . no cheap chinese componentry often found even formerly premium brands , all " house brands " , most which made entirely china , even big stainless-steel extravaganzas sell thousands . don't fooled fancy knobs gewgaws -- quality just not there deep inside far too many barbecues today . i've personally witnessed two big top-of-the-line house brand barbecues returned leading warehouse retailer irate purchasers who couldn't believe they'd crap out after year . never happens weber . convenient fold-down work surfaces . easy clean . huge cooking area . anti-flare burner configuration works well . lights instantly . easy wheel around yard -- something i wanted able , which built-in wouldn't allow . fantastic weber service . mine manhandled shipping company ; weber handled my complaint shipping company me ( i didn't anything all ) sent me new panel without any hassle all . their 24-hour support hotline best i've used anywhere any product , emails handled same-day . negatives : expensive ( but worth it ) . i'd buy it again heartbeat . it my first weber after years thinking they only popular because they're stylish . now i get it .	1

i just bought new genesis after owning my last one 11 years . excellent product . there plenty product info this page amazon manufacturer , so let me tell you few things i make my weber work best me . -most importantly ... keep it covered . amazon sells cover ... get it . not coving it cut its life half least . -cover funnel shaped grease drip pan tin foil change it regularly ; otherwise build-up trap catch fire not make steak taste very good . -change disposable grease traps regularly ( otherwise they start stink ) . -get yourself quality wire brush use it before each use ... not after . build-up cooking grates after each use actually protects them elements . -before each use , after you wire brush grates , put some cooking oil some paper towels wipe grates down . -pre-heat grill high least 5 - 10 minutes ; it burns off anything left over cleaning makes cooking grates nice hot . -initiate cooking steaks , chops , any cuts meat ( even burgers ... no , not hot dogs ) just-over-medium heat 2 minutes each side flip before cooking your liking . this brief searing each side locks flavor your cut meat . -cook closed cover ; normal cuts meat shouldn't take more than total 10 minutes ( including searing ) . -let your meat sit up 5 minutes before slicing ( or biting into it ! ) . this locks juices ; if juices too hot when you slice ( or bite ) , they'll run right out your cut mea t.t here you go . hope helps . don't forget cover grill after it cools . bon appetit !	1
wonderful grill . everything we expected . shipping problem . showed up week late . sat home three different delivery dates before shipper finally showed up . grill slightly damaged - we elected keep it rather than start shipping hassles over again . not sure money we saved buying through amazon worth it	1

this very nice cover , it heavy-duty vented rear top . others say this cover fits tight- it , but i get it off myself . trick , since cover little stiff , you hold it one hand above grill , while you use your other hand guide it grill . then it slides down fits properly . it looks awesome- really sets my grill apart my neighbors ' " unkept " grills ! :)	1
my porch my backyard , there used tons annoying insects flying around , because we live very near pond we woods . ever since i got this terrific product , i bug free almost 3 months now ! i go back bar-b-ques again ! this most amazing product ever created	1

my 15 year old son put grill together while i work . grill very even heat distribution very good heating controls . i cooked steak high temperatures chicken low temperatures . all items come out great so far . stainless steel cooking surfaces internal parts appear like they last time . my last weber grill lasted 12 years . i expect this one well or better . my only disappointment this grill not come configured quick-connects like last grill . it uses standard screw type connection gas bottle	1

1st , i've read thousand reviews this my first , yeah , maybe last . i've it 3 months after month #1 it deserved 3 stars . after month 2 earned 4 stars .... now top rated . it chicken best . lid ( con ) doesn't fit tight rotisserie ring so fire burns hotter than i would like . so .... this what i : 1- skewer 2 chickens thru chest-back angle . then season dry garlic herb ( or lemon pepper ) . if you season first then most removed when skewered . seperate chickens onion or potato . don't tie . 2- center charcoal 6 " wide across center kettle side side . when fire 1/2 started put chickens above flame . fire burn fully because lid doesn't seal ( remember ? ) . flavor where flame meets chicken . no other way work .. 3- cook 45 minutes or til skin pulls away end chicken legs . looks burnt ? skin might but inside great . trust me . take it off grill let it rest 20 minutes . flame still going ?? skewer some red or white potatoes . tastes great sooo moist ! pack leftovers sealed plastic bag it keep week . ok , i am guessing part . mine only lasts few days .. con cost . it should included skewer length basket holding ribs , fish etc . so this end my review . i bought some junk ' net ..... but this one my better choices . jc , tamp	1

like several other reviewers , my smoker also came badly damaged . i bought this use going away party planned smoking 25 lbs . ribs . when it arrived i saw how badly damaged it , i immediately e-mailed amazon they shipped me replacement next day . my replacement also came damaged ( worst than original ) . it one day before party i no choice but use it even though it damaged . i must say ribs turned out great . i am very impressed this smoker it ease use but return them due amount damage both units . i believe this smoker well worth price would give it 5 stars if they would just package it better . i also give 5 stars amazon it great customer service .	-1

we original hatteras rope hammack which we purchased when we lived north carolina . i love it but rope tends stretch too much requires rehanging tighten it . we informed it would when we purchased it four years ago , but now it seems more work than it worth . solid quilted design seems like it would better would require less maintenance . also , our poodle-mix pet just loves it . she would try jump before we could even get it hanged . we attach cover it keep her paws going through ropes , so adds value solid design . thanks listening me we plan purchasing guilted hammack soon possible	1
i use my hammock 75% year find it extremely comfortable . it bit expensive but i guess long run it worth it . i mesh hammocks only last one season . i think this one going last years	1

i'm my second mr. bar-b-q wood brush long they keep selling it value price , i imagine i keep buying them . no , they don't last forever -- eventually bristles get clogged greasy sludge ( how long depends frequency use ) , but while it lasts , it fine job cleaning scraping your grill . what sets it apart long handle large head covered brass bristles . while those bristles could stand bit longer , they still longer than many . scraper side quite strong not bend or break easily . you get lot your money this solid product which could last several seasons	-1

this lounge/deck chair cushon worth every peny . it thick , comfortable ( none those deck chairs comfortable without substantial cushion ) , available several color choices , soft , not plasticky , cover fabric . you measure width your deck chair carefully see if it fit . it just barely fit my ' titanic ' deck chair because i scrunch it up bit near arms . but all turned out well i must say i am very happy it . it quality product keep you much more comfortable during your hours patio than those cheaper , but much thinner , types sold outlet stores or supermarkets summer . get best . this it	1

i gave one my nephew christmas he everyone else liked it so well everybody family tried it out i now order one his mother also one my husband . projection feature great projection display actually larger brighter than i thought it would . honest i mention drawback - display clock itself so small not backlit so you pretty close it see time during day . until someone puts projection feature larger size cd/alarm clock , we continue keep our old alarm clock put this one other side bed use it mainly projection feature . even drawback mentioned , we all love clock . my nephew loves able see what time it without putting his glasses	1
this griddle very useful , especially if you bring your grill camp site . surface cooks evenly if sufficiently heated good job . first i thought it solid cast iron but upon further inspection found it some kind high temperature coating . my only criticism it isn't more non-stick surface food hard clean off after use . gee whiz factor great when you whip it out around other people who little stamped metal travel grills . this item really rounds out baby q options .	-1
two days after buying this swing i found just exact thing i looking contacted don , seller , refund . even though it sunday , he got right back me said he'd make every effort cancel order , even though it ships direct his supplier . he kept me informed every step way while he what he could cancel . tuesday , i got word order cancelled full refund given . it such stress-free exchange . i would recommend this buyer sure	1
if you looking this very accurate , then you need use lithium batteries . because cold temps here , cheaper batteries not work well . maybe where it doesn't get minus temps , rayovac batteries okay , but not here ne . sensor needs put location , out sun , out reach your pets , children . which makes little decision making time , your part .	-1

guys , this great purchase . it quality unit bigger than it looks package . charbroil fabulous job making such good little unit such good price . unless you're looking something totally snazzy willing spend lot money , don't pass this one up	1
i bought these lounge chairs because other positive reviews i read them . i say i am very happy them too . color very nice antique color matches set we got costco few years back . i can't wait those warm summer days evenings sit around pool enjoy lounging these chairs . they not too heavy , so they easy move around . they heavy enough santa ana winds we here beautiful southern california not blow chairs around all . i think price these very good price value would recommend them . i only wish you could pick your color material cushions . beige color matches what we but little drab since our house patio cover same color . i see they sell replacement cushions different colors , but it would nice choice color when ordering originals	1
i thought when i ordered these chaise lounges ( 2 ) they would only temporary until i could afford " good ones " because they so inexpensive . well these good i don't need replace them . design actually matches my table set i didn't even realize it until we unpacked them -- fully assemled ! i only one complaint it really not bad . thickness cushion seems fine me but my skinny butt husband tells me cushions aren't cushiony enough . other than , chaises absolutely wonderful good quality	-1
this chaise lounge really exceeded my expectations . i'd shopped around didn't want spend $400 plus chaise lounge . this great price plus you get free shipping . they arrive completely assembled well packaged . very attractive , sturdy , most importantly , very comfortable . i highly recommend . got side table ice bucket love it well	1
i high ceiling so display time fuzzy i missed see-through case red night light earlier model but overall , i satisfied clock	-1
i recently purchased this clock it great little clock ! time temp cool features well projection which very cool useful . projection ( usually ceiling ) not too bright hurt your eyes when sleeping or awakening . only problem projection unless you clock side numbers project upside down . i mean say if you it facing you straight ahead numbers above clock upside down . atomic feature bit tricky also . i live central nj when setting up clock first time it didn't pick up any signal . after i searched signal , took batteries out tried everything i knew everything manual mentioned it wouldn't get signal . so i write email company they sent me response several suggestions , one worked most useful search signal ( pressing down arrow ) then while its searching place it where it recieve full signal , which shown meter left , like cell phone . once you get enough signal let it sit there until it sets itself ( you may need take it outside ) ... this take 10 mins days . my case it took 5 mins . so it set signal company says once it sets you put it where you want it keep signal . other than problem , which fixed , clock hassle free very easy use . i highly recommend it . oregon scientific also helpful i sent them thank you email stressing they need put more signal suggestions manual , because if they i wouldn't needed bother email customer service . hopefully most people didn't give up easily kept trying get signal set if they didn't they may returned clock needlessly . alarm loud enough me awaken snooze button useful top so it reached easily drowsy stupor . overall it cute , useful , stylish clock .	1
i oregon scientific clock last 7 years , finally replace it because soda spill . i knew i wanted oregon scientific clock this best choice . fact this one works better then old one ( no long cord humongous antenna ) i love time ceiling feature . yes it only works when no sunlight room but i dont sleep during day . i highly recomend this product	1

i cannot wait party . i purchased both this fire pit table . both pieces easy assemble , sturdy really fun ! my sister going so jealous . what sisters	1
different , visually striking , very comfortable . only pedantic problem hinges seem rust which may problem later , excellent value . go look crate barrel comparison	1

they very attractive we no trouble putting them together . our only complaint - stain ran during rain storm stained our patio	-1
if you searching adirondack chairs , like i few weeks ago , you find wide array prices -- too ridiculous mention . this strathwood 79.99 10 shipping steal ! i not able find them cheaper anywhere ! you get chair foot stool which why i rated it 4 stars . quality decent , i think price you get what you pay bit more . kit comes almost constructed -- you final screws . chair comes pre oiled , however i highly recommend oiling it again , if you want color last . i also recommend teaqua , not use conventional teak oil . i agree previous reviewer if you sit chair hour it get uncomfortable , however i purchased cushions it , sitting hour not problem . construciton sturdy , they sitting my deck month now all well . mahalo	-1
i ordered this my dad christmas . i worried it wouldn't fit him because he large man , but thought what heck i'll use it if he can't . i opened box i wasn't sure it looked like sack ropes . then i began unfolding , unfolding , unfolding before long thing stretched least 14 feet across my kitchen . loops just great seem so strong . only drawback its not very soft but i guess it wouldn't all sturdy made out chenille would it . now all i need buy him home depot giftcard so he get so sturdy posts hardware he set !!	1
this clock great people who sleep their backs . if you happen lying your stomach though , you turn over see time ceiling or reach over clock press snooze button briefly turn clock light . i wish clock itself lighted time display . also we 11 foot ceilings so display little dim . snooze button top . it big easy press but button turn alarm off small front below display . you grab clock awkward way hold button down second turn alarm off . clock automatically set time . i impressed this we live near bottom apartment building surrounded other tall buildings no clear view sky .	-1
i got my grill go advantage just recently very pleased so far . makers grill 2 go appear heard some criticisms earlier models taken into consideration this grill . open flame cooking preferable previous models , it still easy transport , it made tailgating friends before watching my tarheels play basketball lot fun . i completely disagree other reviewer who seems reviewing wrong product since this grill not use non-stick cooking surface cooking area	1
gadget i . price , this really neat outdoor thermometer shows high low temperature day . one important note location installation . i live . fla mounted it north facing window . you must locate it spot where direct or even somewhat direct sunlight not affect it this most likely give false readings . if you glass door or window leads screen enclosure , this would also allow fairly correct temperature reading , although this could also cause improper readings heat day metal pan roof reflect heat inside screen enclosure . all all , i love mine reccomend it . i bought 10 them christmas gave them out gifts	1
fits well . eventhough i just bought it , i think it going sustain extreme virginia weather couple years	1

this great umbrella - quality excellent price , it arrived timely packaged well . color not bright yellow , but more maize yellow , but coordinates well my brightly striped chair cushions ! i think more muted color help keep it looking nice longer - i think brighter yellow would fade and/or look discolored sooner	1
i've owned bounty hunter land star 2 years now it great , economically priced detector . shop around because you get it less then one hundred dollars if you know where look ... cough ... ebay ... cough ... ebay . i've found tons silver coins this detector . it target processor extremely reliable coins . if you get solid repeatable coin tone then you've got 95% chance digging up coin . i've also found civil war buttons , old toys , multiple rings beach . yesterday i found 2 mercury head dimes ( 1918 1941 ) local park . believe me when i tell you treasure ground everywhere . contrary review you may see below , all-metal mode works exactly it should . not only it work it should , but it most useful descriptive mode this machine . mr. david carlson obviously doesn't know how operate his metal detector . symptoms he describes result someone not reading manual . he doesn't understand relationship all-metal mode ground balance . it just takes moment read understand . bottom line : great metal detector get you into hobby cheaply so you begin finding some great stuff . like i said , i've using mine 2 years i don't feel need upgrade	1
i've only used my rack cooking chickens , but i'm looking forward doing turkey soon . i've never sprayed rack non-stick cooking spray , there no need . everything comes off , it cleans up beautifully dishwasher . i like fact i put chicken rack way before i put it grill - rack makes it easy get chicken back into house , too . i typically put rack cooked chicken cookie sheet , carve chicken right rack . well made , tons uses , yet inexpensive . it get any better	1

nice cushions dry out pretty fast . seem durable . they also seem high quality . only thing they more tan color -- picture shows them white which what i really wanted . but they nice . could use strap top also so wind doesn't constantly blow them over	-1
i didn't know much grills so i asked around . everyone told me get weber grill , after reading reviews i could see why . i just got my grill this weekend we used it 3 times already .. we love it ! very sturdy/solid , super easy use . all you need turn gas , turn knob .. press ignitor ! everything we cooked come out perfectly , very even cooking . this grill may not all bells whistles , but you bet it last years come .	1
don't hesitate buy this grill !!!! past few years i've switching back forth my gas grill my good ole weber kettle grill . like everyone else i prefer grilling over charcoal , so this seemed like perfect grill me ... i right ! this grill takes all pain away grilling charcoal . one push button 15 minutes later i am grilling ribeyes . yes ! it simple . chimney revolutionized how i grilled charcoal , but this 10 times better than tha t.t he propane ignition rocks , work area great , lid holder nice addition , water proof charcoal holder more convenient than i thought it would . let us not forget it dual purpose thermometer ! it took me 40 minutes assemble , but that expected . oh yeah , i ordered it monday it delivered thursday .	1
i just love this grill . i previously regular weber kettle charcoal grill , but when my son took it college i perfect excuse upgrade . grill large enough grill meat veggies family 4 6 . cooking grate hinged sides . this allows you easily add more coals every hour or so extended indirect grilling cooking . you won't believe how handy very large stable table ; it very durable cleans up nicely . store your large bag charcoal rain protected bin , then just pull out bag pour charcoal right into 2 charcoal holders . charcoal holders keep coals gathered together light well eliminate need " charcoal chimney " . you only need run propane burner 5 minutes get coals started , so one canister lasts quite long . ( i always set timer so i don't forget turn it off . ) charcoal holders perfect indirect grilling , just push them sides kettle when coals ready . if direct grilling , you still use charcoal holders heat coals , then use tongs dump coals onto bottom grate when they ready . very convenient . bottom wire shelf makes perfect spot set hot charcoal holders after you dump coals into grill . stainless steel ash catcher works very well . ( non-stainless ash catcher my regular kettle grill didn't work smoothly used catch jam sometimes . ) lid holder really great . just pick up lid slide it left it held place you . no more trying hang lid little lid hook . thermometer very handy monitor temperature longer cooking items . if you bbqing ribs or roast , keeping temperature regulated low important . all these little conveniences simply add up nice cooking experience . i enjoy my gas grill too , but it takes little more skill cook over charcoal . i feeling accomplishment satisfaction when i serve up perfectly cooked meal my beautiful weber performer grill . find spot show it off - this beauty really looks great yard	1
i love this thing . it , course , basically weber kettle , which all you need . tweaks terrific , though . gas starter works like charm . i'd thought moving lighter fluid chimney made getting grill going almost clean predictable turning your kitchen oven , but this even better . work surface really handy , kettle top holder dirt-simple but works just fine , charcoal trays indirect cooking nice , charcoal storage handy ( but more this minute ) . built-in thermometer really asset . it ordinary meat thermometer sit top kettle or removed use food . it very helpful when slow-cooking using kettle top know what temperature ( fun , beside , see grill " breathe " coals burn down , or you add more , or vents get adjusted , or whatever ) . then when you're you pull it out check meat . simple but great . all little things add up make this cut above . few things . instructions come grill read mean it necessary use charcoal trays gas starter . you don't; either chimney or just pile charcoal work perfectly well . turning gas knob just enough get flame , running starter short times , extend tank life ; three minutes or so seems plenty get fire started . look scoop or something similar use charcoal holder , or plan getting your hands dirty moving charcoal . overall , though , this great setup . i hickory-smoked leg lamb last night die , two-and-a-quarter hours pressing starter button table . fabulous .	1
this truely must . flat non-stick skewers holds everything place , they won't flop around so unbalanced pieces food always bottom near heat . friend told me these gander mountain selling $7.39 set , but i checked here 1st found them $5.99 set . i ordered 5 sets !! skewers 14 " long plenty food . get yours today , don't wait . get least 2 sets .	1
i one these , this one my sister motorhome . it makes great little game or card table , eating doing small craft table . folds up nicely height adjustment .	1
bench easy assemble , lid actuallydoes work well . it not item lastforever , but it priced fairly what it -- storagebench .	-1
this storage bench great storing pool items or anything you keep outside . it easy put together i got it friday sale $69.99 , so price awesome ! all other benches like this i researched over $100.0	1
this table twice table you would expect price . its size ideal 2 passenger teak bench . kompur wood so like teak ; we're staining our teak furniture match kompur wood . it looks marvelous 30 " round folding table . fit finish plus . can't rate durability yet or it would 5 stars	-1
i agree previous reviewer who noted temperature discrepancy . items placed closer firebox get much hotter than those smokestack end . this probably my only complaint this smoker . this problem moderated somewhat . you create makeshift baffle aluminum flashing help some . you also put aluminum drip pan full water directly front opening which not only deflect some heat but introduce some humidity into cooking section . personally , i just don't fill it up meat . if you're doing several slabs ribs , use rib rack far end . airflow temperature control problems me first . my particular smoker works best air intake vent completely closed . this not air-tight smoker so it still drawing air through cracks door . keeping fire low vent closed , temperature doesn't climb over 250 degrees . concerning temperature -- forget putting thermometer space provided brinkmann . it too high lid it read quite bit higher than food grate level . heat rises , you know . i drilled hole just above handle mounted thermometer . when i cook grates upper level , this thermometer reads just right level food . when i cook lower level , actual temperature 30-50 degrees lower than what this thermometer reads . it not totally precise but , hey , it barbeque!!!i've this smoker 3-4 years . i keep it under covered area so it doesn't get rained but humidity my area always high . i've repaint it once . firebox needs repainting now but that only maintenance i've it . i just clean out ashes food drippings after each use roll it under covering until next time . before each use , i line firebox cooking section heavy duty aluminum foil . makes clean-up lot easier . ( what we before reynolds ? )i don't smoke lot brinkmann . mostly i use weber kettle grill . but every time i brisket or big roast or several slabs ribs , i crank this baby up it never failed me yet . keep temperature low , keep eye fire don't open cooking section very often . just let nature , low heat smoke their job .	-1
i mine 4 years it worked out great . main difference this offset barbecue more expensive ones lack complete air control . there simply too many open seams allow air . so ... it takes bit tending keep temperature 215f . said , bit patience practice , you make excellent barbecue this thing . metal gauge heavy enough last you several years ( though eventually firebox burn out )	-1
i purchased this last year i love this grill . i always check consumer reports they rated this very highly - i agree . cooking cinch this grill - wide grill cooks evenly ! only way this grill catch fire if you not clean grease after each cooking session . fortunately , lowe putting whole bunch these grills together when i looking one so i bought one fully assembled . way cool	1
after few years use , original rack my gold grill rusty unusable . this exact replacement fits like original , making grill much more usuable again .	1
i changed my stinger rating 5 , 1 ( there no o ! )stinger : pros- mosquito lure , killed lotsa bad insects ( first , then wouldn't zap small insects !? )- but ! cons- their electric wire grid uses square wires quickly clog up . pretty soon it packed solid killing nothing ! i keep blowing it out ( air compressor ) every couple days- hassle ! flowtron " 80 ! " ( took puny 40 back ! )- pros- killed lots more bugs , because it never clogs up ( zaps small insects too ! ) ! electric rods straight up/down , so no cross wires catch falling insects clog . dead insects fall out bottom- blow clean once month ... i used stinger mosquito lure , purchased wally world ... cons- only con outer protective plastic cage bars only 1/2 " apart ( same stinger)- this kept larger moths ... able easily get electric grid . i used large wire cutter cut out every 3d bar- top 2/3ds cage- alternating ..., so cut bar middle two solid bars adajacent side- still rigid ! i put it outside timer ( when evenings cool down- not much insect activity below 55 degrees ... ) . adjust accordingly . never hang it near door , their always 10'+ swarm insects around it . try hang it over head high , dry ( electric ) area .	1
accurate , easy program good look . well worth $ spent	1
i've this weather station month now . it seems get accurate readings - only if you find good spot your remote sensor . bit sunshine make your readings higher than normal ( outside ) . couple complaints : one reviewer said buttons make unit feel cheap , they feel clunky . but , i only used them get it all setup so its no big deal . i've some mixed results barometer . when actual pressure mid-range its right ( i've chcked some readings local airports see how acurate it ) . but when low or high pressure system moves readings off more than i'd expect . however important thing you see pressure changing right direction . lastly , forecasting model it uses hasn't worked me ... yet . i live west denver , close mountains . this probably creates local weather pattern unit cannot predict . i not expect it , but we've some rain , snow , fog unit claims it observe not . it only month so i expect see prediction accurate some time . overall , i am happy this product think it worth money . there many other models i looked i think this gives most money	-1
cover great . velcro holds cover place wrapping around handles , preventing wind blowing it off . it nice leave fireplace out winter , knowing it protected elements .	1
very easy set up . pop aa battery , push button back your time zone us ( or you set manually , but then why ? unless you out us time zones . ) find spot wall it , hammer nail , leaving it stick out little hold clock , put clock up ( hardest part , it just hole flush back , but ! if you put it close door , you see hole nail ) walla ! few minutes , clock sets itself ! what could more easy ? my cat even found it amusing watch clock hands move until reached exact time ! ;) clock made finely textured plastic outside , but looks lot nicer than picture . great match black , silver /or designer computers , black leather desk chairs , etc . office or computer room . directions say set it up late night preferrably , if used interior rooms office buildings it may not able pick up signal set , thus you'd it manually . clock larger than it looks well , which easier eyes than other clocks . price certainly right well . i bought old black school-type clock my kids when they young , very similar this one , since my son took it him when he moved out i wanted replacement ! ( my mom bought old one when my youngest baby , when my older child learning tell time . it through dropped when moving , few earthquakes just keeps ticking ! i feeling this one same it well made compared many less expensive clocks out there - espcially projection type , which i thought might great idea until i saw reviews how many different projection clocks simply don't work , cheaply made , friend daughter got one her birthday , which didn't work either . ) great kids learning tell time too , so this could go just anywhere modern decor room . awesome ! i'm very happy it so far	1
this lounge/deck chair cushon worth every peny . it thick , comfortable ( none those deck chairs comfortable without substantial cushion ) , available several color choices , soft , not plasticky , cover fabric . you measure width your deck chair carefully see if it fit . it just barely fit my ' titanic ' deck chair because i scrunch it up bit near arms . but all turned out well i must say i am very happy it . it quality product keep you much more comfortable during your hours patio than those cheaper , but much thinner , types sold outlet stores or supermarkets summer . get best . this it	1
good product general . one came bit bent clever automatic lock unlock wouldn't work until i unbent it . i ordered 3 , billed three received 2 . amazon now " junk " my inbox	-1
i use this tailgating primarily . it great because it cooking size much bigger than it counterparts . it holds temps well cooks evenly like all webers . it bit bigger than smaller smokey joe , but nicer job because it size . i use it often continue so . too bad it discontinued .	1
weber discontinued it amazon no longer it . my pal condo balcony ( not large ) this weber her - equip it one charcoal rail you get lots indirect heat smoking . usually 14 inch smokey joe too small , often my 22 inch performer too big , but this jumbo joe just right . weber - bring it back !!	1
this excellent little grill home or road . lid lock godsend side benefit due construction piece , smokey joe apt name . carry handle awesome . side vents direct air such i almost always beautiful smoke filling my little grill infusing my meal fabulous flavor . i've mine over decade while i've gone through big weber kettle now huge smoker , this little number still race i no intentions giving it up . i'm taking it camping me next weekend . it no-brainer . buy it happy	1
whatever reason , weber renamed genesis line spirit 2007 . i just bought new weber genesis 3 weeks ago ( prior name change ) after owning my last one 11 years . there 3 burner model 2 burner model . if you're reading this you're looking 2 burner model . excellent product . 2 burners more than sufficient ; i don't know why they even 3 burner model since 3 burner model isn't really much bigger . 2 burner model plenty room needs everyday family grilling entertaining decent size group . there plenty product info this page amazon manufacturer , so let me tell you few things i make my weber work best me . -most importantly ... keep it covered . amazon sells cover ... get it . not coving it cut its life half least . -cover funnel shaped grease drip pan tin foil change it regularly ; otherwise build-up trap catch fire not make steak taste very good . -change disposable grease traps regularly ( otherwise they start stink ) . -get yourself quality wire brush use it before each use ... not after . build-up cooking grates after each use actually protects them elements . -before each use , after you wire brush grates , put some cooking oil some paper towels wipe grates down . -pre-heat grill high least 5 - 10 minutes ; it burns off anything left over cleaning makes cooking grates nice hot . -initiate cooking steaks , chops , any cuts meat ( even burgers ... no , not hot dogs ) just-over-medium heat no more than 2 minutes each side flip before cooking your liking . this brief searing each side locks flavor your cut meat . -cook closed cover ; normal cuts meat shouldn't take more than total 10 minutes ( including searing ) . -let your meat sit up 5 minutes before slicing ( or biting into it ! ) . this locks juices ; if juices too hot when you slice ( or bite ) , they'll run right out your cut meat . there you go . hope helps . don't forget cover grill after it cools . bon appetit !	1
so far i am very happy this purchase . it seems relatively accurate temperature , humidity pressure readings , atomic clock sets itself every night . i love sunrise/sunset times well moon phase displays , it very easy get data any city any date without permenantly change date or city unit . very cool . i don't like fact moon phase display " backwards " - full moon , my opinion , should full white circle new moon should black circle . this unit shows moon black instead white . but once you get used this , it no big deal . i really like fact all buttons front unit . some other la crosse products buttons back or other hard reach places . i found few problems design . there curved glass ( or plastic ) cover over entire display very reflective . reflections make it impossible read across room . fact it difficult read standing right front it because reflections . it best stand just slightly right or left . i excited fact display shows high low temperature humidity all times each 3 sensors . however , i dissapointed you can't recall date time high low recorded , you other la crosse products . also , when you reset high/low , you reset all sensors once instead able reset each individually . it challenging set up 3 remote sensors , especially when you more than 1 base unit , but it ( i also la crosse alarm clock projects time outdoor temp ceiling , so i wanted get both units read same sensor #1 ) . although this may sound like negative review , it really not . features functionality this unit far outweigh it shortcomings . i would definitely recommend this anyone who wants features it provides . make sure dimensions fit your needs . it might bit large sit desk - best hang it wall . it also comes oak instead brushed aluminum sides .	-1

i am impressed accuracy durability this item , but it far " instant read " . i conduct several temperatue audits major food chain many readings take several minutes stabilize . overall , it worth cost	-1

this attractive 10 " clock , white face , silver bezel ( also available black ) . unique feature ability synchronize atomic clock ( wwwvb ) ft . collins , co . watching hands speed around dial it initially sets itself worth price clock itself . we bought one play room liked it so much we bought two more . after placing battery , clock begins searching signal . generally it only takes couple minutes sync , but it came take up 24 hours . you need set time zone which you live ( pacific , eastern , etc ) . clock automatically adjusts dst ( part wwwvb signal , apparently ) . if you live areas country don't recognize dst , there button clock disable dst offset . note clock receive wwwvb signal , it cannot shielded environment . we've no problems our home placing unit various rooms outside window , but i suspect it might not work windowless basement ( which case it functions regular clock ) . my company bought ton similar clocks , only find they cannot receive signal windowless , steel building . your mileage may vary	1
this good brush , i think it bit overpriced though . i would rather saved money got brush . it good , but not worth this much	-1
i bought this unit some adirondack chairs small table so i may sit outside during winter ( not severe weather ) smoke cigar . i must say besides attractive easy assemble this fire pit allows anywhere from2 6 people comfortably sit around it stay warm . i burn hard woods it anywhere neighborhood 2 - 4 hours not noticed any warping or buckling , door little flexible but it made same screen material rest unit holding up nicely . it opens closes easily . if your wood propensity popping i noticed screen material could considered touch too large , but i don't think it enough minus give this fire pit any less ratin	1

there really nothing more said further reputation this series grills . those us own genesis e-310 series grill know how well this grill manufactured , just how very well it performs its duties . it , far , very best gas grill this price range i ever owned or used . couple notes : -the cross-over ignition system works wonderfully ( it takes less than 3 seconds fire up all three burners-those who say their gas grill not get hot enough sear meats don't own this grill- i've it up 550 degrees very cold mn winter day-that said , it seems go through good amount propane when running all 3 burners high ... but probably obvious considering temps you obtain when running it full . ( it interesting see if i get 500 + degrees sear meats medium setting summer day .... ) . fuel gauge inside cabinet also handy feature-as always this series grills- no flare ups , flavorizer bars what weber says they , namely vaporize fats juices into smoke adds flavor what you grilling-to keep this review balanced , there one negative- i dislike tool holders . although there plenty , your tools pretty much one those leather hanging loop things keep tools falling off or even use holders ( small price pay i guess)finally , genesis e-310 i purchased came copper color , something i haven't seen amazon , or weber site matter . maybe i missed it , or maybe i got lucky . either way , it looks pretty darn sharp our deck when it isn't covered	1

good move part brilliant engineers weber who decided go 18 1/2 instead 19 ! gold touch ??? try diamond platinum touch ! this grill baby queen inside mardi gras cake ! really excellent grill ash tray makes it easy clean , two wheels always better than one . i admit , however this not exactly one touch grill , unless you own personal cooking cyborg touch grill you if you touch its button .. once . that beside point though .. bottom line ? this grill isn't bare bones , but it affordably chique grill-worty funtymes goodness	1

tekquest mosquito catcher sturdy , well built device actually what it claims . after setting up unit according directions , i allowed it run 24 hr mode . ( it also nightime only mode ) i let it run few days checked collection tray . sure enough , remains thousands mosquitos , moth or two , collected . once mosquitos captured , remains begin decomposing process , so there very little left pests . after letting it run 24 hr mode several weeks i switched it night only mode . once sun sets unit turns , runs allnight until sun comes out . so far it worked flawlessly , sitting out our patio become welcomed event again . thank you tekquest	1
my first objective find alarm clock programmable snooze -- this one got it . second objective large enough day-to-day use but also useable travelling -- this one i t.t he projection feature works great me -- it razor sharp even it lowest setting very clear . if you can't see it day time , look he front clock ( which also lit leds pushing any one button ) . yes , buttons not sturdiest , but i believe need use them often negated fact it radio-controlled . you set alarm display preference once you walk away . $20.00 alarm clock , i think it fantastic value	1
this tiny alarm clock really cool . you read manual adjust how big bright you want projection ceiling . you also adjust how loud different patterns you want alarm sound . it tells temperature also . i liked it so much i bought my mom one	1

we really bad bug problem ( inherited trailer when we got it ) - these things work - no bugs my sisters or mothers houses anymore , but we still bugs . we move 2 units around recommended - bugs get use them . also stuff your house absorb noise making them less effective - we wall wall stuff 3 kids tiny trailer . effectively our trailer would take 8 - 10 units . bugs we see easier catch seem disoriented . these buzzers best used wide open spaces minor middling bug problems . spiders beetles moths totally disappered though . our dog hates things when we move one over her bed . so , these units need moved every 2-4 weeks . you need multiple units - 1 every 200 sq . ft . least - if you lots furniture or smaller rooms , then more - they don't work through walls or furniture . you need least one every room you problem . it takes 2 - 3 weeks really start see results . works better if you fewer bugs - really bad bug problem - use conjunction other solutions	1

bounty hunter iv metal detector simple use . owner manual easy follow . we used it beach around our property . we haven't found anything valuable yet , but its fun try	1
low cost metal detector i give this thing five stars . i bought this detector several months back enjoy it relative ease use , it find what you searching ( coins , rings , earings , necklaces , etc ) . other reviews here pretty much wrap it up good ( affordable ! ) unit , but i wanted make few comments amateur point view : - this detector , course , discrimination circuitry used tell difference various metals helping you avoid digging up junk like soda pull tabs which everywhere . it work pretty good , but - i found using tracker iv discriminator , you most likely missing some good stuff . i gone back over " discriminated " areas again " all metal " mode found some nice stuff discriminate didn't catch . granted i am no pro , but fact if you want get every coin , every ring , or every cool item various metals , you may want consider just using " all metal " mode . i almost exclusively use it now although i sift through some absolute junk . i found bunch coins , necklaces , pendants , etc i would otherwise missed . use discriminate mode when looking gold wedding ring your wife through you back yard ... - invest 4 inch " gold nugget coil " which far superior pinpointing metal . stock coil works fine but tad ambiguous precisely where your coin , ring , ( or pull tab ) . smaller coil reduces search time i am glad i one . - i bought recommended bounty hunter headphones ( save battery power ) , but found them bit more trouble than help . when i detect something i squat or sit down dig . i set detector down so coil near dig zone so i waive clumps dirt ( or sand ) front coil i search . problem headphone wire tends always way when i perform this move . i get tired " untangling " so i don't use them anymore . maybe i'm just getting old . - meter no value anyone who hear audible report . it no " range " judge metals you passing over . it simply swings hard right no matter what what i tell . i tried different modes different metals test it , but it seems merely swing hard right you pass over any type metal / alloy . i see how this would still useful deaf person , but it just easily could bright light bulb instead meter . i won't ding this low cost detector though because i'd still dig if it half scale or pegged . - lastly warning . if you go into park , or any area attended kids , you spotted . within short amount time you surrounded kids " helping you " dig up buried treasure . point you decide whether meanie bark them , or write rest hunt off let them shred area every time detector beeps . i generally tell them how it long day " see ya " since they invariably their hands there digging away no matter what you say ...	1

i use this watch business trip all over world , function very nice , compass , temperature , weather forecast functions very useful , especially , baro-chart very important assist judge correct weather forecast . color very nice , but someone mentioned it would discolor , i think it should , but not happen yet , because it always staid very good condition ( only business trip ) , but if i go mountain-climbing , i suppose it might happen soon . then why i not give 5 stars , only disadvantage dual time mode , show local home town time same display very very important during business trip , it tell when i should call back my company , display still enough space display home town time , i think la crosse should consider improve this function . anyway , this still useful watch business trip	-1
so far device entirely lived up expectations . atomic clock feature works fine range accuracy remote sensor seems fair enough -- there often 1-2 degree difference sensor main unit if set right next each other , but this minor uses we get out it ( quick look outside temps during winter ) . only issue we ran into " problematic " ice alarm feature . this feature sets off devices alarm anytime temperature drops 32 27 degrees or so alert you possible icy conditions . problem cold climates temperature hovers range all winter long ... so alarm goes off continually every 40 seconds or so . we just happened upon solution worked perfectly . ice alarm only works channel 1 . so , if you set outside sensor channel 2 or 3 ice alarm disabled no longer triggered . obviously , they should ability shut it off , but this it ... even this isn't listed instructions	-1

i got this gift my dad , while shipping time i got proper product , packaging not suitable giving this item gift . box which these tongs arrived ( actual product box , not cardboard shipping box ) all dented weird stickers it ( i am assuming some sort inventory purposes whatever warehouse this came ) . anyway , my dad isn't one care sort thing , but if i given this anyone else , i would embarrassed . neat product though . very handy .	-1
this alarm clock some nice features . it two separate alarms , each one makes different buzzing noise . it also tells temp ., shows different time zones . only draw back , other reviews pointed out , it not project well light . this doesn't matter night , but morning it would nice	-1
after gilling undersized two-burner char-broil ten years , i decided it time upgrade weber . i used gril now few weeks it best - direct grilling , perfectly searing steaks , grill roasting , even slow barbecuing . if you're looking this grill , you're probably also considering other webers , like genesis silver . go this one . price difference $100 , you get steel flavorizer bars , double layer stainless steel hood , bigger storage area , dual work surfaces . note design : i thought lp tank housed inside cabinet below grill - actually it under right work surface ( not big deal , but hard tell photos ) . only down-side stainless steel cooking grates ( extremely durable , but not best either conducting or retaining heat ) , i prefer cast iron its heat-retention , so i picked up some porcelain-enamaled cast iron grates certain big box orange home improvement store before grill even arrived . cooking this grill heaven . we like barbecue ( low slow , wood chips smoker box ) , this grill handled task wonderfully . my old grill , even low , wood chips would ignite turn ash 15 minutes , giving food nice sooty flavor . this grill , even though it gets very hot very fast , medium wood slowly smoldered just like it supposed . great smokey flavor . we'll doing our thanksgiving turkey it this year ! sure , this grill little pricey , but quality means you won't replace it . long run , great deal high quality product	1
this hinged grate easily allows you put extra charcoal or even move them around while still cooking food . original quite frustrating , you easily could drop your food onto ground while trying access hot charcoals . while one should bought larger grill cooking beyond several people , i'm stuck my 18 incher hinged grill must , i guarantee you can't live without it or you'll always say i should bought one when it too late	1
i very pleased this product . it easy use , works great super easy clean after use . no more tring pour thick oil through funnel filter . filters also easy wash reuse despite instructions contrary	1
this set all you need bbq !!! it it all , good quality . great price too !! thanks amazon.com	1

if you caterer or own restaurant , then you probably effectively use 22 " wok . i loved idea huge wok , but failed anticipate challenges it brings : 1 . i couldn't season it standard oven . i resort using burner season it turning it . it laborious experience . 2 . i can't easily clean it standard sink . good thing i'm cooking next hose . get 18 " , or search amazon " wok shop " get 14 " or 16 " . other than , after spending 1/2 day manually seasoning wok , i've just cooked best fried rice my life	1

this great way monitor temperature location . it either inside or outside , but it must within 60 feet main unit . walls or other obstacles reduce distance . you monitor up three different locations . only problem i encountered main unit sometimes loses track remote unit . however , it always automatically found unit within few minutes .	-1

afficianado collector buckets , i ecstatic when i came across this 2 gallon galvanized wonder . it beauty wonder cannot overstated . it quite simply mercedes-benz buckets , if i may say . i ordered this amazing product days spent waiting it probably longest my life . when it finally arrived , i eagerly ripped open box tore off paper covering dover parkersburg 610 . all packaging wasn't even necessary , because this bucket folks , hold your hats , made metal ! that right , 100% metal . advertised , it quite capable holding water , but moniker far too restrictive . this versatile container hold equal amounts * any * liquid you think . test it claim it holds two gallons , i went out bought two gallons buttermilk my local dairy vendor . i poured both gallons creamy goodness inside 610 , my surprise , it held both gallons ! then , course , i faced problem drink two gallons buttermilk . long story short , 610 able handle resulting two gallons vomit ! days later , when i got out hospital , cleaning 610 no problem . galvanized surface made cleanup snap . i found countless other uses this versatile bucket since then . highly recommended	1
purchased my first thgr168 remote sensor sept . 06 second sensor feb . 07 . they flawlessly send their signals oregon scientific bar388hga weather station . i've yet replace alkaline batteries either thgr168 . third sensor ( thgr122n ) came weather station set up outdoors using lithium batteries ; it measured down -25 degrees during its first winter . when i first got sensors , i set up all them side side day . units measure temperature ( or ) within tenth point humidity -- if humidity below 40% or above 70% , they also show ' dry ' or ' wet ' unit window . tiny red light flashes each time signal sent . i noticed temperature readings fairly close , within degree or so each other . humidity readings further apart , much 5 percentage points . 3 units , one outside , one attached garage third unit currently kitchen , it nice benefit see temp humidity directly sensor well base station . using wire stand comes units , they easily moved place place . there also wall mount more permanent installation . reception excellent through many four walls two floors ; units within 40 feet base station -- i think oregon scientific claims reception up 100 ft . only outside unit signal occasionally disappears command weather station -- signal navigates 4 walls . move command station slightly different angle info reappears . average or better lighting , read-out easy view . improvement might backlit button see lcd readout dim light . direct sunlight or shade affect readings . these digital units work well . i wouldn't claim them precise instruments but they generally accurate ; nowhere specs orgsci make claim concerning precision	-1

this metal detector nice , notwithstanding , it performs poorly when all metal mode . initially all metal mode works fine , however , after half hour use batteries begin wear out battery low indicator not come . when all metal mode used after half hour detector use , it just squeals uncontrollably . it supposed go off over metal pin point source your initial find great accuracy . again , after thirty minutes use detector , it no longer go off over source , it just go off constantly , no mater where you hold it . i could hold it into air it still squeals . i made every adjustment i could it just continues make noise . this mode worthless unless your using it two fresh 9 volt batteries every half hour . finally , if you're hunting say meteorites four hours , you expect spend over $56.00 batteries afternoon	-1

one star lowest rating i give this system it frankly not worth even . problems start design . you take out eight tiny little screws insert backup batteries or plug sensor cable into nifty looking " solar powered " sender unit , which placed somewhere full sunlight it function all . once you've mounted unit your roof , you remove those pesky little screws roof , freezing wind usually , several times winter . or wait spring nice weather when you don't need know if you expect black ice your early morning drive work . sometimes resetting base station works ( which you place inconveniently so unit direct line sight communication . usually not . os sales it advertised 300 feet , but actually something less than forty if your batteries more than day old ( see battery change procedure above ) . way , there backup nicad battery unit , supposedly kept charged impressive solar power collector . this fail because it rapidly loses capacity due poor discharge recharge cycle . if any these three fail , unit won't function . strangely enough , my rain gauge ( i live desert ) continued function over year little attention . however , temp/humidity sensor which i would like refer most often , what fails every night . i'd like replace nicad battery , but can't find one anywhere . ahem . customer service lack it . i don't know how many emails i've sent . or calls i've placed . or time i've spent listening backside oregon scientific hold button . their website only lists complete systems replacement parts category . while assumptions dangerous , my only option seems scrap $300 worth two-year old hardware buy more , more , more . this well-intended gift . i'm trying make it work . but it doesn't , usually when i need it most .	-1
we took chance these part father day gift piece metal acts spring broke after only 1 use . after reading reviews i called company instead returning refund . they very nice sent out one . this one just broke - exactly like other one - after month use . overall design tongs great like other raichlen products but construction severely lacking . don't waste your money this model .	-1

i more or less forced buy this product because i very precise size requirements this product fitted them . i very disappointed quality product cost . it comes 19 different pieces , all which hollow plastic polymer . it fairly lightweight , which could good or bad depending what you plan it . $200+ price , you'd think they would include shelf , but they only give you stencil make it yourself out ' shelving material ' . my biggest complaint i missing four pieces other extra pieces when i received it . i got bounced back forth amazon suncast customer service before i got right people suncast send me replacement parts ( which took over week arrive ) . top , they didn't even send me right replacement parts ! after phone call explanation , more parts sent . if i keep extras i , make couple more calls , i may enought second shed . ugh . directions ok , but they'll make you scratch your head you look through all similiar looking parts . especially when they don't send you right pieces	-1

you won't find single expert hummingbirds who recommends " instant nectar " products such this one . why ? because 1 ) they're complete waste your money 2 ) they expose birds ridiculously high concentrations inadequately tested chemicals . cheapest easiest feeder solution also happens closest chemical composition natural flower nectar : solution 3 or 4 parts water one part ordinary white sugar . if you want sugar dissolve faster , get additive-free superfine baking sugar . don't use honey , food coloring , kool-aid , jello , or any other junk - birds drink nectar just energy get everything else their bodies need eating insects	-1

when i bought this product , it said " new " ! however , upon opening package it arrived , cooker already opened inner box . i though perhaps someone just opened inner box check item before it sent ? i opened inner box , one " legs " cooker broken off rusted ! i needed use this right away so i not send it back . now i get this " leg " welded back ! beware " new " designation !	-1
price i paid i expected much more accuracy . data it downloads its external monitor pc terrible . even though unit synchronized atomic clock it still seems get dates wrong data it stores its database . it also problem accumulated rainfall . amount rainfall according database much higher what display shows accumulated amount . hourly 24 hour period also tend behave eratically . you might see inch rain last hour but when you come back later , last 24 hours shows only . 2 inches rain . strange . how you more rain last hour than last 24 ? seems backwards . good side , unit easy set up connects your pc existing ports cable provided . bad side , besides inaccurate , analysis software primitive difficult work . you better off downloading text file doing analysis excel . this unit also gives eratic readings temperature swinging up down up six degrees within twenty minute window . i wanted my son see how temps over 24 hour period form bell shaped curve . so much . this probably ok first time weather station my 8 year old but i would not recommend it any one else since this unit not cheap . one other thing , it only takes reading every 1-3 minutes so wind speed readings hit miss . you could getting gusts much higher than what this unit happens read . i am dissapointed annoyed i spent money it not least semi-accurate . i tell you i it set up wireless . if you use enclosed hard wire connection option then you get more frequent readings maybe even better accuracy . good luck your homework first .	-1
i unit 3yrs . rain guage repaired once . didn't work one more year . just storm 50 mile hour winds . i watched wind guage , it showed 18 miles hour . need i say more !	-1
this hummingbird feeder looked like good idea until i filled it ( following direction ) put it up window it fell off 15 seconds later glass busted	-1
i dissappointed this product . it freyed untied hammock strings when i got it out box . pricey it originally i expected least swing manufactured well . but this terrible . it looked like it wasn't even completely assembled	-1
i received this watch gift after reviewing several others . display very good . altimiter usually way off varies greatly even remaining same position . it little difficult make use all watch features . i am very concerned watch stamped back " water resistant " but new reports showing it not . fact if it not , we misled manufacturer . overall , i not recommend this watc	-1
i currently two feeders back yard hummingbirds . i love way this one looks but birds don't feed it i'm not sure why . other one empty they still don't come this one	-1
purchased rotisserie basket after reading other reviews . i found basket work great . you put your meat grilled clamp down pieces . very easy . rock cornish game hens though , i needed tie them little bit , but because little legs . . . well little . never one before just skewer kind . cleans fairly easy too . love it .	1
this nice rotisserie . it could use basket keep meat getting away it it cooks ( shrinks process ) . you need pliers tighten loosen baskets	1
we got clock , read instructions , installed battery hung it east / west wall . after sun went down , clock able receive station set itself correct time . it worked flawlessly last two months since we got it . it nice correct time all time kids don't worry getting out time catch bus because clock off	1
one thing which mystifies me how few people embraced latest modern clock technology : radio controlled clocks which keep exact time automatically synchronizing themselves signals broadcast incredibly accurate u.s. atomic clock boulder colorado . such clocks not only always accurate fraction second , they also automatically set themselves daylight savings standard time appropriate . furthermore , such clocks typically quite reasonable price . yet while most americans , example , latest modern cordless phones cell phones , relatively few accuracy convenience radio controlled clocks . this model just one many styles sold amazon other vendors . try one i think you'll glad you . my wife i several these clocks throughout our house take accurate time granted , no what time system effect	1
this brush just awesome , good price boot ! works perfect my weber grill .	1
clock set itself right away during daytime it performed very well point . all i put battery it hang it wall facing general direction colorado i experienced no problems it then or now . i would advise anyone get one these clocks since they perform well accurate	1
pop battery forget it , it sets itself right dot even after daylight savings time came	1
really goes good my room . i really like it automatically synchronise per time zone daytime savings ...	1
i purchased 2 these clocks now . moment i inserted batteries clock started advancing stopped 4 ' o ' clock . i getting ready ship it back thinking it bad clock . but within 5 minutes both clocks received transmission corrected themselves exact time . so moral story don't return clocks without giving it some time it looks like these clocks stop 4 doesn't move all till it receives time	1
note : amazon description not include dimensions . package it recommends you measure first . it fits smokers 30 " ( 76cm ) across ( perhaps including handles , not sure ) 36 " ( 91cm)vertically . it bit big my standard-sized smoker ( 20 " across ) , so it unflattering its graceful curves , but good enough useful . it cheaply made , but looks like it suitable . i update my report if it falls apart use ( like reviewer said ) . it quite possible garbage bag would enough protect your grill . main advantage here it fits bit better , elastic close bottom bit . it probably looks bit better , if you care	1
keeps ribs searing . lower profile than most rib racks so it easier turn rib	1
i using this rack all summer still yet see it rust someone mentioned earlier review . rack certainly space saver comes handy when you lot grilling . i used it when smoking chicken ribs my weber kettle , noticed meat may tend touch when placed rack so not all areas may exposed smoke . if this happens , i may rotate pieces or just leave it like it since i'm not entering anything competition ! everything still same great taste but parts not exposed smoke different color .	1
i love this clock ! it big enough see all around back yard , looks great . keep mind they recommend keeping it sheltered extreme weather ... we ours under upper deck , so it sheltered rain . that extreme weather gets here los angeles	1
this grill great alternative expensive larger grills , perfect entry level weber apartment etc . only thing i think i dont care handle gets very hot so careful	1
we bought this use beach house , grills provided houses always dreadful . it worked perfectly grill shrimp , hamburgers hot dogs . it easy transport easy use very little assembly required	1
just make sure people don't make same mistake i , aware this not compatible weber 200 silver portable propane gas grill . amazon.com lists this rotisserie accessory weber 200 , so it amazon deserves low rating so i just given this current average 4 stars	1
it works new jersey , just wait night before you say something else	1
short it this clock performs its job quite admirably . you insert single aa battery then press one four buttons back tell it whether you eastern time , central time , mountain time , or pacific time . wait bit - mine received signal 3 minutes later , some people wait overnight . it receives radio signals colorado it readjust itself nightly keep near perfect time . it also factor daylight savings time . these it well - so it gets 5 stars because it what it supposed . however , if you live east coast , you must recognize you farther away radio source . this clock may not able set itself unless , example , placed near window . this not fault clock , but rather limitation radio waves . otherwise , clock seems well made , wood looks real , numbers easy read distance	1
like all weber products i owned , this brush excellent job	1
brush good job loosening grit grime your grill , but you still going break down wash grill soap water now then . brush strong wooden handle , leather loop , sturdy set bristles , grill scraper tough jobs . sure buy this longer brush 12-inch one not reach , especially larger grills	1
clock set itself right away during daytime it performed very well point . all i put battery it hang it wall facing general direction colorado i experienced no problems it then or now . i would advise anyone get one these clocks since they perform well accurate	1
it radium so we see time dark during night without turning light	1
this great clock . looks good , makes no noise , very easy read . setup should simple , but i would suggest adding button change manual automatic . you usually don't get clock midnight you want setup it right beginning . since it not going able sync early afternoon , you want set time manually leave clock sync night . but this where additional button comes handy , cause moving hands same button its hard know if clock left automatic or not	1
we bought this clock replace one those cheap quartz wall clocks our new ( used ) motorhome . i wanted it so i would not wear watch but would still dependable accurate time piece . it took couple nights before lacrosse atomic clock received signal synch up , but after it seems working exactly advertised , accurate right second . this clock large protrudance back where clock works reside so bezel not sit flush wall . either large hole needs cut wall or you just live it . no big deal , but it something difficult see photos internet . this why i gave it 4 out 5 stars	1
cover exactly what i needed protect our smoker weather . it strong appears durable . i felt price fair this product	1
i using this rack all summer still yet see it rust someone mentioned earlier review . rack certainly space saver comes handy when you lot grilling . i used it when smoking chicken ribs my weber kettle , noticed meat may tend touch when placed rack so not all areas may exposed smoke . if this happens , i may rotate pieces or just leave it like it since i'm not entering anything competition ! everything still same great taste but parts not exposed smoke different color .	1
great looking quite large . easy see distance , though other two dials correspondingly small . updates quickly automatically unfailingly accurate . i wish i dozen them . price very reasonable also . i certainly buy more these clocks eventually .	1
this great little barbecue . carne asadaa teryaki flank ribs , this little guy great job .	1
while we've used coleman folding stoves years , if you trunk space , there no reason earth limit yourself small stove when you grill this wonderful tabletop grill . small tank makes this practical camping . if you want real barbecue while tenting under stars , you camp where tailgate or picnic table available , this great choice camping equipment . we still like coleman boiling water , but i love barbecuing propane grill like this	1
enough cheap looking patio umbrellas tear bend after 3 or so thunderstorms ? try this one ! very nice design , looks great , simulated wood finish pole , easy open close . we very satisfied	1
just received one housewarming gift . used it twice am sure it " sleeping giant " : what great bbq !!! little messier than gas grill takes maybe 20 mins coals white hot - start finish - but what gas grill get temperature up 700 deg !?? talk ultimate broiling ! super easy light - push-button ignites w/ propane 3-5 mins , then wait 15-20 mins go . everyone going want one these !!	1

( husband writing review :) i use my lodge sportsman often possible , but sometimes it still go into storage while . this rugged cover custom fit , i appreciate how much cleaner my grill when i pull it out . keeps dust cobwebs minimum ; keeps rain out if you forget leave it outside . it well worth it if you're going invest grill .	1
i got this grill last year father day gift . i'd never smoked any meat my life but grill-man looong time . this smoker makes it easy . i've ribs , brisquet , pork steaks , chicken . all turned out great , brisquet especially ! make sure you cure inside grill before cooking anything it . there instructions box . also , if your model doesn't come built-in thermometer , make sure you order one char-broil website . using standard oven thermometer wastes time precious heat	1
i bought this grill set my fiance . he absolutely loved them . they heavy extremely sturdy . i would definitely recommend them !	1
my husband loved size , quality heavy weight this product . great male chef family	1
very well made product . i am extremely pleased . heck lot better than cheap cover i got ebay last year very deceptively advertised regarding it durability	1
highly recommed this grill cover . appearance/style classy it subtle colors work well backyard patio . it sooo durable ! i'm sure it last years . no more ugly black vinyl covers you punch holes first time you try drape them over grill . i'll never use anything else besides this artisan grill cover now !!	1
this new line grills everything you could ask grill . high btu output , large cooking surface good looking . i able maintain constant temperatures no problem all . i am very happy this descision	1
i've used my smoker 7 years now i nothing but great things say it . one recomendation drill small hole top insert metal stem thermometer ( $7 ) accurate monitoring smoking . you'll get best results when you hold temps desired levels . it also comes handy checking internal temps meat . after 7 years , heating element broke new ones $40 through char broil . i'm appalled they're so much , am contemplating buying smoker instead .	1
i recently purchased weber gold series grill wanted quality grilling tools complimented stainless steel design grill . i decided this spatula because quality normally associated weber name i not disappointed . spatula handle attractive rubber grip comfort . length spatula great reaching back grill large flanks fish . i would highly recommend this spatula anyone who searching quality accessory their weber grill !	1
it hard better than weber this grill not disappointed two years i owned it . i use it 3-4 times week cooked just everything you imagine it . i am very satisfied its performance , but it few minor flaws . i still my genesis series propane grill still fine after 12 years , but it not big enough so i moved up . pros : stainless doesn't rust . large enough cook substantial amount using indirect method . last night , i simultaneously grilled 4 t-bones , 10 skewers tequila-lime shrimp , sweet peppers , bread . that why i wanted this grill . i need room cook . insulated box holds heat well . first side burner i've actually works . assembly relatively easy . strong rotisserie motor . spin turkey or 3 chickens ; no problem . smoker box w/ its own burner great feature . stainless grates better than any others i used past . lots shelf space w/ fold-down shelves . battery-fired push button starters all burners easy reliable all weather conditions . cons : expensive . but i expect long service life . gas guzzler . more than one tank helpful . couldn't find cover fits it . but it stainless ... gas gauge doesn't work well , but no biggie . bottom cookbox warped little resulting grates loose shifting more than i'd like . occasion when cleaning grates , they fall into bottom cookbox . i work around this probably fix it without too much trouble , but it tick me off . this cost them my 5th star ; i expected better . so i pretty much love this grill it good thing , because i believe i'll it good long while . chad , weird chain door manually lighting grill . it match holder chain attached door so you won't lose it . go figure	1
i think this great product . first one lasted over year it runs 24/7 , even winter	1
i've watching silver while , thinking buy it amazon while it sale . but i finally decided get it local ace hardware store . here why : pirces not significant differrent amazon ace . but ace offered free assembly , free delivery , free gas refill . most important feature me : they allowed me upgrade it stainless steel cooking grates flavorizer bar only $20 extra . ( which $100 value amazon . ) regular grates flovorizer bar , you replace it couple years hard clean . but stainless steel type may last much longer easy maintain . so if you buy it amazon , you pay base price , plus shipping cost , self assembly , gas refill , upgraded cooking grates flavorizer bar etc . choice yours	1
this grill works great really survives elements . it looks brand new even after stormy winter our chicago balcony . i highly recommend it smaller places because shelves fold down out way when not use	1
i impressed looking this grill home depot , even more impressed price amazon.com . using grill , i discovered weber truly better than what i used past . food actually tastes better ! assembly took little longer than 30 minutes given instruction sheet . i little difficulty interpreting pictures , i feel some written instructions would beneficial	1

yourself favor give yourself this gift- beautiful cover great grill . this absolutely nicest grill cover i've ever seen , i've paid 3 times this flimsy ones . i don't agree it too snug , it slipped right over no tugging , looks very neat tailored , but i don't like big billowy ones anyway . excellent deal , prompt shipping .	1
weber grill cover easy use . i would recommend this grill cover anyone wanting protect their weber grill . it fits grill very well easy clean .	1
this product exact replacement original grates . they great , however , if i it again , i could find one , i might gone upgraded quality grate	1
i thought these grates weren't good enough sears meat , boy i wrong . beautiful lines meats got me great reviews my guests . easy clean too	1
great price this unit . saw same one locally $159.00 not color wood i needed . followed directions works great . package new item advertised " nib " . amazon must gotten buy this wood color it cheaper than same units withdifferent wood	1
i bought this item based upon reviews i read i must say it lived up reviews . it job . i bought this late summer but one time i used it i impressed amount bugs it zapped short space time . i saw felt effectiveness product because i stayed backyard longer than usual	1
this my second bug zapper . took brand back didn't work . this zapper working great , that all thanks its intelligent design . some bug zappers super small entry holes , then wimpy little electrodes inside . this zapper designed let bugs fly easily , it vertical electrodes zap bugs . this zapper works really well ... fact other night it zapping like crazy because it hot bugs out . we live urban area near plant nursery , so we'd always bugs coming back door . now this zapper kills them attracts them away our backdoor . great product	1
reviewers who report grille doesn't get hot enough , slightest breeze blows flame out you should need stock up extra gas cannisters , i would point out : this review charcoal model !! once coals fully going mine , nothing short hurricane katrina could blow them out , proper amount charcoal loaded , you all heat you'll ever need . i nothing but praise mine . nice going , weber	1
we pleased our recent purchase . we surprised it came through us mail service . it broken part we believe used cord open umbrella .	1
bought this umbrella last week ( 9/23/05 ) amazon . initially hesitant purchasing it due other reviews describing issue pole two pieces , which , when connected , never straight . all i want add here i not experience this problem . screw mechanism which joins poles seems sturdy , pole appears perfectly straight . i wonder if other people bought umbrellas bad batch or manufacturer redesigned connection mechanism ? ( most recent reviews not mention this problem)re . overall quality , i can't speak how pole or umbrella itself wear over time , but least initially it looks good quality sturdy construction . one thing note despite product description picture making it look like pole made wood , it appears actually made some sort metal which wood coloured ( it still looks like wood though would not look out place wooden patio furniture ) . honest i actually prefer this , since i would imagine it won't discolour easily natural wood should longer lasting . summary , am very pleased my purchase - i would happily recommend it others looking good quality umbrella very reasonable price	1
we ordered umbrella replace one we many years . when product arrived , we surprised quality product such small price . we very satisfied	1
i heard this grill " only " 36000 btu , not hot some other grills . believe me , this puppy plenty hot if all you going cook food ! disregard this btu rating . this btu rating rubbish . this grill transfer so much heat your food so fast if you're not used cooking high-quality grill you turn your beautiful porterhouses into charchol ( i used custom-cut 3-inch porter house break my new grill , my surprise , it closer well than i prefer , but still delicious ! ) everything high-quality . it much more solid than all other grills i looked , grill very even terms heating . besides , it beautiful . side burner not something i really interested , but i just went it . i used it first time . this grill you need	1
i love it ! it bit work maintain , but it awesome grill cooks everything ( once i figured out how cook got good grill cook book ) . i bought two propane cylinders just swap them out when gauge they hang says it quarter tank . it worth price	1
i like this rotisserie quality , ease use , functionality . rotisserie fits my weber performer grill ( which i also like lot ) perfectly , which no surprise since it made specifically weber 22 1/2 inch kettle grill . spit nice chrome finish , forks , appears it last . this my first rotisserie unit , perhaps this might common knowledge , but after using it few times , i found using balancing weight works best first putting your bird or roast spit , then inserting loaded spit ring without weight tightened down or inserted motor , so spit may find its own balance , which naturally its heavy-side down . next , i tighten weight opposite this heavy side , insert it motor , turn it . i then play positioning weight relative spit , but remaining opposite heavy side , so it spins least amount strain motor . ( hope wasn't too wordy . ) anyway , i've cooked chickens , roast , 12 pound turkey ( hoping cook big honkin ' turkey soon ) , all great success . conjunction rotisserie , i've finally discovered canjun injector , hypodermic needle-like flavor injector . using both brings out juicy flavorful foods . one other tip ... carfully open keep box rotisserie came storage . i put some self-stick velcro box ends , it keeps this otherwise awkward store gizmo safe stack-able . i plan buy rotisserie unit my weber gas grill . i don't know why , but addition more succulent outcome food , seeing your food spin around fire adds anticipation meal	1
ring motor what they supposed . ring not fit very well , first , it able rock back forth . however , after little bending into shape , it fit more snug . way ring rests kettle , there alway some gap , which not allow good seal . i not only use this rotisserie , but also give me more room beer chicken . its worth getting it added flexibility .	1
this cover extremely heavy duty survived many windy thunderstorms still good new after year half . it still going strong , still good new	1
this pest repeller works great my attic repelling squirrels . squirrels broken three times gone within 15 minutes . i would not use this inside house because it make constant chirp sound . i can't hear this noise attic , so i buy when this wears out .	1
this solid body storage building exactly advertised . my goal store mower , trimmer , blower , gas miscellaneous items . i build shelf ( not included ) notch it fit install it before putting roof place . it works great gas miscellaneous items leaving room taller items but they must tilted some . if you mower retractable handles ( which i not ) it fit this building . ( so mower still out ) other than it cleared up mess back locks flammables up too . careful read instructions because it would very difficult take pieces apart after clicked into place . if you planning store mower i would recomend larger unit just ease use . this one great lot gardening supplies but i think they should provide least 2 or more shelves	1
protecting your grill important if you leave it outside all time . this far best grill cover we . it easy put over grill , velcro straps keep it flying off , it fits genesis s-320 perfectly , it heavyweight . recommended , definitely	1

this smoker works like charm ! only regret i it bit larger than i expected , i should bought next size down . other than times i used it results great . temperature easy control main concern i wanted sometime i didn't babysit while i smoking my ribs or pork shoulder . others complained receiving units damaged , i guess i lucky , there slight crease one corner but i able straighten it out easily . better packaging would improvement . my . 02 it well worth investment	1

i'm new world smoking , ordered this when i dont feel like doing whole charcoal thing . it works fairly well flavor great , but not quite much you get using charcoal grill . i think it designed placed either side grill ... i've opted slide grates sides place smoker middle ... it seems less smoke escapes grill this way . worthwhile purchase	1
i always recommend oxo line tools anyone lot cooking wants something really designed use . this especially true anyone problems such tendonitis , arthritis , or carpal tunnel -- these tools all designed leverage energy efficiently instead wasting energy most poorly designed utensils . try them out	1
after assembling stand i very pleased my decision purchase this one . i also ordered extension , thinking my mayan family hammock i would need make it longer . but my surprise , hammock fit perfectly without extension , because height stand adjusted pretty high , you could put longer hammock it because this . very heavy steel , well enameled , excellent workmanship very easy assemble . ***** - definitely five star purchase	1
after college i moved back home few months before getting my own place . it totally sitcom setup i lived my mom basement - but mice spiders down there not funny all . i didn't really mind mice running around every now then , but when one got under covers me , i enough . i went local brick mortar store bought all kinds different traps , deterrents , etc try get them out or trap them without harming critters ( mom wouldn't it ) . i bought single two-pack these things immediately after i plugged first one , i saw two mice immediately come out their hiding spot scurry unfinished part basement . one my bedroom one bathroom basement enough me , but mom husband so impressed he bought dozen more rest basement ( lots separate rooms ) garage . definitely read tips suggestions - they only work if there large , open space so put this outlet " full view " room . each room need it own , very large room ( like two-bay garage ) need two or three . we put these up three years ago there hasn't mouse basement since	1

" third - they finally arrived but after their promised delivery time . aside delivery frustrations i am very pleased my purchase would recommend these your backyard . they look great our pool deck	1
this little clock worked exceedingly well first . clear , large display bright enough read but not so bright it distracting night . it takes up little space night table , which great . however , if it your night table you'll angle it so clock face nearly toward wall , you can't adjust projection . if you face clock out toward far wall , projection diplayed upside down . still , i okay this , projection what i interested . worked great until it accidentally got knocked off nightstand onto carpet . one mishap projection broken . nothing could fix it ; you can't even open clock explore mechanics it . without projection , it simply procey bed-side alarm clock . it my fault knocking it over , but i would think clokc this caliber should bit sturdier	1

reference , " old tanks " refer this review weber " quick connect tanks . " first price : i got this home depot $16.95 because i needed grill hurry . if you not opd tank your weber grill see yourself future refilling , you would receive it time before you run out , then i would recommend getting it amazon lesser price but afford shipping time . if you older weber grill wanted tank refilled , then you probably understand frustration i go through get more propane . federal law mandated all tanks now " opd " certified . now , these opd tanks , which detected " star " shape handle , different opening where hose your grill needs connected compared older model . so when i went it refilled , they told me they could no longer refill my old model . so i bought blue rhino . then , i could not connect it my weber grill because different opening . ( propane hose would not adapt tank . ) so i now three options . one buy new grill , which would quite expensive . second , which weber recommended , probably because it would cost me more money , would buying new hose . ( they said it around $40 . i also heard it problem squirrels eating it . ) third this adapter i found . thus , this adapter answer price . connect thread side adapter your hose other side adapter ( this " spring side " or " quick connect " side where release hose adapter , you must just pull back end part adapter . ) picture adapter new tank old hose found here : http://www.homedepot.com/cmc_upload/hdus/en_us/asset/images/eplus/161203_3.jpgi also some advice using product which i hope you may find useful . ( installation instructions quite weak product . ) when installing , there black plastic piece which used screw adapter part . careful when using your crescent wrench not break off part . if you break plastic piece , you probably unable take off adapter tank future . therefore , i would also recommend placing piece safe place so when you need refill , it handy take off adapter . however , if you lose piece , or break it , there one more way it refilled . there adapter which placed old tanks refilling . since this product basically converts your new tank into old one , then you place this refilling adapter product . i know it confusing words , but basically what i am saying you adapter adapter when refilling tank . your refill store most likely this second adapter you when you go refill . ( i get mine pool-mart they usually this handy . ) but just safe side , i would keep plastic piece . but back installation : when you finished screwing it , just connect your hose other side pulling back only part adapter moves , once you push hose end into adapter , push back up only part adapter moves lock hose place . remove hose , simply pull back sliding adapter piece - only part moves . but most likely you didn't need you refilled your old grill sometime last several years . but just case you may needed it . performance , there no leaks , shown soap water test . just pure gas grilling all i now until law passed . but until then , i recommend two things : first buying this adapter , second using common sense install it , not instructions . happy grilling , thanks reading	1

i lot searching review reading internet before finally deciding what buy . i am convinced quick draw ii best value available any make any conpany . features qdii generally found only much higher priced detectors . this thing really works advertised . i already found several coins other things right my own yard . it reliably indicate what coin detected although it many times confuses dimes pennies lcd readout . it very sensitive detects most coin size items very reliably 6 or 8 inches . auto notch discrimination works well filters out most trash items . i used metal detectors ended up aggravating frustrating . this one pleasure use quickly becoming relaxing profitable pastime me . if you want serious metal detector without spending whole lot money give it try ... you won't disappointed ..	1
our old general electric indoor/outdoor thermometer outdoor sensor broke this summer , so it time replace it weather station could give more info weather than just temp . i live south florida , it nice know what heat index , because summer , our temps coast rarely rise above 90 degrees , but heat index rarely below 100 ( which case i choose indoor treadmill over running outside ) . i bought this unit strength prior reviews , which i think pretty darn accurate their overall assessment . i can't present much new information here , but i validate some prior comments . weather station constructed cheap plastic . i think if this station falls off our kitchen bar , where it rests today , it break into smithereens . it'll best hung nail wall or put location where it not going fall ground -- ever . weather station clumsy vertical design small base so i think it'd pretty easy bump into it knock it over . same advice above paragraph applies here , too . weather station emit high-pitched tone when you press button backlight display few seconds . it not big deal me , but some might find annoying . weather station clutzy , non-intuitive method setting display which really call pressing set button up 11 times ! each depression set button selects one area display set , there lot settings displayed ( time , day , date , etc . ) . it pretty easy spend moment setting weather station ( despite clutzy interface ) , because i live eastern time zone , my job made easier because default setting eastern time zone . clock automatically synchronized some atomic clock somewhere , so part worked just fine . accuracy , well , i've it only few days now , but it seems working alright . we've rain last few days , barometric display -- which only shows clouds/rain , partly sunny , sunny -- accurately forecasted cold front drop air pressure . when i put outdoor sensor next indoor sensor ( inside my house ) , readings within few tenths degree each other . humidity readings exactly same . weather station reads . 3 . 7 degrees warmer than my old indoor/outdoor thermometer . i wouldn't know which two digital displays accurate -- my old thermometer or this new weather station . weather station seem lot more jumpy when it comes reading indoor temp . it quick ( when compared my old indoor thermometer ) change reading when , say , air conditioning turns . lunar phase display nice touch . overall , i like this unit so far . i wish it constructed more durable plastic -- my old ge indoor/outdoor unit built thrown against wall without damaged -- i think i'd prefer thermometer reading wasn't quick so jumpy temperature fluctuations . i like humidity readings both indoor outdoor , i especially like heat index calculation . all , i would recommmend this weather station other buyers	1

this my first charcoal grill i say , i bought it because weber reputation so many years best charcoal grill . mentioned , it isn't very big indirect cooking . i cook just my wife me it fine but too small cooking guests . if i could it over again , i'd buy 22 1/2 " grill because it larger cooking area ability add rotisserie attachment . i'm not big rotisserie guy but extention needed cook beer chicken , something i always loved cook gas grills .	1
choosing our first grill really simple decision . we knew we wanted something quality would last us while . weber only way go our minds . now we own this grill i honestly say hardly day goes we don't use it!i'm really glad we opted one touch rather than smokey joe same manufacturer . this grill hook inside cover hang side ash clean up very easy . two us , this grill enough keep us or even guests well entertained . highly recommended	1

this great portable grill size . 14 " one would fine 1-2 people , but not more . this grill handle more charcoal enough room allow 2 heat zones . hardest part finding one ! i finally found one ebay but , you better hurry !	1
though this portable grill , it terrific home use if you're single , or small balcony apartment . it takes very little space , easy maneuver when cleaning time comes . we took ours picnic this weekend grilled two packs hot-dogs once ( 16 thick dogs ) . because grill small , things get hot quick , you need careful easy burn foods should take longer cook . burgers well , steaks fantastic . chicken needs watchful eye . i've used this gem years . my apartments , whole , mandated simplicity efficiency offered up smokey joe . great feature rounded top . this enables better smoking , air smoke circulates more fluidly . downsides : legs aren't sturdy they could . given time , bit bumping around general abuse , screwed legs might turn askew . if you notice this while grill hot , you've problem . solution keep them tight during nonuse . air intake bottom gets clogged ashes . key good charcoal grilling manipulation air flow . intake might open , but stopped up . if you diligent clean ashes , you'll ok . because grill so close ground , you need careful . unlike most weber grill , this one also apt getting kicked over , run into dogs , cars children . i fully recommend weber smokey joe . now , i'm hungry . time stir coals pop few brats . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co	1

after reading tons reviews various mosquito trap technologies , i skeptical this one any different . since price only around $90 i figured it cheapest ' gamble ' out there , so i bought it put it my backyard , which pretty much unusable since june due aggressive mosquito population . sure enough , i emptied hundreds mosquitos out drawer 3 weeks i it installed . my highest total day 50 . my lowest total day 3 when i decided add octenol bait this trap ... which acted repellant far i tell . this trap definitely works better dark when little blue lights show up better . there still mosquitos my backyard , i still get bit . i think mosquito conditions so bad even after catching hundreds them it hasn't significant positive effect yet . one word advice i would like give ... place this trap away any area you want use . i moved it yard my deck brief time , it bad idea . all mosquitos yard my deck suddenly . yikes ! we nearing end mosquito season atlanta cool fall temperatures arrive , so it hard judge what effect removing few hundred mosquitos . i am anxious see how mosquito catcher works next summer during height mosquito frenzy . anyway , if you've wanting something catch mosquitos , but afraid prices , this product positive results without breaking bank	1
first all let me say there some reviews you should ignore , such one here says easygreen sprouter not quality piece equipment ! i'm very fussy consumer i honestly say this outstanding unit very high high quality . you also some google searches you find nothing but raves it what high quality it . worth every penny ! secondly , i'm starting believe everone should grow sprouts get vitamins we not getting food our grocery stores . far " produce " goes our grocery stores , you may well eat boxes they shipped ! over over media these days we hearing them say our soils so depleted first place time we get veggies fruits our grocery bags they lost what little nutritional value they ! even organic stuff questionable time it gets our table , let alone fact some organic farmers not really following practices produce nutritional food . they may not using poisonous sprays but they replentishing soil ? ok- enough ! you find tons info your own . if you want something fantastic yourself your family buy one these sprouters start getting nutrition your body begs you ! ( no i don't work them but wish i designed it ! ) this incredible addition world nutrition heck lot cheaper than buying expensive vitamins your body can't absorb very well . we spent thousands vitamins over years . who really knows what them anyway ? you'll know exactly what your sprouts though . they alive packed everything vitamin pill wished it could but can't!! it so so easy you won't even believe it . it fun ! sprouts outstanding cleanest most vitamin packed foods you ever put your mouth . load up sandwich or toss up salad or throw some smoothie . don't forget brocolli sprouts great !! i use half dropper full 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide each time i fill it water every day . ( one gallon ) this perfectly safe actually helps oxiginate sprouts well prevent mold . i so impressed my easygreen sprouter i ordered three more these ( actually called easygrass sprouters ) purchased wheatgrass juicer so i grow wheatgrass , miracle food . ( check out ann wigmore " sprout book " her book wheatgrass ) i can't say enough easygreen sprouter !! apparently people all over world catching this " fountain youth " piece incredible equipment ! some googling see yourself !	1
i bought this clock specifically time projected ceiling night . my wife i recently got new alarm clocks use backlit lcd rather than led numbers , we found we hard time reading them night . we bought this clock solution . my 4 star rating based use alone . it simply not work during daytime- projector not bright enough complete daylight or bright room lights . that good- light bright enough seen during day would far too bright nigh t-t ime use . you disappointed if you want use this thing during day . i would given this clock much lower rating if i intended use " atomic clock " feature , or use it alarm clock . specifically : 1 . atomic clock only works certain parts country . atomic clock broadcasting station denver , co , further away you get denver , less likely you pick it up . we east coast , our house eastern side large hill , this clock never picked up atomic clock signal , despite following instructions meticulously . while it possible we defective unit , based what i've read i just think we're bad spot , this unit doesn't very good antenna . good news internal clock seems keep fine time . 2 . physical construction very , very cheap . it extremely lightweight , easy knock over . power cord connection flimsy , moving clock ( or knocking it over ) result loss power ( your configuration if you don't batteries installed ) . buttons especially cheap , poorly organized . it works fine our use because we don't need touch it , but it would terrible daily alarm clock- unless you lot more patient than i am bedtime , you would not want try set this thing sleepy state mind . unless you lot more coordinated than i am immediately after waking up , you would knock it off nightstand regularly just trying shut it off . it wouldn't stand up long such abuse . but , i said earlier- if all you need put time ceiling , it works admirably . * update * : after using this thing 3 months , it spontaneously picked up atomic clock signal . i no idea why ( we didn't change * anything *) , but it locked couple weeks . -	1

i just got this grill couple days ago i am psyched ! i've always bit charcoal snob , but i wanted expand my repertoire beyond just weber charcoal grill bradley smoker i . it snap put together it only took me 20-25 minutes . i able lift it onto legs step 3 myself without problem ; you just need careful . i ton research opted weber mostly because my experience their quality products i didn't want chance it semi-unknown brand home depot . i chose genesis gold i don't necessarily like all stainless steel framing genesis platinum line , but i wanted stainless steel grates flavorizer bars genesis silver doesn't . also , i wanted opposed i don't really use side burner . it lights quickly evenly it heat up jiffy ; i like convenience gas . i've also got smoker box grill add smoke i like compensate lack charcoal flavor . however , low slow true barbecue , i'll stick my bradley smoker water vapor propane it burns doesn't allow proper penetration smoke into meat . this grill rocks .	1

i like oregon scientific products , but their previous atomic alarms quirky controls -- often leading changing time zone middle night rather than turning off alarm . this one lots better ! projection feature works ok , though doesn't really focus sharply close distances i'd prefer use . eight minute snooze alarm great -- just right interval ! overall , nice , useful , moderately expensive alarm clock	1

carbon steel like cast iron need seasoned . but once it it very non-stick . easy way season : scrub cookware using green scrub pad scouring powder . rinse well wash regular dishwashing liquid . rinse again . dry 325f oven 20 mins . if you like , cool it bit make it easier handle , but make sure continue next step while cookware still warm touch . coat inside outside cookware good coat vegetable oil -- not so heavy it dripping everywhere , but more than thin coat . course use caution hot cookware . put it few old towels use paper napkin saturated oil coat pan . bake upside down 325f 45min-60mins . you might want put al foil rack below cookware catch any excess oil drips . repeat coating warm cookwarw baking least one more time . third time great . after final coat oil , turn off oven let cookware cool oven . cookware should now darkened subtle sheen . finish rock hard smooth -- not sticky all . treat it well . i use diluted dishwashing detergent scruber clean my cast iron never problem seasoning coming off . just don't let it sit soaking water long time . it still rust . i let some friends borrow my lodge dutch oven campout . they let it soak overnight scraped it clean it didn't dry it out well -- seasoning chipped off . it came back rusted ! so , i just scrub it out remove rust redo seasoning ... it came back almost before , except pitting caused rust -- however , this just cosmetic thing . it still works fine . depending how often you use item , you give it touch up seasoning ... just make sure it clean dry before giving it oil coat baking cooling	1
i ordered this clock , then send it back two times before it finally arrived undamaged ( actually , minimally damaged ) . first two times glass cracked broken . third time , all matter minor dent marks metal frame where packaging must pressed down it ( this only noticeable certain light angles ) . shipping problems weren't manufacturers fault though , amazon packing shipping . it'd nice if they maybe put big " don't stack things top this box " sticker or something box so it didn't get damaged . or , bubble wrap , remember stuff ?! those airbags just ain't cuttin ' it . clock itself , i love it . i kept it despite minor denting b/c it discontinued manufacturer , it largest atomic clock i could find didn't some ugly antique-ish design . second hand actually ticks , instead fluidly moving , which nice touch . it easy set up , it big easy read . it reminds clocks all over my high school ( good way ) . all all , very happy actual clock , very dissatisfied w/ amazon shipping packing it	1
this clock works great ! it automatically picks up accurate time through radiowave . it not come product manual but easy figure out . all you selct your time zone button ( pt , mt , ct , et ) put new aa battery . i agree review which mentioned this clock not made durable construction . matter fact , when i picked up clock package , tiny screw came off . it one screws hold back body panel main body . it not affected function well visual part , anyway , so it may not big deal . overall , this clock good enough price	1

i've using metal detectors around 5 years now . my first detector bounty hunter quickdraw ii , very fine , easy learn detector that real workhorse . i learned most everything i know metal detecting personal experience reading lots posts asking lots questions bounty hunter forum http://www.detecting.com i shopped around found bounty hunter land ranger factory shipped model ( no extras except 4 " 8 " coil ) $337 . price , i couldn't afford not buy it ! when land ranger ( lr ) arrived , it 3 pieces extremely easy assemble . manual comes lr gives you basic information you need get started detecting lr , but bit general when it comes explaining what each functions . if you just want " turn go " detector , land ranger may not you . if this case , i would recommend getting easier learn detector such bounty hunter quickdraw ii or even bounty hunter tracker iv . should you later decide get land ranger , your first detector make excellent back-up detector great detector friend or family use you . what i would recommend going bounty hunter forum website listed above learn , way more , information various detectors their various functions than i could ever begin explain here . even though i detecting while , my first trip out land ranger quite overwhelming somewhat frustrating due much greater sensitivity this model , added features it information overload tones responding mineralized ground conditions , trashy areas ( many pulltabs , screwcaps etc . ) condition know " falsing " ( tones due mostly incorrect " sensitivity " settings improper ground balancing ) . initial experience i describe here very common first time land ranger users frustrating , but get much better practice more one learns detecting general land ranger particular . i use land ranger now , i learned much settings , what ignore what watch indicate which targets may worth digging . once past information overload ( happen , i assure you ) , user begin appreciate sensitivity this detector , learn proper settings , begin finding more more valuable items ( or targets they called ) become one this detector . i purchased bounty hunter land ranger it very sophisticated microprocessor features including - target id , vdi ( numeric ) readout indicating target conductivity , 3 tone id , it automatic manual ground balancing , programmable target accept/ reject , all metals , no motion/ pinpoint mode , self tuning ( motion ) all metals mode ( good deep hunting relics , caches and/or gold nugget shooting ) ... ... reputation bounty hunter detectors ... but mainly excellent price such full featured , professional metal detector . i love able put this baby work discriminating out trash items while ringing sharp clear when locating coins jewelry . land ranger also ideal hunting relics ( gold ) nugget shooting , although i not much either these yet ( soon , i hope ) . i also love fact two coils ( standard 8 " 4 " nugget coil ) come stock land ranger i also 10 " coil i purchased around $60 . ( it important several coil sizes available various types hunting ) price additional coils many other brands detectors astronomical , so this integral part my decision get bounty hunter rather than some other brands . i love how lightweight this detector . i love knowing i sophisticated detector not miss items buried deep . ( how deep depends size object , type metal , soil conditions etc ) generally , lr detect depth around 10 " -12 " deep coin sized target . ( believe me , you won't want dig too many objects deep , most targets right around 4 " -6 " deep , due how coins , jewelry etc . tend migrate down into soil , this varies , course , but general , greater number objects somewhere this depth range . what i hate land ranger parts manual give very general description certain features like ground monitor meter or self tuning all metals mode . i wish land ranger waterproof or least water resistant ... it not , i highly recommend you not use it rain without good plastic cover fits securely around control housing . conclusion : i highly recommend land ranger any seasoned detectorist ... or novice detectorist willing devote good deal time fair amount patience mastering many nuances this full featured detector . land ranger hosts target id , ( vdi ) numeric readout , 3 tone id , depth meter , battery meter , ground monitor meter , sensitivity meter target indicator . it touchpad controls sensitivity , accept/ reject discrimination , all metals - no motion/ pinpoint mode , 3 factory preset modes , all metals ( motion ) self tuning mode smart trac automatic manual ground balancing . it handful , but great full featured unit very reasonable price . 5 stars ... highly recommended if you willing devote some time patience learning it traits harnessing it potential , once you , you'll absolutely love it , i know i ! recommendedyes	1

my story this : got some mice house start winter . little poops all over , chewed cereal bars closet/cupboard , mice trash etc . laid out traps caught four them but still : little poops all over , chewed cereal bars closet/cupboard , mice trash etc . so i brought two these units . first i put them both basement where i actually seen little critters ( i pretty big house ) i didn't see any evidence them basement after two days or so but upstairs it still : little poops all over , chewed cereal bars closet/cupboard , mice trash etc . so i moved " pest repellers " upstairs put all my food items plastic containers . i saw some evidence mouse trash first morning but since then , nothing . i don't know if it me storing food better , pest repellers or both but i seen nothing . i moving these things around house every other day or so they seem work me . i would give unit five stars but they one draw back , they make noise . if you expect these things quiet your trouble , they chirp . it not too loud doesn't bother our dog or us but it make noise . me chirping small price pay get rid mice .	1

i searched long time cushion fit old lounge chair which slightly larger measurements new cushions most stores today . horray !!!!!!!!!! this one perfect served me well comfort weather resistance . it unusually rainy month may cushion justs dries little or no wiping . so comfortable too	1
previous reviewer complained metallic taste when using this item . it should noted nowhere package user told seasoning must before it should used . i lots cast iron utensils pans so i well aware fact . i don't use oil it give off unpleasant odor if not completely absorbed into metal . i use melted shortening instead . far grill press itself goes , i couldn't happier it . i used it steven raichlen tuscan grill it produced very distinctive flavorful grill marks steak . it great grilling butterflied chicken too . fact , it so good chicken i might second one ! if you feel grilled food should not only taste great but look appetizing too , give this try . you'll look like barbecue guru !	1

we enjoyed able just open our eyes look ceiling above us know what time night it	1
i bought this my weber because cover designed just didn't cut it . it too small i didn't like fact it didn't cover stand or utensils i hanging grill . while this cover bit big , it covers grill , stand tank just fine . i think heavy duty weight just fine windy frigid chicago winter .	1
we purchased this roaster my father . he made excellent chicken it last weekend . it provides nice sturdy base set your chicken allows you add veggies , beer , wine , etc very easily . i very impressed how it held chicken ease removing chicken once cooking . we very cheep " beer-in-the-butt " holder weber roaster much more stable easy use . i not give it 5 stars because it set chicken so high , lid my fathers weber charcoal grill would not fit . however , he able rig smaller grill rack sit lower grill it cooked fine . we great chicken	1

my husband checks this gadget all time . most part , it right . he likes it that main thing . thanks	1
weber grill always cadilac bbq grilling . it quality good - it won't rust last decade even when left outdoors . its other claim fame ability it offers " shut off charcoal " it air tight . " one touch " system just makes it even easier . instead close three bottom vents seperately ( fumbling hot surfaces cannot easily seen ) , you just flip one lever . you make up your mind yourself silver vs . gold models both good . what size you need ? what you want cook ? turkey ? - better get 22 1/2 inch size . if you chicken or roast mind , 18 1/2 inch it save you some fuel boot	1
this works very well chicken ribs well	1
weber smokey joe grill real performer . we so pleased we purchased one these . we cook lot grill weather permitting . smokey joe grill fires up quick . smokey joe grill also cooks up burgers , hotdogs steaks evenly short order perfection . i really mean it . we love it . food ready no time . smokey joe grill really efficient unit quite innocuous appearance . it quite mobile seems fit anywhere use or storage . it actually quite amazing . we noticed we use less charcoal , lighter fluid , save time , get better tasting food save time cleanup . we own two depending how much we going cook . smaller units perfect two people or third or even forth if somebody happens stop .	1
item showed up nearly week before i expecting it . due its weight , free shipping added plus . delivery company actually placed grill inside my garage which very helpful again due its weight size boxes . directions provided assemble grill vague very difficult interupt . directions indicated plan 30 40 minutes assemble . it took almost 2 hours i am very mechanically inclined . once assembled grill worked perfectly . if i it over again , i would buy this grill , but would love better directions	1
i love taste charcoal cooked food when i saw this grill store i it . i've b-b-qing it seven years totally love i t.t hree friends saw it bought one also	1
very nice product but smaller than i thought it would . wish write up dimensions i unsure size . would liked it bigger .	1
i bought ( apparently identical ) charbroil lowe my son , because it rated so highly consumer . i opportunity cook it twice , very impressed -- very even ; very controllable . so , i bought one myself amazon , am still impressed . i think reviewer who commented bad packing may received received return . packing mine good , everything plastic bagged ; no scratches , finish looked ok . assembly not light-hearted , but biggest problem assembly instruction sheet . not very clear , uses " beside " where it should say " inside " ; makes no mention until 3/4 way through there different lengths screw , not differentiate regular sheet metal screws . however , i no real problem , but assembly take 1 1/2 - 2 hours . i thought construction quite good . certainly nothing much stronger or heavier than it needs , but this means grill no heavier than it needs ! when assembled everything feels very solid . i take wheels off reinstall them after completing frame so i could tighten all screws when frame fully assembled squared . probably not necessary , but it only added 30 seconds . next time i would delay installing wheels few steps . i give five stars because i not know grill this price range large , so many features , cooks so well	1
i 4 more atomic clocks ( 2 more analogue 2 digital ones ) well 3 atomic watches . self setting function works exactly same all them . so i think it worth setting expectations straight how this clock most likely work you . unless you live close colorado ( where time signal originates ) proper way ' setting ' this clock put battery wait overnight clock set itself . best signal reception depends where you live also time year weather conditions . charlotte , nc where i live - most my atomic clocks watches sync themselves around 2 am . i guess it bit confusing people unfamiliar ' atomic ' technology see hands clock start moving around then stopping some random hour if though clock broken ... la crosse ( other makers ) should probably include ' quick start ' card states big bold letters put battery , select your time zone , ignore any hand movement ( or lack there ) then wait overnight . again - unless you live close enough co so clock receive time signal any time day or night - you wait until next day . i've this clock around 6 months now it worked perfectly well ( within 1 second actual time ) exception couple bizarre quirks . one time clock got itself off 15 minutes ( though seconds hand dead ) . i not adjust it - next day it fixed itself through its usual overnight self-setting . time it spontaneously changed time zones started showing california time . this time around i remove battery , reinsert it re-select time zone ( simply re-selecting time zone not solve problem ) . reviewer remarked - clock looks nicer ' person ' than it photos . very thin rim makes dial look bit bigger than stated dimensions would suggest . face color off-white or very light cream looks very nice . build quality - it nothing special . clock 100% plastic ( even ' crystal ' ) except dial which simply paper . whole thing - including mechanism - made china . even though clock probably extremely cheap manufacture ( given its all plastic construction ) it not look ' cheap ' once it hangs wall . i bought virtually identical quality atomic clock seven bux ( delivered ) everybody favorite auction site it looks ok - but not nice this one ( different ' brand ' - not la crosse ) . one star taken off ' quirks ' - but not ' good enough ' materials engineering ( it would better if it made less cheaply - but it looks fine way it ) . michae	1
there plenty detailed reviews both pro con so i keep mine brief . i just want chime pro side . $185.00 incl . shipping i paid amazon it well worth price . now , if i paying closer four or five hundred i would go davis . but , again , price i am plenty pleased . p.s. sure download radio shack manual . it must	1

i very pleased my hammock chair this past summer . pillow real bonus . my kids i hang out yard hours	1
i like this clock . this night stand alarm clock . it what it supposed very well once it set up . set up not intuitive so you read manual exactly it says . but it not really hard set up it just not easy . you think what you doing . way manual large reviewer commented but it because instructions several languages not because it so complicated . reason i'm giving it 4 stars instead 5 stars plug which ac adapter plugs into , which allows it project time continually , too much space either side . result you think ac adapter plugged up properly when fact adapter gone down either side plug . it took me while figure out what going . first i thought clock defective some other reviewers . that bad design flaw needs fixed . fyi it doesn't project time continually battery mode because would quickly drain batteries . battery mode it only projects time 3 or 4 seconds when you press snooze button . once clock set up your time zone you never set time again , not even daylight savings time , you always correct time . clock built antenna picks up radio signal official u . . government time keeper . once day it sets itself according radio signal . it also sensors tell you indoor humidity temperature .	1
we 7 month old lab who loves it . its only toy we tried he can't chew through . he chews through almost anything ( tennis toughies , raw hide bones , etc etc ) . he it 3 weeks still fascinated it he day one .	1

let face it , if you going spend over 1000 dollars grill , you need one very good grill cover this fits bill perfectly . not only it protect grill sheen surfaces , it actually hugs grill grill shape still looks attractive , even cover . also , we can't let anyone forget grill cover made weber ( best grill company earth ) so , it good sized logo cover everyone uber-jealous ! all-in-all , must-have summit 625 summit 650 grills	1
but ... it ideal us ... we going get mosquito magnet ( which lots our family/friends/etc ... ) , but then saw not only you spend money up front but buy all kinds things years keep it going ... so we figured we would start this then if it didn't work we would move ... love technology description website this etc ... when we hooked it up it seemed work instantly ... who knows weather didn't change or different soap we using , etc ..??? but one night we sitting getting eaten alive mosquitoes next we plugged it we weren't .... so .... we weren't going unplug it find out ! esp . our three little kids protect them ! it would 5 if we never got bitten	1
i bought it first like 4 months ago . i bought it again twice send present . great performance good price . i highly recomend it . you don't turn lights see what time it ..	1

works great ; i checked accuracy +/- 2 degrees . pretty good 10 bucks . i use it my japanese soaking tub set temp it accurat	1
first thing i noticed big kahuna quality construction . after simple assembly process taking 10 minutes ; i fired it up amazed how powereful burner . average home stove burners produce 9,000 14,000 btus -- big boy produces up 65,000 btus ( according eastman ) . if doesn't get your wok turn red hot then nothing short jet engine . subject woks ; i didn't buy one eastman i'm glad i didn't . i'm sure eastman woks top quality but i very good reason my statement . lodge makes iron wok not only less expensive but also fits into big kanuna like key lock ( minor modifications burner rack ) . base lodge pro-logic 14-inch cast-iron wok loop handles not only works great big kahuna but it also sits nicely your stove thanks it flat bottom . ok , world isn't perfect so lodge wok didn't fit into big kahuna grill out box . order make it fit , i filed down four cross members grill 1/8 " each side now it fits like glove . this huge advantage over curved bottom wok because wok simply can't move much safer use ( considering high temperature cooking surfaces this big plus ) . let face it : nobody wants hold their wok place while cooking if this avoided . i also recommend you get eastman stainless wok spatula ( also amazon ) -- it almost requiremen t.t he only thing i would change big kahuna would add electronic ignition . i'll probably add one myself using outdoor grill parts . keep mind big kahuna , wok spatula lodge wok all available amazon which means free super-saver shipping available amazon -- resulting considerable savings these heavy items . you could easily pay twice much elsewhere .	1
this works well . easy use quite affordable . it would perfect if it clock well , but temperature humidity readings it works great	1
i've several wireless atomic weather stations they all looked somewhat cheesy obvious spot , so you find yourself tempted hide it away this course defeats its original purpose . lacrosse model matches our kitchen cabinets wonderfully functional .	1
my weber purchased 2001 served me well . grill never covered i live within 1/4 mile beach . eventually elements corroded original burner , especially small cross-over tube . installation much easier than i thought ( 15 minutes ) no special tools needed . now grill griller happy again . less than $50 i've extended life my $550 grill least 2-4 years	1

i purchased this stainless grate set replacement my 15 year old weber genesis 1 gas grill ... my only regret not making switch stainless sooner . this grill mainstay my grilling many years now rather than buy new grill , i chose completely rebuild my grill - starting burners finishing grates . amazon.com extremely fast fulfilling my order ( free shipping me ended up product my door step 3 days !!! ) . take my word it , not but cheaper enamel grates - you get what you pay . my 15 year old grill " good go " 15+ years	1

i just received my two chairs ! i just placed order two more ! i ton research patio lounge chairs - pricing , quality etc . these chairs stand head toe restoration hardware , crate barrel , pottery barn . they perfect weight .. not too heavy , not too ligh t.t hey look very expensive . wow - sometimes i think these review written manufacturer because they so glowing times .. but i am just customer so pleased i got these they this great . i prepared spend $555 per chair restoration hardware .. but i got two less than price one . only other thing i would add though .. cushions not fantastic . i am thinking ordering more comfortable ones all money i saved	1
this unit works well . 90 foot max range direct line sight . walls obstructions reduce this distance significantly . oregon scientific makes number main units remote sensors . they not all work together . check their web site which remotes work which main units before you buy : http://www2.oregonscientific.com/service/sensors/default.asp .	1
this nice addition anyone patio . product came very well packaged heavy duty double boxes legs wrapped padded paper . assembly took around 30 minutes . others commented holes don't line up naturally require some " finessing " order get lined up , but really wasn't difficult overcome . all required assembly 4mm allen wrench which provided ( although end started get worn 1/2 way through assembly required me use wrench ) . probably one nicest features table adjustable levelers legs . this seems like good quality i am confident last many years come	1
when researching metal detectors before buying bounty hunter tracker iv christmas gift , i learned using earphones detector not only makes hearing " beeps " much easier , but also extends battery life battery detector . we live windy , windy canyon area , so i knew earphones necessity because constant wind noise . my husband says earphones effectively screen out noise would overpower emissions detector if he weren't wearing headset . he happy camper his bounty hunter tracker iv bounty hunter stereo earphones	1
we're happy this sensor . it works great . we're little worried it holding up when it goes outside , but info it says it fine . i'd buy it again	1
i this unit 2 years . i replace wind sensor under warrantee but other than , i very happy unit . wireless tranmission sensors base unit doesn't happen quickly enough . direct wire connection updates every 8 seconds . if you buy this unit , plan run wire sensor base . if i it again , i would buy this unit . under $200 , you can't get more data . one note - humidity range only 20% - 95% . when it rains , humidity really 100% but registers 95	1

this clock best !!!! we only use following features never change settings : time : projected ceiling . outdoor temperature : projected ceiling . weather : projected ceiling . it so perfect roll over night see time ceiling large numerals ...... without squinting looking our glasses !!! older folks usually trouble reading clock during night without aid their glasses ...... not this clock	1
this seems like great idea - food held basket , so you don't shove skewer through meat . however , little bolts hold down clamp onto rack meant tightened hand . if you sizable chicken , you cannot tighten these enough hand . i chicken fall out rack into flames more than once . then you tighten them pliers , but metal so soft you only this 2 or 3 times , then threads stripped whole thing useless ! again : hand tighten = chicken falls out ; tighten pliers = threads stripped . now i try get replacement parts rotisserie weber . good luck	1
photo amazon isn't representative product i received . frame white , or extremely light silver . i also bought lacrosse technology wt-3122a 12-inch wood atomic analog clock , which didn't match it photo either , but least i like it .	1
don't waste your money ( even just 10 bucks ) . plastic not rip-stop tears very easily . i now just use big , heavy duty , black trash liner - they much stronger	1
$80 this ? seriously overpriced . if you find something cheaper buy it , this not worth 80 bucks . clamps not capable holding small boneless ham without slipping . worked well ribs	1
me , lacrosse technology wt-3122a 12-inch wood atomic analog clock little value . i talked friend living colorado who very satisfied equivalent clock , but i am new york much further away transmitter it just doesn't work my satisfaction . when it first put wall kitchen didn't work several days , i contacted technical support . they suggested i put clock window . i followed their suggestion after 2 days clock set correctly . i moved it back kitchen wall now 7 days after change daylight savings it still eastern standard time . i didn't purchase this clock hang my window . i need clock kitchen . soon i find suitable replacement this one going into garbage where it belongs	-1
this seemed like pretty slick idea , pretty clock . all it needs let us know our stomachs aren't lying , it really near lunch . i set it near our front ( glass ) door it apparently found signal it changed time itself spot . so i hung it our office ( no window ) . two days latter we thunderstorm one night . apparently interfere signal . rather than sit tight wait fresh signal , this thing off odd amount time , like hour 27 min next morning . i set it manually , today it off again hour . instructions reset which i got tech support not less than 7 steps long included detailed disertation what type battery , what it expiration should . man , that lot work just verify what my stomach knows true . $25 , packaging gone , this dumpster . i'll get regular clock only keeps time couple minutes month .... but takes month show error	1

while clock works quite well resets it should , wireless outdoor thermometer way off . i base this two other wireless brands i own , acu-rite oregon scientific , local noaa weather broadcast , also wfie tv . acu-rite temp = 18.2 , oregon scientific+ 18.5 , noaa broadcast temp @ 20:09 jan28/07 = 18f , local tv station wfie-tv = 18f . [ ... ] i write this , weather channel also reports it 18 degrees 20:30 . la crosse ws-8256u-al reports it 23.5 , more than 5 degrees off . my opinion , clock/thermometer costing this much should dead . buy it time , not temperature	-1

i bought this thing put it my garage month . one night i saw mouse running across my stove so i brought it put it directly stovetop . later evening i washing dishes , mouse ran back forth behind my microwave his little cheeks full shake'n'bake right past rodent repellant five times !!	-1
repeller works fine repelling , but when " rodent " setting it makes audible chirping noise that annoying so it used only remote locations where people don't normally go . reason we bought this model because it run batteries we wanted it outer shed , but manual says it'll only run two or three days battery power , making it absolutely worthless this use	1
i disappointed these tongs , which surprising since oxo makes good kitchen utensils . i agree other reviewers , it difficult grasp close them . unless you rather large hand ( which i don't ) , you're forced grasp handle so far down near stainless steel ! when comparing these my 12 " tongs my hand grasp same point - which really made these 16 " tongs no different 12 " ones .	-1
good news it mostly works -- although weather forecast , advertised , only 75% accurate . unfortunately , it some annoying flaws . 1 ) although it provide either 12 or 24 hr format either celsius or fahrenheit temps , you can't actually select temperature display -- once you select 24-hr time format , you get celsius temps whether you want them or not . if you want deg , you must select 12-hr time . 2 ) if you run clock off batteries , you press button get any projection . unfortunately button you press snooze button , which activates both projection backlight ; button control brightness projection not work battery mode ; activating both lights simulaneously both redundant wasteful , it runs down batteries more rapidly than necessary . 3 ) worst all , device emits very annoying , very audible , high-pitched whining sound any time any button pressed ( including snooze ) anytime you need set or reset anything . 4 ) manual confusing ; information website not tell me anything i needed know . emailed support -- no acknowledgement , although i eventually got response it wasn't remotely helpful , i already given up them returned device	1
this product waste money . mice my room completely unaffected , walk right device without any sign concern . besides ineffective , devices themselves make slight buzzing sound ( not silent advertised ) . i now buy set ( humane ) mousetraps , i recommend anyone reading this same save themselves $40	-1
my smoker arrived dented chipped , which i wasn't happy but i could live -- i don't expect relatively inexpensive outdoor oven maintain its new look after some wear tear anyways . however , rails sides hold shelves not welded together well . fact , two rails arrived completely broken off ( opposite sides different levels ) third tenuously held place single weld . i thought broken-off rails parts used oven assembly ; otherwise , i would not unboxed smoker put it together . i would returned it . because i assembled unit before realizing it broken , i thought replacing broken parts would easier than disassembling unit , re-crating returning it . i called distributor three weeks ago order replacement parts not yet arrived . i've already waited longer than distributor indicated i would before receiving parts . if alternative gas-fueled smokers didn't cost multiple what this costs , i'd really angry . hands down , this most unsatisfactory purchase i've made amazon . spite impairment not fully functioning smoker , i seasoned it used it once . chicken i made promising . ( my hope my experience this smoker improve lets me award rating 2 stars based this one use . ) if i ever get parts i need , i think smoker adequate initial experimentation this kind cooking . if i like results , i'll replace this smoker better one	1

i live apt nyc , so roaches very common problem . after long battle i finally got rid roaches my place , but i cannot escape bugs visiting other apartments . i thought this device could help problem . also , i don't like use spray too often or all baits , gels , other poisons around , so i decided try these things . unfortunately , they don't work . first week i bought them i saw big roach crawl under door walk directly under repeller straight dining room . ultrasonic frequency nothing it . instead this repeller i use limonel ( orange peel oil ) safe alternative use when children present , it repell kill bugs . so , how get rid roaches ? seal every crack nook cranny expansive foam , wood sealer , etc . mine came through bathroom kitchen vents , so i put mosquito screens block their way , also i sealed gaps wall electrical outlets apt silicone i bought plastic stripe closes gap door floor . also , my husband sprays once every 4 months repellent . good luck	-1

chair good back support fits 6 ft tall man well even little extra wood support head . my stool arrived wood split so check it before driver takes off if you . mind instructions when you putting it together . if you don't watch bolts small blurry print step step notes you get turned around . also , wood almost orange it color	1
very disappointed this item . only two eight lights work they only stay hour . there plenty sunshine here new mexico charge them up but they still don't work just plain worthless	-1
this basket not stainless steel advertised . it merely chrome plated . i returned it immediately dinged return shipping costs other miscellaneous fees ' error not our fault ' . amazon continuing advertise this item something it not despite alerted discrepancy other consumers . i believe qualifies this error entirely their fault . this not level customer service i come expect rely upon my dealings amazon	-1
well , hansen gas-mate ii quick disconnect adapter temporarily solve your bbq connection issues , but only temporarily . what inevitably happen you suffering my fate . upon emptying your tank , you going find someday you this adapter stuck threads tank . there no place grab adapter wrench or pliers get good grip it turn it . save little plastic inner piece comes it you get adjustable wrench around square outside turn adapter out while , until day comes when torque required too much plastic inner piece . i would also recommend greasing up both sets threads , ones new tank ones hansen gas-mate ii adapter . don't overtighten it putting it into your new full tank . this adapter bad design weber . this adapter should come either strong metal inner piece helps you remove it , or it should some portion adapter itself its outside operates like nut serves grabbing point wrench	-1
bbq mitt lots mold it awful smell . box , paper all smelled bad . amazon quick accept return no return shipping charges . amazon great usual , but they need drop this product	-1
look my other reviews other meat tenderizers made lot better than this one would more worth your while . i say it flimsy because it so skinny . other ones wider base offers more stability when you're stabbing into cuts meat . this smaller one also means you stab meat lot more . i say just get larger one that more stable takes less effort	-1
i grill year round many weather conditions . unlike gold platinum grills , silver grill not carry handle keep it shut transport ( see review burnt down car ) , nor it ability prop lid wind/rain shield . silver grill works fine nice weather fast , hot cooking , but if you want grill drizzle or little wind , ability prop lid up ( available gold platinum models ) essential . i lost my gold grill . last night i tried cooking little rain silver grill , it wasn't up task like my gold grill . i'm going buy gold or platinum grill this time	1
this item came me much i tried , only way i could view numerals ceiling see them upside down . there no way turn unit so it would project so i could read it my bed . i tried placing it both sides bed but didn't work either . it seemed me , guts unit placed wrong . there only one way move projector . so , i cannot recommend this item . i sent it back	-1

i " ez-up " 10x10 ' shelter my back yard , when one crossbar broke , it broke 2 others . if anyone sitting chair my back yard , they'd become shishcabob cheap thin metal used make these canopies . although ez-up sells products their web site facilitate holding these canopies down wind , they not cover any " wind or rain damage , " although this , my view , not factor why frame failed , company first response when i called get return authorization after it failed only after 8 months use , they quickly stated " we don't cover wind or rain damage , cut me off , apparently no reguard anyone safety , stating if it raining or even slightest wind ( i think it failed around 2 mph " winds " ) , their " warantee " not cover it ! they said i could send it they would determine ( after paying outrageous sum money send it back ) if they might replace it , but they likely would not . people company rude , no concern their product some safety issues , so i'm looking buy something less expensive , lasts longer ! interesting , they told me they don't cover any wond or rain " damage " , yet they also sell hold-downs it states their web site ( apparently directions i never received mine ) not fold it up if it wet , but leave it up ! i much less expensive shade latested much longer i'd recommend others same , or buy industrial model clearly stated their warantee product withstand wind up " " mph it made withstand rain well . after my experience this company product , their staff returns dept ., i would avoid ever buying one these again ! i received mine gift ( cost my friend over $200 ! )there much better , sturdier , safer canopies out there . if i could give this product zero or negative score , i would ! these canopies not nearly sturdy i recall them years ago ( or perhaps brand ? ) i expect these canopies recalled time due safety issues . i would strongly recommend buying something less expensive sturdier	-1
year ago we bought performance series very happy it until week ago when upon lighting it fire spread out pit area melted controls . char broil unconcerned indicated not sell replacement parts . no comments whatsoever safety . it seems replaceing grill yearly basis expected charbroil . past we used weber got ten years grill . i would look weber	-1
i recently bought stinger uv15 . it worked well one month ! month i followed recommendations cleaning it keeping it clear dead bugs . well just shy one month grid completely failed so it attracts bugs , but doesn't kill them . this product not worth money	-1
my second one now ... not i liked it much first time , just it only brand they sell local store here . i say while it worked , it worked ... i mean , it killed some bugs ! these , however , my problems it : bulbs burn out fast ! like after four six months ... replacement bulbs almost much i paid whole unit ! thing gets jammed up bugs there no easy way clean it . finally , it doesn't appear very weatherproof . first one died after storm one i now just died . i think i am buying different brand here ... one works more than few months	1
i one other weather station la crosse seems work ok , but this thing paperweight far i am concerned . it shows it raining out when sun out ! it constantly losses contact remote sensor temp humidity seems always off . i attempted contact la crosse , but other reviewers said , lost cause . they never answer any emails regarding product help or issues , no one seems answer their phone either . maybe i lemon , but i feel what they charge their products , la crosse should more responsive their customers	-1
i purchased this cushion thinking it would comfortable durable . when you lay cushion it rough abrasive . if any water gets it it stains immediately stain not disappear when it drys . i am very dissatisfied cushion would not purchase one agai	-1
i bought wmr968 2/10/2005 today , 2/14/2007 , only indoor baro-therm-hygro still works . anemometer replaced under warrenty 11/2005 . this service took 2 months complete oregon sci . anemometer then quit 12/2006 oregon sci . said tough luck it out warranty . thermo-hygro quit 2/2007 once again , tough luck . my thoughts unit besides it not functioning after 2 years : cheap cheaper . manual nearly worthless . anemometer accurate 60 kts . then gets wildly optimistic . temp ., humidity , baro seem accurate . rain gauge kinda funky way it reports because delay built resolution but it useable . all failures i i think related water intrusion into sending units . everone green corrosion pc boards when taken down rooftop . sealing units very poor use phone cords very cheap . i just got off phone , again , oregon sci . juan customer service told me " we can't help you " . if you want weather station made cheaply , no customer support last less then 2 years buy wmr968 . i guess price compared professional weather stations this thing attarct lot people but buyer beware	-1
i spent several months 5 purchases trying find good set tongs my husband who pickiest " bbq expert " ... these one worst . not buy them . locking mechanism clunky . they not open close smoothly . oxo 16 inch tongs much better lighter . you want tongs hinge vs ones permanently open waiting you squeeze them around what you trying pick up . good luck . i send these back	-1
i bought this clock expecting it : show humidity room ; show temperature ; set itself daylight savings . it neither above . temperature stays 60 humidity measure it always way off . same room i alarm clock all above accurately . clock attractive easy read it keeps time ok . but it should more . i am very disappointed	1
okay here my indepth review . i little flies some sort my hydroponic vegie greenhouse . i bought this seemingly easy little hunk plastic make sound that only bothersome little animalsand bugs hear . 4 days after purchase little guys seem flying ultrasound . jig bop back forth like they dancing .... i bet they dancing , making love reproducing ultrasonic waves ! i killed more bugs inhaling while plugging this my green house . rather then take it back i suggest you huck it black decker exec robbing us telling us this thing works . box they site study but don't show it reference . when i called bd they said , " we don't know what study info came " . they hornswaggling us ! this gonna big like enron ! corporate karma ! update- 7 days later . i really wanted give this product chance i'm lazy beyond belief plugging stuff right up my alley . if i go buy lady bugs or pest spray i'm gonna pissed . soooooooooooo i bought 4 more plugged them all 3 more days my small greenhouse ...... not damn thing happened . actually i think it works like rave extascy flies . there more them now they seem much more fun ! so conclusion , this thing sucks more then suckiest thing ever sucked suck . only buy it if you need some extra plastic hanging your outlets .	-1
i purchased two cushions use small chairs . when cushions i arrived , i could hardly believe how small they , smaller than description stated . addition small size , cushions lot stuffing seemed more like volleyballs than chair cushions .	-1
name this item should " pillow " . it much too small cushion . they need change discription pillow or cushion your head . i wish i spent more time reading whole page this item before i ordered it . lesson learned	-1

i am sorry i bought this thing . it way too complicated set up , yes , i read instructions ... they only added my frustration . i would not recommend this product all think 3 times before purchasing anything else this manufacturer	-1
product promises good results , but instruction manual very unfriendly confusing -- printed such small fonts one needs magnifying glass read it third hand execute steps indicated . unfortunately , average customer , i only two hands . after several attempts , i still not able make display light up permanently onto ceiling . i look forward resolving , but problem you need combination obscurity room view display ceiling , but light instruction manual read it	-1
i bought this january it worked beautifully until daylight savings time came around . now it hour off ( one hour less than it should ) won't reset daylight savings time . there button resets it if you don't daylight savings time but it dosent anything either . removed reinserted battery following instructions endlessly but it stuck hour short until fall . no reply manufacturer . beautiful clock but useless half year	-1
sounds like great item , but since i never received it . i not give it honest review	-1

warmth window affects thermometer ! d'oh! it totally inaccurate single-pane glazing , very inaccurate dual-pane glazing , still slightly inaccurate when mounted jerri-rigged 6 " extender dual-pane glass . nature windows big source heat loss means this thermometer measuring * warm * ambient air , not actual outside temperature	-1
amazon.com usually ships this within 24 hours ? it over week , item still supposedly stock , it still hasn't shipped . it great product , but buy it elsewhere	-1

what joke , not worth money . i put it container pull out oil it dies half way through . swapped batteries , pulled it out , washed it looked all parts . it either used resold me amazon , or it defective start . since they 30 day return policy , i am now stuck it , i see what eastman says next . very disappointing , i go back old way just pouring it into funnel coffee filter it	-1
following quote direct oregon scientific wrong : " illuminated blue back-light means you never fumble around dark , lcd automatically adjust light room , so you read it when you need . " we keep our clock accross our bed , led not readable , there we couldn't reach it press light button ( which only lasts 8 seconds ) . i took it into completely dark closet led not light up all ; clock could not read without pushing light button . apparently there no way keep backlight . unless you intend keep this clock within reach so you press button turn light ( which only lasts 8 seconds ) , you don't mind not able see led across room , this might not good choice . i returned mine due above deceptive product description . regarding projection : temp reading larger than time ( which doesn't make sense ) , image only few inches tall within readable focus ; also , it doesn't show up clearly textured walls	1
item this picture not item i received . when you buy picture , make sure you prepared disappointed . frame stand very thin , not wide shown , screws seen attach stand , bottom bowl seen also . bowl concrete filler , complete circle bowl , looks cheap . colors washed out , bird flower also , not vibrant shown . this item came nothing mfg ., no instuctions anything or who they . it well wrapped package ruined removing . apparently this planned . i told i could send it back free charge . what am i going send it ? good old amazon offered me 20% off keep it , this apparently their standard screw-up fee { not my first experience } . item i received not $80 item , or $64 item , it my yard , it remind me where not buy things future . beware !!!!	-1

there problems this outdoor fireplace right start . first , charbroil failed include hardware fireplace assembled . it must common occurence because huge letters , 2nd page manual , question " you missing parts ? " then , charbroil not make it easy just get packet nuts bolts . after calling number provided , i told proof payment specific model sent first . after sending required info , missing hardware arrived two weeks . once assembled , it worked fine but it rusted some over just one summer use touched up heat resistant spray paint . side screen doors flap wind because there nothing secure them place . rating one star because this just not quality product charbroil made me jump through proof payment hoop just get missing screws .	-1
field biologist involved hummingbird studies sw , i say red -- or any other color -- dye nonsense ! not needed , quite likely harmful . also , i question instant nectar -- instructions say it doesn't require boiling . there preservative it retards yeast bacterial growth ? if so it would likely extremely harmful gut hummers : it could harm their natural internal flora	-1
i purchases this gazebo i thought it quality product , found out after i erected it it made very cheap ... canvas looses color 2 months tie down clips top starts rust elastic stretch soon after .... now when wind hits top it flaps no longer stable ... then hold down clips one one breaks off now canvas top mercy wind . i lost my canvas top one night it riped off destroyed frame ... make long story short .. this product junk don't throw your money away it ..... make matters worse i contacted manufactor told they no replacement parts avalable ....	-1
this clock worked fine .... until congress changed timing daylight savings time . i three other " atomic " clocks two weather stations all them reset themselves new dst except this one . i've " forced " number resets removing even changing battery . each time this clock goes one 4 , 8 12 positions sits there until it receives signal boulder . then it resets itself but always standard time , one hour early . i'm eastern zone so i can't " cheat " it into showing correct time this model doesn't provisions set it manually . la crosse makes big deal their website how other manufacturers leave you lurch dst thing but they it covered . not . when you try contact them they don't answer their phones ignore customer emails . look elsewhere	1
this item not functional i thought . i miscalculated size which not big enough my purpose . also , brittle like surface cracking peeling off . i going exchange or return item but packaging discarded too soon	1
my husband so excited , when he got this station could not wait get it set up . he phone guy so he wired it all up under house spent many hours setting it up just right , only issues wind barameter . we tried trouble shoot online handwritten manuals . unfortunetly there no one contact nor there option return this product once you it out box .. sooooo needless say excitement gone ..	1
you should remove this merchant . they numerous complaints multiple websites . i ignored it trusted amazon brand . however , my experience horrible - they over charged me when i called rectify issue , they weren't interested trying solve problem , but simply place blame me . then service rep hung up me . i'll never business them again .	-1
ugh ! i agree , this thing never going ship !! i am now looking similar products . not happy this all	-1
this product my knowledge completely untested . i suspect it because it says it requires no boiling -- which sugestes it may contain preservative , yeast and/or bacterial inhibitor . this could not possibly good hummers . listen experts such sheri wlliamson ( peterson " hummingbirds north america . " ) sugar water just fine , filtered water best but not distilled	-1
i bought this item because great price , amazon shipped it regualr ups i received it earlier expected , box looked good shape but when i opened it one legs broken off , i thought first it must taken pretty good hit , so i called customer service they sent me return tag shipped me new one right out , i got it , opened it exact same thing , box good shape but 1 leg broken , i called customer service again they shipped one out , this time second day air . i get third one guess what , exact same thing third time ! i looked it carefully each time it broken weld two areas cooker it poor workmanship quality control , it even looked like it rusted one weld ! i can't say enough amazon customer service , but i wouldn't reccommend buying banjo cooker mail order	-1
i received lacrosse weather station gift . it started out working ok 4 weeks . plagued software communication problems i not recomend it anyone . tecnical support team little or no help . it all goes back old saying , you get what you pay . very dissatisified customer .	-1
nothing but trouble long run . anemometer replaced twice under warranty . now broken again just storms build up . sending unit no longer sends temp/humidity , even new batts .	-1

i this watch few months , feature wise it meets all my expectations , but i snagged it my backpack other day strap pins came off . no big deal i thought , i'll just snap it back - that when i noticed strap holder ripped through plastic casing thus unrepairable . over few months i it , it also discolored badly fake metal casing . great features , poor build quality . not recommended	-1
i use this bbq mesquite lump charcoal grilled excellent steaks , smoked some pork ribs , chicken , london broil giant hamburger so far . no marinade , just dry rub grill . book included accurate cook times long you keep temperature needle " i " ideal much cook time possible , which not hard . make sure " cure " it before you use it . this burns off all smells chemicals it manufacturing . cure it using propane burner . easy assemble too	1
i got this go my new silver weber i best chicken ribs i've very , very long time . it extremely simple assemble , operate most importantly , clean . i've two different rotisserie ovens i dreaded use based cleaning factor alone . cleaning this quick easy . small parts get clean simply placing hot , soapy water sink . i plan using this lot .	1
i bought this clock last week . amazon prompt shipping it time . received it i place aa battery clock selected time zone place it wall after some time clock second hand hour hand started moving fast . it actually searching signal . if it gets it immediately time set accurately 5 minutes . if not every hour clock searches accurate time relayed colorado server . clock finds time signal within next 4-5 hours . chances clock finding signal high over night when there less distortion . once ir receives accurate time it never fall behind . very good time piece	1
i return my 1st order due mould wood ( around joins ) inside glass front . my replacement little mould inside glass front , but i decided i could live it .. i blame amazon storage this rather than manufacturing it lacrosse . glass front spherical , so tends get weird light reflections , so watch this when you hanging it . note when battery low , second hand move 2 second jumps let you know battery low - this feature , not problem , which i like . other than it works great ! ( i live close boulder nist , where radio signal comes , so also take this into account when ordering any radio controlled clocks ) .	1
brush works well large enough keep you burning your hands . metal attachment perfect size cleaning weber grates . you can't go wrong this product amazon price	1
brush good job loosening grit grime your grill , but you still going break down wash grill soap water now then . brush strong wooden handle , leather loop , sturdy set bristles , grill scraper tough jobs . sure buy this longer brush 12-inch one not reach , especially larger grills	1
this clock set itself within few minutes worked well few months we've it . i loved not climb up get it down re-set it daylight savings time ! just so you know , this clock not silver color ( i thought it picture ) . it more pearlized off-white	1
i've bought two these atomic clocks . first , 12 " wood framed model , soon stopped keeping accurate time started acting unpredictably . second , this model , my wall week keeping good time after easy setup : insert battery , push est button . i am nicking it star because it makes noticeable tick sound quiet room , making it inappropriate bedroom	1
i found no issues . i put battery hit " et " it set keeping great time	1
considering i purchased this item my bedroom , i would say it perfect . aesthetic reasons i preferred analog wall clock , but thought hearing second hand tick all night not option until i found this item lacrosse . it could not anymore perfect , its looks , price , self ( time ) adjusting qualities made this . " m.f. " ( major find ) . now i sleep through daylight savings time adjustments not worry actual adjustment my clock , but whether or not i hour early , or late work	1
cover exactly what i needed protect our smoker weather . it strong appears durable . i felt price fair this product	1
this good rack ; it cleaned pretty easily nice compact size but ribs just bit too close together ( i cook mainly full spare ribs ) . i rib racks steven raichlen perfect . more spacious racks allow better basting , heat distribution more even cooking . when meat touches like weber rack , meat doesn't cook well	1
great looking quite large . easy see distance , though other two dials correspondingly small . updates quickly automatically unfailingly accurate . i wish i dozen them . price very reasonable also . i certainly buy more these clocks eventually .	1
this grill works great everytime ! only problem i lighter , but it not big deal . easy use , always give great grilling experiences	1
works great . cooking space grill holds large amount meat , fish , etc .. we would like see canister holds more gas than cooking only five meals .	1
purchased rotisserie basket after reading other reviews . i found basket work great . you put your meat grilled clamp down pieces . very easy . rock cornish game hens though , i needed tie them little bit , but because little legs . . . well little . never one before just skewer kind . cleans fairly easy too . love it .	1
weber products well made 9891 gas barbecue rotisserie no exception . ' basket ' style nice design .	1
no longer my wall clock wrong because power shortages or because i failed set it or reset it correctly	1
one thing which mystifies me how few people embraced latest modern clock technology : radio controlled clocks which keep exact time automatically synchronizing themselves signals broadcast incredibly accurate u.s. atomic clock boulder colorado . such clocks not only always accurate fraction second , they also automatically set themselves daylight savings standard time appropriate . furthermore , such clocks typically quite reasonable price . yet while most americans , example , latest modern cordless phones cell phones , relatively few accuracy convenience radio controlled clocks . this model just one many styles sold amazon other vendors . try one i think you'll glad you . my wife i several these clocks throughout our house take accurate time granted , no what time system effect	1
i give this 5 stars because price right name brand . it works ... it no better or worse than any other grille brushes i've used	1
item great quality last long time . exactly what i intended it	1
needs near window get time signal	1
really goes good my room . i really like it automatically synchronise per time zone daytime savings ...	1
i purchased 2 these clocks now . moment i inserted batteries clock started advancing stopped 4 ' o ' clock . i getting ready ship it back thinking it bad clock . but within 5 minutes both clocks received transmission corrected themselves exact time . so moral story don't return clocks without giving it some time it looks like these clocks stop 4 doesn't move all till it receives time	1
someone mentioned this just glorified trash bag . it not . it pretty durable careful use last long time	1
keeps ribs searing . lower profile than most rib racks so it easier turn rib	1
bought this use my weber smokey mountain . i almost bought sunbeam rib rack half price local home improvement chain but it seemed lot flimsier . this rack solid built weber quality . one reason i can't give it 5 stars because sunbeam rack skewers potatoes i would really like see this rack . if ribs too big , i just wrap them around wrap quite easily	1
i love this clock ! it big enough see all around back yard , looks great . keep mind they recommend keeping it sheltered extreme weather ... we ours under upper deck , so it sheltered rain . that extreme weather gets here los angeles	1
used it tri-tip last night it came out wonderfully . cranked high initially heat it up , then we left it low it kept 400+ degrees no problem ( it actually got too hot according my instant read thermometer ! ) . some complaints here say burner too loose . that because they used wrong washer mount it ! there one washer that larger than others . use wrong one it'll loose	1
these very handsome umbrellas appear sturdy well constructed . i like mechanism raising lowering umbrella -- very low tech smart . my one " issue " them really not their fault but my own inexperience what look -- they totally stationary , don't tilting feature . might standard , i just don't know , but i would wanted flexibility . oh , wood nicely stained brass fittings rather shiny but thankfully basically invisible . they're simple put together take apart . great price they block sun look terrific	1
we ordered umbrella replace one we many years . when product arrived , we surprised quality product such small price . we very satisfied	1
while 04 ' model performer slightly pricier than latest 05 ' model , there no comparision two models terms design , function , useability . if you want best charcoal grill made , your choice should 04 ' performer !!!	1
this most awesome , wonderful , fantastic grill there out there . everyone knows charcol can't beat flavor , but it bummer get started . weber outdone themselves inventing this amazing grill . it super easy start coals , easy keep clean looking fabulous , easy empty ashes , easy move around deck ( out our frequent seattle rain ) . course food we grill comes out delectable . i am grilling whole chicken tonight using indirect method . snap this grill ! it well worth price . we love it !!	1
grill wizard grill cleaning brush job cleaning grill better than any brush i've ever used . very little muscle required clean grill , especially if you clean after you cook when grill still warm .	1
if you're looking get your first smoker , look no further . since it horizontal-style smoker , it also double bbq pit/charcoal grill . plenty room , very versatile . treat it well it give you decade use . reason i can't give it 5 stars because thickness metal . if it little thicker , there would much more heat retention . you buy smokers 1/4 " + thickness , but expect pay least $600 . this easily best smoker its price range . make sure you season inside smoker similar how you would season cast iron pan . any smoker , before use , paint interior smoker shortening or vegetable oil , then start up smoker let it smoke couple or few hours . also , you should almost always keep chimney vent all way open . use intake vent firebox temperature control .	1
i bought this my bf christmas gift . he likes bbq little propane grill . i guess i should read measurements tools . they more suited huge grill . but its better than them tiny . good quality build . might want buy nicer package put them if giving gift .	1
worked designed , veggies , fish , small stuff cooked nicely , basted easily , etc . little large - hard close weber grill handle sticking out , it important keep grill closed . bit hard clean , too , but that just how these things . this one several similar units give good service . davi	1
i've used lot grill covers my time . this best - looks like it outlast last few i've tried just couldn't make it through year hot arkansas sun ! colors neutral though green more olive - but i didn't buy it color - bought it durability - course 6 months trial not make	1
off-color didn't bother me . i expected after reading all reviews . i agree it could 6 " lower ground . however there 3 " flaw stitching one seam . bead duco cement sealed up , it never seen back side grill . heavy duty material looks like it stand test time weather	1
i placed ws-8249u atomic clock i bought couple months ago next this one , they both showed different indoor temperature humidity . this one displayed lower humidity ( 47% vs 51%) higher indoor temperature ( 80.4 vs 78.9 )than ws-8249u . i no idea which one more accurate . out door temperature displayed same because they both received same signal transmitter ws-8249u . ws-8256u smaller than i thought it . i prefer ws-8249u ws-8256u because it nicer larger display .	1
keeping this smoker up temperature chore until i invested heavy duty 25 foot extension cord . i bought 12 gage 15 amp 25 foot chord i'm now actually using thermostat back off temperature . i got this cord lowes it cost around $18 dollars . manual says use 50 foot or less cord your smoker .. but it makes sense use short cord you . also .. thanks tip previous reviewer drilling hole bottom smoker allow excess water drain out . got go my ribs almost .	1
i just got this turner it feels really nice my hand . grip feels very comfortable turner very nice solid balanced feel . i got this turner so it would work better cast iron griddle i got . i tried out tonite cooking burgers it felt easier flip patties than normal cheap spatula . i felt like short order cook !	1
overall , this outstanding grill . i've it year , it awesome . it gets hot quickly , it sears food well , it all bells whistles . stainless steel grates primary reason get platinum not gold . they worth it , unless you want use plain cast iron constantly oil them ( which also you'd buy ) . couple things consider though : 1 . design kind retarded smoker box . using smoker box rotisserie chore , you can't really open smoker box because spit , smoker box seems want rely grates ( which i remove use rotisserie ) so grates gone it tip over easily . 2 . grill blown out few times . i think this due fact i don't follow instructions turn gas off when i'm using it , i just turn grill off . so regulator protection mechanism gets tripped , off grill goes . so i've changed way i use it , it hasn't blown out since . 3 . there these weird chains doors cabinet . i no idea what they , no one able tell me . so , if i it over again , i'd get exact same grill , it worth every single penny .	1
i am extremely happy this . perfect accent lights my front planter . i definitely buy set side planter . price right but shipping costs little too high . well packaged delivery .	1
i bought my genisis silver six years ago . despite some abuse me ( not covering it when it raining , ignoring grease fires while watching tv , not cleaning it regularly , not replacing flavorizer bars ) it still going strong continues produces most delicious burgers , steaks grilled chicken ever . i'm really glad i invested weber not cheaper brand . size , me perfect . you fit lot meat this grill	1
i purchased this grill my husband four years ago we still very happy it . it held up very well . when we problems it lighting back burner , i called customer service they extremely helpful . they saved me buying whole new burner set explaining me how remove tubes , check clean them . we now replacing racks flavorizer bars ( $60.00 ) since they just too hard clean after all this time . i found replacement parts home depot lowes which plus know i easily get parts . i don't see us haveing buy new grill anytime near future	1
i'm happy my grill . putting it together wasn't hard . it took me under hour also , but one thing note when putting right bar container make sure container placed properly before you completely jam bar or else it very difficult remove bar properly place container . grilling great , flames consistent . cleaning pain though , but i think thats pain all grills .	1
purchased this cover protect my new weber q300 grill . fits like glove ! strong durable construction superior protection .	1
well i like cover , but i it hard put . i hoped it would slip over grill easily . it not , it tight fit . quality cover excellent . i just wish they made it little larger so it would go over grill easier	1
you can't beat it when all you unwrap it use it ! cover high quality , perfect fit product ( odd shape all ) looks great fully protects grill . i highly recommend itgt	1
exactly same original grates came bbq . arrived fast packed well .	1
this umbrella quality belies its bargain price . it assembled easily opens/closes smoothly . construction seems sturdy , fabric smelled freshly laundered when it came out shipping crate . my only complaint , it almost trivial , resin finial faded rather quickly sunlight . i'm overall quite pleased product i'm looking places my yard utilize more these	1
we replaced old , larger broken sunbeam " bug snapper " this unit . this lighter easier handle . we're southern arizona , so our bug season just starting . unit works great , but upon encountering really big moth it sizzles long ten seconds . . . kind gruesome . if you're dealing night-flying insects this solution	1
i used flowtron products years . this year coudn't find one locally , purchased brand ! lated one month andhad replace bulb . new bulb lasted less than month . total cost twice flowtron bk-40 . flowtron bk-40 last " one year " 24-7 year around . like car , weatherand age takes it toll . but you'll need clean deadcritters off every other week . finally , found flowtron onamazon . thanks , no critters around my house , big or small	1
this thing works great . i prefer keep bottled beer hand so i never chance make beer chicken . chicken i cooked came out perfect . crispy skin juicy inside . excellent ! i'm going dry lemon juice wine next time . bottom tray holds all grease so your grill stays clean . highly recommended	1
this grill greatest simplicity ease use . it compact portable , so there no unsightly grill always hanging around your house or patio . i use it summer winter , even set it up snow . if you charcoal grilling exclusively , i , this grill flexibility adjust combustion air exhaust suite what you cooking . high temperatures , such steaks , i leave top cover off . takes perhaps 5 6 grillings before one learns all right charcoal loadings vent adjustments necessary . cools off totally 15 minutes if you close all vents .	1
umbrella i ordered fine , just what i hoped it would . however , i subsequently ordered umbrella stand ( after you prompted me so ) when it arrived two tightening screws shaft damaged shipment . each screws plastic knobs knobs broken off . result when one tightens them broken plastic sharp enough cut skin . i tried unsuccessfully find replacements hardware store . any suggestions	1
enough cheap looking patio umbrellas tear bend after 3 or so thunderstorms ? try this one ! very nice design , looks great , simulated wood finish pole , easy open close . we very satisfied	1
my old grill well over-due replacement , so i started doing some research into replacement . my previous grill coleman , lasted good 10 years , although cooking quality definately deteriorated . i going purchase " cheapy " grill , but my research , i noticed something - almost every weber owner rated their grill 5-star , whereas cheapies usually mustered three stars best . little more research quickly pointed out why - webers may not last any longer than cheaper competitors , but 10-year old weber still cooks better than cheap ones when brand new . i invested " platinum " . but yet use side-burner , so i'm not sure how valuable . i delighted quality grill - it easy assemble , cooking quality - fantastic . i purchased weber griddle , i also pizza stone , these two additions , i cooked 8 meals row my weber , including bacon eggs , home-made bread , pizza , course , grilled steak	1
first thought spending $750 grill seemed insane . then i started adding up all $250-$350 grills i've buy 7-years i've owned my home . based reading hundreds reviews , i figured stainless steel grill made weber would last grill i'd buy . i think i might right . i bought natural gas version , which i would highly recommend . no more messing around propane . just turn valve you've got flame . i've grill outdoors 4 months now ( somtimes covered , sometimes not ) there no signs any corrosion anywhere . stainless steel cleans easily polishes up nicely . drip catch system higher quality than i've seen , ceramic coated ' funnel ' drains juices down tin catch pan . nothing collects near flames so flare-ups minimized . ' flavorizer ' bars immediately incinerate any grease falls them . grill easy dismantle cleaning . fron t-t o-back burners provide perfectly even heat lot it . thermometer grill easily spins past highest marking 600 degrees . these temperatures steaks sear nicely grill almost ' self cleaning ' since any stuck-on food almost completely incinerated . anything remains grill easily scrapes off stainless steel grates . fron t-t o-back burners also allow you use grill like oven . shutting off center burner , you use indirect heat cook food without searing it . insulated hood keeps heat inside which makes grill more efficient but also makes it easier stand next while cooking ( not much heat radiates around grille ) . i'm convinced this grill excellent investment	1
i through atleast 3 grills prior this one . i type person would buy $200 job sears or something figure i'll get five years out this one . never . 2-3 seasons tops . this grills you know last . solid , stainless steel , warranties more than couple months . its built last gaurenteed last aleast five years . it worth every penny you spend .	1
you may wonder why it took me 20 years write this review ... well after using this rotisserie all time , motor finally stopped working . so , i got new motor this week . i'm ready go . i cooked just anything you put stick . everyone says , results just phenomenal . i've 16-21 lb turkeys , standing rib roasts , leg ' o lamb , pork roasts , chickens , duck , goose , you name it , i've cooked it . just put food , add few hot brickets every so often , let her o.o ne tip , there two ways cook this . if you want even heating , don't take lid off too often . releasing heat lid off you lose " convection " effect , but that not all bad . some meats , like leg lamb , where you want outside crisp , keeping lid off works well if you stoke your fire keep it hot . finally , weber customer service phenomenal	1
this far best grill accessory i every gotten . it cooks chickens perfection keeps them juicy moist tender . i haven't tried cooking anything else , but i'm sure whatever it it would come out great . i would definitely suggest this anyone who weber charcoal grill	1
just purchased weber platinum b4 grill , ( should bought through amazon too , thats story ) , so i needed cover keep it nice . bought it saturday arrived wednesday . very nice cover , very thick , almost rubber like vinyl cover . they improved cover since last one i received weber . they enlarged opening way allow cover easily fit over grill , this huge really , it used like wrestling alligators get cover over grill now it almost falls over grill hangs there . anyway summation it very thick , fits installs really easily looks great , absolute necessity investment grill thats now over thousand dollars	1
plain simple - very effective . i plugged this device wall my office school . within seconds roaches our kitchen area ran into hallway . they not seen since . there not any mouse droppings around either .	1
you put up 6 shelves inside fully use all cubic space available . but you may just need 4 leave lower two open big size items stored . rubbermaid similar size shed but it only accept three shelves waste lot spaces . rubbermaid shed uses much fewer pieces assembly than this one . assmbly pretty easy if you follow manu but it take some time ( 1-2 hours ) . after i finished assembly there some rain inside try except couple water drops . only concern its sturdiness since it assembled 28 pieces so far so good . i don't expect it stand ternado or hurricane . one thing i wan alert you : when you buy shelves measure inside ignore manu since if you buy side according it yuo find shelves shift too much left or right . you want them more stable , right ? recommended .	1
i tried rotisserie i got auction , sadly disappointed . mounting brackets not fit , there no counterweight , meat forks cheaply made . this unit however , great . first , mounting brackets truly " universal " , should fit just any grill . mine mounted perfectly my aussie bonza deluxe 3 grill without issue . installation only takes 5 minutes . mounting brackets allow various distances your grill mounting holes , multiple sets holes allow various height adjustments . if your grill two holes either side , you should se t.t he single-piece spit rod heavy duty , counter weight included heavy enough assist balancing heavier roasts ( or chickens ) , four-pronged meat forks well made . motor comes long cord ( 3 feet- most other units much shorter cords ! ) , fact motor on/off switch nice plus . lastly , all praise i give this unit , i also pleased it attractively priced . i seen many other rotisseries seem much more expensive , not built nearly well	1
i found this smoker great . i am not pro , so take my opinion such . i bought this last week put it together 1/2 hour . only problem i flimsy weld control panel broke , which meant it not hook onto bottom smoker neatly . it nothing little electrical tape could not fix , probably my fault forcing it . i plan fixing it bolt nut later this week . rest unit looks well built . far smoking , it great . i put some garlic water water pan , mix apple mesquite wood chip bin , put smoker low . long i vent wide open it stayed 175 . if i closed vent temp got up 200 . whole chicken i cooked great . after four hours smoking my back patio , chicken moist delicious hint bbq . it smoking pretty good couple hours . my wife doubts me buying smoker . now she bbq menu planned next week . all all i would recommend this friend . it easy use keeping heat consistent throughout smoking very easy propane controls vent	1
only complaint i my gas smoker it damaged when delivered ( this also case friend mine who ordered same smoker)it dented several places . i cooked many 12 whole chickens time they all came out fully cooked juicey . it great way cook . just put your meat , adjust your heat then set back visit your guest while smoker all work . after people tasted my smoked faire they always ask where i got my smoker . several my friends bought this smoker their own use	1
i bought great outdoors deluxe gas smoker my first smoker first time i used it , i cooked two pork boston butt . i never used smoker before i worried heat fluxuating , ( i think thats how you spell it ) , alot . once i got heat set(in 20 minutes ) i put two pork butt left it till next morning . i woke up checked temp it perfect . everyone who some my smoked pork thought i proffesional smoking my great outdoors deluxe gas smoker . i am doing some beef brisket this weekend see how it turns out . alot people saying thier smoker bad shape because packing manufacturer but smoker i bought lowe packed cardboard box foam supporting everything nothing damaged or scratched my smoker . i would recommend this smoker anyone wants very good easy use smoker . oh yeah ' it also easy clean !	1
hammock great choice if you like sharing it you significant other or yourself . it very sturdy comfortable , even two adults . quality hammock good worth price , especially compared other models we looked	1
this very neat hammock . it very comfortable easy get out . it course not allow air flow through like rope hammock , but so much more comfortable . i also bought matching pillow really enjoy lazy summer evenings now . i roll mine up bring it inside when i'm not using it , which quick easy make it last much longer . it hold adults , but little crowded	1
this awesome set !! my husband i use it all time . it looks great really take beating	1
i got my first weber ( genesis ) get smoker try ' er out . kinda wishing i saved my money just got smokey mt though ... here why : i got my grill home depot so i would nice cast iron porcelin enamel coated grates . when using smoker you must remove one grate replace it supplemental smaller grate so smoker fit side . this grate not sear like cast iron !!! weber also not make cast iron fit this size , so when using smoker , you only get 1/2 grill make nice sears . however , i havn't taken it out since i bought it over week ago , so i guess flavor worth it . ;-) regards previous review , i no trouble smoking pork sholder 5 hours , smoke thick rolling whole time . i think key soak chips minimum 30 minutes ( i'll let them soak hours if i think ahead ) . make sure you load up enough chips - i pretty much filled tray up . shut lid smoker !!! part key ! especially when heating up grill . when heating high i've found it takes slightly under 10 minutes start smolder , turn down grill now ! before it starts full smoke !! i wasn't going " low slow " ... but wanted maintain 325 degree oven entire time . i checked internal temp 3 , 4 , 5 hours getting pork up internal temp 182 ( figured it would rise couple degrees after i took it off ) . pulled pork amazing ! plus i got pink ring !!! it my first smoking experience i fed 10 people recipe weber nation ( i doubled it ) . so long story short ... if you already gas grill don't want invest $300+ smoker ... try it out ! it may not great smokey mt . but it really smokes	1
i bought this pillow because i just got new hammock my backyard i felt it needed one . what else i say hammock pillow ? soft , smooth fabric , prefect those weekend afternoon quot ; cat napsquot	1

i've these chairs week ( i bought two ) they look fabulous my front porch . they comfortable too . my expectations exceeded . like reviewer , i too searched adirondack chairs andfound prices ridiculously high . this chair ottomanfor $84.99 ($10 shipping ) steal !! quality construction seem far outweigh price . i only gave 4 stars because i can't comment durability maintenance after only week . strathwood recommends teak oil couple times year . i also purchased 30 " folding table place chairs - what set !!! if you're thinking this chair , don't hesitate , you not disappointed !	1

after extensive research despite less-than-exptected consumer reports ratings , i chose purchase 2007 weber summit s-450 grill . i own 5-year-old charbroil bowing out losing heat/smoke when i cook so i wanted multi-fuctional grill replace it would last longer . summit s-450 includes beautiful smoker box dedicated burner rotisserie kit . more importantly , it weber , which means great warranty customer service built last . when i opened item my friends we all salivated heavy-duty construction this grill . impressive stainless steel high-grade grill very heavy . no wobbling . it very easy set up took one hour . let me say although i expected this grill better than my old , i never thought it would so impressive all aspects . weber thinks everything when they make grill . heavy gauge stainless steel grates high-end burners this grill really catches your eye . researched grills all local hardware big box stores , i honestly say this grill beat them all just looks materials alone . even before i attached propane lit thing ! when i test burners i extremely impressed ignition system . i've never seen anything like it all burners , including rotisserie side lit first try . grill got up heat very quickly eveness heat evident buy looks using hand test over grates . while i only cooked hamburger my first meal , i pleasantly surprised beautiful grill marks grates left . i lot slow-cooking smoking thermometer , smoker box , seal grill certainly improve my grilling carolina pulled pork briskett . further , knobs/temperature controls seem offer infinite heating options . i cannot wait experiment learn this grill i add items my menu . while i just got this grill yesterday , i am more than hopeful quality craftmanship truly believe it last triple amount my charbroil . i'll add this review i continue use this wonderful grill	1
we stuck this outside our bedroom window - now we see what temperature outside soon we get up morning . no more waiting weather come news figure out what wear !	1

finally - grill cover actually stays grill protects it worst weather . velcro straps keep it secure but it very easy remove when ready use grill . this 4th or 5th grill cover we've tried it last one we try . i would recommend this product anyone investing iin grill . why not spend couple bucks more so your $400 grill doesn't rust out two seasons	1
man what awesome weber item .. it cooked chicken so well clean up charm . i think im planning buy cook two birds once .	1
very easy use . simply fill aluminum cup tray beer , wine , fruit juice , or some other beverage . extra flavor , add spice well . place infusion cone top cup , then place chicken top infusion cone . once chicken place , put infusion cap top lock steam . steam cooks chicken inside , heat outside . chicken tender juicy inside while skin cooked golden , crispy brown . fat grease drain away chicken collect bottom roaster instead grill . remove cooked chicken roaster : remove infusion cap . next , take pair tongs go down back side chicken slide it off infusion cone . this easy since roaster nonstick . if your chicken heavy , you may need support it second set tongs	1
using this procuct makes changing propane tanks really quick procedure . just remember pull outer ring back before installing male part . additional items need offered if you not just ordering extra one your weber grill . 1 ) adapter propane retailer fill your tank . 2 ) male portion this quick connect adapter so other propane appliances attached your tank . it doesn't look like it included offered . quick connect adapter itself won't you any good	1

i easily read display 7-8 feet away dim light . base unit receives its signal remote i placed north side house shaded porch . 4 walls since two units located diagonally across my house . absolutely no problems reception . i purchased additional remote ( thr138 ) . when i place base two remotes side side room temperature let them stabilize 15 minutes , all three agree within 0.3 degrees farenheit . read manual ! add batteries remote(s ) first , press reset button(s ) something non-conductive ( toothpick ) , then add batteries base unit . i live cold climate . while i haven't experienced sub-zero temps since purchasing this unit , my other oregon scientific wireless thermometer , rar232 , worked just fine alkaline batteries -16f this season . excellent value	1

we not only use this roasts . we cradle chicken , turkey , pork rolls cooking also . we pleased so far . nickel-plated steel rack cleans easily too	1
i really hoping larger grill but i should read measurements ! after reading directions , you put foil drip pan bottom surround this your coals ... then if you cooking something needs longer cooking time , you keep adding coals .. i don't get how you would this if you grill full hot food .. seems little inconvenient me . it okay few burgers dogs but i think i'll invest larger grill next time	1

i saw review this grill regarding cover already ... i just wanted reiterate cover listed this grill incorrect . cover numbered ' 9911 ' not cover one touch performer . you need order cover numbered ' 9986 ' get proper cover this grill . i confirmed this weber . if you ever issues your grill ... not hesitated call or email weber ... their customer svc . out this world . otherwise , this fantastic grill . i grew up eating off webers i own old school 18 " kettle i long i remember .... weber smokey mountain cooker ( must ) now this performer . although given me gift , worth every penny .	1
i bought performer amazon 9 months ago now never got around reviewing it . yesterday , i cooking some pork chops it , i made mental note come here review . personally , i believe it best charcoal grill most people . like others said , it so easy get charcoal started without using lighter * gag * fluid . yes , you could use chimney accomplish this same time i used chimney years . but small child , dog , dry conditions here dallas , performer solution so much safer . performer cooks well any weber kettle which fantastic . work area nice holder charcoal very clever . i really can't imagine better charcoal grill non fanatic . i missing part my grill when i received it . however , one call weber part me days . it wheel so it wasn't big deal -- i could assemble everything else . final disclosure -- i am pretty big fan weber products . when i bought this i three other weber grills . i found performer replaced both old standard kettle my genesis gas grill . performer ready so quick i just never used gas grill any more . gave it friend no regrets .	1

i love my brinkman smoker . but i some modifications get it its present state : offset firebox arrangement : using plain old charcoal cost you fortune ! when i first got this christmas present , i found this out quick ! i went thru whole 20 pound bag kingsford . too costly ! so what i buy propane tank propane burner . i ran burner metal intake connector out brinkman air intake vent . perfect fit ! vent also held up one end propane burner . then i placed regular brick inside firebox support other side propane burner . i now all heat i want , cheaply also i now pretty good temperature control ! i also agree poster optional temperature gauge placed brinkman cutout waste money would inaccurate . i it regret buying thing . however get remote smoker temperature unit gives you two separate temperature probes readings . this way you monitor both meat internal smoker temps without opening huge smoking chamber lid which would waste all your heat smoke ! speaking smoke ...... it drove me crazy figuring out how make sustained source smoke wouldn't snuff out propane burner process ! here what i solve this new problem : take off " hobbit " external smoke stack . then take off flimsy end cap holds swivel lid exhaust vent . drill , carefully make 1/8 inch hole thru welded rod end cap attached . replace lid . now , take tie-wire or maybe cotter pin put into hole you just made so swivel lid won't fall off you invert it ....... invert it ??? yes , invert it . see , you stuffing hickory wood blocks into this inverted pipe . part swivel lid placed directly onto propane burner . end smoke stack should positioned into smoking chamber . this way smoke produced , smoke go directly into chamber not fire box which if it would snuff out propane burner ! speaking hickory smoke ...... don't buy chips ! it too costly ! buy instead hickory wood blocks . i buy mines home depot large bags super cheap ! i use my small axe carefully size hickory blocks so it fits snuggly into inverted smoke stack . works like magic . oh , one more thing ...... place hickory wood block you carefully sized into now stubby smoking chamber exhaust pipe , where smoke stack used attach . wood block block just enough so most smoke stays inside chamber wood block allow just enough air flow so offset firebox propane burner get its air . there you it . perfect smoker cheap operate effective generating smoke ! don't forget place metal pot ontop propane burner full water . you need this boiling create needed steam your smoker performance	1
i this smoker 8 years . i live east coast florida , it subjected great many adverse conditions . sun , rain , heat , salt air occasional 150+ mph sandblasting . only degradation it experienced 2 legs ( without wheels ) need replacing due rusting off bottom , grills replaced . maintenance snap , just regular cleaning occasional coat oven black . she may not youngest lady ball , but she still makes best ribs , chicken steak	1
what great piece equipment . elegant its simplicity , seems very sturdy ... easy assemble , if you organize first ! offers many cooking options , well made , great price ... wonderful brisket , can't wait till thanksgiving .. smoked turkey , yum ! it covered yard but use year round	1

hammock fine , particularly great price unfortunately , my pine trees dripped sap onto hammock , which pain get off . not hammock fault - i guess it just wasn't such good idea	1
ws-9119u weather station monitors outside temp humidity inside temp humidity . further it monitors barometric pressure , make gross prediction weather change via pictoral representations weather . price , it serves function , but it not all encompasing scientific weather station ..... most which cost hundreds , if not thousands dollars . this unit good observe outside weather conditions , monitor inside conditions , monitor gross weather change .... this it reliable relatively inexpensive instrument	1
some reviews this weather station looked pretty poor , but i took chance bought it anyway . overall i am very pleased glad i didn't take reviews too seriously . i found temperature accuracy seems fine ; i put base unit , external sensor , second extra sensor , my old radio shack digital thermometer all same location , within half hour they all within 1 degree each other , indicating me temperature sensors consistently acccurate . i also no problem lcd viewing angle ; it adjustable seems wide viewing angle anyway so i haven't seen any need adjust it . one my few complaints all external temperature sensors shown display " outside " temperature , where reality i would think it more likely most users place one sensor outside , any extra sensors beyond would indoors ( i could wrong here ) . first i concerned forecasting function would ' confused ' seeing several outside temperature/humidity readings vary greatly , but eventually i found one sentence manual indicates only first external sensor used weather forecasting . so it little confusing but works fine long you make sure external sensor #1 truly outside temperature . heads-up base unit larger than i imagined , it looks pretty chunky sitting my bathroom vanity . so sure read dimensions	1
i really like these clocks . our school constantly problems clocks all classrooms different this really helped situation . digital ones better but la crosse ones , which least expensive , also happen best analog clocks we've tried	1
this cushion extra long extra thick - should work most any chaise lounge . it really firm support . not one those puffy things go flat one season . i highly recommend it .	1
i purchased my oregon scientific station 8 years ago . internal sensor batteries need changed annually , i've changed rechargeables outside once ... i live georgia we get lots sun . other than needing reset unit every 6 months ( gets confused near lightning strikes , but then what wireless electronics don't ? ) perhaps not high precision rain gauge i'd like , it more than adequate any home weather enthusiast	1
well sometimes it pays take chance . after reading negative review these tongs i went ahead bought them anyway ... i love steven raichlen show his books . well , either i disagreement earlier review or they fixed ' em . these tongs work great , very heavy duty handling big slabs meat like i like cook , extra length keeps my hands cool without gloves . i vote 5 stars . keep bbq'ing	1

if you like big weber grills but need small one tailgating , this great choice . i no problem putting 3 , 4 , or even 5 steaks this grill no problem . it tight well buil t.t he only thing i don't like kind cheap side went covers . they come flat so they don't conform shape grill . you kind form them bending them around your knee or something then they fit fine . i give this grill 9 out 10 brats . edit , one year later : they made big mistake moving vent holes traditional place bottom kettle sides . it completely changes air flow result consistently cold fire . my three minutes per side burgers normal webber more like five or six minutes per side this little grill . bottom line this grill ok tailgating camping , but i don't use it nearly much i thought i would if i just one grill , i'd get one other webbers vents bottom . this grill disappointment me	1

i am using this clock indoors , very nice looks large enough use big wall without looking " cheap " . main concern i before getting this battery life , i heard bad stories some atomic clocks using up battery(s ) little 30-45 days , but since receiving this 3 months ago , it still going strong first charge rechargeable battery i put . i really like fact i easily tell what time it across room down hall without my glasses even pretty badly near-sighted	1
this third three these clocks i purchased our city council chambers . first i somewhat leery location our chambers would make it difficult clocks automatically set themselves via radio setting , but this turned out unwarranted . result we three clocks now automatically keep perfect time , all synchronized , all automatically adjusting daylight savings time standard time . past , keeping three clocks one room synchronized impossible , made more difficult since these 15 feet up wall . features temperature humidity added bonus . price 25% much compared other clocks our city investigating . all , i am totally impressed these clocks , their operation , their pricing , so much so , i bought two my home one my travel trailer	1

after receiving my la crosse atomic clock , i followed 4 simple steps back box left it hanging my wall overnight near window west side my house . basically , set it up all you install aa battery press button back clock set your time zone ( et , ct , mt , or pt ) , clock rest overnight . reception signal appearently clearest during night , according instruction manual . anyway , next morning after hanging it my wall clock perfect synchronization time shown my directv satellite tv . i live greater seattle area no trouble receiving atomic timekeeping radio signal ft . collins , co . i'd rate this clock 5 star buy . only slight downside construction inexpensive plastic ( not metal ) , but then clock would probably cost lot more if it metal . note : manual warns this may not work interior building . also , clock probably won't receive signal if you're inside metal-framed building ( such office tower ) . wooden buildings lots windows work best , especially if you're far colorado	1
i am impressed this product . all parts clearly marked . all parts included box . directions excellent . no complaints here	1

i am no pro grilling , but this grill makes it all so easy ! it easy put together , easy use , easy clean up . everything i toss it turns perfectly grilled absolutely yummy ! there cheaper charcoal grills out there , but if you're petite woman , like me , who doesn't grill living , it well worth extra money little conveniences this grill . i got 18 1/2 inch grill , it plenty room preparing dinner 4-6 adults . since putting my grill together , i cooked out every weekend	1
i owned brinkman smoker 14 years ... not this one , but more simple model costs $85.00 . i smoked several turkeys , many chickens , salmon , pork roasts .... all great success . two things i think might help your low temperature problem : 1 . you use extension cord it ? i once same problem you when i used long extension cord . troubleshooting , i searched manual came it found it says not use long extension cords ( you'll search your manual maximum optimum length ) . please don't give up your smoker ! i get much more tender , juicy results than i my flambeed grilled meats !! ha ha ! smoker easy use , no fuss not too bad mess clean if you line your water pan heavy duty foil ! i use easy-off oven cleaner my two racks water pan sure rinse them very well . i leave four hours my food ready when i return ( just sure your water pan always liquid it ) when we company , they love smoked flavor . hope this helps . once i eliminated long extension cord , all well . 2 . you peeking your turkey or basting it ? my lid also small gap through which smoke escapes , but it doesn't affect it . you cannot constantly open lid peek or baste this allows heat escape it take while smoker reach proper temperature again . no need baste smoker ! meat always juicy . i found your review because after 14 years , i'm seeing rust my smoker , which one best our wedding gifts . i never owned cover it but always stored it garage when not use . this last year , however , it spent much time neglected outside ( i four children now ) i wanted research smokers find replacement our trusty old one ! i would highly recommend brinkman electric smoker anyone who considering purchasing one ( sorry , i've never tried brand ) . it so much easier than grilling because you never need watch over your food prevent charring . i guess you could say smoker grill crockpot oven , except unlike crockpot food , meat appear beautifully golden-browned no blackness .	1
this great product own . we really enjoy able know current outisde temp anytime we would like , especially here nebraska where we so many extremes , summer winter . inside thermometer perfectly accurate ( compared our themostat ) , outside temperature accurate within couple degrees ( compared internet weather sites ) , although i think variances sun changes , etc . not necessarily defect product . trickiest thing owning this weather station figuring out where locate outside sensor , it out direct sunlight moisture , but still within range internal display . it great gift we really enjoyed owning it	1
this thermometer hydrometer not only attractive , but works beautifully . i given one gift later bought one give gift	1
this garden bench very well made extremely attractive . color elegant . i it small sun room it perfect . cushion fabric sturdy enough withstand my dogs , but cushion itself could heftier . bench lightweight , giving impression it not solid sturdy , but supported whatever i subjected it --- i 10 dogs love couch ! i would give it 5 stars if cushion made better foam	1

i love sunflower seeds , chocolate , cherries , so you imagine my delight when i found these chocolate cherry sunflower seeds available amazon . when packet arrived , i tore it open downed entire contents into my eager mouth , expecting explosion chocolate-cherry-sunflowery sapidity . instead , i got mouthful hard shells . i crunched through tough , outer hulls , wondering inventiveness manufacturers who somehow injected chocolate cherry flavors into hard , unopened shells , but then i macerated both hull softer kernel into splintery mash , found chocolate cherry flavors somehow gone missing . when my wife came home , i mentioned her how i ripped off chocolate cherry sunflower seeds which lacked both chocolate cherry flavors , fact , barely edible . my wife picked up empty packet , looked it moment , then hit me over head dining room chair . " you idiot , " she said , " these seeds planting . " she then clobbered me antique , oak coat tree . " i don't know why i ever married you , " she continued , " you always doing stupid , embarrassing things , no matter how hard i hit you , you never learn . " she then whacked me coffee table emphasis . maybe i gotten bad batch seeds . i think i order them again , next time , manufacturers better not forget chocolate cherry flavors , or someone going get beating	1

i bought this table four chairs also made strathwood . i it my patio where i see flame our hot tub it looks gorgeous burning dusk . i number people comment way it looks i unable find better value . it looks like it lot heavier than it , it remarkably easy move piece cake assemble even myself . drawbacks black mesh screen needs stored somewhere else ( there no hidden nooks where you stick it easy access when you decide light fire ) it sits lower than your average table , so if you need sit use table work or read , it isn't going work you . it fine eating casually , though . there little screws bottom legs so you level table without using other hardware if you uneven surface like i , you move it around adjust it easily stop any wobbling . other issue i chairs made same company don't fully fit under table , armrests little too high , so they won't push all way under table .	1

can't say too much replacement ignitor system but it works . it installed easily expected , appeared slightly better quality than part it replaced . if previous part any indication , it should last 5-7 years , hard believe this time designed obsolesence	1

i thought bench very good buy money . it fits perfectly small area our deck	1
pump works well , certainly good expected excellent price ! it , however , leave least inch oil bottom pot . instructions say this last bit oil too dirty , it best discarded . reality , design pump just doesn't allow it suck oil up low level . i , however , able sufficiently filter most these last few cups oil using pump large-mouth jar . when poured into jar much smaller diameter , oil deep enough pump get it , leaving only small amount i didn't mind discarding	1
i hate admit , but we roaches ! actually , we roaches until last week when i purchased this product . i tried everything : sprays , bombs , traps , etc ... but nothing worked . first day i plugged this little device , there such great increase bug activity my kids wouldn't go into kitchen . day 3 , roaches gone ! i don't know where they went , i don't care . this device saved my sanity	1
this ideal instrument us . we like walk early morning - when temperature outside above 40 degrees ! projected time temperature tell us whether we need get out bed - or sleep little longer . weather forecasting feature also useful - least accurate tv forecasts	1
love large illuminated time/temp ceiling . setting up external temperature sensor bit tricky , you'll need make sure you glasses size screwdriver , which i didn't readily available . otherwise everything worked promised . i am still not positive if " atomic " sensor working . instructions said you something like 750 miles ( or it 1000 ) away location denver etc . i am detroit so signal never seemed sync up , but it may i am not sure . all all great purchase .	1
since i started using this unit i cooked my best thanksgiving turkey , my best christmas ham my best new year pork roast ever . only reason it not 5 star i've needed booklet almost every time i've used it . controls aren't difficult , but they aren't really intuitive either . i'd go 4-1/2 stars if i option	1

very , very happy this appliance . i bit sceptical before ordering when i read `stamped metal ' but when it arrived , yes it stamped metal ( not every component , though ) , but very heavy gauge metal very well engineered . i used it immediately after i received it wow ! talk `dragon`s breath!' very high btu food cooked like i never experienced . finally , authentic oriental cooking home . highly recommended . update : well , i've using this quite long time now i am even more pleased than ever . i remember asking chinese chef china town how come i can't make food like this home . he stated ( heavy oriental dialect ) , " you gotta use hot wok . wok gotta very , very hot ! " yep , that secret . you never replicate authentic oriental cooking ordinary gas or electric stove . " you gotta use hot wok !! " this devise puts out btus very " hot wok " indeed	1

this little weather station works well pretty simple set up . you read instructions get remote sensor sync , but otherwise easy . i found this one better looking units os . it medium size numbers easy read . reading barometric pressure outdoor temp humidity , it pretty good job predicting weather . order get outside temp there remote sensor . effective you need mount it shady area screw . also instructions suggest more expensive lithium batteries ( not included ) remote sensor because alkaline batteries only measure temps down just below freezing , then batteries freeze . lithium batteries allow temp readings all way down chilly -22 . my only disappointment this unit main display not wall mountable , only desk stand . also radio signal clock setting comes goes	1
i owned this clock 3 yrs now just love it . numbers easy read set-up breeze . i've changed batteries only once during this time . very accurate in-door out-door temperatures . i definately recommend this clock	1

this remote temperature sensor works conjunction base unit permits you monitor outdoor temp humidity well indoor temp , anywhere your house . i keep base unit my bedroom then tell both outdoor temp lower level indoor temps when getting dressed day . i think system works very well reasonable cost	1
besides outdoor temperature relative humidity , i use base station inside three remote wireless monitors measure temperature humidty my crawlspace , attic outdoors monitor possible water intrusion issues if there freezing temperature concerns pipes during cold weather periods	1
i lot research if you follow directions , it safe fun . it takes 25 min heat oil 45 minutes cook 11 lb . turkey . pot maximum oil level mark correct amount our bird . turkey must dried well prevent spattering . watch oil temp . so it not go over 350 . it outdoors paint burn off burners it smells .	1

amazing little grill . 8 charcoal briquettes , i cooked couple salmon-burgers it lunch , then put two cornish game hens , put cover , let them bake hour , them later dinner . note : don't peak under lid when using this grill oven . heat escapes it takes awhile build it back up . instead , use your nose ears . excellent little grill camping , picnics , emergencies . since it uses so little fuel , you great deal cooking single bag charcoal . don't use lighter fluid , use small " starter stick " start coals .	1

i just put mine together it warns you mustn't keep gas connected each time you reattach gas you soap test . i guess i keep screwing propane tank off , but that such pain soapy water messy ! first roast turned out well , but winter , california , 60 degree weather it took little longer than expected ( 2.5 lbs beef it edible/medium 160 degrees internal 3.5 hours two rather large handfuls apple chips soaked 24 hrs ) . flame blew out three times scared me because i wasn't watching it whole time , when i thought propane exploding upwards ! i didn't think it would go out so easily , so i just ended up feeding it more gas tried cut intensity heat using air intake adjustment . you add more chips get lot smoke flavor so easy , but you lift whole body up off including water pot meat , which could get heavy , but least you keep lid keep some heat there . good thing this design if you doing charcoal , you replace charcoal quickly . overall , i'm very excited , but i those couple gripes ... no door access water pan no way access coals without lifting whole top off no easy way remove propane safety . i love ease gas option you patience saint tend my other charcoal smoker it didn't way get rid ash keep temperature even accessing coal bowl really pain , especially if you wanted add hot glowing charcoal . i'm pleased though ! i got this one my birthday gift myself since i always wanted gas grill instant gratification . i love charcoal briquettes chunks well , so i'm pleased i still option . read owners manual thouroughly before purchasing so you don't any surprises . you also need adjustable wrenches or specific sizes ( i used two crescent adjustable wrenches ) put it together , but it went together fairly intuitively quickly	1
bought this use my weber smokey mountain . i almost bought sunbeam rib rack half price local home improvement chain but it seemed lot flimsier . this rack solid built weber quality . one reason i can't give it 5 stars because sunbeam rack skewers potatoes i would really like see this rack . if ribs too big , i just wrap them around wrap quite easily	1
while we've used coleman folding stoves years , if you trunk space , there no reason earth limit yourself small stove when you grill this wonderful tabletop grill . small tank makes this practical camping . if you want real barbecue while tenting under stars , you camp where tailgate or picnic table available , this great choice camping equipment . we still like coleman boiling water , but i love barbecuing propane grill like this	1
i return my 1st order due mould wood ( around joins ) inside glass front . my replacement little mould inside glass front , but i decided i could live it .. i blame amazon storage this rather than manufacturing it lacrosse . glass front spherical , so tends get weird light reflections , so watch this when you hanging it . note when battery low , second hand move 2 second jumps let you know battery low - this feature , not problem , which i like . other than it works great ! ( i live close boulder nist , where radio signal comes , so also take this into account when ordering any radio controlled clocks ) .	1
pop battery forget it , it sets itself right dot even after daylight savings time came	1
we pleased our recent purchase . we surprised it came through us mail service . it broken part we believe used cord open umbrella .	1
works great my lacrosse weather station . make sure you check compatible models . i two external temperature sensors now ( one outside one my shed ) . only issue you must remove batteries all units , install them back external temp sensors then into main weather station it find both them correctly . this directions course . hope this helps	1
i don ? usually write things like this but mosquitoes magnet i wanted more protection without annoyance refilling carrying propane around not mention cost . every three weeks buy propane bad enough ! i took chance this galaxie product i am glad i its capturing everything yard . it appears works almost well magnet theirs no refilling propane ! if this keeps up i buy two more these units retire magnet . i give this product five stars !	1
bulb seems fine described .. i haven't installed it yet , no bugs yet ..	1
purchased sofa two chairs my backyard i say , they look great . clean lines , good proportions , beautiful chocolatey color . seat cushion bit firm , but probably good help it hold up . i say linen cover bit disappointing fabric bit more like sailcloth then i'd hoped ... but easily recovered , i certainly deal it meantime , especially given great price . only other thing seat quite deep i feel like could used some sort back cushion , but we bought some outdoor throw pillows trick . let hope these pieces hold up , if they , i'd say they great design value	1

i've always felt it probably little unsanitary use aluminum beer inked labeling hot grill . maybe not , but it gives me pause . this device works more stable possibly more healthy alternative bud . it also perfect if you want use other liquids such wine , juice or whatever . only downside clean-up . it consists four parts , each which get coated chicken drippings need some serious scrubbing get off cooked-on residue . i've found dishwasher alone doesn't really remove all it . little scrubbing necessary really get device clean . this certainly useful item us backyard cooks . it little inconvenient compared using beer tossed trash after using	1
i skeptical after reading some reviews this looking price . once i got it lit it , unbelievable . i tendency read reviews pick up others issues products , so there little propane hissing , but heat it puts out unbelievable . flame levels alot higher when you think how much heat flames your grill puts out . handles/footrests heavy duty perfectly placed . saying all , i see only drawback amount fuel you might go through . it says it last 7 hrs , might little generous . i got rave reviews when i started it up , next day when we real fire pit going , everyone appreciated they didn't wash their clothes due smokey smell . best part . aagin , great product	1
other reviews correct . this unit works very well every way , basket mesh kind food holder would good option , use drip pan keep coals off sides , ring riser/extension useful smoking cooking big things , etc . it all good , but there more : who you know who actually charcoal grill rotisserie ? nobody . if you get one , your guests entertained several levels you master . rotisseries professional looking , produces unmatched taste exciting demonstration-style cooking experience everyone . those utilize them seen proficient competent . not bad label you , eh ? might get you somewhere . best meal i ever rotisserie turkey saved me starvation after hike death . perhaps it save you or loved one . rotisserie cooking lends itself acclaimed high heat , short cooking time technique . hot coals self-basting action work well here . one major gourmet magazines cooked turkeys every way known strongly recommended high heat way . this also suggested method cooking heritage meats wild game . starting out 500+ degrees ending something short us government temperature recommendations secret . turkey , example , best taken out heat around 170 , or less , allowed rest . it go up around 10 degrees after . i tie bacon strips onto breast add wet smoking wood chips coals . stuff cavity orange some garlic . other things could used , too . i rotisseried heritage , free range , organic , kosher regular good quality supermart turkeys this high-heat method they all good . governments institutions recommend heat guaranteed kill off any everything , prevent lawsuits course . however , fresh good quality meat not nuked point where you could make furniture out it . use separate thermometer , not supplied pop-out sensor . i am no professional , but i say it produces best tasting food .	1
very easy adapt my grill . looking forward its many us	1

i haven't any problems this clock . it what it supposed , looks pretty good doing it . only reason i didn't give it five stars because i haven't it long ... maybe 3 or 4 weeks . so i'm not sure how it overall durability , but so far so good . dailight savings time coming up , one it first " real " tests . if you're thinking buying it i say go it	1
please remember unseasoned cast iron needs seasoned consumer before first use . it rust if not properly seasoned . season grill press , remove handle unscrewing two screws either end . rinse mild soap water , then thoroughly dry . rub cooking oil over entire surface clean rag or paper towel . place it oven preheated 250 degrees fahrenheit approximately 2 hours . handle care when removing , press quite hot . use hot pad . let grill press cool heat resistant surface , replace handle , then store usual . because cast iron porous , each time you use grill press following initial seasoning more oil seep through foods enforce waterproof oil bond . grill press should not left water not dishwasher safe . rinse press under hot water after each use dry immediately blotting water droplets towel . if directions properly followed , your steven raichlen cast iron grill press should last years .	1
not versatile one we bought over 20 years ago san antonio folk life festival , but every bit well made . original adjustable so you could stretch out better , but this one equally comfortable . this one actually better support bar	1
title says it all - no flimsy board table top , no rickety legs , just sound , reliable folding table	1
i just recieved this mail . setup 15 minutes , but frame metal thin . i am not saying it isn't good unit , but i am afraid it won't last long i intended . burn areas bigger than most i seen , but pan below appears some gaps allowing ambers fall grownd . again , i not used this yet - but expecting it bit tougher frame . i would not pay more than $150 this - hd , lowes other locations provide bit more money what i believe could longer lasting units . overall i am glad i purchased this but learned quality cannont confirmed via picture or desciption . best luck happy burning	1
chair set looks great pretty much put together . instructions ok but could use some more close ups . so here trick i found wasn't mentioned . it best ( only way i could get things connected all ) put " cap " ( like fancy nut flange ) slot first then feed bolt into it . bit information would helped lot . i " " put lots things similar this together so not complete novice . other - bit more major problem - one leg chair appears denser wood or pilot holes not drilled correctly . so no matter what i one side i could not get final screws ( there only four other connectors bolts end caps ) all way came close permanently stipping hex bolts . answer drill longer pilot holes but i need someone drill so it down line . i also agree it not very comfortable without thick cushion like type goes lots outdoor furniture . so good product better than some " put it together yourself " but not perfect . it seems very sturdy but reviewer stated it too soon tell longevity product	1
proof positive you don't hanging under palm tree white sandy beach fully appreciate hammock experience ! these hammocks perhaps most blissful place one rest , it really doesn't matter whether they hung support walls your living room or strung two trees backyard . i spent countless hours perfecting my hammock posture course this perfection test-driven whole bunch hammocks . i , absolute certainty , tell you this hammock stuff dreams made . it constructed durable soft cotton breathes you doesn't cause itchiness or unpleasant quot ; plasticquot ; feeling . when it strung up right , you either lay horizontally or vertically - it matters not because it amazingly comfortable either way . some my most peaceful sleep dreamiest dreams come hammock-induced slumber . i strongly recommend it any everyone considering their sleeping alternatives . hammock isn't banished tropics anymore , fact looks just great my kansas living room . trust me - get little tired get big ole hammock ! this one partiucular make your socks roll up down	1

i love grilling vegetables i quite few grilling baskets different purposes . i got this veggie . size basket good , enough 4 adults . lid flipping narrow side i found it could awkward when you open it try serve food into plates . it just hang i lift basket really high or ask my husband help hold lid . it relatively easy clean . there some hard spots when grid overlaps . again , i wish lid removable rather than fixed narrow end	1

i love this cleaning system . it should called " dust bunnies , gone " . now cleaning service no excuse cobwebs hanging vaulted/cathedral ceilings ! lightweight , solid construction	1
after looking good grill surfing web while , i read reviews this one i thought lets try it . installation this grill really easy , you don't need any specific tool . let me say i didn't any experience grilling but this grill incredible , it holds heat perfectly you wouldn't end up black burned or even raw meat . meat really juicy delicious . i think i got great deal , i even didn't pay shipping !	1
this may called roast holder but you've missed out until you used one cook turkey . you cook up 14 lb . turkey easily 22-1/2 inch grill using this rack . i cooked my first turkey weber 21 years ago cooked least two every year since . there no comparison if you want moist tasty turkey . my family would mutiny if i tried cook turkey any other way my wife loves her oven available fix rest holiday dinner . maybe one day i'll try cook roast but i wouldn't trade this rack any other way cook turkey	1
it very durable grill should last years , if not decades . this size , it strictly grill -- you won't offset-cook this . note : weber grills made used lid , always . if you cook without lid , you lose temperature control , fire often gets too hot you get old burned-on-the-outside-raw-on-the-inside syndrome . lid vents use , webers best charcoal grills temperature control my experience ... although smaller grill , harder it . i think weber still makes slightly larger version smokey joe -- one 18.5 -inch grill . give you lot more flexibility while still very portable . it possible offset-cook chicken two 18.5 -inch grill but probably not this one . finally , this not use your apartment balcony . that illegal most places most assuredly dangerous . even if you concrete balcony , sparks waft away your grill set something else fire	1
this most amazing piece equipment barbequing . everyone should own one . i purchased one my daughter she delighted it . i plan ordering extra one just spare	1
this good addition patio space when umbrella stand needed , design color base blend most newer outdoor furniture . base sturdy solid comes five rubber feet screwed into base added stability leveling uneven surfaces . diameter base stalk holds most patio umbrellas , but sure measure diameter yours first before ordering this size ( 1 3/4 " diameter ) instead larger size available elsewhere . contrary original description this item , however , weight not 70 pounds . it closer 61 pounds without stalk 63 pounds it . ( ups recorded weight 67 pounds , not 73 pounds claimed description . package dimensions also smaller 25 " 25 " 4 " . ) also , diameter not 28 " but 22 " - 23 " , so aware well . description here amazon more accurate , i would rated item higher ..	1
this dandy should available year-round ; it everything it advertised , plus looks great comfy sit , too ! easy assemble ( no tools needed ) . would neat if it available many other solid colors , but cream color nice neutral . its totally waterproof , promised ! it unavailable now , but i would seriously consider buying when it again available ! cattle dogamine also likes sit it	1
i looking grilles over year now , i retire my trusty quickset . all features , size quality , this one cant beat . assembly very extensive , but if you ever put anything together more complicated then pizza box , you put this together . packaging wasnt best , but mine really good shape , so i cant complain much . it looks better , larger cooking area , heats more evenly , heats more quickly , easier clean then my fathers $1400 grille , mine griddle his lacks . if you looking solid all around performer then this grille you . if you dont know how use screwdriver , dont patience assemble anything , then either pay someone it , or chose some thing alittle more basic , like quickset model	1

i bought this grill replace dying charmglow model several years old . it several features my wife i insisted upon our next grill , namely stainless steel grates , 3 burners , stainless steel finish . all all , it marvelously cooking everything we've tried steaks , chicken fish , full 30 lb . turkey . bird came out perfect ! three controls easy use , lower storage compartment roomy , all parts made quality mind . my only complaint arrangement burners , which top bottom ( or , front back , if you prefer ) you face grill . side side arrangement would make indirect cooking much easier rectangular-shaped grill area , where you could one burner off two , still plenty room whatever cooking . assembling it bit chore , took me two my buddies hour half . one note caution : read instuctions carefully pay close attention illustrations !! we didn't , didn't realize our assembly error until we third way though job . no biggie , but this second grill i've put together , they don't get easier . bottom line : weber makes best gas grill this type this price range . i expect it last 10 years care , am very glad i bought it	1
