amazing how writer attempt make immoral organization , corporation , look moral . only someone like al capone could sympathize this group oregon . how anyone justify sort firepower oregon . us apparently willing finance group , but us also financed sadam , noriega , ... unfortunately , this sense it too much like real american policy , which absolutely disgusts me ( ends justify ends no matter how many bodies left behind , long they not righteous americans ) . characters clichï¿½ , there no suspense since everything goes planned , anyone crew just anything , including successful rock band . it makes me look back dirk pitt books wonder dirk morality	-1

this book provides fine introduction myths northern europe . book examines few remnants we forms epic poems prose , written christian writers after fact - eddas , beowulf , viking sagas . these sources , especially edda , author reconstructs myths stories relating norse gods their subsequent twilight ragnarok . then , author seeks answer various questions this myth determine whatever relation it may original religion northern european peoples . figures odin , thor , loki , balder , rest norse gods play important part our european cultural heritage it nice see them presented introduction here . whatever underlying mental constructs behind such accounts ragnarok ( twilight gods ) they certainly appear universal human race , revealed all forms apocalyptic literature . ultimately these beliefs died rather easy death hands christian worldview . whatever your personal opinion replacement pagan beliefs christianity whether or not pagan beliefs should resurrected or remain buried , you certainly profit reading this book it help you better understand northern europe pre-christian times . finally , it must noted many ways , least my opinion , society vikings superior our own . i admire strong sense individualism vikings expressed enjoy greatly reading their heroic feats	1
i like evanovich novels light read few laughs , usually her hero heroine downright combustible - stephanie plum joe morelli relationship , sustained through 12 books so far , case point . but full scoop actually trial get through . i could hear voice there which distracting interrupted evanovich comedic rhythm . whole tone writing down five notches what i come expect evanovich . silly villains either too goofy or too violent , leaving us wondering we supposed amused or frightened ? least forgivable sins committed full scoop fact there absolutely no chemistry maggie zack . none all . so it hard label book : sort but not really romance , almost but not much woman-in-danger .... maybe new genre altogether - slapstick thriller	-1

author great idea , but he cherry-picked available info superman writers get book make sense . example , superman originally written metaphor jews during ww2 . two jewish guys , right end ww2 , write story man leave his homeworld b/c it destroyed ... etc , etc . i'm not critiscizing this book b/c it religious message . i'm critiscizing it b/c author clearly left out clear facts work against his arguement . otherwise , i disagree anybody says it " just comic . " superman often reflected current values attitudes large swath america	-1

casual book browsers who stumble across braden book , " isaiah effect , " might undoubtedly drawn implications title : there exists some mystical , unifying code which only now fully understood through modern techniques , research , understanding . i , one such browser , briefly read so-called " bible code " which computers now enabled man explore thought subject this book might related . my interest piqued title book description , i delved into pages expecting learn exactly what encompassed isaiah " precise instructions " prayer . i wanted know exactly what braden claimed stumbled upon . what i found this 250 page foray into countless subjects nothing other than pastiche new-thought concepts . mixing religions , example - sort pick-and-choose spirituality which slowly creeping its way into mainstream decades - recycled over over again , drawing endless sources gnostic gospels other lost books . only one chapter braden actually begin describe detail verses book isaiah . instead he relegates books essenes positions higher authority prominence . brief pages which braden actually discuss isaiah , his conclusions speak nothing decoded lost science . his basic premise " effect " people alter their futures choices they make present . such revelation not new interpretation isaiah all . any student bible christianity knows all prophetic books old testament records god warning israel , world , turning away him . braden credit , his discussions effects prayer today society commemorable , albeit somewhat misguided . i agree him people today society need turn away petty details life which they've surrounded themselves . however , i believe braden over-emphasizes role feelings emotion prayer . he fails discuss how humans , their emotions , extremly fallable change quickly winds his anecdotes . braden wants desperately believe true power prayer found all lost science which he uncovered ancient texts . process he fails recognize blueprint prayer known man ever since he created . humbleness before god filling holy spirit true keys prayer - not cosmic emotions human feelings . disappointing read	1
refreshing look software development many pitfalls you need avoid . this book should read everybody involved any software project but simplest . my opinion , standard work . nevertheless , it needs handled care . during ages , sw development managers tried convincing their people break out chaos , plan their work . this book correctly warns opposite effects believing planning solves everything . some people might however read lines no planning all best practice . book confirms what i my successful colleagues found through experience intuition : there optimal point planning upfront . less harms because you don't know where you going , more ( too detailed ) harms because it takes away flexibility it slows you down significantly . new me use queuing theory point out what we see every day : too many features , under-resourcing leads far bigger delays than human mind ever guess .	1

aware reviews book displayed not only one edition , but all editions under same title . oxford philosophical texts edition hume " treatise " should standard student edition . prometheus books edition cheap , but it not include modern introduction or any study notes . i recommend oxford philosophical texts version if you want or need more than just raw text	1
it doesn't sound like people you list reasons " not " read this book , actually read " this " book . there big difference , my opinion , putting positive affirmations your mind , versus witch doctor . quite honestly , it seems positive affirmations could should used " conjuction " medical care . it say anywhere book forego medical care , because you most definitely healed ? no where . so my opinion , one " sound " mind , not view book " cure all " all ills life , but rather positive way " enhance " your life . it just plain stupid avoid getting medical care , when you terminal illness , or any other illness matter . but according what i gather book , you use positive affirmations , " believe " you getting well , help keep yourself positive state , rather than filling your head negative thinking you never get well . studies aside this book proven healthy positive attitude mental outlook , wonders recovering patients , their medical care . your review not address any those people read this book , because two examples people you list , it apparent they didn't read book either , ( not sure what compelled you post here ? ) therefore you not qualified , my opinion , critique this book , they using apparently some form faith healing televangelist , they prescribe drinking snakes blood , too ? anyway , this book no way says forgo medical treatment if you sick , those , probably won't addressing their medical problem . positive affirmations power suggestion help you through your medical crisis ? i imagine it , ( studies prove it ) addition proper medical treatment . anyway , you might want actually read book , instead making comments what happened " so so " who didn't even read it or apply it , including yourself .	1
first let it said this book leads you believe he hikes whole trail ... he not . he hikes less than third . you dont find this out until 2/3 through book , which right when book goes passibly bad , ill effort fulfill contract . my conclusion this book he contracted hike trail his publisher , could not , stuffed remainder book verbatum history lessions whole cloth inserts useless statistics . others said this review forum . this book snide , highschoolish down right mean . i fail see " wit " his endless negitivity bashing . this book few funny parts , but i cant help but feel it huge exageration real events , mostly contrived fictional accounts which he uses air nasty comments . it so unbelievible places , you know you imagined tangent . dont waste your money or time . i am so happy i bought it 25 cents yard sale !	-1
i personally not see how this book could won newbery medal . while author portrays sibling rivalry effectively , only positive aspect this book . fact teenage girl protagonist crush elderly man disgusting presented not only acceptable but understandable . sara family also unsupportive her sulky jealous attitudes . her grandmother busybody consantly antagonizes family . sara twin sister gets all attention love , leaving sara starving parental care . finally , christianity portrayed harsh judgemental . this book could possibly acceptable adults but never children i would not recommend it anyone . i wasted my time this book : please don't waste yours .	-1

i didn't especailly high hopes this book . i think there gradual decline quality hh books over years , this one brings it new low . basically , it waaaaaay too long . 850 pages , it monster read , slow one . that not always bad thing - sometimes if you like characters it nice just hang out your friends page after page . but not here . why it necessary describe detail exact movements treecat using sign language ? several paragraphs ? more than once ? why we given pages liturgy religious services ? i think i'd very small minority when i confess i quite like 1662 prayer book , though i can't quite work out why it would revived distant future when it out use here decades ! maybe it easy cut paste , got word count up . then there space combat - strength series , especially first three or four . but there rub - there only so many ways you describe spaceship blowing up . 11th book series i can't only person out there whose eyes beginning glaze over when we get battle sequences . but big problem - spoiler alert ! - way which weber solves love triangle we left last book . honor loves hamish . emily loves hamish . hamish loves honor emily . what ? it turns out there easy solution . after 400 pages agonising ( not mention most previous book ) it seems honor marry them both . bit outre ? seemingly not - apparently such arrangements fall well within accepted norms manticoran law custom . ( although we've never whiff this before . ) but what really gets me reason it didn't happen halfway through last book ( get this ) , gosh , o-o ne thought it . it seems o-o ne ever told mr weber if you shoot someone gun act , gun better hanging wall act i . all-in-all , i only say , please mr weber . it time bring series end . please it soon	-1
