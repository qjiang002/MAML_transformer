leaking , slipping , can't use over kitchen sink . horrible design .	-1
i bought this because i love all other fisher price aquarium stuff we . but ... we haven't thrilled this tub . hammock only used until baby 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child over 9 lbs birth ... so she used it like 2 weeks . even so , hammock sags onto this hard bump middle hammock so baby back rests this bump . never seemed comfortable . then we used it hammock attached only top like instructions say but our daughter outgrew infant side because her butt would slide right over bump supposed support her but she can't sit up use other side . there better tubs out there	-1
i bought this chair because great reviews , i hesitated spending so much , but figured all features would worth it considering my son would using it couple years . pros : i like i roll it around table , or sink clean up after meals . height adjustment easy convenient . cons : folding it up didn't quite work i thought it would . it didn't lock into folding postition ... didn't really save much space . i would prop it against wall , hope no one knocked it down . we finally stopped folding it up . toys connect tray too dangerous my son , he would usually hit himself face them when he younger , time he older , i didn't really need them . battery operated toy funny smell it whenever it running while . he like it ... but buttons too hard him press when he younger . my son discovered 7 months how pull off extra tray go into dishwasher , so we don't use . he 13 months now , last week discovered how disconnect tray itself fling it off high chair . i washed seat cover per instructions , half time not use dryer , even though it said it could go into dryer , now seat bubling cracking ... i place cloth diaper seat protect my son legs . if i not spent $90.00 chair i would not disappointed ... but he only used it 7 months .	-1
we nothing but problems receiver . we it our kitchen it no more than 30 feet our son bedroom . any time we walk near receiver it beeps loss signal . beep very annoying because it won't stop until you move out way . if we open fridge door it beeps also . we've tried all frequency combinations no luck . it also very subsceptible interference makes loud crackling sounds , even low volume , until you change frequency . when it works sound quality very good , although it hard lower volume enough so night you not awakened your child simply rolling over or babbling their sleep . we recommend angelcare movement sensor monitor bebe sounds . sound quality great it comes sensor pad you place under your baby mattress . it senses each time your baby takes breath . if there no movement it sounds alarm . great insurance against sids !	-1
alas , we entire locomotion set but cute little mobile won't fit our sleigh-style crib . i called babies us see some sort conversion kit , but there no such thing . i'll returning it this weekend getting some crib toys instead . : -	-1

i wore baby plus my first pregnancy . i say our child bright , out-going 8 month old now , but beginning she colicky terrible napper ! i thought this brilliant idea , but began realize many bright , gifted children i know didn't exposure this system . it loud wear not so comfortable . you instructed wear it hour time quite maddening . good luck if you choose purchase , but just think , einstein fine out one	-1
leak-o-matic fully lived up its name . new parent , i don't time things once , forget doing things twice . i need simple reliable- leak-o-matic neither . it worked ok first few times , then i partially filled tub put all items nearby necessary bathtime . time i returned baby hand , leak-o-matic dribbled all over laundry room counter , soaked all my other items counter , water ran down onto floor , under baseboard , dripped upstairs landing onto downstairs foyer floor . leak-o-matic hindenburg all baby bathtubs . it too bad i cannot give it zero stars . there many people who say you just assemble them correctly , but judging number irate mommies here , i conclude it either too complicated design or just plain crappy engineering . think it- number people young children who took time go online tell everyone this thing piece cheese ! cups feet stick countertop so you unable positon tub once it attached . fabric mesh incline allows baby slide down into water , so you're always repositioning baby . i'm surprised this thing didn't come built toaster ' added safety ' . i not research every single item registry- i figured if big stores carried it then it must least " ok " . back it goes . if you buy this thing , then good luck you , don't burn toast !	-1
i bought this item my daughter it not worth money . items cheap plastic some even cardboard . this would great deal if offered dollar store . pass	-1
my almost- 3 yr old daughter needed new umbrella stroller ( she tall , but still gets tired sometimes , especially if i take her shopping ) . i researched options picked maclaren volo . my first stroller before it chicco capri , it always bumped against my legs , which annoying uncomfortable . when canopy broke , i got rid it decided buying new one plane travel local outings . volo seemed great - light , handsome , convenient , highly rated parents . i ordered stroller , upon unpacking it , quite pleased its appearance . i read instructions learned use it . stroller seemed sturdy , well-made , easy maneuver , not mention chic . washable seat good idea , i thought . i liked how large it ( perfect older child ) , how easily it moved . when i took new volo around block , i noticed one double back wheels not aligned properly ( one higher than other not rotate , which caused stroller make scraping sound ) . then other set stopped rotating when one (!) pine needle got stuck it ! i carefully remove it my hands middle street . needless say , that not quality i expected , since every parent i know raved maclaren . canopy kept sliding off rails , well - something you would not want airport , your toddler luggage car seat tow . when i got home , i looked wheels closely tried adjust them , but no avail . they flimsy ( i could dent them my finger if i wanted ! ) , way too small just poorly designed . i immediately packed up stroller returned it amazon . i very disappointed . one would think such high price , wheels would usable - after all , they most important feature any stroller . i stay chicco order c6 . least i know wheels great , you can't beat price	-1
i bought this seat my fifth child . she loved it first , but then second week we it , plastic top one legs snapped i putting her it . luckily i not let go her yet , because whole thing fell apart floor . rattle ball also broke off within first couple weeks . upon investigation , company only offers 15 day warranty not cover " material failure " . i not buy anything else this company . not only their products poor they down right dangerous	-1
all things we heard it suffocation hazard later age , it actually potential even very beginning . our little one actually used slide down it night progressed , leaving her wedges time she would wake . we tried tightening it her much possible , she still scooted down it . after few too many attempts this we stopped using it altogether . maybe our baby just too squiggly , but honestly i just found it dangerous . i think it great idea , but product needs some work .	-1
i read several reviews this site choose new mattress my babies room . i great crib usa baby i noticed how first review stated she didn't buy super expensive mattress usa baby ( 160.00 ) which i my first baby it great . it super snug fit crib now her toddler bed it still perfect fit . i decided this baby i didn't want spend much mattress because it seem silly . however , this mattress didn't fit snug my crib nor it firm feel . this medium quality mattress medium price . i bought it yesterday took it back today . i am going go expensive mattress i know fits perfect long term use .	-1
this monitor awful . i it 5 months it only worked properly 1 . it makes loud beeping noises oddest times , like 2 am !!! not buy this monitor . onlt thing it going it nice looking !!!	-1
this worst monitor we ever , we several our kids . it says range 600 feet , but it doesn't even reach 200 . our cordless phone reaches twice distance . light makes it very annoying night . it beeps loudly no reason cuts out frequently !	-1
i agree rebecca -- bravados more simple , more flexible , more comfortable	-1
i like idea all this one case ( it hard complain this price ) , but some these things would better bought separately . we've either traded up or found substitute most things here . here what i found : item #1 ) case fine , but things fall out all time . #2 ) i haven't used tweezers yet , but magnifying part sounds nice . #3 ) nail clippers way too sharp . we cut my daughter skin more than once ( but one serious enough we considered hospital trip ! ) now we use my regular clippers , i haven't gotten her skin since . soft grip thing actually make them slide around more , so it tougher cut where you wanted . trust me , it easy clip skin fingers little ! #4 -7 ) emery boards very handy , but any emery boards would work . #8 ) we got different thermometer ; this one too slow . faster ones more expensive , but they're worth it sick squirmy baby . #9 ) i haven't used medicine dropper , but one time she need one , i actually asked pharmacy desk grocery store , they gave me one free ( then later i found out we this one . ) #10 -11 ) brush comb nice . i'm sure they purchased separately kit less . #12 ) my daughter only 7 months old , no need toothbrush awhile , since there no teeth ( even when there , i believe you wipe them gauze , not toothbrush awhile . ) basically , although this kit tons things could helpful it wasn't very expensive , we either gotten upgrade things we use ( thermometer ) , or found other things would work just well ( regular nail clippers , free medicine dropper . ) i'm certainly not saying you shouldn't get one , because i'd hate say then you find you needed it . if you get it shower gift , great ; if not , you find substitute items just easily	-1
nail clippers , hairbrush , comb great but i not care rest . it would cost effective buy items seperately this company	-1
this only gate market i could find would fit 12 foot doorway my livingroom dining area . it stated easy install but when screws kept breaking off inside my new woodwork i kept redrill holes i bit angry !!!! i suggest predrilling your holes !!! hinges also won't stay swinging gate doesn't line up . you need 2 hands close gate which busy mom 5 children you don't always 2 hands free ! end installing this gate it throw out	-1
this one those products good theory but not practice . i thought , " ooh what nifty idea , head bumper ! " whole idea great ; but if your baby wiggle worm like mine , then head bumper guard waste . i actually found this item more hazard than anything . because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up his arm stuck under side guards wrapped semicircle around bumpers . don't ask me how he this . good thing if he wet through his diaper pad underneath absorbed urine . other than it hassle keep crib	-1
i thought tiny love products good , so i bought this . first one i received water leaking out . second one doesn't make bubbles after few days music already sounds like battery dying . my baby seems like it , but it not live up what it advertises	-1
if your baby fingers or teeth this not trap . they easily take lid off scatter snacks glee .	-1
i bought two my kids ' seats . they constantly bunch up slip around . now i lose money shipping send them back refund . don't bother these . just fold up towel . it cheaper just convenient these things	-1
i don't care what other reviewers say , but this bed rail sucked !! i used it my sons toddler bed since it seemed only product would accomodate type bed . it took up so much mattress space my son barely room sleep his bed . it would constantly come unlocked . if i buy bed rail our next child it won't mesh one cause they get too dirty . i can't remember if this cover removable or not , if it i'm sure it would pain ** remove	-1
just note thank all parents who take time post their opinions ... i find " customer reviews " tremendous help when trying make decisions " grandma " needs ! i also advised my pregnant daughter check them out before making final decision anything ! thanks all you again !	-1

i researched many car seats settled this one . safe cute ! but it * major * flaw : strap comes up legs too close back seat . my daughter , only five months old , already almost sitting * * belt where it comes out . this mean buckle way too low tight , forcing belts cut into her chunky thighs pushing uncomfortably her pubic bone . i asked around online some forums , found many other mothers who returned this seat same reasons . many mothers didn't find it problem until their child least 20 lbs , but it problem me already , because we use cloth diapers , so my baby butt bigger due ' padding . ' this car seat wouldn't work well if your child chunky or uses cloth diapers ... even otherwise , i can't see how it would work child over 25 lbs or so ... britax roundabout croth belt different location , few inches further out back seat , so it one i am getting replacement	-1
i love this product fleece , but this so light-weight . it defeats purpose	-1
i loved this mattress pad when i first opened it , it made soft , natural cotton offers nice cushion baby . however , after washing it , i found it too small crib mattress , which standard size . i think they just skimped material , or didn't pre-wash . it good 2 inches too short ! it doesn't much stretch it , so i'm afraid i won't able use it all ! very disappointing	-1
tubbly bath dispenser fit our spout just fine , but minutes later it would work itself off . we tried everything get it work no luck . fortunately , company sells it agreed let us return it weeks later without receipt or packaging . don't even try it ... it not worth it ! look something else . there other faucet covers out there	-1

i think i've tried every bag i found disappointed all them . these just worst !! my daughter born prematurely never really got hang breastfeeding . i wanted her recieve all benefits breastmilk so i pumped . i pumped everday since day she born btwn 5 8 times day . i went through alot bags ( i use bottles now ) these pain . they small , thin , punctured easily , those twist ties ( although pumping directly into bag great concept ) just pain butt . i love medela pumps ( i own pump style advanced , seperate manual pump , used lactina hospital pump 3 months ) , i like their storage bottles , i even like their nipple cream , but these bags need some more work put into them	-1
idea behind these bags great - you pump straight into bag store them . execution , however , lousy . using twisties seal bags cumbersome annoying . i prefer lansinoh bags double seal . even though you can't pump straight into them , sealing them quick easy	-1
i started using these cloth diapering my first child . they hold plenty held up pretty well . ones i havn't bleeched still going strong after 6 years ! these aren't great chinese prefolds but then again they little bit cheaper , trimmer you get them when you need them rather than wait week them arrive mail . these best diapers sold stores	-1

warmer made such loud beep when it completed its task it woke our baby up . so much so we ended up staying near it shut it off before it went beeping ! also physically pull out power cord after each use it no auto shut off . [ ...	-1
i purchased this swing because we out town it much needed . we full sized papasan swing travel ocean wonders swings home ( which retrospect , we wishing we brought us ) . while neither those 100% perfect , they much better than this one . open frame allows child kick swing frame , stop swing moving , potentially get their feet/legs stuck bars . also , swing seat almost lays horizontal ( foot part swing much higher than head position)while swinging , point i am afraid if my daughter would wiggle bit , she would end up tipping seat backwards land floor . lastly , mobile horrible . it pitiful i find it hard believe fisher price put something like market . it plastic leaf little notches two toys strings . strings not end them you slide it into notches . these toys remain notches approximately 3 seconds . it very poor design needs lot work . my daughter ends up crumbled up ball one side swing more times than not - it doesn't seem support our other 2 swings . said , swing very attractive appealing . i only wish it better made more thought out .	-1
this not fold down 90 deg . don't buy if you think you'll able fold down change sheets or something	-1
i bought this thermometer when my second son born , thinking it would easy use good money . my husband i tested it ourselves see how accurate it . we both got 5 different readings . i didn't see what need plastic covers , since we ran out them quickly . ( not mention , you can't find replacements anywhere . ) my biggest complant after month , product completely stopped working , even after changing batteries . i would suggest paying extra money get better thermometer	-1
i bought this thermometer my daughter when she first born . it awful ! it gives strange readings like 94.5 95.1 , when fact i know she fever ! i bought just regular digital rectal thermometer pharmacy it gives more accurate readings . don't buy this , its waste time $$$$$$	-1
i excited when i purchased this ear thermometer because i ear thermometer years ago i loved . i unfortunately very disappointed this one performance . temperature seemed innaccurate when we testing it right after purchase . then two weeks ago my daughter came down fever . i could feel she burning up , but ear thermometer read 97.5 when i checked it ( twice ) . i got out oral thermometer discovered her fever actually 102.1 !!! needless say this thermometer went back store . i won't buy ear thermometer until i afford get better brand , like one i years ago ( thermoscan ) . :o	-1
i bought this older model graco pack ' play we got friends who no longer needed it . mattress measures 27 " 39 " before washing it my husband i tried it out see if it fit . it too small . i know it supposed snug but mattress won't even lay flat this sheet it . it seems like it'd great product , if only it slightly bigger fit properly .	-1
biggest disappointment after 6 months , tub began leaking air through unseen hole- maybe seams ( thus patch would not work ) . kel-gar not warranty product , store tub came ( via amazon ) only offered 90 day warranty . also , tub too wide fit standard tub- only half water tub spout lands tub , rest flows behind it . thus wasted water it takes longer fill	-1

my husband i purchased this warmer gift cards we received our second baby birth . we don't really like it . our wipes dry out down third , sometimes fourth wipe . that makes 6-8 wipe diaper change ! ( that lot wasted money ) other reviewers right wipes staying moist when it not full . but newborn , infant or even toddler i prefer convenience opening refill pack placing all wipes into warmer instead half wipes then finding something keep second half moist until it time refill other half . we wrap-around warmer our first child . it wore out around time we started potty training her . that style wipe warmer i would recommend new parents , not this one	-1
buy anything . buy regular old trash throw your diapers there because you'll get pretty much same end result . i don't pink diaper champ because i little boy but it still diaper champ it horrible . i diaper genie my older son ( now 4 ) gave it my brother . i wanted try something else drawn champ because you use kitchen trash bag .... woo hoo ... no refills !!! so three months now ( that how old my little butterball now ) i've used diaper champ first day it not so bad ( maybe because diapers floating enormous amount lysol i spray there fact i use forceflex trash bags ( prayer they won't break when i'm disposing diapers flood house old baby poop ) which also odor shield ( so bags start out smelling so nice ! ) but already day two , my husband walking nursery saying " hoooooooney , it smellllllls ! i clean thing all time .... stench remains . this week i ordered my diaper genie online . i feel like throwing party when it gets here . i'll spend extra few dollars some refills if it keeps guests enter my home wondering what earth died my house .	-1

good things : ( 1 ) baby loves watching hanging toys . ( 2 ) nature sounds very well very pleasant . bad things : ( 1 ) very troublesome assemble . supplied screws cheap metal they screwed into plastic threads . most critical support structure ( kickstand ) i could not get all screws into their holes completely before screws stripped out . but i get it together well enough use . however , i considered returning it store during assembly . ( 2 ) vibration feature broke after 1 month use . ( 3 ) baby cannot reach toys , even 3 months age , we very tall baby . ( 4 ) toys very easily removed their " holes " so you can't really move chair without toys falling out . ( 5 ) rocker very big " footprint " . it takes up half surface area our four-seat kitchen table	-1
we bought this car seat ( snap ' go ) based good reviews ( not ones listed here ) . it not meet our expectations . i give it 2 stars just safety it . otherwise , i hard time finding positive things say . it way too heavy . our baby 7 lbs+ his early days , it heavy carry around . now he almost 20 pounds 5+ months , it nearly impossible carry him any length time . adjustable strap often gets stuck we really tug make it work . most grocery carts it too big it face towards you you shop . when you clip it cart , front end suspended air . i just put it sideways which pain . also , handle bar built easier carry ... i don't agree . it still awkward- i end up hooking it under my arm . lastly , put handle bar up down very difficult . you squeeze taps both sides really push hard get it release . i'm sorry i don't any others recommend . i hoped like this am just suffering until he doesn't need support grocery car t---t hat really only reason i still use it	-1
we got this lieu similar one because it stock , but lo behold it only lasted week . our son lays his back kicks everything his crib , so when he kicked this , knob securing it crib through strap broke off . luckily broken piece fell floor not into his crib , where it could posed choking hazard ! pass this get fisher price one - ocean wonders or one we got , flutterbye dreams , which he loves	-1
i recently purchased two these sheets ended up taking them right back . they say they're fitted but they aren't elastic so they're not well fitted . they paper thin . apparently graco hasn't put these their pack plays observed quality ! i purchased koala portable sheets which cheaper , thicker , truly fitted elastic ! don't waste your money these	-1

i used this tub my first born . this small holds very little water , therefore , water gets cold fast ! also , there holes where tub folds up so water spills out holes baby moves . it messy if you giving your baby bath floor i . our baby would stick her foot leg out tub because it so small ... when i used larger tub , didn't happen . one positive thing i say this product it compact ... i kept it my mother house it didn't take up much space . i would recommend spending extra $10 $15 buy higher quality tub .	-1
this tub great beginning - it fit perfectly our kitchen sink we able bathe our baby no problems all . it great she could sit warm water not get cold while i washing her , etc . however , after using tub 10 times , it suddenly collapsed into bottom sink my baby inside . basically , top bottom ends fold up storage just buckled . she wasn't hurt , but very scared . keep mind this problem started when my baby 12 lbs - so i don't think her weight issue	-1
not believe manufactures claims you don't need jacket if you this bunting . we 7am enfant bunting our daughter her first winter loved it . it hood ( could unzipped ) completely covered her up kept her toasty warm without any extra clothing . now she outgrown it i bought one these replacemen t.t here no way any stretch anyones imagination you use this bunting without needing coat hat well . zip only zips half way up chest my one year old . yes you could pull up flap cover her chest but she just pushes it down again since there no way keep it up ! it keep her just warm enough coat , hat mittens temp 35f , but i want something you use without coat . after much research i am returning this ( after single outing ) getting little kazook instead ( which zips all way up hood )	-1

we diaper dekor plus it seems i'm only reviewer here so far terrible problem it bad smell . first couple months weren't bad , but after 3 months or so , it really started smell bad . this horrid smell only got worse use time went . we tried everything we could think get rid smell-letting it " air out " outside , cleaning it bleach or some other cleaning solution , putting baking soda bottom liner even leaving small box baking soda inside but outside liner , letting it soak bathtub soap water ... we even bought some scented disc type things ( purchased babies us ) you put bottom it only made smell worse . we continued use it , but frequently let it air out or spray it lysol or something . eventually we used it less less , we just threw it away when we moved new home few weeks ago-we'd it almost 2 years . we knew there no way anyone else would want use it smell knowing they couldn't get rid it . it real shame because aside smell , it great product	-1
our pursuit ultimate baby items , infant carseat topped our list . what more important than safety your first child , especially so unpredicatable situation driving ? our search led us this graco carseat , we added it our wish list recieved it christmas gift , just before our daughter birth january . seat fairly attractive , but its good points stop there . it bear install . not because it complicated , but rather because you need extraordinarily strong man ( or woman , unlike myself certainly ) install base . we ended up taking it inspector who spent 5 minutes tugging belts all his might , then huffed puffed told us " should there real good , now . " we examined it , asked why seat still able flip up toward back car , he replied , " oh they all , that normal . " unsure , but safety rating back it , we continued use it . throughout her first 7 months it cumbersome piece equipment . lots bumping banging it get it into car baby already seat ( we 3 4-door sedans , 1992 subaru legacy , 80-something oldsmobile , my mom 2006 saturn ion . seat already car , it struggle get baby without bumping her head or catching her legs sides least once - me . my husband simply can't put her carseat already car . not mention , seat - while installed car - never felt especially stable , exception my mom ion , which latch system . course , drawback ion my 6'1 " husband barely fit into front seat because carseat so large cumbersome he cannot move his seat back so he sort smashed into dashboard . then , past week seat begun fall over while we're driving . literally , go around curve , look back , her seat 45 degree angle backseat car . my daughter 8.5 months old still falls bit below weight height limits seat . we've checked belts secure seat , pulled all our might , seat continues malfuction . this safety issue if i've ever seen one . enough force , she could end up directly her side , say force side impact accident . upon closer inspection , i shouldn't altogether shocked . base seat proportionately much smaller than top where baby sits . sort like wine glass , i suppose - so it top heavy , likely heavier load top , greater likelihood it topple slightest provocation . needless say , we'll begin shopping new seat immediately . snugride , i would recommend parents think twice before purchasing it . i'd certainly never consider it older vehicle without latch system , i'd still take it trial run newer one latch system . hindsight i wish i shopped around bit more .	-1
these complete waste money . nipples flow too fast newborn . i tried using them many times during my return work transition my daughter choked cried during each feeding . she also swallowed so much air-i burping her what seemed hours . bottles too expensive just storage-you purchase generic breastmilk storage bottles made evenflow $3.99 ... personally i like use storage bags laid flat my freezer , they take up less space	-1
i bought this my daughter while i still pregnant , thinking it would helpful thru first few months ( well later ) terms able keep up my daily chores my 2 1/2 y.o. son . it certainly wasn't cheap , so i assumed it would good product , appeared safe comfortable younger infants . don't let product description fool you ! just it says some other reviews , it very possible your child fall when this sling , because it crappy strap tightener . my daughter small newborn , only weighing 8lbs nearly 2 months , which first time i tried using sling . even small , 2 minutes i sling i could already tell strap starting loosen . ( definitely not safe ! ) aside , this item so big bulky i literally could not even see my daughter it . i might well just put duffel bag over my shoulder plopped her into it . there wouldn't much difference two . i would strongly advise you not purchase this product ! i want get rid mine , since it brand new , but i threw away box so i can't return it . i absolutely cannot , good concience , sell it anyone else their child . so , i no choice but just bite my tongue throw product trash . don't make same mistake i !	-1
i've owned my diaper dekor plus just under 2 years . first , i thought it worked fine . it easy deal , easy empty . first liner it came lasted me 6 months ( 1 baby - using newborn diapers through size 2 ) . however , unit failed control odors after 9 months . since then i've hide it various places my home keep odor minimum . definitely not convenien t.t he unit one particularly fundamental flaw regarding odor control . unlike diaper champ which allows you deposit diaper without opening container letting odors escape , diaper dekor no such provision . it two " trap doors " allow you drop diaper easily , then they supposed spring back into place . still , no matter how quickly you drop diaper , let top lid fall closed , strong odors inevitably escape . also , these " trap doors " quite flimsy . hinge one them recently broke so door no longer springs back into its closed position , thereby contributing odor problem . i inquired replacement regal lager they said i could purchase one $10 . instead i decided purchase new diaper champ , since i've pretty much it this thing . speaking flimsy , there two other flaws i've experienced . firstly , plastic foot pedal cracked seems loose . it still works , but i wonder how much longer . also , door bottom unit enables you cut off bag remove it not close very tightly , once again contributing lack odor control . door only held shut small plastic latch , leaving significant gap odors escape . overall , i not impressed diaper dekor plus . however , contrary what some people say regarding liner refills , actually never one my bigger complaints . i not find them cost-prohibitive all , because you get 3 liners $20 i found 3 liners last me 6 months holding toddler-size diapers . 1 year 9 months i've owned this system , i've only purchase refills twice . only thing i didn't like it i find it inconvenient purchase liners online ( couldn't find any local store carried them ) wait them shipped me , especially when there no indication when you reach end your last liner . diaper dekor only system i used extensively , i would not buy it again nor recommend it anyone . i'm hoping my diaper champ serve me better	-1

i purchased this sterilizer based recommendation friend . after just few uses , steamer stopped working . when lever turn steamer pushed , it just wouldn't turn any more . i contacted first years manufacturer , say least , they excellent customer service . they no problem replacing unit . upon receiving second unit , i used steamer once . because steamer couldn't hold every thing first run i run it twice row . my disappointment , i pressed lever again it not work . frustratingly , i pushed lever several times then light finally came . unless you cool it half hour or more , this how my unit operated . i'm sure not every one experience same but this how mine . i definitely would caution buyers product - only because this problem occured twice units i used .	-1

i safari tt dbl jogger step i bought this shade because shade stroller non-existent . i seen this product work well single strollers , but it keeps blowing up back my canopy slighest breezes , so it not doing such great job keeping sun off my kid faces . i've used binder clip keep it place , but it still blows back more than i think it should ..	-1

we bought this thinking our son would love neaty gadgets sounds ... we several major issues it . 1 ) pee guard . it doesn't really latch stay . our son irritated pee guard we he first learning kept ripping it off seat then throwing it accross room . luck would it , when i would go retrieve item , he would pee since there no guard , pee would go everywhere but seat/ pot . resolve this i use special adhesive plastics ( super glue didn't work all ) which took 24 hours set which interuppted our potty training . it also turned part seat yellow which made it look dirty even when it not . but i no choice- guard stay . 2 ) sensors too sensitive would go off even when he nothing . he could just sdjust his position seat it would tell him he great job going potty even though he never went . 3 ) sounds gadgets too distracting . he wanted play them would turn around seat this would sometimes when he pee it would end up all over me/ floor/ whatever nearby . i finally just took batteries out told him it broken . 4 ) when he ready use actual potty , we took it apart per direction placed it top one our toilet seats . everytime he pees i hold down his " bits " because seat not go all way down make seal potty seat toilet seat , thus it leaks out under potty seat onto toilet seat then down front toilet onto his pants/ underware/ etc . pee guard useless this feature . sometimes even when i hold his stuff down , if he wiggles or moves , then he not position ... there only one position he or it go all over seat down toilet onto his clothes . it most expensive toilet seat available store . we thought we would getting top quality seat begining end our son potty training experience . price what motivated me try make it work us . finally , i threw darned thing garbage just got circo toilet seat pee guard toilets . it least expensive toilet adapter it turned out best . if we child , i am going get basic toilet seat/ no frills inexpensive toilet adapter . both together fraction what we paid this seat would million times less aggrevating . don't waste your money	-1
i bought this stroller my daughter , thinking we could transition into it around 6 months . she hated it . stroller lacked back support she would slide down seat . she would cry within five minutes riding stroller . after several months use , wheel fell off . also , stroller hard stear . you need both arms stroller push . if you try guide it one hand then it goes direction . even now she 16 months old able support her own body , she prefers other strollers . i bought cheap stroller wal-mart ten times more satisfied . this stroller recommended my brother who twins uses aria tandam , which i assume better . i would not recommend it consumer	-1
when we first received this stroller , we loved it ! it handled well -- very smooth , easy turns , could directed one hand . my one complaint handle too short someone longer legs . but we started using it more more , we found it not very " user-friendly . " one , way it opened not intuitive . we push it out forward while pulling up levers each side handle bar . forget trying this while holding baby . also , canopy too small doesn't meet baby carrier canopy when used travel system . result , keep sun off baby , we needed extra blanket . these minor inconveniences , but real trouble started when my son outgrew baby carrier began riding stroller solo . we quickly realized how stupidly designed harness straps . they simply slid into clip back support , so my active son could easily move forward unclip straps . he still held harness , but he able move little too freely could easily lean over or forward grab wheels . too , after year half daily use , handling deteriorated . wheels stick when climbing hills when turning i constantly backtrack get them realigned .	-1

some assembly required . i consider myself fairly skilled assmebling things ... i engineering degree ... i've put together bikes , furniture , installed car stereos , this thing absolute pain , especially such simple device . i found instructions woefully inadequate . i found images useless , instructions leave out fairly critical steps - like how orient various pieces together . takes 10 times longer install then it would if they taken effort provide more guidance . it aggravating enough make me go straight amazon upon finishing leave feedback ... i didn't even buy it amazon . gate itself fine	-1

heed bad reviews . i think problem may medela definition " occasional use . " i used this pump once every other day or two month half -- apparently deemed more than occasional , because pump yields very little now ... half what it used . so this yet review leads same conclusion : i should gotten different pump	-1

i bought this chair because it got such good reviews looks great . i so sick seeing fish , butterflies primary colors all over our house - neutral tones sight sore eyes ! but i've so disappointed this chair function . all nooks crannies buckles straps , it impossible keep clean . straps parts vinyl seat became so caked food i threw them into washing machine - even though tags says not . worst part seat tray . it ridiculously wide -- too big my dishwasher my kitchen sink ! ( both full sized . ) way my toddler smears food tray , there no way i could just wipe it rag it . washing it turns into exercise hosing down my countertops sink sprayer . oh well , least they get clean too ... also , i agree other reviewers it really difficult slide tray into place . i wind up shaking it around my poor toddler looks me like i'm torturing him . bright side , recline feature wonderful infants babies who just getting hang sitting up . overall , if i it over again i'd pick simple fisher price ..	-1

i registered these bottles i am new mom thought variety great . we used stage one nipple my son able suck down his formula no problem infact way quick . he would struggle feeding time . he so gassy horrible reflux , during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body cry . i recommendation switch dr. brown bottles which made huge diffrence . however , he still spiting up still little gassy just not bad it managable , their stage 1 nipples small stage two big . we gone camping trip i bought playtex disposable bottles easier cleaning . i also some research these bottles found several people liked them better then dr. brown . so i tried them my son doing much better he dosen't even spit up anymore . so if you like ventair i think you would like disposable much better . my sons dr. wanted put him antacid but i not comfortable giving him medication such young age i wanted see if i could solve problem , which i completly playtex disposable bottles !	-1

i really thought these cutest bumper pads , but after hearing over over again how you shouldn't use bumper pads because risk suffication , i decided it wouldn't worth risk put them crib . i don't think there enough ties them hold them securely one , even if there i wouldn't comfortable thought my daughter getting her head caught up under them . she able scoot across her crib since she newborn so there never ideal time use these . again , cute nursery set up pre-baby , but i wouldn't use afterwards	-1

we bought this product based its testimonials thought it would best choice our new baby . while he no problems using playtex nursers , he ended up problem dr. brown natural flow bottles . first off , they pain clean . each piece needs painstakenly washed ( boiling nipple , washing bottle , scrubbing each hole insert reservoir . ) it certainly laborsome time consuming . anyhow , when he uses them , he spits up where he didn't competition . i tried figure out why . if you tip bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking . so my baby not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product . he lets it build up his mouth then ends up push it out when he gotten too much . needless say , we planning return these stick playtex	-1
definately not potty boys . other reviewers , shield not stay . looking simple basic potty now :o	-1

when my daughter tiny , she enjoyed this sling ... one or two occasions i managed endure discomfort wearing it more than two minutes . cotton fabric doesn't offer much support baby weight i found it became uncomfortable very quickly . it also didn't feel secure some padded , over-the-shoulder style slings . i actually afraid not keep arm my baby all times , which defeats purpose .	-1

i very excited get these bowls mail because they so cute , concept suction bowl ( ) appealing me . my son loved bowl right away , he able reach into bowl some puffs feed himself instead push puffs around table until he could finally grab one his fingers . i'd also like add he ate tofu cubes first time out this bowl loved them ! however , i'm disappointed because suction bowl not work more than few seconds . i'm constantly pushing bowl back down , which disruptive his meal . despite some happy memories i've this bowl , i would not recommend buying these bowls because ' suction bowls ' they not serve their purpose	-1
what if you just bought this product : go outside bang your head hard you against side your house --- maybe knock some sense into you after you've gone looney trying use this piece junk !!! many reviewers noted , it extremely difficult get this bottle warmer work properly . first off , little vials you use measure water into poorly marked -- why they choose use teeny-tiny white lettering ? stupid ! it then very tricky get proper amount water into vials . fact difference say , level 2 level 3 maybe two drops water ! trying doing out standard faucet . fact we use filtered water faucet ( thin spout ) it still hard get write . but that easy compared figuring out right water-in-the-vial formula-in-the bottle ratio ! we currently using 4oz playtex bottle ( disposable bags ) contantly playing guessing game right amount water use . level 3 --- still cold , but wait , last night same amount water practically scalded formula ! just try use vented-type bottle ... forget it ! how 8oz . bottle ? no way ! either way cold or way hot . even though we use filtered water , this thing still need cleaned vinegar ( recommended ) evey week or so . however , cleaning barely hepls after less than 8 weeks use we now use microwave more more . why ? because we know 4oz . formula always need 6-7 seconds microwave ... every time	-1
i bought this car seat based good ratings it received . however , it not work my son until he 5 months old . my son born 5 lb . 11 oz . he not fit snugly into this seat , even head cushion . his head rolled around or rolled forward . i tried put washcloths or towels around but it not work . also , if i adjust base so car seat flatter , it would roll around lot more ( i leather seats ) . additionally , material seat not breathable -- it velvety -- so my son back head would become very sweaty longer trips , even winter . i would say once my son bigger ( 14 pounds 26 inches ) , i removed head cushion moved seat belt higher position -- this when he actually " fit " into seat , however fabric still issue his back head still become very sweaty , making him very uncomfortable longer trips .	-1
i bought this doll because expensive price , i figured it would best . it definitely not . patty cute , but only good thing her . fill up her bottles , you must squeeze insert into glass water , then squeeze again until water shoots out then reinsert into glass water again . it requires it such particular way only adult fill bottles water , no small child able master precise way it takes . then , feed patty you must hold her very still exact angle , where she almost standing up . most children cradle their baby dolls their arms , but patty not drink position . even standing up position , most water spills out tiny hole her mouth soaks her outfit . it takes 5-10 minutes fill patty up . most children don't patience this lose interest , my daughter . plus since she perfectly still exact angle , only adult feed patty her water . then , make her pee , you must press her thigh very hard . this distressed my daughter because she thought i hurting patty . once i assured her patty ok , then she upset because she not strong enough press hard enough make patty pee . my daughter 35 months old lot children start training earlier . 35 months old , my daughter not able fill bottles , feed patty or make her pee . only adult these things due complexity bottles feeding peeing systems patty . so my daughter quickly lost interest patty started squirting water all over bathroom instead bottles . whole " teach doll pee " part potty training lost . i wish i gone store bought cheap wetting doll instead . then i e-mailed company complain , but course received no response . you can't get full refund if doll used . fact , getting refund all extremely difficult , i just given up . don't waste your money . this doll too expensive cannot used child , which defeats whole purpose . go your toy store buy cheap wetting doll . least way , if you don't like it you return it , unlike patty	-1
these come both boy girl colors . picture shows pink , purple , yellow bottles . i received blue green bottles . i contacted amazon who promptly sent me three sets ( all first three sets wrong ) . second shipment they only got one set right . i e-mailed return these well . when i sent back five incorrect sets company would not refund my money because " they already replaced items " . careful when ordering this site	-1
i bought this after renting hospital-grade medela lactima . big difference . backpack compact , sleek , inconspicuous but pump sucks . it one adjustment speed/suction computer chip selects best combination two you . well , after few pumps my nipples fall off . if i lower suction comfortable , reasonable level , pump way too fast . if i slow pump mimic my baby speed , suction excruciatingly painful -- it still doesn't pump slow enough . i am very unhappy this wish we'd just rented hospital-grade year instead . little cooler cute , but it tough actually fit frozen insert ( " blue " plastic thing ) four bottles there . it convenient horns pump directly into standard-size bottles ( it pump into dr. browns evenflo bottles too , any regular mouth size bottles ) or bags . i love setup , just wish pump slower speed settings speed suction truly adjustable independent each other . i can't pain like this all time am looking other options . :(	-1
initially , i thought these angled bottles make lot sense so i put different sizes into our registry . however , when our baby girl ( 1 week old ) first tried suck milk out bottle , it not come out . my husband activated vent everything according instructions . he thought holes not big enough since he not see any nipple , so he put more holes them but still nothing came out . he finally found out way these bottles work not same traditionally bottle . hole not open unless pressure applied against it hole get sealed back again when released . baby use their tongue push against nipples order open up hole . newborn infant , it too difficult them figure out how get milk out especially if you bottle feeding only . luckily we two avent bottles ( traditionally hole idea ) so she doing very well avent bottles she still loves them lot . we ended up returning unused ventair bottles got lots avent bottles but still stuck opened ones . i not recommend these ' difficult ' bottles newborn . baby should not need ' think ' how get milk out . leaking problem , we not any issue avent bottles . when it leaks , it usually because nipples not properly placed ( push all way though ring ) or ring not tightly screwed . we also found out if you use warmer warm bottle , you unscrew ring once screw it all tight again after warmer . it because theory heat expense plastic bottle which creates gap ring , nipples bottle neck . this works 99% us no leak . we fans avent bottles .	-1
i bought these my daughter thinking maybe they wouldn't leak like last ones i used . they don't leak , but stage 1 too slow frustrates her . she 5 months stage 2 too fast . they made huge mistake not making more stages . i realized this before i used them , i would taken them all back	-1

who ever designed this gate no clue what expect 1 year old child . this gate all look no function . it looks great when you install it but no strenght resist 13 month old child pushing it middle almost breaking it . if you plan buying this gate prepared little bit drilling bolting make it work . i finally able use thing only after i bought four #8 -32 1 3/4 " long screws matching washers nuts bolted middle gate together . i this unscrewing original connection middle gate overlapped pieces together 6 " then drilling two holes 4 " apart top bottom rails bolting together . it works ! but it not what someone should after spending thie price something . good luck !!	-1
i can't believe anyone would give this stroller good review . we 10m twins , using stroller 4-5 months . it terrible . problems : 1 . no sun protection . visors locked place . unless sun directly overhead or your back , it beating your babies ' eyes , you'll need buy non-peg perego sunshade accessory . 2 . hard steer . it gets stuck going across lawn compacted dirt . if sidewalk buckles just inch ( common tree roots ) , stroller stopped dead its tracks . it hard steer straight line , so it easy get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks . 3 . it flimsy . bottom storage area underneath stretched sagged after month use . it now drags ground rubs against wheels even when nothing it . cupholder broke during first week . 4 . hard unfold . it takes two hands unfold you give it vigorous shake get it completely unfold snap into position . don't even think trying set it up baby your hands : you need both hands free deal this thing . 5 . bad customer support . stroller comes no weight/height/age suggestions . when we first tried put our twins it , they swimming it , couldn't upright . when we called peg perego asked how big kids should use it safely , support rep said " don't know . " yes it lightweight folds up nicely . but light weight actually drawback ; it means handle legs flimsy wobbly -- resulting stroller that difficult steer . my advice would seriously consider jogging strollers . even if you aren't active parent -- i'm not -- get something sturdy big wheels get you over dips bumps cracks patches sand , dirt , grass you encounter . if stroller size most important factor you , look " stadium seating " strollers .	-1
i bought this stroller when we our second child . my children 19 mo . apart . i aria single stroller my first loved it . this one definitely not same . one thing , it very hard steer get over bumps . wheels always getting stuck . second , it hard close . most frustrating part steering issue . also , my aria decal fell off well many months ago . i've only stroller nine months . one more thing , canopy block out sun basically worthless since it offers very little protection sun .	-1
this diaper pail affordable uses regular garbage bags , both which important us when buying diaper pail before reality dirty diapers . even when we emptied pail often sprayed it lysol uses , it still smelled bad every time we opened it . sometimes smell seeped out , so it made whole bedroom stink . my kids no problem pressing blue lid-popping latch-and , course , adding their toys or other opjects contents dirty diaper pail . twisting mechanism remove full bag great idea . it helps you not get face full odor when you open pail ... but you cannot let pail get even close full , or it wont twist . after two years use , twisting mechanism doesn't work anymore . latch small opening also broken	-1
my husband i bought this hopes it would keep odor inside we could save money refills . well , it not control odor . plastic disk included neutralize odor works week . odor escaped even when pail closed . you save money refills first . but when diapers become stinkier baby grows , you change bag more often . i used lot baking soda lysol spray help control stink . also , button top opens pail fail easily , it also very easy child get into once they start pulling up things . i would not recommend this product	-1
it flimsy ... breaks slightest touch ... it pain open close ! my 15 month old figured out all you shake gate little it opens ... i found this out when i putting groceries away ... i went look her she 2nd stair top ! i can't say enough bad things this gate . it worthless . if i could rate it minus stars i would	-1

other reviewer stated , seal appears faulty this , it stopped working almost straight away . i seen many other bad reviews this product well	-1
this great idea , however if your crib anything larger than jenny lind style piece wood it , it won't work . we don't sleigh style crib , but top edges still too large velcro even touch . it would great if they would come up larger size work more popular/larger style cribs everyone seems making/buying these days	-1
these extensions should included co-sleeper . it , co-sleeper lower than average adult bed extensions required if you want your child sleeping your level . fact they sell it separate item pure gouging extra few bucks , which irritating . they simple pieces plastic shouldn't add but dollar or two arms reach cos t.t here twelve pieces , so you use max 3 pieces per leg increase it maximum height . we just , found three connected pieces * very * unstable . it too bad they charge so much poorly constructed set unstable plastic pieces . what they should provide set pieces varying heights , prevent too many connections bed that holding your precious child	-1
this product terrible . first foremost this seat not fit american airlines business class seats ! secondly , rear facing car seat tilts so far forward your baby falling forward agains harness if they fall asleep their face pressing against seat belt . wheel covers fell off first time i used it . stroller piece junk . when i called company explain my problems they never even called me back , so top it all they horrible product terribel customer service match . not buy	-1
i liked this tub first . size nice , sling comfortable good support my preemie newborn . after month use , though , there horrible odor emitting mesh sling . this after " squeezing " it out best i could propping it up dry after every use . sling not machine washable therefore unusable after it gets ruined mold . i stopped using sprayer after first couple days . it just too much pain fill it up everytime , especially since it doesn't even spray well . other reviewers correct saying button sprayer difficult press . especially when your hands wet slippery . it good thing bru take back anything ! i am off return it purchase old faithful cheapie tub	-1
i've never written negative review ... if i could give this zero stars i would . first all , it sinks instant you put it tub ... like all way bottom tub . tag says ring it out if it sinks ... hmmm ... how you when your kid it ? second all , it weighs 100 lbs when you take it out tub . i swear ... this worst baby product i've ever owned ( i've owned lot ) ... my 6mo son sits up great his own , slipping sliding around this , falling backwards , i hold him entire time both hands ... pathetic . don't waste your money . tomorrow we going out get traditional plastic bath seat ... good grief	-1
we researching booster seats our 2 year old we found this seat thought it large enough sturdy enough our rambunctious son . boy , we wrong . first time we put our son it seat fell apart . so we popped it back into place all he wiggle bit seat pops out again . he only weighs 30 pounds it specs up 50 .... i would definitely not recommend this anyone .	-1
we bought this booster when my son 18 months old he loved sit like his parents . however , he very large boy ( 35 " 34 lbs ) tray could not fit over his legs comfortably . so we took off tray so he could sit table , he uses holes where tray attaches stick food . we went back high chair without tray - he perfectly happy . we use this seat when visiting relatives which nice it so portable , but then spend time afterwards cleaning up food underneath seat where he stuck food	-1
i am so perplexed popularity this item ! when it first came out , i purchased one my son ( he around six months old time ) . he immediately figured out how get out seat leaning back , extending his arms behind him , straightening his legs , so i returned it . time i my second child ( girl ) , bumbomania kicked , these seats everywhere . i began think my son experience fluke , i purchased one my daughter . low behold , she immediately figured out how get out seat exact same way ! so i returned second bumbo well , but not before noticing instructions contain warning some children " may " able get out seat . conclusion , although bumbo may work great some - beware ! if you little houdinis like i , this product simply not safe	-1
i state this monitor very clear no interference but ours died after five months just nighttime use neither charger works ... we tried plugging monitors directly into wall , charging days time , even searched endlessly replacement batteries no luck . i ignored review i read similar one i'm writing just before i purchased this imonitor , i learned my lesson ! purchase caution .	-1

this nothing but cheap piece masonite board you cut $5.00 any hardware store . it cost me total $23.00 after shipping this product . it doesn't even look like picture . it isn't black angelcare written it . it literally normal , brown piece board . it blatant false advertizing . i feel sick , not mention total idiot thinking i would actually need this particular board go my monitor . if you angelcare movement sensor monitor don't flat bottomed crib then all you need any old piece wood or thick cardboard . not buy this . it disgrace	-1
first loved it because travel system , stroller , so light doesn't look doudy like other systems . but : harness buckle so difficult fasten baby gets irritated before we even get car . straps never tangled , but it extremely difficult adjust needed . carrying handle moved up/down two hands , button each , must simultaneously pushed lower handle . difficult perform when you're already reaching into center car even get baby . yes it trendy color gray , but it not cotton not padded well not breathe ! it horribly hot baby . still love stroller combi , but i never recommend car seat anyone . luckily , time move 5 month old larger seat anyway .	-1

perhaps if i hadn't already different type bunting , i wouldn't so disappointed this one . my sister loaned me her eddie bauer bunting when my son born . she her next baby any week now , so i return it her which meant i buy new one . i saw nothing but great reviews this product , so i picked one up . first all , i followed washing instructions , washing it separately delicate drying it low , it ripped one seam !! based alone , i returning it . aside , used bunting different design , i am not thrilled this one . part point using bunting so when you're car where you heat , you open up bunting longer drive so baby doesn't overheat . this bunting zips down both sides bottom ( way , zipping/unzipping tricky baby kicking around ; zipper gets stuck material lot ) , rather than down middle front ( style zipper never problem ) . then you this thick cover baby feet nowhere go it , bottom carseat up against back seat car ! so you either rig it so it up back seat tucked under headrest , or you leave it baby legs . also , top this bunting fold over so baby face isn't covered unless you want it , but ... my 5-month old no problem picking it up pulling it up over his own face . he it this morning way daycare . this bunting too thick me feel comfortable him doing . i can't reaching back seat pull it down off his face ! there no disputing concept bunting great , this particular bunting toasty warm . it wonderful able put baby his carseat strap him safely w/out snowsuit way , or bundle him up before going out unbundle him every time you get your destination . but i don't think design urban bundle-me great i actually think this bunting too warm ( even bunting open long car ride other day , my son back all sweaty when we took him out carseat ) . after calling several stores looking all my options babies ' ' us , i ended up ordering new eddie bauer all-season bunting target.com ( which cost less than $20 including shipping ) . i can't wait till it gets here . i returning $60 urban bundle-me soon i	-1

first , adhesive/velcro fasteners which attach this cover stroller inadequate say least . second , it opaque , so kids couldn't even take their surroundings . since it resembles parachute , only reason kids even got fresh air because * stupid * thing wouldn't stay attached stroller , kids probably wouldn't fresh air . go hats sunscreen/protective garments instead	-1
this nicely designed walker my baby likes it most part but we not exactly satisfied it one reason . front wheels turn all directions but rear wheels don't . just like car , it only go forward backward , but not sideways . sometimes my baby turns her upper body side tries reach something her left or right but she can't push walker way because design , she gets frustrated . if both front wheels rear wheels types turn any direction , it would much greater mobility	-1

this pump really slow , absolutely kills your hand . same price get avent isis manual pump , it waaaaaay faster because massaging petals you get way more milk per pump , so it doesn't hurt your hand . i haven't found it hurts my hand all , because you use it way less time pump far less often .	-1
i used one these my son ( he 3 , so it wasn't long ago ) but i getting ready use it again my daughter , i started thinking what pain floppy seat use . getting it back into it " bag " such hassle i used just plunk thing back into backseat car after shopping ... which made convienent small-space self storage waste time money . this thing named well , it really floppy- floppy put into cart floppy try put away again . i started reading reviews other seat covers , trying find better option i sure found it ! i really hesitant price buggy bagg , but i could tell when i took it out box it worth extra money ! i've only buggy bagg 3 days i am already thrilled i spent money it ... definitely worth extra $20 ! it super-well padded really , truly put into cart one hand !

i absolutely agree this review : " you not get your moneys worth ..., february 26 , 2006 " we bought this stroller per recommendation friend ours . we sable color , which i see not sold this year ... but i digress . we using this stroller eight months our eight month old absolutely fed up it . my biggest complaint steering . front wheels slide sideways over any smooth surface if we're not smooth surface , it feels like i am pushing stroller into brick wall because they don't rotate allow me push stroller forwards . i am always backing up turning order get front wheels align so i get where i want go . shopping joke this stroller because i cannot get it navigate aisles easily . shoulder straps attached back stroller little plastic tab which , really , doesn't seem like best way keep child shoulders restrained . it ends up coming out tab holder my son virtually only wearing lap belt . this fine now he able handle 3 point instead 5 point harness but when he younger , this got my nerves . adult cup holder joke , so we took it off my son figured out how take kid cupholder out so it doesn't stay any longer well . oh , thing folding down so handlebar catches sunshade complaint spot . so frustrating ! not big deal , really , but poor design because sunshade prevents handlebar locking folded up stroller folded up position most time . i just remembered also , sides padding seat area , when i used this stroller our graco snugride car seat , would bunch up prevent car seat sitting securely . i would prop edges padding seat area underneath arm-rests seat area ( parts say aria ) before i put car seat into stroller seat area so it would sit deep enough latch onto cup area allow security strap go over carseat snugly . if peg perego could fix steering , i think i would able live rest my complaints but steering factor enough me trash whole 9 pound thing now i found stroller steers so much easier my 22 pound 8 month old son	-1
i used these through out my daughter infancy , largely because i bought whole set them , milk storage contraptions , breast pump , pacifiers . plus once she used pacifiers nipples she wouldn't take any other kind . but bottles routinely leaked , ruining several diaper bags , clothing , nighttime feedings . apparently you screw cap just right- which really difficult 3 am ! my daughter didn't seem gas colic other reviews talk , but we use quite bit gas medicine 3 6 months . all all , i think paci great , rest it i could without .	-1

our 4 month old loved this toy , first . but we replace batteries so frequently end it didn't work more than it . runs through batteries much too quickly . also , unable start it remote control so we reach over carseat push button begin . but now it trash because i touched straps holding it up they disintegrated into blue dust . not very safe . very disappointed	-1
i saw this store , i just buy it . i loved all little pockets storing different things ; it would keep all my baby changing gear other necessities all one place . picture cover shows it stocked full hanging side dresser , which used changing table . what marvelous concept ! so , i took it out package , attached it dresser put all my gear onto it . it looked very smart hanging there , so practical ! when i came room next day , it floor crumpled lump . so , little disheartened , but not wanting give up , i hooked it up my crib , instead . it next best thing i really like device . i put all my gear there once more , wipes top shelf just like picture , but top shelf so flimsy wipes topple off it . so , not only i not hook it up my changing table , i also can't keep all changing gear it . this essentially makes this ill-made product completely worthless purpose it designed .	-1
we purchased this stroller its convenience car frequent travel . i think it safe say we ambivalent relationship volo , not including my 12 month old daughter who would give it definite thumbs down . up side it very light folds easily compact . not mention everyone gets see you maclaren stroller wonderful shade orange . stroller great airport quick shopping trips when you out car . we first purchased volo without springing seat pad . this mistake our daughter clearly uncomfortable unwilling spend significant time stroller . seat pad increase her comfort level but she still grows tired volo much more quickly than her larger stroller . i think this fact she not very upright volo cannot shift much seat it offers no support . top it , velcro seat pad becomes unhinged each time you fold stroller - minor annoyance but hassle all same . awning offers very little sun protection . mesh cargo area holds very little difficult access . top , you need empty it completely order fold stroller . when it comes travel volo leaves much desired . limited cargo room , it becomes quite unstable if you hang anything handles . it no recline making it difficult children sleep well - problem when you want spend day wandering . further , while it great such lightweight stroller when getting it out car , riding escalators getting off bus , volo flounders once you get off well-paved surfaces . we encountered potholes , dirt paths , cobblestones sand our tavels volo disaster . wheels would spin erratically catch large divets gutters . locking front wheels so they would not swivel provided little relief . cobblestones particularly disastrous stroller so hard manage such uncomfortable ride we ended up carrying both child volo . if i it over , i would opt compact stroller weighs bit more but offers larger wheels , easy-access storage supported reclining seat	-1

graco might making killing this product they charge over $100 something appears made less than $20 worth materials . seat much too big fit regular compact car such 2006 nissan sentra unless you decide install center seat location which advantage safer , but much more inconvenient . documentation , my opinion very poor , i've installed linux systems scratch w/ less documentation ... bad documentation could lead unnecessary infant injuries deaths if people don't completely understand instructions . let not talk styling ... wasn't black , red gray popular 80 or i miss come back somewhere ... i hope i find something better ... i'm giving this product two stars because it job ... but i expect much more product	-1
i very disappointed this mirror . i gave it 2 stars instead 1 because i use mirror . i 2000 vw passat headrest middle seat so i no problem installing it . it great watch my little one while i drive . i see other reviewer point it safety issue because you kind get obsessed watching your baby you should keep your eyes road . however , it never obstructed my view all . i registered this because remote control feature . well , remote control only turns unit off you keep switch unit " " ( remote control access mode ) order it work . there switch unit play music or turn lights play music . you cannot control feature remote control . you also cannot control volume remote . it really pain . i'm keeping it because i like mirror but i'm not happy it . save your money buy safefit baby sight mirror .	-1
it very difficult attach it anything . straps short under strange angel . my son not play it	-1
i purchased this toy my son when he 4 months old . first , he seemed little intimidated toys , would cry when i put him it . once he got used it , he really enjoyed it . now he plays all toys , he likes it wobbles around . his favorite toy seems sun counting beads . i not experience problem feet others wrote . just lucky i guess . seat really hard remove washing , which why i gave it 4 stars instead	1
i ( more importantly , my twin boys ) really like this jumper . it seems safer than doorway jumper , mainly because their fingers won't get mushed . i like it multiple height settings it sturdy frame . they love jump it , before they able crawl , it one few ways them get out some excess energy get some exercise . plus , it nice safe place times when i'd like get something without keep constant eye one babies . cons ( wouldn't keep me buying it again ) : it takes up more room than doorway jumper , rattly bear pretty loud , music obnoxious . there on-off switch two volume settings music , though	1

our son got these blocks when he 2 months old . my husband enjoyed them more first , but time our son 5 months old he loved playing these ! he probably couldn't hold them well until he 5 months old , so why he enjoyed them more this age than earlier . 10 months , he still enjoys playing them . they lasted through " both " children . i would highly recommend these blocks infants , so far even into toddler age , he enjoys playing them	1
these blocks contain everything you could want toy . each different textures , images , something unique it . -the yellow block duck one side " quacks " when pressed . other side sun whose face flips up reveal tiny mirror . side picture some bananas clear plastic over them make interesting texture yet side contains circle motif . -the red block rattles , picture robin (?) one side , square pattern motif side , picture strawberries . -the green block frog 3d legs one leg pull toy cause block shake . it also picture green apple ( mine , least , although this picture shows leaf ) , silky fabric leaf prints , triangle motif . -the blue block rattle . it picture turtle one side , some jeans made real denim , star motif . -all blocks side color name ( i bought mine target , they name english , spanish , french although these pictured only show it english ) . rest sides filled textured fabrics such soft , fluffly fur or bumpy texture ( like material found bottom some slippers prevent skidding ) . my three month old loves look these blocks i rub different sides against her skin while saying " soft " , " smooth " , or " bumpy " she loves feelings . my friend daughter , who five months , loves pick up throw down blocks . it one her favorite games . i'd reccomend these blocks must any infant	1

we bought two different kinds gates our living room area . we bought kidco configure gate kidco elongate . elongate cover area 84 " . elongate only go straight across opening . it extension screwed together overlap . so gate not actually straight across . we very disappointed this purchase wished we bought two configure gates . took us some time screw extension then screw supports then mark it wall . took us over hour . configure gate pricey side . we almost not buy it . but it two different size extension pieces you bend configure it space you need . we use it bottom our stairs it bows out give you area so gate not up against stairs . it so easy add extension piece . you just snap out pole add extension piece . you bend gate different ways fit opening . mount wall you just mark screw holes screw plate then snap gate . it mounted wall less then 20 minutes . it very sturdy . i highly recommend this gate .	1

i actually bought this netting use cover our baby cradle ( we two cats didn't want them nap it while baby wasn't it ) . i've used it once my pak ' play while outside but found it especially useful when my daughter fell asleep her jogging stroller after walk our neighborhood . since it such nice day i let her nap stroller(it fully reclines ) netting covering entire stroller . i feel , such low price , this netting worth it whatever reason you chose use it	1

not sure what all fuss regarding assembly . i just unpacked assembled it few minutes ago no trouble . assemble probably too strong word , there no actual assembly or tools involved . weight , maybe 15 pounds , certainly nowhere near 50 . instructions seemed sufficient although i didn't really need use them . basically , if fear difficult assembly reported here your only concern , don't let stand way choosing this item .	1
i bought this product because it two most important things i am looking : portable splash guard . my son feels very comfortable it he using this since last august when we got it . parts all plastic easy cleaning . cushion part seat splash guard all one piece , unlike some other potty seat where splash guard attachment . so that very easy clean . entire potty disembled cleaned sanitized inside out , no hard reach spots . seat soft contoured oval opening which best , unlike lot potty i found circular small opening . seat put adult toilet seat which i started training my son after several use avoid cleaning bowl . only thing i wish this product comes just seat without bowl , then would even better !	1

this seems like really sturdy , lightweight stroller . i just wanted something simple strong get us out house quickly -- we live very hilly , sort rustic area , so i needed something i could take my son park without hauling out big buggy . this really light , it folds carrying strap case boy wants walk bit . ( there also storage bag travel . ) tires treads them , so they handle steep terrain , they give pretty smooth ride over bumps . fabric sort thick canvas-sy polyester -- not removable , but it seems like it could easily scrubbed/hosed clean if necessary . seat also some padding back support ( although , con side , it probably not coolest compared mesh ) . weight limit given 37 lbs , so my 19-month old still plenty room grow -- his shoulders comfortable his feet don't reach footrest yet ( he 27 pounds 33 inches tall ) . plus side , it seems bigger than wrangler all-weather umbrella stroller , plus it reclines bit ( you unzip/unbutton sides allow fabric unfold ) , unlike volo . square canopy maybe not greatest ( it only covers face , could actually sit little higher i think) -- but everyone complaining it falls off , i found when you flip canopy back , if you then detach back flap seat , you attach side flaps velcro back keep it sliding off . some people also mentioned kicking wheels , but i'm 5'6 " haven't any problems -- i think it matter not standing right top thing since it umbrella stroller doesn't superwide wheelbase . i would give it 4.5 stars i think , but am giving 5 because great price ! i'm pretty happy this -- my son constantly trying climb , so he must like it too ... i figure money we saved , we buy nice kettrike or some other form transportation boy grow into .	1
we bought this tub because our son struggled bath seats . he too big infant bath tubs but certainly couldn't handle full size version . this tub perfect option . only thing could make this product better slip resistant bottom tub	1

finally ! big , spacious , nice looking toy box !! i looked long time toy box could set out our family room still blend rest decor , but bigger than little wooden toy boxes out there ! lid finally improved old ones where lid never stayed up . drawers bottom small , but hold few things , don't take anything away big interior box . it makes box look more sofisticated !! love new colors design . thanks little tikes !	1
used infantino front carrier several hours day until my back started hurt . purchased ultimate baby wrap based reviews here . i liked idea even weight distribution able put baby different positions . while using wrap isn't intuitive ( ie watch dvd ) it easy learn . my back problems gone baby more snug wrap ( tummy tummy ) than traditional front carriers . i wanted use sling position but baby too big length width wise . only gripe there no neck support tummy tummy position so i hold baby head while i rock her sleep . would recommend this product , great price too	1
this great young babies .. once my son became more active ( which when it safe use regular crib bumper anyway ) he would put his legs it it would scrunch down since it very thin - unlike big padded more sturdy bumpers come w/ crib set . i think only flaw but i definitely use it again my next infant/baby	1
this protects our leather seats well but much wider than infant carrier base which crowds other passengers sitting next baby . otherwise good product .	1
i like this because it nice construction . i bought white it blends nicely . i just wish it little higher . we newer construction home bathroom counters high so it still too low her wash hands herself now .	1
i really like how this step designed stay place . we cheaper plastic stool bathroom tends scoot too easily our son climbs up it . this one stays put ! only reason this stool didn't get 5 stars me because textured top . it little difficult clean . since this potty step stool , it gotten some messes it i wish would easier get rid	1
after using smaller plastic tub blow up tub , this one best ! i only wish i would've just bought this one begin . my little guy 6 months old , 24 pounds but can't sit up yet . he still uses side lays him down water , he loves it ! don't waste your money other tubs , this one best . this one grow your child while saving water too	1
i bought this carrier recent trip my family took i am so glad i it ! i used it my 8 month old carry her around instead using stroller . there many pockets which plenty room store all your needed items stand works well set down ground when not wearing it . my daughter seemed quite comfortable it one point even fell asleep . she loved able see everything around her our level . i am 5'3 " my husband 6'1 " we both wore it comfortably . i would recommend this item anyone needing something smaller than stroller	1
my baby now 5 months old , we've using halo sleep sac since she started moving around more . i always worried regular blanket because more than few times she would wake up crying because she kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now , i never worry she soffocate or she cold middle night . this product really gives me peace mind i'll sure give this any new parent friends	1
it expensive but worth it . it nice take work because it looks professional ( many people didn't even know what it ) it comes cooler so i didn't put my milk fridge next everyone lunch . friend also bought one around same time says she got it much cheaper ebay brand new one .	1
this so much better than any potty chair , it never way ! very easy put my daughter loves it ! she ahs potty trained year but my nephew who just now potty training loves it also !!	1
this fit very easily into my daughter graco infant car seat . other reviewers said , it very convenient keeps my daughter nice warm . wind not seemed problem , but then i only carry her car my destination it . i would recommend this friend	1
i wouldn't call this " rocker seat " kick-stand it makes it look like rocker , if you put stand down .. legs almost touch floor . you make it move little if you wood floors , but not enough call it rocker . if you very mellow baby , this chair perfect . my baby likes sit stare toys . but if you need any type movement your baby stay calm , i wouldn't recommend this chair . music/sounds it very nice , not annoying all . i don't use vibration it yet , until my baby itch his cheeks if needed . only reason i say 4 stars not 5 because it falsely advertised " rocker " , other than , it very cute , my baby enjoys it alot !	1
i don't generally write reviews but wanted praise baby trend design this car seat . we directed it after january 07 consumer reports review showing this one only two infant car seats pass their more stringent crash tests ( tv news showed alarming video various car seats flying around passenger compartment after struck vehicle ) . compared our still-new safety 1st seat , this one so much better engineered number ways : 1 ) base super easy install . click twice into each car two anchor points , then tug each two straps tighten base . that it . our old seat paragraphs confusing directions didn't leave me confident this one . 2 ) base easily adjustable tilting mechanism leveling indicator insure you get right angle baby head ( no flopping ) . our old seat no such system - we used rolled-up towels . 3 ) seat dial quickly adjust seat height baby grows . no such system our old seat . 4 ) handle ergonomic triangle shape top more secure grasp when reaching into car left or right . 5 ) if base not available , seat strapped directly into car using car lap belt . 6 ) seat overall more narrow than our old seat , allowing our two other kids fit back seat little more breathing room . every inch helps . 7 ) seat lighter than our old seat , although it feels just secure solid old one . all this , seat same price our old one . unfortunately amazon/target sold out when consumer reports issue came out , but i found them stock online wally world , if you looking get one quickly . one sale here better color combo than wally , unless you like lime green - but seats themselves all same superb design . summary : super easy install adjust , well thought-out features , fair price ! makes me want more kids just buy more these :	1
i tried several different bottles my daughter these worked wonderfully us . we actually came across them when walmart stopped carrying parent choice anti colic bottles we using which similar design . these bottles really seem decrease amount air my daughter takes while she feeding . this blessing she problems gas since birth . she also reflux . i can't tell you if bottles major factor her improvement area because she now meds . however , i think they've helped bit . they also comfy hold me . i've read lot reviews talk leaking . i this problem once because i heated bottle valve system it . so , i learned not so not problem since . they bit pricy , but i believe you get what you pay . lastly , i don't think small parts difficult wash . yes , it bit more time consuming if you don't dish washer , but us , it well worth extra time	1
i purchased this despite reviews i read , out desperation ! but very happy fit my eddie bauer morgan gingham playard bassinet . it little thin , however , i use carter mattress pad underneath anyway , so i am not concerned absorbancy . it job nice surface lay my son head , i purchased one more navy switch out when it laundry time	1

i bought this set gift , but also received it gift myself ( my registry ) . although my daughter two half now , i would recommend playtex nursers everyone ! they sanitary cause less gas than conventional bottles . i definitely like drop-ins liners better than traditional ones ... convenience standpoint , paired fact they work so well breast milk storage system . i'm not planning any more children , but i don't dare part these bottles yet . they stored my basement future use , either my myself or family members . they also helped make transition breast bottle sippy cup breeze	1

due room layout , i needed double bed rail would protect both sides bed . we don't live near store lot choices after reading many online product descriptions decided we going need look several these " person " then decide which one best fit our needs . so we purchased 4 brands bed rails . after looking more detailed information box trying two them out , we decided keep safe secure double bedrail first years . help others , i attached two customer photos this product description . these photos sketches photos side box better describe bed rail . why amazon/target can't get least much information their website than side box frustrating me . but seems happen many times . this bedrail took 30 minutes assemble side panels 45 minutes fully assemble unit bed . this line time other model we tried out took . reasons why we liked this bed rail best follows :( 1 ) it double bed rail designed protect both sides bed . ( 2 ) this only model we looked where both sides folded down making mattress pad sheet changes feasible . ( 3 ) quality construction ( especially spring loaded locking pins ) much better than sleeptite bed rail we looked regalo one step ahead ( which also made regalo . )( 4 ) design made more sense than regalo . installation more straightforward . possible issues this bed rail follows :( 1 ) it only 17 " high , so measure your mattress make sure it fit . our case , our mattress not pillowtop 10-11 " high , depending where you measure it . so we still satisfied height rail above our mattress . but i could see where if you tall mattress this would issue . ( 2 ) this easiest rail pull up unlock fold down . others more substantial locking mechanisms . i could see where toddler who watched you this , could then it himself . so we planning not doing this front our toddler , only during sheet changes . only you know how inquisitive your own child these things how much problem this would . despite these two issues , we decided good points outweighed bad this bedrail best choice us . however , if we later disappointed this bed rail , i go update our review .	1
i own this blanket just bought ! i brought this blanket my playgroup park . it perfect damp grass big enough me , my daughter , all our stuff . few other moms liked it so much they bought it too . my baby spits up quite bit , especially during tummy time , so i decided buy one use house . it cleans so easily baby wipe or damp cloth . great investment	1

i love this product . i 5 month old twins born 6 weeks early . i swaddled them receiving blankets when they came home nicu they loved sleeping way . i stopped swaddling them 2 months because i could see they no longer liked it . my night nurse told me continue swaddle them night up year . she said it would help them sleep through night . i bought this product while my girl boy twins didn't like it first they go sleep faster stay asleep longer when they wearing them . not long after i started using this product my son slept 7 7 . what dream ! he getting better getting least one arm out but even when he he still sleeps better then when he not swaddled all . i found it works better when i put them it when they drowsy because then they don't lay their crib trying get out it before they fall asleep . we don't use them during day now . i always give this baby gift going forward	1
i love this item . it life saver . around 4-6 weeks , my baby would only sleep if held or laying his side next me after breastfeeding . since it impossible hold baby all night laying next me his side " no , no " sids , i looking something could help me get him sleep his bassinet his back suggested prevent sids . i tried swaddling my baby blankets , but after few weeks he figured out how get out it . i also didn't like he could undo blanket it loose around his face , " no , no " sids . so i bought these swaddle me blankets fasten easily velcro . shortly after we started using swaddle me , he started sleeping through night , occasionally waking up 15 minute feeding ( which i keep him swaddled ) then he falls right back sleep i carefully pick him up put him back bassinett rest night . he 4 months old now we're still using them .... buy few , because if we wets himself , which boys lot , you'll need one switch him into	1

i say up front i use gate bottom stairs not top product suggests . gate built well ... simple functional . it optional ability restrict direction movment hinges give great angle movment detach easily . it went up easy works designed . it just tiny bit awkward reach latch release pull back gate but this very minor issue . similar vien , you line up bottom rail same time you line up top rail order close . my guess it would less awkward if used top stairs recommended . overall i would recommend gate both locations stairs	1
we bought this swing our 11 month old daughter , she loves it ! we attached it our back porch easily enough , she swings it every day ! we've it month it still her favorite toy ! only issue we it hangs slightly crooked because way they put hooks swing factory . aren't both facing same direction , which something we cant fix , but it isn't bad enough not use swing or cause any problems . its more irritating than anything . also , swing seems secure safe . we've not any issues safety , or even any close calls	1
we gone through few packages table toppers we love them ! our toddler went trying peel them off table helping us stick them down .... she loves pull paper strips off adhesive .... she doesn't try pull mat off table until she finished eating . we finally found shopper toppers toys us i so excited i bought two packages .... they don't work worth anything ! adhesive those down sides , not across top where it should , stick shopping cart handle .... fact we've decided table toppers work better shopping cart than ones made shopping cart . also , only shopper topper our bag while out lunch recently , we used it table it worked just well ones made table ! well	1

i love these little books ... they play music .. good before bed , my girls chew them ( which makes both me my two year old son happy ) ... just fantastic ... great buy	1
my sister who 4 kids insisted i buy this boy she right ! those you who say it takes time snap it off aren't thinking what you change crib sheet . first all , bumper removed just get mattress any reasonable fashion that pain tie off . especially when you get it there just right . then you lift up mattress get sheet bottom pull it over corners . i mention moving mattress causes cute little dust ruffle get out poistion ? ugh , i don't think so . i'd much rather deal few straps snaps then my daughter sit soaking sheet ( this pad wicks away moisutre ) go through so much trouble change it . far " imprint " her face , i haven't noticed any she hasn't bothered	1
but , there 2 things i don't like . one toys hanging bar too low . my sons knees hit it he only 6 weeks old . second continuous play songs , don't actually continually play . it actually pauses 1-2 minutes . my son fall asleep music , then it pauses starts up again , waking him . i love vibration feature , which main reason i bought it . all all , it worth it	1
i worried this looked cheap , too sterile hospital-like my new baby , but it much more attractive person . safetly 1st needs new photo taken this crib , theirs looks dated . it arrived took less than five minutes assemble , myself 8 months pregnant ! completely assembled except sliding four leg castors into place lifting bars open position . click- ! two adjustable height settings , comes nice mattress . i would not order one . this very soft suitable . this rolls easily pack play bedding fits it perfectly . eddie bauer sheets target come fleece fabric extremely soft , love it ! my crib skirt large crib fits adjustments i love way it turned out . fact i can't believe this one cheapest alternatives , since i would say it nicer than wooden mini-cribs i saw person local store . i 24 month old i not want two cribs , but i also not want rush her into toddler bed . we bought one , but she doesn't want stay it night . she feels safe sleeps well her crib . this crib stable fine our second child until older baby out her crib . this great product very reasonable too !	1
[ ... ] it def . ... very sturdy , doesn't move around once you strap it chair it looks good too :) i'm very happy this chair - contoured seat back really hugs baby yet doesnt constrict his arms ... i love size tray size cupholders . i find it very easy hand wash bottom only needs good rinse ... my son hasn't gotten food under there yet ... i can't wait use it booster seat :	1

i love this pillow . i've it two half months now . first it helped me stay my side , just comfy snuggle up . now my belly getting bigger , it gives great support doesn't let my belly " hang " down . this great people who don't always sleep their sides once you position it you unlikely roll over your sleep . i've no problem stuffing . if you looking super firm support , try wedge . this pillow , feels such . course , if you budget , you always just use regular pillow , but if you want pamper yourself unique shape this pillow makes it extra comfortable . ** update ** i'm now 8 months pregnant love my pillow ! mine came covered zippered cover , so what i wash . every few nights , i just grab larger part shake it hard until stuffing falls down , then fluff it it good new . i also like , yes , it take up some room , but no where near much room many pregnancy pillows . all all , whether you like this pillow or not come down personal choice	1
this great potty boys . we some problems accidents some other brands but this one keeps what should happen potty , potty . easy clean , too	1
i twin boys 3 i love this chair . it doesn't lid or removable splash gurad . i two other sets chairs twins only play . putting lids up down , taking out removable seat catch basin , etc . this simply constructed unit no corners or edges . it smooth contours including splash guard not come off attached catch basin . catch basin combination seat/emptying pail which enables you easily remove empty . it easily cleaned because simple design less appealing play . i think best feature smooth built splash guard which you need boys . this seat not convert toilet seat bathroom toilet , which i think doesn't work anyway - other potty chairs i purchased seats slide flop when you put it real toilet then becomes unsafe . i recommend babybjorn toilet trainer	1
i love this product . all new mothers should include this their registry , how we've lived without it this long , i'll never know ! it wonderful safety product overlooked until now	1
this works great our chicco capri stroller . it took bit trial error get it perfect place so stroller would close . however , once i figured out , it great . i could take accessories off just put them when needed . swivel great concept . i actually wish it came third clasp so baby could cup holder snack holder ( one each side ) mommy could her water bottle clip . we just switch them out baby or they hold their sippy handles .	1
i used this product all three my children it great . easy use quick sterilise . regard previous comments not sterlising equipment , i should point out there difference clean sterile . all babies vulnerable germs cause diarrhoea vomiting , so it best continue sterilising bottles teats ( breast pump equipment ) until your baby one year old built up more resistance bacteria generally . cleaning your baby bottles teats dishwasher not always heat them right temperature kill off all known bugs , so it generally still advisable sterilise after washing . if you want rely your dishwasher alone , it needs run hot programme minimum temperature 80 degrees centigrade . bottles then need filled feed straight away dishwasher not leave them completely sterile condition . it may seem pointless sterilise feeding equipment when your baby crawling around floor putting all sorts things his mouth , but bugs stick milk curds dangerous . your baby immune system grow stronger into second year he'll able combat infections more easily . it might seem inconvenient some , but sterilising reduces your baby chances ingesting harmful bacteria it baby health , not what mother feels she doesnt time .	1
whoever designed this toy really understands mind toddler . my grandaughter took this instantly it became her favorite activity . yes , activity . time when so many toys designed keep child one place this one gets them up moving ; no moving , no peek-a-boos ! it contributed significantly her becoming steady her feet building healthier baby . good value any price	1
this sensor all peace mind . we've using it few weeks now it gone off twice - scaring us , but making us glad we it . both times its gone off , our daughter very tightly swaddled , so we think made her breathing shallow thus set off alarm . you change sensitivity it , but default setting should fine . there bit background noise or static you hear . my husband solved issue placing piece regular household tape bottom few speaker holes . it still loud enough us hear her without extra noise . it take some getting used - you turn off sensor put it sound only mode whenever you remove baby crib , otherwise sensor go off . but this `inconvenience ' totally worth peace mind this sensor gives you . i believe they sell this only one parent unit - but you really want get two . leave one bedroom keep other mobile - we constantly move second kitchen bonus room , living room , etc . this sensor amazing product worth every penny .	1
there two types dekor refill , one regular one ' plus ' . sizes different you better sure order right one .	1

our daughter started fighting diapers when she only 6-7 months old , so fit desperation , i bought this potty , put her it never looked back . it helped potty really comfortable , wide , flat bottom left no marks her tush , stable enough so there no accidents . i only give it 4 stars because i really could not snap seat toilet because whole construction so darn plasticky . ah , music never worked ( no loss my opinion , i there encouraging ) training book seemed bit cheesy . toddler may also entertain thoughts removing easily accessible container while sitting , which may lead whole new set problems . but overall , this potty made our lives so easy during potty training , i cannot but lavish praise over this little piece plastic	1

this product great first few weeks after we brought baby home . while others said velcro very loud late night diaper changes , i found i could keep it velcro'd top just slip her legs out through bottom . my daughter really liked this , but quickly outgrew it . just one month old she didn't want her arms tied down , so usefullness product limited . baby who loves swaddled , this indispensible item . i'll pass mine our hand-me-downs . you never tell which baby want swaddled	1
first , i must say this sling absolute lifesaver when my ( somewhat colicky ) son newborn . no matter how fretful his mewling , when we swaddled him placed him this sling , he would fall asleep . because he otherwise rarely slept those early weeks , he spent good deal time it . three aspects design great : 1 . bottom padded so you lay baby hard surface use sling changing pad ; 2 . sides high drawstrings allow sling opened up almost flat ; 3 . it grows your baby -- my tiny baby hated fron t-t ype bjorn carriers , but loved this still likes it . one aspect design , me , dreadful -- shoulder strap ! it should wider padded . i tried repositioning it every which way no matter what i , strap dug into my shoulder . end i just put thick mitten under strap my shoulder . good use mitten that lost it mate , but i would rather better strap	1

i think everyone should one these , especially when their kids young . my 8mo . old tries eat everything . i don't want him chewing handlebars grocery cars ( yuck ! ) it makes it much cleaner when you put him highchair restaurants ( which sometimes disgusting ) . best part it fits over extra large shopping carts club stores , like [ ... ] , unlike other types	1
we bought our floppy seat when our baby boy 6 months old . even though he still little " floppy " himself when it came sitting up , floppy seat supported him . he now 18 months old , it still going strong ! although , now he wears " real " shoes , leg openings tend get caught then . it took little practice get hang threading belt through cart , but now it so fast ! we also use it every time we go out eat . matter fact , one ( only ) time we forgot bring it , our son started choke while sitting restaurant highchair . belt buckle old restaurant chair became stuck , would not open , after multiple attempts ! we forced turn whole chair sideways order proceed clear his airway . he fine , but we all shaken up ! if we'd our ( familiar ) floppy seat cover , we would able help our son few moments faster . every second counts !	1

true -- other reviewers stated , this not gate swing open unless you use hardware , which i not , so i cannot comment how well works . tension or pressure-mounted gate , i love this item . i no problems stepping over it -- i'm only 5 ' 5 " -- so i never found it nuisance . it easy use one hand snaps into place easily . it also easy adjust size fit different sized door openings , although takes two hands . it light enough i carry my 13-month old son one arm gate other i travel floor floor . my 2 year old learning sleep room herself so we use gate doorway so she call us her room without free wander into hallway or onto stairs . again , we love fact we don't damage molding doorframes . my husband i so satisfied this item we plan buying one	1
this chair larger than some seats out there , fits my average-sized 2 1/2 year old boy very well . some seem like they would really hard boy use , things tend spray out smaller seats ! seat shaped just right splashes , it seems comfortable . now if only my little guy would use it more than once day , we'd business ! i love simple design , my son loves color ( he picked it out himself ) , it so simple clean . it also grips bottom so it won't slide bathroom floor when he sits it -- must	1
i am totally fan cloth diapering now i've actually it . i must admit i very apprehensive before i actually used them because i thought it would so much work , but it really amounts doing load laundry every other day ... not hard . these diaper covers fantastic . i not single leak them . when my daughter first born , friend gave us several packs newborn disposable diapers we used first few weeks , we numerous leaks . we actually used newborn size super whisper wrap first two months small size now . she 6 pounds 11 ounces when she born . i use chinese prefold diapers them . i tried two different types gerber prefold , but they're just not absorbant quickly saturated . what sold me these covers how i wash them diapers when they soiled i don't hand wash them or anything	1

this chair very sturdy we keep it attached our table my son only high chair . i love how little space it takes up compared conventional high chair . however , i bought this chair because 9 months my son would climb out anything . i thought chair nothing under his feet might give him less leverage . even shoulder straps tight they go , he wiggle out it stand up chair . if you looking downsize your baby accessories you don't climber - this chair you , but if you escape artist - this chair no better than typical high chairs	1
i discovered this product recently when i my second baby . i received it baby shower gift i love it . it so much easier than swaddling blanket . i now bought large one my son ( 3mos ) yet figure out how get out it . other thing i like it you wrap wings around baby waist or upper chest , leave his arms out , use it during day like blanket . voila , blanket won't fall off when you're holding him , or kicked off when he lying down . kiddopotamus really come up some great products . you might also want check out piddle pad . great invention/product kiddopotamus	1

i bought this product after reading many positive reviews below , i thoroughly satisfied . my only complaint actually my luggage , handle my bag little short so i stoop little while i pushing/pulling it . everyone who saw it thought it neatest invention ever , especially other moms traveling kids . strap so simple it genious - just strap carseat go ! it bit hassle restrapping security , but everything hassle security . just make sure you few extra minutes get everything back together it fine . this great product made what could very difficult trip breeze . bravo !	1
sizes perfect , especially small one my 5 month old . suction works fine so far , but we see baby gets older	1
finally found this item ! i couldn't find this anywhere locally . it easy kids use it easy clean	1
pupsqueak wonderful . i am picky mother toys . i hate toys too loud , too commercial , too cheesy , too useless ... i high standards . but pupsqueak gets my " picky mom seal approval " wholeheartedly . here why . i am very blessed mother who loves send my children lots goodies . while it easy know what send 4-year-old distinct likes interests , it harder gauge what twelve-week-old baby enjoy . we no shortage toys gadgets entertain our new daughter , she clearly enjoys some them , kicking legs , cooing , , waving arms , etc . pupsqueak , however , took it different level . she loves this thing . we showed it her around 11-12 weeks old , she immediately reacted . she laughed , she kicked , all signs . then , she reached little black white patterned bone hangs down . we so excited , she it attached bar her carseat ever since . real test , however , our 10-hour drive louisiana kentucky thanksgiving holidays . but pupsqueak came through us flying colors : anytime she would get fussy , i could reach back shake him bit so he would jingle softly , she would happy again . after my arm would get tired , i'd make sure he adjusted where she could get him , she would , not yet 4 months , bat it herself . pupsqueak wonderful toy soft , gently jingle young babies funny bark even makes my four-year-old laugh older babies . he definitely top dog my book	1
this great carseat carrier . easy install level indicator . few drawbacks : once my daughter few months old , it got really heavy carry around . she also outgrew it 6 months . harness needs longer . it doesn't release enough get taller babies out comfortably . some reason , release levers move handle get baby out really stiff difficult use . my mother law arthritis ended up either carry carseat both arms like bundle wood ( because she couldn't move handle up ) or try slide my daughter out top or bottom ( because she couldn't move handle back ) . my advice , before you buy , realisticly test everything it store compare it directly brand	1
this seat wonderful . my daughter can't quite sit her own yet , but this keeps her secure comfortable . make sure you loop belt around your child cart or high chair . this seat small very easy use ; it great product	1
i've using this pump ten months now it main reason i'm still nursing my little girl . i went back work when she four months old started pumping three times per day . first it hard try productive 20 minutes per session i pumping because you really hold breast shield breast , suction isn't enough . then i got easy expression hands-free bustier which solved problem . i now e-mail , talk conference calls , etc . while i'm pumping so i don't waste time work continue give my baby benefits human milk . i'm able fit four standard bottles two smaller/slimmer medela bottles into small cooler , ice pack so i don't think cooler too small . also , i don't think cooler meant transported backpack . if you don't try cram cooler backpack there no problem storage backpack . i also reccomend medela micro-steam bags working moms who choose pump once they go back work . also , i don't think suction too hard ... yes it may uncomfortable first minute or two until pressure engorgement reduced , but it no means painful . pain what i experience when my daughter bites her new razor-sharp teeth !	1
i am so greatfull this pump ! i able exclusively breastfeed two children year each , while working full time , taking vacations ( without kids ) , etc . i also car adapter which awesome , i able pump my work , ( which over hour away ) , while driving . i only recommend breatfeeding/pumping pros ! warranty only good year , but mine now three years old still going strong . we expecting our third child i hope my pump holds up year , if not i still probably spend money pump like this one ! best luck	1
my son wearing halo sleep sack since day he came home hospital . winter baby it best thing world know he would warm not worry loose blankets . he began sleeping through night 7 weeks old . i think sleep sack gives him feeling security . he never able sleep without it . he now 30 months old still won't go sleep unless he his sleep sack . we friend ours who seamstress add additional material bottom because he became tall it . how much he loves his sleep sack . it far best thing i ever bought my son	1
my son very picky eater but loves elmo . this set adorable practical . he loves spoon getting his food off plate bowl . th eonly thing ware -- it gets very hot microwave . even if you just put it 20 seconds , it must cool dow	1
we struggled 2 different monitors before we got imonitor graco . first 2 we tried so much static interference they useless . i can't explain how delighted my wife i hook up this monitor hear nothing but sounds our baby . it better than christmas morning when we kids !!! we wireless internet , cell phones , cordless phones , basically if its electronic we got it . despite all potential interfence graco delivers chrystal clear sound absolutely no interference . must buy any parent	1
when i my daughter i no clue where begin breast pads so i bought several different types . friend gave me these my baby shower because they here favorite . i wish i never wasted money other pads . i change these pads more often than some other brands . it worth it because they so much more comfortable . i didn't any chaffing like most others . also they stayed place ten times better than any pads adhesive .	1
bought 2 different monitors ; this one great features such motion sensor , auto scan settings . night vision weak but daytime looks great . better reception than other video monitor i bought but not good night vision drawback . i really bought video monitors keeping eye my mother who alzheimers but using 2 cameras comes handy both baby mom . none these seem quiet just regular baby monitor without video but it very comforting see not just hear . it best one i've found market	1
my husband purchased this bag me when i recently took trip solo my daughter . it seemed more troublesome than helpful . i ended up using backpack strap pull bag because i could not pull using regular strap comfortable positition . 1st flight bag ripped seam bottom scraping floor . when i arrived my destination i restitched bag thought maybe i careless my handling . return flight we more walking since airport little bigger , though it still small airport . when i arrived my destination bag completely separated bottom stitch my car seat base scratched mared result . damage bag so bad i never use it again . this bag should labeled disposable . though this good concept there needs better planning overall design quality . i would not recommend this product think twice before purchasing any other products this manufacturer	1
we like this stroller . it seems pretty durable , its weight portability ( shoulder strap ) make it ideal trips , especially airports . my husband hard time pushing it sometimes because he so tall ( 6'4 " ) , but it fine me ( 5'3 " ) . we like it our 5-month-old son because he able recline , but still sit up enough watch what going . he hold his head up well but isn't sitting up unsupported yet , so various levels reclining back nice . overall , good stroller price	1
put together well nice assortment items bag , nice gift all itself expectant mo	1
car seat itself awesome , but condition it arrived awful . box smashed caved it exposed rain or moisture some kind . there nothing covering seat ( like plastic bag ) so debris gotten into box soiled material seat . it gift my grandson christmas so i didn't time return it hope timely return . it took alot time effort clean spots off seat . simply packing seat plastic bag over it would made alot more sense me .	1
i am sure this good stroller ( that why i bought it ! )my " review " more word caution : this thing takes forever arrive . don't fooled : " usually ships within 24 hours " really means " may ship sometime " . 2/8/06 , our stroller not arrived . it ordered january 1 , 2006 . it not even slated ship week ( we'll see ... ) . meanwhile , local store several stock . my advice anyone trying time this gift or trip or other occasion : go your local store . otherwise , prepared wait very long time .	1
if you ipod or mp3 player , i'd recommend getting this . i think baby going love it ! i bought it last week , tested it out ( our baby hasn't born yet ) . speakers plenty loud enough baby crib or room imo , i'm 1/2 deaf . i also like little nightlight it changes color . my only criticism it takes batteries ( no ac adapter ) . we may invest rechargeable set batteries if it uses batteries up quickly . $20 , i think it great	1
just love it ! i jeep tandem it nice until my son got so big ( 40 lbs , 39 inches ) you couldn't steer it very well . bob amazing ! i 3 yr 1 yr old . you can't feel weight difference . it rides so nicely . both my children very tall/heavy ( dense ) their age my eldest plenty room grow - which my biggest concern . my husband just loves shocks - go figure . it compacts nicely .... if you need it even more compact wheels come off snap stored seat . it amazing ! i'm so glad i purchased it . rei great price it ($400+/- ... tried ebay too but rei best . fun your stroller search good luck	1
when it comes using this your children you'd first know what your needs . i can't imagine it stopping any determined child without some reinforcing ; it would more like psychological barrier . but depending their temperament age it may good deter them getting things they shouldn't . i ordered this use my puppy . my case i don't problem her pushing it so i can't say how long it would last through . this price i quite happy quality it amazingly simply install .	1
this wonderful stroller . i large 35lb , 2yr old he very comfortable . great folding mechanism . folding easy i it one hand . nice pockets storage	1

this bin great cloth diapers . we love ours . keeps odors minimum holds day or two worth diapers -- which all i need because we wash every other day . our local babies us sells replacement deodisks ( or you buy them online cloth diaper vendors ) when one comes it loses it smell so you maintain freshness . it easy clean use pretty inexpensive	1
original nursers enabled me return work after long maternity leave . my baby wouldn't take bottle until i introduced brown rubber nipple . thanks mom	1
i bought this seat couple weeks ago my 2 month old nephew using it when i him until my son born june . i love look , style safety this seat . only thing i thought may problem way shoulder straps adjust height . my nephew 22 " he almost second last adjustment . also side impacts don't leave alot room head positioner newborns they far enough apart head room wobble side side . my nephew seems love it though seems really comfortable it . upright position something i like , i never seen him sweat it , he seems growing room , canopy covers him fine , i think it most comfortable carry . his parents using eddie bauer i know alot people ( including me past ) use graco other brands they seem roomier , but not safe . also i haven't seen baby over 4-5 months infant seats anyways , i don't know anyone would want lug around baby over 15 pounds infant seat , i guess that just few us who aren't body builders . my nephew 11 pounds now he getting pretty heavy seat , it good thing seat isn't too heavy itself . i would recommend this seat , but i can't explain other reviews , so mabey trying it out store best everyone	1
i very impressed every avent product i purchased . i found these pacifiers so nice . they completely clear you able see smiles around them . my baby loves hers . we can't live without them	1
medela breast pump works dr. brown bottles ( you pump directly into bottle) ! just added benefit already great product . i've using mine almost daily 11 months no problems . it worth money if you plan breastfeeding/pumping more than couple months	1
we've this bed rail two months now our 3 1/2 year old his full size " big boy bed " . we're quite satisfied it . construction : very sturdy , our son jumps his bed rolls around bed rail stays put not seem like it could possibly give way . mesh soft which good times when he wedges himself corner sleep . we tug it time time it not going anywhere . assembly : not too easy , instructions horrible , but once you realize your own how it supposed go , actual assembly ok , but not quick . very easy adjust width your bed simple strap feature . hide away feature : this what took away 5th star . it not very easy unlock push it under bed . feature works but requires some wrangling . if you want hide away feature once while , i wouldn't let stop you buying it , if you plan hide rail daily , i don't recommend it . making bed : easy tuck sheets around it , no need hide away or struggle . overall , i would highly recommend this bed rail , i read all reviews , asked many friends , this seemed best all areas , good value price , considering other well over $xx	1
i love it ! this probably one my most used baby items . it so handy use while we out so easy clean . i've bought this shower gift several my pregnant friends	1

good baby monitor overall . sound quality good except we getting occasional clicking sound i can't find where interference coming	1
if you going get manual pump , get this one . i got medela hospital it sooo slow killed my hand , but this one way better . it takes 5-10 minutes get same amount it took 30 minutes get medela , it doesn't hurt your hand all because you pump handle far less often because massaging petals , because you use it less time total . i never used electric pump so i can't compare it one those , but far manuals go this one awesome	1
so far our 7 month old son likes this toy . he watches flashing lights , listens music noises , seems like different shaped blocks ( we several other peek-a-boo blocks ) . he uses handle push bus , flips up shape sorter kicks wheels make music come . it keeps his attention while he practices sitting up long periods time . we thought first we broken one since only one light worked it didn't flash . well after my husband pounded light bar down each side both lights came started flashing . it also made hood stay shut better . so maybe try before taking it back store if you encounter same problem	1
i love it sticks doesn't slide . it great my 21 month old feel part family when we eat	1
my daughter loves kick blankets off during night i always worried she would get cold , especially very cold weather we so far this winter . i saw this knew it would perfect my little kicker girl ! she wears it every night now i know she stays warm throughout night . only suggestion i anyone thinking buying this , make sure you get right size length your little one . mine growing so fast i get bigger size soon just because she getting so long	1
our little guy sleeping comfortably his stroller first several months we brought him home . when we tried transition him crib , he startled large space would cry or sleep very poorly . he outgrew stroller , we tried think ways emulate coziness stroller inside his crib ( lots attempts - not easy task !! ) . he 5 1/2 months old we now use sleep nest crib well putting him larger sized swaddleme night . he loves closeness sleeps very soundly . sleep nest small enough cozy , but large enough him move comfortably . it fits very nicely into crib also portable which great since he enjoys go	1

we purchased this gate span opening near bottom our stairs it works very well . we this gate place since my son started crawling he yet breech perimeter . my husband installed it easily ( one end into stud wall , one end into oak stair banister ) it sturdy - even my son frequently shaking it middle , it shown no signs dislodging . i give it 4 stars out 5 because it not very attractive opening mechanism somewhat cumbersome ( tough guests figure out ) . but it definitely its job i would recommend this gate anyone long span cover	1
i love this item . it really works well february winter weather . i bought 4 snowsuits i haven't used one our newborn because snowsuits tedious . i am able put her her car seat , put blanket inside put hat her . forget suits mittens . i cover her cover she sleeps dark warmth soundly . also , it prevents people touching her all time because they can't see her when i cover her up . only problem this item didn't fit well newest peg perego infant car seats . i made it work , but it doesn't fit perfectly . it worked old peg perego car seat , but not newest one . i loved this item so much i've made it work , though . it isn't perfect , but it works . it actually so much better than peg perego cover , which came car seat . this cover made my life pretty easy . i found it easy put peg perego . i love color . it zips up easily . it soft . isabella seems like snuggle it . it comfy her . aware , though , i live salt lake city , ut . our winters mild . if you colder winters , you may want add snowsuit . still , it worth money ! i am glad i bought it .	1

we these straps all over our house ( every piece furniture taller than two feet ) , because we two " climbers . " there two occasions i know where these saved my eldest daughter injury , she climbed large pieces furniture . hardest part installing these finding them . we searched several local stores , little luck - few odd looks , salespersons didn't understand why we would want strap our furniture walls when we don't live earthquake zone . but trust me , once you find somewhere sells them , buy them up . once you see how well they work , you become addicted testing see if you tip your furniture - want them everywhere .	1
i bought this my reluctant potty-trainer , he used it once tried go it several times , but real blessing his 6-year-old brother using it . i one bathroom , one very messy boy who never lifts toilet seat . this saved me clean my toilet seat constantly or face unwelcome surprises . i check collection reservoir lot , though , because my older son " go " lot , big boys . flushing mechanism works well necessary part - it saves lot time you may spend scrubbing rinsing traditional training potty . plus , pee collects part potty child doesn't easy access , unlike trainer potty they pee , then stand up step or put their head when your back turned second ( i speak experience ) . makes it much more sanitary . only problems i've encountered my kids flushing it constantly ( mostly when it new ) , simultaneously filling collection reservoir draining water therefore creating two jobs me repeat every five minutes , fact my three-year-old still can't quite get it he can't sit it #2 , fact it just little off-balance , so unless you wall-mount it or lean it up against wall , you could icky mess . luckily , ours only fallen over when filled water	1

i like fact kidsline offers extra crib sheets go zanzibar theme am impressed quality these sheets ( i two , one came bedding set one purchased off my baby registry ) . they wash extremely well ( still looks new ) , soft fit mattress appropriately . however , i think $16.99 crib sheet bit pricey purchased other crib sheets match theme just nice . ( amy coe , sage green target $8.99 koala baby sage green $9.99 bru ) . since you need several crib sheets , i just don't feel price worth it this one .	1
while these aren't waterproof , they provide enough additional protection give you little more confidence going out house underwear . so soft , little more absorbent than gerber ones . they aren't trim fit some other brands , but my son really likes roomy feel	1

we 2 kids 2-bedroom apartment . when our 2nd child born , we put him our bedroom . there not much space there , so this portable crib great find ! we use it permanent crib until our son outgrows it . pros : saves space , folds , easy move room room ( wheels ) , really easy change sheets ( compared regular crib heavy matress ) . it also very neutral color style , so it fits really well other traditional furniture . cons : baby outgrow it 1 year , matress extremely thin ( 1 inch ! ) . we bought extra matress ( normal thickness ) $20 . find it , search " portable crib matress "	1
my wife i bought this item usual reasons . we washed them no problems fuzzballs or shredding . they're just soft sturdy they before we washed them , if not little softer . record , we washed them cold cycle other baby clothes . they went through drier hour lowest heat setting . anyway , i'm just writing review offset bad review . there nothing wrong pads we received , they what they're supposed -- get warm baby cold changing table	1
we just installed these this weekend our upstairs banisters - they're great . they're strong enough keep our 11-month-old baby falling through -- we pushed pulled them after getting them all fastened . i still intend watch him carefully when he up there , but these definitely protect him emergency . just sure follow directions -- tie them tightly !! they're not bad , looks-wise , either . i still see my spindles through netting so " look " stairway basically unchanged . course , looks less important than safety ! i think i'm going get these our outdoor deck , well . i'd recommend them	1
my baby used this since she 4 months old it sturdy wide base .. it height adjusters ... you recline it .. very secure safty belts but i make sure my babies hands nowhere near it when i buckle it thats only thing i dislike this highchair . i dont find it hard clean .. it comes two trays it wheels folds up definately worth money especially now because it sale .. i paid full price :(	1
we loved this product our little girl loved it even more ! we used it time she 4 months almost 10 months . we nice wide doorway we able put jumper . we never any problems fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped . we believe her coordination better because she used this so often . just 14 months , she could jump both feet off ground . it quality product reasonable price . would highly recommend	1
i ordered 6 piece crib set plus other zanzibar items go it really pleased quality softness fabrics . it beautiful looks very nice cozy . i bigger crib later turns into twin bed , so what i make quilt bigger use fitted sheet make addition . i also used dust ruffle make bumper bigger some pillows which look great sofa i room .	1
i am first time expectant mother like most excited moms-to-be , i read pretty much all reviews every item i need register or buy baby . however , helpful hint i give comes my other half who already son used wipe warmer . he said wipe warmers heat bottom up ( heat all wipes ) waste money because time you get bottom wipes .... they dried out continuously reheated . they basically lose their moisture which defeats purpose wipe first place you end up throwing bunch them out without benefit using them first . we opted go this one because it seems smaller ( more convenient travel which we fair amount ) it heats just first few wipes which usually all you need diaper change . some mothers would say this not really necessary thing ( after all , babies lived through diaper use just fine before these things invented ) , but because our baby born during winter , i thought this would more use us . i gave this product four stars because we haven't tried it yet .... but just wanted pass helpful hint other mothers who interested practicality saving money hopefully not losing quality process	1
great organizing baby food your diaper bag . caution : not leak-proof , sure properly seal leftovers ! love slots hold spoons .	1
first time i used this shopping cart cover my daughter fell asleep ( need i say anymore) ? it fits nearly every shopping cart , it easy fold unfold , it gives me peace mind knowing all those shopping cart germs aren't coming home us ! well worth extra peace mind it gives me	1
my husband i received this changing table , 4-drawer chest monterey crib , gift our parents . we skeptical , because we wanted nursery affordable , yet not too flimsy . we pleasantly surprised once pieces put together . pieces coordinate beautifully nursery , take our soon-to-be-born infant into childhood . nicest part you don't spend thousands dollars nice nursery . my friends family constantly complimenting us how great pieces look how sturdy they . * only reason i rated this 4-stars instead 5 because two drawers rubbed together slightly once assembled . it very easily fixed adjusting drawer tracks , took 5 minutes . bottom line : if you looking beautiful , quality nursery affordable , this great choice	1
i decided this pump instead single because it saves time both sides once . this pump works very well i quickly get milk i need . i like there different levels suction fit my comfort . i gave it four stars because it little difficult change speeds adjust both hands occupied . sometimes one side looses suction while i am trying fix it other side looses suction because i remove my hand holding it place	1
i borrowed this pump mom who just used it 8 weeks she out work . i used it frequently ( least twice daily ) 5 months i pumped work . it always worked wonderfully . i never trouble let-down or supply . sometimes i filled both 8 oz . bottles 15-minute session ! unless you problems breastfeeding or milk supply , i can't imagine this pump not working great . i didn't any problems it whole time i used it	1
i love this bumper . it isn't thick like padded bumpers fits crib nicely , without bunching . price much more reasonable than $$ bumpers go bedding sets . mostly i feel secure my little one safe even if he rolls up edge railings . i know his arms legs won't get tangled railings , but he also breathe . great product . it cute too looks very nice white crib .	1
i purchased this my 17 month old son who normally sleeps crib . i told daycare he would entering uses cots . so figuring this would also good travel , i bought it . my son loves it ! whole thing like mesh beach chair . i put it together 8 seconds . removable fitted sheet comes it -is soft . entire thing easy wipe clean . it looks comfy . it says it good kids up 75lbs . 52 inches . ( good know ) my favorite feature how tiny it folds up - pretty light compared other cots . not nearly bulky , too ! nice royal blue colors	1
i bought this item based safety comfort reviews consumer reports i'd say reviews i read titan dead . my 7 month old very long his age he loves freedom this seat provides opposed cramped car seat we using . i also like fact he grows into toddler able sit forward i still use this seat - i wish i bought this seat get go	1
my son now 2 bottle baby . we atleast 10 different cups he always refused them screamed his bottle . lastnight we bought this terrific cup he not asked bottle yet ! i now putting bottles away good this time ! i ordering few more so we always one hand . they pricey , but if i wouldn't bought all other cups , i'd plenty money saved just buying these first place !	1
my baby now 5 months old , we've using halo sleep sac since she started moving around more . i always worried regular blanket because more than few times she would wake up crying because she kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now , i never worry she soffocate or she cold middle night . this product really gives me peace mind i'll sure give this any new parent friends	1
this wonderful stroller . i'm so glad i took chance ordered it , sight unseen . i ordered red version , which much snazzier person than amazon picture . it fairly lightweight - much lighter than our graco model , but heavier than those cheap little umbrella strollers , nice sturdy . but it folds up umbrella fashion , so it won't take up too much room your trunk could carried , if necessary . it comes neat things like rain cover , sun shade , cold weather boot . rain shade covers neatly contained attachable pouch boot fits easily stroller baske t.t he canopy window , provides lots shade , even partially removable let breeze run through balmy day . coolest all , it built mesh pouch doesn't take up any room but still manages hold everything i need : sunscreen , hand sanitizer , wallet , keys , cell phone , sunglasses . it stretchy mesh , so if you don't anything it just lies flat against hood . but it plastic lining , so it waterproof ! also , it zips , so your things can't fall out aren't accessible your two year old , either . basket large enough medium sized diaper bag , although small bag would fit best , especially if you want keep boot there . best part everything snazzy . everything looks nice , materials feel great , it well designed . parts should removable/washable . it snap put together ( took just couple minutes ) everything locks into place smart way . it very easy fold unfold . also , it reclines beautifully easily , including into totally upright position . i became frustrated my graco model most upright position still too reclined our one year old . place where your child legs hang down neat . it adjustable , so it could stick straight out , hang down , or even flip up very little one ( maybe use boot ? ) ... your kid won't get weird stroller mark underside their little knees . it newer style which i notice most new strollers seem where you only clip two things buckle baby . my graco model ( purchased last year ) such complicated mess . you attach two things together one side , two things together other side , then connect each side into center . arg ! my son almost always fussed time i'd finished . also , he always sitting one straps , which easily became twisted . my husband still not figured out how this quickly . :) so this big improvement . it also comfy ! i can't vouch myself , course . but my son settles down into it looks perfectly comfortable . graco model , he ended up his legs flung over one side tray if he wasn't tightly belted he slouched down lot . few minor imperfections zooper twist . cupholder mesh bag attached handle . it works well standard water bottle or something , but one those giant mall-sized beverages might not so great . you easily remedy this investing good quality cup attachment , if important you . this stroller great me - i'm 5'5 . it would nice if stroller handles adjustable . this isn't jogging stroller . it offer nice feature where you lock front two wheels so they not swivel , which makes going over rough surfaces safer easier manage . this isn't kind stroller going hold everything but kitchen sink , if you looking kind stroller . there isn't cup snack tray your child . no clock . this just greatest stroller i'm so glad dump our awful graco stroller . hated . . thing . this snazzy , well designed , handy , lightweight , convenient , offers everything we need	1

i got this car seat my 10 month old daughter . i concerned it would too large my car ( i honda civic ) , but it fit just fine . rear-facing you would need put center back seat , so if you 2 kids , you would put seats up further , but if you short , likely not issue . i it installed fire station it fit perfectly -- he installed it minutes not need any foam pieces make it fit properly ! it perfect fit its own . pros : 1 . it best car seat you get ! 2 . side impact protection -- also makes good headrest when baby falls asleep3 . adjust knob harness awesome adjust especially over large coats4 . seat very well cushioned , soft fabric5 . fits fine small car even rear facing ( i civic)6 . it heavy so its not going anywhere ! 7 . works up 65 pounds , so we get lot use out seat8 . she loves it ! cons : 1 . it large/heavy ( though it staying my car so heavy not problem)2 . strap tighted harness little tough pull tight smaller child , but you need pull straight out not up3 . it expensivei highly recommend this seat ( we onyx fabric ) . it large , heavy expensive , but it best !! i buyer remorse few minutes , but i figured it best seat market right now $300 small price pay protecting my daughter . i lot research before buying felt confident my decision seat ! very pleased this seat ! also , please make sure you get your seat installed certified technician ( check your local children hospital ) . improperly installed car seats improper use car seats leading cause death among children infants . something very easy prevent	1
after 2 nights no sleep because our 18 months old son figured out how flip himself out pack play ( just sheer upper body strength ! )i so relieved find this crib tent it pain put together ( it took 20 minutes ) but well worth it because it works ... he stayed pack play didn't seem care all he " trapped " , i think kids like playfulness tent . my 4 year old jealous ! there few downsides ... its pain set up break down if your using pack play over nights travel it isn't portable could ... i older pack play , its ' 02 when we our first baby so ends higher than sides so clips no where clip onto but it hasn't mattered . side clips enough keep our strong toddler place . overall product expensive pain set up but priceless because it lets whole family sleep soundly safely !	1
great success . i love all kiddapotamus products , i bought so far because they well-done , thoughtful win awards all time - but best all , they really very handy . we went restaurant first time we could put our sons food right placemat table so he could feed himself . without mat , we hold onto food or but napkin underneath - so one us always busy our son instead enjoying dinner out . placemat comes scoop holds most food our son drop his mat floor still clean after we left . best all this mat we provide germfree space him sit , eat play - our table . he really happy it . after our visit we rolled this wonderful placemat together put it my handbag . i really satisfied	1
i got this product b/c when we first put our daughter highchair when we went out eat she immediately wanted touch table . i fine it until i wiped table off disgusted what i saw . tables most restaruants aren't always cleaned clean rags . now , she older eating some puffs other finger foods , it great b/c i put food directly her mat cup catches leftovers ! i keep ours large ziploc bag my diaper bag so when it dirty it doesn't get everything else dirty . it such simple concept product , but so great ! only complaint i sometimes it doesn't stick very well .....	1

i completely understand your concern . although , if you read instructions any mobile , when child old enough sit or stand crib ( around 6 months ) , you supposed take it off . they not built anyone play them . my son liked his mobile so much when he old enough reach it , we took it off my husband attached it top his hutch . this way we still able play song , but he couldn't reach it . i think this mobile perfect way add room theme . those who looking buy this mobile , or any other mobile : go store where you buying your crib , try it out . people babies us must thought i nuts , because i took quilt mobile set i wanted took them crib i buying . i able determine if mobile would fit before i bought it , i got see how colors bedding looked color crib . this eliminated lot hassle me later taking mobile back if it didn't fit	1
i purchased baby einstein discover play center keep office days my then-5-mnth-old son , toby , me work . he immediately loved musical buttons sun , ignored everything else . he grew , he discovered other toys one one . it exciting watch him perfecting different skills necessary manipulate activities . because i used baby einstein secure place meals , it needed regular cleaning . seat pops right off easy cleaning , but cloth saddle little hard unsnap base . overall , assembly pretty easy - i put it together myself i am not mechanically inclined . i definitely recommend baby einstein activity center . i looked several other brands turned off all obnoxious toys activities . i wanted something toby could learn , not just dazzled bells whistles . i can't say toby learned any spanish language buttons , but baby einstein kept my son engaged even 11 months , when his willingness stay one place usually short-lived .	1

ok so how many people think their baby exceptional ? well , pretty much everyone i know , they all right course . each baby exceptional , their own way . but how many babies rated exceptional pediatricians , nurses early childhood educators ? well , i know one - mine ! i faithfully used babyplus system when i pregnant . one time when using it , he started knocking back . yeap , i actually felt him knock back it , rhythm . it only happened once , but i told my husband i think this going one special kid . i 7 months pregnant then . well , lo behold , after he born people ( professionals ) don't stop telling us how amazing he . he most aware newborn you ever meet . he 2 months old now , sleeping through night ( 11 hours time ) since he 2 weeks . he cries when he needs something , never cries no reason ( but i make sure respond quickly his needs so i don't know how much it . ) . yesterday he started reaching objects . can't quite grab them yet , but it doesn't stop him trying . pediatrician nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he , how aware he seems fact he vocalizes music unheard this age . he holding his head up since day he born ( 3 days late ) making eye contact since 2 weeks . so , i don't really know what if anything baby plus system it . i mean it could just accident but ... all i say i definitely use this product our future children . i would pay thousands if i ( we not rich people ) because its worth every penny	1

fan baby einstein line products , i put this my registry . what great gift it turned out . it could entertain my daughter when nothing else ! she now 16 months old too big it , but when she started watching baby einstein videos , she recognized characters this center	1
i 2 activity centers different makers ( other grandmas house)so i something compare this . i honestly say this this activity center worth extra 15-20 dollars you might spend . begin , seat swivels easily baby move one activity next . might not important issue older babies but my daughter 4 months old when she started use this compared other exersaucer , it really makes differnce seat she maneuver . toys attachments great quality offer variety skills baby learn entertained . i can't say enough positive things this activity center . i highly recommend it it both stimulating entertaining baby .	1
our little one loved this toy until he turned 8 months . now its really challenge try get him into this thing or baby einstein stationary entertainer ( see my review ) . however , he still play it standing outside loves touching legs toys chewing bar . unfortunately he puts up fight when we try get him it . but we good run this it worth it . he would bounce back forth say " ahhhhhhh !

i got this blanket accompany toddler set my daughter 3rd birthday . while toddler bedding set isn't highest quality world , this blanket ultra soft my daughter loves it	1
we've using this three weeks now don't single complaint ( yet ) . we love fact it plug-in too ! our little girl mesmerized mobile music almost hypnotizing ( surprisingly good quality ) . we don't use tray or restraints so we swaddle her before putting her down , she usually fast asleep within minutes . once she starts interacting toys , we'll use activity tray i'm sure she'll enjoy well . only downside swing motor make noise , but sound relatively minimal easily tuned out . i would rated it 5 stars , but color not optimal -- we're not huge fans pink , would rather chosen blue swing stars if it weren't $40 more	1
beautiful swing . my baby absolutely loves it !! there so many options choose like way she swings , lights , butterflies moving , songs played . i say she comfortable enough take naps it . very strong sturdy . swing deep enough where baby won't fall out . once again beautiful product i love my baby loves . thanks amazon !	1
i love this stroller ! first all , it comes fun , non-gender specific colors , unlike so many baby items . second , it extremely lightweight easy unfold one-handed ( even while holding baby ) . third , proportions stroller perfect ! my husband i test-drove many umbrella strollers found we usually kicked wheels ( he 6 feet tall , while i am 5'6 " ) , but we don't maclaren . also , handles tall enough he not hunched over pushing stroller . there lot other great features , too . there carry strap great transporting stroller . mesh seat keeps baby cool summer , we purchased " volo accessory pack " which solid , padded seat liner which we use winter keep baby warm . i recommend getting accessory pack , which also rain cover carry-bag stroller . basket under seat small side ( forget fitting diaper bag there ) but i don't mind carrying diaper bag because stroller so lightweight manuverable . my only other issue sun canopy not tilt very far forward . overall , we very satisfied maclaren volo	1
this stroller wonderful . i initially bought it strictly travel but love its ease use so much it used daily . pros : lightweight , great carrying strap , easily folds , takes up very little space your trunk , turquoise great unisex color . cons : once it folded you not lean it up against something without it falling . carrying strap this not big deal . this very minor issue not keep me recommending this stroller all my friends family .	1

this breat pump life saver . i used when i working par t-t ime even during full-time pump never failed me . its easy use , doesn't hurt all , not mention it very fast . i remember pumping 10 onces 10-12 minutes . clean up absolute breeze best part i could fit pump my little purse no one would ever know . my daughter used playtex bottles so i used liners playtex one step storage system attached it medela pump . this worked like charm didn't transfer milk one bottle . this pump worth every penny .	1

unlike other reviews , i find these bags easy use convenient . twist ties allow you pump right into bag which saves me wash bottles everytime i pump . other bags require you pump into bottle then pour it into bag which defeats whole purpose . medela bags also allow you get all air out which destroy great quality your milk if left inside . i store bags upright ( just case , although i've never leaky bag ) milk storage tray i bought babies us ( first years brand ) . once they frozen , i put them ziplock bags date written them easy retrieval when i need defrost milk . when i am ready defrost , i just stand them upright large bowl let cold water run 5 minutes , them pour into bottles . my baby never got hang breastfeeding , but i really wanted her breastmilk . she 2 1/2 months old now , i pumping milk since she 3 days old . i eventually chose bottlefeed exclusively , so i pump 5 times day . i use entire pack 50 bags less than week !!! i pump way more than she eats , so i lot stored milk . plently when i go back work can't pump often . take it someone who really knows . these bags not difficult use everyone else you believe . if they , i wouldn't use them considering how often i need use them .	1
we saw someone using these they appeared perfectly suited keeping young children nearby without carrying them or strapping them into strollers . kids parents all happy . so we ordered 6 : two us ( 2 grandchildren ) 1 each all parents other grandparents .	1

these great , we actually them couple different sizes so my son grow into them . ( note : we got him blue one , but they make you review them separately)here what i love : 1 . our house gets chilly night , even little space heater his room , i worried him cold no blankets ! sleep sack snuggly warm . 2 . our son moves constantly , awake or asleep . any blanket you use ( even if it safe ) would never stay him . sleep sacks never tangled or bunched up under him . 3 . this silly , but it just looks so darling . i love see him all ready bed , his pjs sleep sack . our son hated sleepers sacks bottom , i think they felt restrictive because he would kick kick them cry . he never minded sleep sack , maybe his pjs under it helps him feel more comfy . i recommend this , recommend getting couple each size so you throw one wash ready .	1
i started out various brands bottles when my baby born . my baby developed colic 5 weeks old . i wanted bottle prevented air bubbles least possible . avent bottles okay , but i tried dr. brown bottles . you see results immediately ! you see absolutely no air bubbles going into nipple or even bottle . no other bottle i've seen compares . result , my colicky baby less gas stomach pain . far extra time clean gadgets , oh please , no big deal ! it matter extra minute your day few bottles . it little strange 1st ( all gadgets ) , but no time it no big deal i promise ! i always highly recommend dr. brown bottles !	1
these great bottles ! i these some medela bottles came my breast pump . dr. browns wins -- no doubt it ! i guess i'm not meticulous some other reviewers cleaning sterilizing ... i just follow directions package sterlized when i started out then i've hand washed ever since . now , let face it , washing bottles pain regardless . washing few more parts no big deal . it takes me approx . 30 seconds more vent parts . it definitely worth effort . couple times i've used medela bottles i could visibly see bubbles coming through milk rising top . later my baby lots gas spit up . dr browns bottles never happens . i don't even use medelas backup " emergency " bottles anymore . i only use them hold water if i'm taking trip need bring some clean water home mix formula . dr browns bottles godsend	1

i love this stroller . i would recommend it anyone . my son high tone would arch really bad regular umbrella strollers , because it only buckled around his waist fabric not very sturdy . this one 5 point harness , heavy material keeps him arching . it also taller than most umbrella strollers so you not break your back pushing it . i absolutely love it .	1
i market nice umbrella stroller . i shopped around asked other moms what they like . this stroller very light pushes so easily ! so many expensive ones bad reviews .... reclining position plus well !	1

i used these bottles my first son would given them 3.5 stars . i would first tell you if they not fixed just right they would leak . after trying all others once again my daughter i decided use these . when i went buy new nipples i noticed they looked different . oh , wow , what diffrence . baby 4 months old no leaks . new nipples raised edge guarantees nipple tight collar . then there lip hugs rim bottle guard against leaks . really great thing you tighten these bottle your hearts content . i tightened it tight i could it didn't leak bit . new nipples words " extra soft " package if you look closely they look different around bottom . i am extremely satisfied these bottles now use them untill baby weaned .	1
these only bottles our daughter use . i really love them , but wish they weren't so wide it so hard get her hold them herself now she old enough try . i problem leaking occasionally when i've shaken bottle mix milk around .	1

[ ... ] i also found it easiest put it when first folding wrap half lengthwise , then spreading it out when secure . though it not easy nurse baby this carrier , it pretty easy take them out put them back once you used sling . if i it my way i would this ( long periods up , fussy babies , or those bad backs ) , sling ( newborns nursing ) , backpack ( only short trips , like laundry or carrying groceries up ) . if i pick one however this above all would it !! one more thing , it ok wear this warm weather , just dress accordingly ( you your baby ) . pocket plus well . oh , i find it easier , once , get baby out than back pack or front carrier . this also suitable right off bat new borns many stages there after	1
i never much luck traditional baby carriers . ones i tried uncomfortable wear hurt my back shoulders . it also never seemed like my daughter got truely comfortable . i love this wrap because it it versatility ( which something most carriers lack ) reasonably priced . soft , stretchy fabric , which great , provides even weight distribution makes my daughter feel safe secure . after watching dvd , using wrap very easy practical . my daughter especially likes front facing position , it really lets her explore world . i believe using wrap allowed us bond much more great new ways . after searching testing various products this best ! i highly recommend this product .	1
my daughter tried several bottles our granddaughters who both acid reflux . these greatest bottles only bottles helped them gas upset stomaches . they also great if you need add cereal their milk because acid reflux . wide bottles great this . you should only fill bottles up 8oz line you won't any problems bottles leaking . i would recommend these bottles anyone especially parents acid reflux babies .	1
i bought this wipe warmer my son right after he born because he hated diaper changes . so , i thought it coldness wipes upset him . my son now 4 months old , ever since we got it , we no problems quot ; fitsquot ; during diaper changes . not 1 ! it doesn't stay quot ; hotquot ; very long after you take it out warmer , but it still warm . i never problem it would reccommend it everyone ... especially mom boys .	1
i just received this warmer shower gift . i hesitant register it beginning because so many negative reviews . however , after trying it out , i've found it pretty decent product . it true wipes warm only couple seconds , but really , how long it take wipe baby off ? owners manual states warmer not meant produce hot wipes . i think it great something remove chill wipes , which should comforting baby . when i first used it , i didn't add water suggested manual , just see how it would work . wipes start dry out after awhile but then i added 1/2 cup water haven't noticed any more drying . all wipes still moist . i haven't noticed any discoloration either i am using huggies wipes . my baby hasn't arrived yet but i wanted try this out see myself how well it or not work . i think when he get here couple weeks , he thankful i used decently warm wipe instead cold one	1

my son big baby , checking over 9 pounds 22 inches , but headrests came carseat still didn't offer enough support . we fortunate received this product our baby shower . he looked so cozy fleece side cuddling him he very well supported . now it over 80 degrees , we've flipped it over use cooler fabric he still loves it . my son almost 8 weeks old , so we tried taking it out our carseat just using headrest came carseat . but , it still doesn't offer enough support . once he falls asleep , his little head just hung over side , so we put snuzzler back he much happier . it bit trickier get car seat straps safely adjusted around support , but after few days we hang it .	1
my baby loves this toy ! 4 months old i bring it us when we go out . he falls sleep quickly when i just set it front him rotate it around , he hears rattles it soothes him . fish beads it , cylinder thing spiral around it which facinates him little stars which make neat rattle . round sphere mirror it which swivels little ribbon pieces stick out making little more touch/feel interest flat piece holographic fish it swims when you move it . all all it his favorate toy . it good job when suctioned glass top table , but come off anything else . :) oh well ...	1

my son wearing halo sleep sack since day he came home hospital . winter baby it best thing world know he would warm not worry loose blankets . he began sleeping through night 7 weeks old . i think sleep sack gives him feeling security . he never able sleep without it . he now 30 months old still won't go sleep unless he his sleep sack . we friend ours who seamstress add additional material bottom because he became tall it . how much he loves his sleep sack . it far best thing i ever bought my son	1
these so awesome ! i never concern my son cold or get strangled blankets . one night i sleep sak laundry it cool night , so i put blanket over him - well my husband checked him middle night found blanket wrapped so tightly around his neck he could hardly believe our son still breathing . very scary . so if anything , make sure you more than one sleep sak .	1
i bought this pump lactation consultant our child pediatrician office . after i went back work , it proved excellent purchase . i able pump discreetly work cool my milk attached cooler . if we took trip , i could take pump pump car using battery attachment or even our hotel room . one time pump not suctioning properly . when i called medela , they so helpful . they assistemd me while i phone get it working properly . it still didn't work so they offered me new pump exchange my old one . andreaetta [ ...	1
i read other reviews find some differing opinions . i loved this pump because it very effective my needs . i used it everyday work 6 months . it took 20 minutes express milk i bags go pump accurately measure milk . also , i able use one arm hand hold cups place while i made phone calls other . i can't imagine pump more effective	1
you ever tried get your infant into jacket , snowsuit or thick blanket then into carseat straps ? not so easy huh ? well this fabulous product saved me headache - although i tried just see if it really difficult ! i love i put my now 9 month old into carseat bundle me zip her up ! thats it ! front covers her face if it windy she warm cozy inside ! especially cold days or when she dressed cute rather than cold i put extra blanket her inside bundle me she cant throw it off ! i lite version which i used all spring summer ( air conditioned car ) now this one fall winter ! some commented how easy it move baby bundle me carseat stroller - i disagree i would just get second one stroller . velcro back holds it into carset wake up sleeping baby if you try remove whole thing baby inside . great product	1
this urban bundle me one best baby items i've bought my son ! it much more convenient than struggling keep blanket car seat . if baby gets too warm just unzip cover off ! i like this version much better than original bundle me , which seems like it would get too warm my baby . material urban bundle me warm enough rainy washington weather but not too warm like fleece original bundle me . i also love little pocket where i store emergency pacifier or other small items . it washes great i plan buy larger toddler size once my son outgrows this . one minor problem zipper occasionally gets stuck , but that expected when zipper isn't zipped straight line . =)	1
we used avent our first son almost 5 years ago . i run into some leaking problems came white cap screwing onto bottle . i found if i tightened bottle bit more it eliminated leaks completely . after figuring this out , we no more problems . we expecting our second child few months i started buy avent again . our first son not whole lot gas problems . course he gassy times , so i can't say he no gas , but he didn't appear so much gas where it bothering him . i really liked wide bottle avent . it made it more comfortable me hold then later when our son got old enough wide bottle made it easy him hold . avent also handles attach bottles when your baby/toddler gets old enough hold bottle themselves . handles wide colorful made holding easy little hands . nipples i feel first bit hard , but our son never any problems taking it . course , this vary amoung babies . after just purchasing 3 pack 4 oz bottles impending baby #2 i opened up package after seeing advertisement " extra soft nipple " it indeed softer then it 5 years ago . if you looking save money , i suggest either buying very few 4oz bottles or simply buying 9 oz or even 11 oz bottles instead they outgrow 4 oz very quickly . we no problems cleaning these bottle well they held up very well . we never replace them .	1
we love handle this car seat . i owned graco snug ride hated it --- it not snap into supermarket shopping cart . handle triangle shape you carry it forward , backward , or against your hip . love it , bought one my second child again my last child when first one expired	1
pros : great music , high/low volume choice , light show ceiling plus , my daughter loves listen/watch it every night she falls asleep ! cons : strap broke after 2 moves ( but if you contact baby einstein co . they send you new one free charge ) , wish it just on/off ( switch button 1 song play vs . all songs play)all all , i like this because it works my daughter .	1
i love dr . brown bottles . bigger ones closer breast so its easy switch back forth . i like comfort grip also	1
hi , i no idea if these bottles help colic/gasey baby . my baby never like . i considered these bottles because i hated my son suck till he could suck no more then let go nipple so air could back into regualar bottle . so i started looking bottle didn't nipple collaspe . first we tried playtex . they worked but extremely hard mix powdered formula because liners held exactly 8 oz ( also expensive liners ) . then i switched avent , thought it my dream come true bottle . until they started leaking no matter how i screwed ring . i finally figured out problem , skirts nipples warp after very little use . so i ended up constantly buying new nipples never knowing when we would get whole bottle dumped us . so then dr brown came out these wide neck bottles . after some reading directions trial error ; this it : bottle us !! this how we it ; you can't use valve while mixing formula or warming or bottle leak . so water goes bottle just ring , nipple cap get screwed . valve goes zip-lock bag . ten minuetes before bottle needed . i but formula bottle shake . ten minuets all bubbles down i incert valve feed . no leaks . i aunt who premixes her formuala two days worth bottles puts them fridge ( once again leaving valves out ) . then she gets them out , swirls little , takes off top , microwaves 30 secs , incerts valve , checks tempreture feeds . no leaks either . only time i ever leak when i mixed or heated formula valves which directions say not . like i said this what works best us	1
i found this sheet work very well my pack play pad . it just slips over bottom it stays very well . i don't know other play pens , but this great product use pack ' play	1
this great tub any baby able sit up their own . it perfect size room your little one grow . it not only saves water you would use fill larger tub but gives your little one sense security . when i tried our baby big tub he cried didnt like it so i tried him back his infant tub he fine . i realized it matter security him . large tub just so over-whelming . he loves squeek duck play tossing rings . price just right ! just careful when you inflate tub because it inflates sections . my husband used air compressor thinking it all one compartment fill air it blew up	1

we switch this warmer very disappointed first year night day warmer . this one least not burn our hands when taking out bottle . water inside not come boiling point . it still overheat bottle if you leave bottle too long . light not seem helpful . it keeps temperate too high level . however compare first year one , you not precisely accurate water level ( which pain when you use first year one 3am your sleepy eyes ) you not get mess water around table , so i'd recommend this product . also , warmer kind make ' tick ' noise when it so it becomes reminder warmer still , which good thing	1
we bought one these quilted sacks ( fleece one cotton one ) when our daughter born winter . it felt like we goldilocks .... fleece kept our baby too warm , cotton kept her too cold , but quilted sack just right . reviewer said , fabric big " clingy " , however , it just slight annoyance benefits far outweigh irritation . ( besides , i found fleece ones extremely static-y cotton sacks wrinkle into little ball dryer . )	1
this neat little spout cover . hat duck lifts so you pour bubble bath into it , so it slowly drizzles make alot bubbles . would recommend	1

if you baby , you pretty much one these or least something very similar . bjorn original i think key their popularity simplicity design . lot other brands added things ( e.g. pockets , extra buckles or straps , multiple carrying positions , etc . ) try differentiate . bjorn kept it simple . both my partner i use same one ( easily adjusts different size people ) pretty much everywhere including sweeping mopping floors . boy loves facing forward where he see everything . hope this isn't edited : look around cheaper prices . they release new patterns every year many places discount previous years patterns	1
i received this baby bjorn gift before my first child born february 2004 . i used it her up through 9 months age . then when we our second child , i pulled it out it best thing . she loves it it saved me put her down when i am chasing my first child who now 2 year old . i recommend any new mom one it such great quality it lasts long long time , it worth money . if we decide child i definitely pulling it out again . mom 2 little girls	1

i don't know reason bad reviews , this fits pp mattress very snugly , held up well 3 years now ; i just took them out wash our new baby they're still great shape , just tiny bit pilling fabric . no , they're not waterproof , so get pad underneath it .	1
i purchased this sheet two years ago my son graco pack ' play . no , it isn't waterproof- but i never come across sheet . however , i recommend purchasing bru especially baby brand waterproof pad go underneath it ( just like you would real mattress ! ) . when placed over pad , sheet lies flat , instantly your pnp mattress protected ! this only sheet i would recommend use graco pack ' play because it made just this ! port-a-crib sheets different , don't lie flat or fit snug- therefore , i don't feel they safe . this sheet easy launder not shrink- it fit every time ! i liked this sheet so much i'd buy it again- i ! i am expecting twins , so i purchased second one my second pnp !	1

i never written review before , but after 4 months using flash ex stroller i encourage more users ! i tried others ' car seat strollers they not nearly light easy this one . i love it folds thirds , because you travel it your car it fits into overhead compartment airplane , which means it won't suffer insults baggage handling . i use it safe seat , which fits wonderfully without any adjustments ( just use seatbelt ! ) . only downside underside basket small , but i think small portability ease use ( including carrier strap ) makes it very worthwhile . my favorite baby purchase so far	1
i love this stroller ! its lightweight durable . my son also enjoys this stroller ( i think it because he see mommy ! ) i would highly recommend this stroller ! :	1
i tried 3 other mattress pads , none them held up more than couple washings shrinking ripping . this pad actually fits mattress ! finally ! well worth money . not waterproof , but since crib mattress , i didn't need waterproof mattress pad . great quality , worry free product delivers promised !	1

i bought blue one my baby so i could see change her diapers middle night without turning bright lights . i keep it my nightstand carry budy her crib . it safe set it down crib next her . it comes automatically when you pick it up its base shuts off again when you set it back down base . base magnetic , so don't keep it close any electonics like tvs or computers . i love it so much i bought orange one my stepson room . orange one glows red when light . then i bought three more gifts various friends family young children . today , i went ahead bought green one myself . they stay lit 10 hours so it great all power outages we get here winter . i also use it get ready bed or find things my room night while my husband sleeping since he gets up go work much earlier than me . it bright enough help me find my way around dark but not bright enough wake him or baby . it also great guest night light . it very soft glow doesn't hurt your eyes when you need get up middle night .	1
i love this mobile so much i ended up buying one my 3 month old niece . they love it too !! this one best mobiles because movements colors well fact you still little night light music box when you detatch mobile part . not mention it plays music close 20 minutes . my 13 month old loves it ( so my 4 year old ) . he just mesmerized it when he tired amused it when he wakes up turns it after he sleeping . i little reluctant this mobile when i read some reviews it too quiet . i wanted set record straight . mobile quiet ... but it baby you trying lull them sleep so how loud you want it ? i think volume perfect but if you prefer make it louder or house loud you switch it louder volume but we always keep it softest it just fine . i highly recommend this mobile	1
i compared reviews this mobile tinylove mobile called symphony motion fisher price ocean wonders mobile . i really like fact symphony motion award winning but biggest drawback one fact it actually keep babies awake because how active it . i like ocean wonders mobile because ceiling projection but drawback there people said you pretty much room pitch black dark see those images well . since we keep night light our little one , we decided against one too . end , we chose fisher price rainforest mobile because it seemed most soothing we not disappointed . she tries hard stay awake watch leaves go colorful animals go round round . but there something slow speed rotation jungle noise and/or classical music just makes her drowsy everytime . my husband i very pleased this purchase	1
good size . easy setup . colorful design . no frills	1
if we would known this available earlier , we wouldn't bought smaller play-yard we replaced this . our son , who 21 months 90 percentile height weight , just loves this play-yard we love fact he safer more comfortable than ever before . we very pleased quality , size , portability , color scheme . this far best money we spent child related item . we highly recommend this item we confident you pleased it just we .	1
we live small military base overseas . my first stroller got all moldy storage , so we purchased this one when new baby came . my 3 year old loves stroller , he calls it his spaceship , or his horse depending day his mood . he hasn't sat stroller since he learned how walk , but he ride this all day long . my newborn loves stroller much any newborn loves something . it handels very well , even uneven cobblestone walkways . everyone base comments how cool stroller , several friends babies way considering purchasing one their own . we love it sort glad our old one got moldy , so we could get new one . : -	1
i received these friend detroit , mi when my son only baby . he now 16 months old these table toppers become indespensible . mcdonalds , fish camp , back yard burgers , even finest restaurants . they stick very well even if he pulls them , they stuck . good thing they not pull off finish ! he loves ones blues clues we go over characters fruits printed them while we waiting our food . keep couple snack size zippy bag put them diaper bag . full bag just too big . yourself your little one favor get bunch these . makes this mommy feel much better not getting germy	1
i going keep receiver our office which lot computer equipment . we bought 900 mhz monitor because most our equipment runs 2.4 ghz . we hoping there would less interference . we surprised very pleased how well this monitor worked . receiver produces faint hum , but overall , reception clear . every now then , i hear clicking sound over receiver , but i'm not sure if it monitor or hot air humidifier i keep baby room . we definitely pleased this purchase	1
this one toy i brought amazon not problem . my son loves it price right	1
friend lent me hers i thought ' what am i going use this since i intended baby his crib right away . ' well , i c-section getting out bed twenty times night not feasible , nor comfortable . any woman who c-section really needs this item	1
this great sleeper , but unfortunately it too small our 2.5 month old son almost overgrown it . he loves sleep it feels everywhere home if he sleep his little bed . if there " extending " option we would very very happy , but way it we only use it couple weeks	1
my 2 yr old son not interested potty training until this . we bought this potty chair it instantly got his attention . he went not going potty going potty all time . i bought one my sister- -law who 2 boys she trying potty train couldn't keep them interested only big mess within 2 weeks this totally got her boys track . so i would absolutly reccomend this anyone troubles or struggling potty training little boys , combo this peter potty unbeatable quick getting task . when we started my son this , within week 1/2 he boxers going all day night no troubles . you really appreciate this !! good luck !	1
this my first review-only because i disagree all negative reviews this this potty chair so wonderful . this potty easy clean very easy little ones use all themselves . my son 3 4 months(and he big his age ) this potty not too little him . he loves music it not distracting him or too much fun . i however not use splash guard i didn't see need so i dont know if it falls off easily or not . we tried everything potty train him this chair letting him go without pants or diapers or making sure his training pants easy him pull up down only thing worked . he gets use it himself he even dumps it into real toilet afterwards he gets very excited it	1
i admit i shocked read all negative reviews this stroller . i loved it day my daughter born , almost 2 years ago , am now using it my son . it very lightweight easy steer . i never problem maneuvering it through mall or stores , even tightest spaces . my daughter loves she sit forward see world around her , i love she buckled into 5 point harness same time !!! after 2 years pretty constant use tossed into pulled out my car trunk my husband truck , stroller still looks brand new . fabric easy clean very durable . i understand remarks cup holder basket small side . if these particular features your " most important " list , i might think buying full-sized stroller or travel system , not one italian brands . europeans just don't understand our fascination gallon-sized cup holders enormous storage baskets ... just look their cars you'll understand . however , if you're looking stroller function well both your everyday standard stroller your travel lightweight stroller , go aria .	1
my daughter really enjoyed this mat . beginning she would just sort check out fish(she looooves fish ) , but over time her ability interact it greatly increased . now-4mnths- she pushes around fish great joy even making fun bubbles . it great first tummy time toy . pillow velcros so you remove it if your little one wants practice holding themselves up or just wash . far new water everyday thing goes . i good beginning believing it might turn green or fog up or something . it turns out nothing horrible happen if you don't change it very often . actually ability empty it helpful if you plan taking it say grandma house . very easy roll up take unlike our playmat . little sun could easier activate bubble noise . little hard little bitty ones . toys still good crinkling chewing though .	1
$35 or so , this good value . rails sturdy enough keep kid rolling out bed , even if it not set up exactly right . length adjusts easily . it hard keep straps fastened correctly underneath mattress , though , especially if it heavy mattress . they supposedly fold down sides , too , but i still haven't able get mechanism work	1
i highly recommend this gate actually purchased 3 them , 2 online 1 store . very versatile different width sections which added . really like extra height they used puppy who really jump !! also like ability swing gate either direction	1
i'm surprised see so many negative reviews . we wore this sling both babies , even when they toddlers wanted carried ( try snuggli ! ) i always kept one hand newborn ( i wanted , anyway ) , but daddy didn't . they grew , sling accommodated different positions tug strap : front facing , side hip , my back so i could work kitchen . fit easily over any layers . best feature : we could transfer sleeping baby ( or toddler ) one caregiver , or lay sleeping child down nap , without jiggling wee one out carrier or wrestling readjusting multiple carrier straps fit different sized people . our babysitters friends wore this sling , too	1
i bought nojo sling before my daughter born feb 2002 looking forward using it breastfeeding getting around without hassel stroller or carseat . it best friend i needed new mother . life so much easier it still . my daughter two i use this sling still she grown so much more since then . thanks nojo making life me my husband so easy fun . malls grocery stores never same . plus mopping our home made easier because she just holds watches safe out way her sling , which also like her blankie . thank you , jennifer celeste miami , florida	1
i safety 1st walker similar ( winnie pooh ) my girl loves it . fact , she doesn't want her hop pop much because she scoots around her walker . i got my walker kmart ( you change batteries hunny pot ) . i wasn't going get her walker all just use her hop pop but she seems really like it .	1
i bought this safe padded sheet my four month baby , it perfecto safe sheet breathe . good quality , nice price	1
soft , easy attach , absorbs well , don't lift mattress change , still see cute sheet side crib	1
i only wish crayons thicker so they wouldn't break so quickly ! i purchased this my 20 month old she absolutely loves this . she comes shower when i'm it saying " color " tries get just color it wall ! i put her shower let her color while i shower , then get out , let her continue color while i'm getting dried off then bathe her . she actually hates getting out bathtub now!i'd recommend this anyone children who love draw or color . crayon marks easily removed off any tile or ceramic tub ( though i don't know how well it would work those plastic/laminate ones ) side compartments hold crayons holes so crayons dry , there no crayons lying all over bathtub . most used christmas gift yet ( even loved my 9 year old son ! )	1
3 yr old fighting each night take bath , now asks take bath . great toy . adult needed open crayon compartments ( i hard time -- nothing grasp ) , but she learned hold them open keep closing . crayon suprisingly dark , yet easy rub off . she cleans surface herself wash cloth	1
i bought this my 2 month old christmas . my baby loves it . my baby sit it hours	1
my son daughter-in-law report all baby bottles they've tried , dr. brown natural flow bottles easiest use , my grandson much easier time any possible after-effects bottle feeding times	1

i love it ! my son sit table us take nap . he only 2 months old . it looks great our family years come . easy set up i love fact it trasition into toddler seat	1
we bought this because our son quickly outgrowing his car seat big snow suits coats made it much tighter , so using this we didn't put them him . fit very good our graco car set , kept baby warm it lot easier just zip this down when you get somewhere rather than take coats off . i stashing this away use if i baby , wish i bought it sooner .	1
this most comfortable carrier i tried , easiest put . shoulder-cupping theory works well practice , least my son who 7.5 kilos right now . carrier itself well made clasps nice instead tie it . i would say mobility tad limited because if you reach anything high up shoulder strap slips up around my neck , but otherwise i able stuff around house while wearing my son , we both comfortable	1
i used this pillow since beginning my pregnancy it wonderful . no problems stuffing becoming lumpy or mis-shapen . great releaving hip pain stomach sleeper , it allows you sleep your side similar comfort stomach sleeping leaning into pillow . i highly recommend it	1

my 4 month old son absolutely loves this . we got it him when he 2 months old this lifesaver us since then . he plays it over hour time which gives me time other stuff around house	1
i love it i love it i love it ! my son three half months old quickly becomes bored needs new stimulus . this playmat just trick , i'm heaven . when he tires staring wide array toys attached playard playing them he rolls over pushes aqua part mat(his favorite part ) then he rolls back over stares lights dancing fish detachable music box happily laughs kicks cloth poles hold soft child safe friendly toys above his head , he loves able control movements toys above his head so much ... cloth covered poles not scare me muc typical plastic ones , lastly he looks himself mirror he drifts off sleep . he loves this mat finally given me some free time . tummy time doubled voluntarily since we recieved it mail . defenitely worth higher price ! also biggest playmat this type i've found market defenitely last me until far after we hit crawling stage then detachable toys still usable . mat naptime . thank you	1

i purchased this stroller few weeks ago . i 22 month old 4 year old they love it ... my 4 year old loves fact if she gets tired she sit or stand back . we going ny couple weeks this why i purchased this stroller because you walk everywhere , now i am sure they ok . reason why i only gave it 4 stars because it little heavier than i expected . other than i great ! i higly recommend it . i plan child so i know i keep this while !	1

grandmother i find this easy quick warm bottles or baby food jars . heats very little time easy adjust temperature adding or removing water . wish i this when my kids little	1
this great product ! i bought 3 additional ones baby showers after i used first one myself . it quick easy . although you guess how much water put warmer , but you get used it pretty quickly . i can't live without it recommend it everyone	1
these place mats greatest , you children want feed their selves but also you can't give them plate their own without them dropping them making mess . mats work great because tables not always clean you would like you just gather up all your mess end meal throw it away	1
i'm mechanical engineer after reading other reviews , i thought i'd pull out my tools make this thing work our peg perego p3 stroller . fact , it went quite easily . key locate clamps just below p3 logo brace goes down toward rear wheels . this allows stroller folded up without removing clamp - even if you large accessories like snack tray or cup holder attached . i slightly angle cup holder out when seat reclined all way back ( because we snap car seat currently our infant ) . i could not attach clamps anywhere else stroller though due large oval tubing necessity folding it up . i'm impressed quality unit though . sure use long bolts since oval-shaped tubing makes it little difficult connect two halves clamp . it would even better if " clickngo " included bolts 1/4 " longer so you wouldn't strain pull halves together .	1
bought this set black our maclaren ryder stroller great success . you need test positions before you tighten clamps make sure they won't interfere closing stroller . we placed one clamp side so our daughter could access either her sippy cup or snack tray depending which we attached time , other clamp one stroller handles so we could attach cup holder or water bottle holder our use . we spent few days disney world no problems attachments falling off or knocking into things . you need remember remove store attachments before folding stroller so they don't get knocked off lost . we haven't used s-hooks yet , they feel look little flimsy , but they'd probably okay light bags	1
this sterilizer wonderful ! first time mother , i'm still figuring out things . but i realized this one those things i truly need . it so easy use save lot time . i am not germ freak , but i like know bottles i am traveling clean sterile . my baby almost 6 months old i used it dr. brown bottles , medela breast pump parts , any other baby parts would fit into it .	1

i love this item . i not any trouble it so far . my infant set fits right . if baby sleeping we go game , i place car seat right cabana	1
i've owned this stroller more than two years used it almost every day , typically strolling two miles per day , often lots groceries storage basket . my toddler also takes her naps graco ( won't nap anywhere else ) . one little piece just broke it not safety issue but i'm taking opportunity shop smaller stroller . reading reviews other strollers , including pricey ones , made me appreciate graco even more . i wish it little more narrow maneuver through tight store aisles , take up less room my house , but i no other complaints . here list pros cons ... pros : - rides very , very well . durable up down curbs . - large storage area accommodates up three bags groceries . - toddler comfortable naps stroller . - reclines easily folds pretty easily . - two cup holders back one front tray which clicks off one side remove child more easily . - window back view child through shade . - adjustable handle good tall people ( i'm 5'10 " push it comfortably ) . - works graco car seat newbornscons : - quite wide . sometimes hard fit through aisles small neighborhood stores takes up lot space home car trunk . - doesn't accommodate newborns without car seat . - shade doesn't fully shield child until he/she quite tall . until one year age , i draped light blanket over shade when necessary .	1
i used this my daughter . only time it leaked when it wasn't snapped right . we never used music ( thinking it wouldn't beneficial she'd want put toys it make music go ) . it lot easier clean our other potty chair . there little ' trick ' ( if you call it ) unsnap it before pulling it out instead just pulling it all way once . lightweight but sturdy . it back which feels more like real potty . she no problems sitting it . obviously , we never used pee guard ( which easily removable )	1
i bought this play gym our daughter when she 5 months old . she loves it , plays it happily long periods time , little musical lion toy actually musical ( not all annoying ! ) plays several different catchy tunes . toys moved around swapped out different , separate toys , more links added move things closer her . we very happy this purchase , so she	1
my son 3 half we started potty training two months before he turned 3 . we purchased cheaper seats target walmart , but he would still #2 accidents . our toilet very elongated all other seats didn't fit well very wobbly . we just recently bought baby bjorn toilet trainer now he excited going #2 .... it very secure because adjusting dial he get potty all himself . no more accidents after week this seat ! high front prevents #1 spillage contor shape holds him well . i wish i known this seat 8 months ago . i very highly reccomend this seat	1

my 6 month old son enjoys this saucer lot . i just wish it more height adjustments - even highest setting 6 months 27 inches tall seems not high enough - my son put his whole foot ground - instructions say babies should only able reach bottom their toes . overall though , great product	1
my son , he picture above , received this christmas gift his aunt , picked out me because it just everything you need toy like this . music sounds not annoying parents , least not me my five month old , jacob loves it . he content there least hour , which gives me sometime get some things . he laughs when frog croaks when bee buzzes he actually hums when music plays . it learning mode raised toy bar or music mode which great younger babies like mine . i highly reccommend this item . even though my son big playmat part i still use mat put floor when he playing	1

i really love this wipes warmer ! my baby used cry when we changed his diaper night but now we use warm wipes he hardly notices it he not fully wake up . i definetly recommend it other friends . only drawback i could not buy it mexico so i ask friend it	1
i can't believe there so much controversy bottle warmers wipe warmers ! if you choose get one , this wipe warmer great ! heating element top , which makes it safer than other models . this also ensures next wipe ( one top ) warmest ... makes sense ! i haven't used night light yet , but i may future . besides , this model doesn't cost any more than one without night light . when we out , obviously my baby gets treated cold wipes , but home we always change her her nursery warm ones . i am glad this " luxury " my baby . i am pleased i avoid cold wipes especially middle night or after particuarly bad bm . it nice able provide little extra comfort . i use pampers sensitive pop-up wipes , sometimes two pop out instead one , but it really no problem ... how many times you use just one wipe anyway ? i've no issue dry wipes because i read directions . i just add water whenever i add wipes ; it no-brainer ! if i'm going out , not using wipes home all day , i unplug warmer -- according directions . i keep my warmer changing pad , i always very warm , moist wipes tend my baby ... just like gentle wash-cloth	1
i received this play gym shower gift prior my childs birth . i also received larger more elaborate play gym same time . because this gym smaller more portable i started placing my munchkin it 3 weeks stimulate entertain her . bold black white designs primary colors perfect newborn attempt focus there aren't ton hanging toys overstimulate or startle her . it folds up easily carrying around house or packing car trip grammie . you even throw few extra toys when folded ( it like large purse or carrying bag ) know they won't fall out way . now baby close 2 months old more playful hanging toys just right height her bat she loves gaze herself coo into mirror . overall i'm pleased gym would reccomend it . i only gave it 4 stars because times overhead bar tilt this way or you straighten it bit keep it upright	1
we discovered my son liked swing when he would fall asleep gym nursery thier swings . i chose this one because we already baby einstein pack-n-play timer feature which works perfectly way . my 9 week old son goes right sleep . simply wonderful	1

when i first bought this my son he around 4-5 months old . i disappointed first because he not like it . he would sceam when i put him it . i thought , wasted money . every week i started put him it more , he finally figured out around 6 months how jump it . now it his favorite activity . he jumps himself silly , loves play all toys . he spends most time trying get parrot top . highly recommend . just give them time adjust big enough use it .	1
we actually buy couple extra bases each our cars sitters too .	1
i loved my diaper genie . i used it 2 years without problem . my teenage daughter even figured it out . it kept smell contained pretty well . we would empty it every 5 days never problem . well worth investment	1
us this life saver !!... it really helpfull ... i even bought one my mother house ... im agree lot nice stuff other reviews im not going repeat them , but i say something how many times it gets full . it not true it gets full everyday .... or .... it would get full if you put diapers open .... what you fold diaper together wipes you use , you would see difference ... i use change it every 2 days , now it gets full every 4 days .... refills not expensive all , you could always get free refills babies us , buying 2 or 3 together .... i use one refill every 3 weeks or so .... i haven't try any other one market , but me this perfect , so i could say best option !!	1

if i could give this product 10 stars , i would . my son loves snuggled up his swaddle me . he sleeps better doesnt startle easily . he hard time staying awake when he it , so if your baby doesnt stay awake feedings , you may want wait until after he full swaddle him . i wish i purchased least 2 . i plan buy one , well 2 large sized ones . so far i tried small microfleece . my son born 7 lbs still using small one ( its rather large him ) 3 weeks later ( not sure how much he weighs now , but 0-3 month sized clothes still too big him ) . future , any woman i ever buy baby gift getting 1 or 2 these me . you cannot baby without one ! make sure you get 2 or 3 because you miserable when your only swaddle me wash , or if you leave it somewhere , like i just :	1

let me start saying i twins 2.5 . i never written review before i wanted so this item . i reluctant purchase cooshie due cost purchased hard plastic ones wal-mart instead . hard plastic ones leaving small bruises my girls ' backs right their spine leaning back into hard seat . they also rub finish off seats your hard wood chairs without putting something under them . also hard plastic ones hard clean difficult remove seats clean under them , because crumbs get under it it around it . cooshie light enough my girls carry it around them selves they love sit them watch tv . i love ease able move seats without unstrapping them case we need extra adult space . mine came carry bags so we take them us restaurant not use germ infested seats there . cooshie seats well worth money . i plan use ours several years come . they also breeze clean	1
i smaller five year old wanted sit big boy chair , not stool we using . after he destroyed one our phone books , scratched our wood chairs hard plastic seat , i found cooshie . i highly recommend it . it easy cart you he loves seat move around . we looking forward using it next week movie theater . no more coats ! consider this seat if your child smaller , but no longer toddler . addition , he loved color softness . what bonus	1
i love carseat , my baby small she so cozy it . this my third child i wish i this carseat first . i not tell you how many compliments i get it when i go out too ! it so pretty	1
i purchased this stroller walking around neighborhood so weight/size/fold not issue . tires suspension give smooth ride it easy steer . negatives : seat padding could thicker , recline mechanism cheap toggle , i laughed when i read others ' complaints getting their finger caught harness but it happened my husband myself . price , it great value i would definitely recommend it	1
this tent much needed item after my son 18m climbed out his crib but then not emotionally ready his daybed yet . since i needed it asap i could not wait shipping so i called local stores . it wasn't few baby stores , which surprised me but i found it babies us . i wanted original one without side enclosures but could not find it . i guess there good reason they changed design i trust it wise consumers input . anyway , setting up tent part snap but affixing it our crib challenge . we convertbable 4 1 crib headboard higher than drop rail side . this means front back vertical poles aren't even which causes problem when trying secure super strong velcro fasteners . it would leave it crooked possibly able slide since corners would not resting stable must . we found way level it , since i not gonna give up . my hubby mounted old broomstck behind backboard even front we got it level , well rested snug crib perimeter . my complaint taking time effort based good safety so i say it preparation not disway your purchasing . velcro hoops so tough pry open then fasten it worked me out . also , when inserting mattress we found it much easier if two people it so they get it flat then drop it into net rather than trying sinch down sides . enclosure soo snug it make it hard adjust if you drop one side down first . all say , my son loves it so eager get back into his crib lastnight . i peace knowing he wont fall trying climb out again	1
we very pleased this item . others mentioned , changing sheets requires removing entire tent , but i didn't mind doing this . our son thought it neat- just like camping inside . he not even attempt jump out his crib after this put . it fit just fine our sleigh crib	1
this perfect chair . we love it . my son 6 months he seems really confortable it . i'm sure he'll fine next few years . it very convenient all its different positions . i feed him living room or kitchen table . he vertical eat solids , little less drink his bottle laying back if he falls asleep . it very easy clean well , easy fold . it just perfect . nothing wrong it .	1
i seriously love this bowl spoon . bowl fits nicely your hand so it easy feed squirming baby . spoon very soft tip so you don't worry hurting their gums . my daughter year old mostly feeds herself , but we still using bowl snacks or i'll put yogurt one side fruit other . lid always stays bowl still looks new even though we've used them lot . i would highly recommend this product	1
my son used this until he refused sit basket anymore . i just washed it every so often kept it my car next time . maks them more comfy keeps them warmer winter	1
this amazing product . i seen other shopping cart covers stores but they all little ties velcro sides look quite complicated . who time all ? floppy seat you just stretch it over cart , slide seat belt through , buckle go . it covers all surfaces cart , unlike some others . it so nice comfy , lots cushion i attach toy loops put my baby sun hat pocket . wonderful , wonderful , wonderful . i know it more expensive than some covers stores but it well worth extra cost . this one best baby products we purchased	1
first time mom i am very nervous my son getting germs . he likes lick everything . i got this product it fit nicely every cart i ecountered except costco cart . cart too big . i still able cover seat handle preventing aj " tasting cart " . i also like fact it easily washable its own safety strap . minor problem i can't seem fold it up without carefully thinking it . otherwise it stays my trunk out way unitl i need it	1
my mom bought this me , thinking it would help my back discomfort . well , i rolled my eyes idea i found relief ! i able up no lower back discomfort . it very discreet i am not constantly walking around holding my back or belly . belly sling , we call it , great i would definitly recomend this product	1
right moment it arrive my daughter loves it . she sleeps perfectly dora stuffed sleep her nightnight time	1
this potty seat fits toilet not slip around . child secure comfortable , rather than doing balancing act . this goes long way child trying his best learn . also , its easy clean .	1
when i registered my baby shower , i inadvertently registered regular ventaire bottles well natural shape bottles ( which what i wanting ) , so my review discuss both types . natural shape ventairefor starters , natural shape bottles good babies who breastfeeding , because milk doesn't flow out when bottle tipped over . baby really suck get it out , it open its mouth wider due size nipple . feeding my son stage 1 nipple took really long time . approximately 40-45 minutes . however , i tried stage 2 nipple when he four months old , milk flowed out pretty easily . so quickly fact he got really mad refused eat because he getting choked . i switched back stage 1 nipples , also began relying heavily regular ventaire bottles . he now 5 months old we switched stage 2 nipples natural shape bottles , he doing well . he tends finish 6-7 oz bottle 10 minutes . these bottles lot wider than regular bottles , he harder time trying grasp hold these bottles . regular ventaire now regular ventaire bottles . i found these bottles better two us . although i initially breastfed , chose natural shape bottles reason , i quit breastfeeding four weeks . so issue nipple wouldn't confuse baby no longer concern us . regular ventaire bottles no flow issues , even stage 1 nipples . he finished his bottle faster this type bottle seemed no problems speed flow . we switched stage 2 nipples couple weeks ago transition smooth . i didn't notice him getting choked , he doesn't gulp quickly he stage 2 nipples natural shape bottles . these bottles also slimmer , which makes it easier him try grasp hold bottle . now operation both types bottles . they plastic disc fits into bottom ring bottle , then bottle screws , finally nipple its ring screw top . regular ventaire bottles disc fits snugly into bottom . natural shape bottles , it fit into little notch , it easy think it right only find out its not ( ie , when milk starts leaking out ) . we heat our bottles pan water stove , bottom rings tendency hold water . so if you use this method , you need tap bottle sideways pan shake out water ring , i usually hold dish towel up edge ring well tip bottle so all hot water comes out . if you don't , when you tip bottle feed your baby hot water run down onto your hand ( or baby hand if s/he hold bottle ) . this isn't really reason not buy bottles , just something aware . finally , some people wondered if babies swallow less air this type bottle . i two older children i used standard bottles , i seen no difference those these playtex bottles . my son still burps just much next baby . occasionally during feeding you hear some air leaking out , but overall , i really don't think it makes any difference	1
this good quality gate which not too difficult install . we use it 2 cats , so we don't lock unlock gate pass through it , since cats can't push gate open . i liked pressure gauge included unit . very sturdy , very solid . it well worth cost	1
five young children our home , we two these baby bjorn potties . constant use ( abuse ) they still look brand new ! they easy clean ( i even stuck bowl portion dishwasher ) easy transport . my kids love bright colors which make potty training easier :) well worth money !	1
we bought 2 these potty chairs . they so easy clean stayed brand new looking i sold both them 75% their original list price when we them . how cool ? they maintained their value . note : when potty training , don't forget buy character underwear . we bought elmo underwear baseball cap ( sport theme ) ebay it worked great . trained within days !!	1
this one best covers market great price ! you use these flat or prefolds without using pins or fasteners or it works fitted diaper	1
i purchased this baby registry gift out state friend . they keep raving how great it .	1
i using this changing pad two years it works great . only problem it rip . i am buying new one my next child but this time i buy changing pad cover go over it	1
ok just so you guys know , student child development safety , your child not suffocate due use bumper pads . only reason this happened because parents not securely positioned their sleeping child child rolls over , buries his or her face bumper , suffocates . you should , however , remove bumpers once your child able pull him or her self standing position crib , since bumper used step climb up fall out . i hope this puts some your minds ease .	1
safety reasons i reluctant purchase bumper . after looking this one person seeing it ties top bottom i decided purchase it . my daughter fine without it but i like color it brought crib . i wanted her able see cute animal design so i pattern facing toward her . her crib drop down side so i bumper pad running across back ends crib . i took excess pad wrapped it back around outside each crib end tied it . none solid blue shows . i am very pleased quality this bumper pad highly recommend it	1
this light umbrella stroller but performs like big bulky one . i able use it my grandson grows . i would recommend this my friends	1
we purchased this car seat our daughter when she turned one 20 lbs . we loved our peg perego infant seat but she clearly outgrowing it uncomfortable . so far she loves this seat i love safety profile color . she enjoys riding this seat it plenty room fits her size well . only 2 flaws i find i personally dislike 1 . you not hear distict " click " when you buckle 5 point harness . me this juat reassurance it locked . 2 . i dislike rubber strap covers may consider cutting them off . they make straps harder maneuver . i like velcro attachments side allow you pull straps apart when you put baby . this real time effort saver . overall we really love seat . we also purchased graco comfort sport car seat our secondary car it good seat overall but not nice britax . plus britax goes 65 lbs graco only 40 . britax definitely worth money better seat primary car	1
what great seat !!! excellent growth long term . i especially like sides seat offer great side impact protection . also five point harness accomodates child up 65lbs 49 " length . 5-point harness super easy use adjust . seat installation breeze latch system included . i bought my seat online travelingtikes.com who prices far lower than any other advertised price more than fifty dollars shipping included ..... right ! i purchsed tan seat " portland " best matched our car interior . im so happy britax rated so well their seat such household name which made my purchase much easier research . my little guy styling !!!	1
easy diner so nice take you anywhere . it sometimes little hard fold up or i would given it 5 stars . i just hope it lasts while .	1
if you baby , you've gotta regalo portable high chair . it most convenient item i've seen since strollers . it very high quality design materials . directions breeze . it washes easily , travels easily , looks nice just perfect item if you granny live small apartment but want grandbaby eat you often . parents love it too because they take it restaurants avoid using " contaminated " restaurant chairs . it perfect so many reasons . get one today . you'll glad you	1
when my daughter born , i didn't know swaddling , it would take me hours get her sleep ! i would feed or rock her my arms until she falls asleep , then put her her crib ... she'd flail her arms , wake up cry , i start all over ! what nightmare ! then i figured out since her arms wake her , it would make sense wrap her something so she couldn't move them much ... so i started wrapping her regular receiving blankets . it worked ! it became much easier get her sleep . but then she wiggled out those receiving blankets wake up again . when she little over month old , somehow i came across swaddleme blankets internet immediately bought it . it worked great ! it so easy wrap my daughter it , it stayed put . my daughter started sleeping so much better ! i wish i found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me so many sleepless nights ! 2 years later , my son born , thankfully i already knew those blankets start . he goes sleep great swaddleme blanket ! out curiosity , i tried put him sleep without this blanket , his arms wake him right away - exactly same my daughter ! i consider this blanket one most important baby items you could buy . it should must new mother who wants get some sleep	1
if you want your baby near you night , co-sleeper great . it makes getting out bed bit challenge , but it nice able look over see my infant daughter sleeping , or comfort her back sleep little rocking my hand if she not ready get up . very easy set up sturdy . my only complaint sheet- it shrinks lot wash , gets tangled up because velcro , not easy change quickly . also , replacement sheets expensive (@$15 ) . instead , i recommend using bassinet sheet- they exactly right size , softer , around $5	1
just received bag . material seems very strong . reviewer site mentioned only thing missing cushioned shoulder strap , so what i plan use removable velcro cushions came my daughter infant carseat put them straps so my shoulders won't hurt . haven't used it yet but plan take it plane real soon , i'm just happy booster seat so awesome it folds . update : didn't need cushions because it pretty light anyway . carseat fits well , it protects seat well when you check it airport .	1
really cute , very portable " plush " sports bag . various balls ... best part it not electronic !! each ball makes some sort jingle or crinkle or " boing " sound ... but they're great baby just handle or chew	1
we purchased this stroller take wdw . we pleased this stroller . we able easily collapse get off buses , it very easy manuever . despite it light weight , i able put three four jackets one bag back it without it turning over -- even without my three yr old stroller ! ( it tip over once or twice , it just took lot more than i expected it would tip . ) i didn't problems handles too short ( i'm 5'7 " ) , but my husband ( 6'3 " ) . but overall , only way it could better would one little cup holder . i've three different umbrella strollers this far best one i've owned . it ability maneuver through crowds turn quickly simply excellent ! price , i would not / could not purchased better umbrella stroller	1
very cute way cleverly protect your child keep them close . we two year old going amusement park his other sibilings , him hold your hand ( yeah , right -- not all time ) . he likes independent loves dogs backpacks so he feels like older kids . this helps , doesn't look like you your kid leash	1
it take lot get this lock open , but it literally only thing worked my house more than 24 hours . everything else too easy pull off .	1
i don't any stroller age kids , but avoid further loss coffee mugs off top my car i started looking cup holder i could attach my yakima roof rack . lionheart model i used year or more required extensive modification , it wouldn't hold insulated cups unless handle open bottom , but it once carried coffee mug safely bellevue seattle ! after it broke i found valco , which attached easily might even fit square thule cross bar . it seems lot tuffer , some closed handle mugs fit . best thing i'll talk parking lot ski areas	1
i really used this sunshade this summer . if fits really well both single stroller jog stroller i own . it comes off easily doesn't interfer anything . it provided both sun protection wind protection ( when pulled all way down ) so i ended up using it cooler days also . spf also bonus you don't realize how much sun directed little one even regular shade	1
i absolutely love this storage system ! after showing it one my girlfriends , she replaced everything she used baby #1 playtex used playtex system baby #2 . it very clean simple system minimizes risk contamination since you not transfer milk one storage device . it worked perfectly my medela pump style ; you use same bag pumping , storing feeding . i deep-freeze chest freezer used this storage . i followed manufacturer suggestion double bag freezing . i never any problems . if you want see how much your baby eating , clean hands , simply lift bag out ring drop it directly into bottle shell ( ring heavy-duty enough it lifts out easily ) . remember , when you breastfeeding baby directly breast , you don't see how much baby getting . dr. sears says , " baby who getting sufficient volume milk usually least 6-8 wet cloth diapers ( 4-6 disposable diapers ) per day after initial three days start-up time . enough wet diapers tell you your baby safe dehydration . " everyone different preferences , but i honestly can't see how anyone could dissapointed this storage kit . i only purchased two kits because most time , i fed directly breast , eventually , dd wouldn't take bottle , but moms who plan return work , i would recommend more kits . i really only used my kits beginning when i pumping lot because i so much milk	1
i really like this booster seat . cushioning soft comfortable my son . i also like head rest . some reviews i read talked how head rest acted like blinders their children . my son doesn't mind them all they keep his head stable when he sleeps which i love	1
i bought this my 4 year old daugher . i liked safety review this seat . my daughter loves everything it . i don't one bad thing say this seat . i've it 3 months it looks like it when i pulled it box . she spilled everything you could think it you can't tell . it even still smells new ! cushion just good first day she used it . i buy my 18 month old daughter when she big enough	1
i purchased this crib because its price colour . i nervous buying without seeing model one first . my husband put it together couple hours no major drama . my daughter used it since she 6 weeks old , she now 14 months . i love it , it sturdy beautiful , drawer underneath valuable storage ( we nyc ) , it easy me lower my daughter grew . i think it practical it converted into bed	1
my son born premature . i breastfed long i could but after he diagnosed severe acid reflux . i needed find bottle . he needed cereal every bottle thicken it , medications pain help move it his digestive track . first i tried playtex bottles disposable liners . amount gas spit up still quite lot i still unhappy baby . then my doctor told me dr. brown bottles . they bit more expensive then others but worth every dime !!!! clean up fine too if you just throw all pieces together nipple basket dishwasher . i never use bottle my future children ever again . i am so happy i found these . my son like different baby first time he used these bottles . gas gone , spit-up decreased well over half previous amount . i tell every mother soon-to-be mother i run into dr. brown bottles . i'll never buy brand	1
i initially tried avent wide-neck bottles my newborn didn't like them . those bottles leaked , nipples gave my son suction blisters his lips , he needed extensive burping , i didn't find graduations bottles correlate any other measures home my son seemed hard time getting hang how suck against negative-pressure builds up avent bottles . dr browns bottles solved all these issues . i am extremely happy them . you need get used washing small parts but once you routine going it well worth effort . it takes me under 20 minutes wash six bottles ( i prefer not use dishwasher ) . small brush which comes starter kit multi-pack varieties essential cleaning lasts 6-8 weeks regular use . i recommend going straight 8oz bottles buy 9-pack which available other websites . when warming these bottles , if you find fluid going up into vent , just loosen collar , column liquid goes back down tighten again . if breastmilk stored these bottles fridge , fat content tend stick plastic vent . you receive level-1 nipples starter kit/multi-packs , however you may want graduate level-2 3-months age , level-2 6-months age y-cut nipples any thick liquids ( e.g milk cereal ) . caps snap loudly which only ' con ' i think . use travel disc avoid leakage when transporting milk . my friend babies refulx well these bottles . my son doesn't reflux but i can't imagine using any other bottle him . highly recommend them would definitely buy agai	1
children seriously injured or killed televisions falling them . this product great idea , long it secured stand or shelf can't move . this one definitely worth $ keep your child(ren ) safe	1
we received this monitor off our registry . long time we never used sensor pad . we felt we didnt need it . few weeks ago our daughter started rolling onto her stomach middle night unbeknownst us . we would turn her only find her moments later , or even hours later , her stomach . we finally let her sleep her tummy becuase it obvious where she wanted . so pressure pad so sensitive it picks up 3 month old breathing . we only few false alarms but becuase she way over corner crib . hope helps	1
this great help our infant daughter . she sleepsacks since practically birth . she stays warm snug can't kick it off . we only use it night , so when it goes , she knows it bed time . it part routine now . highly recommended	1
i bought this sleepsack my 4 month old daughter she totally loves it . she sleeps all night now , where before she'd wake up like 5 am . she gets cold easily so i still put light blanket over her even though she sleepsack , plus it gives her added security , me some peace mind knowing she not buried under pile blankets . but i got mine marshalls $13.00 , sure beats paying almost $20.00	1
avent nipples wonderful my baby . i not experience nipple confusion when i started my son bottles i am still breastfeeding . i am very happy there products would recommend them everyone	1
we bought this our son last year christmas when he 3 1/2 months old . he liked it but we stuff blankets help him sit up . we bought this over exersaucer because we not room store anything large . he really liked it . he now 15 months old walking but still likes jump it . i put him there when i am cleaning he great time	1
i pretty petuina pickle bottom bag , baby bjorn diaper bag , baby sherpa bag i say none them functioned me . other moms i am sure those bags worked great them but this tiny compact bag greatest . i wish i this bag when my son first born . although it looks small it holds everything ! it gives you chance your hands free without even feeling like you wearing bag . i am love this bag . it so nice go out not feel like i am moving . my other bags they so big bulky this one it like i don't even it . again it must all moms !!!! if you get black gray it great dad well .	1
love this bag so my girlfriend who wanted steal mine first . it fits most essentials go out day mall or run errands . it even fits my wideneck bottles wallet . there not enough room change clothes , changing pad , or toys but that what bottom stroller . it very comfortable wear even over jacket not hurt your back carry it . it never way maneuvering your way through aisles .	1

i am extremely happy this product . i am disappointed line disappearing off internet fast though ... when i first ordered this there diaper keeper which i planned getting if i liked pattern , but it isn't available now :( i highly recommend this blanket entire collection	1
we bought this carrier after owning older one started look quite ugly . i must say , this company thought everything ! there place my cell phone right shoulder straps padding parent shoulder back area superb . i never thought i would use canopy this type product but i it great feature keep your little one dry . great job chicc	1
we love these bibs . they wash up easily fold up really small easy packing . they're soft , light , totally water proof	1
when my baby newborn , i felt i didn't enough control safely carry her this sling . it just seemed uncomfortable her head - it not like picture ( very thin !? ) woman newborn - they must proped baby head up take picture . i felt like she getting lost folds . however , now she 6 months i wear her my hip . new native sling awesome - it simple , material very nice soft , i take it off easily most important - she totally comfy , secure entertained , watching my every move !	1
this pretty good chair . over all i'm happy it , though i not like handle , my daughter now 16pounds it isnt easy carry her it . but most part , she likes seat its pretty pink , it fits well car i'm 99% satisfie	1
i think this item very good . only problem we steps could just bit longer fit our toilet better . when he goes set down steps come up off floor it gets bit wobbly . but he really likes idea climbing " ladder " using potty ( big toilet ) himself . potty training must one most challenging things teach child , every little thing make it bit easier great ! only thing steps they really need take off their pants/shorts before stepping up . they not step up get turned around them pulled down , steps not secure enough pull down their pants once they up there , least my son not yet without feeling like he fall . but , if it gets him more willing use potty this item doing its job imo	1
played non-electronic version , this upgrade help game play move more smoothly . there few drawbacks however . it easy accidently reset game pressing wrong button , since teams designated #1 #2 controller controller travels around room , it easy get confused give points other team mistake . this happens lot , especially if you're playing group who not played recently or not familiar game . fact there no multiple parts big plus . this very good group word game once everyone gets into groove	1
we recently used this my 26 month old son his britax marathon . it so simple . my husband help , we able attach it carry-on while my son remained sleeping his seat . my son real busy body hates strollers , so i worried he would not want sit it during our layover after stuck plane 4 hours , but he loved it . he actually couldn't wait sit it wheeled through airport . once we got our final destination , he actually threw fit because we would not take seat out car wheel him inside house	1
i traveled this summer my 18 month old . i planned take our car seat since we renting car when we landed . i layover each way , so i looking way move him through airport little fuss since airlines strict stroller policies . so , i found traveling toddler thought i would try it . it awesome so affordable ! it easy use , even when i unhook it security when boarding plane . my toddler ( who nearly 30lbs time ) loved riding through airport loved security sitting his car seat . make sure your luggage locking extension handle so you push or pull your toddler . great product ! i recommended it many .	1
awesome product , well worth money . only car seat i ever buy again !! comfortable , attractive withstands wear tear kids	1
after debating spending $$ this seat , i purchased this 2 others try our small suv . ( we land rover freelander . ) others bulky harder install . this far best 3 i bought . ( i returned other 2 ! ) not only it comfortable my baby , who so far used it 3 months 9 months old it still looks brand new ... but it also easy me put her . straps don't twist i love velcro holds straps side i put in/take her out . this model also rated highest consumer reports crash tests !! my daughter use this one til we baby needs it , then i buy big girl britax seat her	1
we extremely happy this carseat . we saw no need infant/detachable since we use sling carry our baby . one note though : if you plan using this seat newborn , make sure your purchase separate head support . our baby small , awhile even double headsupport wasn't enough keep her head falling forward . we just tucked folded blanket under her chin help give her support . one major bonus , she very comfortable this seat . when she went through her fussy , oops i mean high need ;) period , just sitting her this seat ( not even driving anywhere ) calmed her instantly ! we love fact this only carseat we'll need buy . when you take into consideration , not buy infant then carseat later , price not bad all . britax = quality safety	1
i bought this product arrival my second child . i bottle fed my first child well . this product timesaver/lifesaver ! i only wish i it 4 years ago my first child . key read directions carefully before using this product . if you use more than recommended measurement water warmer you scald bottle formula it won't cool down easily either . long you read instructions follow them , this product wonder joy use . cooler especially nice because it cuts down nighttime feeding process , but you must take special care not chill bottles longer than recommended 8 hrs . you'll love convenience peace mind ! if i only knew then what i know now ... :	1

we used this gate separate large room into two sections keep little ones out big kids ' activities . price it really worth it us . basically now we two rooms instead one , minus scary paranoia babies may choke small part toys . we've it 6 months , it still perfectly intact looks superb . since we apo ( overseas us address ) shipping always very tricky . usually companies charge huge rates ship it slow boat making tremendous profits alone shipment . this company , pegasus shop/safe baby shop exactly opposite : small shipping cost ultra fast shipment . we got it just few days our surprise . since then i deal business other inquiries they wonderfully honest helpful . 100% satisfied	1
i've this pump 5 months i use it before i go work morning , twice work , once when i get home . i little concerned first because such expensive pump motor only 90 day warranty . i plan keep my daughter breastmilk until she least one wanted pump would last . i tried one avent manual pumps , but i engorged before i would get few ounces out one side ( nothing out other ) . medela pump so much easier all work you . pump held up so far i'm really happy it . i bought extra shields bottles pack me take work , keep rest home . only downside i saw these bottles they made fit only medela products . otherwise , pump great i'd recommend it anyone looking something durable easy use	1
would recommend ..... clean great , work well long they screwed together properly	1
i tried many bottles my daughter . she originally used nurser bottles supplementation while i breastfeeding(low supply ) . they told me pump so i got cheap regular 4 oz baby bottles pump into so she could drink directly out . she started all kinds stomach upset . we then tried dr. browns bottles . they good but she trouble nipple . we switched wide neck dr. brown bottles , which she better , but still didn't like nipple . finally i got back out playtex nursers . upset stomach problem got better . she still reflux , i think always , but gas only occasional now . don't waste your time or money other bottles . easier clean too . you can't microwave these liners , but what i mix up days worth formula pitcher i keep fridge pour into liner just before ready feed , i then put liner formula glass hot tap water . it only takes minute or two warm up . then drop liner bottle you're ready feed . my favorite nurser bottles ez feed slider get air out . they sometimes hard find but really easy use . one comes newborn set or you purchase them individually babiesrus or publix grocery store . if there more than 5 stars these bottles would get higher rating . can't say enough good things them . also easy travel	1
i hate wash bottles every night these great time saver ! just throw out liner you only wash nipples . baby just loves them so hubby he like wash bottles either he likes how once you push air out baby feed any position long there suction . i don't premix because you can't put them microwave but we bottle warmer so it works just well . put powder bottle first before water or it won't mix wel	1
i live northern ga when i got pregnant i lived southern la , never thinking i would need something heavier than blanket my infant son . after first morning scraping frost off front my car my 4 month old son waiting patiently inside house car warm up , i realized i wrong . i graco windsor snugride travel system , so i ordered celadon bundle me , thinking two greens would match . it not perfect match , so i probably should ordered graphite instead , but far product goes , my son loves it . i even unzip top cover use it mat when we play friends ' houses or when we visit family top cover his pack play . my son likes snuggle down into bundle me i like i just unzip part it while we're driving if he starts get hot . i definitely suggest this anyone who lives somewhat chilly area . i probably invest lite version once spring arrives ; anything so my son doesn't get bulked up sweater or jacket just comfortable weather	1
i bought this toilet when my son less than 2 when i tired all typical childrens toilets . potty perfect because how portable it , my son could it near all times . biggest problem how small potty , even my son it somewhat tiny . he outgrew it very within 6 months but i feel $10 it well worth it . it served purpose i needed time	1
i thought monitor worked really well . i picked this one out because i loved glow light feature . it so much better use low light during nighttime feedings .... but light bulb receiver not replaceable :( i only used it 6months it burned out me already . it goes off after 15 minutes directions say it long lasting . well , not long enough i am contacting comopany warranty . hopefully they fix it	1
muy buena adquisici�n . el beb� se siente c�modo confortable	1
i searched all over every store what seemed like world just find sleeping wedge my 3-month old preemie son . he very bad acid-reflux sleep apnea ( he forgets breathe when he sleeping ) so he absolutely one . i bought this him he sleeping trouble-free ever since . height may only 2-3 " but it works really well , because any taller than ( i actually bought one try under first one ) his poor little head fall over he can't breathe . we him cradle thank god i found one fits it	1
i baby trend sit stand one step ahead which basically same this stroller . it rubber wheels cup holder few other changes . i like this stroller but i am not thrilled quality . wheels don't look all sturdy stroller some play you turn corners . since this our third double stroller ( 2 used ones before ) i think this way double strollers so they don't weigh ton or cost fortune . price , this definetly best double stroller out there . i love hinged front tray so you easily get toddler out . my [ ... ] son loves sit stand options it collapses very easily . putting back seat taking it off takes little time but not too difficult . second sunshade also great option during summer . this stroller going especially wonderful zoo mall .	1
i keep this stocked diapers wipes back my car , so when i go out my daughter short trips i don't need worry bringing diaper bag . it also great bring mall , etc . attach stroller	1
my son now 6 1/2 months old he loves it . he kicks away it until he tires himself out . it bit heavy you must make sure you tie it tight so it doesn't fall or get pulled off . sound 2 settings , low high . i read review said it very low , i suspect it might low setting . overall , i'd like see better way secure it crib but my son loves it	1
works great i use it often see things not wake up baby . item very dark orange when lit almost red . ( i might try yellow one next time . i hope it little lighter .	1
we love these wall hangings ! they come different textures , just like zanzibar bedding set . ours came loops hanging , so we haven't problems others seem .	1
i tried many other brands pads so many them leaked barely held any milk . i've also dealt fuzz sticking my nipples one brand . i tried medium heavy these they worked great . i wear them all night , or all day work , no leaks . i used ultra thin ones when i leaking little they worked fine , although i'm sure they wouldn't work if they very long . they visible through clothes , but i haven't found any aren't . i read reviews so many who don't like them , but me , they best i've found .	1
i loved this drying rack baby bottles nipples . i don't soggy dishcloth my counter anymore it really kind cute	1
this great product big trips or small . traveling alone toddler plane not easy luggage , stroller car seat . this product makes it easier . you option roll it behind you or carry it your back freeing up your hands push stroller . it may take little practice get car seat first but once you've it it easier every time . it also holds up airport luggage handling coming out few scrapes but intact ready roll . i also love it double duty sun shade car seat keeping it cool your little one . i highly recommend it .	1
my daughter actually picked this one out , she really wanted pink . other than cupholders convenient her " treasure " sippy cups . other cups we careful fear they spill out . overall it functions very well very easy change cars	1
i this mattress 3 years now . my daughter started using it newborn still using it her toddler bed age 3 . i no tears or springs popping described review . i guess you could buy 200 dollar mattress your kid , but it really matter ? you noticed how little kids sleep anything ? kids sleep car their neck bent 90 degrees side 3 hours just fine . they also fall asleep floor without complaining . this mattress soft fits cribs nicely . what else you need ? mine held up just fine . all all it good crib matress i would probably buy it again . if you like wasting money , you should buy pillowtop mattress 12,000 springs your kid . otherwise , just save money buy basic one like this .	1
this stroller completely serves its purpose . my little girl almost 3 31lbs , i think this one perfect little one who still needs place when your out , we tried umbrella strollers ( too small ) searched too long perfect one , then i found it here amazon best price ( i look everywhere ) , i read complaints handles low it made it uncomfortable push , well not me , i am 5'6 it just fine me my husband 5'8 we no problems . only drawback storage under it , but it such small price pay , you still put stuff there but not much full size stroller . i would recommend this stroller anyone i could who need transitional one , size all	1
it very good toddlers starting learn hold spoon , size handle great	1
i love these covers . bought several 18 months ago when my son born just recently purchased some other colors when my daughter born . they last through multiple washing , don't fade , or shrink . they some strings start unravel , but it no different than terry towel . tried other covers , this one much stronger significantly deeper side pockets . colors great too . definately recommend	1

this excellent stroller well worth money . my husband i purchased red one buybuybaby . we intended purchasing similar chicco one � price . however , after test driving them ( other brands ) store , maclaren won hands down . handles higher ( good tall people ); it sturdier than most other umbrella strollers ; it steers well ; canopy actually works shade child both sun rain . i would recommend purchasing organizer allows you carry water other bottles you . it worth extra $20 or so . when we fold up stroller , we just flip organizer over front	1
i absolutely love this stoller . i bought it because i am tall my cheapo $20 umbrella stroller causing back pain i kept kicking wheels while pushing . this stroller so much more comfortable push . fabric breathes easily my daughter doesn't complain when she get strapped . only drawback there no cupholder . i tried get generic one attach , but then folder wouldn't fold up . arg . all all , totally worth investment	1
these huge help getting started my first baby . i bought them whim boy glad . they help get my milk started because they apply light pressure which also helps extent nipple . they keep things ( such bra ) rubbing against very very sore nipples . great feature air vents top cups . they there get air nipple , ( you don't want them getting dried out , just makes pain feeding much worse ) . determined breastfeeding mom these fantastic until your milk supply comes steady pace . they not look flattering under tight fitting shirt ( loose always best anyways ) but what when you breastfeeding first few months things adjusting . i felt they looked better two huge wet spots leakage	1

i just received this stroller yesterday . i am 9 months pregnant i able bring it inside put it together myself less than 15 minutes . i notice right break crushed shipping . i called graco this morning they sending me new one free , no questions asked . stroller bit longer than it portrayed picture , but it still smaller than duo glider , it handles wonderfully . it definately something i would not mind taking mall ! i love how rear basket dropped down , not able access it baby seat peave mine my quattro tour single . it little tough get baby seat out because there not lot space , but it nice it so compact . i am sure i get better practice . if you looking double stroller , this one buy !	1
i owned quattro tour single stroller , so excited when duo version came out . i ordered it without ever seeing it , it definitely lived up my high expectations . simply stated , this heavy duty deluxe version duo glider - worth extra money if you afford i t.t he seats large enough growing children - i one yr old two yr old , i foresee they both fit stroller couple years . i " test drove " all other double strollers babies us baby depot , they all seem low seat backs , which won't give any head support if child falls asleep . stroller itself heavy , so if you lug it around or upstairs , keep this mind . i keep mine back my truck , so just getting it out no big deal . i read other reports stating it hard steer , i no problems steering all . one thing i say , if you tall person , this stroller awesome because it higher handle grips . i am 5'9 " , my husband 6'4 " we both use it ease . underseat basket large , there additional " cubby " under front seat great extra storage . parent cupholders child trays/cups designed well . fabric high quality . only minor thing i am annoyed low quality seat restraints ( " seat belts " ) . my single quattro tour duoglider both high quality padded seat belts much better buckles . this one very low quality nylon straps marginally acceptable buckles . ( i also received my box very poor shape - open crushed one side . i only noticed scratches stroller , so didn't feel it worth going through return process cosmetic issues . what up shipping ??? ) *** ultimately *** after hours " test drives " quite bit research , i would recommend this over all other equal higher dollar strollers . it overall very high quality , those worried style , it very sharp looking stroller person	1
i absolutely love these bottles . i used them all 3 my children great success my oldest almost 15 . gas never problem my babies hardly ever spit up . everyone always commented how nice my babies always smelled because they never sour smell babies spit up so much . i worked numerous daycare centers any time parent problems gassy baby spit up all time i always recommend platex nursers them . 9 x out 10 their problems drastically reduced thanks playtex . i am now pregnant my 4th baby though i plan breastfeed much i if i need back up bottle or nursing doesn't work some reason then playtex my bottle choice . all new bottles out there market playtex still my number 1 bottle choice . if there would any drawback all it would cost liners . but i often got lucky would find some yardsales or sale would stock up . also some store brands carry liners just good . i few plastic bottles around just case running out but my babies didn't like them nearly much i could always tell difference their happiness because they would get gassy again . buy playtex nursers . they well worth money	1
gate wonderful -- once you get it right . instructions don't give you clear enough directions i ended up putting latching piece upside down first time . pictures pretty useless , but once you figure out right way install it goes snap . make it more stable you keep gate locked swing only one direction which makes it extra stable against kids puching it . we move our once our kitchen remodel it came down simple went up new door way really easy . latch itself ours pushed down it not latch into place itself now but it very solid gate . over 2 years old it held up great . latch handle can't opened anyone small hands you squeeze both sides so anyone kids under 2-3 who open it installed it wrong . make sure latch hooked wall properly .	1
this swaddler must anyone who newborn , i two these we use them every time he sleeps , both night during naps . they so much easier then regular swaddlers he squirms out , or just come undone , arent big enough ect .	1
i received this bassinet gift while pregnant my second child , after telling my mother second time around i wanted better bassinet side comes down access baby easily ( one i used my first cheap hand-me-down bassinet , which fine , except i couldn't see baby or pick her up without basically get up out bed ) . this great find ! my son almost 5 months old now , he doesn't want leave this bassinet ( but it definitely time , he big his age really outgrowing it ) . things i am happy : * i am able see him without hardly lift my head all , pick him up without strain or get out bed ... wonderful ! * this mini co-sleeper , small unobtrusive . fits nicely next my side our bed , not whole lot extra room space . easy tote around when traveling well , once broken down quite compact . * folds up very easily , similar pack-n-play but even easier i think , once you know how it ( take mattress out , press buttons rails fold ) . * great little place store extra blankets , instructions , carrying case , etc , below , zipped-up compartmen t.t hings note : * mattress bit hard ( basically like pack-n-play mattress , board topped some padding polyester or whatever material cover ) , so i top it sheet it came , blanket i tuck tightly under sides . * mattress not sit flush side rails . lowered side rail sits same level your bed , baby mattress bit lower than ... so bassinet not exactly extension your bed , you cannot just reach across scoot baby you ( i thought it would like , but it isn't ) ... but actually i like this bit better after all . * they sell leg extensions raise bassinet height your bed if need . we needed extensions , after putting them lower side rail same level our bed . extensions made bassinet bit wobbly , which worried me some , but turns out it just fine , even my 2-year-old bouncing around it ! * our little one end up his head against side few occasions , but like someone else wrote , one side mesh , he just fine . you kind make sure mattress lies level its spot , kind hard explain without visual aid , but basically board mattress creates level surface , underneath it just mesh screen velcro connect sheet ( which also velcro ) right place . hopes this helps your decision-making !	1
when i saw this toy amazon , i kid you not , i jumped up down . this one most beloved all toys we bought our nephew , he lost cars over years . so i may buy it again just get them back him ... he loves it so much when i called other day , he playing empty garage . garage doors get off track momentarily , but it easy fix . if you teach child -- adults who play him -- put cars back their garages each time , it becomes marvelously portable toy which play hours . we gave it him around 21 months now almost five , he still likes it . it especially gratifying see such love no-tech toy kid who constantly receives toys light up , beep , other 21st-century tricks . here simple toys brings hours fun years years	1

i received pump style shower gift my first child over 3 years ago ( 2003 ) . due medical problems early i exclusivly pump child #1 . pump worked great . i used it several times day it very effective comfortable . i used it 3 months straight after she born . i stopped using it not because it wore out , but because pumping several times day months so much work i couldn't keep doing it . my determination ran out before pump ! after i packed it up planned using it again if i child . child #2 born early december 2007 i very pleased find my medela pump still excellent working order . child #2 professional breastfeeder day 1 so i only used pump when trying boost my supply or relieve pressure engorgment when baby wasn't hungry . i'd say i used it few times week first 2 months . after 2 months i go back work my pump style came me . i've working few weeks now i use pump twice day . it works good today it 3 years ago . quality not gone down one bit . i plan feeding child #2 exclusivly breastmilk long possible i'm confident my breastpump allow me so . if you plan going back work pumping , or if you plan multiple children then this great pump job . it lasts . its expensive , but better spend money upfront , get pump works great , effective , comfortable , last you through years than throw money away cheaper model you'll end up replacing . pump so great i'm willing bet it'll last right through child #2 if we decided child , it ready go again few more years .	1
i absolutely love this pump . it fast effective i get way more milk this pump than i any other i tried . also -- these things expensive so shop around so you don't overpay . i got mine private practice lc add little love.com got not only pump great price , but owner helped me issues i . bottom line - pump great but only if you someone help support you too	1
we bought this product back 2005 used it during international trip through several airports . it worked advertised all jumbo jets , elicited generally positive reactions other passengers flight crew ; however it could not pass through aisles embraer commuter plane we take short leg our journey . order secure it correctly airline seat , you may get seatbelt extender flight attendant . this car seat/stroller great if you travelling small kids ; they sleep comfortably it makes more efficient transfer gates . i share observation others made regarding its inability take bumps ... reason it not good choice beyond travel maybe use within shopping mall . car seat it ok , it just takes some getting used . we never used it rear-facing configuration , so i cannot rebut comments made other users regards their problems mode .	1
stroller little flimsy everyday use , whole thing kinda heavy ( especially baby it ) . it not hard transfer stroller car seat back , but you need little upper body strength if baby still it . i use it our regular carseat , but not our regular stroller . we only use stroller option airports . using it flying , i wouldn't without it . it faa approved , fits all airplane seats i've tried ( coach ) , it goes easily through security checks . it worth cost just this . i really like this product if you frequent flyer ; however , it kind money-waster if you don't	1

i originally purchased avent isis use dd because i sure i would feel like cow milk line if i used electric pump , i read great reviews isis . after first two months though , i decided isis rather uncomfortable use , massaging breast shield kept losing suction leaking milk out back , so i started researching pumps again . i knew i wanted medela , but some their pumps weigh 8 pounds , i knew i didn't want anything needed use complimentary " stylish backpack " . when i found swing , read reviews , i knew it what i wanted . it nearly compact hand pumps , but uses same two stage action more expensive medela pumps . it comfortable use , i've no problems leaking , it seems more efficient general i just really like this pump . you use double batteries power it , which great if you traveling ( airport ? camping ? ) best part though , came five minute ago when i realized threads swing match threads skinny airvent bottles only ones we get dd use !! no more random bottles , no more pumping one container then pouring into container use	1
i'm so happy i splurged bought this . i using manual pump , getting sore wrists it took forever . swing , though little pricier , totally worth it ! two-phase part really works well . i pretty dubious first , but it great help me i return par t-t ime work .	1
.... i would never bought second electric ! all other moms i know said get medela pump style , but i thought if i could just * maybe * get pump took up 1/4 " space made no noise $50 , i'd try it . i'm not all interested trying pump . i love two , so i keep one work one home , or weekends , when traveling , i use one then use other , both clean . i like avent bottles nipples too . it took series complicated training sessions show my husband how properly assemble use playtex ventaire bottles , but avent bottles require nipple , that it ! so easy	1

i trained my son using this method when he 2 years , 2 months . ( my mom used similar method me 1977 recommended it ) it worked really really well ! he took bit longer learn go poopoo first , until i realized he thought he " making messies " if he went toilet . i solved this taking him around house showing him dishes go cupboard , clothes closet , toys toy box poopoo toilet . he totally got it after . he only couple accidents i recall . i reminded him go pee pee quite lot first , which i believed helped . i stopped all liquid drinking hour hour 1/2 before bedtime him pee right before bed right after getting up . i would highly recommend this prodect everyone who ready potty train . :	1

i just bought this changing pad cover my baby who expected this summer , one things i little concerned if it would fit my existing changing pad my son used . we simmons contoured changing pad , which seems popular pad people use , i happy find it fits very nicely . fabric seem little thin , but i not know how well it hold up , however , until baby comes . pottery barn kids also sells really soft chamois covers variety colors $19 piece , i one those my new baby , too . pottery barn one bit thicker . once i test them both out i'll sure update this post let you know what i think	1

we very large opening our kitchen living room , this only barricade gate we could find . we went ahead bought it , it fairly easy install . pros : 1 ) you angle it so it custom fits your space . you also make it longer or shorter without buy extensions . 2 ) it gate , so you don't continuously step over it or take it down . 3 ) its soft mesh material means fewer bumps head our little one . 4 ) gate slowly closes after you walk through it ( but it doesn't latch shut , fyi ) . cons : 1 ) although gate opened one hand , it not easiest ( you move button then lift up , not huge deal , though ) . 2 ) its also not easiest close ( lift up then push down ) . 3 ) it wall mounted ( not pressure mounted ) , so it leaves holes wall . overall , i would recommend it	1
we nine foot opening into kitchen , which entirely off limits my daughter . we large amount small items there could easily choked , besides inherent danger kitchen . so my daughter kept out ! this gate one two would span distance this more affordable . my husband installed it quickly ( within ten minutes getting home ) , adjusted it size we needed , voila ! my daughter turning one this month gate looks like it when we bought it months ago . even when she puts her full body weight against mesh , trying " push " her way through , it doesn't give -- not mesh , seams , hardware , anything . i worried bar below gate annoying or tripped over but it so low ground it never issue . latch gate takes bit get used , but gate stays place even if latch dropped cradle not snapped . love it	1
i purchased this item my 6 month old i love it . it replaces need jacket i unzip bundleme when we out shopping keep my little one getting too hot . i still put hat him when its very cold out but i not problem wind blowing top flap off ( i seen complaint other reviews ) my car seat canopy never issue . material very soft inside my baby very comfortable it . i would highly recommend this product	1

we recently ordered this monitor really like it . it wonderful color during day clearly illuminated up 8 feet away camera night . we 900 mhz 2.4 ghz phones our home not any interference problems monitor . we older two-story home nursery top floor . i laundry basement or cook first floor kitchen both sound picture clear . i especially like time-out feature turns off display screen after few minutes but leaves audio monitor when monitor operating its battery . display turned big button top so if you hear something you want check out , just push button room view . it very nice . monitor belt clip also flip-out stand so it stable counter or wherever . i would recommend this product without reservation .	1
these placemats saved my oak table getting scratched forks etc . they great catching food before it hits floor or my childs lap . love them . i am now ordering set hand !	1
we love this item people always stop us ask where we got it ! it little hard clean , but i feel better using reuseable product taking effort wash it than i would if i used disposable plastic placemats . few wonderful waitstaff folks willingly cleaned it us restaurants . we only use this when we're out . we often wet suction cups help them stick . my 18 month old rip it off , but tells me he eating ! surface also bit clingy , so his toddler trick flinging his arms scatter food little tougher him ! this great product won major daughter-in-law points me my germaphobe mother-in -law	1
after using sunshine kids ultra mat 4 months , i purchased two more mats . this best seat protector i found several reasons : - it doesn't smell . i return everything i bought babies us due heavy rubber smell never went away even after airing products week . - it made two pieces so it used stages . use bottom piece only when using rear-facing infant seat , or both pieces when using front-facing car seat . - it made two pieces so it fits any height car seat . i britax car seat which really tall . other seat protectors not reach all way top my suv seat , so car seat rested directly leather , but this seat protector , i could raise back piece high i needed it fully protect my suv seat . - it thick enough even after months use , there no marks suv leather seats . - it indentations bottom portion accommodate car seats using latch system . note height issue : friend mine bought duomat 2-in-1 car seat mat , which he found very nice well it not smell . he return it however due fact mat not high seat his honda odyssey , his britax marathon car seat very top rested directly honda seat no protector	1
this good quality organizer , good value . i appreciate neutral colors , i no problems using velcro fasteners affix this changing table . middle compartments could little larger , but overall this great way keep some essentials close hand without cluttering up changing table	1
i bought this item little sceptical afetr reading some it negative reviews . i thought it going unsturdy . it light weight but it carried everything perfectly . i put my baby diaper it bunch her little bathroom things . velcro straps little too short my crib which i thought negative first , but i some pretty ribbon i tied it end my crib using little loop-holes back . it gave it prettiest effect . i would recommed this over anything . everything just reach away	1
this little lamb saved us suffering through sleepless nights . our baby loves it , especially whale sounds . really works calm her soothe her sleep almost immediately	1
this bib changed mealtime better ! i tried all sorts fancy bibs because i thought this bib would uncomfortable my tiny baby . boy i wrong ! after initial fuss she now loves this bib . she comfortable clean ! bib catches every drop food , water her super staining vitamin drops ! fyi even this fantastic bib can't shield you unexpected baby sneezes during feedings ! i stained ruined so many cloth bibs before i finally took this out box now i only use this one ! plus one my car go feedings ! more colors please baby bjorn	1
my son now self-feeding , so i looking bib would catch his mistakes but easy clean after each meal . although this bib bit stiff , it great job catching every single thing he drops . , it easy clean - i just wash it dishes after each meal it ready go next meal .	1
my wife i twins recently i went looking ( 3 hours internet searching reading reviews ) all kinds different nursery monitors . i even looked some costing over 500 dollars built wallmounts , ect . pretty much every thing i read said try this one . well they right . rechargable batteries . good clear signal even multi-floors . durable hand sets easy use switch base ( babies room ) other hand set . easy use . durable reliable . good volumn control . good response manufacture amazon when switch went bad . can't ask more than even if it cost twice what i paid . i strongly recommend this set product . i used others they can't touch this one . my babies more importantly my wife emotional well serious consideration finding something would make them feel safe communication . after 3 months continous use , i can't imagine better choice . it even allows us adults quiet time casue we know we hear everything even slightest wimper . yourself favor buy this . jay saldan	1
my son 3 1/2 this first seat his i able assemble get into car without one ounce help my husband . all others left me frustrated baffled . i overcome my fear kids seats this one ! next you'll find me out back putting up swing set all my own ;-) loooove it	1
we bought earlier model this seat when my son 4 , we still using it he turns 8 . we one each our two cars , we keep third out west coast when we there traveling . unlike other review currently posted this seat , we really loved cupholders - there room them pop out our car , so they kept out all time . they work water bottles , crayons , little plastic toys , etc . it held up well abuse , adjusts different sizes , looks sporty , generally gets thumbs up .	1
i live relatively small townhome , my son baby gear taken over most space . activity mats , jumpers , swings , kicking contraptions , i couldn't bring myself buy full-size high chair . i actually bought bumbo seat , hoping i could use this instead high chair , but didn't work out too well . so i pretty excited when i saw this high chair read good reviews . i'm happy report i love this this high chair ! vinyl seat pretty plush looks comfortable . he actually looks like he sitting little throne when he it . i strapped it onto barstool , it feels very secure . vinyl seat , rest chair material , easy clean . tray says dishwasher safe , but my dishwasher too small accommodate it . it doesn't seem highest quality chair , meaning some functions aren't easy use you might hope , like reclining seat tray , but it wouldn't deter me buying it again . it only $50 , so i wouldn't expect it any different . it also very portable , which isn't normal expectation high chair . overall , i'm very happy this product	1
i first admit there additional parts these cups need washed , but since we used dr. brown bottles , i used few pieces . soft spout these cups great , made transitioning cup so easy us . my son hasn't taken bottle since his first birthday , never missed them bit . there two levels spouts , one harder one softer . i've tried other soft spout brands , but leaking collars . avent cups never leak long valves inserted correctly . our little guy use any brand or spout type , but these his favorite nice sore gums . i really recommend these cups despite extra valve pieces ( which i simply pop dishwasher basket ) . you'll never spills your sofa or carpet	1
our child still short 7 months age her feet touch ground , but until she , she enjoys sitting playing it	1
we bought this walker my son when he 8 months old . he immediately loved it always wanted it . this walker so easy him turn corners move all around house . it keeps him busy , happy , hours . tray front also great put snacky-type foods him eat while he it well his sippy cup drink when he needs it . i would reccommend this walker anyone baby , especially baby really wants move	1
intstead adding yet musical instrument toy box , i purchased this her just over 2 yrs age . it our only xylophone , she loved it immediately . i still hear tingling chimes downstairs , when she upstairs bathtime her dad . she makes her own melodies . she hits any note sings her favorite songs it . it held up well	1
my daughter received small fluffles grandma when she 4-5 months old ... she visible reaction it right start , not spent single night without him past 5 years . we bought several backup fluffles , thank goodness , some lost but we able replace . i regularly wash them normal spin cycle normal detergent , i dry them gentle cycle dryer . they not fluffy texture fur changed bit but they held up fine	1
my twins 3 months old sleeping through night month because these blankets . they super soft keep my babies nice warm during cold nights ( especially their hands ) . i worried them pulling their blankets over their faces night swaddling receiving blankets wouldn't hold them ( they wiggle lot ) so these perfect solution . i'm ordering 2 more large size get us through winter . i highly recommend gifting these my expectant friends future .	1
this great idea , which i really thought my baby would enjoy since i read they loved swaddled . but my daughter not like swaddled all . so i ended up returning this product using our halo sleepsacks instead , which gave her hands feet more freedom . my advice purchase only one these before birth then if your baby enjoys swaddled then purchase more , if not you return it or not not feel bad it only $9.99 . also remember once babies move their hands around more freely they should not swaddled .	1
this product works very well . it long range , battery last long reception very good . also feature two ac adaptors helps save battery life receiver	1
i received this gift after my daughter born we used it first time today i love it ! it so soft warm i wish they made them adults ! colors beautiful entire thing washable . only downfall there no way cover her head without her suffocating . luckily there extra fabric top piece i tucked underneath my hand while i carring carseat it block horrible michigan wind . if there 10 stars then urban bundle me would receive all 10	1
my daughter only 2 half , but she off charts height weight . such , she simply didn't fit into her regular car seat anymore . honest , i little apprehensive switching her car seat booster seat before age 3 , but she very uncomfortable her car seat would cry whenever we stuffed her into it . so , i bit proverbial bullet bought this booster . one feature really interested me this seat portability . my father lives out state so we doing lot traveling . i wanted seat we could easily check airplane . this seat fit bill . seat not compact i would hoped , but it no bigger than small piece luggage could easily carried onto plane . however , i think this seat little cumbersome " carry " if you trying manage getting onto plane 2 half year old everything else comes her ( coloring books , portable dvd player , snacks etc ); so i more than likely check this seat . such i am going order carrying case ( i saw some reviews some folks checked seat box it came , but i find too cumbersome ) . seat itself , my daughter loves it . she very comfortable it calls it her " big girl seat " -- no more fights getting her into her seat !!! i love it compartment store owner manual so you always it hand . also , even though it not five point harness , i feel my daughter very secure it . i love it wrap around headrest , height couldn't easier adjust -- we figured it out before we even opened manual . when you thread shoulder belt through " catch " under headrest , it positions belt correctly over your child body so he/she not choked it . ( make sure you pull belt all way out then let it slowly wind itself back until it taut over your child -- this lock belt place ) . i would given this seat five stars if it folded down little more compactly and/or came carrying case ( it built handle , but if you going check this plane , i would feel more comfortable it something protect fabric ripping , staining etc ) . overall this great product which comparably priced other full booster seats which don't fold . i recommended this my friends	1
i 2.5 year old 16 month old this bag leaves my hands free carry them or hold hands without constantly adjust bag . it perfect size take just what we need not bogged down inconvient bag . very bottom pocket very easy get into without taking bag off , it great place your wallet keys . if you need carry sippy cups not bottles make sure they not too tall or they won't fit middle compartment ( which meant bottles ) bottle attachment good store snacks if you don't need carry bottle	1
i love it ! great way keep my daughter touching/chewing cart me touch cart handle . there loops attach toys 2 side pockets hold small items . i find material thickness perfectly fine , i mean come this isnt carseat it fabric meant barrier baby cart . if it padded or organizer back it would too bulky take up cart space . only reason i didnt give it 5 stars because safety belt too long it isnt attached product which means it most likely get lost ( mine ) overall great product makes excellent babyshower gift .	1
my daughter received this her first birthday still plays it two years later ! we've able use it naming colors , matching shapes , putting together different musical compositions . cartridge african beats/irish jig lot fun . we haven't any trouble dropping this toy it not playing ( it dropped/thrown/kicked .... loved ? ) . my only complaint price ! ( reason 4 stars )	1
bundle me nice accessory during cold winter months . it attaches very easily carseat , i leave all extra blankets home ( except light one ) . this particular model wind rain resistant , which nice keeping my little one dry . it great concept ; kudos whomever invented it ! i 2 complaints though . first , it not effective younger babies . my daughter just 7 weeks old , i don't zip up all way . this keeps fabric out her face . i use one light blanket until she bigger bundle me bit more snug around her . secondly , zippers aren't smooth i'd like them . they occasionally catch fabric inside , so zipping up sometimes more work , always when i'm hurry ! but overall , i'm glad i bought this . it nice barrier against wind , rain cold just one item	1
i couldn't imagine traveling wandering toddler alone all carry-ons car seat . this car seat carrier sure life saver . it easy use , easy roll easy fold store . it makes big difference those wheels . my only concern this product fabric , it thinner than i expected . if it sturdier fabric , it would perfect	1

my daughter breastfed , we started her 1 bottle day breastmilk when she 3.5 weeks old . she started using playtex ventair , no problems over month . then , all sudden , she went bottle strike . we tried different bottles ( dr. browns , avent , cheapies ) different nipple flows - she wouldn't take any them . when i found out soothie made bottles , i thought it definately worth try , since only pacifier she would take . she took soothie bottle instantly	1
minute we opened box i knew i made right desicion purchase this stroller . weight unbelieveable , ride smooth - one finger push what it takes ! my 7 mos . old baby girl looked very comfortable it , recline pretty good infant ( 2 hr nap proof ) . my previous purchase britax blue blaze ( sold it craigs list day after we received it ) big mistake . spend little more get whole lot . good stroller good investment	1
these great - our 8 month old can't rip them off table like she everything else that not taped down ! one note , though , you can't use them restaurant booster seat trays - you need totally flat surface . overall though , placemats great , cute designs , bonus purell doesn't hurt either	1
little annoying first , but once you get used them , they great	1
if you planning stay home you going pump only couple times day ( maybe 2 or 3 ) this great pump . i didn't know how use it first but after calling medela customer support line i able use it easily . i didn't rate it 5 stars only because you can't use it many times throughout day ( your hands would hurt ) . but other than i think great pump price	1
i really recommend this product ... our baby not like bassinet some reason , newborn , we didn't want him too far us . this perfect solution , although i would agree some other users it takes up quite bit room bed . but i honestly didn't mind little squished given my son slept so well it he right next us . , it great travel	1
i bought snuggle nest when my son almost 10 weeks old . we realized he slept better smaller more confining places where he could touch sides all times . he sleeping through night his baby carriage but getting too long it . this perfect . i put it his crib ( bottom so he couldn't wiggle out ) he continued sleep through night	1
we used floppy seat couple years when our daughter young . it extremely easy use . no , i didn't usually install it one hand while holding my daughter ( although i few times - it not hard ); i normally parked near cart , put cover ran belt through , then took my daughter out her car seat placed her shopping cart . ( why carry your baby heavy diaper bag through parking lot if you don't need ! :-) ) it bit stiff get into stuff sack first , but after one or two washings , it cinch put it stuff sack when we finished using it . it fit all shopping carts we used , including oversized ones costco . it held up well repeated washings - bit faded , but still looking fairly brigh t.t here hardly time we went shopping someone didn't come over say " oh ! i wish we'd one those when my children small " . overall , we very pleased this product	1

we just came back vacation over holidays used toteatot first time . it lifesaver ! i purchased it right before we went away because i agonizing how we going manage all logistics maneuvering through airport all gifts bringing , plus our luggage ourselves , without losing one our kids process ! it worked just it promised . it easy attach suitcase car seat . our son happy clam getting wheeled through airport . we could easily bring his car seat plane without lug it through airport ! car seat must-have airport happy child happy neighboring passengers ! we able carry our gifts carry-on because we didn't want check them , we brought carry-on suitcase case our other checked luggage lost , we'd least essentials our little one rest us . we no problems it all . it pockets us store my son bottle , we able use backpack portion toteatot hold his diapers some toys . i read review where they experienced issue buckle , but we no problem all , fact , i worried we perhaps over-weighing it because all stuff we hanging off our roller suitcase ( besides just toteatot , car seat our son , like my handbag , laptop computer ) , but again , no problems all . just lots smiles curious faces airport ! i'd highly recommend it .	1
these wonderful ! when you first get them thick fluffy - so soft ! after some washes ( washing soda borax ) i found mine aren't soft , but they still very nice . they thick . my baby heavy wetter rarely soaks all way through these . picture this website makes it look like front diaper isn't contoured , but it . it just not wide front back , it should . if you like you just use these pin either side they'd work great without anything else , though there no elastic prevent leaks out side outside would get damp . you also can't tell picture there rectangular doubler sewn into inside these - one line stitching right down center hold it place . it full length diaper . i think i would rather it stitched both sides so one side wouldn't accidentally get folded over wrong way , but then perhaps would caused bunching problems . i use bummis super whisper wrap diaper covers these they fit perfectly . i no complaints . after numerous washings they haven't started fall apart like some others . i really like them	1

any pregnant woman knows , some point during gestation it becomes nearly impossible sleep comfortably . when you can't sleep your back , you can't sleep your stomach , your only choice balance your side your belly slowly pulling you off balance , your body actually gets pretty tired . after getting very little , uncomfortable sleep some weeks , i searched desperately relief . i intended purchase snooggle full length body/pregnancy pillow since they it target online where my baby registry . some time passed i decided go straight target person get snoogle only find it not there . but , boppy pillow i got it right away . i say it one best products i bought during my pregnancy . i would not good nights sleep without it . some people complain preggo pillows they bought take up too much room bed , but this one nicely shaped hug your body cushion where it needed without too much extra bulk . slipcover comes it very pretty easy take off wash . it also comes zippable pillowcase you fold whole thing into make one nice round pillow . i am still using this pillow after my son born , since it folds nicely different ways makes nice pillow just recline . definitely must any pregnant woman ! you won't regret it	1

i purchased this product because i crib converted toddler bed , but it didn't come any kind railing keep my little guy falling out . since toddler bed uses crib mattress , i little concerned large size bolster -- it covers entire length mattress -- but my son figured out how climb right over it get into out bed . it pop off mattress sometimes when he getting or out , but it isn't too difficult strap it back when i tuck him . i couldn't find any other kind railing fit my son bed , so bedbugz saved me just pile pillows floor next bed	1

we bought this same high chair 10 years ago when my first daughter born we absolutely loved it !! time , only reason we bought it because they it all white we didn't want one colors all over it . but far high chair goes we loved every thing it , super easy clean reclining positions great determined 4 month old .. ( they always want table everyone ) . also , many times my kids fell asleep while eating rather than wake them , all i recline seat they would sleep out problem because it such comfy seat cover . it held up wonderfully 7 years . we thought we kids got rid it , now i am expecting again i researched high chairs all over again , decided this model still best your money out there . we buying this again !	1
i two kids use my evenflo carseat . i hated it . it like they never even tried it out see how well its features worked . i finally got so sick it when my 2nd child 4 months old i ordered babytrend flexloc . first i seduced high safety ratings , but even after consumer reports article rescinded , i still liked lot features . pros : -very comfy seat , good padding -the canopy twice long my evenflo so it cover baby almost completely- canopy stays place ; it doesn't fall forward or backward behind seat- tightening mechanism under baby feet easy reach very easy adjust make straps tighter or looser depending what baby wearing- harness mechanism very easy adjust ( shoulder strap height ) . my evenflo rethreaded every few months even my mechanically inclined husband said it horrible . flexloc just dial back you turn--it breeze . - seat transfered cars without base . it strapped directly car using seat belt car seat or using latch system if your car it . - triangular handle nice grip easy hold any position- this carseat lighter than my evenflo- cloth very wipeable , not absorbant spills stains my evenflocons : i found few minor cons definitely would not deter me buying this carseat , one might ( depending how i resolve it once i contact babytrend ) . - release button take seat off its base toes under seat . it little harder reach than ones behind head if carseat backward facing . - others said , buttons move handle bit stiff , but not horribly so . i prepared them way worse . - handle thinner doesn't feel sturdy my evenflo when carrying baby around , but it hasn't any problems-this one big one i check babytrend : twice when i turned corner sharply , carseat tipped 45 degree angle ! i tightened down seatbelt much i could , putting my full weight it using seatbelt retracting mechanism . but maybe i'm still not doing it right . base narrower than my evenflo , so maybe that why ? so i need contact babytrend see if they any suggestions . until then , i guess i'll take corners slower ! overall , i felt like this seat major improvement over my evenflo even over graco snugrides i checked out store . it intelligently designed easy use adjust baby grows . i would recommend it sure . just make sure you strap it tightly or use latch system if you it	1
we just received this bed it really nice bed price . my husband i very little trouble putting it together . we highly recommend it	1
i love this changing pad ; it great no matter where you ! i change my son diaper some crazy places i know he clean this surface it easy wipe clean if he makes mess . it little cushion it well case you need use it hard surfaces it folds up fit my small diaper bag nicely . i really like wipe pocket small zipper pocket too	1
i loved my doorway jumper . noise i could've without . it really kind claws it way into your head then you hear it when you lay down take nap want sneak other room toss it . but said , i don't know what these other reviewers talking . my baby great time her jumper it fabulous way burn fifteen minutes . anymore than i recommend exersaucer . i mean , how long you just jump before it gets boring . just put jumper wide doorway you won't problem baby hitting their hand against doorway or whatever people complained . god sake , when your kid over like 20 pounds move something else . all it all , i think this great investment	1
this best car seat i owned . i three children owned many " light weight " " easy use " car seats but explorer best one yet . extremely light weight easy carry . base best part clear bubble levels both sides easy one hand isntallation . it uses seatbelt like clips hold " latch " system connections place . only down side required use base but extremely minor issue newborn car seat . excellent product ..	1
fabric good quality . it different textures animals seem pop out you . my two month old loves staring it . matching mobile , sold seprately , worth look , too . it doesn't any fancy lights or anything , but my son adores it .	1
zanzibar best ! we love it all . it good quality wecouldn't imagine our nursery anything else . we so picky what we wanted , but we made right choice . we recommend everything zanzibar line . ( we got most things babiesrus-baby depot some other things babiesrus didn't - light fixtures , nightlight , etc .	1
my daughter turn two loves pretend cook feed her dolls . i chose order this item her birthday during free shipping promotion after seeing poor choices play food offered my local toy stores . it disappointing most play food available fast-food branded ( i.e. mcdonalds) ! even " knock-off " tubs play food primarily junk food - hot dogs , donuts , cupcakes , ice cream cones , etc . i chose this set because it consists foods my daughter primarily eats - fruits vegetables , eggs , cheese , bread , etc . some pieces solid plasic , some hollow , which leaves greater question durability . but even hollow pieces made very thick , rather ridged plastic which i think stand up ok over time . i am not even able squeeze them myself . i also like foods small side actually fit small pots pans sets available right now ( although we set aside few questionably small things , like carrots mushrooms , until she older ) . definitely worth price , i think , when free shipping available .	1
i purchased this thermometer 18 mos ago absolutely love it . it quick easy use , there no maintenance . those who trouble finding probe covers , they sold walgreens or any other drugstore . they not first year brand , but walgreens brand works just well . i hope this helps . please consider this theremometer , your children thank you because unintrusive , painless readings	1
i loved this piece furniture . good solid construction priced well when purchased matching storage unit bins	1
this must item . it makes bath time so much easier ! i using this since my baby 5 months . he 90% weight scale i never problems getting him out seat . course you still watch them all times ! but this seat gives baby some freedom splash play out option crawling around tub . highly recommended	1
my baby loved this car seat start . we've used it through all stages , including rear-facing , now forward facing my currently 19 month old toddler . seat easy adjust baby grows , easy install using latch system . removable infant padding perfect . biggest bonus adjustable crotch strap padded cover shield prevent chafing scratching baby legs . i'm due my next baby month already added second one these my baby registry . wonderful car seat ... you not disappointed . ( note this seat quite heavy , best permanent installation single car . i would not recommend it repeated swithching other cars because it weight .	1
i saw mother store one before our daughter born thought it good idea buy one well . i use it everytime every store dont leave home without it	1
i searched high low double stroller wouldn't break bank i very happy my purchase . i two-year-old son five-month-old daughter both kids like facing forward . i also like side-by-side style . i couldn't see myself pushing " stretch limo " i've heard it called . it easy maneuver , i fit down most aisles , it fits trunk my compact car full load groceries . drawbacks : canopy could bit higher , ( my son thinks it game when i pull it forward immediately pushes it back ) , seat covers velcroed place tend slip when i put kids , i need fold it before it fit through front door house . i've also taken it two cross-country plane trips layovers . baggage handlers general aren't very gentle front bars come off fairly easily when stroller folded . one now small rip it , but i'm lucky it didn't get lost . overall , i've happy it	1
we this seat my husband car , so i not used this much our infant seat . now my son outgrowing infant seat , i using it more often . i bought it great ratings , only thing i don't really get why there prickly velcro side straps where baby arms rest . i'm wondering if i'm doing something wrong . it seems like velcro hold straps out way putting child seat , but when buckled , they sitting top his legs . i am also looking car seat stroller fit this , no idea where look ! i'll post again , after i use this seat more , but so far , so good	1
this works well , but if your door handles thin , you may need add some additional padding make sure this springs back locked position . i taped some cardboard around some our very thin " elegant " door handles make this fit better . note some reviews elsewhere state installing this one side your door could lock you out other side . flat out wrong , regardless what type handle or button other side door . i used screws -- i wouldn't count double-sided tape protect my child . if you use tape , then i would try kind comes 3m removable hangars . it very strong removes without damaging surfaces	1
we use this our daughter crib it great . it easy install durable .	1
i looking toddler cot take trips my grandson . i think i found best one market ! this cot so easy use it travels like dream . i set it up myself i able collapse it return it it carry bag myself well . furthermore , my grandson thought it great	1
i 6 1/2 month old twins , so needless say , i need all help i get . i found hip hammock far easier more comfortable than sling style carrier . i such great experience this i'm getting second one keep sized my husband so we both carry baby same time - walks or other outings , or even just around house . i highly recommend this product . it very easy , very comfortable	1
this wonderful car seat . ( i purchased it cobblestone design ) it wonderfully made convertible car seat , much better value higher-priced alternative car seats . we britax before purchasing this one , i think i'll definitely stick evenflo ! this one best-rated car seats , less than half price britax ! it super sturdy , great safety features , everything you'd want great car seat . it little bigger than i expected , trouble getting it my car , but we used infant car seat so i didn't keep mind it'd bigger because baby bigger ! also , firs t-t ime parents , i would definitely recommend getting convertible car seat instead infant car seat . infant car seats only maximum 22 lbs , baby usually reach 7 months ! i paid $200 infant seat , hardly got any use out it ! convertible ones go until child reaches 40 lbs . much smarter more economical choice .	1
we already evenflo triumph premier . after few initial problems one , we got used it my ( large ) 9 month old son very comfortable it . i decided buy titan because it also good safety ratings lighter than triumph . second seat , we wanted something more lightweight portable since it would moved my husband car grandparents ' cars . it very easy use , equally comfortable triumph , but slightly less plush . i find more simplistic harness adjustment much less struggle titan . my husband #1 complaint expensive triumph . good all around seat purchase . no complaints	1
our daughter this seat since she 7 months old . it fantastic !!! she now 3 1/2 i recently invested $50 into seat . i replaced harness hugs fortunate find new cover clearance children shop seattle . it now looks like brand new ! we use it 2001 toyota tacoma double cab , 1996 chevy suburban , 2003 bmw x5 . toyota bmw get proper fit we remove head rests . no problem ! wieght , i am ok lug heavy seat if it means my child best protected she . when you get seat into whatever car you want it , my recommendation literally climb into seat one knee pushing much your weight into seat possible . we this when installing ours it doesn't move millimeter ...... our daughter always comfortable big cushy seat , doesn't slump when she falls asleep , can't escape it , i never deal twisted straps ! well worth money , * inconvenience * weight size . crazy people would spend money this knowing it safest seat then just because it heavy put your child piece junk car . accident only going happen car best seat ?? think again !! take time it right ! if you trouble installing it find local fire department or insurance agency properly install it you !!	1
i cannot say enough positive things this item ! i absoloutely loved fact it helped keep my son warm cool nights but it safe enough him use his crib every night . this item needs brought mainstream so it available all parents their kids .	1
these wonderful ! my baby getting uncomfortable swaddled three months , so we decided make switch sleep sacks . we worried her arms free she might hard time falling and/or staying asleep . this true first so we started only putting her these during daytime - light cotton one . after week she not waking early her naps anymore after two weeks we tried her it night - she slept straight through night ( she when she swaddled ) . so transition painless she seemed much happier baby able reach her hands move her arms . while i didn't notice shrinkage i notice zipper bunch up bit , but this hasn't problem . sometimes my daughter sucks it if it gets close her mouth , but she reach it - it doesn't cover her face all or trap air she could rebreathe . i didn't like these don't sleeves so i tried carter sleep sacks found sleeves too short hard get my daughter . those sacks only come one size which my daughter already outgrown four months ( 14 lbs , 24 inches ) . she also outgrown small size sleep sack , but medium size fits her perfectly some room grow . i didn't want use fleece first since it polyester . i wanted use cotton . but we've found she sleeps longer seems prefer he heavier fabric fleece one . also , we only bought these blue even though we girl because color calming our easily overstimulated baby . we've washed these many times they look just good hold together just well they originally . we've also found you put your baby into next larger size without it so big they get their arms out or it bunches up around their face . so after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks day one	1

this great little stroller me i am japan where you really need stroller fits small spaces . stroller very sturdy but light which great quick trips out car . recline good my 4 month old but i put neck insert extra support when she falls asleep . basket decent size this size stroller(will fit small purse or diaper bag ) . it folds very nicely handle side carrying . thing i like it canopy hugh covers my daughter completely . i love fact it comes all accessories too ! i really don't any complaints exept handles don't adjust so taller person might say they too short(i'm only 5'2 " ) . overall i would recommend this stroller anyone .	1

my husband i purchased this gate reduce damage our walls sturdy top stairs gate , we steep staircase several stairs . gate very sturdy , overall easy install . only tricky thing installation knowing how properly lift open gate after tightening screws . gate close its own without lift gate handle instructions mention , but after looking packaging how gate supposed look after it installed , how lift door , we tighten screws further into cups wall achieve proper closure . would recommend this gate those small children , it very sturdy , but if there elderly persons household , they may need assistance opening gate	1

our 2 year old daughter small-side when she started potty training so sitting big potty little scary her . handles side little brace back helped her feel more stable . i would recommend it small toddlers who might fell little insecure sitting adult-size toilet first . it look nice too , so we don't mind it sitting our bathroom .	1
we ordered these my daughter 2 years ago when she born they made nice , thick cotton . one i just received made thin , cotton fabric not nearly nice . they really overpriced too my opinion . but they still best swaddling blankets out there .	1

i write this , this car seat not available amazon , but i wanted give it review case they get it stock again . i bought this my son who out grew his infant carseat when he 5 months old . i wasn't ready switch him his " big boy " carseat yet because i like fact i take him out car without waking him up . this seat great because it goes up 30lbs 32 iches , but seat itself heavy . also , many reviewers said , fabric not breathable my son sweats like crazy it . canopy nice big , but it falls down back when not use nuisance . i ended up taking it off after 2 months . all all we love seat , it just needs different fabric something stop canopy falling down back	1
we looked tons baby seats when our son outgrew his infant seat . i wanted something would still fit he got bigger . it added bonus airline certified , so if we ever need fly somewhere i know he buckled up safely . my husband says it dream install we switch it easily grandpa car . i also like peace mind knowing it high safety rating . it very expensive , but i believe it worth it it good up 100lbs , so i plan use it several years .	1
i ton research before buying this seat , we loved it so much we bought ! it far easiest use ( i've used lot car seats ! ) best features . i really like you don't take seat out adjust harness height . fact this seat used forward facing up 65lbs 49 " what sold me it most . i wish this seat around my first child , who off charts height , we put him booster seat age 2 because he too tall any car seat we could find . total side impact protection big selling point , no other seat ! it easy install , rear forward facing-i used it explorer , escape tahoe no problems . people said it bulky , but it not really any larger then other seats , just taller . compare them side side store you see :-) seat also very comfortable long trips ( 8hrs no complaints ! ) . thing i really like this seat straps don't get twisted ! we alpha omega straps forever twisted such pain ! we using this seat year no complaints what so ever . there so many wonderful things this seat i could go all day . i seat inspected person told me britax best , far exceeding us safety standards . it well worth price peace mind you . we also britax parkway booster seat total side impact protection love it well ! ps- i read others seat cover not machine washable , i washed it delicate cold water it no damage-looks good new	1

i'm not certain why there so many glowing reviews this product . my wife registered this item because 4 stage tub looked good theory . unfortunately , because collapsible design this " bath " tub not hold water , it just runs out seam where two sides come together . there foam gasket around seam intended hold water , but it useless . sling useful bathing infant , removable ring it job keeping infant upright while learning sit . unfortunately , time our infant ready sit we already replaced this piece junk . i guess they call it safety 1st your kid can't drown dry bath tub	-1
this high chair great start , but after while tray table would come loose one side during meals . i thought it me , first , not latching it correctly but we soon realized it my 9 month old releasing clasp . reluctant change chairs we persevered now , 3 months later , she remove both sides entirely send tray its contents crashing floor . i am worried she either trap her fingers tray comes loose or bruise her legs tray falls ground . if you looking chair last you into toddler-hood your child learns quickly , don't buy this one . i am looking replacement before my daughter hurts herself	-1

i bought this because i love all other fisher price aquarium stuff we . but ... we haven't thrilled this tub . hammock only used until baby 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child over 9 lbs birth ... so she used it like 2 weeks . even so , hammock sags onto this hard bump middle hammock so baby back rests this bump . never seemed comfortable . then we used it hammock attached only top like instructions say but our daughter outgrew infant side because her butt would slide right over bump supposed support her but she can't sit up use other side . there better tubs out there	-1

i bought this my 4month old christmas , i liked pretty , bright colors sounds foot pad would make .. she little small when i put her , but nothing thin blanket tucked around her support wouldn't fix , pillow under her feet . she wasn't heavy enough yet push foot pad make noise , all those things she would grow into though . part i couldn't over look though how close all toys her head how hard toys . she tried chew see-saw ( teething , everything goes mouth ) it too hard hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back bumped it mirror behind her . it pitiful sight . poor baby . i don't know why they didn't allow just little more tray space curved silly bar out more so they wouldn't bump their heads . i think little more thought put into product it could great toy , but it now i think it just little too " rough around edges " . i took mine back store then bought evenflo , she fits it much better so far she loves it .	-1
i got this my older son , 8 , regular type wedge . this one doesn't keep my new infant going side position his back , nor he stay same height it . every night he slides down his head towards top his head wedges . this me tremendous suffocation hazard . i very excited get this gift even registered it , but very disappointed it performance . also , foam lost its bouyancy after less than month . there indentation where i laid my son .	-1

okay , starters , i look various other reviews thought i would take my chance . it seemed good outweighed bad . until ... i bought it am trying install it ( we speak but got irritated so am taking break write this . ) where begin , locking mechanism seems fine if you get it install first place . however , manufacter only includes screws wood walls . which mean , if you dont wood walls you go buy other screws ! i drywall screws not reliable . second , i bought this gate extension ( 24 " , only one there ) because top my stairs measure 44 1/2 inches . this gate supposed fit extension . it doesnt . i tried over hour get it fit it doesnt fit even extension . it would without extension however there 5 inch gap wall bolts each side bolts all way unscrewed also . needless say if i want this gate work , i go my local hardware store buy new hardware so this mount securly or i take it back store find something else . unless i figure out way make it fit how it , this gate waste my time my money . only reason i gave it 2 stars because im sure it would just fine if i wood walls it fit where i install it . now i holes my wall confussion trying figure out how make it fit if its all possible . doesnt look like it though .	-1

frustration how i sum up my experience this product . front cover , directions back , there photo key locks unlocks magnetic lock . however , after opening packaging , there no key . there four locks , alright . , lots little screws case you felt like screwing lock , despite product claim only child lock doesn't require tools . how packaging designed , i don't even think there room key . which makes me wonder ... you buy key separately ? i'm returning this product am bitterly disappointed wasted time energy	-1

i purchased this rail today my daughter crib " converts " into toddler bed . everything outside box looked great , until we got home , put it together put it crib . there only 6 inches space my daughter climb out bed . also it sits 3 inches which significantly reduces amount sleep space . after playing it awhile , i decided look over instructions again . it states warning section this rail only bed box spring mattress not intended crib or toddler bed . my question " why didn't it say this outside box ?!

i read reviews this decided despite some negative comments give it try since it so cheap .... first i impressed this shade because it attached quite easily my stroller actually provided shade my baby ( although not much it looks like it would - his legs never protected sun even though it looked liked they would because shade so big ) . my stroller pretty typical stroller , nothing special or comlpicated it . but yes , it flip up wind or even small breeze very easily i weigh it down which didn't really work because it so flimsy . after 2 weeks it lost its shape completely front it flipped up no longer provided coverage all . piece junk .	-1

well , i just tried bundle me ( toddler size ) my 20-month old our jog stroller first time today i am disappointed because it definitely already too small . he really can't sit bag unless his legs bent , which he hates . plus , when i bag pulled far down possible stroller ( only way i get him all ) , then it only zips just above his waist -- definitely not high enough really get warm snuggly . i'll keep bag baby #2 , but i'm really disappointed i can't use it my not quite 2-year old .	-1
this seat very dangerous set my daughter potty training back months . seat folded fell into toilet while she sitting it ! thank goodness i still holding her ! she get pinched afraid sit toilet few months after ! potty training stressful enough child without defective product making it worse ! only reason i gave it star there not way save review out one	-1
price this cradle/swing , i'd hoped lot more quality reliability than i got . first , stand seemed little wobbly -- you really need make sure feet wide possible when setting it up they don't lock into optimal position . even worse , however , after less than two days use , lights , sound , mobile stopped working . calls " customer service " complete waste time i ended up returning item . while netting other features appeared attractive desirable , i'd recommend purchasing less expensive papasan cradle/swing	-1
i 3 4 year old this device little deter or prevent them raiding fridge while their mom i asleep . couple good , hard yanks your child this device fails . this might me good product infants toddlers , but if your child over 2 years old , try something else like lock release fridge latch safety 1st ( but aware even though these far superior , you'll still place 3 these safety 1st latches your fridge door keep little ones defeating them . that what worked us anyway . i'll so glad when they grow out this fridge fascination .	-1
these bags leaked me both top bottom . fold-down mechanism very cumbersome especially because plastic very stiff . i lost three bags milk due leaks . if you transport bags anywhere , like back forth work like i , i would avoid these bags . they just leaked all over place me , even after i carefully re-sealed each one exactly according package instructions . i would recommend lanisoh bags over these .	-1
unfortunately you correct - these not same premium heavyweight cloth diapers used come gerber . when i called company ( i use these cloth diapers my business ) ask , they told me this same product . it not . they quilt wrinkle after one washing , just don't hold up their shape general . amazon needs update their site , because packaging changed well . i miss old diapers !	-1
we used these bottles three weeks , we very skeptical they actually work well they supposed . there some additional drawbacks well . 1 ) these leak travel . twice we've gone park 7oz , arrived 4 mess bag . 2 ) we see no difference reducing gas . while these designed take gas away collar , what all air nipple where air first enters ? this gimmic ? 3 ) flow too fast . we went bottles smaller holes less flow these , which far too fast infant	-1
i'm currently process adopting my son , i bought this take guatemala me when i visited . it never worked - it didn't matter how much water i put chamber , it would never cycle more more than 30 seconds . i then wait approximately 5 minutes it cool back down before using it 30 second cycle . i ended up filling ice bucket hot water , letting bottle sit warm up . needless say , it sent back . i think i'll just use microwave when baby gets home - it got easier quicker than this thing	-1
i purchased this swing because we wanted something take back forth our parents house . though i am very sorry i purchased it . when you place baby swing- seat lays almost flat/horizontal ( foot part swing much higher than head position ?? )very weird ?? while it swings , i am afraid my daughter could end up tipping seat backwards land floor . also , there no head support . box it says it age appropriate birth 25lbs- this not case . my daughter only 4 months old she hold her head- but not too great yet there no head support this swing . my daughter ends up leaning way over one side swing- it doesn't seem support other swings . i swing head support positioning way swing sits much better . add- mobile horrible . it really pitiful hard believe fisher price put something like market . entire swing poor design it .	-1
what more i say ? these bottles leak all over place . i switched dr. brown , they great . no leaks , my son spits up less . not buy avent bottles nipples - they leak like crazy , cause huge mess	-1
i purchased this item target return it store . wedge comes 2 pieces foam , foam inserted into cover . foam isn't problem , it cover . zipper goes right down middle , so it can't comfortable baby lay zipper poking out under their head/neck . i would recommend crib wedge comes one piece . if zipper side , product would great	-1

i bought this sling when my son 8 months old 19 pounds . he hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around see world . i hated this carrier because rigid straps cut into my hips shoulder every time he tried move . seller recommended making sure straps place correctly ( i tried numerous positions . there isn't place your body where unforgiving straps particularly comfortable ) also said tighten straps so baby couldn't move around . i all these things still found it very uncomfortable wear . seller helpful product arrived promptly , so i gave it 2 stars instead 1 . ( note : there $5 return charge . )	-1
i only turtle fishing net . turtle : turtle used 5 months while my nephew stayed me then put up until my new baby would able use it . i dryed out all bath toys they stored open air toy bin 6 months . i finally felt my daughter ready toys bath put turtle water noticed black stuff floating water . there mold/mildew growing inside turtle . i tried washing it bleach water , but more kept coming out even after repeated washings . i finally just gave up threw it out . i several other squirt toys stored turtle none them same problem . fish net : paint fish net peeling off after only 5 months use . fish themselves fine .	-1
this item suggested me my local birth center . i should noticed word " wrap " , but i didn't give it too much thought . there two main problems this baby carrier : 1 . you wrap every time you want use it which problematic if you other kids who need attention if you wanting use it out house . i live sw florida where summertime it 100+ degrees . there no way i could stand parking lot , wrap myself up , put baby get my other child without suffering serious heat exhaustion . 2 . it hot . yes , this nice , stretchy breathable fabric , but , fabric much , much bulkier than standard baby carriers . again , i hate harp weather here , but there no way i could take my other child park wear this unless all i underneath tank top . i'm also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you those special nursing shirts slits them . otherwise , you'd jack your shirt up underneath baby carrier feed them . plus side , it easy get wrapped up easy put baby doll out .	-1
i bought this wipe warmer weather got colder here georgia so far not impressed . two problems . 1 ) wipes stay warm . 0042 secod so time you pop them out get them your son tushy they lukewarm best . 2 ) they advertise how intelligent their top warming design it , but that only wipes touching top product . once you get half way through your wipes , there isn't any way those wipes benefit warming device ( placed directly below lid ) since they cannot reach it . they should install some sore spring device so all wipes touching warmer no matter how low your wipe supply getting . i continue use it but wish i though more product design	-1
first all diapers get stuck lid , then room starts smell like baby poop . yes you use reg bags it , only + it . first day after changing bag it smells ok but buy 2nd wow it stinks so badly when you open it change bag smell unbearable .	-1
we first original diaper champ , which i would given 4 stars . it kept odor pretty well , easy use , used regular trash bags ... etc . we really liked it until one day velcro tab diaper pulled foam out lid . since it letting odor out , we decided replace it new improved model . worst diaper pail ever . soon diapers start piling up , lid grabs tabs , wipes , etc jams top so you can't flip it . i spent so much time shaking , wiggling kicking thing i very quickly exasperated . when you flip top , it created much bigger gaps two sides than older model . this why things get jammed ... also why it lets huge waft diaper odor out every time you flip it . horrible	-1
this cute turtle terrific week . my toddler loved it enjoyed stars color options . unfortunately , button you press turn it fell off inside turtle after week use . i one pressing button when it came off , i wasn't rough or using excessive force . we shake turtle get button out but couldn't re-fasten it easily . few days we stuck finger small hole where button used activate turtle , but then rubber sensor fell off well . no way turn thing , we threw it away . my toddler sooooo sad , but it worthless us . since this overall popular product , i suppose we just bad luck . i wouldn't buy one , though	-1
we bought this our son after experiencing some dirty or too large public toilets . my husband tried use it first time yesterday could not get it fit toilet restaurant there no way he could lift my son it without it slipping . i thought i would give it try today when we out breakfast . typical toilet einstein bagels . i hard time getting it stay , lifted my son up placed him seat . he let out horrible scream i lifted him up threw seat cover floor . he bleeding . primo folding potty seat cut him his behind !!!!!! this product not fit toilets , handles blocking where legs should go instead protecting him , it hurt him . we just bring disinfecting wipes now . not buy this !!!	-1

i never got use this sheet . i pre-washed it put it dry low heat i've all baby clothes . i later saw label said air dry , which seems ridiculous something that'll washed so often . anyway , it shrunk doesn't fit over co-sleeper mattress . if you time/space air dry it , it probably fine product .	-1

when i learned i expecting triplets , i bought large inventory these bottles which i thought best out there . boy , i wrong ! these bottles leak , not just once while but almost every feeding . i am constantly " double checking " them hopes they won't leak all over my babies . i now cover my babies cloth diaper so they don't get soaked when - surprise ! - bottle leaks all over them . yes , i've read directions no , i don't over tighten bottles . you can't take them you feedings go since they leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag . they especially leaky when i prepare bottles advance store them refrigerator . there something cold or condensation affects seal . bottle must disassembled , top wiped dry then reassembled . lots fun three bottles - especially 3 am feedings . even if i am doing something wrong , bottle requires this much precision assembly not leak not very good product . if i hadn't bought so many , i'd throw them all away get something else . take it someone who using these bottles three times often - they waste money source constant aggravation	-1
i purchased this seat because safety factor consumer reports reported . comparing seat graco snugride , however , i am very disappointed tough , very dense foam low back/sacral region seat . foam goes down certain point baby low back , then disappears , leaving dip baby buttocks . just imagine sitting recliner support only down low-back region ( buttocks not supported ) ... not comfortable . i wonder how baby backside would stand up traumatic jolt seat ... well , i'm not going take any chances . baby trend should consulted physical therapist ( like me ) before designing this seat .	-1
we loved this toy when my daughter received it christmas . she loved lay her crib look it recently even learned turn it herself ! this morning i looked toy noticed water compartment almost empty ! water drained out compartment it belongs back part which contains musical mechanisms battery connections ! it not exactly fixable , so we move crib toy	-1
i purchased dr. brown bottles after birth my boy/girl twins hopes helping my son his gasiness . they help ease his suffering but he also put soy which seemed help most . this point , both babies become attached these bottles wouldn't use anything else . first i thought i must doing something wrong them continually leak , sometimes pour out rim bottle . ( i total 4 kids through lots different types bottles , none this bad ! ) we tried everthing stop leaks - * using only all dry parts each new bottle*not heating or storing fridge valve stem inside*not overfillingafter entire year frustration these leaking bottles i noticed when my son would hold it nipple or squeeze nipple , milk would come pouring down sides ! finally , answer leaks !!! truly great idea i hope they try perfect it , but these major design flaw - babies drenched formula middle night no fun . these items meant baby use , price it should help make babies ' mom life easier . stick avent or playtex liners . thank you good luck	-1
i loved gate . so when i moved my new house found doorways wider than gate , i needed extension . it well worth it . my daughter always pulling it hanging it , it still stays very sturdy within doorway . i am also happy we got re-use hands free gate because i would hated fasten gate right onto wall make holes my wall . this gate great purchase	-1
i love other sleep sacks , you see my full review them their web pages . but this sack different fabric which i really , really don't like . it isn't actually quilted . it woven look like it . material such it attracts hair lint it dryer it catches fabric so it takes bit light tugging get it off . it also catches any hang nails or rough skin . when it warm i use cotton sleep sacks when it cold i use fleece ( polyester ) ones . great sacks , just annoying fabric this one	-1
our first baby , we determined stay away lure cute but unnecessarily expensive baby items . this one few items we not research we purchased this tub thinking any tub would work . we wrong . tub too slippery which causes his head endlessly roll back forth into corners . slant tub also meant larger baby which causes his head dig into his chin which he hates . bathtime bonding , so after month half fighting , we ended up taking our baths together . my son prefered skin skin contact anyways . tub also poor fit any oval sink bathroom , one time i put it kitchen sink i filled it water it buckled . never tried it again . if you want wash your baby sink , get foam sponge or bath support specifically made newborns . even 12 dollars i would not buy this tub again . granted it might work some , but if you fussy or even mildly fussy baby i would not recommend this tub .	-1
first off , person who wrote her ingenious husband who invented trick squeezing air out before screwing top ? yeah , i'd call him creative , but not one who ' invented ' trick . i giggle myself then post this publicly ... myself my whole group friends used trick . secondly , liners too expensive , third , how world you mix formula these things ? they worked great breastmilk , but hassle mix formula seperate container then pour it into liners just too much me 3 am screaming kid . even waiting warm it up under hot running water took too long . give me regular bottles any day . ps- bisphenol-a ... what high fructose corn syrup , cargeenan ( which sludge comes soybean processing put nearly every food market preservative ) even - gasp- probability your kid might someday eat bug eaten off chemically-treated cornfield ! i'm all protecting your kids but you can't save them everything there much more harmful substances out there	-1
this product good idea however : 1 . fill hole , not large enough fill bottom dish hot tap water without getting water into serving tray . 2 . can't put micro . 3 . extremely hard open bottom compartment clean . 4 . extremely hard open close ( i my daughter use butter knife pry open ) . 5 . not good grandmother hands joint problems . 6 . doesn't keep food warm very long . perhaps going back drawing board would help this product	-1
i've used diaper dekor since birth my now 7-month-old daughter i loved it begin . very easy one-hand use -- step pedal , drop diaper through flap , very easy tie off bag when it became full . beginning , it handled odors well too ; even smelly diapers didn't cause problems . but soon i started feeding solid foods , things changed . it proved completely incapable containing ghastly stench those diapers . my daughter room top our stairs , stench didn't just fill room , it flowed out her door down stairwell , so we treated powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs . i took leaving her window open fan air out room during day emptying pail before bedtime night order prevent it stinking up house . lasted week -- i just bought new pail ( diaper genie 2 ) i hope works better	-1
after seeing latest consumer reports article infant car seats , i immediately replaced my britax companion graco snugfit . britax previously highly rated , but latest test trashed it . we surprised , becuase it first seat we owned ( our 3rd kid ) , really rock solid snug once installed . i bought graco snugfit , i nothing good say it . no matter how tight i got straps attached latch my 2006 honda odyssey , i could still flip seat up side side very little effort . now , i'm sticking britax	-1

i this when my daughter first born . it worked ok but she seemed pretty curled up it . when she 2 months old we out walking one buckles snapped -- luckily i my hand under sling she not fall out or anything . i able return product , but i bought snugli carrier instead -- i would not recommend this or any other sling plastic buckles .	-1
i three baby carriers . it seems eccessive but i never found one really doing it me . i started gracco carrier it turned out nightmare everytime i put baby inside . my son crying while i snapping all 1001 snaps it there but after he stopping crying even though he wasn't looking too confortable . when he got older ( 5 mounths ) we bought backpack carrier . this really really nice buy . we loved it so our son . problem it i wouldn't put baby younger than 5 mounths inside . so when my other son born we tried this new carrier . i think that best newborns because they don't support any body part . more over , when baby sleeps , he nice position they seem like it ( even though i though his head weird angle ?!?! ) soon baby gets heavier ( 8 or 9 lbs ) it getting bit uncomfortable mostly if you i large breast i . it slips its place so head child doesn't stand your shoulder anymore but your lower chest ( so when you large breast baby head really really weird angle ! ) . i think it doesn't worth price time you use it . now my younger son 5 mounths , i don't use it anymore	-1
i've bought this tub thinking i just fold it up store it under sink . but that not how it works . it take many steps fold unfold it , one them ivolves inflating seat ! mechanism snapping it place when it unfolded looks like it would break if it used couple times . also , plastic inflatable seat smells like all plastic inflatable things , probably not very pleasant little baby . i am returning this item	-1
we better luck than some - gate lasted 2 years before locking mechanism gave out . called customer service , they said it isn't replaceable part . too bad . it easy enough install , worked well up until it didn't anymore . click pretty loud ; we found ourselves trying close it two-handed avoid waking up baby . disappointed it didn't last long we needed gate - but my daughter only 2 1/2 i still need gate top stairs . i'l replacing it different product , obviously	-1
all other reviews , our gate worked well while then latch broke well . there no way fix it . company nothing help us situation , except suggest we buy whole new one . no thanks ! i would encourage anyone who purchased this gate send your complaints company , i am doing . though company says they made improvements product , gates still breaking should recalled . their representative told me there no reason recall gates since it not safety issue , however , they advertise its use top stairs ! i called first years , they said send your complaints : judy pauletterc2 first years100 technology center dr. suite 2astoughton , ma 02072	-1

we tried these after getting one portable mats didn't work out . this item too didn't work us . it won't stick it there table cloth . then 9 time out 10 when we would get it stuck our daughter would pull it up one hand ! it really ended up more trouble than it worth . we started carrying package cleaning wipes her bag ... we wipe down her part table really well let her it . 14 months she doesn't really make too much mess if she we just extra couple bucks tip apologize mess way out .	-1
my experience similar other reviewers . one movable positioner secures very loosely small piece velcro . my two week old daughter managed slide down positioners her face against one them when i checked her middle night . honestly , only way baby would stay this thing if they didn't move their arms ... so perhaps designers no children their own	-1

i registered this sling , thrilled when i received it shower gift . i couldn't wait use it . when my son 3 weeks old , i tried put him it . we both instantly hated it . its far too bulky use infant , it doesn't adjust small enough fit my frame ( i'm 5'6quot; far skinny ) . i kept it , thinking my son would eventually fit it , perhaps he got bigger i'd able wear it . wrong . i wish i'd brought it back when i could still return it . my son now 11 months old we still can't use this sling . there no way he sit it securely . he hates held but can't walk yet so i really hoping we could use this , but it still doesn't fit me , my 24 pound son isn't held safely it . he wiggle his way out less than 3 seconds . i'm expecting again , hoping i find something much better than this this baby	-1

got this my then newborn thought it life saver until she started soiling it months later then realized it isn't all easy get off . 8 snap straps , it hassle move crib away wall snap on/off regular basis . i realized changing crib sheet just easier . crib mattresses vinyl covered , why we need waterproof sheets anyway . i just slip off her fitted sheet wipe up any wetness off vinyl - so simple . sometimes good marketing convinces us we need useless products . way , two straps broke off wash , thank god it after i realized i didn't need this anyway	-1

i bought this play gym because i figured it baby einstein play gym it good ... plus reviews i read good . our local babiesr'us didn't displays playgyms so i no idea this gym would suck . i hate it !! my son only loves it cause i put other toys there . notice pictures people shared who state they love this play gym so their babies toys hanging playgyms aren't ones originally came gym . why buy extra toys ?? i paid $69 this gym ... it should come more toys . i tried return this gym tiny love comes lights , music lots toys but when i opened product original packaging got messed up i unable return or exchange . what waste money me . i received playgym my friend bought $20 my baby shower . only came 3 toys hung all these toys there my son loves too . my point you don't spend so much money playgym . your babies love anything long there lots look or if you going spend money find one lots toys so you dont ' buy extra toys .	-1
idea stroller great . however after purchasing using it , it isn't well equipped . there no cup holders , basket storage not easy get isn't even big enough hold diaper bag , let alone any bags when shopping . i also take it apart even fit it my trunk . need less say i don't even use it much b/c it too hard maneuver two kids . i wasted my money this . graco new one out looks so much better much equipped go moms like me . wish i would waited . it same price . wish i could exchanged it .	-1

i can't begin convey frustration i felt when trying use refill . i struggled 20 minutes trying slip too-tight bag over cartridge . diaper dekor works wonderfully single-use item , but $30-40 pop , it most expensive garbage outside ted kozolowski apartment . printed instructions clear -- it just they product not what it supposed	-1
i would recommend just buying one sits top toilet stepping stool . you don't clean #2 out cup you'll probably already stepping stool so your child reach sink . it really saves lot hastlemy mother-in-law i both bought this potty my daughter . ( one her house one mine . ) it hard me put together , my mo-in-law couldn't get it together all . it makes loud trumpet sound every time " water " passes sensor inside toilet scared my daughter terribly first , but luckily it took lot batteries work it died . other thing i'd like point out if your child actually likes noise batteries die , they almost impossible replace . order replace them you take almost whole toilet apart , which again very hard put back together . we got ours sale so i don't mind expenditure . when you buying these things just remember it only toilet they using year or so tops ...	-1
good thing , except spring , jumper pretty nice . unfortunately , spring most important part it not good . it low elasticity our baby not like it he push really hard get anything exciting out it . we gave it away free buy different one our new baby girl	-1
i unpacked this warmer which we received gift - not use one our first child . i got far filling removable reservoir water before i decided return it . you literally fill plastic reservoir water turn it upside down so lid reservoir , which slides , no rubber seal or other watertight implements , leak everywhere . judging other comments , i'm glad it leaked before i chance use it burn up box wipes .	-1
this wipes warmer replace one got broken our move . we use cloth wipes it burned few , smells moldy no matter what i clean it ( never happened any our other wipes warmers ) won't stay closed . it actually got so hot it melted ' moisture dispenser ' melted/burned little foamish piece it . then last night we refilled it one last time before we could head out today buy new different one leaked water all over changing table . get different warmer this one awful	-1
i bought this my baby who , 6 months barely 16 lbs . she didn't hit 20lb mark until she past 18 months old , so she rear facing long time . she loved kicking this but mirror never worked well , i could adjust it within day or two it all over i couldn't see my baby again . water seemed evaporate now just over year later hardly any water it . we can't find any leaks but there little water . little fish inside stuck together right away we could never get them back apart . sadly we just gave up it her first birthday . it never worked us mirror see her toy part , while it fun kick , just worthless . my sister law wanted one my niece but i am glad she saw how worthless mine before wasting her money this	-1
i bought these because they come foam inserts help collect leakage . i'm 38 dd use large flange my medela pump , so i too found sharp edge contacts breast cutting into my sore areola/nipple . ameda shells round edge much more comfortable , although leakage city ! my sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend ( great proper latch ! ) , treatment mild yeast infection . hope this helps	-1

this great gate if you strong , healthy back always two hands available . but how many people kids both those ! it great keeping my baby room , but my 4 year old couldn't open it neither could her grandma . it made me my husband want cuss . it back box return pile . don't waste your money .	-1
i bought this seat travel my toddler found it extremely annoying difficult use . tray stuck never loosened up difficult get my child out . also , it close impossible keep clean , unless you unstrapped it took it completely apart after every use . it very unwieldy travel . it folded up , but didn't stay together so not very portable . because it so cumbersome , it ended up getting dropped laminate floor promptly broke . cheap plastic its made shattered bottom corner where side seat fit , so now it garbage where it belongs . i only owned it five months used it barely three times month average . yes , it cheap , but they say , poor man buys everything twice , now i'm out fifteen dollars buy booster .	-1
exactly 3 months after i bought this stroller , bracket back holds bars together popped off , making it dangerous impossible use . luckily i bought extended warranty receive full refund ( in-store warranty expired just 3 days previously ) . when i tested stroller store , i thought it seemed very flimsy felt it wouldn't last long ( which why i bought warranty ) , but idea such great stroller why i decided take chance . pros stroller : very light , compact easy fold ; easy maneuver ; great tall people like me--don't hunch over reach handles . there some nice little things too , like ventilation back , headrest , cup-holder , reclining position . cons : only rated carrying children under 40 lbs each seat ( didn't know this when i purchased it) -- i 35 lb . 2 y.o. newborn , so we don't exceed limit there , but my 42 lb . 3 1/2 y.o. can't use it . canopy doesn't cover kids well shade ( only face -- that big deal when living southern az -- or if it raining) -- when seat reclined ( my newborn ) canopy doesn't even cover her head ( i clip blanket drape it over ) . my 2- y.o. practically too big it -- her head extends above top seat . finally , general construction stroller not sturdy . overall , this could great stroller , but it just not sturdy -- obviously not , it broke -- but one would expect brand name " jeep " it would built better . we only use it walks going out , no off-trail stuff -- we used it 10 times before it broke . my umbrella stroller i bought 6 years ago still going strong -- why can't they make this just well-built ? i would love this stroller if it just built better	-1

i used graco metrolite stroller , i really liked it . however , i gave it relative because it went infant travel system . i bought used jeep liberty stroller , thinking it would upgrade , boy i wrong . i simply list things i not like : 1 ) it quite bulky when folded , especially compared other strollers i've . 2 ) it heavy , awkward carry , there nowhere apparent grab it . handles ? i don't see any . 3 ) all 3 tires went flat . my local bike shop charged $30 replace them all ( your mileage may vary ) . 4 ) my daughter not interested steering wheel since battery previous owner left it corroded , sounds didn't work so i can't comment those . 5 ) it creaks when you push it . i'm not sure where sound coming but we oiled wheels it still creaks . 6 ) mp3 player , which " cool factor " only reason my husband prevented me getting rid stroller , these small speakers near baby head , so order really hear music if you're playing music you like , you turn it up . volume doesn't go very high . same money , you could probably buy some portable powered speakers clip them stroller .	-1
ok , this chair fine except two very important things . one : tray huge , not good way , really hard clean maneuver kind way . also , two trays fit top , dishwasher safe , too big fit dishwasher !!! so what point ??? two : it little thing separates legs tray , rather than chair ... making it impossible set down anywhere when it full food your baby yelling get out chair . everything else , chair great , but you find these other features just any other high chair . i'm bought one that made famous toy maker , love it	-1
this item misleading because it runs very small . i am pre-pregnancy size 6 i ordered s/m size based waistline ..... wrong ! i am my 35th week pregnancy this thing barely would fit around my lower abdomen . not only it run small , but it also fold wrinkles anytime i move so it not much help . if you shorter or petite , waistband very wide back ill-fitting ( not conform curve your spine ) . it definately made taller , longer-torso women ( aka 6 ft . models ) . i would go type support if given chance	-1
i am so disgusted i woke 5am black friday drive 12 miles walmart purchase dora toddler bed . i held dora toddler bed until christmas , when christmas eve i went put it together pieces package wrong i unable assemble bed all . i ended up returning bed , exchange fr nothing . i found out they no longer carry bed .	-1
my son , who used using wood stool ( 8 " tall slick wood feet ) fell climbing up this because top ( foot area ) too small it tipped him ! it only 6 " wide top . not much room clumsy toddlers turn around . if you push it toward toilet there nothing left child stand . if you leave it out , then it takes up more room arc design waste . getting down he also started fall because it such narrow top . his feet still dangled he sat toilet - not coming near top this 8 1/2 " tall stool . this advertised 10 " tall ( actually 8 1/2 " ) 14 " long ( correct , but top surface only 11 1/2 " ) 10 " wide ( also correct but again , it only 6 " wide top)the rubber feet great non-skid purposes , but that only positive thing i say this .	-1
i purchased this gate thinking would perfect high traffic area . i totally wrong !!! every time you walk through swing gate you readjust it , which makes impossible open close one hand . forget it if you get through hurry , ' cause it needs readjust open close it . plus gray bumper mine loose , so if i get top bracket fit correctly , bottom one lose not secure . i get my hands knees readjust it correctly so i close it , only go through same readjusting hassle few minutes . i would returned this gate , but i trashed box before i installed it	-1
i tried this my newborn i think this product unsafe not sturdy . base seat very wobbley , it would help suction cups bottom . you fill your tub half way order your child stay warm . also , when i put my baby seat he 12 lbs , seat tipped backwards . i imagine it would worse when my child heaviear moves around more . i not think this product safe . it would make great product if they included baby tub it . so i returned product ended up 4-in-1 bath station safety first worked well my first child	-1
i loved this item face value - it looks good , materials good quality , it feels secure , premise functionality bed what i wanted because i planned breastfeeding my newborn wanted her close . i proud my purchase showed it many my friends before baby came . well , " mattress " comes it so hard my baby won't sleep it . she won't nap it , when i put her down all she cry . i've tried everything get her sleep this thing because it would so helpful if she would , but she won't sleep it all . i've even tried making it softer putting blankets down board mattress covering this receiving blanket i tuck sides ( something i don't want because sids factor ) doesn't even help - it still too hard surface . now , my baby sleeping bed me i can't get any sleep because i'm afraid rolling over her or her rolling off bed . if they'd just make mattress more comfortable baby , this would perfect product i'd rate it 5 , but because it virtally useless me my baby due mattress/board , i rate it only 2 stars . i'm so let down this product	-1
i really unhappy this lock . it not only kept one year old opening lid but kept everyone else house opening it well	-1
i recently purchased this booster well britax starriser booster seat ( i two cars/two toddlers infant ) . my children argue over who gets ride starriser . some reason they not comfortable parkway . my theory it too much like car seat rather than booster -- they feel " too snug " it . they even look uncomfortable it . one advantage parkway over starriser increase neck protection if they should fall asleep . if i it over , i would purchased two starrisers instead parkway . btw , i purchased britax companion my infant i love it	-1
we purchased crib , armoire , dresser w/ tower it took 5 wks this shipped us . once we received it , we opened it only find each box contained 2-3 severely cracked pieces . after inspecting them , we found dmg wasn't caused packaging but , poor craftsmanship . most pieces assembled using nailgun some nails even bent . cracking stemmed areas nailed continued all way up piece furniture . co pre drilled holes used screws instead , this would've never happended . obviously it " cheaper " use nails instead screws . we took pictures dmgs i wish i could attach them this review so you'd able see yourself . there also several areas inside crib which weren't sanded properly would real hazard little fingers b/c splintering wood . it advertised constructed hardwoods , but all actuality it pine . when you think hardwood , you expect oak or birch , not softwood like pine . tops furniture drawer fronts only pieces solid wood . everything else particle board . some solid wood pieces weren't even 1 piece wood , but 3 they glued together . we're currently trying return this product full refund . we're also shopping last minute replacement furniture w/ only 2 wks left before my due date . i would never purchase peice furniture made this company again .	-1

i got these when my son 12 months old already strong little guy who enjoyed dumping his bowls food onto his high chair tray . trying outsmart him , i purchased these hoping keep some food bowl . much my disappointment , they only stick formica countertops well . littlest one doesn't even stick . none them stays my son plastic high chair tray more than second or tw o.o upside , lids secure once shut all way ( which take little work ) , so they make great storage on-the-go finger foods diaper bag ... i haven't one leak yet , i put things like applesauce them test them . not total waste money , now i found this alternate use . they wash well , without any noticeable breakdown plastic , top rack dishwasher	-1
i agree all other reviews saying warmer burn your hands overheat bottle . especially when you only few oz bottle . water warmer actually boil when it heats up if bottle got stuck handle , it means you use your bare hands separate boiled bottle boiled handle . you end up boiled hand well . worst part it burn your love one .... not only , cooler not close well so content not really kept fresh even ice-pack frozen before placing into cooler . we switched avent warmer . little more $$ but it much better . i would not recommend this product	-1

i bought this carseat ( different color ) because i liked features . however , everytime i put my now 5 week old seat his head plops forward . i tried everything , putting diaper or towel around his head because headrest sucks , trying push base down so it doesn't sit up so high . you know how nerve wrecking it driving just look back see you newborn head ploped forward so bad he choking . not good graco , this carseat could not tested before . i evenflo my previous child not this problem . i am truly disappointed . anyone could tell me how make this problem go away , i am all ears . i know seat right because balance window all blue . i talked other mothers they same problem . help !!!	-1

i'm very dissappointed this expensive pump . now i'm looking one . it difficult pump if you large nipples . you buy extra sheild which costs extra . it noisy . it loses suction . milk backs up tubing gets moldy . i clean parts everyday . i contacted medela few times troubleshoot pump they eventually sent me motor ( great customer service ) . it worked few months now same problem happening . i guess it works some not others . now i'm hunt pump since i want exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk her first year .	-1

1 ) like others here , my charges not last more than 5 hours . beeping parent unit wake you 3am every night ( unless you leave them charger ) . 2 ) both my parent units now ( after only two weeks minor useage ) refuse connect nursery unit , beeping endlessly . " cycling " them off per prescribed ( though not well detailed ) manufacturer trouble-shooting method nothing . only logical conclusion : nursery unit apparently died not sending out signal . also : while they working i not really get hype these units generated . my home very common 1800 square feet two-story " box " type arrangement . static would become unbearable once parent unit taken downstairs ( maybe due weak or faulty nursery unit get-go ) , signal would cut out before we even got kitchen . so we either got static or no signal less than 50 linear feet nursery . poorly designed ( operator interface , controls , directions trouble-shooting ) , poorly engineered ( poor reception , enormous static , fast battery drain ) poorly manufactured ( apparent faulty parts lack quality ) product	-1

due fact you can't give 0 stars , i choose 1 , otherwise it would big fat 0 !!! we bought this mattress when i pregnant , thinking all crib mattresses same we totally wrong . couple months ago my son poked couple holes vinyl when he should napping , mind you he nothing use other than his fingers , no toys , nothing sharp , etc . well last night he wakes up crying middle night , my husband i go see what matter , find vinyl split completely side side springs sticking out . my poor little one springs poking him . after further examination , we found under vinyl thin i stress word thin , layer foam , then cardboard piece then coils . what joke ! carboard !!!! needless say i went out today bought him much better , better constructed simmons mattress . i should note my son only 17 mths old , first five months his life he never even slept mattress , so bascially he only used it 12 mths . don't waste your money .... you'll only buy one down road . take your money buy much better well known mattress your baby !!! afterall they deserve just good nights sleep we !!! mom who learned hard way !	-1

i disappointed cup holders come off too easy , they button onto car seat it isn't strong enough so when my boys try stuff their juice or water them they snap right back off . no longer attached seats because i refuse keep putting them back . i guess this seat okay , it nice plush but downside getting backless seat ( which i didn't think before i purchased this ) fact kids can't fall asleep these seats . my kids like i am sure most kids when they go drive motion knocks them right out . but because there nothing support their head neck they slump over very uncomfortable so they usually don't fall asleep unless they just really beat then i worry because i don't want them get crook their neck . i say this seat very lightweight which big change coming regular child seat .	-1
i bought this because only way my 6 week old sleep bed me . i bought this try reduce risk sids since his sleeping my bed . unfortunately , he kept moving it causing his legs go off side sleeper . once his legs went off side , his upper body would roll which would cause his face almost right against side sleeper . course this concerned me so each time i woke up , i move him again . finally , after couple time doing this , i just took him out it . this second sleep positioner i bought both worthless !!!	-1

i agree several others it very difficult clean . there so many nooks crannies . i used it my daughter hated it then tried it again when i my son it no different . my son 16 months old learning feed himself there times i not want let him practice because i dread how long it takes me clean after each meal . i went out bought inexpensive highchair without all bells whistles it works great ! now i more time spend playing him instead cleaning highchair .	-1
walker few flaws . first all toy bar front table not ideal . it too close child only few inches away child head . my son keeps bumping his forhead toybar when he riding walker ..... constantly . seat too tight crotch area seat too high , it should roomier drop lower .	-1
i saw this i thought it would great . it would keep my daughter food off dirty table catch food she drops . it those things but it hard clean . it gets pretty dirty , catching pouch , there grooves make it hard wipe mess out . i used it twice never use it again . i recommend table toppers- they disposable mats you stick table throw away when you . they stay place better , you wrap them around edge table so baby not put mouth table . i use mats crumb catcher bib walmart catches her messes better this one . her lap says clean clean up lot easier . you not worry putting dirty mat back into your diaper bag .	-1
quot ; stickyquot ; pads supposed hold organizer don't even stick , so every morning i would wake up find organizer sitting pile floor next changing table ... this absolutely no items it . organizer doesn't come any information , so i no idea if there alternate ways hang organizer or not . this great idea , but it very poorly constructed .	-1
we loved monitor first . features nice price reasonable . then , without event or explanation , it died one day we haven't able recharge one handheld units . maybe we got dud	-1

my son 5 months old now first 4 months , monitor worked pretty well . we got bit static time time , but i would given it 4 stars . but ... one night i woke up reassure myself little green " " light saw monitor not . thinking it fluke , i turned it back , checked baby went bed . but , over course couple weeks , it became more more unreliable , turning off . it also hard turn it back . i flip switch several times before it would work . , this not battery issue , since it plugged entire time . i went evenflo website read faqs . there mention problem power light going out , but nothing monitor itself going out . needless say , we've thrown it away gotten different brand . i mentioned this my friend 8 month old other day she said same exact thing happened hers - just stopped working reliably . she bought different monitor too . both our new monitors working perfectly now less static . i wouldn't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes .	-1
i read all amazon reviews but still decided go avent sippy cup since i relatively good experiences avent bottles . unfortunately , leaking real problem these cups . not only milk seem pour out sides no matter how well i try fasten lid , but it not flow easily my son when he sips . he ends up mouth full milk . so much my efforts get him start using cup . i orginally used playtex he liked well enough . i only switched because playtex valve hard clean easy tear . now , after wasting money avent , i'll go back playtex hopefully my son willing give sippy cups try . i don't usually write amazon reviews but i figured it worth it this case save someone else trouble . unless you want milk everywhere , i would definitely avoid these cups .	-1
i am so disappointed avent product just no good . short term or long term these cups not worth anything since they leak . my son cups leaked him , floor , his diaper bag car . i don't understand why anyone if they say they leaked would give this product anything but 1 star . mom enough too --- running around cleaning after leaky , unreliable products not fun especially price avent magic cup .	-1
screws come brackets so soft they strip almost immediately --- use my own , then read review below decided i'd better off just screwing furniture into wall . .	-1
i am unhappy this product . my newborn baby 22 " long weighs 7 pounds . i purchased this item after speaking rep size . i've found my son easily get his legs out bottom pouch through opening . i think if there longer strip velcro instead short square , this would prevented . he also get his arms out top . if velcro strip could larger , going more toward back side product , this would not happen . maybe my son more narrow top than some children this not problem many , but i think this would make product more useable , one size fits all . also , he long , small size too cramped . i'm assuming next size up would too wide him therefore making it impossible his arms stay inside - which happening anyway . i like product idea fabric construction , ( which why i gave it 2 stars ) but this product not work me . i recently purchased first years swaddle blanket , but issues one well . i am currently searching one fit .	-1
( 2 stars because style cool ... ) this christmas gift my husband this year our son big boy ( 19 1/2 lbs @ 4 months)and it too much carry him , his carrier heavy diaper bag everyday daycare so this seemed like perfect solution ... it ... until bag started coming apart 7 days after i received it ! i careful , i read some other reviews stitches coming apart i thought they just over filled bag ... nope ! bottle holder ripped all way down side ... you can't overfill ... there just room one bottle , isn't what it made ??? my husband really loved this bag because it wasn't ' girly or babyish ' but put $$ something hold bottle !	-1

i purchased peg perego aria stroller last month my 3rd son . needless say , i lots experience stroller world . this my first peg perego stroller purchase i used graco maclaren past . i using my maclaren umbrella stroller ( which i purchased 2000 when my first son 6 months old ) thought i would buy new stroller since other bit old . my girlfriend recommended aria so i purchased it . anyways , it huge disappointment . steering awful . you definately need two hands this stroller . stroller also extrememly " wobbly " . i shocked i figured such " upscale " brand would quality enough not wobble so much . 5 point restraint hard stay place back straps attached into little " envelope " type holder but it always comes out there no device actually secure it place . it bulky it doesn't fold into small compact stroller . i used this 3 times just gave it away ... what waste $$ . i'm back using my maclaren , which looks thrashed but wonderful stroller . i could kick myself wasting money . my advice you test it out before you buy it!!!(don't rely name	-1

first , i agree other reviewers who say this helps their baby sleep better . i cannot deny . our two+ week old little girl seems love it seems sleep longer stretches it without waking . however , trade off better sleep not worth risk . i woke up last night find she slipped down her face right bolsters . she could easily suffocated ! this very common complaint this product ( both here amazon web site well target web site where there many parents who reporting same scary moment i ) . some reviews seem say if you real squirmy older baby true problem this product . i tell you not quite case . our little two week old tightly swaddled night doesn't move whole lot - yet she slipped down position where she could suffocated . bolsters very tight her sides so doesn't explain things either . if you choose purchase this product , please very careful it . i understand those you who infant reflux don't really choice this but i recommend you try it first daytime your infant closely supervised so you see if they likely slip down . us , we may try keep using it elevating bottom little blanket underneath but we absolutely getting rid bolsters .	-1

even though i think this very good idea ( no mess clean up like there roaming stand-alone potty ) , ring doesn't fit our toilet seats well . we oblong seats , not round ones , ring slides back forth , especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries get up it . it doesn't make her feel very stable so , so far least , she refused use it	-1

this mirror really isn't worth money . you'd better off just buying plain mirror baby look you look baby , that all this thing . remote control pointed directly mirror , kinda hard driving down road . also , music isn't very loud , atleast not loud enough get baby attention when upset , which what i hoping . lights aren't very bright . really can't see they even light up unless it very dark out . also , positioner works fairly well when baby facing backwards , but once you turn baby around attach mirror back front seat , it doesn't stay place well . you could spend alot less money just plain baby -in-sight mirror	-1

our daughter turning 2 years old this week i felt it time finally write review this amazing product . very beginning , she incredibly alert interested baby . she born c-section 38 weeks eyes hands wide open . once they finished cleaning her up , my husband i thrilled just cuddle her talk her while she looked us both wide eyes made little coo coo sounds . right away she great nursing very good latch . she rarely ever cried , when she , it quiet little " lay lay lay " sound , not wild waa-waa . throughout infancy she always capable adapting every situation quickly without emotional outburst . where it would seem other children would over-stimulated environment , she would thrive seem want more stimulation ! only three months age , people thought she older because her alertness interest people animals . she hit every developmental milestone months early , especially language ( sign speech ) , music appreciation , colors/shape/letter/number recognition . her pediatrician happily surprised her suggested i should five more just like her ! when we bought babyplus , we thought , " if it helps only 10% well testimonials say it , it worth it " . we're certain it contributed positively helping develop this little miracle ours . we're now expecting child #2 ( 25 weeks ) although not using baby plus could interesting experiment ( same gene pool , same parenting , etc . ) , we're too interested possibilities how much it may contribute our next child us withhold it .	1

i liked this positioner because it came adjustable head piece . my baby kept wiggling up top headboard this piece kept him doing so . i also liked fact my baby grew wider i could adjust wedges . one more thing this comes mat . this saved me changing sheet because he puked up so much . i bought two would flipp flopp them when he would get sick	1
i used one these 24 inch extensions cover 90 inch space . kidco configure gate contains three 24 inch pieces ( i.e. 72 inches total ) , so if you need extra length , you purchase 8 or 24 inch extensions customize your gate any length . extension easy use very sturdy . gate looks uniformed you cannot tell it several separate pieces . only ' issue ' you connect extensions either section w/the door ( i.e. 24 inch section open/close swing door ) or use it end piece . i not able continously connect extensions one ( not sure if i this incorrectly or not . ) but nonetheless , extension worked fine i love my new gate	1
my 14-month old daughter loves these snack cups . she monitor her snack time , eating much or little she needs . she loves carrying around snack cup one hand sippy cup other . only reason i give it 4 stars , because she tendency keeping her hand flaps while walking around . this makes single cheerios fall out here there . but , nothing compared giving her snacks open bowl . i've only used them cheerios so i can't comment other snacks ( she tends choke goldfish so she only gets those while sitting high chair ) . she hasn't tried taking off lid like other reviewers , so that not problem us ( least not yet ) . we use them all time i definitely recommend them	-1
these slings essential part parents . both my husband i use new native slings daily basis . we've ' wearing ' our daughter since day one continue now she three months . this helped me tremendously getting ' know ' my baby . it allows me responsive immediately her needs because i read her cues before she gets full blown cry . it helps me accomplish tasks around house makes shopping/running errands easy . we not even own detachable infant carseats . i cannot imagine lug one those things around ! i feel like this helped her transition her womb environment outside world . it gives her sense security even new situations . unlike front facing carriers , she turn her head into our chests if she feels insecure or overstimulated . there endless benefits ' wearing ' your baby i feel like this sling made it incredibly easy me my husband so . there no buckles or rings or fasteners , just slide it . if first you don't succeed , try again later . it may more comfortable you baby different stage . tip , get moving ! motion what soothes babies brings them comfort . again , baby wearing such wonderful thing . i suggest you read up benefits find sling/carrier works well you . we recommend this one all new parents never anyone complain	1
my baby loves it . way it bigger than it looks picture . i afraid it would too small my 12lb baby but it fits her perfect .	1
what lifesaver this pillow my 2 month old daughter . when my son wants me play game , puzzle or play floor . i just lay her pillow so she watch us feel apart our play time . i also found it helpful when i fold laundry . i lay her down right beside me she watch what i am doing . it props baby head up just enough -- better than just laying flat floor . lounger also cradles baby . i wish i found this when my son baby . i recomend this lounger every new mommy .	1
i got this tray my son daily rides car , it terrific ! he eat it , put his sippy cup into cup holder , totally independent . he also play it - cars , crayons , etc ., it holds his books too . after approximately 9 months constant use , it cracked . ( it very stiff , course , but i don't recall anything significant happening it when it cracked ) . worth money far i am concerned .	-1
this awfully cute bedding set i'm very pleased it . it arrived quickly , good quality , though fitted sheet little thin , it still good backup .	-1
i bought this upon recommendation my lactation consultant , so far i've very pleased . i wanted few bottles breastmilk available so my husband could feed our baby when i'm out running errands . there just few parts , so assembly , disassembly cleaning very easy . but best part pump , you buy different-sized breastshields use it . i needed larger one than what came standard it . it makes pumping more comfortable . first few times i used it , i considered switching electric pump because i wasn't pumping much milk . but more i pumped , more milk i produced . this breastpump worth every penny . i recommend it anyone who primarly breastfeeds , but wants option able someone else occasionally feed baby .	1
i bought this swing our first child specially because it many features ..... overall i am happy it our son seems enjoy it .... but few things i wish it .... one seat could reclined two toys made some kind noise get attention . overall price it good	-1
my daughter most happy when she her halo . i love these sleep blankets , cotton ones use florida weather just perfect then colder months toasty warm fleece . i wish they would come longer size since she outgrew them height well before weight limits . i recommend them anyone who wants good night sleep , your baby always just warm enough not warm these fantastic sleepers	1
this great organizer . i read other reviews bit skeptical until i received this one . it great ! we use avent bottles they , all their parts , fit very well . there even hooks bottom so hang items such pacifiers . it take little while figure out how make it not leak water counter , but once we mastered , all well	-1
my first son race car bed which wasn't made very well . we moved him big bed when our second child ready toddler bed . well , we decided get rid old car bed get him his own thomas bed his 2nd birthday since he obsessed thomas . best decision ever ! it so much better made other plastic beds ! i'm so glad i read reviews ... springs crib fits perfectly thomas bed ( it pretty strong because i lay bed him night if i ) . it really worth money . if you looking into cute toddler bed boy , i'd skip other cute beds go straight this one ! we all love it	1
i bought this seat because we small eating area our kitchen , too small full-size high chair . seat worked wonderfully age 5 months now age 21 months . i find seat hard recline or sit up but i only handful times once you find right setting your child it stays there until he/she ready next setting . cloth lining very easy remove , wash , put back plastic under seat cover easy wipe clean . tray easy put , remove again wipe clean or wash off sink . i also found seat easy take off dining chair when i need chair entertaining others . my daughter never complained sitting seat , now we no longer using tray but still using seat booster , enjoys her own place table . i highly recommend this seat parents looking conserve space their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort .	-1
i ordered this shade hoping it would cover all my baby when we're out strolling sun . it pretty good job ; only my son feet ankles exposed when he reclined ( my only beef product ) , but i cover his little piggies ankles sunscreen or shoes no problem . i like fact shade protects uv rays easily adjustable . i leave it my stroller all time still fold up stroller it attached . i think side pouches excellent plus . i am very pleased this product recommend it my friends family	-1

we just started potty train my 2 year old little girl when trip disney world came . honest i didn't know what because she wouldn't go potty big potty . i felt like we going take whole week off potty training her . full week disney world not going fun carrying potty seat around . then i found this babies us !!! what little blessing little ones . it fits perfect any potty she go without afraid potty . plus it fit perfect my wendy bellissimo diaper bag . i carry it everywhere !! i don't leave home without it . thanks such wonderful product helped make our first trip disney world so much better !!	1
my two year old son , loves this talking phone he carries thing everywhere . we love time quailty he spends playing this wonderful toy	1
diaper genie stage 2 refills helped us eliminate odors our twins room . easy install discard . our one year old twins use lot diapers they eating solid foods 6 months . but you install them tightly diaper genie . if refill wabbles its place , then you need see what wrong before starting using it . otherwise odors come out . real fact it works !!. you know , its great home my twins their room everything tidy . we used throw diapers bathroom garbage , but after few hours we couldn't stand going there . note : i am father , just spend couple hours day them ... my wife could tell you more how she loves this diaper genie	1
we received original co-sleeper gift . we also considered getting mini co-sleeper pack'n'play or similar playard . main advantage co-sleeper you attach it your bed so you reach your baby without getting up . original co-sleeper also used playard . playard capacity up 50 pounds , most brands only rated 30 lb . similarly bassinet level rating 30 lb . most brands go 15 . co-sleeper itself 2 or 3 pounds heavier than typical playard . width 28 " so co-sleeper go through our 29 " doorways without collapsing , unlike several playards around 31 " . there trick collapsing top bars - you pull bar upwards when you press buttons , then it easy . ( otherwise you push until your thumbs purple nothing happens ) this explained their website should included manual . i lot reservations after reading other reviews here but am glad i chose keep co-sleeper expect it use it constantly . also , arm reach canopy really strong beautiful i'm confident it'll keep cats out	1
i think this great quality product , i love idea it . however , i find my son whose 7 weeks old just not comfortable it . it not very soft it just so big him right now . i get him sleep it only if he completely zonked out beforehand . i think mini co-sleeper might worked better us beginning . original might better he gets older use play pen part it . i add directions somewhat difficult understand without going over them many , many times	-1
i replaced our old ocean wonders aquarium soother this rainforest waterfall version month half ago . aquarium still working our baby liked lights music , but i looking something would play longer period time . aquarium , i go her room press button couple times before she would fall back asleep . not fun 3 or 4 morning when all i want fall back asleep . i read waterfall soother plays up 18 minutes , so i thought i'd check it ou t.t he soother 3 different length settings : lights , music/sounds , movement 6 minutes ; lights music/sounds 12 minutes ; music/sounds only 18 minutes . there 3 settings sounds : rainforest sounds without music ; rainforest sounds lullabies ; rainforest sounds classical music . there 3 volume settings well . i ours set 12 minutes sounds lullabies i rarely go back her room press button second time . she almost instantly settles down once music starts . if i happen put her down nap or bed while she still awake , she'll quietly watch lights fall asleep her own . i'll admit hearing songs rainforest noises over baby monitor soothing relaxing i try fall back asleep . my only complaint lights seem really bright something supposed lull baby sleep . i ended up covering ours light flannel blanket dull light bit . baby can't see critters , but since i don't them set move , it not really big deal . despite bright lights , we're happy this soother	1
my son tiny- born 5lbs 6oz very much preemie . i simply cannot imagine putting him infant seat without this . it keeps his entire body place- not just his head . it provides great support soft white fuzzy side very warm ( we havnt used other side yet . ) my only complaint its bit akward get shoulder straps correct place around baby- but thats mostly because our baby still very tiny . once he ;s bigger we move headpiece up it shouldnt problem	-1
this carseat good value . pad bottom seat secures my 4 month old quite well removable well head pillow . i add infant head support her neck but that expected 4 month old . it reclines far enough her head doesn't fall forward it so simple adjust straps . overall very nice carseat money i spent .	-1
we purchased fisher-price open top take-along swing few months ago our daughter , very pleased its quality performance . we haven't any problems operation swing , even our little one grown her present weight 18+ lbs . it runs batteries , which us seem last almost month moderate use . this swing several great features . it folds up very easily really portable claimed . it pops right trunk trips grandma house , i've also used it quite bit backyard when i want yard work . 5 year-old house , i also appreciate able quickly carry it room room . only flat 5 foot tall short ( admittedly weak ) arms , i lot difficulty carrying swing baby it , but swing lightweight enough carry one-handed while baby other arm . though i'm pleased this swing , i'd really recommend it * addition * traditional baby swing rather than instead one . compact nature this swing means rocking motion very fast-moving , unlike slow , soothing motion taller swings . my daughter seems like take-along swing just fine when she alert , awake mood . when she tired , however , it just goes too quickly , even lowest setting , seems overstimulate her rather than calm her down . i'd originally purchased this idea replacing our full-sized graco swing , but we've ended up keeping both around they seem fill different needs . overall , i'd certainly recommend this swing - but if you're only going one swing your house , you might consider whether you'd more grateful big swing rocks your baby sleep , or this little one entertains during those fussy , bouncy times	-1
love these . i use them everywhere . i really can't imagine not them , since my son throws down all plates napkins still .	1
we really enjoy this travel system . car seat fits into both base stroller allowed us leave our sleeping daughter undisturbed when moving her in/out car . off work 3 months , i didn't feel cooped home when i could easily take my daughter store or park . big stroller compared umbrella strollers , we still prefer take it , because diaper bag other items fit easily underneath , seat-back folds down ( allowing sleep or diaper changes ) , it three cupholders , 2 side pockets hold other items ( burp cloth , bottled water , toys ) , little compartment sunglasses or cell phone . basket underneath accessible hands-free pressing up or down basket your foot . stroller fits trunk our compact saturn 4-door , or if necessary , front passenger seat ( upside-down fit wide wheels , which anyway relatively easy remove ) . loaded stroller easy guide one hand , so i push it if i happen carrying my daughter . stroller sturdy smooth enough take down street , paved park paths , we always use it packed sand beach ( it even works over brief path over unpacked sand , if you go backwards ) . her car seat stroller , she could get complete protection sun light rain two canopies , although i found draped blanket allowed more air flow . we took whole system 10-day trip , which included flight out town , i felt like our load lighter than those we took before our daughter born . 6 months , she just outgrown car seat ( but she basically off-the-charts her height/weight ) , but we still use stroller now she sit up . drawbacks , all fairly minor : not easy close stroller one-handed . wheels wider than carriage appears top , so i'm always banging wheels something . it takes few minutes remove/replace washable carseat cover , but this probably necessary due straps . any carseat , we would suggest getting help certified people proper installation carseeat your car ; we many questions installation , particularly since our car lacked latch system . we purchased second base so we didn't remove one our car our trip or our babysitter car	1
i think this great stroller traveling . i 4 year old she loved riding it . we used it our vacation disney world it wonderful all walking we . it fit tight spaces very easy manuever . it light weight easy use . overall i am glad i this great strolle	1
i actually got snug tub deluxe . this version comes inflatable rings baby stack inflatable post . it also attached inflatable fish wheezes when you squeeze it . i used it first time tonight my 6 month old baby enjoyed freedom splash play . my only caution use something keep baby slipping . i put her baby sponge underneath her elevate her propr her up . this also good lean her back wash her hair keep her slipping . i'm glad i bought this instead eurobath	1
i used this system 9 weeks now . bottle leak if you not tighten ring enough or correctly - i test shake before i feed if its wrong i unscrew reseat nipple . my daughter less gas these bottles than playtex bottles i tried . if your child gags one reviewer commented you need slower nipple . i use standard nipples not adjustable flow nipples . i adapter system allows me pump into bottle i like convenience able cap bottle when refrigerator it until feeding time . these bottles well dishwasher clean up easily	1
i am pretty picky shopper , but i fallen love this product . my now 6 1/2 month old daughter terrible reflux this only place i could ever get her sleep comfortably . she still sleeps it ( 18 pounds , it still safe up 25 or when they crawl out ) . there cushion newborns it removable use older babies . save money you'd spend co-sleeper , swing or bassinet try this instead . i buy it every baby shower i attend .	1
this product helps my colicky baby sleep through night , especially since she can't kick off blankets . i highly recommend it . sizing different than baby us . i'm probably going some exchanges so thought i'd provide info . x-small ( newborn ) 5 10 lbssmall ( up 6 months ) 10 18 lbsmedium ( 6-12 months ) 16 24 lbslarge ( 12-18 months ) 22 28 lbsx-large ( 18-24 months ) 26 36 lb	1
would someone able give me dimensions/measurements this mattress ? thanks so much ! i not this-however it made me put rating order post question ...	1
i would like ditto ( thank ! ) reviewer who suggested cvs brand covers . after reading her review , i purchased covers cvs.com . then i thought checking walgreen , sure enough , they carry them ( same price cvs , 40 $5.99 ) . i just picked up box today . so i soon bunch covers , but i don't care . i just love this thermometer . i actually one light it . outstanding product	1
i love plug-in feature , there many times i've left swing ( rush change diaper left it ) . true , it stop if lightly touched or blanket falls . swing isn't incredibly fast , but my 2 month old , it worked well . there two volume levels music , but i've only used lowest setting .	-1
love this tub . hammock attachment works well small infants	1
this one best market . looks good holds tons toys 2 drawers bottom really nice holding books . " must buy "	1
this toy favorite my 10 month old . he likes crinckle fin mirror . he also loves music , which calms him down when he crying . music soothing doesn't grate our nerves even though we've heard it many times . my only complaints there just two short tunes play alternatively you press his belly fairly hard each time you want one play . it would nice if there setting them play few or more times . there pictures words one fin useless there fit einstein theme . all all , good product i would buy again . way , thing he wearing his head diving mask snorkle	-1
i using two gates last year keep my 2 year old off stairs . gates attached walls . i not any problems either gate . those you searching gate dog , gate works 70 pound boxer .	1
i replaced my baby old bumper this one when she became mobile . it works fairly well keeping her getting her arms or legs caught crib slats . only complaint i " short " section bumper pushed down quite easily baby , thus defeating purpose keeping arms/legs inside crib	-1
this seatsaver one few wide enough tall enough suvs . contrast one other reviews ( i am not affiliated seat manufacturer ) , this seat job adequately , one should not post poor rating without researching specs , measurements , fit , etc ., imho . there no quot ; universalquot ; seat saver or , matter , car seat , fit every car . this one manages catch most itty-bitty things kids manage somehow accumulate sturdy enough car seat not make indentations actual seat , hence , serves its purpose well	-1
if you're going get baby bjorn potty chair , you've got get matching stool ! i love how stool rubbery-grip top prevent slipping . my son also uses stool read his books while sitting his matching potty chair . you've gotta get one now	1
my sister small one bedroon apt this product perfect	-1
i bought this backpack after reading several other reviews i am glad i ! i some shopping around local stores all other backpacks i found either much more expensive or same price but fewer features . my 7 month old daughter loves this backpack . addition , we don't need diaper bag because it so many pockets . i not any trouble putting sun visor backpack very easy store use . i originally bought this backpack take abroad place stroller but i see it going handy places like zoo grocery shopping well . i don't know how it would serious campers , but every day use it great .	1
these wonderful ! my baby getting uncomfortable swaddled three months , so we decided make switch sleep sacks . we worried her arms free she might hard time falling and/or staying asleep . this true first so we started only putting her these during daytime - light cotton one . after week she not waking early her naps anymore after two weeks we tried her it night - she slept straight through night ( she when she swaddled ) . so transition painless she seemed much happier baby able reach her hands move her arms . while i didn't notice shrinkage i notice zipper bunch up bit , but this hasn't problem . sometimes my daughter sucks it if it gets close her mouth , but she reach it - it doesn't cover her face all or trap air she could rebreathe . i didn't like these don't sleeves so i tried carter sleep sacks found sleeves too short hard get my daughter . those sacks only come one size which my daughter already outgrown four months ( 14 lbs , 24 inches ) . she also outgrown small size sleep sack , but medium size fits her perfectly some room grow . i didn't want use fleece first since it polyester . i wanted use cotton . but we've found she sleeps longer seems prefer he heavier fabric fleece one . also , we only bought these blue even though we girl because color calming our easily overstimulated baby . we've washed these many times they look just good hold together just well they originally . we've also found you put your baby into next larger size without it so big they get their arms out or it bunches up around their face . so after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks day one	1
my daughter recently her second child , spends alot time breastfeeding . this product allows her pump her convenience . she others hold feed baby while she spends some time her other child . product works very well . she said it takes little bit experimenting adjusting get it set work best her , but it excellent product . she previously less expensive product manufacturer , heard how good medela brand friend . this brand pleasure work after using less productive , noisier pump she before . we would highly recommend this product , product well worth price paid	-1
i got this pump hand-me-down my friend . it worked great even after many years ... i eventually purchased pump style advanced limited edition where pump separated bag . it takes up less desk space ( no extra space required bag ) . also , it more portable if all you need pump . i pump all over house ( study , bedroom , living room while watching tv my husband ) . just note some people problems getting milk out medelas ... it may not pump itself but size flanges . every woman breast nipples different sizes . initially , i using standard 24mm flanges ( suction cup things go over your breasts ) . it painful pump my milk would not come out even though i engorged plenty milk . it would take me 2 hours just get 2 oz milk ! i went see lactation consultant who suggested i try next size up flanges ( 27mm ) . she got me one try it made world difference . i could immediately pump 2oz under 5 mins . now , i pump daily stock up get 4 oz both breasts under 10 mins ( estimate since i don't really time it cause it so fast ) . i am now planning pump donate my milk milk bank . this pump made world difference . i think medela makes flanges 3 different sizes . standard 24mm comes all their pumps , 27mm 30mm .	1
this sleepsack keeps our little bundle warm toasty those cold san francisco nights . it really easy use move carset stroller . i wish it zipped up just little higher sides , but it best thing around we've seen .	1
i love how wide they . this makes them much easier clean handle . since they shorter i fit them short shelves my fridge when i use stopper caps them . i also fit them my milk cooler my breast pump because they short . my baby able hold them ease since they wider than other bottles . her arms don't stretch far . i haven't any real problems these bottles . i weary use them after friend complained leaking problem . i went ahead them because my sisters said they didn't any problems them . they leaked twice but only because i didn't screw lid all way because my hands wet . any bottle leak if you don't screw lid sufficiently . i used plenty other brands worse leaking issues when i watched my twin cousins . we tried three different brands weren't ever really happy any them	1
i two kids use my evenflo carseat . i hated it . it like they never even tried it out see how well its features worked . i finally got so sick it when my 2nd child 4 months old i ordered babytrend flexloc . first i seduced high safety ratings , but even after consumer reports article rescinded , i still liked lot features . pros : -very comfy seat , good padding -the canopy twice long my evenflo so it cover baby almost completely- canopy stays place ; it doesn't fall forward or backward behind seat- tightening mechanism under baby feet easy reach very easy adjust make straps tighter or looser depending what baby wearing- harness mechanism very easy adjust ( shoulder strap height ) . my evenflo rethreaded every few months even my mechanically inclined husband said it horrible . flexloc just dial back you turn--it breeze . - seat transfered cars without base . it strapped directly car using seat belt car seat or using latch system if your car it . - triangular handle nice grip easy hold any position- this carseat lighter than my evenflo- cloth very wipeable , not absorbant spills stains my evenflocons : i found few minor cons definitely would not deter me buying this carseat , one might ( depending how i resolve it once i contact babytrend ) . - release button take seat off its base toes under seat . it little harder reach than ones behind head if carseat backward facing . - others said , buttons move handle bit stiff , but not horribly so . i prepared them way worse . - handle thinner doesn't feel sturdy my evenflo when carrying baby around , but it hasn't any problems-this one big one i check babytrend : twice when i turned corner sharply , carseat tipped 45 degree angle ! i tightened down seatbelt much i could , putting my full weight it using seatbelt retracting mechanism . but maybe i'm still not doing it right . base narrower than my evenflo , so maybe that why ? so i need contact babytrend see if they any suggestions . until then , i guess i'll take corners slower ! overall , i felt like this seat major improvement over my evenflo even over graco snugrides i checked out store . it intelligently designed easy use adjust baby grows . i would recommend it sure . just make sure you strap it tightly or use latch system if you it	-1
i read some other reviews poor , but i disagree . my son loves this toy . he smiles when he sees turtle across his room . it plays music continually 12 minutes . so , middle night when he wakes up , i turn it he asleep time it runs out . we moved it twice straps seemed sturdy . however , it recommended this toy removed when child 5 months old or able get hands knees . this completely contradicts interactive play mode , since baby needs both physically mentally developed stage beyond 5 months reach all buttons .	-1
this thin sheet but it fits my full-size pack play bassinet perfectly . i would recommend getting 2 them because my son wets through it often	-1
i never seen any inflatable tubs quite like this we so pleased ! our 8 month old daughter loves independence she her own tub we feel she much safer than big tub this age . we love how you hang it up shower wall dry . just make sure suction cup wet it won't fall off wall . sizewize , it basically perfect fit our tub , which slightly tapered head toe , but i could see how it would snug if you small rectangular tub .	1
love it ! fits pad beautifully seems get softer everytime you wash it	1
i bought this beacause i needed my gate just little bit wider . it attached very easily easy install . also , it very hard find stores	1
i thought fold-up tub great idea , but we've used this only maybe 10 times before my daughter turned 6 months , maximum age use . i paid only $10 , so not much loss . she objected first time we tried it , 2 weeks , so we went back sponge baths while . i would suggest gradually introducing your baby tub . toys helped distract her when she little older . my daughter seemed too big it even 3 months , though she always 97%+ height weight . wash her backside , you course take her out tub . i usually forgot plug it before filling it , so usually water all over floor . instructions say tub supposed supported sink ; it certainly doesn't fit our oval bath sink . maybe it would fit 2-part kitchen sink . folding feature make it easy store our closet shelf . little tub bath , i liked it . it good quick bath or really soak her , but end i prefered unhurried sponge bath waterproof pad bed , which i think got my daughter cleaner	-1
well , i felt little silly paying $20 ( shipping ) 2 pieces plastic , 2 bra hooks , some rubber bands . however , kit work , allow you pump hands free . one word caution - if you use medela quick clean steam bags clean your pump parts , take hands free plastic sleeves off before throwing bag microwave ! otherwise , they warp don't fit right	-1
i bought same brand , but maybe newer/older version this ? it didn't book or decogestant only older children others mentioned . however , it infant tylenol equivelent , which we lucky enough not try ye t.t he gas drops fantastic - thank goodness we these , especially when we change his formula !! anytime our son " fussy no reason " we tried these drops first it stopped fussiness almost every time . saline drops great nose drops really helped during his colds . aspirator works fine , i've never tried different one , so can't compare . he didn't care teething toy , doesn't care taste teething gel , but it seems work . it also two cooling wipes which we haven't use ( no fevers yet ! ) . overall i really glad this , all these things together nice case i slid right under his changing table - no need hunt things middle night . i'd recommend this all new moms	-1
i wish it would zip up all way ... top coming down all time i adjusted . maybe it better two up age child .	-1
my wife i ( yep guy reviewing kids toy ! ) bought this present our 7 month old niece . she absolutely hooked it . relatively short attention span most toys , it rewarding see how much she likes it how long it entertains her . just squeezing musical tentacles her keeps her happy ! big doe eyes her mesmerized well . when she gets bored , learning play tunes keeps adults happy !! playing easy , you get two color coded tunes label help musical friend we know lot more now . my wife 4 months pregnant , we ordered already . only reason 4 stars one we bought trouble playing lowest note ( red tentacle ! )	1
i told get diaper genie many people but liked looks reviews diaper dekor so decided put it my registry . i am so glad i . i only empty it every 6-7days it simple odor free . even when full there no odor ! i didnt need put refill 3months . refills look pricey till you realize how long each one lasts . comparison , its cheaper ! i would recommend this anyone	1
i got this toy when my baby 7 months old , he now 8 1/2 months old . we've used it lots local driving roundtrip los angeles phoenix ( 7+ hours each way ) . it doesn't work miracles , but it definitely help calm distract my baby when he starts fuss , 70%-80% time . i think it more effective now than it when we first got it , maybe because baby started look forward it . it might help i * only * use it when he starts fuss . i haven't any problems toy working , volume dial nice feature . it its shortcomings , though , like some other reviewers pointed out : it only stays 15 minutes ( presumably save batteries ) so pretty much every time i put baby his carseat , i push button turn it , just case we need it during drive . it sometimes moves out place which affect able see baby mirror , but it still works distract him . it plays 5 or 6 songs random order , but they all extremely short , so it ends up very repetitive . overall , i think it useful tool calming baby during car trips , when it doesn't work it generally because my baby so tired or hungry i don't think anything would really help except getting him out car . even though repetitive songs get annoying , it far better than hearing baby screaming while everyone trapped car together	-1
i just bought these my daughter looks adorable . first time i put them she got little fussy until she realized she could see through them . shades come two straps , one small one large . my daughter four months old smaller strap barely fits but larger one still little big . velcro either side smaller strap just barely attached fits comfortably only if around bottom her head . this position , her ears little pushed down but strap soft it not big deal . if straight around her head , shades too tight squish area around her eyes . even if adjusted small possible , large strap still little too big . it should fit month i think .	-1
this our third baby monitor . first two static if you would plug anything into same outlet or get them near other electronic devices . this one worked flawlessly our home w/ zero static . talkback feature also wonderful three year old ( " go back sleep , " " i'll get you juice morning , " etc . ) not get up go child room real feature . only reason i gave it four stars because it only two channels because signals aren't encrypted . anyone else fm receiver pick up your conversations , but most monitors this way . we took monitor friend house it picked up lot static/interference something house ( video monitor , tv , i don't know . ) since it only two channels , we not able find clear channel . overall thoughts : best monitor i've ( stay away fisherprice models ) . i would buy again unless i apartment complex ( i wouldn't want other people listening ) , i would prepared take it back if i needed more channels	-1

i used this pillow last 2 months , 2 go . i like shape pillow , i just wished it little longer . i trying use king size pillow cuddle , but it too big hard turn . this pillow makes it easy keep next you turn over . i would just like it longer so i little end my legs , rest up higher so i cuddle it . when my legs ( which helps ) rest pillow only around my stomach i wish it came up my breast area so my arms could cuddle around it little easier . i would still give one pregnant friend it nice sleep . beware , my husband calls this " sperm pillow " , but if you get past , it nice pillow .	-1
this third potty i've purchased my son . first one made parents , it tipped over first time my son sat it . second first years elmo 3-in-1 , cup pinched his behind 3 places leaving cuts . this one great . although my son hesitant go it first ( which i attribute his experience elmo potty ) , he fits nicely it . other potties too narrow front back , i adjust him several times get him situtated so he could use front guard . seat lifts out cup which lends itself not pinching his bottom ; easy clean up . it low enough ground his legs fit too . back arm supports fit well also . it solid construction good buy .	1
after i my 2nd son , we bought graco double stoller , but it so long , heavy cumbersome i only used it few times before we decided get rid it . we bought this tandem stroller few months ago i love it ! great stoller , lightweight , easy manuvuer my 4 year old loves ride it b/c he either sit or stand back . it much smaller when folded up than most other double strollers market too . i wish i known earlier it also infant carseat attachment . i highly recommend this stoller , but wish parent tray/cup holder came standard stoller	1

i admit i absolutely no desire sterilize bottles old fashioned way ( boiling water pot stove ) so when i saw this product over seven years ago i bought one immediately . i loved it so effortless ! pay attention instructions tell you how much water use based your microwaves wattage . no one wants wonder if bottles sterilized or so-so when it comes their child , so read instructions . i also purchased when my second daughter born because i gave my sister first one . my only issue because its small size ( it fit microwave after all !!!! ) , you really stack bottles , nipples , etc . way utilizes all available space . once again , instructions clearly tell you best way stack . so , if your sleep deprived , hormonal state you actually manage read stupid small instruction booklet you save yourself lot heartache	-1
i used this my third child . i washed it over over , always , stains came right out . it so soft !!!! definitely good buy	1
we got this before our little one born . she born little premature only 4 lbs . we used it her bedside bassinet , later her crib . although we few false alarms once she started moving around crib , they worth it peace mind all other hours . baby girl now two we continue use it . she toddler bed now , we tell if she gets out bed when she not supposed ! this great device everyone should one . comparible price other nursery monitors , you get so much more . it also clear sound little interference our house	1
hello kitty chair just adorable , quality craftmanship outstanding . my 15 month old grand daughter crawled right up into it christmas morning knew just how start rocking . its just right size . thank yo	1
we love diaper dekor referred it many our friends family ! it super simple use refills which seem expensive first actually cheaper than other brands because they last 2-3 months vs . week ( i.e. diaper genie) ! reading other reviews , i think i clear few things up - it seems these people misled hence their problems this product . first , there 2 versions this pail - larger called diaper dekor plus regular size called simply diaper dekor . thus , there 2 different sizes refills , plus regular . you find out which model you simply opening door pail - there sticker model there - if you not see plus anywhere , you need buy regular refills - plus not fit , vice versa . secondly , refills very easy insert , you simply follow directions which come unit . basically , you remove plastic insert , wrap opened refills inside insert around top - excess refill wraps around outside plastic then you sit it pail - knot tied bottom new refill . if you unit , this make sense - if you haven't bought one yet , i probably just confused you - but you see once you get it it very easy ! last but not least , refills market past year absolutely no scent all - i personally would not mind baby powder scent but these no scent . it not like i sniffing inside pail or anything , so it doesn't matter - afterall , once refill pail , no scent come out - not even dirty diapers ! unfortunately , it seems these few reviewers who gave this product poor rating misinformed store workers their poor review actually nothing product but rather frustration stemming unknowledgable employees baby stores . i hope this helped ! we've this unit nearly year absolutely swear it ! it godsend ! no smells how much easier you get than just dropping diaper into pail not thing ! not many other units allow you store up 3 weeks diapers without single scent	1
i bought smaller version quot ;d iaper decorquot ; ( opposed larger quot ;d iaper decor plusquot ;) 18 months ago . although i believe smaller version discontinued year ago , i not yet problem finding refill liners my local babies us or on-line here amazon . i highly recommend diaper decor . i not any experience diaper genie , so i cannot compare . i not any odor problems diaper decor . it very easy change liners there no mess . my foot-operated lid opener also broke like some other reviewers , but this not problem me . i just open lid manually leave it open while i am changing diaper . i would recommend diaper decor plus size	-1
this best potty seat you buy . it one piece so it easy clean if you boy it great splashguard . also , i love handle so you hang it wall	1

i parent who said " i'll never spoil my child wipe warmer -- it only encourage her wear diapers longer . " then i woke up realized warm wipes night mean baby who doesn't cry during changings goes back bed more easily -- this could mean extra half hour sleep me . i am now big fan warmer . it works very quickly doesn't dry them out , light just bright enough change baby night without waking her up . definately nice product .	1

i fabric seat saver my leather seats before . needless say fabric doesn't protect leather very well . i ended up deep depressions leather . hopefully leather go back ( fingers crossed ) . firm bottom piece seems work well prevent any more indentations showing up . both carseats secure ever . i rear forward facing models .	1
even though it looks like it not fit beginning , it fits perfecly . evenflo also gives you extention piece it . we needed this piece our size opening , we really squeeze it , but it great fit . gate sturdy pleasing eye . it took 2 days us get used locking mechanism , using 2 hands first . after some practice it easy use . we liked it so much we bought .	1

i love this sling ! but i'd like stress other people you practice it find what works you . it may too big your newborn . i started using it when my son 4 weeks , but he large baby . i've found key wear it high ! instructions say you your baby more comfortable baby chest height . it true ! if you try wear it baby hanging little lower near your stomach it going hurt your back shoulder wear you out he/she going squirm uncomfortable . i used it every day my sons 3rd month when we hotels moving . now i used it every time i grocery shop because soon he it he falls asleep , no matter time day . if i try push him through whole store sitting cart his carseat he'll start screaming but if i put him my sling i won't hear peep out him whole trip . you admit it so cute stylish ! several people stopped ask me where i got it i love directing them amazon !	1
we very irregular iron banister different sized spaces bars . this perfect solution because you place tie-down holes wherever you need ties it comes really long , so they fit around large or small bars . we use drill make some holes further edge plastic because hole punch it comes wouldn't reach , but it very easy . i also like this product because it doesn't take away look banister or obscure vision	1

we received graco travel system our registry , got some good use out it . however , we big city , stroller just couldn't stand up bad sidewalks roads . not mention it so rickety i'm positive we could heard mile away . i broke down ordered jeep liberty limited urban terrain jogger , i love it . 1 . it simple assemble . 2 . it easier my hands wrists steer . 3 . air-filled tires provide much smoother ride my daughter . 4 . toy steering wheel ? she freaks out over it , good way . she * beeped * her horn 30 consecutive times grocery store . since distracted her pulling boxes off shelves , i am ultra pleased . 5 . price wonderful . we don't use music move feature , so i can't really comment it . i fill tires right before we leave house every time , it not hard , so i no complaints there . it bulky item , so transporting it carrying it bit tricky . however , pros all outweigh cons me . i am extremely pleased it	1

my 1 1/2 year old son really enjoys this toy . he loves putting little men top . he doesn't play toys side , guess thats younger kids , but he enjoy shape sorter drawbridge opening cute holds his attention . i find advantage over classic fisher price he can't easily just rip cover off toss pieces when he gets frustrated . this age , i find alphabet pieces waste wish there more shapes sort . perhaps when he older he'll enjoy letters well , but i doubt he'll still interested . overall , cute toy holds his attention while many not . main drawback there only 4 shapes sort	-1
i my wife very pleased jeep wrangler all-weather umbrella stroller . unlike cheap umbrella stroller we used , this one better construction main folding support tubes . plus , handles longer which means i ( 5'-1 '' guy ) don't walk like neanderthal push my toddler . wheels work pretty well most surfaces even very light snow . brakes durable plastic should last longer than my previous stroller . pouches added plus storing snacks or bus passes . my only disappointment sun screen . it not useful blocking sun my son eyes unless i pull it directly front him . point , he can't see anything . that ok if he falls asleep , but otherwise he ( independent todler ) pull sunscreen off if it blocks his view . added bonus would shoulder strap i could use carry stroller walking more than few feet . while it light compact stroller , it still cumbersome carry if you fold it bus or walk anywhere it . frequently my son wants walk so i take stroller me because i know he'll get tired . so again , shoulder strap would make toting stroller much easier	-1
they're little pricey , but they work great . they easy clean , dry quickly , catch almost all mess my boys make	1
i used this pump my first child 2 years ago . i tried avoid paying $300+ electric pump , this worked great ! i pumped when i returned work , pumped 3 months . i loved not lug around big electric pump work every day . it much easier clean than other manual pumps ( e.g. gerber ) because there few parts remove so your chance losing or breaking parts much lower . pump strong suction , so i've no problem expressing milk ( e.g. up 8 ounces or more each time ) . i just my 2nd child month ago , already i'm able express 5+ ounces milk once . i highly recommend this , especially occasional users , no need spend lots money fancy pumps lots removable , breakable parts . also , i am small chested , so no , you don't well endowed this work	1
i love love loooooove this system ! i pumping exclusively 4 months now only found this month ago . before this , i pumping storing medela bottles , then transferring playtex liners before feeding . then i wash all medela bottles , plus playtex rings , etc . this system , i just pump right into liners . they so easy just grab out fridge go . i warm bottle car warmer using self-contained liners , instead bring medela bottle warm , plus playtex system . overall , this saved me several steps less things wash . dad who said it threw off ounce markers - true . however , liners themselves ounce markings them . just unscrew top ring slightly so liner sinks back down then read ounce marker liner . easy ! i would not buy this system use storing frozen milk ( if you store lot it ) . it would get too expensive my tastes . i two sets perfect refrigerator storage . make sure you get two , because each box only comes one pump adapter . highly recommended one happy mamma	1
i tested this unit maximum sensitivity . first , i bothered constant tick indication baby ok . so i took sensor out see what would happen without baby , ... it stopped ticking . baby not moving , but just it heart and/or lungs working keeps unit ticking . it detects even when you blow sensor . maybe it should not maximum sensitivity , since ceiling fans , etc might activate it , but i truly amazed sensitivity . you turn tick down so it not too bothersome , it like clock ticking , once second when baby ok , if it stops ticking 30 seconds .. noticeable alarm ring .	1
i love this sack . highly recommend it especially if your child likes kick blankets up over their heads . before i purchased this i found her sleeping coveres over her head twice !!!	1
it so difficult carry huge diaper bag while your baby carrier . this product solves problem ! it cute too . i shopping babys ' ' us recently sales girl asked where i got my " super cute " diaper bag/carrier . i told her she insisted her manager store start carrying item ( no word yet whether or not they ) . i recommended this bag all my friends bought two shower gifts . it ultimate convenience fashion	1

i'm mother 21-month-old . i just got puppy hard time managing stroller leash our walks . this backpack perfect . it fits me well my daughter loves it . she asks stay it when we're ! i worried because she never liked any baby carriers i've tried before when she younger . you toughen up your shoulders ( taking shorter walks first ) before going any long hikes , course . i don't understand chest problem one other reviews , because chest strap adjustable , long , sits just below shoulders , avoiding " busty " area very well . however , it come out box shortest setting , so you loosen it fit your frame . question able " close " frame child it doesn't seem issue mine . stand part folds up easily under child once child your back . you need long enough arms grab it behind you , though . it makes no difference you or child if you leave frame open position during your walk , but if you're tight quarters , you'll want close it . i make mistake trying put aeryn ( my daughter ) feet behind me frame first , which made her knees rest uncomfortably frame . legs supposed go naturally forward toward either side your waist . ( picture box helped me figure out . ) it kids 6 months up 36 months , comes clear rain shield easily zips onto retractable sun shield . rain shield also helpful windy conditions- my daughter thinks it cool leans over fog it her breath . it not easy six-month-old puppy jumping around you , but i've even managed get into straps stand up floor aeryn pack ( i'm reasonably fit , she just under 30 pounds ) . this thing rugged , comfortable , good-looking , " prepared " features like cellphone holder matching fanny pack ( carried frame , if you'd rather )	1

i received my original new native sling baby shower gift back 1997 . i wore it nearly every day 15 months then again babies #2 #3 . now we expecting our fourth baby fabric bit faded worn ( we purple one ) , so i thought it time buy second sling . original still good far stitching goes we'll still use it , but i'm bit tired purple color after nine years ! :) pros : this sling smallest far packing it you . it simple double band fabric folded up your bag or purse easily . men don't mind wearing it ( least my husband didn't ) , it comes basic solid colors doesn't scream " baby ! " when you're out . many people couldn't tell i wearing baby when she little . it good place baby nap cover you up bit when you nurse , once you figure out . it more versatile than other types baby carriers you use it newborn toddler ( i've even used it two-year-olds short periods when they tired walking stroller isn't option ) . you carry baby your front or back ( experience , this doable , but mostly older babies ) , your hip ( once your baby sit strongly ) . it also easy throw wash when baby diaper inevitably leaks or spits up all over it . ( no complicated latches , webbing or snaps clean . ) cons : if you get wrong size , baby hang too low your back hurt . my original large size ( based chest measurements manufacturer ) but i'm going order medium this time . my husband still likes large , but he longer torso than i . newborns may need some support new native sling , otherwise you may feel they swimming fabric . i always use tightly rolled-up receiving blanket place it sling first , then lay baby head back top it . this pushes baby up enough toward opening so you don't feel like she lost there . usually i only this first few weeks . after while , your baby big enough peek out her own wave people . trickiest thing new native carrier learning sling baby your back , which enables you things like cooking unloading dryer while your baby sleeps . you put baby your front first then shimmy fabric around baby it . if you master this , sling ideal fussy baby or all-day babywearing . highly recommended ! good value your money .	1
i don't know what one reviewies talking .. if you read manual , you learn you need move " leg " front so seat sits level . keep your childs ' head falling forward . if fails , go burlington coat factory get wedge , prop it up more ..

my daughter got this toy when she 2 months old she still loves it ( 8 months ) . it only toy would keep her entertained car trips first . i took one star off due some minor problems : 1 ) it not machine washable ( unless you don't mind loosing barking sound ) 2 ) battery can't replaced .	-1
we like this car seat price we paid . likes : love easily adjustable belts - we often let straps out lot get her it without her uncomfortable then tighten it appropriately . 5 point harness great . love car seat compatible different strollers . dislikes : it doesn't recline much we'd like head padding superficial . our baby head tends fall forward lot . sun canopy seems like it designed afterthought - it certainly works more than adequately , but doesn't move easily . finally , handle difficult move position position . overall though , price , it good seat .	-1
my daughter received this gift mommy when she 3 1/2 months . first , she petrified objects so close her face , but if you take off ring take it higher , your child really appreciate colors enjoy toy . only complaint i mirror it comes still frightens my child . mirror distorts your child vision , so i took it off purchased some other hanging toys it ! my daughter loves it , she could eating her breakfast , or sitting her swing all she'll stare her playmat ! definite must all parents	1

good things : ( 1 ) no interference . we live residential neighborhood suburbs . ( 2 ) connects no problem two stories down baby 2nd floor monitor basement . i've even used it out yard without any loss connection problems .

i own lot strollers my twin sons (( this one , duoglider , two small single strollers , double umbrella stroller )) i absolutely love this one ! first all , if you want satisfied customer you know what purpose stroller , which jogging , or maneuvering outdoors rough terrain . my husband jogs stroller least once week (( no complaints )) , but i other hand just adore it outdoors . wheels go over almost any surface , including gravel , dirt , grass , concrete , brick , sand , boardwalk anything , i love it . seats both fully recline (( individually )) when they , rear seat mesh so you see your child behind (( although you would most-likely bend down get good look )) . five-point harness jogger must , this model even comes comfortable pads well . basket huge holds everything we need day beach/park/walk around block , which very important me . it also removable , but i don't see why it would advantageous take it off . plenty other storage available behind seats well , handy little pockets pouches store little knick-knacks . considering type stroller it , it folds very easily , i fit it rear my minivan after removing rear front tires (( which equally easy , rear tires come off push button front easy use release mechanism )) . canopy enormous proves great sun protection when needed ! breaks fantastic , stop stroller its tracks which very important if you jogging , need stop quickly , according my husband anyway . included wind/rain shield also very convenient (( left rolled up top canopy , incase there chance rain you don't work 5 minutes attach it get kiddos wet )) , but i wish it also came mesh covers mosquitos other bugs . i dislike fact it extremely difficult turn (( although i kind gotten it down science , you need prepared turn tilt stroller bit , turn very wide not smooth )) . i think it would better if it swivel wheel which option lock place jogging (( swivel wheel would actually extremely dangerous if jogging you could lose control stroller )) , but that just me personally . baskets near impossible access if both seats reclined all way , i wake sleeping babies few occasions (( that why i learned put things such my cell phone wallet canopy pouches , so i don't constantly go into basket )) . canopy quite large , if you not using it its quite pain retract it doesn't go back neatly , if its windy day canopy doesn't always stay up . if you looking good stroller outdoor use , don't mind large size or getting used turning , then i highly recommend tike tech	-1
i ton research convertible infan t-t oddler car seats before my son outgrew his graco snugride 4 months . consumer reports gave this seat highest safety ratings ( this seat highest rating all britax convertible seats ! ) i chose this seat because it eps side-impact protection under carseat cover . it worth extra money because it your child life ! also , it really easy tighten loosen straps , cover really silky comfortable . my son falls asleep within minutes pulling out driveway . my only gripes none existing toddler pillow neck/head supports fit into seat , but may problem manufacturers supports , not britax . also , straps don't soft covers keep them digging into my son neck . i just bought some soft terrycloth ones babies us $4.99 . it works	1

overall , we very happy this product . i like it covers entire side crib doesn't come up only partway like traditional bumper . also , i like breathable netting since baby see out through it since it " gives " bit when baby pushes kicks it . we nonstandard length crib ( babee tenda ) , so we small gaps each end rail , but we read this issue review babee tenda crib owner , so we knew up front we would these gaps . these small gaps not problem us our baby doesn't seem want stick her legs through gaps this location ( i think it difficult since she would lie almost flush headboard or footboard so ) . white satin edge very pleasant look . overall i like this product much more than traditional bumpers i seen .	-1
my baby outgrew regular sized swaddle me 2 months age . i ordered this one when it came mail i couldn't believe how huge it looked ! we didn't actually use it until 2.5 -3 months since it so big . we would fold top down before we swaddled our son this so it wasn't long . 3.5 months , our baby weighs 17 pounds so it hard find something swaddle him , he still needs it . i hope he doesn't outgrow this one near future . i think he'll one those kids who swaddled till he 6 months old this blanket should work	1
bring co-sleeper up height bed , these leg extensions best bet . yes , someone else said , they make it little shaky . so if you not planning attach co-sleeper your bed , you may want leave height alone .

b.o.b. rocks . bob very high quality held up extremely well us after nearly 2 years use . we're little attached bob our house . let me tell you revolution stroller get . we bought it right after our baby born , choked up $40 or so infant seat bar used it our primary stroller ever since . even mall , department stores , etc it great . baby gets smooth ride daddy likes it because it agile almost effortless push . i see hundreds bugaboo strollers around i must admit they nice but b.o.b my choice because price you go more places him . our other seldom used stroller graco something or other i don't even know where it . however i've used it enough compare it bob when collapsing it putting it car . i must say bob easier faster fold o.o ne downside might storage compartment under seat smaller than some those jumbo strollers . however , bob built like tank . we travel bob lot through airports ( yes bob fits through most airport xray while normally collapsed but sometimes i take off back wheels which easy ) we hang stuff off bob handlebars even carry our jumbo car seat top sun shade until we get our car . our family now looking double or tandem stroller . this get interesting because i don't see us doing duallie bob revolution since it no-go mall , target , etc . phil ted e3 buggy double buggy looking tempting but i don't like older child sits tucked behind stroller .. they can't see anything . what i wish b.o.b. corp would come up attachment least same phil ted ..... but tandem stroller revolution would sweet !	1

my months ' experimentation ' few purchases err , this best product its sort out there . it only product i've purchased ( or tried out store ) truly requires only one hand ! my 8 month old my shoulder , i drop this bag into cart seat , i unzip it flip ' diaper pocket ' over back , pull generous , elastic edged cover up over cart handle that just it . additionally , buggy bag among few covers whole cart , ( uniquely ) adds further protection germs 2 separate belts : one go around your child waist , other secure it cart . not forgotten : buggy bag comfortable ( apparently ! ) , simple convenient storage options stores itself w/ ease ! other hand , i tried one imitation popular baby store not only it not open one hand ( necessity baby your hip grocery store parking lot ! ) but i could not get it back into its ' carrying ' shape two hands !! i hid it shelf moved away quickly . eek . product i purchased online came two pieces so many clips belts wrapping it together , i could barely attach it both hands help passersby . while it ' shoulder straps unlike any other , they dont work most carts put advertising placard back cart seat . finally adjusted , product ( " shop'n'dine " ) didnt cover most cart . ( its debut shopping trip ) i threw it back car went home , too tired shop . finally , there lots imitators out there , dont suckered similar names , better price points or preferred fabric choices : buggy bag preserve your sanity , perhaps , your child health .	1

armoire very pretty but please show pictures inside furniture pieces because i expecting something else . i still like it very much but i wanted part hang clothes it doesn't one . it very pretty outside it everything i expecting !!! thank you	-1
crib just way it comes best . thicker mattress would bad 2 reasons . firm best avoid suffocation dangers . bumber pads also recommended against * all * modern advice sites classes . sids deaths appear related suffocation , this happens usually when baby mouth nose against padding . firm mattress ( like this very thin one ) much safer . main thing always lay infant it back sleep , not it belly . also , never use bumber padding * any * crib any very young child . finally , there also issue " outgassing " any kind waterproof plastic type matress covers foam filling . what you want , if you can't afford very expensive natural options , * thin * mattress like this one , won't lot material outgas , thus reducing exposure your baby these common somewhat toxic vocs . best buy this few weeks ( or longer ) ahead time , then air out mattress . i'm even putting ours clothes dryer low heat just past switch off point , so drying heats it up little then clicks off heat continues exhausting air past it until end cycle . this my own idea how accelerate outgassing , so our new baby january won't much vocs breath .	1

i received this set baby shower back 2005 . it held up really well . my only advice : retail price $232.00 even amazon price $152 , it still too steep . i never quilt crib because it dangerous so baby - he constantly napping , so i hardly ever " made " bed . next time around , i'm going find pattern i like just buy all decorative things associated it , then buy inexpensive plain bumper sheet . room itself what you everyone else sees . bedding almost impossible see , unless you're hovering over crib . i especially love lamp , switchplate , mobile 5-pc wall hanging this collection . you could buy all accessories truly create safari room less than cost bedding alone .	-1

despite some negative reviews i got this seat because i 8 mth 2.5 yr old my husband deployed so bathtime very challenging . i also textured bathtub bottom so i knew bathring would not work . well this seat fantastic - my baby loves sit it tries grab all bath toys so he chew them . also , whenever i get baby toddler wants jump too which so much easier then conjoling ornery 2 yr old into tub . since using bath seat my infant hasn't scraped his legs it once like some other reviewers mentioned so not sure what . although he tried climb out couple times he usually content sit there . course even this seat you can't let such little ones bathe unsupervised anyways so it fine when he tries get out - i just put him back he happy . even when i don't bath two together i put little one here - just makes it so much easier then trying hold him steady ( he such wiggler - trying crawl/stand immediately)and my hands free scrub him . clean his bottom i just pull him out clean him then stick him back - no problem . clean seat i've followed advice other posts again no problem . i actually came back here buy one my sister but i see it isn't available right now -boo - i'll find it elsewhere . highly recommend	1

this pump works great occasional use after 5 months , i still not encountered any problems suction some reviewers mentioned . ( instruction book explains how clean motor event suction loss , so hopefully problem avoidable . ) however , beware motor very loud -- i definitely wouldn't recommend taking this one work or anywhere else you would need discreet . ( when i use it , i sit bathroom fan so my family doesn't hear it ! ) i also recommend buying micro-steam bags medela so you just throw parts microwave clean them right away each time you use them	-1
i breast fed my son year 2003 medela pump back then . i trusted medela pick up this one my daughter this year . i pump once day , so they get used , but not abused . model changed some , i think it more powerful this time . thing i don't like , but certainly live , motor not attached breast shield . my chest rather large , so putting bottles unit holding unit my chest one hand not option . i hold each shield upto my chest motor sits my lap . i can't control speed or turn unit on/off because i don't free hand . i leave speed where i need it before take bottle off while it still put it bottle holder while i turn unit off . i still very much like this product it gets job	-1

my daughter ( 2 1/2 yrs old ) likes this cot , lot . i bought it her so she could nap it while my m-i-l over watching her since she hard time stairs lifting toddler into high crib . she sleeps it 1 1/2 - 2 hours afternoon , which 1 hour shorter than if she nap her crib inside her ( darkened ) room . it suits this purpose well i intend taking it overnight weekend trips so we don't haul her port-a-crib . only disadvantage she get out it , course , but ... it cot ! she began daycare recently sleeps their cots same amount time , so i figured i'd buy it my m-i-l home . it trick my baby thinks it special . i tell her it only when grandma over ( b/c she wanted start sleeping/napping it all time ) . naturally , i'd prefer she take longer nap , so i told her it special days only , when grandma here . so now she uses it " tuck " her bunny-bear stuffed animal before she goes her room night . i love it , it seems comfortable , very portable handy . i would recommend it . only reason i'm not rating it 5 stars i yet use it weekend trip , but i wanted review it now , case you wondering whether or not get it . i think it very much worth it , but everyone different . it relatively small inexpensive so if your child hates it they may like it their stuffed animal friends . also , it very sturdy supportive opens collapses no trouble all . hope helps	-1
all reviews written this product recalled , incorrect . it original hip hammock all those stores removed shelves . so unless you older model bought before 2/2005 , you should nothing worry . this product great when your baby outgrowns front carriers like baby bjorn . i no problems it it easier than using sling older babies .	-1
i love these cups better yet so my baby ! they easy her hold soft tip makes it easy her drink . she no idea it not bottle . it made transition away bottle so much easier . thank you	1
i got four these sleepsacks , two fleece two cotton . i found fleece sleepsacks get bitty after couple washes , but it didn't effect product . they wonderful . if you buying newborn , get 6-12 month size , since it'll last bit longer . i ended up giving away 0-6 month size , when my baby only 3 months old , it getting bit small .	1
this product works well my dr brown bottles . there holes it make it easy stand up inner parts bottles . much better looking than lot bottle drying racks . i use sassy rubber bristled bottle brush so it won't scratch bottles , though . sassy color totally coordinates perfectly	1
very convenient carseat , placed combi double stroller , which only side side stroller i seen you attach infant seat into . ( i've searched lot ) carseat comprable peg perego primo viaggo ( whichi also ) but you ; connect one into aria twin , peg perego side side . seat itself lightweight easy manage , very soft foam insert . it easy get into car or without base . only complaint would straps could little longer because you can't both baby bunting bag foam insert otherwise straps aren't long enough comfortably get baby out . also , our daughter extremely colicky 5 weeks 12 weeks would only sleep this carseat , so it must pretty comfortable	1
this bed hard put together but it well worth trouble . it great buy price . you can't go wrong if you little time patience put it together	1
when we got our changing table friend who no longer needed it ... they gave us diaper depot well . i love how it puts everything arms reach without clutting changing table . it lasted two kids before one it now , so total three babies . i guess like anything if it taken care properly it won't break	1
my 6 month old daughter just transitioned her infant seat carrier britax boulevard loving it . she looks comfortable it , i really appreciate side impact support case accident . i really see her growing into it well . it little large our camry but there still enough room one other person ( instead 2 ) backseat	1
i climber ! she could climb out her crib age 13 months . she way too young bed . we also crib tent ii both items allowed us feel our now 22 month old daughter safely her crib night -- not roaming her room or house while we sleep . it either these products or emptying all furniture out her room , putting mattress floor , putting lock her door night keep her safe . life saver	1
what great product . no tools , just click , click , click , it ready use . anchors keep unit place under mattress . frame metal not plastic ! i am very pleased quality , look . it out box , bed 10 minutes . :	1
i used both this product disposable kind stickers keep them table , i like both different reasons . disposable ones sort expensive , but very portable when i am flying visiting relatives . hippo one great grab go around town , when i am not concerned weight my diaper bag . i waiters thank me many restaurants ! just fold mess right up clean home ! my son way too young plate not toss it , i don't want him eating off table probably full nasty germs . this hippo really durable too , i used this same mat over 3 years , ( i first got it my daughter ) it still looks great	-1
i agree above reviewers . this rug large very well made . perfect any little girl room	1
we bought this trip we taking may but when my daughter saw it she got it immediately . she wants sit it watch tv , take walks or put her dolls it . light weight makes it easy take use more places me . this helps my back problems since i am more likely stoller me now . it easy open , shut lock . i wish it place hang or store smaller baby bag though . i also like ride smooth victoria she option reclined or sit upright . large padded hand grips help more control comfort stroller also .	1
this bib it all there no complaints whatsoever ! i used go through 8-10 bibs every few days , but now this only bib i use every day , all day ! easy wash , catches everything so there little mess or around my child it easy , easy off !	1
this gate some good points just one negative . pros - good price , easy operate . mine very easy batteries , i replace them every 2 months . they located kid bedroom doorways , 8 ' apart each other . we use them double safety top stairs , keep roaming 22 month old out his sister room when she wants some quiet time . those you who multiple gates complain 1 control unlocking both gates you should know if you replace batteries same time arm first gate it sends out signal both gates programs it unlock both . so simply set up one gate while batteries out other , then set up second gate seperately . i never them malfunction following these steps . cons : i also my toddler wedge knee door . i found this due gate not tight enough . it very frustrating little scary but we always able help him out gate sitting him down pulling him straight back . we nearly got rid this gate because few times dealing this . but since we tightened up pressure gate we no problems . it also stripped some paint my doorway where tension feet .. right down bare wood . i repaint patch when these gates come down . also should little taller imo , if gate not tight enough it become dislodged open . always check gate when you close it make sure it closed .. few rare occasions i found it not completely closed . this usually happens when you manually open gate then try use remote button open it . overall , 4 stars . would 5 stars if gate taller bars little closer prevent pinching . good price though it put together well	-1
we purchased this gate use our youngest four daughters . pressure gates we already difficult our 3 5 year olds get pass it gets difficult constantly lifting them over gate . this gate well worth money . remote unit wall place where everyone reach it , except 13 month old course . it so much easier everyone . all use our gate gets , spot welds broke one day . you really miss this gate when you go back using pressure gate again . i called customer support , concerned because i longer my receipt or even box . spot welds breaking loose problem they hadn't reported before ( so this apparently isn't common problem ! ) i told we would receive new gate within two weeks old one would inspected engineers determine what occured . i very impressed ! i sure check out evenflo products first when purchasing any new child/baby products their customer support alone . service like not so common anymore . like i said , great concept service	1
my husband i loved look shapes moblie . my baby face just lights up when he placed his bed naps or night time . however we find ourself running back forth so much because cute little songs stopped before he falls asleep . i looking online saw some these new mobiles remotes them . it would seem all new things come out manufactors would given public option wind up mobile or remote mobile . i hope someone these places reads these takes time put more thought into what parents would want future purchases . but like i said before we love look love they way my son reacts it . so i'll look this mobile weight loss bonus all running back forth	-1
fan baby einstein line products , i put this my registry . what great gift it turned out . it could entertain my daughter when nothing else ! she now 16 months old too big it , but when she started watching baby einstein videos , she recognized characters this center	1

our little one loved this toy until he turned 8 months . now its really challenge try get him into this thing or baby einstein stationary entertainer ( see my review ) . however , he still play it standing outside loves touching legs toys chewing bar . unfortunately he puts up fight when we try get him it . but we good run this it worth it . he would bounce back forth say " ahhhhhhh ! " just laugh really hard . so glad someone gave this us we didn't buy it . but if you making decision , i say it totally worth it .	1

this sort product wasn't available my first child . it such pain get him into winter outerwear , even more pain take it off when we got where we going . when i found this bundleme product , i knew it would much easier survive winter months michigan my second child . it fits easily into my graco infant carseat/carrier . i don't worry dressing him up , i just put hat him off we go !! it also easier buckle baby up without so much extra clothing bunching up everywhere- probably safer too !! when we get where ever we going i just unzip sides he fine . so far we endured 40 degree temps , rain , wind snow he stayed warm snug bug whole time !! truly excellent purchase !	1
our daughter born october so we used bundle me all time . it so easy just buckle her up go instead bundling her up sweaters jackets . she got older however she would push top flap away but i wasn't worried because it wasn't cold march ( she still quite warm ) . you might want think this if you active baby .	-1
wow ! this best thing i received my baby . it saved me sooo much time . i would normally layer my daughter before heading out door but i just don't need worry this . i feel sorry all people who bought my daughter thick sweaters , aunt who bought her snow suit . we just never use them . i zip her into bundle me head out walk stroller . she usually falls asleep because she finds it so cozy . when she smaller , we used it infant car seat which fit into our stroller . it meant she zipped before we opened door unzipped when we reached our destination . she never felt cold ! it really easy use fits our two different strollers car seats .	1
i just bought this babiesrus store . easy setup . my baby loves bright colors music . i highly recommend this anyone	1

our daughter turning 2 years old this week i felt it time finally write review this amazing product . very beginning , she incredibly alert interested baby . she born c-section 38 weeks eyes hands wide open . once they finished cleaning her up , my husband i thrilled just cuddle her talk her while she looked us both wide eyes made little coo coo sounds . right away she great nursing very good latch . she rarely ever cried , when she , it quiet little " lay lay lay " sound , not wild waa-waa . throughout infancy she always capable adapting every situation quickly without emotional outburst . where it would seem other children would over-stimulated environment , she would thrive seem want more stimulation ! only three months age , people thought she older because her alertness interest people animals . she hit every developmental milestone months early , especially language ( sign speech ) , music appreciation , colors/shape/letter/number recognition . her pediatrician happily surprised her suggested i should five more just like her ! when we bought babyplus , we thought , " if it helps only 10% well testimonials say it , it worth it " . we're certain it contributed positively helping develop this little miracle ours . we're now expecting child #2 ( 25 weeks ) although not using baby plus could interesting experiment ( same gene pool , same parenting , etc . ) , we're too interested possibilities how much it may contribute our next child us withhold it .	1
i began using system when i 18 weeks pregnant but could not keep up schedule fast pace career . i stopped when i 31 weeks . i thought my efforts went down drain not try look any benefits baby plus . however , when i went back testimonials compare i realized my son accomplished many same feats other baby plus babies . i cannot believe only 13 weeks using this system such positive impact my son development . he never colic , extremely happy expressive since he born , laughs if it rolling his toes since he 4 months , latched immediately after birth today vocabulary 50 words , not including animal sounds he make or hand gestures he memorized his favorites songs . i highly recommend this product	1

this nice chair , except brakes . they lock so easily if you just barely brush them your foot , they lock . it seems all you look them they lock . since we constantly moving chair us , or back wall , etc ., this real problem because you unlock them ( esp . if more than one four locked ) order move chair easily . baby gets heavier heavier becomes toddler , this even harder . pleats bottom seat pad probably unnecessary definately hard get crumbs out . if it weren't brakes , i would give it 5 stars . toy aquarium nice except they could make large push pads which make fish move around water , easier little ones push	-1

while my 4 yr old potty trained since she 2-1/2 , she wasn't making it thru night so we used pull up every night . shortly after she turned 4 she started waking up dry pull ups . we gave it few weeks make sure it wasn't fluke then invested * two * these pads . tuck feature both sides great i find it stay place even after nights sleep . she finds it comfortable she never complained it ( course , princess sheets accomanied this new pad encourage acceptance we made huge deal her giving up pull ups sleeping regular underwear ) . best part this design if there accident , you just whip it off ( any other top sheet might gotten wet ) tuck dry one . no changing fitted sheet middle night . us , if top sheet or blanket gets wet , i've got second comforter/blanket her closet quickly throw over her . ( course pajama changing can't avoided ) helps get everyone back sleep fast possible . i've washed them number times they come out dryer same shape every time ( follow washing instructions ) . size also generous . i worried she might move off pad during night , but proper placement where she normally sleeps most night , we've never problem . it says it absorbs 6 cups ; while we haven't tested , i've never found pad dripping , so all urine securely soaked . we haven't found down side these pads . even price isn't bad -- i some price comparison maybe you'll find them few bucks less , but not much . , if i may add bit my own potty training 2-cents , my husband wanted her give up pull ups much earlier , but i no mood change sheets ( or these pads ) * every * night . i've read most toddlers ' bladders aren't large enough make it thru night anyway , so i just happy let it happen naturally . way , everyone happy ( well i you know what they say mamma happy -- everyone happy ! ) thus , i highly recommend this pad anyone going down no-more-pull-ups road . i am sure it would just useful any older child ( parents ) dealing bed-wetting problem .	1

i too am very pleased this gate . over past week i installed one each top our two staircases . i strongly recommend following advice one other reviewers skip using template . lower fixture hinge side lowest ground , so i installed first , then held it place mark spot upper hinge . after , i put gate hinges , held it place marked opposite side . worked great , it allowed me work around mouldings , which would difficult template . wood screws held great one bannister one staircase . other staircase , i put gates into drywall . there beam one side , so i buy much longer screws ensure tight grip . other side hollow , so i bought some good metal anchors , so gate very tight . all i bring fixtures hardware store found screws anchors would fit holes . cost me $10 get enough anchors screws four gates . most poor reviews sound like there some hardware issues . i take one star away because i think gate should come alternate screws , maybe anchors , because i think it bad assumption most people installing into wood . i would very much recommend this gate , but advise paying close attention what you're installing into first make sure you've got right hardware	-1

this little kit two one . it all you need grooming all you need baby health . only thing we don't use clippers because we like one 1st years magnifing glass . comb brush perfect , she absolutely loves rattle ! surprise ! i thought it just kind extra , but we take it us everywhere . suction bulb isn't bad like others said . case it comes really great ! it pocket storing other things back which we use nose drops , tylenol , etc . it all one place great because we easily grab it go if we going grandma . i'm sure we'll using this into her toddler years !	-1
i recently purchased this potty my 16 month old son . we not actively training but i wanted introduce him it . first night i got it , he went pee pee boo boo it . i screamed clapped sang little song . he really likes it . he even brought it out bathroom took it into living room watch wiggles while sitting it . i like color , how it fits his size . he sit it get up all himself . its very sturdy , it doesn't wobble or tip over like some . one reviewer said sprout little short , but i haven't problem . my son tends look down himself while he going , so everything pointing south anyway . i love there only 2 pieces this chair . very easy clean . i safety 1st chair flip top lid detachable sprout i absolutely hated this thing . my son would pull sprout walk around house it . he too concerned lid turning around chair pull lid up down instead concentrating trying go potty . baby bjorn there no distractions , no music , no removable pieces(except bowl)which allows him focus going potty . i just really like this potty chair . i would highly recommend this chair	1

we purchased this gate fit around base odd shaped staircase ( those interested , it front stairwell wellington plan centex homes - it really popular down here centex subdivisions so i thought i'd share ) . i concerned finding anything would cover this area because odd shape but this gate job spades . it breeze install ( least compared some other gates ) . i it installed within 1 hour . usual these kind things , if you installing into sheetrock , forewarned anchors come gate hardware pooky you need buy some decent ones hardware store . that really my only complaint , but it seems always case any factory-provided hardware these days . we very pleased it it worth money .	1
my husband i bought this gate keep our precocious exceptionally curious toddler out kitchen . ( it took her week figure out how open all safety locks cabinets . ) when gate arrived box heavily damaged gate broken . we called customer service summer they new gate free return shipping label us three days ! installation fairly easy my husband who not particularly handy tools . we like fabric/mesh since our daughter can't climb it like other gates . only thing i don't like quite so much latching mechanism not terribly easy use . you line up gate then pull slightly handle seat latch properly . takes little while get used . all-in-all we would definitely recommend this gate others who large openings close off	1

it took one 2-year old supervisor 3 adults get this bed put together . this bed not come support mattress . however , you buy piece board material covering it toys us $38 . it worth money . our son loves bed . it very sturdy . headboard where you store " books " little bit shaky but nobody going sitting up there . he also loves area where you roll cars down . mom likes it o.o ne area , headboard , horrible put together because plastic not molded well it could . headboard four areas where you needed push thru then push it down stay intake . we ended up using oil kitchen get this accomplished like reviewer	-1

i originally bought britax boulevard my son who 2 out growing his regular convertable carseat . he 35 pounds needed seat would " fit " him . seat not so great . i sold it bought this one instead . i bought zebra print . seat big heavy , which i like since it looks feels so safe . i like instructions attached seat so you can't lose them . seat easy adjust fit my son very very easy install into my very small car ( suzuki esteem ) . after installing it seatbelt it not move all ... which we all know safe . installation so fast . i love belt lock offs . seat very plush soft . i love many covers available . my son sits comfortably this seat , there plenty room grow , crotch strap so much better this ( than boulevard ) i am sure we going able use this seat years come . i am so glad i found this . buy it , you not disappointed	1
when my son 5 months old , he almost too tall his infant carseat so my husband i started looking seat would last him until he old enough ride without one . initially , i wanted britax , but i didn't know anyone who one i really afraid spend $300 ( including tax ) seat . so we bought eddie bauer . i didn't hate it , it ok , but it not fit our car ( toyota rav-4 ) . so we gave seat my mother so she could use it occaision when she babysits we bit bullet bought britax - oh my gosh . we love it ! it installed like 2 minutes , i'm not kidding . i could not believe how simple it . my son ( who now 6 months ) loves it - he so comfy he sleep it without his head leaning way over like it eddie bauer . he never cries when he it - it sits up straight enough he look around which he also loves . fabric feels so wonderful wipes clean pretty easily . i love one hand strap adjustment velcro holds straps out way boarding . we're planning plane trip may , i tell you we'll taking this seat . when our next baby arrives , he or she riding britax . they rock	1
i'm grandma didn't want high chair sitting my kitchen when i only use it occasionally . this seat great bargain . i like it fit any chair adjusted different angles . fabric cover easy wipe clean cushion provides sufficient padding . i considered one seats slide over counter or table , but decided this one because i baby facing me directly . this makes easy feeding . i am very happy feeding seat	-1

very reliable item i used more then two years . i very happy simplicity ease use . i am surprized see this excellent product such low price . you can't go wrong .. go it	1
it nice thick keeps baby warm . only thing i would like different top held place elastic it would better if it fitted more snug top so it wouldn'tg slide down . but would recommend this product keep your toddler warm .	-1
this blanket great ! most meaningful me it waterproof , so even if ground wet , i'm not . it pretty easy spot clean wet wipe , but you also put it commercial-sized washer ( i've yet this ) . folds compactly carry strap .	1
when i bought this , i got " oh great ... more stuff won't ever get used clutter up my house " look my husband , which i reminded him tonight . i buy it prematurely- our almost 3 year old wasn't remotely interested using any potty , so it sit around while . but ever since she started using potty ( first hers , now ours w/ her seat ) , we taken it us everywhere . not just sanitary reasons , but every bit much size . we also use it pottys her grandparents ' houses or my husband office potty which we're only ones use . couple times ( tonight included ) we've forgotten it she go public , it nightmare . first there layers seat covers , then even worse trying position her little behind enormous seat big ol ' opening front which means her legs out angle so she doesn't end up right there . then she says it hurts all her weight two places where seat goes across her . yes , i pinched myself beginning when we hurry i didn't it down yet how it folded , but it well worth it my eyes . bottom line- i love it , i highly recommend it , i would totally lost without it . so worth three times ( more ) what i paid it	1
my mother law gave us this boppy , i am glad she . it easy run out new things young baby . so this nice pull out put floor let our little tommy experience pillow under his chest . i also put him his belly nothing under it so he experiance well . this interesting because bright colors toys attached . so far he isnt paying attention toys , but he still only just learning use his hands . so i am sure next couple months toys become more usefull . i like place brightlly colored book front him , he enjoys something his level look . he gets tired laying this pillow pretty fast , but our guy supper picky gets bored fast . also it small enough it stored out sight very easily . i think this makes great addition any collection	1
this boppy makes tummy time easy fun . pillow right size babies , makes tummy time no brainer	1
this product just simple ..... it everything it claims . our grandson much more comfortable , so means everybody else house too . it just so nice find product exactly what it supposed	1
our baby doesn't get gassy too much ( just few times per month ) , but when he , he straightens his legs screams nothing calms him . except gripe water , course ! within 30 minutes taking his dose he over it back normal . i also feel much better giving him this versus other anti-gas medicine , which actually drug	1

we bought rainforest peek-a-boo when we vacation because we forgot bring our usual soother . rainforest peek-a-boo great . our 5 month old fascinated it . soother its job terms helping him sleep . however , timer feature could improved . our son falls asleep better light sound . unfortunately longer , 18 minute , setting sound only . overall fisher-price rainforest very good product i would recommend	-1
my baby girl loves this ! it puts her right sleep every time . music it very soothing fun listen . highly recomended	1
i able take my little one out running stroller 7 weeks using snuzzler . i stuck smooth bike paths until she 4 months , but her little head didn't budge when she laying this thing . fact , i think she slept better running stroller w/ snuzzler than home ! two sides convenient b/c you just flip it over depending kind weather you're : fleece side keep her warm other keep her cool when it already warm out . 4 months , she didn't need it car seat or swing anymore , but it still seems comfy her running stroller even now 5 months	1
we live florida . it almost july . our newborn loves this thing . she currently happier her carseat snuzzler than anywhere . one side cozy fleece -- which would great cool weather , but not what we need . reverse navy fabric , it plenty cozy . it supports her head , so her head always upright , even long tripsand it gently supports her back arms . i rate this " must-have "	1
i six months pregnant twins , broken leg not-quite three year old who figured out pretty quickly he could outrun mama . when he nearly ran into parking lot , i bought this item because his safety my number one concern . when my son started getting rowdy crowded public location , i able slip this harness him very quickly easily because strategically placed velcro . i anticipated some snide comments passerbys , but not expect my son give me baleful look announce ( loudly ): " i not puppy , mama ! " needless say , my son not like it one bit but it comfortable doesn't restrict arms . it very good product , but it requires practicing your child before it effective because velcro give if you your child try go opposite directions	-1
we decided use cloth diapers because it so much cheaper than disposables . prefolded diaper service diapers definately way go too . i couldn't it if i fuss folding . also - if you plan cloth diaper - must 4 - 6 diaper wraps ( 10$ 2 @ bbrus ) . they like plastic pants only waterproof cloth covering . they also velcro instead pins . my hubby ( who hates wrapping anything ) loves offers change our newborn diapers since he easily handle velcro wraps . we diaper cleaning service first 2 months , i clean them my own since . it really not difficult everyone thinks it . plus it great environment . i strongly recommend cloth diapers wraps	1
these absorbant diapers they hold up regular abuse washing over over again . they need washed several times before they soft . i need mention if you choose cloth diaper your baby , you might want just use velcro covers first since weave very tight this diaper . i used pins , first , got frustrated , because they wouldn't go through diaper . after few washings , weave loosened bit i able pin them more easily	-1
we bought car seat our granddaughter . it real bargain , very safe , functional good long time attractive . only downside it challenge install it initially fit our granddaughter .	-1
our oldest child ready use booster seat ! i tired transferring car seats minivan my wrx whenever i wanted take our oldest me my car . so we bought this booter seat stay wrx trunk until needed . it works great ! it comfy my daughter , light weight , very easy use . we surprised , it much bigger real life it looks photos , ours colors reversed . dark blue fabric center light blue outside . cup holders awesome better quality than you think 20 bux would get you . we very impressed buying one other three kids grow out their car seats ! also , this one few boosters qualifies free shipping	1
i used fleece sleepsacks winter but needed something lighter spring summer . these cotton sacks great - no need blanket hence no worries baby smothering herlself	1
we love this wearable blanket so much we bought every kind . they wonderful . first i must say they , obviously , not confine arms , so if your baby still gets startled her jerky arm movements when trying fall asleep he/she may not ready this yet . i am slowly making transition miracle blanket over this . my baby still needs extra swaddling night when she fussy , but she likes freedom during her naps this provides likes get her fingers too . i not find my cotton sleep sack shrank . zipper doesn't lay exactly flat her , but i haven't found this problem all . i feel sizes run bit small . my baby wearing small size 23 " just outgrown it . i'd recommend getting them one size above what you think you need . i don't like there no arm sleeves all . i really would liked choice putting her one or without sleeves . this cotton so nice light i can't imagine it any lighter without fragle hold together . if you want one heavier , they come fleece quilted also , but remember there no sleeves . i very much like zipper " upside down " . it undoes bottom which means you don't completely unzip your baby diaper changes zipper tab doesn't poke into baby chin . btw , if you try put your baby arms inside sack instead out holes they probably get them out holes themselves - mine .	1
after tried every bottle brand we could find , we ended up preferring dr. brown . they definitely reduced amount gas our baby swallowing thus reducing amount spit up burps . measurements bottles spot , thus mixing formula them really easy . bottles very durable nipples . they take beating still look brand new , including measurement markings . i'm fairly certain bottles we last until our baby eating just solid food . yeah , parts pain clean . but we live . it not huge , huge deal . i say playtex disposables just good terms gas prevention , but we didn't feel good throwing away all those plastic containers added cost purchasing them . well , measurements them wildly inaccurate thus totally useless	-1
i bought this swing my granddaughter . it very easy get her out . she enjoys it . it make soft clicking sound similiar ticking clock . i think it good deal price	-1
love this product . it easy use , easy take , clean up cinch . no worries what table under topper . we've three restaurant employess ( different restaurants ) ask product their customers little ones	1

purchased upstairs nursery , it saved me stumbling downstairs kitchen late night/early morning feedings . fits avent well thinner bottles . i recommend using caps come your bottles when you warm up junior food ( repels condensation ) . i'd give it five stars , but beeps feature i wish could turned off user - note munchkin . worth every penny	-1
after doing research , i picked munchkin bottle warmer . good things this warmer quick , enough heat , good size ( we use avent bottle ) , easy care best thing auto shut off . we using 4 months day night without any problem . people compliant water adjustment , i usually use low level , my son never compliant	1
i used stroller only couple times try it out , my grandaughter still too young it . i like item very much . ii well designed , light , yet sturdy . i'm satisfied quality product look forward use it lot soon	-1
this lightest easiest stroller . it small enough stash trunk still able buy groceries . if my son decides he doesn't want ride it , it light enough fold up carry my shoulder . i like there sun shade i love 5-point harness , i used rain bonnet once marathon , i only one without wet kid . seat also angled towards back so child doesn't slide right out when you release buckes like some strollers . zippers both sides recline sleeping . it make slightly reclined chair , but he doesn't mind . very well made sturdy , mine through lot . i owned it 1 1/2 years no problems	1
this tub great if you dont want confine your child too much full sized bathtub , but also small enough keep it safe baby . since it blow up tub , all sides soft so baby wont bonk her head . there drain hole one end easy draining , suction cup underneath so you hang it up when not use . it also good if you going trip not sure if there tub give baby bath	-1
these bottles good choice if you're breastfeeding , but introduce bottle . my son never problem going breast this bottle back breast again . also , after months frequent use , i never experienced leaking problem these bottles mentioned some other reviewers . i also know other moms who used these more than year no leaks either . i even taken tops apart put them back together still no leaks	1
my baby now 3 weeks old , this his favorite chair . it actually doubling his bed right now , because it only thing i use get him sleep more than hour time ! i guess it little loud , but i think that what keeps baby sleeping ! love it	1
i think soothing motions glider great product . my 6 week old daughter loves it , she slept many hours it so far . it very soothing her . however , there doesn't seem much difference two speeds , noise get bit annoying . i can't say much music - i wish it bit more soothing her . regardless , she seems love it . we put it our coffee table so our dog doesn't lick her pieces ;) it very stable product	-1
haven't baby yet , but played this . easy set up . it make noise but low mechanical noise , which may soothing baby . i'm not sure if it suppose make kind noise . it not noticable music going . it moves steady slow . i think baby like it , i hope . i rated it 4 because noise	-1
we went swaddle blanket these sleep sacks . my daughter loves them . she still doesn't know how use blanket but doesn't need one sleep sack . i can't find xl stores - only online . i don't know what when she outgrows xl ...	1
after losing one daughter sids , i now worry everything . these blankets help ease my mind . i never liked idea receiving blankets because baby easily move her hands pull blank over her head . blankets provide warmth without risk going over her head . i usually put my daughter her p.j.s blanket , but really warm nights i just put her this . plus it sack it allows her move her feet around freely , which isn't case when she wears feet p.j.s because all her kicking her legs either get caught up croch area or p.j.s get twisted around . benefit this only product seal approval national sids alliance .	1
this very nice mattress seems very firm , which good baby . however , vinyl covering blue white check , which seen through sheets . this feature not readily visable product photograph unless you select other pictures feature . also , there small tear binding edge mattress . our first mattress white , therefore there not pattern seen through sheets . good solution use mattress pad	-1
diaper genie ii works phenomenally . i would definitely recommend this product anyone who baby or expecting . it easy use , sturdy , exactly what it says it ; it locks odors keeps your house smelling like used diaper .	1

how much you write high chair ? my daughter fits seat . it looks comfortable , though i haven't tried it myself yet . tray goes off fairly easy one hand . looking hardware though doesn't give me much confidence this last more than one child . tray insert works well makes clean up much easier . would nice if they included 2 inserts , but i guess just one makes sure i clean it sooner . my daughter loves toy attaches tray . it really helps keep her amused while we prep her food she goes out her way hunt it down when she just playing not seat . assembly fairly easy instructions clear . i amazed they able break this down into many parts they . if you liked erector sets kid you'll like putting this together . it took 30 minutes hardly any foul language	1

i bought these sheets because other reviews stating thinner sheets horrible . these other hand nice soft . i washed dried these sheets ( because i didn't read instructions ) after reading few comments sheets don't fit after drying decided break them out try them myself . since our baby isn't due 6 weeks i didn't these things out yet ( because cat would think i set it up him ) . well , i only took out " mattress " if you . proceeded try put both sheets ( just make sure ) . it tight fit but i also figured it would since bunching around baby face not something i would wanted anyways . well sheets fit ( least " mattress " out my bed rather than travel crib itself . but it probably would easier make it way anyway . hope this helps	1

i tried couple other slings didn't work me . i didn't like over shoulder baby holder type one because i could never get it right . i snuggly type one which okay but still hard my back . this one lengthy but worth it once you used it become quick it . i found if i want work computer it great he sleeps my chest , snuggled up , i type both hands . i not tried nurse it so i am not sure how well works . i used it front tummy facing . my husband even wore it while cooking found it handy	1
i buy this baby wrap through e-bay because amazon would not ship outside us . my baby loves it , we flew dublin london both ways you would not know there baby flight , because she slept through whole journey . she just loves it , she falls asleep everytime i put her it . she just over 2 months old weighs nearly 11 pounds . it so comfortable , i actually went 1 mile walk her other day not feel strain my shoulders . i tried other baby carriers , regular ones like hell , luckily i only borrowed it not bought one , it dug into my shoulders left me aching day . wrap soft , it keeps baby warm winter cool summer it made out cotton lycra . most importantly it comfortable wear both mum/dad baby . highly recommended ! i usually don't write reviews but i just mention something wrap because i'm absolutely over moon it . way it really easy put , it only took me couple minutes get hang it	1
these new wide neck dr browns great updated version skinny original bottles . i like nipple shape much better , it easy transition breast this bottle . very easy clean well	1
i owned two these warmers 5 years now -- they consistently plugged they still working !! these gadgets make it so much easier pull wipes out when you need them , they also nice warm baby . i love fact you use any type baby wipe them , if wipes happen dry out you add ordinary water warmer rehydrate them . excellent investment !	1
when i my oldest , i not this product . he often got upset when changed which resulted him crying . it always took while calm him down . i recieved this gift pleasently suprised . my wipes never turn brown or dry out long i use thick wipe such huggies wipes . my son tooshie stays warm it also wipes off easier . result your child staying calm happy . i think it works billion times better than holding it your hand who wants hold them your hand warm when so often you need one right after . i think it not luxery , but necessity	1
i enjoyed this my baby . but they grow out this rather quickly .	-1
when we brought our daughter home all we one those tiny little head supports . well she only 6lbs birth it wasn't very good support her . freind bought this her we love it . i don't worry her sliding around her carseat all . it kinda hugs them . she snug bug there . i love this would recommend this everyone bring their newborn home	1
we got this our son when he 5 months because going out restrauants getting too much . it lasted all way up year half . this model ferris-wheel design . it contains hologram fish scene , rattle , touch feel fabric around ball , fish toy . it come off easily doesn't pivot like rocking-horse model but hold baby interest . put this together bunch others time eat actually get things	-1
love this gate - we 2 blocking stairs kitchen . one comment installation - you must use measure tape/ruler they provide locate where gate hinges fastened wall , that why top pop out ( earlier review ) . eyeballing it not way fasten it . there specific heights install make this gate safe . purchasing one top stairs well , no doubt it fine . they provide good long screws , so long you banister or stud , you'll fine .	1
i loved this gate so much , i bought two . i use one mounted wall other tension mount without hardware , either way , they both work great keeping our little monster off stairs . highly recommended	1
bumper useful prevents our son getting his arms legs through crib slats regular basis while providing breathable barrier case he rolls over his face against bumper . my only complaint it slides down fairly easily , especially when baby gets his leg top it ( while laying his side , not standing ) or grabs it . it needs readjusted tightened frequently . nevertheless , we sleep better knowing he doesn't his face thick quilted bumper . it really beathable- i put my own nose mouth it before installation check	-1
i somewhat hesitant purchase after reading review describing how seat would become loose or could not secured tightly . but , other reviews seemed positive so i decided give it try . i not any problems . i able secure seat very tightly no movement all .	-1

i bought this item when it sale only eight dollars change although it mostly bad reviews low star rating . i live approx . 1900 sq foot home one end other it picked up almost no static what so ever . price i payed it gets job well	-1
this tub worth every penny ! it large , but i keep it under crib where it out way easily accessed . best thing this tub how it holds small baby place while you bathe him or her . my baby 4 weeks old but i'm sure i'll continue like it he grows	1
we purchased this anticipation our trip yellowstone next year . pack very comfortable when adjusted correctly . i find if you adjust it right , most weight placed your hips . our 9 month old girl loves ride it . she even fell asleep once . she seems like rhythm our walk even " sings " she gets bounced around . we worried she wouldnt like it because she pretty difficult baby ( she born acid reflux ) . however , we it several months now she makes no complaint when we load her up . she doesnt even mind sitting pack when it ground . i very short hair baby likes try grab it ( too short really grab ) . interesting enough , she never tries grab my wife hair . i would suppose you may want invest hat if your baby likes pull hair . there lots pockets , although if you wearing pack , pockets very difficult access , even ones hip . hip pockets seem too far back ( i 38 " waist ) . my wife smaller waist doesnt seem problem waist pockets i . when taking off pack , baby seemed secure getting her off no problem . we dont use hood . its not too difficult put . just takes little time figure it out . i am 5'10 " waist belt near lowest setting just right me . my wife 5'7 " she likes waist belt setting near middle-top . first , it felt awkward walking weight , but after couple walks , we got used it . now we fight who gets wear pack when we walk . im glad we got pack . we cant wait till we get load her up yellowstone	1
i got four these sleepsacks , two fleece two cotton . i found fleece sleepsacks get bitty after couple washes , but it didn't effect product . they wonderful . if you buying newborn , get 6-12 month size , since it'll last bit longer . i ended up giving away 0-6 month size , when my baby only 3 months old , it getting bit small .	1
like any parent , i concerned sids so sleepsack seemed like perfect alternative blankets . little i know , i would come love sleepsack it warming capabilities . after few months under their belt , babies get very squirmy middle night , so blankets useless ( dangerous ) . so i relied heavily sleepsacks keep my little guy warm , even after risk sids passed . they come fleece winter months cotton warmer months , they're generous size , so they not outgrown easily . i only wish i'd purchased them yellow or white , case my next baby opposite sex	1
i love this breast pump . i only wish i bought it sooner . i bought cheap breast pump first , but it broke down after only month use . due daycare issues , i leave my son my parents week , so i pump exclusively . after second day cheap pump , my milk production cut half 3 oz total both sides every 3 hours . then i wait longer even get much ! i went out bought this pump out desperation couldn't happier . it took me 4 pumping sessions my body get into rhythm , but then it great . i started pumping more milk less time than cheap pump . now i use pump 2-3 times day work occasionally weekends . couple tips : if you larger breasts , buy larger shields . i am cup 27 mm shields perfect me . soon i switched larger shields , minor discomfort i pumping went away i started getting ounce milk out each side same amount time . also , use dual function , turn pump before you put shields your breast . i've doing i haven't problem positioning them correctly pump . i've never problem cleaning pieces . i make sure give pieces really good washing once day , but each pumping , i wash everything quick soap my hand let it dry . i've never problem pieces not drying time before next pumping . also , when i bought my pump , they included extra set membranes . you also buy microwave sterilization bags medela clean everything , including membranes , which can't go dishwasher . also , since pump works any bottle , you don't continually wash one bottle use pump . i just stick nipples bottles i pumped take them daycare , then grab next set clean bottles out cabinet next day . i must say , this pump saved my milk supply . i even freezer full extra breastmilk . even though it much more expensive than some other pumps , i've saved more than its cost formula , so it worth it financially , not mention extra benefits breastmilk my son continued . i plan keeping mine my next child i would definitely recommend this product other moms	1
this pump works great me working mom . it looks professional i even fit my lunch top . i also love how quickly i set it up my office pump . it bit loud so don't try use it conference calls unless you hide it under you desk close flap . even then you'll want check it friend listening phone it first . our battery pack didn't work first we didn't check it until we road , so check yours . white membranes also must kept very clean yellow tips they go . even little bit old milk completely kill suction . but it worth it even this issue . buy it your lactation nurse hospital then you someone give you guidance how use it deal any issues you parts . although you shouldn't many .	1
4-1/2 stars !!! i would given it full 5 stars if it fit my toilet better . i kind slide-cram it into place , but it sturdy flexible enough take it(thank goodness ) . it definetly taken some hassel out potty training . it already there just flip down just easy clean i'm cleaning rest toilet . i would fully reccomend this gift any house children frequent !	-1
this product wonderful . i love fact it all attatched cannot fall off when baby kicks . only dislike i top sometimes blows off baby face when it windy . wouldn't so bad if i extra hand hold it down , but i also 2yr old . i wish there some way it staying down it own	-1
my friend recent mom , she so busy sometimes she no time clean bottles . her favor got her pack , but you still go through these one day	1
our baby only 5 days old , but so far it good carseat . i like colors design . it seems safe easy use	1
first time our son saw this toy he loved it . it made it much easier transition him crib his bassinette . it would nice if ocean sounds would play longer , like music , but john really enjoys music .	1
i used lots different bottles my two kids . these bottles far very best venting keep air minimum babies tummy . yes , they pain wash but after switching evenflo glass bottles due plastic bottle scare currently news i tons problems evenflo nipples . i bought three different packages all least one defective nipple package ( they not venting nipple collapes- supposedly they designed not this ) . evenflo supposed sending me one replacement package but it still hasnt arrived ! i havent told them yet two more packages nipples also contain defective nipples . all pains nipples collapsing while using glass bottles evenflo i think i would rather just go through pain washing dr browns ( our pediatrician said she no concerns plastic bottle scares ) . i never problem before nipples collapsing dr browns or avent bottles i used . stay away evenflo their quality assurance department not even close dr browns	1
these best bottles i tried yet . thing makes them unique they really prevent air bubbles coming better than any other bottle we've tried . only negative i see there several pieces which makes washing bit nuissance - still , it worth it if you patience wash day !	-1
it easier keep sheet clean than try keep cleaning cushion pack ' play . i'll admit workmanship this sheet isn't top notch , but it serves its purpose . if i interested sewing , i could make one looks just good this one , but i don't/won't sew . got second sheet pack ' play grandma house . gotta sheet	-1

this third one we've purchased . all child safety gates we've seen , this seems sturdiest bunch . we've using them 2 1/2 years very satisfied . trick align closing point so it latch when you swing gate closed . if its not aligned , gate bounce back .	1
i love this gate/gate extension . this best one i've ever used . i've through nieces , nephews , step-nephews , now great nephew all gates used our families this far best one . it convenient very sturdy . you cannot go wrong this product . this last very long time	1
we bought two these extensions hands free gate we use our triplets just turned year old . this gate including extensions lifesaver ! you read my review gate well , lol . extensions very easy add very sturday . adding them not make gate weaker extending it out like some gates . it just what it states , extension . it keeps it just strong sturdy ! worth money	1

product exactly decsribed , quality materials , fits perfect , what child doen't want rubber ducky tub area	1
this tub fabulous ! we love it just simple ... no bells whistles ... just great sturdy tub . it folds up so not take up much room when stored , opening bottom drain water out , fits great kitchen sink holds baby great position bathing . we use it one those yellow bear spongy thingies , baby supported , semi-reclined very , very comfy ! worth every penny	1
i love this product . i've ep-ing my preemie 6+ months now kept my sanity because this product . i've tried other hands free methods like using my nursing bra flap keep it place ( doesn't work me ) easy expressions bustier which lot people love , but i didn't because it compressed my rib cage made my back ache . not pleasant experience . you need medela nursing bra , but i love their bras too	1
i'm not big fan giving pharmeceuticals infants , but this line somewhat ' natural ' or homeopathic you get commercial stores . i used gas drops religously both my kids it really helped what i call ' colic ' . i also use nose suction fingernail clippers -- theirs best what i could find . i give this warning : if you buying person , make sure you check expiration date . if their baby not due while , you better get one later expiration date . this happened me , bru one expiration date two months ahead , so there no way person i bought if could keep it . i felt bad b/c i didn't notice it while i store , new parent , i'm sure it challenge them return it before they needed use it . just warning	1
after doing our pre-baby research , we registered received this set . we started using it no problems , then my daughter started problems gas . naturally , we blamed it bottles . many bottles wasted dollars later , we returned premium nursers never looked back . fact , more i watch other moms other bottles , happier i am . sure , you spend few extra bucks liners . but time energy dishwasher costs you save well worth it . we 4 bottle shells we use 10 nipples . shells rarely get dirty so rarely washed . likewise rings caps . we usually run load nipples dishwasher every day that it . empty liners pop out no mess recyclable boot . when we go out , i pack 1 pre-assembled bottle , extra liner nipple/ring/cap setup . it weighs nothing takes up way less space than multiple bottles . fly i just pop out dirty liner , throw it away , pop new one screw new top . added bonus - i think my husband may actually invented this ingenius use premium nurser . note : this only playtex brand liners , not generics . when my daughter struggling swallowing too much air , my husband figured out we could fill liner desired amount milk , screw nipple , then squeeze all air out liner , collapsing it down until it vacuum-tight only milk it . keeping finger over nipple hole , pop airtight cap . voila - completely air-free meal baby . this really helped cut back her air swallowing . generic liners work fine all other purposes . last but not least , we like so many other parents , felt many brands drowning our daughter milk . playtex slow- flow nipples worked great her . she still using them 4 months	1
buy more stack higher if you need capacity . takes up less counter space this way . sturdy well designed . comes extender feet so you short or tall levels when stacking . easily unstacks ease loading bottle parts .	1
i've using big bundle me my 28 month old since he 16 months , haven't any trouble getting him fit it comfortably . we use all time when we go out , he loves it . it works great jogger stroller	1
i not use these warming food . i try once it just pain . i purchased bowls because they divided stick high chair . so they great , but i would not recommend getting it if you just looking warming dish	1
we received this today when i showed it my 7 month old , it brought huge grin his face squeal delight ! this adorable toy so bright eye catching , delightful vanilla scent . horn noises tentacles make also bring huge smile my sons face fun experiment different tones song producing sounds . i am ordering 2 more baby gifts friend family member !	1
i bought this booster replace our graco turbobooster because i drive jeep cherokee sport w/ very low back bucket seat ( no headrests either ) . i feel my daughter ( 5 yrs . old ) more support because whole back raises height adjustment ( not just headrest ) . i've also heard compass replace our booster seat if we accident . we both very happy .	1
when trying decide what we needed didn't need our daughter , i knew we needed something contain diapers . we no desire trek out trash every change ( especially those first weeks all hours day night ! ) . basically me it came down diaper genie or diaper dekor . i considered price refills , reviews , advice friend who works daycare went diaper dekor . we love it !!! it wonderful job refills lasted longer than i would ever imagined . dekor came one fill- we've not gone through entire box refills yet . our daughter 7 months old now , she eating solids some those diapers pretty nasty . however , quick change drop into dekor no more smell . plus , it just easy toss wipes other related trash items instead wasting refills or tracking it through house . only time we've ever smell -- when we've it open inner doors open put diaper . soon it closes -- no more smell . those who swear their diaper genies -- i don't think it accident recent redesign dg basically resembles dd design function . i personally think we'll get lot more use out dd down line . i highly recommend diaper dekor your nursery !!	1
i used diaper genie my last child it horrid ! this diaper dekor wondeful must product ! i would recomend it every parent looking disposal system . there really no diaper smells , it holds tons diapers easy use . get this my husband changes bag me well using it dispose diapers . i mainly chose it due great reviews , believe them this best system out there . i hear bigger one great too , i bought this smaller model due limited space my house figured it would add nicely my bathroom once baby out diapers	1
this fits all my strollers plus if you live rainy area	-1
this really handy mini electric pump i . i pump straight into bottles . i just use bottle occasionally so this item works great me . nipples fast flow so first time i fed my baby , milk flow too fast . i just picked up geber nuk slow flow nipples it perfect my baby .	-1
our toddler recently moved into " big boy " bed falling out bed numerous times night . we originally bought single bed rail but found we needed double sided bed rail because we can't his bed against wall because he kicks wall wakes us up throughout night . i actually like positioning double rail better than single because it clamps onto bottom mattress rather than top which leave more room bed . it easy change sheets because rails drop down . last part assembling sides fabric ( getting screws correct place ) little difficult , probably easier two people but other than , very easy assemble . we very pleased this purchase	1
not great lay your infant inside , but ok if you leave it closed slide it under baby extra support . you can't let go your baby this way , but it works great when your baby already fallen asleep you need something support their weight . if you carrying your child your hip , you could slip it under their heiny support their weight . it quick fix tired arms but , it doesn't free you up completely	-1
my daughter 3 we working hard potty training ! i got this gift when i pregnant i love it ! there occasional smell i noticed if i let bag fill up too much . but simple just empty it more often . i like refill bags last long time . i admit i sometimes put poopy diapers inside bag before i put it daiper pail ( just make sure it won't smell . 3 threes i it i only brought 5 refill packages comparism diaper genie nothing . refill packages little pricey ( my local toys us sells 9.95 box)but it worth it like i said , they last ! my daughter knows take her pull up off when it bath time she throws it dekor diaper pail without touching anything . i wouldn't want diaper genie where i change something every other day-i dump mine out once week-love it	-1
evenflo whisper connect 900mhz 2-way nursery monitor our second whisper conect monitor . compared already good one way 900mhz model this one even more sensitive , lower noise level , longer lasting rechargeable nimh batteries 2 way mode save you lot walking if your child only needs hear your voice . strong recomendation	1
i'm so happy this item ! even though my son almost three this our first baby monitor . i lot research finally purchased this one because it could used walkie-talkie , rechargeable batteries , large range . we big yard so freedom nice . it works well little feedback .	1
this fleece blanket matches zanzibar set . it really soft great edition this line . i love it	1
these so soft cushy my sweet darling face . they great cold weather too ! i suggest getting them early help head support well but my daughter now 5 months old i just love them comfort warmth	1
i think these awesome ! must newborns ! i just my 5th child wish i found these earlier ! i didn't use this long , first month . but it made things so much easier i think it worth every penny ! one thing i really like you keep top closed holding their arms close while you change their diapers . they seem not mind their diapers changed much this way . they also nice because they stay tightly swaddled unlike recieving blankets loosen move around	1
i * love * this product . it far better velcro swaddler than other brands because it uses bigger patches velcro . comparison blanket , this much easier use provides much more durable swaddles . i'm quite good blanket , but six weeks age , my son could wriggle out . other hand , three months , he never wriggled out cotton flannel swaddleme . however , even cold weather , microfleece too hot . several times i've felt under blanket find my son sweaty . it even worse when we combine swaddle sling . other hand , cotton knit ( solid colors ) blankets too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit swaddleme into toga , leaving both arms flying free . cotton flannel ( gingham prints ) less stretch than other two fabrics , plenty enough cover keep baby warm indoor temperatures . it trickier find , but worth search . microfleece swaddleme , however , make great non-swaddle blanket cold days , particularly when baby front carrier . velcro quite versatile .	-1
i used this my recent trip alaska new zealand . pack extremely helpful navigating through airport well boarding plane .	1
i purchased these par t-t ime preschool program although they easy use , they not durable i'd like them . however , we continue purchase them because price convenience	-1
our little boy too . he cuddles right up against you falls asleep month old , carrier so comfortable .. we tried several babies us then bought this one . you won't dissappointed	1
this carrier very easy use without additional adult help . straps soft , easy adjust it simple clean ( lots slobber my son chewing flap when forward facing ) . my lower back begins hurt after hour this but i can't imagine any front carrier going feel all good after long . i am not rating this 5 simply because it expensive . i would recommend trying few more inexpensive brands if price issue	-1
i'm very please this product . my son unable re-organize bookshelves , dvd , vhs all other things his not suppose touch .	1
this good choice . only thing it not suitable 2 1/2 yr old kid . they already climb out this gate . but i still like this	-1
my friend i purchased this item go pack ' play sand dollar our friend baby shower . i got this my daughter when she expecting my grandson almost 7 years ago . it used daily when my granddaughter arrived , she used it . my daughter lent these items friends when they travel she used it visitors small children . i know first hand excellence these product	1
i purchased two these gates , one top stairs bottom stairs . it simple adult use , but tricky enough toddler not open it independently . unlike other swing gates , this gate not any parts run floor . i heard complaints adults children tripping over " threshold " some other gates , so i think this better design . nice feature this gate made out wood . my favorite feature price ! i only paid $35 , while many similar gates sell $100 . i cannot give this product 5 stars , because it little difficult install properly . you must precise or latch not line up . once you it place , it wonderful gate	-1
i can't say enough good things this jogger ! it become our " everyday " stroller ! my 18 month old always " arms " baby . i wear him slings , even now 24 pounds . but , he loves this ride ! swivel-wheel front makes it super-easy maneuver , turn , steer . i often see parents older-model bob ( pre-swivel ) they make awkward turns rolling their joggers onto back wheels . what pain ! i'm so glad i got revolution ! ours " mesa orange " color , but i think it reminds me tomato soup , reddish orange , not too bright . it reclines enough my son nap , flap so i look him . only thing i would change basket bottom hard access when my son jogger . also , if there some sort ipod attachment/pocket would huge plus ! ( like jeep stroller ) but , i purchased some folding speakers , used velcro seucure them ( temporarily ) canopy . now we tunes our walks ! i use my console ( purchased seperately ) hold my cell phone , keys , ipod , sippy cup water bottle . love bob !	1
my wife i love our revolution . it so easy lock or unlock front wheel stability or manuverability . it light tough , folds up fairly compactly ease . i haven't tried many other joggers , but couldn't happier bob	1
we've this swing three summers ( we take it down winter)and it still works great . tray nice keep older kids off this swing theres three point safety strap we use once girls got old enough try stand or climb out . seat reclines little when girls real young . holes bottom swing means no standing water after it rains . we love it	1

i bought this stroller , because i really hate using them , packing/unpacking storage there such . ( i prefer carry my son baby bjorn , backpack when he gets bigger . ) this stroller light folds down nicely . even fits trunk my g35 coupe , which barely classifies trunk . i use it my son peg perego carseat . it not something you would take trail or jog doesn't alot storage ; but going walks , using mall such applications it work well . ht	-1
i'm writing this review tell other potential buyers this " universal " car seat carrier not technically fit baby trend snug ride infant car seat ( great product ) . description listed this web site states it . instead returning it , my crafty husband made few his own alterations keep our baby girl safe . ultimately , i looking universal car seat carrier black and/or gray instead navy blue , this what i found . despite feeling misled , i'm rating this carrier four stars because it serves its purpose very well , especially those who infant seat actually compatible . my only other complaint basket difficult access	-1
i love table toppers . we currently live asia travel all over world . we've used them japan , china usa . food gets spilled off plates , dumped tables plopped little kids mouths . table toppers we know surface they eating off isn't filled germs . my daughters like rip them off table occasionally , but we found trick fasten edge close them over edge table wait put them down until right before food arrives , way they more focused food than placemat	1
this very cute . it could tad bigger , but it perfect not find pacifiers bottom diaper bag or purse . it looks nice outside my diaper bag ! i fit 2-3 pacifiers mine	-1
i using this pump since my daughter born 7 weeks ago . it very easy comfortable use , works very quickly . i highly reccomend this pump anyone who plans pump regular basis	1
embrace extremely comfortable . my wife loved it when compared friend medela . one complaint though .... it pump little slower then other pumps ..... but extra comfort well worth it ! playtex awesome customer support . my wife accidently tore one her valves ( little white points fit under each cup ) . she called playtex they immediately fed exed her 4 replcement valves free . they only asked we return torn valve(s ) rd . careful valves they bit fragile if you tear one it adversely affects suction cup .	1
i love this pump . i've tried medela hospital grade pumps this far most comfortable pump ever . i'm proud mom almost 5 month old twin girls i used hospital pump which got me bleeding second day . problem , flangies too small me they didn't anything larger . embrace right size me after getting home hospital 3rd day i married my pump 24/7 . we latching problems so i never able fully nurse my babies , but embrace i'm still going strong after 5 months pump 50-60oz/day . i no problems my pump , no motor failures , no tube problems , nothing . i've pumpped it like i said , almost 5 months average 5 times day . it may bit noisy ... my husband calls it respirator :) but i would not switch my pump medela or any other anything . i'm sorry some you bad experience your embrace , not everybody body made same not every manufacturing lot same , i'm sure . this pump life saver me my girls i no plans stopping pumping . i started 4oz bottles came system eventually graduated pumping into dr. brown 8oz bottles . i love fact i pump directly both narrow widemouth bottles . i've never cleaned my pump nor bottles dishwasher , but wash them hand . i started working when my girls 9 weeks old , so i guess i called wahm ( i'm web developer work home ) i didn't notice any drop supply during work day compared weekend . worth every cent ! try , compare ... not every medela user happy their pump either . there no product out there going satisfy everybody . embrace just better	1

we used this play mat before our baby eating solids . he liked looking colorful images it kept his drool off carpet . we moved it under his highchair when he started eating it helps keep baby staining carpet . i wish it bigger though , so it would protect larger area . i wish it thicker . since our dining room carpeted , wheels highchair push mat into carpet stretch it bit . this leaves crescent-shaped bumps or indentations mat . overall it good product , especially price	-1

check see if crib or play-yard you intend this actually work it . when mine didn't , i decided attach it ( secure safe ) my headboard . curious reports it not loud enough , i laid down listen . it plenty loud enough , even distance 2.5 feet overhead . remember , your infant hasn't spent time front speakers counting crows concert ! when baby ( 9 weeks old ) finally got shot it , he enchanted , stimulated , very excited . so much soothing -- but it wonderful know while i'm fold laundry he watching bright colors listening lovely music . great addition day baby ..	-1

this great activity our little girl first few months . pillow really helped her lift her head way up check out world , toys fun manipulate . she still plays crab 8 months . unfortunately , our cat really liked water-filled fish pillow , so he chewed hole it . i figure that my fault not putting toy away night ... our baby still enjoyed toy without water	-1
this only way we could get our newborn tummy time . flat his stomach when he couldn't hardly raise his head all just freaked him out he'd cry cry . but little raised pillow , it would keep him his face smoshed into floor he'd more patient trying look around . now he 4 months able lift his own head fine he doesn't really need extra booster pillow , he didn't start playing water bit until 3 months . plus velcro one toy links wouldn't hold . but little attached toys very nice - we made belt his infant carrier put them there where he plays them all time . but i think it very nice baby they learn head control so it lifts them bit off ground so they don't panic much	-1
i finally got smart 3rd child bought these gates ( 3 them ) instead those kind you push down lock into place they fall over , these gates so secure really tall , my cats hard time jumping over them . my friend this gate also 80 pound dog he hasn't able budge it . we really big doorway our hall living room we able use 2 bigger 10 " extenders it fit perfectly . each gate comes 5 " 10 " extender . i would highly recommend these gates	1

this my second first years warmer my second child . first one got tons use lasted whole first year heating up bottles my son . now child , i decided i splurge new one since bottom starting burn out bit . i highly recommend it . bottles warm minute very easy . it all easy while holding baby one hand too . only negative i see if i've yet master how much water throw . it works putting small amount water right into unit then it heats up essentially steaming bottle so it even warming process . problem most likely me because i never pay attention how much water i'm putting note future if it right or not . but worst case i little more second time , or give minute cool down . usually it perfect . all choices out there , i highly recommend this one .	1

this exersaucer many great aspects . there many toys entertainment if your child gets bored toys came system , switch-a-roo bought mix things up . our daughter this since she 3 months old 5 months loves it even more . she loves frog string because she easily " mouth " it . there learning music two three electronic toys volume control all . we use arch solely floor play home away home because they difficult reach when attached exersaucer earlier age . not sure how toddler station entertain yet ; but infant , this toy great . cost expensive , but when you add up variations , it well worth cost . system collapse but still bulky heavy move around . system little time consuming assemble but aren't our little ones worth it ?! same time we bought stationary bouncer because our daughter loved bounce when we held her . however , we found she stays entertained this exersaucer longer seems enjoy it better now . i highly recommend this product child learn entertain themselves ( which builds imagination better attention spans ... gives mom/dad moment clean bottle or two ) great tool interact your child you sit floor ( eye contact communication reinforces learning toys )	1

we purchased this desparation because our son lot colic outbursts we hoped previous reports correct . although it doesn't always work calm him , it helps 2 out 5 times which better than before , he even falls asleep it occasionally - something he only previously our arms . so we it 2 months long i put some white noise , his non-fussy modes , he generally go sleep 1/2 hour ! there 2 things i would change - 1 . straps pain work , newborn they aren't really necessary since he doesn't yet move much . i always put blanket fully reclined seat soften feel straps his back ( i don't use them yet ) . 2 . white pastic bar pain use , it takes lot snap it down unhook it when he crying , so i just took it off ( which took some work after installing it ) . now i grab him easily when he wakes up fussy . all all i am very please it - he loves looking hanging animals over his head sounds work magic .	-1
i am first time mom 6 week old colicy baby who usually up fussy around 10pm 2am . my sister gave us old graco swing saying it would absolute lifesaver . my daughter ended up hating it . i hated it too because it didn't recline enough support her neck , plus it wasn't very sturdy . so i took her babies us , where you try different swings out . luckily she very fussy time , even my arms . she kinda liked nature touch swing but it 40$ more took 4 batteries 100 hours continuous use . then i saw almost all them took 4 batteries 100 hours . then i put her baby einstein swing i am not kidding , she got quiet happy . she loved sound effects flashing lights tray . it also harness seat belt reclined enough so she could fall asleep without her head bobbling around . i also noticed it took only 3 batteries 200 hours continuous use ! there family shopping baby swings time when they saw how happy she got swing they decided buy it too . night she honestly slept around 10pm 2am . i actually got nervous because she sleeping so long woke her up ! oh , i also love how sturdy it it easily folds down store away or move around . it best swing babies us . or least my baby thinks so	1
this gift not myself . i understand receiver really likes i t.t hanks	1
we originally going get our 8 month old jumper you hang door . after reading some reviews injuries mishaps jumping into door frames , we firmly decided against researched floor models . we this jumperoo one 4 support poles base . square jumperoo didn't nearly many toys her discover it seemed take up much more space . we decided this jumperoo because it took up less room more toys only slightly more money . investment worth it just first 10 minutes fun ! when we first put her , she wasn't quite sure what make it just looked around toys grabbing them . after she realized ( first 2 minutes ) she could jump , she great joy . her face all smiles watching her kick her feet out while jumping us all rolling floor hysterically . toys she likes best ones spin she reaches parrot frog hang . tiger comes up when you push button seems pretty useless , color wheel . whole thing took us 10 minutes put together few minutes wash toys . remember not submerge electronic one put 3 aa batteries it . box not include batteries you'll need screwdriver remove battery cover . also , large spinning ball rainbow sticker sides if you don't dry right away , well , they'll start wrinkle . jumperoo fold up easier carrying/stowing but it not smooth transition . i don't see us doing it often however . i mentioned , entertainment adults got well worth cost initially . now , our baby girl great time bouncing it while strengthening her legs . she doesn't seem like jumping without audience but maybe she when she gets little older . don't wait get this , you won't regret it !	1
i large breasts - dd normally without added bonus milk . my son latched great first , but then got cold could not latch properly . he got lazy my milk supply very good refused open his mouth wide enough . needless say breastfeeding became torture . i almost point considering formula when i came across these . within just few hours wearing them , pain decreased . shells helped shape my nipples little better made it easier my son latch little effort . after full day use , pain become almost non-existant . i wish i bought these my daughter because i might able breastfeed her longer than just 9 months . these shells made breastfeeding wondeful bonding experience it meant . my son still little lazy latch , but he getting better opening his mouth wider now . first i discouraged thought needing sanitize them every night , but i bought microwave bottle sanitizer which makes sanitizing them breeze . i am very satisfied customer	1
when my parents bought base off our registry , they didn't understand why we'd need two bases one car seat . " can't you just move yours cars ? it not like you'll riding our car often " after we strapped second base into their car , they hardly ever removed it they relished opportunities pick up baby spur momen t.t hey disappointed when baby outgrew his snugride seat hoped i could find similar base system next size car seat . after watching me move his convertible seat back forth few times , they've decided install second larger seat their car avoid hassle . snugrider far more cost space-effective solution than 2 car seats , since base only installed once , people less familiar car seat still safely move baby out car repeatedly greatly lessened risk error	1
any diaper system stink if you don't empty it . this one works great . if you worried smell , you're probably not cleaning it out timely manner . who wants keep dirty diapers their baby room two days ?	1
this what i wanted our leather seats . carseat fits well very stable . only thing would make it better if back protector fits behind carseat little bit higher	1

we three children , ages 2 mos 3 years , we use this stroller all three . seats fold down flat enough , use seat belt head support , our infant just fine it . our 2 year 3 year old love it because they sit side side talk , share snacks , etc . only problem we it , 18 mos worth serious wear tear ( i.e. dozen plane trips , two vacations , weekly use zoo ) , clip holds it together when folded gotten warped so sometimes pops off . cure ? we wrap luggage strap around it when flying- rest time it no big deal . we actually double jogging stroller ( which cost 3x much ) , while we loved it 2 mos ) , we haven't used since our second child 3 mos old . it big bulky , it much more difficult maneuver . jeep double umbrella stroller great	1
i bought this sleep sheep my son who 20-months time . he transitioning into big-boy bed . he loved bed , but wanted me stay him until he fell asleep . i bought this sheep hopes source comfort him , replace me ! it worked ! he loves it . only downside there only 2 sound settings he likes . heartbeart whale sounds little creepy . i would've liked few more options like birds or babbling brook . but we love rain ocean settings available . i say " we " because i find it very soothing too	-1
i skip hop dash black canvas absolutely love it . so , this just little added bonus get bag . it holds 2 size 2 gerber nuk pacifiers its snap strap attached just anything . we attach it our stroller so we clean pacifiers hand all times	-1
my newborn son would not take pacifier first three weeks his life . we tried many different brands ( advent , mam , etc . ) but unlike his older sister who took advent brand her second day her life , he not like it all . shape pacifier seems more natural breastfeed baby . i would strongly recommend this pacifier all mothers breastfeeding . we so thankful we found this pacifier , especially 2 morning !	-1
everyone tries tell you any breastpump any less than hospital grade not work if you going back work full time . but i found this one worked just fine , i could pump 15 minutes twice day , it worked great . i ended up not breastfeeding long i thought , i am very glad i didn't spend $200-$300 breastpump . this one still works great , i plan use it my next child . not everyone needs hospital grade pump , don't let people convince you . i gave it 4 because it little loud , but not too bad	-1
i've searching stroller met all my needs this it . i twins 10 months old i used 4 different strollers since they born . none them everything i needed until now . i needed something every day could fit my van i could also take beach . this stroller fits small space ( 19 " deep ) back my van without remove wheeles . it opens closes so quickly easily . you just unfold it it locks into place . closing just easy one hand . seats recline separately , front wheele swivle wonderful . i easily push this stroller one hand . i able get through all doors , but i say there couple places tight squeeze . there good basket under stroller but there bar above it so you can't put anything too big . i love it seat cushions you remove wash . it foot brake but no hand break so i'm not sure if this would good stroller serious joggers . it great find something make my life little easier	1

we originally wanted stroller/car seat combo , but we received this shower gift . we love it ! our infant graco snug ride carseat actually fits into stroller ( facing whomever pushing ) . my husband loves ipod connection , it works well best i tell . tires easy inflate , i able figure out air pump inflate tires out any instructions . i also find it lot storage capacity shopping . it not super easy steer one hand i sometimes when my baby wants out . stroller heavy lift out trunk it not fit all cars . it awkward lift stowe ( watch your fingers ) it takes up lot space . it collapse using one hand , but its not if you could it while holding your baby or anything else so it might well two handed ) also , i find it not best steering small isles stores , it tends get hung up . however , it ride over most terrain quietly little disturbance your little one . it two cup holders near handle , but i find they usually too small . i read once they designed fit starbucks cup -- my avent bottles not fit well nor bottles water . overall , i would recommend this stroller , its well priced , durable functional .	-1

i two these dishwasher baskets , but i not valve basket . they purchased separately some stores . i originally bought type dishwasher basket bottle nipple compartment top , but it much more difficult use . everytime you opened it add nipple , ones already there would fall out . these dishwasher baskets designed allot better . they nipple compartment bottom better cleaning slots bottle nipples fit into . best aspect , however , nipples not fall out when compartment opened	1
this gives 100% coverage - even covers all big costco cart . there loops holding toys little side pocket extras . my son loves ride cart chew things - this i don't worry he going chew cart . it also extremely easy put take off - i usually it one handed while holding my son . must !	1

super cute bed , but my husband i hard time putting it together . my daughter liked it 3 months now twin bed ... it great her baby dolls	-1

my baby mostly breastfed , but dad gives baby bottle night so i get few hours uninterupted sleep . baby loves this bottle it really keep air bubbles out milk . only downfall all parts putting them together . if i it over , i would tried playtex premium bottles drop ins	-1
i really like pattern this changing pad . it matchs up my diaper bag ; this only reason i bought it . i wish my diaper bag comes this changing pad so i don't spend extra money buy it . really i don't care pocket .	-1
when i began my research potty chair my son , i no idea how many things there consider ! i really didn't want anything made noise or lights but we ultimately decided this chair because one-piece splash guard since i learned it wasn't uncommon little boys hurt their tender bits other chairs . it well-made sturdy ; it didn't tip when my son got or off . i think main thing it give my son confidence use potty - his feet stayed securely ground it stable didn't slip around . he no problem getting himself off it he liked ' responsibility ' dumping contents into big potty ( i liked it easy him , easy me clean bowl afterward )	-1
these great diaper covers . they seemed huge first until i got hang them . they clean easily dry fast , no special washing required ! i think elastic feels rough , but my little one doesn't seem mind there no marks her legs them . these great diapers all kinds cloth , prefolded fitted diapers	-1
like most reviewers , i too like this bather . it much softer than plastic tubs folds fairly easy storage ( least it smaller store than plastic ones . ) however , my son little jaw chatters because he gets chilly because he so far out water . i fill my tub up high water , but angle chair doesn't allow him enough his body safely submerged . i think it would great warmer weather , but january february midwest cold . i also wish manufacturer would make washer bold underside plastic piece . it rusted my model too	-1
i given hand-me-down changing pad i used my 1st 2nd child but it really looking bad when baby #3 came , so i broke down bought this . i love it ! my covers fit snug but easily strap so nice hold baby few seconds while i grab something instead making one my other children stand beside baby keep her rolling ! my child also loves play strap it keeps her occupied during changes	1
i've stumped trying find something car my son use wouldn't bother my other two kids ( we lincoln town car , so it tight backseat ) this pillow our pillow salvation ! works perfectly , my son head doesn't loll around it narrow design keeps him his own personal space ! awesome !!!!!!!! i'm ordering adult version right now	1

i bought this border accessorize my froggy tales collection . it matches beautifully set . it little tricky hang . i found just adding water prepasted back not quite enough make it stick well . i added wallpaper paste it assure it adherance . i also liked it double roll covers 30 feet rather than standard 15 most wallpaper borders . it makes my froggy tales set complete	-1
my daughter just turned 1 year old . she tiny side so i concerned what type carseat i going purchase . i read many reviews britax it seemed like company go . i loved print this my daughter looks so cute it . not mention she finds it much easier fall asleep this seat than her infant carrier . my husband said it fairly easy install i know getting her out well adjusting straps breeze . it perfect buy i would recommendend anyone	1
i love this car seat , but more importantly , my 7-month old baby girl seems love it too . we switched her this seat when she 6 months old , car rides whole lot better . she plenty room it reclines better than her infant car seat ( graco snugride ) , it well padded . we call it princess ' throne . my husband shocked first how much this thing costs , but now he understands why . this so easy install very safe . i love latch system -- thing barely moves . you can't put price safety . plus this grow her until maybe she 5 . also , you cannot go wrong this beautiful fabric . i love it -- not pink , but very girlie sweet . i love it ! well worth $$	1
i just love this high chair so my 7 month old . it puts him right up table rest family . it easy attach table easy dettach it store . its easy fold up take it you .	1
this item works wonderful very easy clean . cover slips off thrown washer . i prefer this type high chair over larger free-standing ones . very convenient taken anywhere	1
shortly after i found out i pregnant our 2nd child , i bought swaddleme whim . i knew benefits swaddling newborn so our 1st child , swaddleme caught my attention its design overall ease properly swaddling baby . time , i didn't know exactly how handy this little blanket/wrap would . our baby now 2� weeks old this product become one most important baby items we own . our daughter fussy just couldn't seem settle down ... until i pulled out swaddleme wrapped her up it . instant change her personality unreal . she now happy content baby fussy crying all but stopped . only time she doesn't " wear " her swaddleme during diaper clothing changes her carseat - any other time day , she snuggly wrapped up . swaddling baby regular blanket bit tricky , but this specially-shaped wrap makes it super easy . velcro tabs ensure baby can't accidentally loosen wrap unswaddle him or herself . i highly recommend this wonderful blanket/wrap anyone who expecting or newborn baby	1
i purchased mini co-sleeper my first child . she slept it our bedside until she 6 months old . i really feel her beside me helped us all sleep better . if she woke up fussing , i could just reach over pat her , find her pacifier , etc . without get out bed walk nursery every time . often i could comfort her before she really got good awake/upset i could get her back sleep faster . 6months , she getting too large it , so i transitioned her her own crib nursery no problem . only drawback it not very easy fold up travel-i get my husband it me every time . but , i yet find portable crib very easy fold up ( we pack play too ) . when you get it folded up put into its carrying case , it doesn't take up much room . used co-sleeper parent bed or free-standing bassinet . overall , i pleased use it again my next baby	-1
so when my son got toddler stage , i worried how keep him warm his stroller . we live city , so travel stroller way life . he loves outside , but really dislikes covered up - you see source needing this product ! overall , we found this product very good - it machine washable , it warm my son ( 16 months time purchase ) , there room him grow into it bit this winter , it fits our maclaren quest stroller nicely , it attractive . only downsides we noted we wish it one zipper up middle , instead zipper up each side . reason this we think it would tougher our son get his hands out bag this way - he nothing short houdini-like , however , his ability get himself out outwear protective items like this bag , so it may not matter all . other thing not attach stroller securely we would like - it tendency slide down front , eventually , usually rainy day , bottom bag drags ground bit . however , going back fact it washable , this not huge complaint either . this may also function stroller which you trying use this . i would recommend this product anyone squirmy toddler who loves outside much my son	-1
my only complaint this potty topper concerns stick-in-place double sided tape . peel-off backing difficult remove tape out tearing potty topper . it takes bit time get off , if you toddler dancing around bathroom stall , doing pee-pee dance , you don't luxury lot time . also , when ' deed ' , it time remove potty seat cover , you again need very careful , or tape tear off cover , remain toilet seat . then you pick it off your fingernail - yuck ! i think ' post-it note ' kind stick-in-place would much better than double sided tape . seat cover doesn't need stick seat forever , just long enough my toddler tinkle . other than , this great . after my toddler finished , i used it too , found it very comfy . it cushiony , provided warm layer over cold toilet seat . i didn't worry anything leaking through , it seems water-proof . it large enough cover enitre seat , even those large public toilet seats . i continue use these , they provide layer protection i am looking , but i need extra careful tape , until something better comes market	-1
we bought this just travel purposes . couple years we've traveled extensively our big bulky stroller while great holding carry-ons , it pain move around . so this one fine what we use it : quick trips park , moving our two year old around airport toss back car just case we need it mall . it rough ride kind squashes him sides ( he now 31 pounds ) but like i said , it not our main stroller . i'm 5'5 " i find handles awkward height but my 5'11 " husband thinks it fine . we live ca so able fold up back little air circulation handy but not used so often . i would definitely recommend this if you need save money or need good quality cheap stroller	1
i already bought noah ark design this type display ; we keep it living room ( i reviewed display more detail ) . we purchased this one our son bedroom . i wish canvas came more colors than just red , but natural wood beautiful . it very easy put together - only took couple minutes . it sturdy , but light-weight . it holds all sizes books , hold anywhere 12 36 books depending their size shape . 1st guidecraft book display help us teach our son respect his books . he took such good care them ( like putting them back display instead throwing them floor ) , we able introduce paperbooks our 18 month-old , he doesn't try tear them apart . i think this type book display more practical children books than traditional bookshelf , due shapes sizes	1
few days after i got home hospital i thinking stopping breasfeed because my nipples so sore such pain ( even though baby latched just fine ) . these pads worked miracles ! put them refrigerator apply them your nipples right after feeding . you feel great ! these truly saved me . now baby 6 months old still breasfeeding ... i'm sooooo glad i not stop .... thanks these pads ( chamomile tea applications ) . they might bit pricey but very worth it !	1
what else i say ? fits my bugaboo perfectly never fails me	1
i got this pump hospital it work great me . i pump more milk this one than my electric pump . i used this one instead than my electric pump when watching tv . manual pump so you get work out using it . if you afford electric medela pump thats great , but if you don't need pump often this works great . very easy take you help times you engorge baby can't latch drink	1
i love this item baby only going take occasional bottle so mommy daddy date , etc . i use mine little differently . i put liner ( i use cheaper soft bags ) directly into bottle . then i screw collar pump adaptor . i pump directly into bottle then screw off adaptor screw lid ( nipple ring plug it ) . then when baby sitter goes feed baby , she not take off collar risk loosing bag milk . she just screws off top lid screws nipple ( using contrasting color nipple ring plug lid may help distinguish which part should unscrewed ) . ( this also solves problem milk raised above readings bottle . ) only thing i don't understand why they don't give you more plugs go lids . you wouldn't need lids if they would just give you plugs , you could put them rings go your bottles .... i know this confusing ; you kind need looking pieces understand what i'm talking . occasional bottling , 1 newborn gift set 1 breastmilk storage kit more than enough what i need . my babies definately take nurser nipple easier , so how i ended up this system . everything washes dishwasher , so clean up easy	1
i bought this product thinking it would work well other playtex bottles , nipples , etc . i already . it seems working out great . i pump using my medela pump right into storage receptacles then put them right into fridge . if i'm run one afternoon , i grab one go . it so easy even cleaning easy . only couple things wash you're . means lot me when you're constantly cleaning other things around house . i'm one very happy customer	1
this seat wonderful transition our daughter roundabout . reasons why i could not give it 5 stars following : poorly designed cup holders ; early tear fabric ; no secure anchoring . cup holders : we've already spilled juice that left cup holders . they completely useless should better designed . fabric : though material looks resilient , tear developed near lower left corner where her leg sits ... i am assuming this because chair mounted behind driver seat , therefore it gets lot traffic our daughter boards disembarks car - nonetheless , we expected something little more durable . anchors : seat wobbles around doesn't really hold our daughter place . she often reaching over pick something up , seat nearly topples over . i am not sure why this wasn't considered design . it makes it easy remove install , but i'd rather something little more stable	-1
i tried few boosters before settling britax parkway . first we tried jupiter booster . my daughter tiny girl ( 5yrs . old- 36 lbs . 43 inches tall ) . she way too tiny jupiter . shoulder belt kept sliding off her shoulder her head wasn't supported when she slept car . thing i didn't like jupiter padding under her bottom felt too thin she complained her bottom hurt after long car rides . then we tried graco . it good seat . but no head support unless you lay seat back ways . i didn't like plastic seat belt guides because it hurt my daughter cheek sleeping it . next we tried parkway ( britax ) . this booster far best booster market my opinion . i am huge britax fan . all my kids britax babies . my 3 year old 4 month old currently sit marathon ( britax ) . this booster enough padding keep kids comfortable , head rests keep their heads flopping . my daughter likes way fabric feels ( she very sensitive ) . even though graco booster seat looks like parkway , graco $50 less than parkway , i still didn't like fact red seat belt guides ( graco ) looked like they would hurt rest my head . britax thought everything this seat . i highly recommend this seat . fork over extra cash splurge your child safety !! you'll glad you	1
i shopped months find 3 1 good quality but wasnt pricey . we just moved our 7 month old son our bed this crib . he transitioned nicely . it arrived 1 day later than projected . it fairly easy put it together ( i it myself , my hubby mechanically challenged ) . i break plastic piece i assembled it . company sent replacement , free charge . i received replacement 4 days . only thing i could complain latching system , it works fine , but i feel they could better design	-1
when my baby 2wks old she developed excessive gas very cranky , she would not allow me put her down all . i bought 2oz dr. brown bottle fed her night . she not suffered excessive gas since much happier baby . i truly recommend dr brown bottles	1
our baby some problems gas when she very small , even though she nursing . when she took bottle , we started using these we notice difference . i imagine they're not quite convenient when mixing formula , since it says all over instructions not shake liquid bottles	-1
both my babies slept through after three weeks , i found myself sitting next them half night checking their breathing . so i got angelcare , only checked one night , found it worked ( it easily tested taking baby out , alarm goes off after 10 secs ) , peaceful nights ever after . happy recommend it everybody !!!	1
how many times night you go into your baby room make sure covers still them ? yeah , well , you stop doing now . just buy this . sack zips opposite direction so not catch baby skin . i must washed this thing trillion times it held up wonderfully . just put your baby his/her pajamas zip them up halo sleep sack . it doesn't look like much but it certainly keeps them warm ! i must pointed laughed my daughter good five minutes when i put her this first time . it looks pretty comical , but cute way . she also plenty room move her legs feet around . . . kind like mini sleeping bag stays put . i highly recommend this it makes excellent baby shower gift	1
we bought one these try out b/c our baby would kick covers off middle night we love house cold .. i worried b/c when i went check baby , he always freezing cold . so i went babies us found this ... you can't beat it .... everyone needs least 2 or 3 these little outfits ... we even bought it big so he wouldn't outgrow it ..!!! so i encourage you get least one ..	1

every since i found out i pregnant , i've dreading purchase diaper bag . according my friends , i carry ridiculously small purse mom ( i 12 y.o. already)--it really just cell phone holder one pocket slots cards zippered pocket cash . i knew those days over once my new baby arrives -- after all her big sis 3 before i stepped out house without huge diaper bag . but , same time , if my memory serves me well , bulky bag made hauling around baby her other gear , etc . daily basis even harder . so i thrilled when i saw this bag . it came mail today ( merchant ) like poster , i've trying it out . it fit decent amount gear i expect carry it -- few diapers , change baby clothing , etc . so far , it feels very comfortable . even when worn tandem premaxx new edition baby carrier i also bought . i post again once baby arrives give update this product	-1

excellent bibs . they cover large area , velcro lasts forever ( unlike others we've used ) , pouch bottom great , saves many spill .	1
when my daughter born i planned strictly breasfeed her first month least . however , complications jaudice forced us introduce bottle her 5th day life . avent system newborn nipple allowed us provide her both expressed breastmilk formula supplements ease . since then i've tried other bottles amp ; nipples . nothing compares gentle flow avent nipple which feeds her just right pace avoid gas spitting up later . we now use nothing but	1

we really like potty trainer but rubber feet inserts missin	-1
these fit all baby bottles not wide-neck , so i bought couple packs extra lids breast milk storage , formula mixing , travel . these work so much better than two-piece lids prevent leaks . my medela bottle lids cracked , so i used these replacement . none these sturdy lids cracked	1
this game extremely fun . i played it multiple groups different people game requested every time . fact , worst thing this game it addictive ! people who wanting head home party early find themselves staying " just one more round " over over . i also played non-electronic catch phrase it fun well . it also cheaper . either way , this game rocks . it same lines taboo , just more fun . i highly recommend this game	1
this product really wonderful when traveling airplane . it just hooks your carry luggage wheels child sits right it you stroll through airport . so many people made comments it i walked through airports while traveling . they thought it neatest thing . i 6 months pregnant when i first used it it great not lug big stroller around i less things take me . i gave it 4 stars only because it take short time hook/unhook it every time you get or off plane . i pull side keep my daughter me while i hooked seat back luggage . but other then it one piece nylon not huge stroller i take anyday	-1
we one eddie bower seat this britax roundabout . it well worth extra cost roundabout . we knew britax car seats got great ratings , but we wish someone told us how much better they than other seats . it huge difference . we're considering throwing out other car seat getting second roundabout . bottom line : it easy use super comfortable our son .	1
i bought this car seat my daughter when she 4 months old . she now 2 years old it still perfect condition . straps never get tangled . it also so easy adjust straps . everything this car seat amazing . my mother law cosco i hate it . spend extra money it worth it .	1
i found this car seat much easier use instal than other car seats we used ( cosco alpha omega elite convertable . my daughter large her age it nice we able keep her seat rear facing position until she one year old . if you big baby ( over 9lb birth ) this your seat .	1
since our bedrooms upstairs it really convenient this product right same room . there no need go downstairs leave baby crying until you get her bottle ready . it takes some time using it get used right temperature since amount water it states use order heat up bottle sometimes not warm bottle enough or sometimes heats it up too much . i don't go amount water stated use each bottle size . regardless size bottle or amount milk it past 4 ozs , i fill vial water up 9-10 push button . time time i take bottle out check temp . once it way i want it , i just take it out , shake it , feed baby , letting rest water evaporate its own . this way i know i always warm bottle since once it turned shuts off , you wait 10 minutes warm it up again . who time patience crying baby tend ? overall , it great idea saved me many trips kitchen	1
we call him seizure dog because color scheme , frankly , almost nauseating grown-up eyes . but babies react this little guy like no other toy i've seen . it really first thing my daughter ever responded outside food people . she used fall asleep holding some part seizure dog anatomy would wake up playing one various dangly bits . high-contrast bright primary color scheme really draws infants ' eyes , especially generally ( appropriately ! ) sedate relaxing nurseries . we now buy seizure dogs all our friends babies . next one we get 6th one these we've purchased , so i'd say we highly recommend it	1
my 4 month old daughter loves this toy . bright colors textures great . pupsqueak keeps her busy . one best toys we purchased	1
i used these bottles supplement nursing last eight months . since liners steralized , all i wash nipples other parts very hot water let dry . these convenient easy use . try rubber nipples well bottle series solid color tops close down nipple - i like those best because they so compact .	1
while we preparing arrival our daughter , we hoping use these bottles because convenience , so when our pediatrician recommended them , decision made . these bottles wonderful !!! they don't scrubbed inside brush like one-piece bottles . we just throw them dishwasher they're . our daughter reflux , silicone slow-flow natural latch nipples work well her . our doctor ( other doctors same group ) says these best bottles cut down gas . i would highly recommend buying premium nursers ( featured here ) instead older original nursers slowly phased out . ( we some each . ) premium lids major improvement-they're easy pop off one-handed , unlike original lids you pry off your fingernails . you interchange all parts both systems ( use any holder any ring any nipple any lid ) , but i think premiums much better . also , premiums come silicone nipples , but originals usually don't . liners these nursers very inexpensive , especially if you use coupons come bottles or if you buy store brand liners ( they work just well ) . only downside this system there isn't much room top liner put full 4 ounces water plus powdered formula shake . but problem happen any bottle , i don't think it big deal . good news those who use these bottles ! i just discovered today you buy extra rings lids www.teebop.com . ( i got info . playtex over phone . ) i plan get some extra premium lids take place few original nurser system lids i ( make up ones i inevitably lose way ) .	1
this little gym kept my daughter busy exploring , touching , feeling , hearing new sounds . i would highly reccomend , fact i bought it all my friens who expecting	1
if there one thing you going buy your baby - buy this ! both my children went under it newborn . toys fascinating them watch mat nice soft lay . they grew they would bat toys make them swing grab them pull leg or tail into their mouths chewing . they learned make noises each toy makes . arches soft bendable so when they rolling around they move baby so there no risk getting caught up odd position . it portable , just folds half , so you take it you . it washes up extremely well . it just great toy !	1

this must moms who like keep their kids secure shopping cart , well clean yucky germs . my son small his age regular strap shopping cart doesn't fit around him corrrectly ... he 2 we still use it . i tried big cart cover covers entire seat he just swam it ... this keeps him secure safe . well away form germy , yucky cart handle . i also like this fits my diaper bag better than big full cover cart cover . must far !!!	1
easy install covers outlet entirely . other safety faceplates i tried never covered outlet completely my son could stick straightened paper clip through . not this one ! they very easy use adult well . :	1
i debating this avent pump since i nothing but avent bottles . end , babies us sold out avent i bought medela backpack adaptor set so you pump straight into avent bottles ( avent doesn't advertise this well ) . i'm so glad i . avent doesn't battery pack so i don't know how you'd use it trip unless you don't mind standing middle airport bathroom pumping . i , myself , prefer privacy stall . also , no one tell its breast pump . backpack very stylish i able fit additional items it so i could use it my only carry-on . design very innovative which you learn more you use . most importantly , i get 5 oz per breast out less than 10 minutes so you don't feel like you're waiting forever while pumping . i'd recommend this anybody	1
i read re-read reviews bottles found only way really find right bottle try them out ( no wonder this multi-billion dollar industry ) . we tried playtex drop-ins frustrated 6 weeks feedings taking hour slow nipples . fast nipples drenched our son formula . we moved avent stage 2 nipple found ourselves 50% people who can't get them shut properly . loved nipple shape speed , couldn't deal leaking . we tried playtex ventaire . although this bottle claims not let air through nipple , we apparently couldn't get these closed correctly either . air entered through nipple every feeding caused gas spit-up problems . we eventually made our way back drop-ins , our son now old enough handle fast nipple , we like these best . i still feel reviews beneficial , but know your kid let you know if he or she needs change . find what works you go it . i give drop-ins 4 stars . if playtex would put out medium flow nipple , it would 5	-1
i bought these bottles when i knew my son would away me need get breast milk bottle . he no problems going my nipple these i liked you could get all air out bottle . now my son formula i find it difficult prepare it these bottles . it almost easier put it seperate cup mix water formula . it it bottle but it little difficult mix it well . i now mastered how put formula how long shake it but it took some practice get it right without formula clumping lot . warming bottles also problem since you cannot microwave liners ( or so it says ) my mother it once without realizing you aren't supposed nothing bad happened but since it advises against it , i wouldn't recommended trying it out . now my son doesn't really care warm milk it isn't issue anymore anyway . i still love these bottles fact if i enough nipples change out , i don't worry " clean " bottle hand since i just drop new liner . i currently 6 extra nipples case this happens but it hasn't yet but it nice know option there us .	-1
i love these bottles so my son . they really keep gas out . nipple great when you also breastfeeding , my son didnt seem notice difference . only problem though , measuring ... i'm fine now my son drinks regular milk , but when i mix formula it hard . you actually only mix 6 oz . formula 8 oz . bottles . what i ended up doing towards end when my son beginning drink 8 oz ., mix formula container or bottle then transfer it playtex . other than its great not wash bottles over over	-1
i not heard this product/brand until my 5th baby born . we doing " elimination communication " him this potty works well his first potty . currently ( he almost 4 o.o ld ) we set potty changing table hold him . safety reasons , we never let go him while sitting there . when he sit up his own , we sit potty floor . eventually he out grow it . we also purchased babybjorn potty trainer , eventually he'll use next . meantime next older child able use it . i like this potty all 1 piece . so easy clean ( no crevises worry ) . we dump contents into toilet . add little water , potty , sink ( potty easily fits into our bathroom sink catch rinse water ) dump rinse water into toilet . size nice storing ... it won't take up lot room . size nice because ( eventually when he older ) he'll able get off it easily himself . i would prefered this item white instead blue ... but time ordering color blue best option ( after additional item purchased my order , i also able qualify free shipping through amazon ) . colors available would not fault manufacturer but who i purchased it . i unable find this any stores my local area . we would drive 50 minutes or more away our home purchase it certain baby store . then we would also paid sales tax our costs drive there . i pleased this purchase through amazon	1
babybjorn it again . small portable , easy clean . great take when you leave house , so your child doesn't sit not so clean public toilet seat ..	1
i bought this booster seat after considering other seats cosco britax . this one stood out value , simplicity , safety , convenience . first , i considerd convertible booster seat also latch system 5 point seatbelts , but decided against it because my son his age weight ( 3.3 yrs , 35 lbs ) not need all these extra features extra bulky be-all car seat . latch 5 point features intended more recent 3 year old , while toddler 3.5 years 10 won't need it , so why bother all this extra stuff ? you don't need added bulk complexity features only used . 5 more years . b510 premier top line latest compass , which more durable fabric , wider side supports , carry bag . my son loved it first sight , it works great . there no neck support though , so you may need buy one these separately long road trips . my son literally propping his head up his arm arm rest when he passed out car . price b510 $[ ... ] free shipping , given free carry bag which retail value $[ ... ] , it makes this booster seat $[ ... ] , which price older b500 model . only thing i get over booster seats general not secured onto car seat latch , but instead , rely seat belt keep my son seat place . when driving around without kids , seats like this need secured even if child not sitting it . base this seat doesn't look like it'll rip into my car leather seat , headrest adjusts vertically easily . i need buy seat protector anyway though , since my son uses car seat step stool get into this booster seat . also , you need train your kids when they unbuckle seat belt because it easily reachable . only shocking thing me this seat comes expiration date , not recommended use after 7 years date manufacture . therefore , it not meant kept forever used hand me down siblings	1
these so awesome ! i never concern my son cold or get strangled blankets . one night i sleep sak laundry it cool night , so i put blanket over him - well my husband checked him middle night found blanket wrapped so tightly around his neck he could hardly believe our son still breathing . very scary . so if anything , make sure you more than one sleep sak .	1
i wondering same thing this stroller - i.e. how it convert " stand " mode ? etc . i seen version this stroller one step ahead website , so i called baby trend they told me it exact same stroller . it just marketed differently different vendors ... they different colors . so , you go one step ahead website get more views stroller . i still not purchased it yet , worried quality overall length stroller . but it seem one lightest double strollers available . good luck	-1
i 23 month old 6 week old initially thought joovy caboose would stroller us . thank goodness we opportunity try one out before we bought it ! joovy , if you infant carrier front seat , there no room all older child sit jump seat . also , some strange reason , jump seat slides back forth which seems very unsafe . so if you infant carrier your older child wants sit , older child out luck . what point ? this stroller , older child 3 options - sit back seat , sit jump seat or stand platform . back seat removed fairly easily stored basket underneath my little girl ( who tall her age ) plenty room . she sometimes dangles her feet over foot rest but this not issue . our infant carrier easily slides into front seat secured belt . this stroller opens closes easily very easy control it steers beautifully - it not nearly long i thought it would but both children plenty room . since it footprint single stroller , it fits through doors entranceways no problem . it little heavy when folded but i don't think i would find stroller these features that not . basket nearly impossible get but i live it . overall , i'm thrilled this purchase every single time i use it , someone stops me ask it . one woman even said , " that most practical double stroller i've ever seen . " i agree	1

this far nicest looking bottle drying rack i could find . i love it . i've never used brush , though , i use different one . others mentioned their brushes breaking , so i'm not sure how it holds up . easy take apart clean when needed	1
although this product isn't perfect , i really couldn't imagine traveling without it . pros : 1 . able hands free ( push stroller , hold child , or other luggage)while seat your back like backpack2 . travel case folds up small nicely - fit under plane seat3 . sturdy ( i didn't any issues rips/tears like some other reviewers)cons : 1 . it bit annoying trying get car seat it , but it fit2 . strap buckle dug into my shoulders ; tried adjust it , but wasn't able make it much better3 . carrier flips occasionally while stroll modeall all , definitely buy this product if you traveling child . i don't know better alternative i can't imagine able carry everything through airport without it !	-1

i am totally satisfied this carseat . it bit tricky getting it installed car ( i recommend reading instructions , extra set hands help you install it ) but all carseats bit tricky . my 7 month old son loves this carseat because it sits higher up than his first seat he see outside ( this makes our road trips much more pleasant ) . there lots places you adjust straps , buckle , headrest so you really make seat fit your baby . i am not sure how well it would work newborn because it doesn't recline far carseats only rear-facing , it might make it harder your little one take naps keep his head comfortable position . ( plus , it so nice carseat detachable base brand new baby so you don't wake them up when they sleeping ) . but if you only want one carseat , i am sure neck support pillow carseat would work great newborns . my favorite feature this carseat i won't keep buying more carseats ( then find place store old ones ) until my son old enough ride without one	1

these shells work really well early breastfeeding occasionally protect sore nipples . they also work increasing milk supply throughout day without added pumping . i use them collect milk opposite side during my nightly feedings , stored up lot milk way . only reason they got 4 stars because they kind hard sometimes feel kind obvious under certain clothing .	-1
i found them very comfotable my sore nipples . they also collect leaking milk ... but don't bend over they spill all over your feet ( my first try ) . other than this wear loose shirt hide them , i use them everyday instead pads get wet irritate my nipples .	-1
i got this gift when my second child born i absolutely lvoe it ! my children year apart both very comfortable it . ride magnigicent ! we hit bump kids don't even notice it . it provides excellent sun protection wonderfully deep canapee . i would recomend this anyone who needs double stroller . then only drawback , it small tht it not portable . it doesn't fit trunk our car . but other then it great stroller !	1
this dish great those parents go need take baby meal them . snap cover good it all dishwasher safe	1
after throwing my first years crib cd player literally trash ( don't get me started what complete hunk junk thing ) , i search replace it . when i came across icrib . you really can't beat price - i'm guessing it reasonable since most controlling ipod itself . granted i only it few days , i cannot rave enough it ! it mounted perfectly crib i think sound fantastic ( i only tried classical not music lyrics so i cannot comment sound quality ) . i inherited my husband older ipod shuffle after i gave him nano x-mas . i searched searched online but could not figure out whether ipod shuffle would work it . muchkin customer service verified it would because it came few adapters accomodate different mp3 players . now , i don't really think they made one specifically fit shuffle , but it fit well enough " small " adapter they included so i happy ( see picture i posted shuffle icrib ) . icrib itself 3 modes - light only ( ipod off ) , light ipod , or just ipod . you also it play 15 , 30 or 60 minutes before it shuts itself off . light actually what i would consider " light show " light slowly changing colors which i think rather calming my baby ( or least it seems ) . only things i would change icrib i would really like it option playing longer than 60 min . i would also happier if it option providing steady , soft light serve constant night light ( no " light show " ) guide me during middle night feedings . otherwise , i am thrilled icrib	1
i received different carrier both me my baby hated it . he couldn't see what going it seemed smother him it hurt my back . i decided purchase moby , i am so happy it . you wear it million different ways ( well , not million , but lot ) it so comfortable . it only took me twice get hang how put it . my son loves it too . my shoulders or back never hurt after carrying him it . i also love book it comes show you different ways which wear it . if you lose it , you go manufacture website , you download print there . i've bought two more my friends since i got mine	1

i purchased this stroller my newborn 2-year-old . i originally planned getting tandem ( fron t-t o-back ) stroller , but when i test-drove it store it felt like huge , long , heavy clumsy tank ( that without kids it ! ) there no way i'd able maneuver tandem stroller busy city streets . then i tried this aria twin side-by-side stroller , it felt so much better then tandem - it so light easy maneuver . so i purchased it , i really like it . it says stroller 6-month-old up , but i successfully use it newborn - seat reclines almost fully , newborn lays it sleeps . this stroller fits through all standard doors most supermarket isles . basket large fits lot stuff . walking city my 2-year-old newborn pretty easy this stroller . only major downside this stroller it doesn't hold car seat .	1
i purchased car adapter 10 hour drive my husband i making our toddler infant . i pump exclusively ( not able breastfeed ) so adapter godsend ! we didn't even pull over . just make sure you well covered don't end up stuck traffic next people who probably wondering what you're up ( unless you're into sort thing )	1
i never so excited new gadget . put it together ten minutes assitance my very excited toddler . i getting very impatient waiting this stroller come market , but couldn't more pleased i . i researched them all going buy it sight unseen , which made me nervous . went local retailer yesterday after instore test drive my almost 3yr old my 3 month old bought it immediately . i can't say enough great things this stroller . especially mom toddler infant . it handles like dream all bells whistles fabulous . folds like piece cake . which i can't say my perego . basket drops down so you access it without changing rear seat position . my 3yr old thinks it coolest thing ever she loves fact her baby sister right behind her . yes it little heavy , but i am small woman manage just fine . after all my oldest weighs 28lbs . it little longer person than photos - ( no big deal ) we all went our first family stroll after dinner last night it amazing . handles fantastically over bumpy sidewalks - no need prop up srtoller get over bump . so sturdy - feel like both my girls snug safe . love five point harness attached seat , unlike perego . really if you children ( particularly baby toddler ) this way go !!	1
i researching strollers months . i also considered combi , aria twin , maclaren . i test drove side side strollers but they couldn't fit through tight store aisles . i liked combi aria width but they awkward steer i didn't care storage any them . i agree above comments but pros outweight cons . it heavy it doesn't fold down compactly i would like but my son absolutely loves climbing front seat . i am 5'2 " i liked handles found it very easy steer . i love storage baskets my infant seat fits great . i am happy metropolitan fabric . it seems like i wipe clean . i fit most my grocerys basket underneath so i don't put both children " germy " shopping cart . cup holders nice too . very easy fold .. easier than my single graco stroller . 4 stars because it heavy bit awkward carry .	-1
my strictly bottle fed 11 month old used these bottles day one fine them . i saved money buying them thrift stores - half them i bought still boxes other half barely used . i ended up switching out older nipple design ( square top ) newer nipples because i liked design better . it seemed me newer design more correct suckling . i also bought lot new boxes liners thrift store too ! my daughter suffered mild gas , but nothing major . i liked these bottles because liner idea my best friend used them . i wish nipples would come more than two stages though because when my daughter hit 4 months , slow flow too slow fast flow too fast . i ended up putting straight pins slow flow boiling them pins open holes little more . it worked fine ! only time bottle ever leaked when i used drop-in liners that because it wasn't seated right rim bottle . many reviewers complained drop-ins don't hold full 8 ozs . they correct . solve this problem , i simply stuck standard liners i don't buy playtex brand . i buy parent choice ( pc ) brand walmart . thing careful measurements aren't always correct . i bought target brand 4 oz . liners realized ( after several bottles ) 4 oz . mark liner only 3 ozs . pc liners correct ! all-in-all , i like these bottles but am getting tired liners . i am currently reading reviews other bottles considering switching our next child . i'm really liking what i'm reading dr. brown , but possibly try couple other brands well . i'm realizing saving tons money isn't always what best my daughter . we'll see !	-1
i twin girls ( 8 months old ) once they learned sit up they no longer wanted lay back original tub i bought them . i tried fix it so they could sit up , but it complicated , they just not comfortable . i bought snug tub jr. so they could place sit enjoy bath time safely . even better ... i bought two snug tubs they both fit our standard tub . they sit up , face each other inflated sides make me feel comfortable they won't hit their heads . only bad thing i say it little hard close plastic stopper . but overall , we love it	1
we've using peg perego newest sip car seat since our son 6 weeks old . our son loves this car seat ... he never fusses it always happy go ride ! other posters mentioned seat angle very high upright . we personally didn't find this problem it helps our son reflux . poster mentioned straps uncomfortable , however pads shoulder straps included purchase . we found canopy quite sufficient . we older primo viaggio 2002 like features 2006 version ever better . yes , it expensive but imo safety seat worth it . plus , you don't re-thread straps everytime you need readjust shoulder height	1
these things great ! if you colicky baby ( most us some extent ) read " happiest baby block " get swaddleme baby wrap . yes you learn how swaddle blanket , but these so much easier , part because how many large square blankets you actually see out there ( required swaddling) ? only downside us velcro loop section wears out 2-3 weeks depending usage levels . not huge problem , since need swaddling usually ends around 3 months , they aren't expensive . it would also nice loop section larger , accommodate longer skinny babies . our son bit too long small , but waay skinny large	-1
i live studio apt . limited space this perfect me . i love storage bottom i keep all my sons blankets sheets there . it just right size fits snuggly corner . i however same problem mom . my son likes scoot himself diagionally ends up sleeping his face against wall . but his nose not press against it walls ventilated so i dont worry much . i cats canopy works perfect keeping them out sleeper . sheets very pricey 15$ each one my complaints . i like fact matress wipeable surface . it so much easier clean . i would recommend this product anyone ; well grandparets who looking something when thier grandkids come visit	-1
used 2 kids so far ... good : * it protects his feet/arms getting stuck slats . * when they pull up , they chew material instead wood . * easy remove wash . bad : * velcro straps bottom aren't long enough so they don't stay . * head foot pieces slide down when pulled . * first son pulled one those pieces down climbed up it . if this all you get , i'd get it , but it need some improvements .	-1
i like these clear . unfortunately my daughter stopped using pacifier , but when she use it , i liked able still see her beautiful face	1
i * love * this product . it far better velcro swaddler than other brands because it uses bigger patches velcro . comparison blanket , this much easier use provides much more durable swaddles . i'm quite good blanket , but six weeks age , my son could wriggle out . other hand , three months , he never wriggled out cotton flannel swaddleme . however , even cold weather , microfleece too hot . several times i've felt under blanket find my son sweaty . it even worse when we combine swaddle sling . other hand , cotton knit ( solid colors ) blankets too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit swaddleme into toga , leaving both arms flying free . cotton flannel ( gingham prints ) less stretch than other two fabrics , plenty enough cover keep baby warm indoor temperatures . it trickier find , but worth search . microfleece swaddleme , however , make great non-swaddle blanket cold days , particularly when baby front carrier . velcro quite versatile .	-1
i've used all sorts medela pumps , hospital grade lactina , symphony , pis advanced just good if not better . i didn't like symphony all b/c diaphragm goes machine really tight or it won't good suction ( which most time ) . i'm my third pis advanced . my first child , i pis advanced backpack , first generation , pumped year . amount milk adequate ( enough frozen away extra month after i stopped ) . i just didn't like faceplate ( i broke 3 , where you attach tubing faceplate ) , storage space backpack very limited . then i bought pis advanced shoulder bag my second child . storage area better but faceplate still same . then pis advanced limited edition came out . i saw it fell love it . so i get it . it nicest one thus far long overdue . motor sits separate bag tubing fit side pocket . there no danger breaking faceplate . i just carry work . i two sets parts , one home one work ) . bag lots storage space best all , it chic . they blue , chocolate black . it also doubles diaper bag me . hands free pumping : only reason i able pump year fist time now 11mo still going b/c hands free pumping kit . you get medela softcup bras ( they're comfy anyway ) supports handsfree pumping . there 2 tabs inside bottom one latch top . you don't need buy whole hands free pumping kit ; you just need loop hook attachment ( part #3007073 ) . hooks onto top bra where there latch . then you tie rubber band ( thicker kind any office supply store ) around tabs ( 3 them , two sewn bra one loop hook attachment ) . then you put breastshield connector bottles attached your breast . then you loop rubber band separately around connector ( part where you're suppose attach tubing ) . connect tubing , viola , it should stay there snugly . you don't hold them anymore . you also use this method softfit breastshield . if you larger breasts , use bigger rubberbands or link two together . now you massage get more milk , eat lunch , type computer , whatever ( just can't lie down ) . you buy adapter avent system pump directly into their bottles , or other brands . there no need pump every 3-4h after your milk supply established ... that insane . first few weeks it may necessary establish supply . i pumped 4 times day able get min 30oz day ( i bottle feeding breastmilk exclusively ) , then slowly decreased 3 , 2 1 my baby got older . key pump all milk out ( massaging squeezing your breast ) then let it run 1-2min longer . also , use maximum suction you tolerate ( this increase plateau you pump ) . if you want decrease supply , just pump shorter longer period time lapse pumping . if you want increase , pump longer more frequently well drink more water/eat more . i could increase decrease my supply , even without breastfeeding . i pumped directly into 9 oz or 11 oz avent bottles using avent adapter ( avail babiesrus ) . there other systems out there . i used lansinoh milk storage bags store my milk . i store 10-12oz ( max 12oz ) each bag , squeeze all air out , deep freeze it 6mo . i know lansinoh suggest less than , but it long you get all air out . trick use side table , push milk up ziplock squeeze close ziplock air pushed out . since there two zippers , little milk leak out first zipper help get all air out . bag expand freezer just fine . once it frozen , just don't nick bag ( b/c it easy damage it ) it stay fine 6mo deep freezer . even if you damage bag , it ok . it just pain when you thaw it . when you thaw milk , you might see little precipitate , but baby likes milk just like it fresh . happy pumping	-1
i am daily user pump style advanced breast pump very happy product . i've replace adapter ice pack which after contacting medela company , they replaced it free shipped items out me pronto ! make sure extra membranes hand they wear out after frequent use ; this affect efficiency pumping if you faulty membranes . their customer service line also helped me out troubleshooting which i greatly appreciated well . i've pumping 9 1/2 months now plan go full year help my medela breast pump .	1
we lived abroad my first born we used our sit stroll three or four international flights year !! kid comfy i traveling alone my son most time , i found it very managable sit stroll my backpack . moved back states baby number 2 -- used it often loaner stroller grandparents -- when they kids tow -- i still used it flights here -- all all wonderful investmen t-t ips : you need ask seatbelt extender airplanes -- no big deal they them -- you need raise armrest " click seatbelt " then lower it takeoff . good luck	1
triple play products joke company . they no customer support , example i needed get handle my sit stroll , it took 3 weeks me calling nonstop them get aggravated enough send me one . they also left voice mail saying i swearing harassing them . first i never swear when talking any kind customer service even if it voice mail every time you call three weeks straight . second if harassment they mean first ten days i called i nice last 11 days i called i told them their customer service nonexistent joke company no business ethics what so ever , then guilty charged . i also got touch strolex actual maker sit stroll tried get parts thru them they gave me triple play products phone number . when i explained my problem triple play strolex they didn't seem shocked , even said other people same problem them . product great you get one [ ... ] mesh bag sun cover shipping . great product i just hope you never replace parts , if you need get parts plan waiting 3 weeks response , called harassing customer because triple play products no clue what business ethics	1
several months research combined real-world experience pushing my nieces nephews different strollers brought us around bob revolution . we wanted stroller could handle rough/uneven sidewalks , cobblestone streets , off-road trails . we also wanted use same stroller mall , grocery store , small shops . we compact , lightweight stroller travel , so we focused three-wheelers air-filled tires , rotating front wheel ( must-have feature 3-wheelers ! ) , canopy excellent coverage . we looked strollers mountain buggy , valco , baby jogger , phil ted , dreamer designs , etc . ( we willing spend good amount quality stroller , but we not go bugaboo ) . we decided bob revolution we very happy it . pros1 . it very easy push over all kinds surfaces up hill well steer one hand . 2 . canopy far best we've seen any kind stroller . 3 . front wheel swivels 360 degrees lock . 4 . it folds/unfolds easily . 5 . seat roomy seems reasonably comfortable . 6 . shock absorbers more than few other strollers shocks . 7 . stroller this size/category , it not too wide , so we bring it into small shops navigate tight aisles turns easily . 8 . although not compact , least this stroller folds up decent size easy fit into car - most strollers this category much longer little wider than this when folded up . 9 . wheels easily removable . 10 . not too heavy - lighter than similar strollers this type . 11 . plenty accessories available . 12 . good , rugged build quality . 13 . wheels made sturdy plastic = nothing rust . cons1 . seat not recline very far , it requires you adjust two straps ( one either side top seat back ) . 2 . footrest not adjustable , i would preferred metal/plastic kick plate . 3 . when you fold stroller , it little awkward carry because front wheel sticks out you can't keep it folded up without rigging wrist strap - simple locking mechanism would better . 4 . storage basket could little bigger . 5 . handlebar not adjustable , however it high enough me ( over 6 ' tall ) . 6 . seat could use little more padding . our son seems more comfortable our little combi . 7 . no included accessories . keep mind this kind stroller typically stored garage not folded up all time . this excellent stroller worth money . fyi , here main reasons why we selected this stroller over similar ones : mountain buggy - canopy doesn't provide much sun protection , too big when folded , seat seams uncomfortable ( hammock style , limited padding = squishes child shoulders ); great build quality though easy fold up . valco - too difficult fold up , expensive ; fancy stroller good padding ; optional toddler jumper seat looks uncomfortable toddler if used more than briefly . phil ted - seems less sturdy , fabric footrest too close wheel so kids actually push impede front wheel ; optional second seat innovative design , but sacrifices storage area . alternative : we were'nt able actually see/test one , but boogie zooper looks interesting because it great feature set , adjustable footrest kickplate , full reclining seat back , comes great accessories . apparently , 2006 model redesigned lighter fix some issues older models	-1
one coolest features this stroller front wheel you either lock into position or unlatch so it rotates . turns dime so smooth push it actually makes using this fun . shocks great , baby isn't getting jolted around like his regular stroller . very pricey , but if you afford it , well worth cost	1

i use this pump all time- 95% my baby feedings . i actually 2 them . i keep one car clean bottle all times one house . pump easy clean , comes spare parts . this manual pump comfortable use . i know all experts recommend electric pumps , but i just fine using this manual pump saved ton money over electric pumps . avent bottles fit directly only this pump , so it quick simple take full bottle off pump either freeze it sealing disc , feed your baby putting nipple top , or store it fridge nipple top storage cap . i must note however 1 my pumps older version this model other newest version . newest current version leaks little where screw grooves pump meet bottle , older version different part not . so , just bit careful when using this otherwise you'll drops milk your clothes	1

it took us forever decide highchair we actually took our then 6 month-old shopping trips see which one he responded best . we found this one most versatile least likely catch his fingers tray . i also like it five-point harness . i see lot people problems their babies reaching tray . our son very tall , so this wasn't problem us . i also find it easy clean , straps come off machine washable i use damp cloth wipe it down . it folds up nicely go grandma house it nice so many levels adjustment so we feed couch if necessary . chair leans back those times he eats bottle or wants snooze his chair . it wheels easily dining room kitchen living room . i know it pricey , but it supports kids up 50 lbs , so i plan use it while it durable enough i'm sure someone else get plenty use out it after we're .	1
i love this diaper bag . first , it doesn't look like diaper bag . it pass purse looks very sporty . i don't feel like frumpy mom while carrying this . also , it carries quite bit without looking bulky . i regulary carry wipes , diapers my infant my potty-training toddler , plus least one change clothes each child two larger compartments . i still room my keys , wallet , cell phone , sun glasses , hair brush two inner zippered pockets . i only gave it 4 stars because shoulder strap needs little more padding . but , overall , it great diaper bag .	-1

this walker very easy put together . it doesn't need any tools assemble it , just open battery compartment ( small flat head screwdriver ) . instructions clear easy follow . walker itself looks cheap but actually i surprised how sturdy it once put together . i say washable seat this little tough snapping into place so i won't want remove it much wash it ... still small price pay safety . front wheels casters which rotate complete 360 . back wheels jsut go forward or backwards ... this safety feature , traction strips underside walker . baby only able move backwards first , but little time , s/he cruising all over . i am little concerned activity toys tray . reviews , it looks like baby may bang her mouth little . if case , it take me 2 minutes detatch toys save it later when she more control . also , sound toys actually not bad . most toys 2 volume settings ; loud louder ... this one ( my opinion)actually 2 real volue conrols ... soft medium . still if i ever get annoyed noise , i turn it off flipping switch ... or just let battery run ou t.t he worst part whole thing adjsuting it different height levels ... i found it easier turn walker upside down adjsut it way ... still , my thumbs bruised days all pressure it took adjust . hope this helps ... definately worth $40	-1

i went back forth before i finally decided add this my baby registry . i received it gift i'm so glad i registered it . true , velcro isn't too strong , which makes it slip if alot heavy items placed it . however , i used strategy reviewer used tied it crib some pretty ribbon it works wonderfully . i powder , lotion , baby oil , vaseline , some shoes , well package diapers few more items stored it it holding up fine . i think this organizer very useful convenient way keep much needed items close hand , especially if you lacking storage space . i would definitely recommend this item anyone i'm so glad i finally register it . only reason i not give it 5 stars because i make adjustment , using ribbons instead velcro it came . otherwise , i no other complaints	-1
we just purchased this item new grandbaby way . when my daughter-in-law received it she called me played all sounds me so i could hear them . soooo cute soothing -- i think i want one myself ! great soother	1
i bought these my twin boys after two weeks washing mountain " regular " bibs . i started using them when they 7 months used nothing else since . now they ten months self feeding , they saved me doing tons extra laundry . their clothes rarely any stains . i love i just rinse them after each meal either put them dishwasher or hand wash them end day . they make mealtime so much easier . one my boys loves rip off his bibs , but he can't budge this one !! they also love fish out any dropped food trough try again get it into their little mouths . everywhere i take boys i get such positive feedback them .	1
this thing great . catches most drips spills our 2 year old . other bibs keep stuff off clothes , this keeps lot it off floor too . they've redesigned latching mechanism keep it catching kid hair make it easier open	1
we purchased this monitor use our 2 year old daughter room . we intrigued this product since we able communicate her without going her room ( she likes try get us come her room when she doesn't want go sleep ) . our only reason buy this monitor . now , it our favorite ( out 3 different brands ) . there no background noise/static like we her old monitor . it also rechargeable battery , so both receivers charged ready go whenever wherever you want use it . it very easy use quite clear . i plan buying one our son when he gets little older .	1
it not clearest or easiest use , but it work . you tell difference baby other sounds . it pretty sensitive we've happy it . i don't think you go wrong money . if i grading it value money , i'd give it higher rating . but i'm rating it based what it over others i've seen or heard	-1
my 3 4 year olds absolutely love their new " big boy " seats their own cup holders . seat gives really nice support system using car seat belts . head , neck shoulders all supported nicely . i would absolutely recommend this item someone who ready upgrade baby seats	1
there many good things this product : it easy clean ( wipe it cloth clean ) , it small , it reclines , it 5-point harness , tray dish washer safe , it sturdy , it grows your child . after using more expensive product ( twice price ) very difficult clean i am thrilled find this highchair . i only wished i discovered it 2 1/2 years ago my son .	1
our son almost 16 months old we using these sippy cups 10 months now . we never them leak , mold , spouts push through or anything ! i suggest reading directions before tossing these sippy cups trash . i cannot get over how many parents assume avent line alot " hype " just because they failed read directions . complaints mold sour milk ... that just gross . wash sippy cup after it used . i'm sure any other brand would get moldy smelly if you left it your trunk all summer ... not avent fault ! anyway , green spouts stiffer than white ones more difficult clean ... ok , maybe first few times because they new ; but they get more pliable . i spoke avent rep baby fair edison , nj she suggested buying new spouts every month or so ( same nipples avent bottles ) . they wear out ... especially if you're using same two or three sippy cups every day . i just bought ( tried ) " sport spout " although it quite mouthful liquid comes out , our son no problem spout , either . no leaks so far . all all , read directions you see leaks disappear like magic ! good luck	1
service target very good . item arrived good condition quite fast . walker although not colorful it seems picture but good enuff keep my son engaged . it safe same time glides both carpet vinyl floor .	-1
my granddaughter , age 7 mos ., enjoying her new-found freedom i think this product well worth money . folding , take , feature great they live quite distance me this makes walker easier pack .	1
i started out pumping thought i would store all my milk medela bottles . when i realized how much milk i would need store , i quickly realized would cost me arm leg ( bottles run 20 bucks 4 ! ) came upon these little wonders . they made thick polyethylene plastic ( safe long-term storage ) you can't beat zip-loc style closure compared other tie bags ... those scared me , every drop truly precious . granted , they bit awkward first because you dealing container much less sturdy than plastic bottles most women pump into but it works well once you get used it .	1
my newborn hated tummy time floor . would lay his head down just cry , just like my daughter . i bought lamaze spin explore , he loved it . within days , he could hold his head all way up minutes time , now he four months old , he spins himself around playing different toys attached . great buy	1
my son smaller version ( 11 " ) fluffles ( aka lambchop ) since birth . he now 9 months old " lambchop " go everywhere he goes . needless say lambchop gets very used . label says surface clean only , but my mother keeps our son she decided one day try wash lambchop . he really needed good washing because our son going through heavy drooling stage lambchop fur getting crunchy . well , he made it through gentle cycle through dryer ( rack air fluff cycle ) . he washed this way several times . he comes out so nice fluffy . course , wash your own risk , but it works us . i am going purchase our son larger version ( 14 " ) fluffles . this so handy event we retire original fluffles ( lambchop ) , fluffles able grow our son , also . we love this toy	1
our son , now 3 mo old , great sleeper when he swaddled this thing . without it he thrashes his arms legs startles himself awake . it he settles down sleeps like champ . we've using it since he newborn . little square velcro doesn't hold bottom part well all , but it winter so we dress him sleeper jammies underneath swaddleme anyway so it not big issue . when we came home hospital first we tried swaddling using receiving blankets but our son wiggled right out . we're huge fans swaddleme now give it our standard baby shower gift .	-1

three children our household , we've seen our share good back educational toys . this one one best , particularly households want promote musical affinity . it provides endless combinations choices depending where child places cube . it also gives three different " styles " music : jazzy , classical funk . only reservation i it may little difficult babies less than 1 year old .	1
overall we quite happy bundleme , which fits perfectly into our infant car seat ( graco snugride ) . product good quality , though zippers not running very smoothly . regarding its design , only downside we see front part very loose , making it difficult get tight enough fit around baby neck shoulders keep him warm colder weather . bottom line , however , it good product we recommend .	-1
this great purchase . bag fit my britax boulevard carseat gogobabyz wheels attached it . i able wheel my baby car seat airport up gate then easily place carseat wheels into bag gate check it . it kept car seat clean i able store extra blanket inside bag .	1
we used this carrier while trip florida . it very convenient use wheel through airport since we dont check carseat so we use it plane . since bag 2 zippers it , we actually able leave my sleeping daughter car seat bag zippers part way down each side so her face out . this way i didnt carry sleeping baby other bags through aiirport- i just pulled her car seat since it wheels . she fell asleep her carseat while plane didnt wake up until after we got off plane , picked up our baggage , got our rental car , put her car seat car traveling our destination . we also used eddie bauer bag past trip - strap broke while carrying it through airport it doesnt wheels so it much more difficult carry .	1
i received this baby welcoming gift back oct 2003 . i used it every single time we need shopping cart love it ! i leave it back my car grab it when we go store . almost everytime we're out , i get someone asking me where i got it . i wash mine probably once or twice month it still looks fabulous ! my second child using it loves eat small snack off it while we shop . i am buying one my friend who due next month buy all my future expecting friends ! perfect gift dearly loved	1

this one best devices we ever got help toilet training . boys really took it right away now prefer it over sit down . flushing mechanism not well made broke pretty quickly . but we still use it lot	-1
i just purchased this cool , wet spring months new england . i also bundle me original which great winter months . this nice alternative when original becomes too warm use , but you still need little something . inner lining soft against your baby skin outside lining protects him/her against cool weather rain . only negative thing i say this it not fit well my car seat original . it tends slide down little . i new graco safe seat which larger than most car seats so this could reason . it may fit better smaller car seats . i also love pink " girly " color . now weather warming up bit , it works great when going into air conditioned buildings just little too cool baby . it also nice barrier sun harmful rays	-1
this lamp perfect my baby nursery . it matches all other hello kitty stuff	1
after reading other reviews this product i felt i needed put positive spin this product . i registered this item received it my shower . my son 5 1/2 months old severly congested . i took box out his closet set up machine . after first night ( 10 hours ) he woke up first time 2 weeks able drink his bottle out me using saline drops aspirator . i am continuing use this product every night every morning much more pleasant . noise level i not find issue . i don't problem hearing my son cry or even move around monitor . i feel noise actually soothing child helps fade out other noise house . i am glad i got this product would personally recommended it anyone . i understand this product little pricey but i believe it worth every penny !!!!!	1
finally bottle easy clean my baby loves ! we through every bottle out there wasted so much money i vowed never try -- but when my second baby refused bottle ( i settled playtex my son because it problem-free ) refused playtex , i tried these . it only bottle she take . she also breastfed , so i'm not sure if these just better breastfed babies , but she no gas problems these , they incredibly easy . also cool how cover fits bottom bottle so if you out it easy find .	1
our son would never take paci if it weren't soothies !!! there no giving it up now ! -- now we same nipple our bottle . no more nipple confusion ! :op they great , no complaints . i don't know why previous reviewer only gave 4 stars . if you don't screw any bottle tight enough it leaks ... duh !	1
this 4th stroller i've purchased . i lightweight combi great travel it folds tiny only $40 . but it not going hack it everyday use . larger travel system stoller i so cumbersome stores difficult load into trunk . this aria very easy , looks great , lightweight found balance small sturdy . i love it . i recommend it other moms when i get chance . peg great reputation lasting , so i hope this " entry level " price point meets expectation . so far i feel like it great value far strollers go	-1
twins we always write down everything , or we wouldn't remember whom we feed , when we feed them , or any details . we used keep chart , but then i received itzbeen gift . it so much faster press button then write everything down . when we go out i just toss it my purse when babies start crying i just pull out itzbeen look timers figure out if it time eat or they just fussy . if boys eat or require diaper change , i record it easily . no more carrying around clipboard ! i didn't give it 5 stars because it would even better if it could track how many oz formula babies eat if it could total number hours baby slept . but still it nice tool forgetful people . i'm buying 2nd one , so i one each my twins	-1
i bought this upon recommendation my lactation consultant , so far i've very pleased . i wanted few bottles breastmilk available so my husband could feed our baby when i'm out running errands . there just few parts , so assembly , disassembly , cleaning very easy . but best part pump , you buy different-sized breastshields use it . i needed larger one than what came standard it . it makes pumping more comfortable . first few times i used it , i considered switching electric pump because i wasn't pumping much milk . but more i pumped , more milk i produced . this breastpump worth every penny . i recommend it anyone who primarly breastfeeds , but wants option able someone else occasionally feed baby .	1
my son 7 weeks old using snuggle nest my bed since he 3 weeks old . he loves his snuggle nest began sleeping 3-4 hours time very 1st night it . we now use it combination swaddle me wrap techniques i learned free happiest baby block dvd came our snuggle nest . thanks this wonderful combo our 7 week old baby sleeps through night ( 7-8 hrs ) . this my 3rd baby 1st i used snuugle nest or swaddling he 1st sleep so well so early . if i could give this product 10 stars i would . i also plan use snuggle nest when/if we transition our baby his crib month or two , i am sure it make transition easier him	1
i recomend this item parents who want peace mind while their baby asleep . it protects child rolling onto his/her side allows parents sleep their baby without fear smuthering baby . however it best if you king size bed . my huband i sleep either edge bed while baby asleep us , feeling little cramped	1
my son great time his bath turtles . he learned colors play features each turtle , so that educational plus i not expect all ! somehow , turtles end up floating upside down during bath time -- splash factor , maybe ? but that half fun -- making him turn them over again more play . they easy clean dry so that plus . one bath turtle i don't completely understand one mirror inside . because temperature water , it causes condensation protective plastic bubble , so he can't see mirror anyway , so what point one ? nevertheless , he kinda looks it middle his bath probably thinks , " hey , i there minute ago ... " he picks one up , holds it up his eye level , struggles find himself second , laughs , puts it back water picks up turtle . go figure . it still good fun him , turtles keep him occupied during shampooing what not , therefore , they're okay me ! totally safe drain proof	1
i hate think all germs shopping carts . i always used this seat cover never let my son touch shopping carts or restaurant high chairs . too bad 26 months he now too big it now sits those germ infested car shopping carts . oh well . purchase this product you won't disappointed . i washed it often it lived trunk my car . i say i not put it carry bag form because it took too long get it way , but it didn't matter anyway it quicker put it grocery cart when it not bag form . great baby shower gift	1
i nursed my now 4-year-old daughter almost year pumped daily . i hated always boil pump 20 minutes , which also tough pump plastic parts , which would yellow until i replaced them . now i am nursing my 3-month-old son . i thrilled find these micro-steam bags ! i use them not only sterilize pump after each use , but also bottles . ( though i pump daily , i only occasionally use bottles , so always boiled them , too - this sooooooo much easier ! ) i am so glad they came out this product - it just makes things lot easier ! it so inexpensive , too !	1
not much it , just swatch cloth really . but it what it says it	-1
i using avent on-the-go pump set over 4 1/2 months now , i think pump very easy use . i find it very comfortable , am easily able pump 4 or more ounces under 10 minutes . i used medela electric pump ( i not know which model ) once found avent isis manual pump allowed me pump more milk less time . * only * thing i would suggest new mothers ( their significant others ) practice assembling pump few times prior arrival their little one . i found first week my baby life i too overwhelmed sit down read avent instructions how put pump together correctly .	1
these very convenient if your child already using avent bottles . if you use medela pump , you get adapter pump straight into these containers , eliminating step breastmilk collection chain . i also find small sizes convenient , especially if you normally pump four ounces or less out one or both breasts . i didn't give this product five stars , though , because , really , these just four more avent bottles sealing disc . if you bunch bottles anyway , you just buy pack sealing discs $4 use those instead .	-1
we used avent our 1st baby loved it . now we expecting munchkin , we planning using them again . i loved these . i loved how simple it made it store my milk . straight isis pump my fridge/freezer . simple . yes , defrosting takes longer than some alternatives , but i always bottle fridge while one defrosting . i found warming it boiling pot water work best quick defrost . they take up more room than bags when storing , but i think convience outweighed problem . i stored milk fridge freezer learned rotate so room wasn't terrible problem . ( if you this , it important label date containers ) this also saved me defrosting last minute . i some leaking issues time time , but figured it out . if you tighten container/bottle too much it leak . simple fix ... don't over-tighten . ( avent site short trouble shooting list leakage problems ) we tried other products , but avent best our family .	1
i use these storage containers mixing breast milk rice cereal feed my daughter while we out . i love these containers this use . i don't any problem leaking i feed my daughter straight out jar . i gave these 4 stars because i didn't get any use out these storing breastmilk freezer ( which why i registered them first place ) . it takes forever defrost breastmilk these bottles . i just ended up using lansinoh gerber milk storage bags because they defrosted quickly took up much less room freezer	-1
my baby also cereal thickened formula his really bad reflux ( ordered his doctor i might add ) . these nipples work great long formula too thick use regular stage 1 or 2 nipple . only problem i found these nipples you gentle when you using nipple brush clean them so you don't tear y-cut opening ..... 2 our nipples tore cuts causing hole become larger . but gentler cleaning checking nipples before each use remedied this problem . also want add my son started using these nipples age 2 months no problems sucking them .	1
i combi until few days ago , i loved it but basket just too small , it net kind . i also wanted snack tray my one-yr old son . also i felt my son already growing out it . i alot research , wanted light , easy-to-handle stroller bit bigger than my combi . i purchased aria few days ago , after alot steering store , my son it . i found no problem steering , matter fact it so easy steer , even one hand . my son more elbow room his new stroller , snack tray great . i don't use 5pt harness much , but times i i no problem it . basket great , lots room . far cup holder parent , it isn't big any means , but i never carry around 32 oz big gulp , so it isn't problem me . i usually small bottle water or small starbucks cup . unless you travel large cups or bottles , it works just fine . i am very happy this stroller , weight it carrying handle both wonderful	1

i've this bag well over year now . i toddler preschooler it works just fine carry their stuff mine everyday outings . it also held up well . i've washed it few times it comes out looking very good . i really like separate compartments which make it much easier find one little thing . i like pockets front strap cell phone nuk . so nice those right hand . i also like fact it goes across body ... no more hitting my daughter diaper bag when i lean down pick her up . bottle holder thing very small , so i don't really use it .	1
people may say leash my kid inhumane , but i'd rather than they get run over car or lost mall . my kids love wearing these things , they look cute . leash part tail little annoying if my toddler lagging , she gets mad cause i'm pulling tail up over her shoulder .	-1
very happy product extremely pleased customer service travelwithkids	1
most diaper hangers one compartment big stack disposables . we use variety cloth diapers this organizer great because it space hold our prefolds , fitteds , doublers , pockets inserts , covers . i haven't loaded heavy things onto it , but i've never problem shelves unstable reviewer	1
top clip not difficult me use but my daughter hasn't figured it out yet - which way i want it . i've also used it booster i satisfied way buckle looped through stayed place . i also like strap bottom allows me add little slack or tighten it little . i think that really important feature - especially this season when my kid may wearing jacket one day none next also if you use car seat different kids similar but not exactly same size . i car seat without i find sometimes i can't get it closed because it too tight sometimes there too much slack	1
over-all these pretty good bottles . only thing i feel could use some improvement shape top bottle , it little bit too wide . example : when you get end feeding tilt bottle upward get last 1/2 ounce or so , base nipple actually touching babies nose . other than , these great bottles . they resonably priced , never any problems w/ leaking absolutely love cap snaps onto bottom bottle , genius !	-1
this crib makes our nursery ! every person seen room comments what beautiful crib this . wood very thick expensive looking very inexpensive price . crib very sturdy when put together , no movable parts ( front piece doesn't lower ) it very safe baby . knowing this crib grow my baby through toddler childhood years reassuring too . i'm glad i purchased this crib ! you can't beat quality price	1
cherry wood itself very great , however , painting easy scratched during delivery installation . both packaging delivery should more careful . deliverer put it my condo guard while i home , why not sent huge heavy item directly my door ?	-1
this wipes best . it smells good , non-alcoholicand perfect even most sensitive skin . tryit ! you won't regret	1
this activity mat expensive ( i bought it full price almost $60 ) but there lot usage it . i started using it my baby when she 2 months old , she enjoyed seeing colorful toys above her . she grew , she loved her tummy colorful mat , especially crinkling leaf . attached toys excellent themselves i used them clip onto her carseat crib . only when she could finally get up crawl she tire mat . my only criticism " musical " toy dangles . it switch on/off which great . however , volume music loud ! many dark night i tried tiptoe past it heart attack when i accidentally tapped toy music blasted . also , sun-mirror comes off easily hard prop up . again , this well worth it well designed toy any infant .	-1

when my daughter born , i didn't know swaddling , it would take me hours get her sleep ! i would feed or rock her my arms until she falls asleep , then put her her crib ... she'd flail her arms , wake up cry , i start all over ! what nightmare ! then i figured out since her arms wake her , it would make sense wrap her something so she couldn't move them much ... so i started wrapping her regular receiving blankets . it worked ! it became much easier get her sleep . but then she wiggled out those receiving blankets wake up again . when she little over month old , somehow i came across swaddleme blankets internet immediately bought it . it worked great ! it so easy wrap my daughter it , it stayed put . my daughter started sleeping so much better ! i wish i found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me so many sleepless nights ! 2 years later , my son born , thankfully i already knew those blankets start . he goes sleep great swaddleme blanket ! out curiosity , i tried put him sleep without this blanket , his arms wake him right away - exactly same my daughter ! i consider this blanket one most important baby items you could buy . it should must new mother who wants get some sleep	1
this wonderful ! my 3 month old sleeping 8-9 hours night last month or so thanks this ! we smaller one when she newborn thank goodness they make it larger . she always seemed big swaddle blankets , she would work herself free but this very soothing her . i would recommend it any new parent	1
my daughter loves these bottles , they same her pacifier they work very well . i seen few complaints vents leaking , but really happens all bottles vents these arent nearly bad avent bottles . i am glad i bought these	1
someone wrote this good cloth diapers . only if you put them dry . if you put water ( additive your choice ) put your diapers , this dangerous : babies ( ie ones old enough get pull themselves up ) drowned diaper pails . esp if they step front lid pops open they try reach inside . headfirst . only use diaper pail latches solidly closed if you going put cloth diapers you soak . dry diapers cloth or disposable variety this great buy	-1
this valance great ! i 2 smaller windows my baby girl room able cut valance , sew edges make it fit both windows ! it hangs straight down so you able see all animals i didn't even cut animal half . i gotten so many compliments this pattern - it just best either boy or girl room .	1
i actually received this valance zanzibar bed set . but , if you need purchase one extra window nursery - not hesitate . this beautiful valance actually same lovely fabrics ( including suede like fabric ) textured animals bed skirt , bumper , quilt . i noticed other bed sets ( even expensive ones ) where valances quite plain . valance measure around 90 inches wide . but , meant bunched up look so it looks great narrower windows . also , beige or sage colored drapes or sheers would great complement this valance shield nursery day light during nap time	1
hy wife hard time sleeping while pregnant . one night i watched her toss turn i decided soemthing her . i went target bought her boppy body pillow . night she slpet sound first time over month . she drags thing room room house , she lays it watch tv sleep . it take up some room bed , but it well worth me little less room her sleep sound . also few times i stolen it used it while i lay ground watch football . it very comfy . i never pregnant woman , but what my wife tells me this must	1
target - this re-do review i just sent . please use this one instead i not explain it right first time : love sleek new non-potty design , it gives more sense privacy . no wonder kids not want sit old-fashioned chair ones . different size measurements info informative but need know liquid measurement how much it would safely hold .	1
this great buy ! easy assemble looks gorgeous . one most important things - it very solid .	1
keeps your baby getting foot stuck through side crib , but still fits tightly safely	-1
what godsend this . our daughter 3 years old we take this thing everywhere ! sure , we keep potty-toppers us , but sometimes just isn't enough . this go potty far better than any porta-potty or gross outdoor park restroom . we used this potty park , while making rounds build/construction sites , baseball games , even parking garage our hockey rink ! our daughter use it just anywhere . it small size allows her use it discreetly comfortably . if you ever venture more than 30 seconds clean toilet , you need this . then you'll wonder how you ever got without it	1
we love this crib - we looked several bassinettes pack-n-plays because we wanted our baby our room us first few months before transitioning her her big crib her room , but we also wanted something versatile could used her play ( we hard wood floors i wanted something i could push around house room room so she could me ) . this crib so much more attractive than pack-n-plays but functional lasts so much longer than other cradles or bassinettes . one biggest advantages it fits through doorways , which pack-n-play not , i wanted something i could roll around room room . this useful when she newborn we wanted keep her room us , or just push her next room where we could hear her . i also plan use it roll around house when she older using it play . nice thing it it works just like regular crib side lowers mattress level which two settings . other reviewer right , you push it up your bed if you want co-sleeper type bed , you could even lower side down easy reach baby . i not used it this way but it would perfect thing if my baby got sick . tho other thing i love this crib sleeper or play area , it lasts much longer than bassinnett or cradle - long pack play- i believe up 50 pounds . finally , it really nice looking , since we it our master bedroom , i wanted something would cute not bulky or would stand out too much . this one really attractive . negatives : mattress pretty wimpy , which why i gave this 4 stars . but she , just 6 months , still sleeping it night seems very comfortable it . next baby , i probably look around mattress . other negative crib not travel too well - unlike pack-n-play . it fold up easy storage , but unless you minivan or suv , it still pretty large store trunk - it not fit into our volvo 4-door car trunk . i would also recommend buying one port-a-crib bumper pad sets ( around 40- 50.00 ) babies us because they fit this crib best . i bought 15.00 koala kids bumper pad it too big buckles around bed , so i only recently started using bumper pad fear she would press up against it night . but you need bumper pad crib they get older because they start sticking their legs arms out slats while asleep . nice crib - good choice .	-1

this our second highchair . we owned evenflow discovery highchair found it many problems , so we forced buy better produc t.t his chair worth price . our daughter very tall , but 23 months she still uses this highchair no problems . pros : vinyl seat-makes easy cleanup safety harness superior extra tray very convienent folds up nicely locking wheels seat moves up downcons : release tabs tray easy break . if you don't properly push them or out they snap right off your tray no longer lock place .	1
we bought this high chair our daughter we love it . it easy use set up . i would given five stars but unfold/fold it you need two hands which sometimes isn't too " handy " when you crying baby one them . seat adjusts up down so your child sit right table you . stated above , legs fold together so you store chair when not using . chair cover also easy take off when it needs cleaned(which we tub ) attached snaps . my little one ten months old , 19 pounds , 27.5 inches not even close outgrowing this chair . i definitely recommend this chair . hope this helps !	-1
i one these cribs already my son . we one way when it came choice which crib buy there no question . this crib so versatile . it goes crib toddler bed then full size . we use it years . i'm only 5'4 " tall i little worried side not moving down but it works out great me even when it lowest level . i would recommend this crib anyone	1

my 4.5 month old son loves his jump go . it christmas present santa , my husband i happy it well . i've seen some reviews calling it " dangerous " but i think only danger comes when parents aren't watching their children . we never leave him unattended his jumper we've no problems . first week or so he just kind hung around it , moving around circles . he finally gotten hang jumping he also realizes he one controlling all sounds . only drawbacks i see it , reason i only give 4 out 5 stars , volume setting goes loud extremely loud . i wish there one more quieter setting . also , any doorway jumper , there bit more potential injury than stationary jumpers . but i said before , if you monitor your child , said child should fine . i highly recommend this product	-1
this carseat best ! not only it easiest installation ever ( we actually went back re-read instructions because we couldn't believe it could so easy ) , but it also very safe seat . they special bicycle padding add more protection baby . safety features outstanding . child restraint so easy use non-twisting straps , easy lock system pull belt tighten harness without struggle . , it looks great too ! we explorer print love it . all our chicco products fabulous ( polly high chair playard too )	1
i received crib box shreds . amazingly , all pieces intact because hardware sealed , smaller box . delivery people must stuck some other hardware loose shipping into box , because i got some weren't even part crib ! they must thought pieces fallen out it because it tatters . there few marks metal crib , but if it wood i'm sure it would worse . very disappointed shape box , but crib acceptable	-1

i love this crib set ! i snoopy set porta crib ( i think it recently discontinued ) before i put this one . it cute but bumper didn't fit too well ( kinda awkward uneven ) quality fabrics used fitted sheet bumper felt cheap . i got malawi porta crib set present ( i added it into my registry because i liked colors i thought it looked cute ) . i exchange it store credit because i thought i no use it but i'm glad i didn't . bumper fits almost perfectly feels thicker safer use . i love feel fabrics used whole set . it definitely worth money	1

i've using these store milk 6 months now , i love them . ( i use 8 oz size ) they stack together so they don't take up too much room my bag morning . ( i work 12 hour shifts 3 days week-so need take several every day ) they sit upright so they don't leak my cooler or refrigerator work ( avoids gross-out factor co-workers bags ) i recently bought adaptors pump directly into them , love them even more . also , my husband handle milk when i am work , these way easier him than bags , so he wastes less milk spilling , etc . my only comment you careful not overfill them , breast milk expands when it freezes , pop off lid or crack container . but this would concern any storage container , bags included . hate way breast milk storage bags leak when they thawing out , no matter how flat you try freeze them , they never stack up well , so you end up avalanche bags falling out freezer . i love these containers sturdy plastic stack up freezer , they don't require special handling thaw avoid contaiminating milk . buying bases lids separately , containers not meant used more than three times before they discarded , while lids hold up much longer , so i'm glad i only buy what i need time , so no wasted money or extra supplies store . cost , other similar containers cost $3-4 each , so $15 10 lids bases seems very reasonable	1
i bought this product put our pack play living room it works perfectly . i our wipes container top , diapers under , one side i diaper rash cream , comb some other things other side we our remote controls our phone . it works great	1
i am so impressed how diaper depot . this functional easy way store all my baby changing table items . it enough room all things i need it sturdy . i really concerned cloth storage units because i worried they would too flimsy . no worries this one . i am very happy .	1
i bought my 7month old daughter nicest model infant safe seat(it central park pattern)about month ago . before i dared buy any kind car seat my daughter again i made sure i read over every parent review i could find(so i thank those who reviewed this before me , they big help ) . i found few complaints i this carseat myself after testing it out stores . i'll post few possible solutions i've found . complaint #1 : it too big fit top shopping carts . i don't like it , but apparrently you're not even supposed put carseat/carriers shopping carts . it throws off balance cart cause cart tip over super easy what i've heard . i think graco actually makes them so they don't fit reason . complaint #2 : metallic or nylon-like fabric uncomfortable baby my daughter hated metallic nylon fabric when i tried her into them store so we bought pattern didn't it(central park ) . you check gracobaby.com see other patterns don't it . thats where we found ours . complaint #3 : waist belts angle leaving marks babys ' thighs . my daughter got marks first time she wore sunsuit it but now i just pull dress part down her skin belts . angle though so waist belts sit pelvis(or close possible newborn ) , which safest ideal place them sit baby . complant #4 : its ' too big fit most cars i thought sure it wouldn't fit our car especially because our snug ride barely squeezed backseat . but oddly enough this thing fits better into our old beat up 1992 chevy lumina(the sedan not minivan)than snug ride . if you've ever seen those old cars you'd know when front seat(s ) pushed all way back there pretty much no room any kind rear facing carseat . infant safe seat installed properly my husband still put front seats all way back . this thing still fits into cars better than any convertible carseat . before deciding infant safe seat i tried graco , evenflo , britax , eddie bauer convertible seats into car . complaint #5 : it heavy bulky . it bulky , but how else could it accomadate higher weight height limit . heavy graco says it only weighs 5 pounds more than old(20lb , 26 " )snug ride . babies ' ' us i tried holding our old snug ride(26 " , 20lbs ) infant safe seat both hands compare weight even switched hands , but couldn't tell difference . i also tried my daughter it carried her around store . i think because size it makes it easier carry bigger/heavier babies , because my 18lb 27 " daughter lot more difficult carry her now out-grown snug ride . i like even once i no longer carry her around it i'll still convenience travel system beyond first year if my daughter sleeping . that something no other carrier ( or convertible carseat ) offer . complaint #6 : it doesn't fit over-turned wooden highchairs i made it point try carrier restauraunt high chairs when i got it . i tried it 4 different restauraunts not any more trouble than i snug ride . so far what i've seen they've fit perfectly . complaint #7 : stroller matches carseat quite large most patterns only offer quattro tour stroller match it , however 3 nicest patterns/models , samba , collection , central park also offer matching metrolite stroller , fusion patter also offers matching mosaic stroller , however pierson pattern only offers matching mosaic stroller . quattro tour stroller full size stroller so it heavier , bulkier , more nifty features , than metrolite mosaic stollers . so keep mind when choosing stroller . complaint #8 : it too big newborns . 3 nicest patterns/models infant safe seats come infant headbody support , though it isn't greatest if it doesn't work your baby then you just buy kiddopottomus snuzzler infant headbody support . it actually reversible made out super soft velboa material one side other soft woven fabric . i buy one my daughter when she born because she only 6lbs 12.5 oz . she so small even her snug ride looked like it swallowed her up when i buckled her into it . i've actually seen other reviews recommending snuzzler newborns who're going infant safe seat . complaint #9 : head support carrier comes doesn't work you even buy separate ( double)head supports snug rides ( even ones come single one ) unless you buy one nicest snug ride models comes double head supports . head support comes most infant safe seats made more older napping babies . i recommend especially baby double head supports if you don't get snuzzler because they're made 100% jersey knit cotton , back head supports slightly padded , they're deeper than any other head supports i've seen , so they hold babys ' head better , you get them quite few different colors match your car seat	1
this our second boulevard model carseat we love both them . my only complaint it hard get it centered/level back seat when it rear facing ( i 04 camry my husband 06 corolla ) . tether wants pull it one side or other . we also pull out back support pillow order get latches click without cutting off circulation our daughter legs . but cover very luxurious - more so than you see picture . i holding out shannon cover but britax kept pushing release date back , i needed get seat quickly my daughter outgrowing her infant seat . i very , very happy when i saw how pretty cover . other than asthetics seat , it seems very solid safe , i am very comfortable knowing it keeping my daughter safe secure when we driving	-1

tubing works perfect you would expect medela . however , i received it seller zip-lock bag , literally . no factory seal , no mention medela name anywhere . this came flyer advising me if i open use product , ( it single-user only ) , it not refundable . however , there no way me sure noone used it . , it basically came already open	1
i first bought safefit mirror , not pleased it . i bought this mirror because remote . i ford freestyle headrest middle , so it fit perfectly not block my view . i bought mirror , so she would something other than carseat look while i'm driving , not so i could look her , even though i see her my rearview mirror . i used it passenger seat see her , relocate pacifier . what i like it once you turn it , it stays . i don't turn it every five minutes like some toys . it also adjustable noise levels , lights and/or music , but you obviously can't front seat , so i leave it same setting . i no problem turning it remote , i it clipped my sun visor , it works there ( but angle right my car , i guess ) . only complaint i would lights hard see daytime , but she seems entertained what she sees mirror music , night watches lights . it little more expensive , but worth money my opinion .	1

i don't know what i would without this chair . it so great ... especially when your baby young . my little one didn't like all " fancy " chairs lights such right away . she would cry or fidget them ... i think because they overstimulating . but i could always put her this chair ! it soft looks comfortable ( she always seems peaceful sitting it ) . it lay flat or inclined slightly so baby see things . i also like little head rest keep her head flopping all over place ... lot other chairs aren't " new baby " friendly . it also offers vibration music , which nice . now she bit older , she likes animals bar talks them . she still loves sleep it it nice comfy place her sit ( especially when i need bit break ) . i would recommend this any new mom ... it great chair your newborn !	1

( he thought it funniest thing world , he okay , thank god . ) but little plastic hook piece his hand . if you 6-month old child you know they eat everything they find . i thank god he didnt put his mouth . it great soother baby , but sure there no defects every day ! like i said before , other than this , it great .	-1
this product not safe product should not used your child . not only it give additional padding not intended , nor tested your safety seat , but it also voids warranty safety seat . nhtsa ( national highway traffic safety administration ) government agency sets standards child safety seats states " after-market products " should not used . it also not meet fmvss213 standards stated manufacturer description	-1
i love this swing because it goes side side , she sit when awake , lay down when asleep , once you put her she out cold . after 6 weeks using it i thought battery going , but when i changed battery music still slow i still keep swinging motion high , two weeks later it just stopped working . i've only it two months hardly use it , just total 3 hours day give or take few	-1
i'm not certain why there so many glowing reviews this product . my wife registered this item because 4 stage tub looked good theory . unfortunately , because collapsible design this " bath " tub not hold water , it just runs out seam where two sides come together . there foam gasket around seam intended hold water , but it useless . sling useful bathing infant , removable ring it job keeping infant upright while learning sit . unfortunately , time our infant ready sit we already replaced this piece junk . i guess they call it safety 1st your kid can't drown dry bath tub	-1
we ordered one , it didn't work well . it seemed great , but it bear fold when there little bit wind . based all reviews , we thought we must defective one . we ordered replacement , but it seems same issues . very disappointed .	-1
this seat great concept , it just doesn't stay together very well . i took it back store they marked it " defective " . few dollars more , i got " healthy care booster seat " fisher price . i've much better luck it	1
this product just doesn't much variety . my baby both completely bored it , only used it handful times . they 5 months 1 year . she like noise makers squishy toys , but these all hard , boring toys ... least my kids	-1
our daughter kept sliding out it wedges wouldn't stay place . i love idea , but it just didn't work us	1
we received this mattress babyshower gift 4 years ago ( i registered babies us ) . my first child used it little over 2 years . my second child used it nearly 2 years . neither child big ( fact , one rather petite ) . even though mattress not abused , it cracked ripped numerous places . i'm currently researching ' lifetime warranty ' policies kolkraft . i don't recommend this mattress .	-1
after concerted effort get this monitor work acceptably , i returned it . this one few products i've truly made me ask , " what they thinking ? " monitor gives off loud " out range " beep whenever it not good communication , there no way shut it off . compound fact it intermittently think it out range even when it just next room , it completely unusable when parents trying sleep . but that least it . voice-activated mic clicks loudly out when it decides transmit , or not . this annoying , but all moreso because when it decides transmit seems absolutely no correlation when there actually sound room . finally , transmission absolutely unintelligible : it marred lot what sounds like digital compression artifacts garble sound -- speech absolutely cannot understood over this monitor . short , no respect this functional product	-1
this monitor makes random beeping sounds so lould we thought it smoke detector . we even replaced our smoke detector thinking it broken only find it this stupid monitor . not but this	-1
i got this bra when i pregnant wore it confortable until my delivery . after my delivery bra too small . engorged breast after delivery just carrying mature milk afterwards it just too small . i wasn't told my breast would get even larger after delivery . i thought they big just before delivery . i decided go w/ bravado bra . it worked out much better . it comfortable wear day night . milk comes out it comfortable either way . sizes more flexable then medela . strap support better then medela . i packed up medela bras just use them during pregnancy if i . no use them when i am not pregnant or breastfeeding . breastfeeding their main purpose	1
i seen this product ( others similar it ) . rn , we encouraged prospective parents refrain drawn " cuteness " items geared only sold , not useful . although each category item this kit certainly useful , some essential , it far better spend your money items purchased separately . this way , you check quality longevity . put together your own kit .	1
this item too small . i kept putting it back windshield but it kept falling down each time . i could not see my baby this tiny mirror . not worth money all	1
i bought this puree my 6 month old daughter homemade baby foods . you put blade bottom cup , load food , then put protective plate finally put top piece ( which contains motor ) top . concept seemed good it compact size . cons : 1 ) cup holds less than 1 cup food ... if you go over amount , any liquids food start splatter through make mess , sometimes causes motor stop running ... guess it shorts it out i wait until it dries out before i start again . if you're trying make enough freez cubes food , you'll puree several batches . 2 ) you only run motor short periods time ... up 20 seconds max or something like some foods . this fine soft foods , but if trying puree meats , example , it sometimes takes longer than it becomes hassle grind , wait , grind , wait .... 3 ) motor powers blade way too slow , cooked chicken or beef ends up too lumpy , since you really need faster blade puree them . i've found pureering baby foods , best thing use blender , since blade speed much faster design helps draw foods down bottom so things get more evenly pureed . don't waste your money buying this	-1
looked nice store . thought adjustable head rest nice touch ... until we got home tried use it . head rest not stay stuck down mat , velcro not strong enough . i would not buy this product again	-1
i like music , but we it auto play . because i mirror seat see my son(he still backward facing ) , i can't move seal up farther so he reach part kick make item turn . also , i never able create bubbles like instructions claim . so just music plays . there plenty other smaller items . this thing also eats up batteries like you wouldn't believe . i am changing them every couple days , we aren't car much . what disappointment !! good concept , but doesn't work well all	1
it worked great first time my 14 month old son used it but second time , he figured out how take lid off spilled his cheerios everywhere . i tried it few more times after got same result . lid way too easy remove .	-1

we bought this bedrail vacation home thought it great first . i realized i didn't like it sticking out so far bed when it folded down , but could live it . second weekend we used it , my 2 year old his cousin , also 2 , climbing into bed stepping bedrail because it stuck out so far , side popped out position , never go back . far i am concerned , this product needs rethought manufacturer . there should some way fix it when it pops out . definitely would not reccommend it . make matters worse , babies us would not return it becuase we no longer reciept	-1
i don't abundance money , but i would definitely pay double if quality sheets better . i don't even want know what thread count these sheets ... what i understand , these only sheets fit thing , so i guess i'm just out luck . hope see alternative these sheets real soon .	-1
doesn't dry your bottles all . it leave condensation doesn't dry completely . i give it one star all stuff it holds , but water leaks out so you put something underneath it .	-1
save your $$ if you plan run this jogging stroller . mild windy day it flips up towards you off side . i didn't think it really shielded my baby sun like i thought it going either . i would not recommend this product . it very cumbersome . when i returned it store , there two others counter behind customer service cashier just returned recently .	-1
we should much more careful read other customers ' negative reviews this crib mattress pad before purchasing three them ( eventually cancelled one ) . we would not recommend this item . after only one wash ( despite followed laundry instruction ) , it shrank so much it became impossible fit our standard crib . when i tried stretch sides around mattress , they tore ..	-1
i bought this item despite review said it too small . big mistake . it small ! it not big enough my 21 months old . i'm very dissapointed because i liked infant version .	-1
i bought this product my 3yr . old . first i thought it would help her go bathroom when we went out but when she sits seat she pinched few times . first she didn't want sit it again amp ; she cried when i took her bathroom , but i told her i would sit her it amp ; i would lift her off . since i doing this she hasn't pinched , but it took me while her trust me . if you buy this product you very careful or your child get pinched	-1
sometimes it works ok . sometimes it stops swinging no reason . sometimes turning mobile instead turn music . it always makes gringing noise when swinging . if it worked like it should it would great product . i like stars projected below- when they work	1
i though it just me but after reading several other reviews i see others agree just how difficult this thing assemble/disassemble . locks impossible , items not quite fit right , it would impossible get this thing into its " travel bag . " mattress thin very lumpy ; each fold this mattress causes hard lumps . i bought this product thinking i could use it portable play yard after my baby out grows co-sleeper aspect but there no way . i recommend you avoid this product !	-1
if you looking make mess , lose milk get frustrated , these bags you . first , these bags no stand up there own it very inconveniant carry little cup around help fill bag . you string twis t-t ie into each bag yourself . also you supposed tear little tab bottom bag get milk out . it not easy . first time i it i lost whole bunch milk . your better off untwisting tie pouring it there . worst thing bag they leaked few times my caregiver warming up milk . this never happened other bags market . my favorite lansinoh . bag thing these medela bags they more expensive than others . pass this try others	-1
i registered received these medela bags . after using all 50 , i got few free lansinoh bags my breast pad purchase . wow !! i never go back medela . reason i registered them because everyone says they strong don't leak . well this only good feature . lansinoh bag strong well , easy close ( double zip-lock vs . medela bothersome twisty ties ) , easy get air out ( unlike medela ) , lansinoh take-up way less room freezer ! stacking medela bags freezer difficult because their shape ... thawing difficult because i see i'll need watch milk doesn't spill out top . lansinoh i won't worry . my medela bags haven't split freezer ... i'll give them . but neither my lansinoh bag .	1
after trying almost every bottle , i tried these waht nightmare ! there many parts clean they leak ! i called dr. brown customer service line they defense said you not shake formula mix it- you stir it . most people who use powder formula know this not option just stiring very slowly they say not mix formula . i saw no difference using these other than they leak pian clean use special brush clean them . i went playtex natural disposables never looked back	-1
i tried fisher-price take-along jungle swing then this open travel swing . both swings my baby would lean forward fold himself half seat . jungle swing difficult haul around since it didn't stay closed well " palm tree " always way . finally i bought fisher-price aquarium swing . i found seat aquarium swing deeper it clicks place ( so it won't fold over baby ) it easier assemble haul around .	-1

this first bottle i purchased my daughter when she born . i breastfeeding but since she jaundice , i suppliment formula first 2 weeks her life ! i worst time this bottle ! it leaked everytime i went shake it whenever i would try feed my daughter she would literaly drown because flow too fast . she would also gag horrible gas ! i stopped formula till she 6 weeks i thought maybe since she older she could take it little better . it ended up same problems again !! i switched playtex nurser those bottles great ! i would recommend them anyone who breast bottle feeding ! my daughter not get confused she not drown formula ! even though it little more work drop system , i dont care ! i push air out bottle she swallows less air she less gas spits up less !	-1
i really disappointed this " sealy ultra " . it not feel like very good mattress . we'll use this couple months replace it something better . i'd say you need see mattress , decide one you want then look best price internet	1
i bought this item preparation my first child . i tried it 8 times me my husband got different reading each time , 94.2 - 102.3 !! i returned it next day , don't bother !	-1
this thermometer not very accurate or consistant . whenever my son sick we used this it would give normal temperature reading i knew it couldn't right . we would take our sons temperature 3 times row never get same reading twice . i even check my own temperature it would come up crazy readings like 95.1 ! we got rid this one because fever-induced seizures run my husbands family we needed something more accurate . it my experience nothing digital gives accurate readings old-fashion oral rectal thermometers work best	-1
i use this work where i infants up toddlers , we repeat process 3 times before we ever get accurate reading . under arm , old traditional thermomaters better	-1
my son 8 months old . he outgrown his infant car seat , now larger seat , but still rear facing . i bought cradler prevent his head slumping forward when he falls asleep seat . it not help this regard all . fact , it just annoys him . i taken it off car seat entirely , i'm not using it all . very disappointed californi	-1

great idea , but very time-consuming put . my advice use regular maya type sling first few months , then get patapum . it least pricey " structured " carriers which only ones put weight your hips , rather than your shoulders , therefore spare your spine .	1
my 11 week old breastfed baby diagnosed mild acid reflux ( she doesn't vomit , it comes up her throat causing crying spells heartburn ) . she also sensitive stomach gassy so we decided try these when she 8 weeks old . they horrible ! we like playtex premium nurser playtex ventaire ( chubby bottles ) much better . we tried regular dr. browns , but she choked nipple so we ordered chubby bottle nipples more like breast . both kinds she sucked too hard ate too fast ... when i sat her up burp her after her usual 5 minutes (@ one ounce playtex bottles ) , my surprise she already sucked down 3 ounces ! we horrible night both times we tried dr. browns - she cried all night bad tummy ache fast flow ( we used slow flow nipples even ! ) . i also friend same problem her baby choking gagging slow flow nipples ' too-fast-flow ( formula fed baby ) . i highly recommend playtex bottles - they easy clean never leak . we only tried dr. brown see if it would alleviate gerd symptoms - it not !!!!	-1
we all clear swing gate ( hardware-mounted , not pressure-mounted ) installed top our basement stairs . earlier this evening , i opened lock , gate swung out over stairs , top hinge snapped off wall gate tipped away under my hand . fortunately , enough my weight behind me i able correct my balance ( just ! ) not fall headfirst down stairs . but it close thing . inch or pound or second either way i -- or , god forbid , one our children -- would certainly badly injured . while i taking photograph broken hinge , gate itself , which hanging precariously its remaining hinge , fell off tumbled down stairs . gate place six weeks , but only actual use tiny fraction time we out house five those weeks . nb this product failure , not installation fault . screws still firmly attached wall , what remains plastic flanges around appropriate holes hinge . i purchased gate after reading enthusiastic reviews here , but after my experience tonight , i would not recommend anybody buy this gate , ever . ( review gives one star , because no stars not option ) . i would expect see product recall very soon	-1
i also older diaper champ it broke so i got this new one , " new improved " ! i don't know if they've ever tested this product . it impossible get diaper bag out diaper champ . it big bottom small top so when you try get bag out it , it always gets stuck if you try harder then bag rips ! it absolutely horrible product . new or soon moms - not buy this !!	-1

we bought this monitor year ago replace one we gotten yard sale it seemed work great first , however after 2 months 1st receiver , ( it came two ) , just suddenly stoped working ! i thought maybe one our family members got water it or something because it kept kitchen , but sure enough few months later other receiver we kept our bedroom just suddenly stoped working ! there must some kind defect production these things because i see reading other reviews we're not only family problems . save yourself headache purchase different brand/model	1
same thing happened me person previous review . they sent pink pillow instead crib set , not honor same price bedding set . i send it back they give refund . what hassle	-1
i winter baby i can't begin imagine what i would without this item . i personally inspired 2 other new moms purchase this already well . absolute best thing you never put coat child . what time-saver if you woman on-the-go like myself . i excited right before i my baby girl they came out new limited version . i diva color my little i get lot compliments look ease use . i disagree others who thought it difficult adjust item around harness straps it cheaply made . i installed sack made adjustment one-time . material allows weather some liquids just roll right off fabric . i would consider this must any firs t-t ime moms ( i ) their registry . price definitely lot higher than i would like see it , but still must if you afford make purchase .	-1
i three kids , third time , i am utterly dissapointed avent product . each new child , we bought fresh supply bottles , hoping avent fixed this problem . we really wanted these bottles work , they seem most durable stylish ones market , our kids never any problems nipples . however , each time , we ended up switch brand . leak not just spot here or there . it often torrential downpour , leaking out sides white cap . i know many people who same problem . expensive these bottles , i would think avent would take more pride their product , fixing such simple things leak . don't waste your money	-1
my seat brand new i love it , but it already quick working . i've changed batteries reapeatedly it still only works occassionaly . it won't vibrate all music only plays sometimes . very disappointed .	1

i washed cover first time it didn't hold up . ends frayed there even holes where elastic band attaches terry . also little pieces terry got all over everything else i washed it . i'm extremely disappointed this product	-1
when your infant crying because he hungry you're only thinking how you want back bed , you not necessarily hear very quiet " click " reviewer mentioned unless you right top this unit . it already cycle through once ? twice ? i don't know . i never could catch it since it my kitchen i usually trying soothe my child living room when light went out . yes , it plain sight , but doesnt mean i caught it right time . what i know leaving bottle there , reagrdless it 4oz . or 8oz ., makes formula very hot . even if you it proper setting according instructions . then you wait it cool down before feeding your now screaming hungry baby . this went trash . only reason i gave it two stars because it heat bottle faster than if i waited water boil . otherwise , i just started giving my son formula made room temperature water not one problem	1
this tub waste money . i bought it this evening i'm returning tub first thing tomorrow morning . water leaks hinges creating mess slippery , unsafe floor . very unsatisfied this product	-1
first i really liked these , until i realized my baby just used 100 liners 1 week . it not easy squeeze air out . since i keep track how much our baby eats , how i when liner all scrunched up ! not worth money liners there plenty air gets into liner even if once while you manage get air out . i'm sorry i ever bought them	1
i bought this my daughter when she 1 year old . i could barely zip it around b/c it so small . i keep checking tags make sure i got right size not infant one . i looked some other reviews saw many people same problem . it great product smaller children	1
we purchased 2 these seats give grandparents when my son came visit them . right out box , seat pad wouldn't stay seat slides around during use . i figured i could live since it just cheap seat anyway . after only 5 or 6 uses however , clip holds seat belt adjuster booster snapped while installing seat into our second car few days ago . i tried contact evenflo report this problem , but they completely unconcerned failure their product . they told me they only warranty seat 90 days purchase ( you proof purchase ) . they offer send me out replacement part , but under circumstances , i don't feel comfortable using seat all , so i'll destroying disposing it . i explained we thinking replacing seat different evenflo model asked if discount coupon available reduce cost replacing defective seat , but they told me out warranty it no longer their problem . thank goodness this part failed while installing seat not during crash , or my son certainly would seriously injured . we haven't any problems yet other seat , but i'll replacing it anyway just safe . after their horrible customer service , i won't buying evenflo anything ever again .	-1
well women selling this product decided after she already sold me this car seat she was'nt makeing any money off it , so she decided not sell it me . so i never got this car seat . i really don't understand why i need write review it	-1
i bought this mirror because my son hates ride car . i thought lights music would distract him . after 1 minute hearing this annoying lady sing , i decided i would really rather hear my son cry . it far less irritating . remote completely useless because you press button mirror order remote work . what genius engineered ? also , it heavy it folds center after place 15 minutes . don't waste your money !!	-1
don't bother these . they expensive only 4 bottles totally unnecessary . it much easier buy storage bags . if you pumping full time , you storing alot more than 4 bottles time . i also found i not like these bottles feeding because they nothing prevent air entering baby belly result gas or worse , colic . they also flow too fast newborns	1
this sling very difficult use i could never get it adjusted correctly never figured out how breastfeed it without obvious . i used this sling 6 weeks it just killed my shoulder back . it uncomfortable not nearly enough padding shoulders . plus you still carry diaper bag and/or purse so just added extra weight . don't waste money i would much rather front/back carrier they work so much better easier use feel lot safer . only things i like pockets strap keep small things like paci , keys , money cell .	1
we bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived . we previously used diaper genie , we no longer - it worked fine , but expensive . we decided buy diaper dekor because odor free guarantee . don't buy it . guarantee or pail ! it stinks up whole house just one or two diapers it . we kept it garage , also outside . not convenient . refills expensive . worse yet - my one year old get dirty diapers out it through top - or get bag through door front !!! who designed this thing ???	-1
this product nice first but you'll find yourself time time again replacing it just so you don't put anymore holes your home . i've bought 5 them over 4 years . we expanding family this things keeps breaking . not buy , buy something better higher quality so you won't replace 6 months . please listen this review . it save you	-1
please spend your money different gate . there nice wooden stair gates out there seem pricey first , but after going through what we gone through , i wish i would gotten different gate . we twin girls bi-level house . stair gate must . 90 day warranty joke , because naturally , each gate broke after 90 days . same problem all four - knob just wont turn . i say - when it worked , it nice . but read other reviews , you see same problem over over again . shame me buying it again . it just broke this past saturday , after six months use . i contact manufacturer , but past , i'm sure i won't get anywhere . if enough people complain , perhaps they change design . again , please look elsewhere	-1
i wouldn't let my dog sleep these sheets . they worst quality imaginable . we took ours back purchased plain ole porta crib sheets they fit perfectly . i recommend koala baby name brand porta rib sheet . they available bru elastic all way around , making snug fit . quality 1000 times improved over pnp sheets	-1
i bought this right before my daughter born used it every day since she born 4 months ago . week ago it just stopped working . i really liked this steamer it served me well but now just not turning anymore . so i went out bought exact same steamer . i used it 2 days then third day , yesterday , it wouldn't turn anymore . i'm taking it back today getting something else	1
i accidentally ordered this one instead kolcraft universal carrier , since they both called universal carrier . this car seat carrier over-engineered too many moving parts completely unnecessary . rather than returning it , my husband wanted eat $59.99 plus shipping beating it up baseball hat . we went out purchased kolcraft universal carrier -- it much simpler , easier fold , large , functional basket underneath car seat .	-1
i ordered this item . i bought directly baby universe before , but now i've several problems . i ended up cancelling this order because after i inquired baby universe , i told item backordered . they didn't know when it would available . i also ordered jj cole bundle me lite them . it arrived fairly quickly , but slashed through box cutter . i've trying get it exchanged , but their customer service lacking . i won't exchange it am trying just get return now . i'm not so sure i would buy this company . they seem slipping - perhaps they can't quite handle amount business they getting . disappointing . just got ra number item , but it shipped back jj cole who knows when i'll get item shipped me . they don't even give you address ship returned item . won't let me return . this bad way run business	-1
i need something i use top regular dresser , but this one i don't particularly feel safe use because it velcr o-o sides , 6 pieces wouldn't stay place when baby tries roll his side . also it fold line center not very comfortable babies back , cushion kinda sinks area . diaper cloth cover came it made cheap looking dirty white fabric . it looks used even when its not . which also not fit snugly pad . belt looks flimsy generally useless , especially when velcr o-o sides pad wiggles around unstable . i purchased changing pad childkraft . it way better than this one , just one solid well made piece so much stable over dresser purpose	-1
important : find mobile option it working , while silent w/out music . i thought this mobile great first 5 minutes , but then i quickly realized , i couldn't get thing shut up- darn it- they didn't put option it ! how this ? it $40+ dollar mobile . my baby just wanted see it go , but music , sliding beads put him over edge . this mobile too loud , sliding beads loud well . it stimulates baby too much . even after covering it up arranging it under bumper pad- it still too loud . motion actually quite hypnotizing great , but " tiny love " ruined it not putting " silent running feature button " it . i'd pay $60 it if it would just quiet !!! if this mobile worked without sound it would wonderful . it now , i can't use it much- only when baby his happiest . even then , mobile wears him out- ruins his happy state , because it too loud . i think i shall pry it open try break speaker . i am serious . i rated it one star , because i only use it when my baby his most rested happiest state . if he least bit tired , it overstimulates him makes him cry .	-1
this worst sunshade ever !!! don't waste your money . it so flimsy it offers no sun protection all . we used it our double jogger stroller but it just flopped down into faces our babies . i not recommend this product . i only gave it one star because zero star not option	-1
well lets see i ordered this product my sons birthday ... which way 14th january . well i think its 2nd feb . still hadn't received it , but i get chair ..??? anyway so i called canceled when i got chair , money never placed back into my account , i told it would put monday so tuesday i felt safe writing check would include money ... my bank went overdrawn like 200 dollars .. fees ( i realize it my fault believing reputable company like amazon ! ) . now its month i call youall back you say it should sent out me this week , though this only email i get you .... how should i rate damn table when i havent recieved it .... i mean put yourself my situaition ... how would you rate it	-1
size stated 3-6 months . baby 2 months old hat too small . anyone ordering should consider it runs very small . then because i used my credit card purchase it i unable return it get refund	1
this seemed like great idea but it doesn't work very well cloth diaper users , like me . i use top shelf wipes warmer side pockets grooming items such brush cotton swabs . however , since my cloth diapers won't fit into diaper organizer , i'm not sure what put there . because this , there lot wasted space . i would not recommend this product if you use cloth diapers	1
monitor itself works fine -- but not if you plan using ac adapter ..... fisher price customer service recommends ac adapter should not plugged into reciever more than 13 hours time or rechargeable battery and/or unit damaged . my mind makes product useless if you intend using ac adapter -- you'll remember unplug it every morning or risk wrecking thing ! ( fisher price rep actually told me i'd " fry it " ) .	1
i bought this potty because i thought it soooo cute , looking like real toilet toilet paper roll everything ! i still think it cute , but just like many other reviewers say , all music talking sounds way too distracting able actually learn potty training . , like other reviewers say , sensor not accurate , so it always saying child went potty when they didn't . very confusing child who trying learn really " go " potty . we're currently potty training our daughter , we three training potties -- this one , older one soft seat , one fits into ring big toilet -- this potty last one my daughter pick when it " potty time . " when we first got it she blast it , using it toy nothing more . now newness worn off , she shows very little interest it . if i it over , i would given her this potty without batteries it without her even knowing it capability make all sounds . here suggestion : don't put batteries until your child mastered potty training . then , reward his/her accomplishment , put batteries show your child what potty . training part out way , sounds won't such distraction anymore	1
i bought this sling when my son 8 months old 19 pounds . he hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around see world . i hated this carrier because rigid straps cut into my hips shoulder every time he tried move . seller recommended making sure straps place correctly ( i tried numerous positions . there isn't place your body where unforgiving straps particularly comfortable ) also said tighten straps so baby couldn't move around . i all these things still found it very uncomfortable wear . seller helpful product arrived promptly , so i gave it 2 stars instead 1 . there $5 return charge .	1
we purchased this stroller because weight ( 10lbs ) ease lifting it/out car . two weeks after purchasing stroller we noticed stitching sun shade already coming apart . shade barely big enough shield anything , let alone provide protection child . we received replacement cover , but advised this would one time replacement . tiny cup holder not big enough hold bottle already broken off . our 8 mo . old 17 lbs . stroller very difficult maneuver . straight paths , great . if you take turn or change direction quickly , not plan stroller transition your directional shift . front wheels get stuck you kick them back forward or stroller not steer correctly when you going straight . pliko previously my 4 yr old , we thought we could trust name peg perego . unless you seeking light weight stroller not maneuver well , we woud not recommend this stroller anyone .	-1
somehow we ended up no less than three strollers : nice zooper 3-wheel outdoors stroller , maclaren umbrella stroller , middle this red peg perego aria stroller . we nothing but bad news this aria stroller . what clunker ! italian , i am ashamed say this confirms me stereotype they make nothing works but everything looks fabulous . i am only slightly facetious . this stroller very sleek stylish , light-weight , but where it all ends . biggest flaw poor handling/wheels . pushing steering constant battle . sometimes it just doesn't want go . i really tried inspect where problem , it not look like wheels stick . rather , whole body seems flex too much when you push stroller . just gently rock stroller side side you see what i mean . other nits include aria stickers coming loose eventually needing torn off , baby cup holder both too shallow too easily removable . but biggest problem handling --- it not pleasant we never use it anymore .	-1
my neighbor nojo liked it so i going get one too . i tried hers , but i couldn't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn't seem safe hurt my back . i thought i could order different size , but found it only comes one size . i then read all reviews here followed someone advice ordered babymoon slings . it fit me better ( i'm petite ) lot easier use ( prettier ! ) . i think it makes big difference get sling that not bulky comes sizes - i don't get why they use so much padding nojo , it makes it really hard use newborn compared other slings .	-1
i think idea behind sling great but it not every baby . everytime our son put this he crys or screams . he easy going fellow but he hasn't liked held closely . he wants his freedom this doesn't give much freedom newborn . also , quot ; trainingquot ; video more promotional advertisement . i go web site get more information how use it	-1
" breathe safe padded sheet " also left mesh imprint my baby face . placing sheet over breathe safe pad defeats purpose lessening current routine : 1 ) untying bumper guard moving it out way2 ) struggling " pull " out heavy mattress crib3 ) removing washing sheet mattress pad4 ) wiping off mattress soap water5 ) replacing sheet mattress pad6 ) returning heavy mattress crib7 ) re-arranging dust ruffle8 ) re-tying bumper guardother than , it seemed like good idea . searching better product .	-1

bought this crib tent after reading all " fine print " returns . besides , toilet seats etc . which allegro medical not allow returns due hygenic reasons , allegro medical made it appear you make returns within 30 days . not when i tried return this . allegro medical said all returns " up their discretion " . they would not allow me return this despite fact i didn't even open box . very misleading never buy allegro medical again	-1
i so anxious get this when i finally , my daughter just not interested it . she barely plays it . i hoping this she would spend more time her tummy because she normally hates . maybe that why she didn't care much this .	1
we bought this product so i could see my 6 month old son front seat . but everytime i put rear view mirror back window it would pop off hit my son face . blinds don't stay up either . their suctions don't stay if there any moisture your windows when you shut your car door .	-1

this wipe warmer not function simply because lid won't stay closed . i waste time trying get lid closed while my baby crying changing table . wipes cool off dry out because poorly designed flimsy lid . don't buy this wipe warmer , there better ones out there .	-1

don't buy this stroller . only good thing it you won't sad if you leave it somewhere . " restraints " don't restrain all . my one year old twins barely stay it so when we're store they reach very far pull down all sorts things . ( not safe ) stroller barely fits through regular door ways - i mean barely fits . it not maneuver well all difficult stear . " adult drink cup holder " snaps off when struggling go through doors i don't describe what mess . i'm just lucky i don't drink hot coffee ; otherwise i would suing manufacturer burns children . there no storage . " saddle bags " hold few small things but you should only use it things you don't mind children able reach . this stroller not only nuisance , it potentially dangerous features , so please don't buy it	-1
i very disappointed this pump . it very loud stopped working after 3 weeks , i only used it once day . even more disappointing companys return policy . you ship it them your expense , wait them send you new one , return one store . not waste your time	-1

i swear -this crime ! worst product western hemisphere . never , never buy this piece garbage	-1
i'm big believer reading amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray ! but this chair ( which we bought specifically because everyone praise ) miserable ! i don't understand why it got such high marks ... tray way too huge easy cleaning it ( rather than chair ) " leg separator , " which means you can't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over place . we've also found tray extremely difficult hook onto chair , doesn't push towards baby belly far enough . addition , clips attach harness filled grooves can't cleaned well , so they're beyond gross , just after few feedings . all baby things we wish we'd never bought , this number one list ... i can't help feeling if we'd just closed our eyes pointed random high chair , we would better than this thing ... only reason it gets one star because i appreciate non-obnoxious print -- it nice not something display clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors . ;	-1
very disappointed . i bought this hopes relief pain pressure after i pulled pelvic muscle 30 weeks pregnant . it not helped me annoying . l-xl too large but s-m too small . material folds rolls under my clothes there nowhere extra flap material front go . i get sweaty underneath it it difficult get my underwear back under it after using bathroom --- which i'm obviously doing frequently 34 weeks ! this only pregnancy belt available shop i went . i wish i'd chance try others compare	1
i owned bed it very dangerous child . i am stunned this product still market . while it very cute , fairly priced you hardly get what you pay . my daughter loved look this --- her first " big girl " bed . until it fell pieces her it ! metal rails hold bed together , matress place , not properly planned out . if you even manage get this bed built --- which difficult , much more so than it seems first ---- metal support bars fall out when child gets into bed . it flimsy , poorly designed , dissapointing , dangerous . delta should ashamed	-1
i purchased this bed online last year . it looks great we all know our daughters love dora . however , bed disaster put together if your not handy , you would problably give up . rods come bed not stay holes , very active 3 year old this bed not last 3 months . #60 ; br / #62 ; what waste money , invest bed your child growth , something withstand active lifestyle average child	-1
i purchased this gate keep my daughter out kitchen . unfortunately every time you walk through swing gate you readjust it , which makes it impossible close one hand . even if you don't care one-hand feature , it still hassle adjust . i not suggest buying this gate .	-1
i thought this would great size . changing pad just very thin piece plastic . it provides no padding all . case itself padded . why didn't they use padding changing " pad " instead case ? very uncomfortable baby . ( it basically like laying out piece paper . ) i'd rather use those small padded things come most diaper bags	-1
i am previous britax owner . i purchased britax roundabout my daughter when she 4 months . 18 months she only 5 inches outgrowing it . since we such plesant experience roundabout we decided stay britax brand purchase marathon olivia print . i very dissapointed . i major issue straps comming loose while we driving . when we would get our destination straps so loose there virtually nothing holding her into her seat . huge scare any parent thought what could happen when you slam your brakes . it also lacked supurb comfort britax boasts . my daughter never comfortable marathon she her roundabout . rubber things go over straps also incredibly annoying . constantly slid down out place end trip chest clip my childs lap . coupled straps comming loose defentially not expected britax high saftey standards . i went through quite fiaso returning this seat after 3 returns i bought eddie bauer seat instead . so far i no complaints . i wouldn't waste my money this . buy roundabout if you want britax name , but please dont bother this marathon	1
this product waste my money . it very difficult put very difficult use . my husband tore it off day after we got it . i would rather use duck tape then this product :) :	-1
i bought this pump because it medela name i thought it reliable . i wrong . this worst pump world . everything other poster said true . this worst breastpump . i would not recommend this breastpump anyone	-1
my daughter placed this crib her registry , mainly because price . she didn't want anyone spending $500.00 crib this one matched style she looking . i found this set up " depot " store it beautiful sturdy , but didn't come natural . so i went home ordered it online . it arrived 4 days before shower(8 days early eta)but it shattered . first 3 pieces we looked split , chipped crushed . quite surprize considering box wasn't bad shape . we decided return it buy more expensive model(at local specialty store ) . amazon return policy amazing , click mouse next day ups picks up . no packing labels print , no lugging big heavy items post office , very simple . amazon gets 5 stars , storkcraft - 0	-1
we so excited try jumper our son , but very dissapointed this product . first all , he tipped himself right out it ! three strap design , it unsturdy back , which we discovered after he spilled himself onto floor . he seemed pretty intent jumping , so now we've tried stuffing him there blanket so he nice snug , but it still unstable wobbly . i don't recommend this product , fact , we going try different brand	-1
though this potty nicely priced , it worth it buy more expensive one . though mine hasn't fallen apart like other reviewers , it shift around base , allowing spillage . removeable receptacle base way too far actual seat , so my daughter gets stuff all over inside , not just receptacle . inside criss-crossed honeycomb type pattern(see my customer image)so it impossible clean messes out it . it serve it purpose potty , but i'm definatly going buy different one when my son old enough one	1
i've tried this sling 4 times my now 10 week-old son . i just can't get it work so he seems comfortable . he usually cries when he it . he fell asleep it once , but he looked so contorted . it just so tight against my body it bends him wrong way . pocket so deep it closes over his head . i know i got correct size . i've given up am looking better sling . right now we use our baby bjorn several times day , he loves it , but it little cumbersome , i want him able recline .	1
this sling only useful couple months because there no adjustable strap . there so many slings out there more functional you use newborn toddle	1
only good thing i really say this seat it comes pink . it hard find carseats not really ugly . otherwise i cannot take my newborn out without help because this seat not recline far enough back her head flops forward . i returning work couple weeks bringing her me ( i'm nanny ) i don't know how we going it may purchase new seat already . i would think if something deemed " infant "' carseat it should work correctly safely birth not when baby hold their head up	-1
freedom potty trainer looked like such good idea , but plastic very flimsy , when set place , it just barely reaches floor . it pretty unstable situation . separate kids toilet seat footstool would far better	-1
these bowls not worth money . they not stay table all !	-1
i agree water holder bit tedious fill measure acurately . i always follow measuring instructions , but sometimes bottle too cool or too hot , even though i practicing get it right . i wish it more accurate someone like me , who only 3 room apartment , cooling feature not useful	1
not only product get delivered 3 days later than expected , my child grandfather who construction industry installed seat entire set broke off bowl first time anyone sat it . nobody this household overweight	-1
i received this seat gift my baby shower , i thought it going great seat , graco market several years , it built up reputation . but i wrong ! everytime i would go out my newborn , i would make turn , seat would flip over side , it not matter how slow i made turn it would always same thing . i'm very carefull driver , specially after i gave birth my son . you can't imagine how horrible it , look throuhg rearview mirror , see your tiny little precious bundle joy , flipped over his head hanging . i would look place park , fix him seat . i move both passenger driver seat far back possible , order hold baby seat backrest , just so it wouldn't tip over , it made it little difficult drive . you might say , she probably didn't install it well , but you would wrong , it perfectly installed , i someone check installation my city , everything fine . base seat not completely flat , making it difficult seat stay place . this not just happen me , it also happened my sister her baby seat , we our children few weeks difference . i get different seat , i purchased one flatter base , one worked perfectly . i never buy graco seat again , i believe it worth spending more money better seat , i believe ones children priceless , investing money their safety	-1
same thing happened previous poster happened my son toy . turtle cup came off after first use ( within 20 min ! ) . my son 8 months old it can't even withstand pulling 8 month old . sharp screw revealed when cup comes off . luckily we noticed it before my son injured , unfortunately i remove it immediately which course upset my son , who no longer his toy play . i would pay more something quality so it sad amazing companies put out cheap quality products break immediately expose dangerous parts . i would recommend you not buy this item . i now waste more time returning it store	-1
my son ten days old . i tried these bottles highly disappointed . liners pain butt . once you prepare bottle get air out it , if your child not drink whole bottle it collects air again . i changed dr. brown bottles my son less gas isn't wearing his food .	-1
i using my medela pump past 5 months ( first couple months intermittently last 2 1/2 months daily ) . suddenly it broke down without any warning signs weekend . my dealer not open replace it this caused considerable loss milk supply me . thankfully dealer local dealer very good . he replaced " just pump " pack new one . per medela instructions , they actually want send broken pump over them they take care it , if it under yr old . it would very late me if i ship it they ship it back . thing happening my back pack handles started wearing down . i hardly carry them around . i am giving it 1 star because poor quality check must carried out such expensive pump . i would think twice before buying this	-1
like you , i read all reviews i could bottles , travel systems , baby swings , cribs , etc etc etc . i loved shape these bottles ( very handy when needing your hand - you prop bottle under your chin while feeding ) , concept " ventaire " system made lot sense ! however , 2 months into using these bottles , i became fed up wash all different parts , drying them thoroughly ( it must these things ) , " activate " both nipples ventaire plastic seal ; wasting valuable time energy should've spent my family , catching up laundry , cleaning house , cooking , grabbing naps in-between ( i also work full-time job didn't get home till 6 pm every night ) . worst all it if you don't install vent juuuuuuust so , it leaks ... person ( below ) who said it doesn't leak if you screw it right , hasn't met me - i'm 34 years old believe i learned how screw stupid cap ! it " hit or miss " deal ... sometimes i would go whole week without leak then out blue ... water everywhere !!! ( they're slow leaks too , so it not like you would notice right away ... it took like 30 minutes before showing ) then i called playtex ask them what problem , they thought my water might too hot breaking down material ... so , they kindly sent me some new ones . well , yeh , didn't work either !!! it great idea , but very bad design !!! i finally threw my hands air ... purchased evenflo version " angled bottle " now i am heaven !!! yourself , your time , favor don't waste money	-1
i thought this cover horrible . it doesn't cover enough area cart . it difficult put because all ties . i couldn't even get harness fit right . try one other seat covers instead elastic , you put them cart one hand , it completely covers cart , even big ones costco	-1
i bought this cover thinking anything cover cart would same . other covers i've seen just slip , this one tied . also , it doesn't cover entire cart . there opening , my baby fingers always find , where he touch icky cart handle . not great product . spend extra money buy better one	1
i just received this sleep positioner today it nothing like what i expected . description makes it sound like wedge adjustable - but i don't quite get how adjust this . it also says there blanket . maybe i misunderstood description because there no blanket here . i imagined wedge would prop baby up much more than it . thickest layer wedge maybe 2 1/2 inches thick . i'm pretty disappointed . i thought this going answer my baby sleep problems	1
i never written review , but this case , i feel compelled so . i purchased imonitor last week upgrade safety 1st dual monitor , no other reason than i tired interference . i excited learn digital technology , once i got it home , i anxious try it . after few nights trying it out , i equally anxious return it get my money back ... let me explain : begin , before you buy , please aware lights sound awfully bright loud , which troublesome since i am light sleeper . i would able deal it , but there other problems well ... there ' clicks ' ' crackles ' intermittent , , like i said before , not good light sleeper . final straw fourth night parent receivers lost contact base -- i spent half hour resetting it , reconfiguring layout , powering on/off -- all no avail . it kept beeping ' out range ' -- i only 10 feet monitor time . absolutely unacceptable . all fairness , we lot gadgets wireless may competing monitor , but isn't excuse .. it says ' crystal clear clarity ' ' 2000 foot range ' , but this not , i repeat , not case . so , i packed it back up went into babies us return it ... here kicker : salesperson store said she agreed they lot problems she seen more imonitors returned than any other monitor . she rec'd sony , but it doesn't come two parent units , so i resigned myself living safety 1st .. even all its interference , it still superior , 1/4 price imonitor . i no doubt digital next step baby monitors ... but so far graco not it figured out ... save your money give it some time so they work out obvious flaws system .	-1
i purchased this sterilizer two weeks ago , i used it all two times . it creates horrible mess water running everywhere when lid lifted , i really wonder if bottles actually sterilized . i am terribly disappointed this product , truly caution those you who thinking buying this run it like wind	-1
both my children get thrush very easy so i purchased this product sterilize bottles nipples every use . my kids still get thrush this product terribly messy bottle look horrible afterwards . if my kids keep getting thrush , obviously this product not work	-1
i given this gift , so thankfully i didn't waste my money it . this sterilizer so messy awkward , i not recommend it all . metal pan started corroding after only week . little flecks metal water soak bottom unit lifting off cover drench your countertop . all bottles nipples breastpump parts stay wet spotty , so i can't imagine how it could possibly clean . horrible product	-1
i received box shower gift , they worked okay , unless i changed them lot though , they ended up leaking . i resigned just living wet spots , until someone gave me some lansinoh pads try . i no idea why babies us doesn't arry them , but they really need . these things absolutely not leak , they hold tons liquid	1
we own two these they never easy use . we tore holes first one trying insert seat . we kept it though . we bought our second trip zippers broke off . we would not buy this one again . we large carseats - they both britax marathons	-1
we pregnant our baby due two weeks . we bought mattress our delta marisa white crib , ( you guessed it ) it doesn't fit . i read review poster here it says it doesn't fit their thomas tank engine toddler bed . poster assumed it may fit baby crib , but honest truth ; its one inch ( possibly more ) off . inch enough our baby foot get stuck it , mattress feels like joke , its too cushiony . we regret not reading reviews before buying it . if this mattress doesn't fit majority cribs/beds , then what it good	-1
i love how soft cuddly this changing pad cover . i also appreciate how many colors it comes . what i am disappointed durability . i 3 these used them just over year . they totally falling apart elastic . now , keep mind we use disposable " chucks " ( those blue hospital disposable under pads ) top this terry cloth changing pad . it makes it less messy ( especially early ) doesn't require washing much . i also washed them cold water baby dreft detergent , hung them dry rotated 3 covers we . while it nice product while it lasts , i just expected them more durable .	1
i say i just 20 min ago recieved this cover mail , ( i ordered online because i'm so far babies us location ) i excited first . color great , cover fit perfectly , but i haven't washed it yet . actually i return mine already because manufacturer defect fabric . fabric immediately shred elastic one area(middle long side ) . i plan exchange this cover same , i hope better luck next one , but man , hassle mail this back sit wait just frustrating	1
okay start . this car seat looks good paper but it . when it arrived box completely smashed car seat already tear it . if you latch system your car you must find , shove all belts inside seat . then pull them out correct places . not so easy . then order attach it base you must pull out metal bar once seat attached , slide it back . this very hard . so once there together it pain take apart . facing backwards , if seat not level your car seats , use towel or blanket . you shouldn't . plus my baby it his feet still squished into rear seat . once you turn it forward , get belts adjusted , you press button bottom car seat pull them towards you . this would work fine if base wasn't holding them so you can't move them . we took car seat off base so we could adjust belts . what point . once it your car way you want it suit it purpose but i highly suggest buying something better quality .	-1
i tried use these relieve pain but they not work me . they hot course they also showed right through any top i wearing . i too much company after my baby use these they required too much work attention	-1
volume control this totally lame . i can't get it quite enough put crib bedtime . also , sound quality poor general . i suppose it ok just playing room , but definitely not bed . you probably get something better sound quality comprable price	-1
we received this item xmas gift last year within 4 months legs broken . my two year old twin boys loved playing table but sadly durability this product very poor . legs very unstable upon receipt item . we extremely dissapointed which unusual it step 2 product .	-1
i recently purchased this gate opening my home 68 inches wide . within one week use , wood splintered apart center rendering it completely unusable . i am returning gate puchasing more expensive metal type . this gate perfect example getting what you pay	-1
this stroller made very cheap material . merely after few months light use , stroller already hard push , wheels easily stuck whenever i try make turn . even less than half-an-inch road bump , i physically get front stroller lift front wheels order get pass . shopping basket touches ground whenever road little uneven , outside fabrics already worn out . not mention , sun shades no use all because they too small . without buying extention shade , they practically just some decoration make this product more look like stroller . it definitely not worth price . btw , their customer service terrible well .	-1
if you walking straight without turning then this stroller good you . but just try turning especially sharp turns--you'll stalling getting stuck entire way .	1
i bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags it less expensive . well , i learned my lessen- you get what you pay . like some other reviews spring my top broke which supposed keep claw , if you , closed after you put diaper keep smell . i changed bag often but pail still absorbed awful smell after cleaning it soaking it , it still stunk ! i am now my second child decided buy diaper genie . i hope this work out much better	-1
pro : inexpensive use regular household 13 gallon garbage bags . add any odor disk available cup provided . con : not mask odors . i 8 month old triplets it doesn't help all . even one baby , change bag daily waste big bag unless one baby goes through tons diapers day . my triplets they still don't fill bin day , every other day . i original diaper genie my 10 year old but thought against using it since we'd buy refill bags so much more often triplets . old genie doesn't hold much but it sure holds smell better . if i it over again , i would not buy this pail , which i bought two , one upstairs one down . if smell isn't problem you , go it . but if you're picky smell , research something else	1
problems i this gate : 1 . instructions using template install hinges , fixed gate , not easy understand . i finally gave up i improvised . doing so , installation went more smoothly . 2 . gate not sturdy . if anyone bump into it , i'm pretty sure it would break . 3 . mechanism click/unclick lock more difficult than it should . fortunately , people who using it , strong enough grip get it work . despite these flaws , however , this gate serve its purpose , my case . i bought this gate keep my dogs confined room --- which it . they don't go near gate , so fortunately , i don't worry them leaning , or jumping , it . locking mechanism , it annoying , i'm just hoping it doesn't get any worse . this gate would not safe kids	1
this flimsiest gate ever . boot it not cheap . i couldn't even use screws came gate . i use nails duck tape . instructions wrong sizing it up fit your area it took me over 1 hour put it together . unfortunately when i bought this gate , there only 2 reviews posted - one good one not so good . so i little confused but i needed swing gate . so needless say - i wanted make sure i put my comments so no one else get swindled . this gate isn't even worth $1.0	-1
these retail now $229 bru . just ridiculous . i own one , bought it ebay $28 since it local pickup only sale . i got heckuva deal , i'll admit ! this fantastic carseat ..... but folks , it just infant carseat ! i went looking ebay one , since , babies before , i couldn't fathom shelling out even $100 cheapo , often-recalled graco , let alone $229 peg perego ! all new babies sweat car seats .... they can't maintain their own body temp until 4 months age , which when they grow out these seats ( unless your back goes first ) :) . i understand precautions car seats car accidents ..... folly infant gear industry . if car seats accidents , they're junk folks ..... they aren't re-saleable condition . when last time you heard car accident involving baby ? because how many new parents newborns who would buy $229 carseat ( read : first child ) go out further than trip store ? it regular old car seat . they can't much these , really , except change fabric . they pretty much prey your fear surrounding your new pride joy , so they gauge you your emotions .... hey , i'm sucker too ! infant seats notoriously small , so you buy up next size faster . they get your money car seat then stroller , before you out hazy new parent fog wise up . save your money ..... your baby or your back muscles grow out this 4 months , no matter what ..... then it $229 right down drain , faster than speeding bullet ..... guess you save it baby #2 . think it this way ... same amount money , buy britax roundabout it last 4 years versus 4 months , or go ebay buy one these , 4 months old pretty much brand new , less than half new price	1

i thought this bathtub would best thing , because shower spa feature . but shower so hard use , it so hard push button hold shower head same time . you also worry your baby falling off or sliding down off sling , beacause it just not positiioned right , it sits too high up , she just looks uncomfortable it . you also worry your baby hurting their toes shower spa unit . it wasn't worth $40 , sling , spa shower unit isn't useful or helpfula all	-1
i registered this tub wanting it very bad my newborn . i thought what great idea fussy babies spa not mention shower rinse . well , first time i used this it took more time set it up than i using it . also , button shower head hard press , sprayer needs remain upside down or it leak water allover your bathroom(found out hard way ) . when you use spa bubbles it makes water cold very quick . my daughter love spa effect , but i think she prefers warm water throughout her bath . one thing really annoyed me baby sling moldy smell it . i washed dried it many times cannot get this smell out . needless say i purchase insert tub , which doesn't fit very well , so im bit irritated . overall this good idea , it needs some kinks worked out it .... just not worth $40 . so now im off target purchase new tub : -	1
i would recommend seat clamps side tub over this if your baby moves all ! this seemed like good idea , but my little guy kicking moving all over . it barely floats sucks up water so it extremely heavy lift up hang dry when you bath . it also says it 0 months up , but i definitely wouldn't use this if your baby can't sit	-1

we bought bumbo seat our five month old baby . her fifth month she fell her face it still attached her bottom . she hurt pretty bad . no way this seat keep baby place its own weight . please beware how unsafe this product . not all what advertised .	-1
monitor ok , but sometimes staticky other times just needs new " channel " problem button changes channel baby room not parent unit !!! also , we like second child unit elsewhere our house if both same time it seems cause additional static , broken signal ( only reset changing channel ) no signal . overall , i am very disappointed - it got tremendous reviews i expected better product than first years model i previouly ... i am goig back my old one	1
i bought this my daughter i too one light worked , my husband take light apart play wires somehow got lights work . i am not crazy bar where blocks go because it keeps falling off hood front bus . my daughter barely plays it music only plays when we turn bus . needless say i am very disappointed this toy	1
i bought this toy my 6-month old son grow into over next year because it seemed offer variety ways learn play . when putting it together christmas morning pieces not snap together securely kept falling off . also , one light not work . poor construction this toy disappointing coming fischer-price . i returning ( not exchanging ) this toy . luckily my son young enough he not miss it	-1
this such ridiculous excuse toilet seat lid . it easy enough install but hello ! what stop anybody , especially toddler lifting entire seat lid together ? not thing ! " kit " comes it secure it toilet rim joke it rattles around like crazy when it closed , it doesn't fit snuggly around seat so it completely loose . total complete piece junk !!	-1
we started out really liking this seat . its colors not horrid like most others , it doesn't cry " i baby !! " . it just looks nice stylish . also , our baby seemed very comfortable this seat . however , #1 problem this seat its straps/belts . first , you clip them together baby midsection ( easy ) . then you need try get these 2 pieces fit together bottom , so you clip them ( one ) into female end lap belt clip . this easier said than , these 2 pieces very difficult hold together you clip them ( one ) into other part belt clip . it hard explain properly , but really , it not easy , especially if you only one hand free . second , belts get twisted . 2 pieces base belt , which need held together so they clip into female end belt clip , they get reversed because belt twists . think taking your seat belt your car , somehow twisting belt itself , so seat belt clip now faces wrong way . if this ever happened you , you know what i mean , it pain fix . just like this seat . it seems get screwed up effortlessly , but then fix it takes several minutes . forget this thing !! we bit bullet exchanged it peg perego , after we used friend when we went visit them long weekend , realized not all infant seats sucked like ours . final problem we noticed this seat our 14-pound son basically already too big it ... yet peg perego plenty growing room . yes , it cost us $100 more , but it well worth it ease use fact our son fit it until it time standard ( non-infant ) car seat	1
i bought this my three yr old it not work all . we britax roundabout carseat there not enough room pillow . i returned it	-1
i so excited this product because it sold out everywhere i looked , so i figured it must awesome . not so . it loud , which freaked out my 8 month old , not suck stuff out his nose very well . i've tried every aspirator market , nothing works better than one they use hospital . i took one home me , urge you same :) very disappointed	1
i bought this chair used i don't think it worth $50 i paid it . i also fisher price chair ( i twins ) one so much better - i wish i 2 those . first , like everyone said , it ridiculous clean . those people who said it easy clean must either not really cleaning it or babies make very little mess . gross food particles collect every crease corner , especially under seat . most importantly , tray way too high - even 1 yrs old my girls uncomfortable reaching food it they average height/weight . tray also doesn't come close enough so there big gap baby chair - not dangerous but perfect all food fall through collect sides chair lap . finally , tray too big average size dishwasher so must always washed hand . fp high chair tray go right into dishwasher . only buy this chair if only thing you care how it looks	-1
i received this highchair hand-me-down . looks lovely , mine pale blue lime green , but infuriating clean . i never seen more cracks , crevices , screw holes , all where baby food slobber collect . after one feeding my hyper 7 month-old chair beyond filthy . you need buy toothpicks get all crevices . friend mine fisher-price high chair which much less complicated easier clean . price insane ( glad mine free ) . i would never buy this chair even gift . i would advise anyone considering this chair go something cheaper easier clean . i would give it zero stars if i could	-1
we love this monitor , but only when it not awful interference . unfortunately , evening some reason interference really bad all we hear static off hours . we not live apartment or townhouse ( which i read not recommended this product ) , but we wireless internet . only we aren't using it when there static , so who knows ... i love able see my boy , but static makes monitor really annoying	-1
we couldn't wait until our daughter ready walker . unfortunately , after countless times putting new batteries , we realized toy didn't work . i immediately contacted kolcraft they sending me toy . i also wished i gotten one mirror , instead i one spinning toy my daughter keeps hitting her forehead it . add , she only stays it 15-20 minutes . other than , i really like walker ! lol :} i think it better once we get new toy	1
besides fact straps wheren't long enough hold my son crib , it ended up floor every other day !!! save your money don't buy it !!!	-1

you really get what you pay . i got this around $53 but i not like this product all ! bumper very scratchy cheaply made . comforter pretty cheap too . only thing i saved sheet crib skirt which really only sit drawer backup	-1
we 49mhz whisper connect love it ( see our review one ) . we needed second monitor replace 900mhz fisher price monitor 4+ years old , decided try this one out . we set base across room our daughter her talk her normal voice , we could barely hear here volume turned up . we thought we must defective unit , so we returned it got , we same problem . there no interference or static monitor - but also no sound . we're very unhappy it would not recommend it	-1
i so excited buy this stroller . it seemed perfect my 1 yr old daughter . mesh back would ideal hot , humid weather . it light easy travel . it seemed sturdy . most this true until i used it month . honestly , seat way too big ! my daughter forever uncomfortable b/c straps too loose even their tightest hold her seat too deep . minimal padding ( no recline ) she would bump her head side frame when riding around . top it off , frame bent after basic use . all we take it out car ! i very disappointed . maybe this would great stroller 4 year old , but don't buy this stroller b/c you're looking something smaller than your graco(but better than umbrella stroller ) your young toddler . i think price minimal features it should better quality . every review mentioned carrying strap b/c that only extra feature ! this stroller not us !	1
this okay product many , many parts clean . spout , ring top cup , handles , plastic " leak stopper " , oh , cup ! all parts fly around dishwahser . i've lost many stoppers so i've order through avent . good thing they don't leak .	1
avent makes best washable baby bottles around , so we felt their sippy cups would just good . well we wrong . five cups we , all them leaked since thrown out . cups five different pieces vs other brands use three pieces , which makes them harder wash , harder put together , more pieces lose . far sippy cups go , these among most expensive you buy worst we used out five different brands . we great luck greber playtex . please avoid	-1

i spent lot time researching strollers , after reading all reviews aria i decided register one . out box it fairly easy assemble lightweight , but i not pleased it since . shoulder straps 5 point harness cheap fall out back seat . snack cup never stayed place . steering this stroller impossible ... we took it disney last month i almost left it florida . all all i expected lot more peg perego	1
my 15-month-old son pulled these off ( broke one ) within 5 minutes installing them . also , he able turn covers which ended up turning gas . bad design . don't waste your money	-1
high walls snuggle nest made it impossible try breast feed over , pulling baby down open area suggested , defeats purpose walls first place . i would fall asleep breastfeeding wake up later only realize my daughter unprotected .	1
one reviewer , though she raves it , admits its flaw : it cant put back into its carrying form . indeed , it floppy , illconceived mess . it basically works but there much better option out there : buggybag . this " floppy " not easy one hand install , it doesnt totally protect child ) one belt feeds through hold baby cart allowing unnecessary contact ( not all covers one reviewer proposes ) b)because it doesnt install one clean drop doesnt fold into carrying shape neatly you baby contact both floppy sides this floppy mess you try flop it out cart your car . after trying floppy mess miserable seat called shop'n'dine , i've found buggybag perfect solution : truly neat one hand install ; easy zip back into its carrying shape ; 2 belts ( one baby , one cart ) neat simply storage options . ( read my amapedia article ) dont take my word it , go big baby store try out both . just standing there you'll see there no comparison . i'm ... shocked there people who liked floppy , but sure they never tried buggybag .	-1
i got this gift registered it i pregnant my daughter . this biggest mistake . canopy not cover my daughter when she sits it . make it recline , chore . my husband hardest time unfold fold it up , not make fun him . he only noce thing cup holder comes out make it easy take her out . but even still it not good purchase not buy . we however buy peg-pergo piko full size stroller even though it littl but more money . well , worth it . i would suggest we also macleran light weight stroller also very good .	1
after reading reviews this sounded like easy choice . i very wrong . when i first plugged it i could not believe how quickly wipes heated . i thought it great . i think they way too hot after they while ... but quick shake after i pulled one out cooled it down enough make it safe . then few days later i pulling them out inner lid popped open ... kept popping open every change . then when i lifed unit put new wipes ... my $700 changing table / dresser flooded warped ! ( i it replaced !! ) i not known it because pad basket table , too . same problems kept happening . so i called combi ... customer service told me instruction manual states wipes left packaging . she said excess moisture which caused flooding would held packaging . course i could not measure amount fluid ... but i am not exaggerating when i say cups ! even if it hold cups water .. so when plastic pacaking empty no longer wipes , it filled excess cups moisture then you remove dispose it ???? although it stated ... ) there should warning never use wipes not package ) why ! i bought large " bag " huggies wipes .. there no package pop . second ... she told me unit not supposed stay plugged all time .. this too , manual . so i lookeed , too . not " usage " part .. but back under " cautions " it states this : " unplug power cord when not use " . okay .... when you newborn .. when you not using your wipes .. lol ! she said it should plugged unplugged several times day keep them warm !!! i guess new mom supposed schedule ! ... if acceptable property product .. shouldn't there switch ?? i would move dresser every time .. or get extention cord , course ! crazy ! combi gave me , what i consider , ridiculous answers . they also need get real when they write manual . record .. i written review one other time rave my little bissell . this frustrated me so much i share info .!!!!!! also .. this baby #4 so i am quite familiar baby products .	-1
ideas bottles interchanging great . but unfortunately nipples cause too much gas . when they're using bottle , you hear constant air sucking around their lips . every time my little girl uses them , it seems though she just can't get comfortable them . i would recommend dr. brown or playtex ventaire bottles over any these . ultimately , convenience features aren't worth massive amount gas avent bottles cause	1

i bought this item because faq breathable baby website said bumper would fit any style crib , including ones solid headboards . however , once i received bumper , i realized it clearly not work cribs solid headboard . upon writing customer service breathable baby advice how it would fit , i told following : " breathable bumper wrap if your crib space either side corner posts . if it , wrap around outside posts . if breathable bumper won't fit your crib you should try cribshield which four separate pieces so you eliminate foot head board pieces just use long rail sides . look online see crib must straight railings not too thick so padded rail cover fit attach over it . " when i responded this information basically too little too late , it disagreed what they said their faq , i then told : " other option moms doing buying 2 breathable bumpers using short pieces front back rails . this way they padding . future , we selling them package way , but now you still safety comfort you desire . " i think it really poor customer service mislead customer into buying item then tell them order make it work , they need purchase different item or more same . customer service breathable baby since removed misleading faq , however , i now am inconvenience returning item . i am truly disappointed wish they could more upfront their website abilities product .	-1

i could go into long explanation how i searched tons research before buying occasional use pump myself , who stay home mom . i could explain detail everything i try get this pump work , meantime before figuring out motor not working , how i freaking out my supply dwindling so i went out buy fenugreek ..... but , suffice it say , motor lasted me 3 months once , twice week useage . it didn't completely die , which why it took me while figure it out , but after paying attention , i could see vaccum losing more more power until when i couldn't even get quarter ounce one side i nearly engorged ..!!! least medela shipping me out new motor , this one i hope least last longer . especially since my warranty runs out 2 months ( 6 month total warranty- which me too little product costs over $100 !! ) even though i'm staying home only use pump occasionally , i wish i'd just spent extra $150 gotten pump style !	-1

i've co-bedding my 5 month old son since he us , but we recently decided move co-sleeper give my husband i bit more space . i friends who used it read all amazing reviews so it no brainer . we've run into few problems : first we modern platform bed low ground even it lowest co-sleeper several inches high so we've switch bed frames now . second co-sleeper mattress rock hard actually sits down 4 inches divider- since i'm used him my arms night nursing i didn't want reach pick him up . we solved both these issues purchasing 2 portable crib mattresses . now he softer surface snooze i simply slide him over nurse or roll myself right up him ... we'll remove one mattresses once he bit bigger so he doesn't fall out , but now it works ! hope this helps ! *** i'm adding this few months after use- i like idea extra space offered co-sleeper attached bed , but our son now 9 months old actually slept it only handful times ... still prefer him bed us !	1
i ordered this potty chair after seeing others all some negative aspects . this seat perfect ! my almost 2.5 year old daughter took it immediately . it not too small ( she very tall ) but not too big ( she petite bottom ) . it cleans up easily , not so lightweight or small it becomes toy her . seat part itself comes off use regular toilet , handles child steady him/herself . bowl insert large removes easily cleaning . there also handles base overlap handles seat so you easily pick it up move it . lid closes " just like mommy potty " becomes wide flat step stool . perfect product	1
i ordered this changing pad because it ends curved up , not just sides . this also sometimes refered " 4-sided changing pad " since all 4 edges raised . it seems very sturdy fits very well top my dresser , effectively converting dresser changing table . only reason i didn't rate this higher it didn't include non-skid pad bottom pad . also , it would nice if it included sheet or cover . next , i need order some covers it , since baby doesn't like directly against smooth plastic surface . i am not sure which covers order	1

i recently purchased zooper tango sidy side double stroller . i some looking stores extensive research online . suddenly , i found this amazon all places . reviews great price right . i bought it , little hesitant i hadn't gotten test drive it . this stroller great ! it fits through doorways , it little tight aisle , but we're talking double stroller here , it going little wide ! i 2 year old 1 year old , so i find it veers side my 2 year old sits , just slightly . it heavier than peg perego aria , but it feels much more solid . folds easily somewhat compactly ( again , it double stroller ! ) . it fits into back my honda odyssey room bags whatnot . i would recommend this stroller anyone twins or 2 little ones . my 2 year old likes " nap " ( recline seat ) while we walking . back zips off , she likes look out back . 5 point harness keeps everyone safe , but i find i usually just use it waist seat belt . storage limited , my husband wants customize basket area - it sounded like his plans involved hack saw ... there spot bottle water or misc items ( hanging net type basket - just big enough bottle water ) zip pocket back stroller . however , if you unzip back remove it , you lost this pocket . i read mcclaren stroller organizer [ ... ] - we planning buying this carry more stuff . overall , i love our new stroller would highly recommend it !	1
my wife bought this one when my daughter 2 months old . we feed our daughter bottles ( mix formula breast milk ) , since each time we need take bottled breast milk ref ( my wife breast bumping ) , mix formula , we use this warmer all time . also , when we travel out , this one quite useful . generally only little small amount water , bottle warm enough feed my baby . also it quite compact put diaper bag ( well , not compact bag though )	1
we've used this since my daughter 7 1/2 months old ; she now 2 1/2 we've never any problems it . this best stroller quick trips mall , park , etc . sunshade great built carrying strap good idea too . we've never used rain cover , so i can't comment . it doesn't storage basket , but i don't know many umbrella strollers . longer trips , we just take our full size combi stroller if we need storage or full recline option . i would definitely recommend this stroller light " quick outing " stroller keep car .	1
my son now ' graduated ' regular tub but we used this tub year . it perfect when they too big ' seats ' your tub doesn't accomdate rings . fact this much better than ring babies sit because there pleanty cusion them when they tumble over or slip trying stand . ours withstood year use so far we'll using it next baby too	1
this best bed rail if you not box spring . my 2 year old recently moved into his toddler bed i purchased this rail because he " bunkie " board instead box spring . length satisfactory , fold-down mechanism perfect because raised hinges . it easy make bed well . we also purchased it grandparent house because they platform bed . it works equally well . my only complaint maybe rail isn't high enough but my son hasn't tempted climb over it . i would recommend this bed rail good transition " big boy " bed doesn't box spring ( although manufacturer recommends it )	1
ok so i purchased this when my son 4 months old . i always thought it pretty neat , but figured he wouldn't sleep it , because it seems glide too slow . my son wouldn't sleep anything , but his swing . i wanted get him something bigger may slightly imitate swing i know he'll sleep . so based reviews i got this product . first i little disappointed , because night soon i laid him it he would start too fuss like he everything else , except his swing . i just figured maybe i should bought it couple months ago . but , what i put one his big blankets it laid him top it whadduya know ? he sleeps it more than his swing now ! i guess it wasn't cushiony he wanted it . i kind noticed too , when i got it it appeared not cushiony . disappointing thing music volume little loud even lowest setting , so i don't even use it . aside it great . motor noise doesn't seem bother me or my son . it isn't very loud me . but anyway he sleeps it , which allows me get more me time sleep time night . i would say my money well spent	1

i bought this after fidning my 2nd child who 4 months old caught under headboard bumper came his bedding . this my 2nd child i never told this danger . i highly recommend this bumper . it comes 2 pieces , shorter one goes across front railing you move up down , longer piece goes last slat headboard last slat footboard . there only 2 gaps which where handles railing . i also able weave few places sides make sure he couldnt get underneath . i love it wide so it reaches down mattress , it velcros each end across both top bottom tight fit , it collapse if older baby tries step it but still very tight it very breathable but still little cushion it . i just wish i known danger traditional crib bumpers . thankfully i heard my son screaming when i . highly recomend this product , or one like it avoid suffocation hazard stuffed bumpers	1

very frequent ( often long-distance ) travelers , we routinely purchase airline tickets our daughter so she travel safely comfortably her car seat plane trips . we really pushed size limits car seat integrated into stroller ( graco travel system ) ease use , but once she finally made dreaded transition into larger seat , we tried practically every method moving seat , toddler , diaper bag , collapsible stroller , carry-on , etc ., our home through airport without ending up completely exhausted frustrated . all options we tried , pac back most consistently comfortable convenient . i'm not very tall ( 5'5 " ) , find i manage wear pac back , stow loose light objects ( such coats or stuffed animals ) car seat itself , sling diaper bag over one shoulder purse other , still enough mobility/agility bend down pick my daughter up or hold her hand . ( granted , i look like pac animal , but that small price pay free hands key moments . ) strap system intuitive use seems well-constructed . compared car seat bag , pac back much more easily removed car seat once plane , i never any trouble replacing straps minute or two -- plenty time seat my back time people start exiting plane . straps adjust easily enough my taller husband i take turns carrying seat when we travel together without spending lot time situating ourselves . only drawbacks : you really pay attention while wearing what amounts giant rigid backpack you don't bash someone or something while turning , straps may removed go through security if x-ray machine extremely small opening ( only happened once or twice regional airports ) . overall , amazingly simple but incredibly helpful product .	1
we love swaddle me blankets . we flannel fleece . this helped us getting our daughter sleep through night ( just two weeks using them ) . she loves swaddled but very strong would wiggle out then wake up need swaddled again . velcro she less able get out swaddle feels safe secure sleeps longer . fleece little more stretch it easier use but flannel little lighter weight summer so not overheat . not tried cotton ones . definitely worth try	1

gate works perfectly . however , it doesn't get 5 stars because installation instructions not very intuitive . i am very handy tools , remodeling , etc . i found installation take longer than i would expected . latch receptacles different sizes smaller one goes top . there " u " stamped it , but no mention instructions . nor instructions mention size difference bigger one goes bottom . how hard would ? one sentence ? i went through dry run figured it all out , but it doubled installation time ( took +/- 1 hour )	1

this gate easy install simple operate once you get hang how it works . my son one half years old tendency rush gates ( he broken two already ... ) so far , this one holding up . i would not recommend anyone use it top stairs because it doesn't installation kit , but hallways bottom stairs it works really well . it swings closed its own pretty loud if you let it slam shut ... we use ours kitchen so it doesn't wake babies up- however , if you use it hallway near where your kids sleeping , it might loud enough disturb their sleep . all all , it really good deal i would highly recommend this product	1

i looking double stroller i could get out my sedan easily . i didn't like tandems because they not only take up tons space , but they also very heavy . this stroller light , i take it out my trunk one hand . plus , because my kids heavy enough push , i am not pushing extra 25+ pounds stroller . because it side-by-side , it tight fit going through some doors , but i never unable get through door . my husband thinks some parts cheap look like they break easily , but 6 months lots use , we no problems . sun visors bent angle when storing , but i still use them fine i like they rotate down , so you angle them sun . i am so glad i bought this rather than larger , more expensive , heavier tandem stroller	1
it very safe because non-slip rubber . our son uses it when he brushes his teeth or when he goes potty . nice color too . highly recommended !!	1

i didnt know these things exsisted my first child , now i found them i use it constantly ! this floppy seat much better then others you get little cheaper , but long run this best your money ! i washed it least half dozen times , its washes great ! i also am so glad one seat works cart well highchair . other products i saw you buy one each item . it almost double cost . it take few minutes get it hooked up , but its worth it quiet germ free shopping experience , my son so ccomfy it ! i lots people ask me where we got it . i love added extras cup holder pocket some places hook up some toys . it very plush made great fabric , it not cheap anyway . this one item i dont intend live without , i also think this great shower gift anyone expecting ! i cant say enough this product	1
i am very happy this potty . it high guard which works well little boy .	1
this graco family tree play yard perfect newborns . setup isn't quite easy description implies , simply because instructions all pictures , without corresponding written directions . said , little patience first time around makes setting up putting away play yard incredibly easy afterward . quilted mattress pad serves double duty wrap around folded up play yard when you need take it go . i find this especially convenient because it guarantees i won't leave essential piece home when i take yard me . description bit error regards mobile music . attachment sits side yard incredible variety settings vibration , music/noise , lighting . there different timed settings you use help get baby sleep . music not , however , directly attached mobile . also , mobile sits its own ; it not turn . bothered me first , but i quickly got over it when i realized my newborn didn't seem care anyway . changing table sits higher than those other play yards i've seen , making diaper changes much easier back . built diaper holder baby wipes holder convenient those rush changes . changing table padded easy clean up , though you need use lap pads or something sort , there isn't removable pad it . this actually my preference , it less stuff my baby contend , but may bothersome parents who think their baby needs extra cushioning . when taking this go , i said , it easy pack up . one minor drawback travel bag holds play yard . it doesn't handle , it doesn't fit all components yard . changing table mobile sit home when i take this go . reality , if i'm travelling , it more convenient not these extra pieces worry . however , i'm not sure how i'll pack them up when my baby outgrows changing table just using yard itself . i consider very minor consideration though . this play yard sits my living room where it incredibly convenient because it space hold all my baby essentials so i'm not constantly run nursery . i'm not sure what parent organizers intended ( they look like little soft-sided cup holders ) , but i've found them convenient places store extra burp cloths , pacifier , socks just too little stay together anywhere else .	1
my daughter started baby bjorn stand alone potty seat - which great when she just getting started idea using potty . she quickly became too tall use stand alone potty seat , so i ordered this baby bjorn toilet trainer it fantastic . she quickly learned how put seat toilet herself adjust wheel make it snug . it also easy her remove hang small butterfly doorknob my husband attached side sink cabinet . seat gave her great sense independence allowed her comfortable secure while learning use big potty . it also great traveling . i would put it zippered canvas tote carry it us into rest areas ( it really fit any toilet ) - she could sit securely protected unclean surfaces ( i would carry small container disinfectant wipes clean her seat off each time we used it public restroom ) . i highly recommend this baby bjorn toilet trainer	1

i really love these bumper pads also quality after washing very good . only thing i donacute ; like way strings work . there not enough also they rip off easily . not stitched well price . generally bumper pads not recommended babies before age 12 months since air gets blocked away bed , also suffication could problem . we bought convertable crib ( common europe ) which used till approx . age 5 so we attach bumper bed later . anyhow we still love it . it looks matches perfectly rest safari .	1

i loved this ! he always right next me but safe separate space . it folds up smaller than pack play , takes up very little room next bed , netted tent cover summer protect mosquitos ( or your cat who dying sleep baby	1
when my daughter born , i didn't know swaddling , it would take me hours get her sleep ! i would feed or rock her my arms until she falls asleep , then put her her crib ... she'd flail her arms , wake up cry , i start all over ! what nightmare ! then i figured out since her arms wake her , it would make sense wrap her something so she couldn't move them much ... so i started wrapping her regular receiving blankets . it worked ! it became much easier get her sleep . but then she wiggled out those receiving blankets wake up again . when she little over month old , somehow i came across swaddleme blankets internet immediately bought it . it worked like charm ! it so easy wrap my daughter it , it stayed put . my daughter started sleeping so much better ! i wish i found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me so many sleepless nights ! 2 years later , my son born , thankfully i already knew those blankets start . he goes sleep great swaddleme blanket ! out curiosity , i tried put him sleep without this blanket , his arms wake him right away - exactly same my daughter ! i consider this blanket one most important baby items you could buy . it should must new mother who wants get some sleep	1
i thought i would quit breastfeeding because my nipples soo sore ! i saw my skin practically peel off my nipple when i started breastfeed . i placed gelpads , within two hours , i could see healing begin . i tried olive oil nipple cream , didn't even want try anything lanolin because i read it wasn't good ingest , it not help all . this great way sooth nipples naturally . just let your breast air dry little breast milk ( natural oils ) , then place pads nipples . they life savers . i think i only needed three pairs , until my nipples used rigors breast feeding ( 2-3 weeks ) . don't give up ! try these first , these work	1
this cup holder works great . i attached it pull cart i needed work put books , etc . after i foot surgery . it also works walkers	1
i really love this system find it met all my needs . my son receives only breastmilk this system made it so easy express , store , feed him bottle . i not found liner cost problem . nor i disturbed how many kits i needed buy . i think i bought 5 or 6 make sure i enough . it just depends how much you're going need store . but you don't need many actual bottles , since milk doesn't stored them , so price evened out me . besides , it much cheaper than buying formula ! i also don't care exact measurements how much my son eats . i get measurement just lifting liner out taking look . but when he breast , i don't know how much he eaten , so i don't track just how much he bottle , either . i just make sure he enough dirty diapers . i find system easy use because i express directly into liner , put bottle into freezer , then remove liner bottle when it frozen . this reduces space needed . when it feeding time , just pop one them into bottle , heat , replace cap nipple . easy !	1

my twins loved this one so much ... we purchased all styles available time	1
baby size : my daughter started out just over 5 lbs , this seat fit her well beginning . straps adjusted easily she rapidly grown , i haven't adjustment problems other reviewers . head support worked well too ( first we use rolled towel inside it her tiny head ) . baby head not fall forward long seat properly leveled according convenient indicator side seat , but if angle even slightly off this happen easily . seat only leveled center seat some sedan backseats ( like my toyota camry ) because this angle requirement , but there leveling accessories you buy help this issue . portability : i love stay-in-car base , which i found easy install properly . it also very easy snap carrier portion out , very obvious whether carrier secure or not . extra base great families multiple cars , either parent quickly snap seat go . carrier portion convenient quick trips out car , but i find it much too heavy comfortably carry long distances baby over 10 lbs ( i'm fairly strong ) . it not fit securely enough my taste child seat portion grocery cart , but it fit well when placed sideways across larger basket portion ; i just stash groceries large space left underneath carrier rest basket . snap ' go stroller great if you're taking this seat farther your car . it much more lightweight than large " travel system " graco also sells this seat . it easy maneuver comfortable most people push , but little too short if you're much taller than 6 ft . durability : i can't comment seat lifespan , we've only using it little over 2 months . few times i noticed sticking carrier handle other reviewers mentioned , but it doesn't happen often . canopy seems rather flimsy me , but we only use it occasionally when using stroller , so it hasn't issue so far . other considerations : windsor seems fairly gender-neutral pattern , if this matters you . my baby wears lot yellow clothes , people seem assume she boy 60% time when she this seat . carrier handle several different positions : up carrying , flat carseat use , down resting carrier portion flat surface without letting it wobble . handle left up , " wobble-enabled " carrier portion rocked slightly floor stall fussy baby you try finish errand before she erupts . i would buy this seat again . its only drawbacks its weight ( probably unavoidable since it carseat must sturdy ) rather stringent placement requirement leveling ( but least indicator lets you know this problem )	1
we got this monitor because other reviews we read it . we graco our daughter it picks up so much static other back round noice . you hardly hear her it . baby quiet sounds works great far able hear baby clearly . receiver eats up batteries fast some fed back only batterie use . our graco too so i don't know if norm monitors . sound best when pluged . nightlight great . humidity function i not figured out yet . it say it 19% every room i don't know correct . temp works fine . i not played enough it yet set controls how it works . i like time receiver it lights up see it night time . i haven't used timer yet but could see how it could helpful . over all - like my choice monitor .	1

we bought two these take family trip . we chose these both price , higher weight tolerance ( 45 lb ) . our 40 pound six-year old swap places sibling when he gets tired during long day zoo . they recline far enough infant , also . but , our 10 month old preferred sit forward hold onto front bar take sights . strollers compact light . underneath storage mesh hold purse small diaper bag . there pocket back hold water bottle , well latch hold small items handles . stroller also easy maneuver . we very pleased our purchase ! stoller even hold combi carseat , but it didn't work our graco	1

i actually surprised how good sound quality this icrib sound system . it very nice features like 15min or 30min shutdown timer , so you put baby bed music then icrib shut down after specified time . nightlight also really neat , it cycles four different colors . only problem this product it cannot run ac , only batteries , so we'll buying lots batteries over next couple years , but otherwise this great product . edit -- after further consideration i would drop rating 3 stars two reasons . first , i found lack ac power source very inconvenient . second , batteries wear down , sound quality speakers deteriorates significantly	1

just received this set my wife i love it ! construction very solid but not too bulky us . micro-fabric seems high quality goes nicely our furniture . only two complains : 1 ) handle height not adjustable , which seems bit too high us ( i am 5'6 " btw ); 2 ) it would great hand-break ( i.e. wheel lock button handle ) -- we previously thought red button handle wheel lock but it not ; it collapse/expand button instead . despite these imperfection , we feel it much worth $195 we paid	1

i tried these first time my fourth child . i wish i would used this system all my children . i used all kinds bottles old glass bottles vent-air avent ... many types my first 3 children . i decided give these try considering i tired scrubbing bottles . my little girl switched these very easily breast , it helped tremendously her colic cutting down gas ( switching regular formula soy helped , plus i start avoiding all milk products while breastfeeding)plus they so easy clean manage . i no leak problems like i avent ... vent-air #1 nipple would collapse plus my son would projectile spit-up after feedings when i tried switch him #2 nipples ( awful system ) ... absolutely no problems original playtex bottles . my only minor complaint trying fit my fingers bottle collapse liner rid air ... very hard if you not tiny hands . we bought easy-feed bottles lift bottom aid releasing air ... alittle easier . store brand liners work just well brand name liners ... i seen no difference except price . target brand very good . i would recommend these bottles everyone	1
i got this system my 18 mo . old who playing game sticking his leg through slats his crib then claiming he " stuck " . they helped prevent him doing any more . however , if he mood , he easily dismantle entire contraption - so it won't work keep older child tearing it apart if they want . fact , two end panels removed because he wouldn't leave them alone . all all though , i think mesh " bumpers " what they claim they work well keeping toys ( pluggers ) crib instead out floor	1
we used small size until our daughter too long it ( around 3 months old ) switched large size . she still loves it sleeping great ( 3 day naps 10-11 hours uninterrupted sleep night) ! it part her naptime/bedtime routine it travels us so she get good sleep familiar environment wherever we . velcro lifesaver microfleece helps her stay warm but not overheated .	1
i used medela pump style advance 4 months now after my first baby . this pump best its class it best thing i bought 2006 . why i gave this item 5-star ratings : -1 ) it helped me establish steady milkflow 2nd week breastfeeding . i am working mom only 8 weeks off delivery till i get back work again . so it important me rely good breast-pump keep supply going . 2 ) this pump comfortable use i regulate speed which suitable me . medela parts easy set up usage also easy wash sterilise . 3 ) it never breakdown ever ! 4 months now , i'm pumping 4 - 5 times day . i bring this unit office also whenever i am travelling . it very mobile , although little heavy carry . 4 ) it battery pack which handy whenever i am place without power-supply . 5 ) i bought this online amazon usd$ 319 . but malaysia , this unit would cost myr1800 ( usd$ 500 ) . just note non-us users ( like myself ) , you need get adapter which compatible this pump . this easily obtained any electrical shops . this good buy , if you're looking pump , then you found it !	1

we really like our graco digital imonitor . it gives very clear sound good range volumes , much longer range than any analog monitors we tried previously . we not get quite range claimed box -- usually it reaches 1/2 city block , depending strength charge left rechargeable batteries . lights light up baby sound quite bright , which problem if you like sleep complete darkness . i turn monitor around so lights not keep me awake	1

this stuff works wonders my son sensitive bum ... fast ! we usually see results just one application - usually next changing irritaion gone or nearly so . it also very natural/herbal scent which further outweighs other barrier creams . it may seem little pricey per ounce comparison , but i've found i don't need use much , which makes argument mute	1

i purchased baby einstein discover play center keep office days my then-5-mnth-old son , toby , me work . he immediately loved musical buttons sun , ignored everything else . he grew , he discovered other toys one one . it exciting watch him perfecting different skills necessary manipulate activities . because i used baby einstein secure place meals , it needed regular cleaning . seat pops right off easy cleaning , but cloth saddle little hard unsnap base . overall , assembly pretty easy - i put it together myself i am not mechanically inclined . i definitely recommend baby einstein activity center . i looked several other brands turned off all obnoxious toys activities . i wanted something toby could learn , not just dazzled bells whistles . i can't say toby learned any spanish language buttons , but baby einstein kept my son engaged even 11 months , when his willingness stay one place usually short-lived .	1

my husband i loved look shapes moblie . my baby face just lights up when he placed his bed naps or night time . however we find ourself running back forth so much because cute little songs stopped before he falls asleep . i looking online saw some these new mobiles remotes them . it would seem all new things come out manufactors would given public option wind up mobile or remote mobile . i hope someone these places reads these takes time put more thought into what parents would want future purchases . but like i said before we love look love they way my son reacts it . so i'll look this mobile weight loss bonus all running back forth	1
my son born february i actually considered taking this product back because i didn't think it would usueful . after using this product few times i decided i wrong . i {{ love }} this product . it fit perfectly my infant carrier . dressing my newborn son not process he enjoyed let alone put into carrier . bundle me i didn't struggle putting my baby any coats or buntings then struggle bulkiness get him into carrier order take him out into cold . additional bonus i found if i needed take him indoors but keep him carrier i didn't need worry him overheating . i just unzip top blanket pull it back . it like little sleeping bag . unfortunately , i think my son too big his current carrier when winter befalls us again . i think we moving carseat instead carrier point so bundle me less useful . even if i just use seat portion keep blanket top extra cold days it workout great . i already consider it well worth money	1

we originally registered this item because we 2-level house , thought this would help us trudging up down stairs so much . but , since my 2-month old still " lives " our room , her bassinet , part not yet issue . however , we keep this basket our living room , fully stocked , we don't even get up off couch change diaper . ( sounds lazy , but if you already kids , you understand ! ) sides liner pockets , which we use hold hand sanitizer , diaper rash cream , thermometer , baby brush , aspirator , baby nail clippers , lotion , couple rattles/toys , some chapstick nursing pads me . we put diapers , changing pad , wipe holder " main " center part . i also two wrist rattles attached either side handle , my baby loves look them while she getting her diaper changed .

i love this chair so my 5 month old . i love it reclines 3 different postions best feature it slides up down meet my level needs . feeding him any height easy	1
this nice chair , except brakes . they lock so easily if you just barely brush them your foot , they lock . it seems all you look them they lock . since we constantly moving chair us , or back wall , etc ., this real problem because you unlock them ( esp . if more than one four locked ) order move chair easily . baby gets heavier heavier becomes toddler , this even harder . pleats bottom seat pad probably unnecessary definately hard get crumbs out . if it weren't brakes , i would give it 5 stars . toy aquarium nice except they could make large push pads which make fish move around water , easier little ones push	1
my twins love these blocks . they received them gift 3 months old . first they enjoyed just touching them , each side blocks different texture . now they older ( 7 months ) these blocks one their favortite toys . they easily hold them , shake them throw them	1
great attractive colors baby ... but quite too big ( frustrating ) 5-6 month-old who just starting learn grasp one hand just learning navigate his opposable hands .	1
my 20 month old loved this when i bought it her still plays it daily now , 5 months later . i especially love fact it comes box so all bits pieces tidied away after play time one central place , there no danger anything gets lost . definitely must if your market pretend kitchen play	1

i got safe bather over year ago my first son am due my second son getting him . i used it sink when my son infant then moved it into tub he grew . he never cried when i bathed him seemed very comfortable . it holds warm water too . he got older he sat it i would just lay him down wash his lower half . i never any problems it or any smell issues . it machined washed tumbled dried easily . after each use i would ring out much water i could just hang it up curtain rod let it drip dry . i would recommend it anyone !	1
maclaren umbrella stroller best around . it very lightweight easy manuver . it worth price i would highly recommend this stroller every mom child over 1 year old . only drawback basket under seat only hold up 5 lbs . this stroller easy open close fits nicely trunk your car	1
this excellent lightweight stroller one we use most often . we more expensive , larger , " safer " stroller more features , but we found we never use it always use this one . collapsing stroller pop into car breeze , there adequate shoulder strap you carry stroller when you doing portage over rough ground . we take stroller everywhere . we've used it well-groomed trails hiking , museums , restaurants , we've even used it beach , we've used it paris metro . this great stroller train subway travel . wheels lock feature which allows them rotate , or swivel , rear wheels brake mechanism which little awkward release , but i find comforting rather than frustrating : i want solid brakes . there small basket back stroller baby bag , purse , few groceries , so this again excellent stroller when you just running out few things or going small picnic . if i apartment dweller city , this stroller i'd ge t.t he only bad feature : this not stroller you run ! don't even try . harness excellent , but takes time adjust it correctly so it not too snug nor too loose . this super lightweight stroller , but quality product excellent engineering design . it not like those flimsy twenty-dollar throwaways just maclaren name it : this real deal . we used it two kids , still works like new . we should get sales rep compensation , because no one really these paris all our friends saw ours got one too	1
my son using this seat since he able sit unassisted . chair very easy assemble disassemble . it also dishwasher safe , which helpful those really messy situations . removable tray great getting mess away him , so i clean him up without him getting messy again . he now almost 20 months old , we still use it ( now booster ) . he tall his age , but it still fits him well ( plenty room grow ) . complaints it not fitting larger babies , i don't really know . my son very slender , but there quite bit " breathing room " him . we make frequent trips grandma house friends ' houses this seat very travel friendly . all all , this great product great price .	1
i am very busy evening , cleaning , cooking , homework , laundry , etc . i place my daughter her activity zone wherever i am she play watch me without fussing . this toy life saver . i would lost without it	1

we chose this mattress because its firmness ( not too hard or too soft)and its vinyl cover . we went higher priced option , but not over top expensive . perfectly honest , we didn't know what else look crib mattress , i mean , how you really test one . well , our twins slept well together one until they separated into two cribs where they also slept very well . they 3 weeks shy 3 years old still sleeping mattress their toddler beds . we found they fit crib very well ( no dangerous gaps ) , held up changing normal use . mattresses both still look feel new . way , kids both average sized . we getting ready buy our third child . i definitely recommend this mattress	1
i bought this thing my new nephew i'm satisfied , his parents told me best gift they received , i recommend it , excellent product	1
after trying four other models safety gate , i am happy finally found one works me . i use this gate my dogs , but it would equally effective baby . it sturdy , easy operate , good-looking , unobtrusive gate . this gate not pressure-mounted . it needs screwed into wall both sides . however , i learned hard way pressure-mounted gates lot damage walls , they more difficult operate , they bulky . if need gate going relatively long-term , i now believe it easier screw it worry patching wall when time comes . i've also learned gates vertical bars more likely left alone because it more difficult pups get purchase them . ones grids or cross-pieces encourage dogs rattle them -- jump , habit i work hard extinguish	1
when you need babyproof your house -- especially those us who stairs--don't look any further -- this gate use . we this installed our former house top bottom stairs . very safe secure . our sons tried climb it , but couldn't--yanked it it wouldn't budge . our new house , we different type stairs no gate would work , so we installed these same gates leading stairs . our hallway wider so we just purchase extensions . perfect . it prevented our boys getting up stairs unsupervised . we just our third baby ( girl ) , so my husband installing these same gates again soon .	1
all medela products ( nursing pads , lanolin , bras , pumps , etc ... ) definitely best i've tried ( i've tried most all mainstream brands ) . this bra particular extremely comfortable sore nipples . i sensitive skin nipples i found this best there ( bravado too rough me some other night nursing bras i tried ) . material sort pantyhose type material where when you slip it , it feels though there nothing there but it protects supports your sensitive breasts ( especially important during first several weeks first time nursing ) . it not really bra you'd want wear evening out it more sports type bra it would not support adequately high impact activities ( like aerobics , etc ... ) but it perfect around house or errand running or low impact activities such yoga . larger breasted women ( especially breast feeding - i went 36dd 36g ) , this bra works perfectly me support comfort . it must anyone who breastfeeding	1
love sunshade . most part works well , except if you running rather windy conditions , then , it just flies back not cover kids so well . i really use my double jog stroller jogging am happy sunshade , kids like it too . only other frustration if you small child who rather reclined stroller sun close setting , you may not get good coverage keep sun out eyes unless you pull shade completely over stroller . . . then older child isn't too happy because he/she can''t see out !	1
these diapers hold newborn poo - better than anything . after watching lots friends wash their babies clothes everytime they pooped - because it leaked out disposable - i deciced got kissaluvs- just change diaper instead whole outfit ! we used these 2 months solid proraps bummis super whispher wrap ( my favorite ) . when given four - except - 2 months my baby started hate wetness next her skin - all - it would wake her her naps ( could use fleece liner solve problem ) they take forever dry - i'll hang them line all day then still dry them 20 mins . - overall they great	1

when my son began climbing out his crib , we cringed . we live townhouse his room 14 ' 30 ' space our walkout basement . one portion this area used our storage exercise equipment , however , so we very nervous he would pull something down himself . i realize manufacturers not advertise this use , but it possible link these gates end end order cover longer stretch . gate cleans up easily much less expensive ( even needing purchase two ) than other configuration gate options . our son 19 mos old 38 " tall ( very tall ) he not gone over gate- he leaves it alone ! he able climb over many plastic metal pressure gates . it take bit installation time ( hour both gates ) , you need basic skills install it . one other thing , my husband go out buy drill bit right size gate install- 7/32 " , so prepared . this best $200 i've spent toddler products thus far	1
this gate really adaptable attractive . i use it puppy safety containment . it works great	1

we two these rails three years now very happy them . they stood up plenty kicks shoves active sleeper . rails contracted when we need transport them . our twin mattress rails take up 2.5 inches off each side . i must admit i not know how use rails properly first thought they challenging remove . my husband , who read directions , installed them easily gave me quick demo how adjust them . once i patient enough learn how use them , it quick easy manuever them . these rails secure durable , ones last through younger siblings well .	1
we like this bed railing it serves its purpose more . this bed rail very forgiving considering my daughter always uses it bar climb onto her bed . don't understand how other reviewer said " it stuck out so far . " i agree other reviewer railing wasn't probably installed right user . if you installed it correctly , bed railing should even actually take some bed space ( 2 or 3 inches ) .	1
this great distraction little ones any age almost , but , not lose remote ! if it misplaced , falls out vehicle because little one heaved it over side like my guy everything , there no way turn it without remote ! both mirror remote use up batteries pretty quick when you let child play it turning it off . other than its wonderful sleepy time , night time distraction without letting your child play remote . night it lights up different places frame softly while playing music which isn't so loud its going keep them awake . i would buy it again or give it gift	1
i saw this item relative registry decided buy one when i getting ready our second child . i thought it would good way our three year old " admire " new baby without hold him all time . it works great that- but even better keeping our baby asleep ! he spitter , recently diagnosed reflux just three weeks . recommendation reflux babies allow them incline after feedings . this serves purpose perfectly . it keeps baby warm snuggly helps stop spitting up ! only word warning- make sure baby centered cushion if sleeping . our son managed wriggle over side bit .	1

babies/children always curious don't like sleeping much since it reduces their " nosy " and/or get-into-trouble time . our family love sleepsacks we consider them volvos , because their safety value ::( 1 ) reduces possibility sids - not necessary quilt or blankets crib your baby when he/she sleepsack . ( 2 ) soothes fussy babies - my nephews nieces always ready mr. sandman soon they their sleepsacks - probably because " cocoon " -like feeling ( so similar their time their mommy womb ) . they roll around ( once they older , course ) still sleep through night safely , so you get some sleep too without worrying potential dangers crib . get 3 ( 2 small 1 either medium or large ) you should good go . newborn size better suited preemies . choice medium or large negotiable because babies grow different rates .	1
great item good price . it works perfectly doesn't take up too much space even though it handle plenty items	1
this bed better than i hoped ! my son , age 16 months decided revolt against crib , opt mommy daddy bed instead ! we very leery putting him big boy bed so early age , this bed seemed built toughest safest . transition amazingly better than i could ever dreamed ! my son loves this bed not only started sleeping through night again , but naps it well ! it totally cute , design such even tough tosser/turner my son won't fall out - unless he wants ! even then , it low enough ground so no injury occurs . i highly recommend this bed	1

i've used this foldable seat all 3 my kids now ( two girls boy ) . it so nice store diaper bag ( storage bag it came long since ripped so i store mine gallon size ziploc bag ) it goes everywhere . i put it our swim bag when we go pool too - it so nice able put kids it not balance them huge public toilets . they're more relaxed sitting themselves too ( which means shorter wait bathroom ) . i've read reviews pinched bums read them when i first bought this too - just careful all i say . my kids never got pinched but then , i put them carefully so it doesn't happen . just pay attention pros convenience this seat far outweigh cons	1

our 6 week old daughter hard time gas we tried everything we knew ( different holds , burping , gas drops , etc . ) nothing seemed help . one night we purchased baby bliss gripe water even though i skeptical it would work , it worked within couple minutes . it only thing seems calm her down when she extremely upset . definitely worth paying money when it makes your little one feel better	1
we love camping -- so this bug net great keeping over pack play while she slept , also great covering stroller while out walks woods . it such low price , absolutely worth it	1
i ordered this bookcase our newborn room - its perfect ! it just right height lamp top - so we read while sitting our rocking chair . only thing i didn't like backing flimsy board - but bookshelf up against wall it doesn't matter much . so far all books we've gotten fit shelves also . i would recommend this low horizontal bookcase anyone	1
we love using our co-sleeper . we not comfortable our baby sleep across room crib , i initially worried baby sleep our bed . co-sleeper lets our baby sleep close enough paranoid mom like myself hear him breathing night , reach him quickly when he wakes up . i also love it easy pull him into our bed nighttime feedings	1
my twin toddlers love this potty chair so i -- easy cleaning/dumping , sturdy sitting standing . one minus -- my son likes pull cushion portion off seat(while he sitting it ) . annoying . behavior-wise , we're working it , but i think manufacturer could made it bit more difficult remove	1
i purchased this potty strickly customer ratings not disappointed . it very sturdy , enough so even my husband use it seat when sitting our daughter . all parts very easy clean . i started her training 15 months , just keeping her potty bathroom her sit it ( her clothes ) every time my husband or i went bathroom . she soon got idea sitting it without diaper . because it took so long her go , we used entire unit , but it didn't take long until we started just carrying around padded seat her use adult potty . purchasing this product worth it , even if we'd only gotten padded seat . i bought second seat manufacturer keep our other bathroom so we wouldn't go up down stairs fetch it every time she needed go , but it isn't nearly nice . primo seat isn't just piece plastic hole middle . it thin contoured shape little one bottm . it fits snugly adult potty . it rubber pads plastic pegs underside keep it slipping when she sits down . i also like either boy or girl use it , without extra parts assemble or disassemble . there small rise front boys , but it isn't so high it gets way when child sits down . very sturdy , very easy use clean . can't say enough this product .	1
this very simple use protects my daughter bed . great investment if you early stages potty training your child hasn't mastered sleeping through night or naps without accident . i highly recommend it	1
reviews right . my four week old captivated this . i put her her crib awake she goes sleep . she used cry . only problem i wish timer longer or even better noise activated . i go back turn it back few times , but i believe this one one longer timers . if you problem putting you child bed . go get it !! if it longer timer i would give it 5 stars	1
this gift my daughter she loves it . she mezmerized lights movement cry when it turns off ( she still too little reset herself ) . characters cute , waterfall very calming ( even my husband i stare it ) , music noises very nice relaxing . i think it few areas improvement . 1 ) straps really hard get . 2)the timer way too short - i am always reset it my daughter 3)it would nice if it could positioned higher . instructions say 7 " soother mattress necessary which means it go head crib instead side until my baby old enough where i reposition height mattress . so , unless she positioned sideways she really doesn't get see it well . i really like this item it lifesaver getting our little one fall asleep crib ( she 10 weeks old now using this month ) . i highly recommend it	1
my son born 3 weeks early , small side @ 6lbs 18oz . this enveloped him very well , even nurses thought it great product should required all new babies . i love material , its ease use	1

i much research i could before purchasing two these car seats my grandson ( one my car one my daughter ) . this car seat always seemed rank pretty well , price affordable , so i bought it . my first impression car seat came when i lifted box - it so light ! after weeks hauling my steadily-growing big-for-his-age grandson his infant seat , it so nice lift something didn't feel like cement brick . straps very easy adjust his comfort , bottom liner going great those oops . seat truly very easy adjust , compared others i looked . my grandson very comfortable it . it wonderful purchase us , every respect	1
first all , kudos amazon carseat my house 2 days ( super saver shipping , i might add ) . secondly , i spent days , days , looking new infan t-t oddler convertible seat . i 05 trailblazer desparately looking narrow seat i could fit 2 graco turbobooster seats . it still tight fit but it works . this narrowest seat i could find internet . baby body pad definitely must since there very little padding seat cover . it work little while , but during summer i'm sure baby not stand much cushion around her legs , it make her hot . i'll figure something else out point . seat looks better than i expected inch less wide than titan . titan definitely doesn't work two boosters . i can't see any use pillow , other than looks . i'm very happy my entire purchase	1
my daughter loves her sleepsack . she sleeping one since she stated turning over her stomach could not swaddled anymore . we put her onesie underneath , when cooler put something warmer underneath . we've got 2 so there always one clean . worth money	1

1 . you can't beat price ... excellent ! 2 . easy use . 3 . doesn't take up much space . i've even packed it my suitcase it travels well . 4 . great warming food bottles . suggestions : 1 . only use distilled water it ... works much better . 2 . cleaning : once month use mixture half distilled water white vinegar ( 2 oz . total ) pour it warmer turn it . doesn't smell great , but works fantastically !!! love , love , love it !!! p.s. i've using this product 6+ months now .	1
very satisfied this stroller . i shocked just how lightweight it really . it folds up easy only use your foot release locking mechanism below . my daughter likes sit up , but i also recline it quick snooze . easy maneuver stores seemed fairly smooth uneven surfaces . very happy after going through more than 3 umbrella strollers i returned stores due one problem or .	1
after going through many strollers , this stroller definitely gets my vote . it lightweight , compact , lots features bulky stroller . handles long so i don't hunch over anymore i my umbrella stroller . recline feature also good . it allows my son sleep comfortably rather than falling front while asleep . basket also nice . only reason i gave it 4 star because sometimes wheels tend get twisted around get stuck while rough sidewalks . other than , i really like this stroller	1
i bought this tub my 7 month old daughter , who out grew her infant tub . it very nice . it just enough room her play her toys , but still small enough safe . it blows up just like pool ( very easily ) . i also use this my mother home , where she tubless showers , it works extremely well !! i suggust buying tub grips when you get it . overall , excellent . :	1
i like avent bottles lot ... tops extra wide able put formula mix , without getting it all over counter . i don't think these bottles seem help my son gas , he just baby , they generally gassy . bottles tend leak if inside white ring not completely dry first . overall i've pretty happy them though , i've never contempated switching . ** i however recommend just skipping 4 oz bottles buying just all 9 oz bottles ... my son 3 weeks old already taking 6 oz , so anytime we use 4 oz bottles , we make additional 2 oz after he empties bottle . i wish i just registered package 9 oz instead 4 oz	1
this very easy assembly worked well my 2.5 yr old grandson . no falling bed during sleep . he , however , deliberately find his way out bed rail foot bed bedrail stores well used over next several years . we found this safe product pleased this purchase	1

we purchased new graco " hands free " diaper pail after our 4th child born hoping it would hold odor like our diaper genie , unfortunately we wasted $49 . we used diaper genie our first 3 children , after sampling others , always come back diaper genie . it best keeping odors , just make sure you change it regularly you'll love it . diaper genie ii better than " twist away " style too . i would difinitely recommend this product	1
excellent item , well priced . pretty much like safety 1st " neat " diaper disposal system , but some improvements . we got this b/c safety 1st one discontinued we no longer get refill rings ours	1
i love new improved diaper genie !! our original genie constantly need new film canister , couldn't keep up smell my two babies diapers ( 3 months 2 years old ) . genie ii , other hand , no odor since day one !! film also seems last longer , since there no wasting it " twisting " chunk film each diaper . this produuct much easier effective than original genie , i absolutely suggest it all my friends !! finally !! diaper pail actually works !	1
well main reason i bought this swing because it plugged into wall instead consuming massive amounts batteries . however my son doesn't really like swing it yet he just likes sit there not move . but overall it good swing . only reason i gave it four stars because when it motion it only seems move one speed regardless what speed it set . great product though	1
we picked out this chair our daughter . we love it ! i put her it while i'm working kitchen she sits it while we eat dinner . she loves toy !!	1
we love this tub . we never bothered hammock so i can't comment it . we still use it she almost 2 years old ! we used reclining side when she baby used toddler side after she could sit up her . it so handy able stand up straight kitchen sink bathe her . before i bought tub , i thought getting primo tub because it such great reviews . however , when i saw it store , it looked gigantic . i took chance less expensive first years tub i can't imagine anything better .	1
this set waterproof pads very versitle . i found it difficult find bassinette crib pads this set both plus other pads , great value	1
this great quality sheet . it thicker than standard pack play sheets . it adds little more padding our munchkin . we purchased it navy washed it several times . color hasn't faded it just gets softer every wash . i highly recommend this product !	1
i purchased this toybox 2 nights ago toysrus . it pretty spacious sturdy . i really not like lid though . it not stay up very well . it just kind sits top toy box these 2 slots . it doesn't actually snap into place so my five little boys constantly take it off . drawers bottom just slide into open space under toybox , they not actually attatched anything either but they nice put smaller toys so they don't get lost bottom toybox .	1
i using mei hip since my son 7 months old ( 5 months ) . i love ella roo products . i also mei tai . key comfort spread strap across shoulder so weight distributed . it makes running errands work around house so much easier . it positions your baby hip so you more range motion than if he your belly/chest other carriers . i fully recommend mei hip . though i would wait until your baby hold his head up well there no head support so it not new babies .	1
our toddler this tub when he turned 7 months old , until year half old ( when our cat punctured it ! ) . it so fantastic we bought it again our next baby . this tub perfect size , comfortable safe because it inflated , travels nicely , our kids love it . our 2 1/2 year old still wants use his sister tub few nights week !	1

i bought this carrier b/c i saw my midwives carrying their babies it maternity center - they highly recommended it . well i bought it . our son this carrier since he born october , we april he still rides it he weighs almost 19lbs . babies these types carriers seem happiest . they spend 40 weeks you , what makes you think when they born they want away you.it also great babies colicit best wrap ever !!! 1 . this creates no pressure points all !!! you don't feel it your shoulders or lower back . massage therapist i highly recommend it b/c it not ruin your posture i feel his weight my thighs - which me fine - my legs getting stronger2 . i breastfeed him shoulder strap hovering over my breast while i hold him my arms - wherever we go - restaurants , etc .. people never notice they think he sleeping3 . you put baby different positions4 . they take best naps it5 . prepared all attention questions where you bought it how it feels6 . it it soo easy put , but you must watch video it comes . once you get hang it - it ' breeze - i put it less than 30 seconds7 . instead looping wrap through rings hold it place i just tie it into knot8 . you two free handsenjoy !!!!!!!	1
i spent alot money trying out new bottles various different nipples sizes . these far best bottles market . i read feeback other people left bottles leaking extra cleaning parts , but bottles perform really well . i never leaking issue them cleaning not big deal considering what product delivers . bottle helps reduce air gasiness babies get regular feeding bottles including over-rated playtex drop ins . drop ins too costly still get air inside them if you set bottle down	1
my 3 year-old daughter received this christmas gift . basket , canned goods , produce pieces very nice . boxes , however , very flimsy hollow cardboard showing wear after only three days play , so i know they won't last long . this price i don't expect wooden boxes , but solid cardboard construction would better design age range which this set marketed . my daughter likes this set very much , i think it give her lots enjoyment while it lasts	1
this one best gifts we received our twins ! both girls cried horribly when cold wipes touched their bottoms . which horrible those middle-of-the-night changes when you want disturb them little possible . grant you wipes don't stay hot very long but they take chill out . quot ; drying-outquot ; wipes , instructions say add 1/4 cup water if needed , which works great . we've only add water once , cheap brand wipes weren't very wet begin . i definately recommend this mothers multiples ! i plan buy keep downstairs ( our nursery second floor ) those in-between changes	1
i recieved this warmer christmas gift when my daughter month old . i think its great !! i haven't trouble wipes getting dry .... but those who , please note owners manual which says add some water keep wipes getting dry . no , wipes don't stay warm long but idea this product take chill off wipes , not make them hot . i don't any complaints this product i recommended it seveal my friends . i feel it definite must	1
this support used almost anything ( bouncers , swing , strollers ) . i bought it use my baby jogger stroller it works wonderfully . there actually snuzzler designed specifically baby jogger which costs more . this same product without baby jogger brand name costs almost $15 less ! i gave only 4 stars because head support kind thick pushed my baby head forward , so i removed it . but she already 3 months old when i bought it , so it might work well newborns	1
snuzzler one my favorite things use my preemie son . he larger preemie , coming home 6 lbs , but it still great help , he still small . it makes car rides enjoyable him , i think he feels cuddled it , just we cuddle him . it also great sit him if he rough night sleeping .... we'll sit him his carseat within minutes he out like light	1

my 2-year old starting potty training process . it perfect size . only thing could make it better if it wrapped around toilet little further . way he could stand closer toilet when he pees . i don't think you'll find step stool like so this next best thing	1
love this set toys . great babys teeth work cordination.my grand son just loves this set.so happy i found it	1

this monitor initially indispensable caring our twins . default channel too much static use , but once we switched over ' ' setting , stopped problem . i hear everything through monitor , even able distinguish my two children breathing . i love option turn off sound see whether babies noisy - one my girls hated bedtime until she few months old , this allowed us let us see whether she still crying after 5 minutes without go room or listen i-hate-bedtime screaming . after nine months daily use , receiver stopped working , but this decent value price . i found safety first monitor i bought picked up sounds this one base , but increased sensitivity . it would nice if nightlight could turned without monitor relaying sound , but option turn nightlight off fine	1

crib set itself stunning- if you like something contemporary . i ordered it baby age same thing happen- received pink feeding pillow . they weren't very helpful or pleasant way they handled transaction . they not honour advertised price . i ended up buying ultra bedding set local boutique	1
i own 2 these - one each stroller . it so convenient keeping my daughter toasty without mess bulky sweaters coats only need removing once we reach our destination . also saves me trouble wake her - i just peel back top cover , or zip it off altogether . also , i've received countless compliments how stylish practical it , not mention water resistent , which great seattle !	1

great seat . we read reviews somewhere complaining their infant head flopped forward this seat . i installed it so it more reclining position while still within range- per level indicator . we no trouble although we always support his head car seat so it cant flop around .	1
these simply best bottles . far leaks go ... you probably cap screwed down too tight ... what happened us ... loosen it little voila ... no more leaks .	1
my husband i purchased avent bottles our newborn after doing our research best bottles helping minimize gas , colic etc ... yikes ! needless say , we highly disappointed avent . recommendation our pediatrician , we went out bought new set dr. brown bottles --- kine pricey , but worth every penny !! avent , my son getting super gassy colicky . he would cry so hard gas pains he'd clinch his little fists , crunch his little legs his tummy practically go hoarse . burping , mylicon gripe water didn't even help . our days nights sleepless -- he wouldn't nap because he crying -- our nights would average 3-4 hours sleep . now , dr. brown's---our son new little man . he still gets gas , but not like he avent bottles . all it takes couple little pats his back he gives us couple good burps he out into la la land---he now able take his naps sleeping anywhere 6-8 hours through night now past 2 weeks --- he only 1 month old . :) some reason , when he feeding avent , he would suck uncontrollably , i'd see lots bubbles his bottle nipple i could hear him sucking all air . dr. brown , he way more controlled sucking , it much more rhythmic no air bubbles nipple ! many thumbs up dr. brown's!	1
5 months old no colic , no spit ups . these bottles great . you could shake them seconds bubbles disapear . while you feed your little one watch amazed there no bubbles . it takes while clean them . you just gotta it when your little one asleep	1

" baby " gate extensions fantasticly easy install i am extremely happy my purchase . extensions added mere seconds . this perfect choice keep my dog out area he not allowed into	1
we big gap before our bedroom , we needed fact 2 these extensions make our gate fit . now one , it seemed it would sturdy , but 2 extension , it gets little flimsy whole gate fall off wall if you press foot pedal too hard or shove gate mistake ..	1
my husband i received this warmer our baby shower while it great not walk downstairs warm bottles early morning feedings , after sofia hit 5 months , we never used it again . she 9 months old now it sits shelf her nursery waiting baby #2 . i wouldn't buy it myself , but i'd give it gift . i say because it'll get more mileage than typical cute outfit cost same .	1

this great addition my medela [ ... ] pump ( car adapter ) . when i pump work , it frees my hands other things . it may take few extra seconds attach , but worth it . only drawback hooks attach bra . they easily fall off when not use . i remember take them off put them somewhere safe	1
beware this product not contain normal sized medicines . they only 1/2 oz bottles gas drops , saline drops , acetomeniphen , decongestant , only 3/16 oz teething gel . you go through any these medications very quickly . but probably why kit costs $20 instead jj $40 one . it good this stuff emergencies when you don't know what you need ahead time . my baby loved taste gas drops , but we used up bottle week unfortunately . little fevers wonderful bring her first shots but didn't last much longer than . nasal aspirator wonderful ... so much easier her nose than hospital one ! it also clear tip so you see when it needs clean out . i wish it came electrolytes packet too , but i guess you can't everything . it worth $20 ( almost ) everything you need your fingertips , but i wish i didn't replace medicines so soon . i would still recommend this over jj kit since you never know what you'll need what you won't use .	1
my friend bought this me because she swore it her son . it excellent . first all , i must say , gas drops just amazing . my daughter so many problems colic gas i used them all time . they work wonders . saline drops great winter during cold season . i already repurchase few items . case great because it keeps everything one place so i don't search stuff .	1
my husband i tried many different bottle types brands decided these best . my 6 week old daughter adjusted well them . original brown nipples wear out very quickly but , silicone ones much nicer last longer . these bottles very easy use clean . my husband prefers soft bottle liners over preformed dropins . soft ones haven't leaked us once but formed ones slipped out under ring couple times spilling formula everywhere . formed ones also make it harder screw lid tight enough causing leaks . soft liners might take little bit longer put bottle deal , but long run it takes less time because you don't go change your clothes every time preformed ones leak . they worth every penny i spent them . even though they may cost more than standard bottles because buy liners , they help prevent gas colic . they absolutely wonderful	1
we got this our son when he 1 yr old , it looks brand new , year later . our child average size , he got plenty room it , age 2 . we live major city , so our stroller gets lot use . this blanket very durable , grows your child , keeps them warm comfy coldest temperatures . stays place , easy install/remove	1

not exactly your little little ones . this type toy baby who ready explore . but otherwise great fun toy it smells good too	1
i would highly recommend this booster parents their children reach proper height weight . it comfortable , light easy maneuver . able put straps across child proper height ( adjustable way ) extremely important their safety - since you use straps car , they go right over bulky winter clothing without readjust like our old seat . i would strongly encourage people remember belt seat even when no one using it . it could become quite projectile during accident if not secured	1
i purchased this booster seat my middle child . she very tiny , so i didnt want seat no back . this seat very padded , very comfortable , she loves arm rests flip up down . i some research before purchasing , this seat rated well . it rated well safety comfort . it also easy install light weight .	1
we've using our diaper dekor more than two years now . all time , dekor held up wonderfully . after hearing friends complain two-handed requirements diaper genies like , we went dekor because easy , one-handed operation appealing -- just stomp pedal throw diaper . we also glad product so well-reviewed ; it turns out those good ratings very well deserved . our dekor works so well we keep it family room , where we spend most our time ( bonus : we don't run upstairs every time we need change diaper ! ) -- we certainly wouldn't if there odor problem . only time we've noticed any odor during summer , when it really hot contents get ... ah ... ripe faster , even then it only when lid open . other than few super-hot weeks each year , we empty dekor once week all well . interior dekor , where diapers collected , gotten touch stinky over last couple years , but you don't smell it until you open door empty unit . little lysol helps , but frankly , long smell doesn't " escape " dekor , it non-issue us -- so far , so good ! refills may seem more expensive than other systems , but they last forever . my first son , we used only four refills two years . i highly recommend dekor , wouldn't even consider diaper disposal system . hope you're happy it we	1
after searching searching " perfect " car seat ( still affordable ) we found graco snugride . it easy install , after you buckle seatbelt just make sure you pull your seatbelt all way out until you hear your " autolock " kick then slowly release seatbelt back . once it back your seatbelt hold seat place without testher strap . my daughter using this car seat 6 months now i haven't issue it . it easy take out base or without my daughter it . i love 5 point safety points it , it makes me feel like she truly safe she , she grows it easy adjust straps	1
we use this storage feeding set every day . we bought other feeding bottles , but breastmilk these bottles sure creates convenience great speed . we use these store milk freezer and/or fridge , then whenever baby hungry daddy or/and sitter simply attaches nipple cap , places bottle bottle-warmer - voila - it all ready matter few mins . no fuss transferring milk freezer bags into bottles . also , because nipple bottle when bottle placed warmer , nipple gets all warm supple , which our baby prefers ( rather than cold/harder nipple )	1
this excellent double bedrail , once it put together , it very easy remove , resize , put bed , etc . we double bedrail folds travel but getting it fit under mattress pain . first years rail makes adjustment easy . but prepared - it comes completely apart takes tools , patience , time put together . our other bedrail much easier put together	1
i got this my second kid , i would going crazy without it ! my baby too small(6 1/2lbs ) my baby bjorn(8lbs min . ) which i used my toddler when he baby . i go anywhere , anything while wearing it , my toddler my full attention while i'm keeping my baby close . it so easy breastfeed , no adjustments needed like bjorn , no one even tell ! my toddler 30lbs even enjoys ride sometimes fun ! those who complain pain should first put strap over shoulder bone , not muscle , then realize you still carrying baby your body sling won't make weight disapear ! when my toddler it , i'm still carrying 30 lbs but it spread over my body , not just my arms hip ! i not any problems straps loosening , it fits me perfectly i'm 5'6 " . i highly recomend it , just realize it may take getting used if you aren't used carrying weight your back . this sling awesome it doesn't make me feel like hippi	1
i would whole heartedly recommend this product . i tried diaper genie could never figure out how change out bag , or hardly how use thing . diaper dekor , i pulled it out box it ready go . when it time change liner ( which last long time , i shocked ) it very straight forward . it didn't even require reading directions ( who time when you baby after reading all parenting books other safety manuals ) . it bit more expensive , but definitely worth extra $10 hands free bag changing ease . plus , if diapers sit it less than week it really doesn't start smelling very much , but go over week you start smell it	1
strange title , i know , but keep reading you'll understand it perfectly . first all , liners last long time easy use refill . i really like how there very handy very child safe cutting blade liners mounted onto inside lower changing door . i noticed some reviewers stating they problems item controling odor , while most other no trouble all . taking this into account , i purchased my diaper dekor open mind . i no trouble first 5 months . then i also noticed odor my son room , even when unit empty , after i wiped down outter lid , inner lid , flaps , inside out . then it occured me : there condensation inside liner bag when i emptied it then used blade cut it . i wondered if maybe bacteria or something moisture now blade then causing smell . so , i pumped some alcohol based hand sanitizer onto blade see what would happen . smell went away . i then thought , " that just too easy , bit crazy . it can't simple " . so , i waited until i noticed smell again couple months later . i used hand sanitizer again , lo behold , smell once again went away . gist it , if you're going put wast material into something where it going sit few days before you get rid it , it going start decompose . diaper dekor great controlling those icky germs bacteria keeping them one safe place . problem , decomposisition creats heat , more decomposing solid matter , longer sits , warmer it all becomes . so , if temperature inside your waste recepticle warmer ( which it ) than surrounding room temperature , condensation form . so when you cut liner empy unit , clean blade . no odor . no problems	1
i love using system . it great upstairs not really yell . monitor allows us tell them we coming help them . they know we way help them or scare away monsters night	1
person this blanket very cute very soft it perfectly matches all other items zanzibar line . two giraffe design you see picture above embroidered lower right hand corner blanket other than caramel colored ultrasuede hem around edges , it only design . dimentions blanket not listed above but it 29 " 39 " slight amount stretch pulling it across width but doesn't any stretch pulling it across length . this makes blanket easy use swaddling infant . it made 100% polyester but you'd never know it feel . it looks feels just like softest fluffy fleece yet when you wash blanket it doesn't shrink . care instructions machine wash cold separately tumble dry low . not iron or use bleach .	1
we tried couple different solutions " head-flop " problem newborn carseat . these worked best . they're easy adjust even when they're closed ( velcro very strong ) which plus when you don't want wake baby up	1
i 4 potty , this far best one . i even bought baby bjorn thinking it would best which wrong . this only potty prevents my son leaking without hard deflector hurt his thighs . i admit he really liked his elmo seat ( which horrible deflector among other things ) so i bought elmo stickers stuck them very outer edges sides so now he loves this seat well , sometimes it takes lot time waiting your little one go i've noticed this seat there no red marks anywhere his body this potty , it very soft no hard seems . price unbelievable .	1
i love this product . our baby loved swaddled this product worked perfectly ! because you velcro it closed , it didn't come undone during night . i purchased one every new mom i know	1
i've got active fun loving baby boy . most babies , he goes through several changes clothing frequently . i use this tote bin his laundry bin , it works great ! i keep it next his crib , just throw whatever needs washing into it , clothes , bedding , toys , whatever . after it filled , it makes good small/medium load washing . it attractive looking , stands up well its own , 2 cutout reinforced holes easy toting , contains messes well . it also doubles toy/mess pickup bin , great tote toys or other items . size not too deep reach into , adults or babies . if you fill this tote w/ small toys , baby play w/ it quite while , taking things out , putting things back looking mirror side . since it soft bin , no need worry baby would bump little head it . i think this better size/depth than sea life pop up organizer . i exchanged organizer this , love convenience it(the organizer no handle tote around , too deep get people w/ bad backs or small children ) . i also matching toy box , which i also love very much . they look great together my son nursury , both durable , easy clean , safe baby play	1
my son would easily fall asleep , but hard time staying asleep . we tried swaddling him blankets , but he would always escape no matter how tight we thought we it wrapped . velcro swaddle me blanket helped keep him buddled tightly . he would smile me when i would get blanket out before he went sleep . my son born early summer so flannet blanket worked awhile , but cotton blanket great hot nights . my baby almost 10 pounds when he born 22 inches long so i ended up buying large size eventually . small size still got lot use since we used it every night . my son doesn't need swaddled so tightly likes his hands free , now he 4 months old , but i sometimes use small size naps . you wrap it lower body secure baby legs , but they their hands free . i lots friends babies right now ; swaddle me blanket always included part their gift .	1

fisher price ( fp ) designs many bouncers , but this style best due leg design . some fp bouncers very stiff legs so they not bounce easily . legs curve/bow out seat ( check out image product ) . because this leg design you easily place your foot bounce baby . my baby fall asleep me bouncing then i turn vibration leave her . i wasn't crazy pink design , but i know leg design offered bunny print well , but appears discontinued . key thing find fp bouncer legs curve/bow out seat base	1
i loved fact this folded half so it gives you more space your trunk groceries . it soooo narrow it fit any ailes stores . it really easy open close . only reason i didn't give it five stars because i lift infant seat up every time i wanted get my diaper bag underneath . basket soooo small very hard get when infant carrier place so i would put my cell phone , keys , wallet three pockets handle solved problem	1
i bought this carrier shortly before i flew my baby first time . we peg car seat , i didn't want schlepp my peg stroller through airport , etc . while vacation . my surprise , i find i use my combi flash much more often than my peg stroller . it very lightweight , very easy pop open , held up well through various trips . i also like it handlebar goes all way across , because it much easier steer ( especially one-handed ) . my husband also tricky time removing plastic parts you pull off order make this work peg ; once they off , though , stroller breeze . i would give one word warning : you careful this stroller it ( 1 ) popped all way open ( there audible clicking noise when this happens ) ( 2 ) car seat carrier strapped . peg carseat sort just rests top carrier , which makes it bit susceptible tipping over uneven surfaces .	1
if you fussy baby or just bottle feed , dr. brown best . we twin girls first 3 months they gased up it not fun . someone recommended dr. brown bottles , which we willing try anything , they best thing we ever used . if you fussy baby then you know what i am talking . if you giving gift baby shower , this best gift you could give . i can't say enough good things dr. brown . i upset our doctor not tell us these bottles , instead she us giving them drops buying most expensive formula market . nothing worked until these bottles	1

i've waited while add my 2 cents this pump , i honestly say it keeper . it very comfortable efficient . i still pump 2x day my daughter now 11 months . love embrace	1
this great pump ! first i looking pumps cost around $70 range . i am so glad i decided spend extra money ! my daughter not too keen breastfeeding it just turned into horrible experience i'd like forget . hospital i provided medela pump . ouch !!! my breasts sooo sore using thing , it not comfortable all ! cups breast this hard plastic when it would pump , my poor nipples getting so sore then i use nipple cream make them feel better . i actually could not anything my breasts while i hospital because they so sore . it made me so grouchy i just let everything hang out . i didn't care who came room !!! when i came home started using playtex pump , it such relief ! cups breasts soft rubbery feel them they didn't stretch or pull my nipples while pumping . 5 speed/suction controls very nice . it come storage kit but it only provides 4 storage thingy . i buy 2 extra storage kits so i enough contraptions use storing milk . i really hope makes sense ! then there liners . i liners coming out my ears ! i guess that how playtex makes their money , you buy tons liners ( don't forget storage kits ) . pump little loud when suction set higher . i used it 4 months everything worked great . i definitely recommend this pump . i would given it 5 stars but my only gripe spending extra money storage kits countless number liners you buy . but ... it world difference medela playtex .	1

my wife i 3 children ages 3 under so we've got baby monitors all over house . we've used i think total 5 differet models 4 different manufacturers including fisher-price , graco , summer , sony . we've used both audio/video audio only . this fisher-price model far best we've used . - range . we approximately 1500 sqft floor where we sleep . our bedroom opposite end floor youngest baby room . other receives either didn't pickup all or when they they full static background noise so much so there continual hissing static we constantly endure . this receiver set very low volume so background noises almost silent but baby still easily heard . - rechargable . other monitor receivers it hassle move room room . you unplug receiver find somewhere else plug it . one other models offer battery backup but we didn't use it fear going through batteries all time . this receiver built rechargable battery . unplug it take it you . when you're plug it back it charges ready next use . we're very pleased not only quality but also price . amazon price nearly $30 less than babies us	1

we use this constantly every room our house . let you keep baby bed you without fear rolling over him , makes any flat surface into comfy baby bed	1
we loved idea this item ... we didn't use it our bed but crib instead bassinette , when we away home , or sofa . our son 22 " birth so he outgrew this ( unfortunately ! ) time he month old . it really only suitable small babies . also , " mattress " split two due folding capacity ( not sure how else this though ) which makes it seem somewhat less comfortable . only one half removable , washable cover .	1
my son thought toys attached potty really interesting , sounds kept him entertained . it helped him get over fear sitting potty . we move regular potty actually get him use potty though .	1
this wonderful product ... whenever it says or sings anything it brings bright smile my sons face . very easy assemble just plain great	1
we bought this stroller take recent trip europe it perfect travel stroller . i lot research strollers i really leaning towards getting maclaren , but when we went actually looked all different strollers this one stood out . it much lighter than maclaren it snack tray , which incredibly useful if your child old enough use sippy cup nibble crackers , etc . ( we bought this our then 1.5 year old . ) we must gotten lucky , because i've never any problems wheels like some reviewers mentioned , i steer this one hand easily . seat reclines nearly all way down basket underneath useful carrying extra baby items or small shopping bags . it take two hands close , which little bit annoying . it also kind bulky even when it closed . sun visor too small much good , so i wound up throwing my baby sling over it times help block sun my little guy . ( it seemed like every travel stroller we saw this problem though . ) it very light weight easy carry when it closed . my husband carried this up down tube stations all over london ( backpack our five year old times ) he didn't any problems . we also traveled eastern europe few weeks this stroller got serious workout both city countryside . it held up really well we're still using it our second back up stroller . only bad thing sippy cup attachment came off during flight back we haven't able find replacement . also grown-up cup holder complete joke fell off after only few uses . overall though , i'm really pleased this stroller would buy it again .	1

i got this sling when my first son 1.5 months old i trying shop target . he screaming his car seat so i put it right store !!! i liked it because i could nurse him it while wearing nursing top - much easier than bjorn , nobody see what you doing . padded lip sling actually really great , it helps prop baby head up , also keeps them slipping out , which almost happened sling my cousin lent me . i am now using it my second son , sometimes i slip sling off me when he sleeping tuck it around him he stays asleep , although you make sure you place it such way ring doesn't get way or baby doesn't get tangled " tail . " i don't this all time , but it nice way get him sleep when he really hard time , because sling smells like mommy , he feels comfy . i've taken sling everywhere , my older son still likes it , even though he tad over weight limit . i didn't give it 5 stars because really tiny infants my sons not like this . now though , we use it lot around house when we don't want fiddle bjorn - great way deal separation anxiety . if you really clever , there way wear it so you older child your back . my older son likes lot !	1

(; wipes away easy enough though ! if you go babies us , you find baby einstein crayons $3.99 . nice replacement same sleeves included . colors include red , green , yellow , blue , black orange . eta : easiest way i've found clean tub after couple sessions crayon play it spray surfaces scrubbing bubbles , let it sit few moments , wipe away . there bit more elbow work required otherwise	1
this seat our 3 month old daughter who weighs 15 pounds . first , i'll point out pros this bouncer seat . music wonderful . waterfall captivating . colors mesmerizing . she sit seat 25 minutes easily . seat takes 4 d-size batteries . unlike other bouncer seats we used , there only one compartment 4 d-sized batteries . unlike its predecessor ( ocean wonder aquarium ) , rainforest bouncer keeps our child awake . if we wanted our child sleep , we'd put her bed , not bouncer . so fisher price definitely got it right this time ! a++ ! cons seat used twice before it started make this loud clicking noise bar . engineer , i took it apart noticed gears designed click ( or skip gear ) if child grab frog or monkey while it moving . this prevents gears stripped or motor overheating . however , tension this " gear skipping " behavior too sensitive such after 3 hours use , clicking occurs just friction frogs moving up down bar . i called customer support clicking they promptly sent replacement bar . after 2 weeks using new bar , it started clicking . argh ! good thing new bar it randomly . we're willing live flaw annoying clicking time time pros listed above . other con questionable . there much debate height toys bar . " infant " bouncer , it designed such child grab toys even pull rings off monkey . our daughter loves it ! we fisher price " kick play " which designed slightly older children it provides more clearance child toys ... hence " kick play . " bouncer comes one-year warranty . so year , i get replacement bars clicking becomes annoying . after replacing enough them , their engineers fix problem ? i hope so . 19 march 2007 : clicking returned replacement bar won't go away . i called fisher price replacement bar . while they really wanted send voucher $48 , i pressed toy bar sent replacement . point , customer service informed me there backlog replacements this bar till 30 april 2007 . customer service continues very friendly easy deal . we're willing wait new bar ...	1

this product really great . it inexpensive white noise maker help baby sleep . i like i plug it it runs all night . now when my son wakes night he settle himself back sleep it also helps him nap longer during day . only negative it not remember your standard settings every time you turn it . each time you turn it volume low sound ocean . also , if you power outage , battery backup kick , however , not before sound resets low volume ocean sounds . i say i think i sleep better hearing " rain " over monitor	1
i've not bought one these yet , but after seeing it person , we're definitely getting one couple months our new baby . it very small , great our 1bdr nyc apartment . people reviewed this previously don't mention incredible amount space this would save small living area . since we don't extra room our child , this perfect . seems much more sturdy than any wood portable cribs . particle board under mattress , you could very easily reinforce it board , or metal braces . you remove wheels if , later time , it worries you your toddler would standing bed . it 2 adjustable heights . seems really good me	1
model amazon sells j5933 , but there new 2007 model , l1907 . amazon doesn't sell new model apparently i don't know what differences them . i checked fisher-price website it doesn't say , but they list both models . i ordered mine amazon march 9 , 2007 . chair exactly what we looking . our dining area fairly small so using our existing dining chair save space . booster chair feels secure it secures both behind under dining chair buckle straps . it also non-skid rubber feet bottom all four corners . 3-point 5-point harness helpful keeping baby place . we using one those cheapy plastic block booster chairs our 7-month old kept slouching underneath tray . countoured seat space saver high chair helps prevent tha t.t he adjustable height useful raising tray just above our table level so we could slide whole chair underneath when not use . i'm not sure when we'd recline seat , but i guess it nice option . chair reminds me car seat , such , keeps our baby place while feeding . one-handed release tray highly adjustable settings convenient options . i don't think i could ask anything more out booster chair . perhaps built-in ipod adapter speakers built into tray or something . just kidding :	1
i bought this my new grandson my daughter told me how great it . she doesn't bundle him up constantly , just put him this he ready go . plus it keeps him nice warm we live cold climate	1
i agree other posters -- this pillow stuffing not held up like i'd expect boppy . it almost if someone besides boppy made it put boppy label it ; but design exactly what i've come expect boppy : innovative unbeliveably useful . i using this pillow since i 6 months pregnant , my baby now almost 17 months old . i just can't give it up . my husband i fight over it so much ( he loves it , too , calls it " comma pillow " ) , i'm considering getting him his own christmas ! shape provides so much back bip support , even when you're not pregnant . i honestly don't think i would gotten any sleep during my pregnancy if it hadn't this pillow , little tail ( small end pillow ) provide amazing support your lower back when you're nursing your side ( which means i able get sleep during those first few months " sleepless " nights , also ! ) my pillow came washable case , so i toss washer . pillow start separate after few months , but i've tried keep it fluffed regularly ; i think that helped it stay one piece instead separating fully into two sections . all all , i highly recommend this pillow ; but , one other poster noted , it matter personal taste -- body shape -- whether it become your favorite or deemed poor investment . i've definitely gotten my money worth , likely buy one when this one wear out -- even if i don't baby	1
i don't find too many things anymore exceed my expectations . this product one them . my son strong active . he would constantly climb out crib would land floor head first . one those occasions he go hospital because he hurt himself bad . i not know what until i went online found this product . it saved us all . i put it together myself it pretty simple best all it works . i thought my son would able break it because he strong but not case . he likes it . it keeps him he even thinks it tent play . it cozy . no more scares . zipper make alot noise i sew few spots because seam so tight it tends rip few spots . i purchased it december i am still talking it . great product	1
this chair works extremely well worth every penny . it extremely easy clean , comfortable toddler use . i would strongly recommend this potty chair every parent	1
when i ordered gym my baby 2 months old , she now 3 months old it best thing since sliced bread !! every morning she plays under it one full hour . there so much her accessories interchangable , so you add toys lower toys raise toys . it easy pack up take , so we take it when we visit relatives	1
i use mirror my front windshield , so i keep my rearview mirror road , it hasn't fallen time . i larger mirror attaches back seat , where i see my baby , she see herself . seat protector saving my leather , i've no issues all sunshades . this great value $9.99 , seat protector alone costs $13.00 . if this stuff all purchased separately , you'd pay $30 . i'm very pleased this purchase	1
i bought this my newborn granddaughter " sight unseen " . it soft , warm , works perfectly velcro closures . she also some receiving blankets but hasn't used them all swaddling because this item works so well so convenient	1
i bought one these while pregnant w/our five-day-old daughter , i never anything like it w/our first two daughters . let me just say , this one simple product renders any other blanket obsolete . it soft , pretty , cozy , easy use ( i always lousy swaddling w/regular receiving blankets ! ) , impossible get out , she loves it . i'm going out tomorrow buy five more , lol	1
i am very pleased my purchase . i 3 year old daycare 1 year old 3 year old so wanted something i could walk baby let older ones rest when needed . this works great ! it isn't hard wrists like i found most double strollers . easily steered . only things " missing " cup holder which you buy i think rubber wheels would better suited stroller especially outside strolls . but other than i am very pleased	1
i like this product so much i am taking precious daddy sleep time write this review 3:00 am what appears tail-end ( oh , god , please ) week-long , growth spurt , every 1 1/2 2 hour porky pig feeding frenzy my firstborn three week old . granted , this took few overheated bottles little practice get it right . first , we pretty . o . ' we couldn't get this thing heat consistently ( my wife doc i'm lawyer so you'd think two us we could heat up four ounces milk , but nooooo -- apparently you need phd nuclear physics accomplish this ) . after ten tries , i started get feel it , now , i don't even measure water- i just dump bunch start counting . going time produces much more consistent results than relying water measuring , which if exact precision would probably work perfectly . me , holding el porko one arm manipulating faucet water measuring flask bit rough , so again , me , just counting off ten alligators pulling bottle works great . i'd recommed company devise flask utilizes sliding mechanism slot so you get exact amount water each time excess water spilling-off . sidenote , we use chilled expressed milk avent bottles i find : 1 . leaving lid bottles makes it easier remove four ounce bottles steaming warmer ; 2 . squeezing nub ? ( bulge right below nipple tip ) avent bottle releases pressure built up heating ; 3 . swirling bottle gently after pulling it warmer good thing ; 4 . once week cleaning seems all maintenance this thing needs . i griped my mother sometimes inconsistent heat , which she laughed told me , " go boil some water , pour it cup , drop your bottle , wait 10 minutes bottle warm up , clean up mess you made , then complain me how hard you it . " point well taken . thinking it , you'd need some sort temperature probe or something monitor milk temp itself really get exact results every time . maybe they'll some doodad like time i grandkids . this warmer , avent bottles , hard-to-find gerber anti-gas relief simethicone drops made my life much , much easier ( oh yah , lots excederine coffee too ) . kid fed , burped , oh yah baby , sleeping so i am off night night . life goooood	1
i really like this warmer . its small it works fast . there little water holder attaches side unit keep water ready when you need it . just add water , put bottle wait 2-3 minutes . only problem i warmer i use water bottle room tempature so if i leave bottle entire warming time it gets too hot my baby drink . so i just take it out after 1 minute , check it my wrist it usually ready . if you taking cold bottle refridgerator warming it , you leave it full warming time 2 - 3 minutes . i highly recommend this warmer	1
i tried several types nursing pads found these far most comfortable . i never problem leakage or " fuzzies " left behind pads . i actually throw away box johnson johnson pads i bought because they so itchy fuzzy , i found thinner types pads too flimsy me . while avent pads bulky , because i am not back into my normal slim-fitting clothes yet , i haven't problem pads showing through .	1
i picked this up my local brus store . i've snack cup only going 6 yrs now umbrella stroller got this set my 3rd child new combi savvy ex stroller . stroller came soft pack accessory holder angled handles stroller but i needed more drink holders my 2 older children us adults . it worked perfectly us i didn't any problems installing clamps - more details later . very dark navy set ( pictured ) blends well my black silver stroller . this what set comes what it : 1 ) 2 clips/clamps large small crews ( used large screws fit around oval tubing my stroller ) allen wrench . i think more clips would've nice so people could use more attachments so i'm going try find long screws replace small screws i used clip my old umbrella stroller . 2 ) 3 different sized " " shaped bottle holders ( pop bottle neck ) use small size normal water bottles , medium gerber styled baby bottles wide-mouthed water bottles ( i.e. propel gatorade ) large avent style baby bottles . 3 ) big cup holder - it already assembled so we haven't problems arms popping out , other reviewers stated . it attached clips 2 sides , one where cup swivel ( why ??? i don't know ) or other where it stationary . 4 ) double-cupped snack cup connected lids swivel open . 5 ) mesh bag small ( 7 9.5 inches ) but people - i think this bag hold all attachment parts ! 6 ) 2 large " " hooks 2 small " " hooks . they look flimsy but they work . keep mind , you aren't supposed load up your stroller heavy items anyway ( so it won't tip over ) so don't expect hang your loaded cooler it ! we used both large hooks , one bag held my bjorn baby carrier other bag snacks small pint sized water bottles it . i multi-colored " " hooks manufacturer - they very sturdy swivel but they not fit tubes this stroller . note : i not seen large enough hooks aluminum oval tubes these newer strollers . so these very useful b/c basket underneath our stroller hold good amount but not enough productive day mall :-) other reviewers rated this item low what i think unwarranted reasons or high expectations after-market stroller accessory . this item not work every stroller out there . yes , big cup holder stick out bit but zoo or mall we haven't anything fall out . put some forethought into placement clamps you won't frustrated putting them . re : installation : i recommend closing your stroller first look it over possible locations clamps . then when first installing clamps , test closing your stroller before totally tightening screws . our combi , it goes right above clamps you pull closes stroller right under included accessory pack . later when our baby starts eating snacks i see possible place it right next seat frame but then front rail stroller 2 cup holders it so i think we'll really end up keeping 2 clips up top us . location it now angled yes , your attachments end up holding your drinks straight . attachment pieces octagonal shape so when you pop piece , it straight . taking piece off easy , you only need hold clamp one hand pull piece off . don't forget take these attachments off before closing stroller throwing it trunk your car b/c items may pop-off get lost or they may break . this set really worked well us price good . we set drinks whole family full day theme parks zoo ! good luck	1
i purchased this my aria twin stroller , but i ended up using it my triple jogging stroller . it works like dream , but it just didn't fit oblong tubing aria . bummer	1
this product every mother should it definitely hard part when my daughter got older . it cleans not only avent but dr. brown bottles too when placed correctly . it definitely worth money its very efficient .	1
it so simple , makes your life so much easier !!! lit close if you turn it until you find right position . also , remember not sterilize more than 4 bottles time . it just works perfectly . my baby 8 months now i've using it since she born . great	1

i worried constantly woke up dozens times each night check my son . since i purchased this , i sleep much better . it great product . i not purchase thing put it ... i just placed my large children book	1
this wonderful product . i am first time mom , neurotic , i know . but there such difference my peace mind this monitor . i highly recommend it . we three false alarms , only because our daughter very active sleeper jammed herself into corner crib , out range . even then , it worth it . i'd rather know if she her face buried crib bumper so i slide her out middle . it great , i can't say enough . i'm so glad i am kids now when there products like these available	1
i purchased this use hamper our baby girls room . bright colors flower work great her nursery . hamper it okay . top only unzips halfway so you need use two hands drop laundry . also remember it collapsable fall over if anything dropped top it	1
i actually pretty impressed this potty , just happened across amazon see what price here ( i buy it bm , wanted double check see if i overpaid ) . this child #2 . child #1 potty , but potty trained span week never even sat it ( she used training seats instead ) . child #2 , well , not so good . after few weeks unsuccessful attempts training seat , i decided get him potty . i read reviews here first , i never would bought this one . luckily , bm my first stop i ended up two these potties ( one home , one grandma ) . pros : works advertisedeasy assembly cleanupdecent battery lifeinexpensivecons : musical fanfare follows successful ' drop ' isn't foolproof , sometimes fail activate . deflection cup front little awkwardly placed , causing some collision ( i elaborate one ? :) summary:it under twenty bucks , assembles minutes , doesn't eat batteries . ok , sometimes music won't work - it not exactly high precision laser sensing toilet ( if such animal exists ) . it'll still work 90% time . i bought expensive potty child #1 , trust me - although it cost more than double price this unit , there no appreciable differences two . it easy clean , inexpensive , works advertised . i wish more kids items managed meet these simple requirements	1
friend daughter recommended this highly , so we bought it three years ago our son . it waste money . he never used it , went straight big john . three years later , my daughter delighted her hand-me-down . i don't know what tell you . it great or not ? small price , it worth trying	1
i bought bright stars play gym my family childcare business . baby loves play this gym . i love it because parts removable placed different spots accomodating baby movements . it also very easy clean	1
since i consider this expensive i gave it 4 stars ... ( i wish there 4 1/2 star rating , it better than 4 stars ) besides expense , i'm quite happy this product . there nothing else market like it ... so , we went ahead purchased it . this adjustable child toilet seat fits onto regular toilet . because toilets come different sizes/etc . there dial(near handle ) which you turn make trainer seat fit snug toilet . i found it easy place toilet plus it so easy remove . some other brands child toilet seats very difficult remove . babybjorn toilet trainer also oval shape opening ... child head won't fit through it . child might try wear it " hat " but it not go down over their head around neck . neither our son or daughter any problems using this seat/trainer . it easy them place toilet remove . our children look so much more " comfortable " sitting this toilet trainer seat instead sitting/falling into toilet when using regular/adult size toilet seat . before purchasing this i also checked out toilet trainer babybjorn website . i impressed information there . i recommend people consider purchasing toilet trainer .	1
i pleasure " test driving " this carrier store my son before we purchased literally walked out it . kickstand great innovation makes loading securing kiddo very painless . straps secure snugli very comfi . there plenty storage room take-along essentials . child seat adjustable so this model grow your little one . best all my son loved ride !! we walked all over store he laughed cooed glee . we plan use this carrier rain forests costa rica so it get true test capability . highly recommended	1

my daughter 6 months old standing since she 4 months old . evenflo classic johnny jump up her favorite thing play . it strenghtened her legs which really helped her learning crawl . jump up allows her more independent she use it any doorway crown molding . this allows her hang out watch mommy every room . jump up easy assemble very strong well safe . it made washable material easy put up take down or pack traveling . i one home one grandma house . it also very affordable . i would give it ****	1
our seven month old daughter not like her tummy so she not like crawl or attempt crawl . she loves kicking we got johnny jump up bug help her use her legs more without laying down her tummy . she loves it . she now loves sitting up kicking her legs making herself move around . since johnny jump up bug not tray it easy get her out she not come close pinching her fingers like reviews jumpers trays usually state . we very pleased quality it low price use it our future kids	1
works well us good reception throughout 2 story 3200 sq ft house . bit static few seconds once while , probably depending position receiver . it background hiss which not hard sleep . 802.11 pre-n router 5.8 ghz cordless phones also which not seem interfere	1
this first cover i've tried it great . i don't plan trying others . it leaked first time i used it because i hadn't adjusted it properly but since i check fit , no leaks !! i use cloth while home cut down costs . i don't recommend them overnight ... but if you want something affordable during day this winner	1
until we moved this packed four months . we didn't think our daughter would able stand cold wipe , so we rushed out purchased this right after she born . it used religiously up point moving . last four months she nothing but room temperature wipes hasn't complained all ! ;) yes , it wonderful wipe her little bottom warm wipe , but this isn't much needed product	1
we returned lionheart warmer got this instead . this one works much better . it actually keeps wipes warm easy use . light handy although we dont use it much . its also easy see if you running low wipes rather than get suprised when you pull out last one . if you need wipe warmer , this one buy .	1
we picked this swing over others because it bright colorful because sound speed options . we don't find motor noisy all ... fact white noise rather calming baby . it taken my son month or two get used it . i think he just noticed moblie week ago ( he 2 months ) i think he gets older play front tray he'll like it much more . good points : * familiar songs ( other baby einstein products)*speed settings really different . * seat reclines quite bit , very comfortable*front tray many options such speech , sound songs well rotation . * parent friendly easy assemble*not " graco green " rather cheerful looking . * removable tray toy great " tummy time " or carseat toy . * cheery , stimulating moblie . * noise adjustable . * good restraint . baby secure . flaws : * mobile too high up newborns . my son didn't notice it until recently , each time i tried point it out , he just looked me instead . * plastic tray sticks so tightly it takes real hard pull open it . it always gives baby jolt . * songs front tray too short i keep go up press it keep him interested . * nature sounds sound more like static than anything else , great idea , just needs clearer . if you don't mind minor flaws its great swing good price compared others	1
i bought this based great review given previous poster her colicky baby . thankfully she not wrong ! i 5 week old who fussy high need moment he born . during day he would only takes nap me carrier night he would only fall asleep bed me my husband . my arms body getting tired carrying him all day . he would never sit his bouncy seat more then 5 minutes so i hesitant purchase piece baby equipment thinking it would not help . i type this he taking his two hour nap all himself ! i put nature sound , which white noise , set swing highest level wow , i able take shower today first time since he born without someone holding him . i never wanted swing , but now i am firm believer power motion infant !	1
great product , especially when you need sterilized bottle hurry	1
i bought this my not-yet-4-month-old daughter it arrived yesterday . i put it together ease ( except short one battery i stole clock house ) . she holding her head up since birth doesn't like laying down anymore . she loved sitting this looking toys . she just now realizing her hands hers use so toys this perfect . her toes barely touch floor so she can't quite jump it . but her rate growth , she jumping few days ! reviewer mentioned placing pillow under baby feet i think i'll try tonight . said , i still wish i bought this sooner . if you thinking buying it , don't wait until your baby older . buy it sooner get your monies worth . even if baby can't reach floor , there great value toys . so far , so good . although she deeply interested this new toy trying figure out what it , i just love it ! i see many hours her enjoyment , mine watching her valuable hands free time me !	1
our 8 month old daughter loves this jumperoo - she literally bounces until she exhausted . she even tries jumping when she not jumperoo anymore . a+ product fisher price	1
this pretty much must-have infant seats , i don't know why they don't just sell them together . bases great because you secure base once seatbelt , then just pop car seat/carrier out simple little latch . it also makes switching other cars same base breeze . definitely get this	1
i disagree genie best . it close , but i like neat better . i've owned several these things ( dekor , champ , genie neat ... why so many ? all issues ... read ) . frankly , dekor champ both smelled ( " smell control " reason i want one these ) , so those two now serve garbage pails other areas our home . genie good controlling odor , but top pain use , top my genie broke after 2 months , so one bites dust . controlling odor , genie neat both best ( they both seal off bad stuff different " sealing-off " mechanisms other models just don't ) . features other reviewers commented they like genie also neat system : -put dirty diaper into clean bag every time-plunge top contain smell section off mess- change bag every few days week . ( our 16-month old daycare m-f , so we only change our two neats once week . never smell . ever . -easy replace liners . takes 30 seconds . ( no smell when changing it , either ) . plus ... -the handle/plunger neat easier use one-handed than genie . just push pull . no grappling get top off or bag grab diaper start twisting ( dirty diaper one hand squirmy baby other ) . -less plastic wasted because it pushes straight down . genie rotates plastic plastic which sends more down chute . you see , i've dumped ton money into this wisdom . but now , i finally stink-free environment my son room , so far , nothing neat broken ( i'm only afraid because it underdog , they're going discontinue it , then refills hard find ) . - if happens , i would try genie hope lid holds out . i rank genie #2 out all these models	1
this night light adorable . i just purchased this add my froggy tales collection . it lights way your little one nursery . i love this line am so glad they came out more accessories . it simple on/off switch seems durable . only improvement i would make would sensor turn off automatically during daylight hours . there also new wall light switch plate part collection , stores , not yet line	1
we using this seat saver 16 months now it not ruined our leather seats . every month i take out ( convertible ) car seat clean seat re-install safety check seats just fine . if your car seat properly installed there no way this seat saver move around . my only suggestion manufacture would make it bit more narrow ... it takes up more space actual vehicle seat than needed . two-stage version only way go	1
we bought this because my our car seat making marks all over seats my car , it get job only thing i wish it liitle taller or it went up over headres	1
there seems quite few choices lamaze animal toys babies ( hippos , giraffes , turtles , etc . ) . i chose larry lion he big hit my 3 1/2 month-old daughter . she grown , she discovered new aspects larry which keep her fascinated . his bright colors quite captivating , his squeaky tummy usually makes her giggle . she also quite enjoys playing his " crinkly " mane , now she teething , i think she really appreciates chewing 2 rings purple star attached his paws . larry already our " stand-by " , fail-safe toy when all other toys fail pique her interest . thumbs-up firs t-t ime parents	1
i bought many potty seats , tried them out this one i stuck . i even tried those " folding travel " seats , but all they slip slide scare my daughter into thinking she going fall . i even bought second take diaper bag . i highly suggest this potty training buy !	1

i love this toilet training seat ! i like it hard , molded plastic , not soft seat . it looks so much nicer bathroom cleans better too . my 3 year old daughter finds it comfortable sit . adjustment knob helps keep seat place . i also like high splash guard front ... girls little fountains too , this only seat we've used keeps everything contained toilet . it well worth extra money	1
regular training seats you place top adult size toilet just not stable enough my son . add fact one our toilets oval it bad fit . also add he very big boy regular seats would allow him pee right over little pee catcher ( don't know official term ;) part ) . he'd say , " mommy - i fall " didn't want try . this seat works great because you adjust it make it fit more stability	1
we loved this product because we didn't remember whole " burrito-wrap " system . only down-side fabric stretch our little houdini figured out way out . but nothing few diaper pins wouldn't solve	1
my infant daughter loves held which hard her two year old brother wanting equal time . this sling helped so much . it same one dr. bailey grey anatomy uses ( except she wears hers upside down - don't know if intentional or not -- hmmm ...	1

very easy put together it rides wonderful our neighborhood trails . my daughter fits snugg seat unlike other strollers we tried . folds up easily , however its little awkard pick up load car .	1
this wonderful product - we got it keep cats out crib . however , zipper wakes up our son almost everytime we try open or close it . so we usually just shut his bedroom door now . maybe our next child won't so sensitive sound . update : now he little older , he isn't waking up it - long we very quietly zip it	1
my husband i over-analyze everything this highchair best we've seen . we started our son solids 4 months , which before he could sit up himself , worked flawlessly ever since . tray easily slides off , even one handed . cover easy wipe down , tray stores itself back chair , harness straps secure , when it folds , it really " space-saver " . leg separator annoying first , but we found it detachable ( foot rest well ) .	1
i recently purchased this 6 piece set , lamp , hamper mobile , our nursery . colors vibrant pastel pinstriped shades blue , sage green , tangerine touches bright yellow . i like brand new package , material touchable isn't stiff board . while this generally listed ' gender neutral ' i think buyers should know there * lot * blue this set . while doesn't matter us , i know some parents prefer more yellows , greens , oranges , etc ... true gender neutrality . embroidered details ( humpty dumpty , cow jumping over moon , etc .. ) quilt , bumper pad , diaper stacker hamper just beautiful . they stand out but not take away prettiness fabric . accessories cute but i think if i paid full price hamper lamp i would less pleased . material hamper great , but wooden structure very flimsy . i foresee this getting put inside closet once baby crawling or it easily pulled over . lamp story book hey diddle diddle ( cow , spoon , dish ) it - very cute - but up close you notice it not painted well . slight distance you don't notice it , but it bug me little considering price . mobile cute , but i not care fact baby only see bottoms stars , moon cow . not nearly exciting ones position animals/shapes down towards baby . would not my first choice mobiles ( i prefer geometric symphony one ) , but since i got this package deal i likely use it . overall : * material nice quality touchably soft*the colors embroidery beautiful*the colors lean bit more towards traditional ' boy ' room versus neutral room light blue main color bumper pad , dust ruffle , hamper valance*hamper , lamp mobile not high quality products crib seti would recommend this crib set friends family sans hamper , lamp mobile . nursery rhyme theme classic well put together here lambs ivy . i rated this 5 stars simply crib set . price amount items included it great deal . if i rating accessories i would not give them more than 3 just average	1

i used both kissaluvs size 1 2 my son , age 6 months - 2 years . he never leaked ! i never problem drying them - perhaps because i live dry climate . my husband loves them too , so they all we used . buy them new $10 each . i used 2 dozen time . my son such wiggle worm i recently bought few fuzzi bunz pocket diapers . i like them better his age ( 2-3 years ) because i don't wrestle diaper cover him . however , they pricey $15 each . i'm baby this month bought dozen size 0 - i need least dozen - but they grow out them so quickly . i heard they best infant diaper . high resale value well .	1

we baby bjorn step stool , potty chair , little potty , now toilet trainer . hind sight 20/20 . toilet trainer step stool all you need . our initial thought potty chair home little potty trips . reality our daughter would sit her potty then want sit toilet like mommy daddy . we balanced her toilet before we decided get toilet trainer . no more balancing acts toilet . she use her step stool get toilet when she wants . toilet trainer travels well , fits all types toilets , easy install , remove , clean ! potty chair little potty fantastic quality but you might well go toilet trainer start	1
i originally looking buying potty chair all bells whistles , flush noises , music , lights , works . then i thought , wait minute , regular potty doesn't those things . she wants one like mommies ! i got this her after asked repeatedly read " potty book girls " she immediately sitting it without any prompting . once i finally took her pants off she went right away . we still working going always potty , but she loves potty itself . it very basic sturdy . my daughter no problem sitting little guard front . i like it separate bowl my daughter so proud when she take it out flush it down " big " potty	1
i got these imse vimse covers my daughter . first i thought i'd like iv more , because it seemed though fit better around leg , but i changed my mind quickly . not only these fit just fine , but they much more durable ! after few washings , iv began loose shape velcro began warp ( i cold water wash line dry ) . bummis look just same when i got them ( except some stains ) . these covers last me through next few babies , i'm sure it ! my only complaint once your baby begins push weight limit it takes little practice get velcro tabs stick right . when my daughter weighed 14lbs . if i didn't fastened tabs just right spot they would come undone , but it didn't take long figure out correct . after comparing these covers others ( my iv bummis original friend mine used ) , these covers come out top ! ps - i wash covers cold water first make them last longer , but it best wash covers hot water disinfect . i started washing bummis hot water ( my diapers ) they're still holding up fine . response other review .... these diapers fold back tabs laundry . i bought these exact covers this exact page mine them	1
we started tub seat bath complete universal bath system first years , but it way too small our baby he slid around it so much we switched bathing him sink while we supported him . when he outgrew sink , we needed alternative , so we bought this bather . it lot like his bouncy seat , which he loves very comfortable . this much easier than supporting all his weight one arm bathing him other while he squirms around . i didn't give it 5 stars because i think it lacking 2 things would make it perfect . one strap like bouncy keep him sliding down , though he doesn't slide too bad ( not like tub ) , other it needs suction cups bottom hold it place tub better	1
i purchased this pillow my son i tired seeing him slumped over his car seat while he slept . restupright pillow , he secure alligned his carseat sleeps straight spine . pillow adjustable fabic really soft . also , its very easy use !! it well-made it comes straps so pillow goes over seatbelt it not slip down while he sleeps	1
i recieved this bumper shower gift i really like colors quality . only thing it doesn't come instructions how attach it your crib its not self-explanitory one might think it would . picture packaging shows pattern facing inwards towards baby , no bumper sliding side rail so i guess you double it back sides but ties end up weird way . we'll see how it works out , but otherwise its good quailty bumper	1
relatively easy hang . we used additional glue pre-pasted paper because we read elsewhere it necessary . overall relatively good product	1
awesome item right size works great	1
my thoughts this product , i hope they help you decide . i already purchased britax car seat neutral color , thinking i'd happy . wrong ! so i return neutral color went floral pattern , which i love looking so my husband ! price more than i thought " next level " should cost , but well worth it . i spent good amount time store looking/feeling other car seats . this model very durable , good feel material , it going last !!! my only disappointment velcro tabs , which great idea hold straps side allow you place your child seat . velcro tabs located inch too high .	1

we purchased britax bodyguards our children when they first came out because they first booster provide side impact protection their heads , just like more current parkway model . i same complaints others first seats impeding kids ' views , but they quickly grew accustomed seats ( i loved their heads well-supported when they fell asleep long trips ) . last week , my daughter i car accident where we blindsided right . thanks those ' wings ' around her head , she doesn't seem suffered any injuries what serious collision . i bought new parkways each kids day after accident , i wouldn't want my kids ride any other booster seat	1
seat worked great . we bought seat because we could not stand way my 3 yearolds head would hang when she went sleep car . this seat offers support sleeping children . however same neck support prevents them looking side side ease ( kind like blinders )	1
i little worried when ordering this crib because several people said they problems shipping they said they never received product . i didnt any problems shipping . i received crib withing number day stated when i ordered ( 7-14 days ) . we no trouble putting crib together . i would suggest two people put it together just because it easier if one person hold parts crib while other person screws it together . it looks very nice . i no complaints .	1
my baby boy hates eat . 7 months old , he only taking most 4 oz milk per feeding . we tried all kinds nipples bottles . i picked up these bottles right when i got home , he ate 8 oz . one feeding . since then , he still doesn't like eat , but least we get some milk his little belly .	1
my son born nine weeks early trouble when nicu started bottle feeding him . hospital bottles either fed too fast or required too much sucking him . once we got him home we bought every bottle we could find try . dr. brown third one we tried it worked fantastic him . nipples fed him slow but not require too much effort him . once we started him this bottle , he started eating exactly he should not problem since . we also use nutramigen formula which also helped gas reflux , but us it nipple ease use him . downside us they don't fit well our dishwasher so we hand wash all them . when we go out we put dry formula each bottle carry bottled water us . when we need mix bottle we take out inside pieces , put cap screw neck nipple back , shake it well replace inside we no problem shaking - just take out inside piece .	1
my monitor excellent others reviewed , but careful ceiling fans ! when my fan sensor detecting movement when it shouldn't ( baby not crib ) . if you fan movement detection inaccurate . sure test this under all circumstances ( when you something room vibrates/moves , etc ... )	1

i ordered essentials bag after struggling bulky regular diaper bag my newborn . essentials bag fits blanket laying baby change , new outfit , least two diapers , wipes case , three 6 oz . bottles , formula dispenser , my wallet , keys , pacifer , burp cloth , cell phone . everything it ones compartment , which makes finding everything easy , no digging around middle big bag , due design it feels much lighter than larger bag . i not issues seams coming apart either . i also recommend bundle me , jj cole , it makes winter travel babies so much easier than snow suit	1
size shape , this bag holds more than you would think ! i also love your hands free when you wear it your cell phone easily accessible . we bought it our first plane trip our 3 month old used it back home more than our other bags . my only complaint there isn't pocket big enough hold fold-up changing pad ... but i fit disposable ones	1
overall , i've very impressed so far this nursery collection . specifically , i like quality quilting work -- which , honest , i wasn't expecting after just viewing web picture . since we live warm climate , i decided use comforter wall hanging above crib . it looks very lovely , brightens up room , shows off all embroidery comforter . anyway ... whether you use this quilt blanket or art , i think you get your money worth	1

... i plowed relentlessly thru virtually all cards original set . we even considered making our own playing cards , so satisfying game . so we all thrilled discover there electronic version . ' catch phrase'is fast paced , easy learn play , game setup , discrete categories , while not my personal liking , offers bit variation . only glytch scoring feature , which not allow mistakes , but this small quirk . ..	1
i quite skeptical when this small strap arrived mail because it looked so simple . but it worked very well real life-saver . it affordable easy use . i recently traveled alone my 13-month old didn't want bring my stroller . i simply used traveling toddler attach our britax marathon car seat my carry-on suitcase . it allowed me " wheel " my son through airport myself , while carrying all stuff i needed carry . i backpack diaper bag , i good go ! so simple i even hand free . i couldn't believe it . flight attendant helped seat once i plane . only drawback going through security un-do then re-do everything . but once you straps adjusted right tightness , it easy put back without readjust straps .	1
we purchased this travel over summer it great ! i researched many options , not only this most economical , it easiest most efficient . it very easy quick use very small store when not use . plus , my daughter loved it because it allowed her travel her own seat where she very comfortable . not only we love it , i three different people stop me dfw denver international airports asking where i got it because they wanted one too	1
this carseat absolute best . i purchased this seat when my daughter outgrew her infant seat my only regret i didn't buy this seat very beginning . it comfortable easy use . i looked other britax models but didn't find those easy use . yourself favor invest this seat	1
after searching just right seat , i'm happy say i love this one . instalition so easy . i acura i afraid it wouldn't fit well into car rear facing , but it fits very well . room spare . i would highly recomend this seat .	1
i really like suction bowls . different sizes lids great . my only complaint bowls often come un stuck so every few minutes you reach over push them back down	1
after potty seat you take off toilet , we finally tried this potty pal seat . my almost 4yr old daughter easily take proper seat down go bathroom . childs adult seat light not come slamming down . they all fit seat cover nicely not akward adult use . highly recommend wish i would bought this after she outgrew stand alone potty seat	1

this entertained my daughter 2 hours day . make sure buy extra hanging toys . it comes 3 hanging toys . musical toy , bell ringing mirror rattler your childs starter kit . it my daughter reaching rolling first time plus focusing great . colors characters her talking kissing them	1
gymini wonderful ! i used it since day i brought my son home hospital . it helps baby develop focus tracking skills increases alertness first couple months . it then helps hand eye coordination . you dangle assortment toys arches . we never purchased any extra ones you get because i'd just add some his other toys clip-ons you'd use stroller . it hard find educational toy newborn interactive well last ! this fits bill . you lie floor talk them what they looking .. sometimes my baby just happy his playtime play independantly 20-30 minutes . it portable . we folded it up taken it suitcase us 5 times now ! because it so lightweight folds up easily it great travelling . then you set it up your hotel room or grandma house baby familiar environment play which gives you some hands free time baby some fun well . it amazed me how much older children play it ! thanksgiving christmas grandma all nieces/nephews ages 4 14 playing it their own baby . now 4 months i think my son gets little bored it because he likes sitting up . yet he still play it good 15 minutes ( it may not seem like much but trust me this , if you want enjoy nice cup coffee/tea morning while it still hot this good thing ! ) . i tend rotate his toys now so i think this still bring entertainment up year . toddlers we over like crawl under arches past dangling toys ..	1
my 2 year old loved this cup , before he wouldnt drink out sippee cup only prober glass but would alway spill it . this cup so bright he cant help but look items tell me whos it , it helps also bright i never lose it . i hope this cup last over used his brother . wide top makes it feel different than reg cup . i am buying more oif these	1
started using when he 5.5 mos sitting help . wrap-around-belt secures baby even helped him sit up cart kept him secure sliding or tilting ! now it even more useful 7 mos he reaches everything . wide strap really holds baby secure keeps them leaning over grabbing things . i hook toys strap ' links ' his pacifier clip he good-to-go even hour+ store . i liked look " other " kind covers whole basket - but this one less bulky wide strap keeping him where i want him ! update 1yr age : i ended up buying one other types cart-protectors . other one great until few months ago , when baby just can't kept still cart leans or pulls feet up . so other kind became easier he never hits his head any part cart also it used restaurant high-chairs	1
this our third baby monitor . we bought this one backup grandma house we ended up liking it so much better than ones we bought double ( quadruple ) price ! night light wonderful sound good .	1
i've using this pump every day 4 months , i'm absolutely satisfied it . since my son premature i pump exclusively beginning , i say without reservation this pump works just well , quickly , hospital pump . it empties my breasts 10 minutes , it easy , it travels well . also certain bras ( not medela bras , they seem require some type adapter ) you pump hands free simply hooking/securing nursing bra cups over breast pump cups . one last comment i make which speaks quality , i ordered extra membranes tubing available " just case , " but yet need them original ones still operational . i - - recommend this pump all nursing moms , if you think this one expensive , consider two things : 1 . value your time convenience , 2 . total cost after you end up replacing cheaper one when you find it doesn't really meet your expectations or breaks down	1
i bought gerber comforthold bottles playtex ventair natural shape bottles , there stage ones . my son didnt like gerber nipples since nipples too short he hardly get any thing . i end up buying more playtex bottles threw away gerber nipples use playtex nipples gerber bottles well since they fit gerber bottles . thing i like these bottles , obviously he got less air after feeding him i didnt burp him like i used other bottles . shape bottles easy hold me my baby well . no leaks recommended !!!	1
calvin tried 6 other bottle systems - including dr. browns , drop-ins latex nipple only one he accepted . introducing bottle tough breast-fed babies , this one seemed more natural than others . i can't stop bzzing how good they . hope this helps you your bottle selection , amyco	1
wonderful bottle breast or bottle fed babies . my first daughter likes these bottled fed only . my second daughter only liked these , if it wasn't mommy ( if ya know what i mean ) . you find generic liners work fit just well , cut back cost . bonus there less clean up . just wash nipple nipple ring your ready go you next feeding	1
my son little so it may not good larger kids starting potty train . he 27 pounds age 21 months . get some those disinfectant wipes clean it out each time you're good . ( wear gloves wash your hands after too . ) fits small space my small bathroom without issue	1
i love this little potty car trips . my 3 year old petrified automatic flushing toilets so we bought this chair use recent vacation . she loves it . it really easy clean . i just keep some clorox wipes car seat . it now lives back my minivan incase emergency potty stop . we also using second one train our 23 month old son . splash guard great he very comfortable seat	1
i think overall this booster great . it lightweight large enough accommodate children they grow . my 3 year old son ( 30lbs ) looks kind tiny inside seat he slouch seat , but seatbelt position good height small children . this seat would well child who easily goes remains seat ... but not child who likes climb out their seat	1
these wonderful ! my baby getting uncomfortable swaddled three months , so we decided make switch sleep sacks . we worried her arms free she might hard time falling and/or staying asleep . this true first so we started only putting her these during daytime - light cotton one . after week she not waking early her naps anymore after two weeks we tried her it night - she slept straight through night ( she when she swaddled ) . so transition painless she seemed much happier baby able reach her hands move her arms . while i didn't notice shrinkage i notice zipper bunch up bit , but this hasn't problem . sometimes my daughter sucks it if it gets close her mouth , but she reach it - it doesn't cover her face all or trap air she could rebreathe . i didn't like these don't sleeves so i tried carter sleep sacks found sleeves too short hard get my daughter . those sacks only come one size which my daughter already outgrown four months ( 14 lbs , 24 inches ) . she also outgrown small size sleep sack , but medium size fits her perfectly some room grow . i didn't want use fleece first since it polyester . i wanted use cotton . but we've found she sleeps longer seems prefer he heavier fabric fleece one . also , we only bought these blue even though we girl because color calming our easily overstimulated baby . we've washed these many times they look just good hold together just well they originally . we've also found you put your baby into next larger size without it so big they get their arms out or it bunches up around their face . so after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks day one	1
no probs this picking up neighbors or interfering our existing fp 900 mhz monitor our 2 1/2 year old . we trash safety first cheaper one invest this , but it worth it we really like it . it clear , we also like it comes two receivers . much easier , even our smaller home .	1

i love this little pouch . what great idea rather than going though your whole diaper bag looking pacifier . great thing this pacifier pod feel this little bad ( since it connected outside diaper bag ) you tell if you pacifier it so you don't leave home without one end up needing buy	1
gummie rail guard good investment . my daughters crib larger sides which regular crib guards wouldn't fit . gummie guards fit any size . only problem i found tape which holds them isn't tacky enough . don't get me wrong ... they work but my daughter found edge started lifting off crib . i some left over put new piece she hasn't bothered it . maybe i didn't put it correctly first time ? gummie saved my daughter crib her teeth	1
i bought this system after experiencing frustration other wireless monitors . some reason this unit worked well even though i wireless computer network portable phone . flexibility excellent since both monitor cameras work re-chargeable power pack , batteries ( monitor ) or ac power ( camera . ) because it worked so well we decided import resell them .	1
i am really impressed potty protectors . first all , they came quite quickly . secondly , size pretty generous , so it fits larger toilets . i feel better my little one using public toilets now .	1
we bought this mattress my daughter 3 years ago when she 6 months old , it now her toddler bed ! it survived uncountable jumping sessions so easy clean - literally just soapy spongeing job . it finally got tiny split vinyl cover , but i put two inch piece duct tape over it , put sheet it back business ! when we replace it , we'll just get pediatric 1000 . excellent value	1

i think i practically wore this every day first 6 months my child life . it awesome ! it great sit up bed feed because it gives you back support . child feels very supported well . cover very easy wash . i used it photo prop well help her sit up when she older . my only complaint i not invent it	1

i like this seat ! it last till my son out car seat . it hard buckle ( cars seat belt)with boster seat still attached , but when you take it off it works just like all others . i no complant except it hard buckle car cars seat belts . i haven't tried teather system	1
i love this stroller ! i bought cheaper umbrella stroller it not near stroller this . handles comfortable height my son sits comfortably stroller . basket perfect diaper bag couple shopping bags . i highly recommend this stroller . it great investment worth money	1
angle rear wheels handles make walking comfortable if you're taller parent ( unlike really cheap umbrella strollers ) . it folds up very small , so it easy throw floor back seat if you don't trunk space available . it also nice carrying strap so you throw it over your shoulder like gym bag , which nice when i walked my office day care several blocks away . i always recommend this my friends ease use good value	1
my first breastfed baby these my salvation . it helped relieve soreness while breast bra . it keeps sore nipple suspended midair off rubbing your bra . it also helps nipple stick out little , which i found made attachment ( baby mouth nipple)easier first time breast-feeder . you need check shield now then dump out any milk ( or some may save it ) . only way i see product could improve area , would bottle size attachment your boob whom us would really want walk around ? there holes top shield allow air circulation . me esp . night i would put nursing pad over holes so it would help soak up any leakage . but far this product worth it . i'm due soon baby #2 am back buy more . i gave mine mom friend who ready give up breastfeeding her very hungry son who ate all time her breasts unbearably sore . she swears these shields reason she didn't give up extremely grateful . definitely worth try	1
okay , so canopy . well it touching my sons head , however there natural bend metal holds canopy up ( slides through canopy like curtain rod)(where it connects stroller)and i took it out put it though other way my son like 2 inches his head canopy . other people or this problem , this easy fix . i hope some people who already left reveiws come back read this . i give it 4 stars now instead 3 my other reveiw . my other reveiw labeled kamarina	1
this great product tight fitting lids . it also dishwasher safe microwaveable . this vendor also ships apo addresses - thank you .	1

i 19 month old daughter one due august , so i look out double stroller i actually liked . when we saw quattro duo we couldn't wait it come out . we waited it hit shelves which not happen around here yet . so we nervously ordered it online without test drive . our nerves settled when we recieved it other day . yes it heavy , but i manage fine . it longer than picture but if it any shorter you could not fit 2 children it . this stroller too many nice features dwell small negatives . best part besides easy fold down it fits easily room into my car ( i mazda 6 ) . this big worry , but not anymore . i love this stroller very happy purchase	1
after receiving no help babies us trying order this , we decided go ahead purchase this without even touching it . it made me nervous , but after reading everyone reviews , i figured , lets give it shot . wow , love this stroller ! i am still working putting infant seat out , but far menoovering this , it great . i son who almost 3 loved it so much he wanted pushed his bedroom it , this thing went around corners no problems without even bumping walls . now , i know purpose not use it house , but after reading review this hard steer i make sure i put this comment here . this stroller so much more attractive than old duo gliders ' , i feel like hip mom	1
i received my graco quattro tour stroller last week after waiting over month it released . it so worth wait ! this stroller so easy steer both kids plenty leg room ! there large storage basket underneath plenty cupholders . it pushes like dream , even my 2 boys who over 30 lbs each ! i owned duo gliders past they so much bulkier than this so hard steer . i highly recommend this stroller . note , i very pleased service i received amazon.com!	1

we swaddled our daughter until she 6 months old . this blanket not work very small babies , but we started using it around 2 months . it wonderful . only problem we it when our daughter strong enough , she could break out it . point we switched miracle blanket ( which really works like straight jacket .. there no escaping ) . our daughter now seven months old sleeps unswaddled . she slept through night ( 12 hours ) since two months age , i really believe she such good sleeper because swaddling	1
lost neice sids , i very nervous my baby would stop breathing night . this co-sleeper got me through first 5 months because i could reach over check her breathing any time during night . i could sleep or nap right next her without fear rolling her . she would not sleep it until she 3 weeks old , but after , she just fine . i would definitely use it again if i more children	1
my daughters preemies so i very concerned spaces crib . this product worked very well so far i'm happy i purchased it .	1
after waking serious screaming nursery find her six month old caught her leg crib rails my daughter i searched solution problem . thanks reviews other parents who experienced similar problems we found crib shield system . it works perfectly . although baby emma tries she not repeat entanglement . so now she bigger better things . crib shield system would make great gift exspecting parents . one less thing worry . one you probably never even though ; but baby	1
swaddleme awesome product if your baby enjoys swaddled . our baby slept best when swaddled , but could often work his arms out blankets we swaddled him . we found he stayed swaddled longer , thus slept longer , when he his swaddleme . i gave my sister one when she baby , she loved it so much , she ordered two more . i couldn't find local store sold large ( when he outgrew small one ) , thus ordered it amazon .	1
advanced pump works just well symphony pump we used hospital . i would definitely recommend this product . it very helpful	1
i like convenience able carry this pump me i like it comes pump/freeze/serve bottles separate carrying case cooler block . plus , bag good-looking you wouldn't even know it breast pump . pump itself works well . what i not thrilled bottles didn't come nipples medela nipples not easy find their own . i buy separate pump store starter kit ( 4 bottles , caps , nipples ) get decent supply . also , pump little louder than i thought it would but if you zip pump compartment while you're pumping , it cut down noise . thing i expected there different speeds pumping like there ameda hospital pump i rented couple weeks but even $319 , it only one speed ( although you adjust vacuum strength ) . last , this isn't directed specifically this pump but all pumps pump both breasts simultaneously ... i don't think they're worth it . i don't really even pump both breasts same time anymore because it not easy sit there holding both cups over both breasts top adjusting dials possibly holding or trying soothe baby . i constantly broke suction seals dripped milk my lap . i spent so much time readjusting cups trying get comfortable i could just pumped one breast time ( which i now ) . fortunately , medela pump works pretty fast magic me .	1
i using my brest friend pillow three months i love it ! it so secure never slips or slides like boppy pillow or traditional pillows . cover comes off machine washed , but hang dry , which annoying , but still not enough me take star away . mbf also nice firm , which i find big advantage over boppy . i cannot recommend this pillow enough-i buying it all my friends who plan breast feed	1
going lugging around heavy infant carrier convenience pulling this out car pushing down lever bring out wheels glorious transition . it not best carseat out there , tad inconvenient some areas , but ease converting it stroller taking my little girl into stores it , far outweigh other annoyances . one thing i say - when carseat rear-facing position , it tilt forward bit my liking . when my girl falls asleep her head usually hanging forward because forward slan t.t he seatbelt go over top seat , so you reattach everything every time you put your baby into it get little annoying . stroller part great though . it so easy adjust tightness straps . despite small wheels , it actually very smooth ride concrete bumpy parking lots . much smoother then any shopping cart her carseat it , ever - lol . i got this gift my mom didn't think i'd like it , but i really love it now .	1
i must say this really good car seat/stroller . we needed it long trip europe oklahoma . it made it sooo much easier . then when we got states it great ride airport then other cars we use . we waiting our other car seats when began love it even more . we able go car mall , church , movie , store what ever ease . only thing we didn't like it didn't umbrella or something protect shade it isn't suitable rough areas like gravel or large brick areas . it tends move funny around those kinds areas other than it great	1
this stroller worth every penny . pivot wheel fantastic . i friends their jog stollers stationary wheel they struggle turn it when we're out walks . this one so smooth manuverable . i think best feature sunshade . it so much bigger than all other strollers . it really great job keeping sun off my baby skin . 2 wishes : i wish it tray baby keep cheerios sippy cup i wish it reclined more	1
i purchased this my daughter when she out grew her baby tub . i didn't like plastic rings because if she fell back she would get hurt . this very soft ring . it definately kids sit up their own . i other friends use this they loved it enough they also purchased one . it also comes nice hanger hang it towel bar bath tub -- i didn't find it too heavy hang	1
this thing awesome . we even took it restaurant us before my child could sit up his own . we didn't want leave him car seat hour because ( 1)he would get restless ( 2 ) babies get flat spots backs their heads frequent pressures car seats/swings . bumbo allows you sit your child ( if they unable or unstable sitting their own ) front you so you face them interact them without support them . we took our child baby class all babies one these . it really helped free up parents ' hands so they could play children versus holding them up . someone really thinking when they made this product . get it . don't think twice . you won't regret it .	1
this our first baby monitor , so i can't compare it against others , but we love it . it very quiet ( when baby asleep ) . there very little static or interference . we haven't ever picked up any other conversation . i haven't able figure out what frequency broadcasts . box instructions never say . some others mentioned , led ( lights ) indicators nice . if i'm shower i watch monitor see if baby making noise even if i can't hear it . also , we no problem reception anywhere house . our house 2500 sq . ft one story just comparison	1
we don't large bedroom , so mini works great ! i love our baby right next us , i'm right there if he needs me , i feel quite secure using it . it also quite small which makes easy travel when we go overnight trip somewhere . it definately worth it	1
my baby small ( 4 pounds 14 ounces ) when born not able nurse well . i established my supply rental symphony hospital . when it came time return symphony i debated whether continue renting it or purchase my own pump . purchase price pumps really scared me off , but i considered swing because it intended daily use , which what i needed , but not pricey pump style . i love swing . swing efficient , if not more , symphony . fact it single pump not bother me all because it so efficient i am pumping 20 minutes - both sides . it so lightweight portable you go anywhere . after month tied huge symphony every three hours , it wonderful welcome change able go places pump . i am full time working mom currently use swing every day . i fully recommend this	1
ok ... so i've told symphony cadillac breast pumps ... but price tag $[ ... ] who afford ?? renting it cost $[ ... ] month if you find place rent it .. i used it month .. i honestly not totally impressed price . then i read up swing this pump also ( like symphony ) includes medela 2-phase expression technology - new standard unsurpassed naturalness , comfort efficiency . after buying it .. i liked it better then symphony . infact i think it works just exact same , which crazy medela when price so different . i tried medela pump style well avant isis this one best . i would highly reccommend this pump . positives : this pump portable . comes travel bag , runs batteries or you plug it . pump itself size hardees hamburger . breast shield soft very effective , you control speed it letdown mode well automatically turns after few minutes . breast shield soft comfortable , suction speed same symphony , pump simple use , four buttons-you can't not figure it out easily ! it fast emptys your breast totally . negatives : ( i stretch this one cause i love pump ) it not quiet , i don't know why other review says it .. it actually louder then i thought it should .. but not louder then medela pump style or symphony . but just not " quiet " i don't want you thinking you going get something you pump front mini van noone back going hear .. it single pump ... i know .. duh .. but it negative , if only they made double this size base , i'm almost tempted buy . i highly reccommend this pump , mom three , i've tried lot pumps .. i think medela selling this pump short saying it like pump style , i think it comparable symphony !	1
i use my avent isis manual breastpump 3-5 times day it works pretty well , but white valve " star " got worn out after 2 months use . when buying this pump make sure you buy extra white valves " stars " spare parts , they not expensive , its 1.25 british sterling pounds per piece . make sure you buy 10 if you planning using this pump year or more	1
unlike some cheaper plastic stools , this one hold mom or dad ! it may not look like much online , but when you see feel it person , you realize it really much nicer than $5 stools you find discount stores	1
no more dirty tables my 11-month old eat off . it keeps her food table even piece catches food not end up her mouth . suction cups help hold it plac	1
this sleepsack perfect . i little skeptical , didn't know whether buy cotton one or this one . i am very happy quilted one . it fairly light cotton fabric , quilting stitched into it . it extremely soft seems awesome quality . after washing , it holds up wonderfully . my daughter not arrived yet , but expected any day now . i feel good putting her sleep this blanket help keep sids epidemic down .	1
i 2 change pad covers . this munchkin . it world difference so soft fluffy this cover . though we washing this cover every other week ( my baby 3 mo old now ) , it still feels looks like new .	1
this thing great . we use it safely co-sleep ( you safely co-sleep ; why most doctors this country refuse even discuss it when it reduces risk sids beyond me ) . it works so well , you just pull baby down little pad she sleeps , nurse her till she falls asleep lying down , then pull pad back up into sleep nest , without waking her . so helpful !! i really recommend this those thinking co-sleeping . it definitely safer alternative than adult mattress/pillows/blankets . we put it us sides keep pillows getting near her face- perfect .	1
excellent shopping experience all aspects . great item excellentshipping . very pleased . thanks	1

i lived cold climates each my kids , hated dreaded bundle up squeeze into carseat routine . it makes traveling so much easier now i leave baby without big bunting know she'll warm cozy . zippers great - almost 6 months use every single day not problem . i washed it several times it looks like new held up wonderfully . i used it windy days , when i bit sceptical it windproof , it stood test . moving it carseat stroller sinch velcro closures back . i don't any cons list this such great item us	1
we ordered this crib on-line babies " " us/amazon we like it lot ! not only it arrived one week earlier than estimated arrival time but it also came very good condition . i read reviews before we ordered crib realized we taking risk quite few customers complaining problems trasportation or serious damages due poor packaging . our crib arrived almost perfect condition . only reason i not give it 5 star rating because one piece we're going need when we convert toddler bed chip it ; it not too bad though . also , assembling crib not problem all my husband one our friends . following instructions , they able assemble 1 1/2 hour . i said before , we're very satisfied our selection , now we're just waiting our baby girl ( due march 21 , 2006 ) see how she likes it .	1
i purchased several diaper bags received several my shower . person who loves pocketbooks , i'm horribly picky any bag . but diaper bag especially should functional stylish . combi urban sling just . time this writing , i've only it week , so i can't speak it durability . what you can't see pictures this site many pockets bag . front flap closes messenger-style via velcro . there zipped pocket which spans width front flap inside front flap . upon opening front flap velcro , there two pen holders two compartments/pockets which fit wallet , or checkbook or even diapers if that where you want put them . there zipped compartment side bag which holds one bottle . this only drawback ; only one bottle go insulated compartment . however , part bag which deepest , there two deep compartments one zippered compartment top spacious inside . bottle thing remedied me putting bottle inside compartment ziploc bag ( keep temperature ) . shoulder heavily padded middle bag , which joy my shoulders . key holding section convenient well . back bag compartment which holds large changing pad . this one best features changing pad itself isn't bulky taking up oo gobs diaper bag space . i took this bag hardest possible test site : suburban mall . this his first trip there i able pack two nine ounce bottles , wipes , diapers , change clothes , his medicines , disposable changing pads , receiving blankie ( albeit thin ) , my wallet essentials still pockets bag empty . rubberized shoulder pad i didn't worry bag falling off my shoulder it rubbed against my shirt . ( i know i'm not only one who sick readjusting bags their shoulder over over ) . way it designed , it leaned flat my hip instead jutting out . made turning those store corners stroller much less difficult . bag came super handy his doctor visit yesterday middle heavy rain . material seems waterproof . i really love this bag . i'm maternity leave now , i am using it strictly baby . however , someone who works social services often meetings field neighborhoods , i see using this bag transitioning work upon my return . if it holds up , it also seems perfect bag those theme park trips . overall it money well spent .	1
i purchased twilight turtle christmas gift my 27 month old grandson he says " i like it ! " . he asks it every single night bedtime . his favorite color amber , which almost impossible see , but he likes hold turtle aim stars his pj wall behind his bed - so it works him . while he not use toy it meant used ( sitting dresser so ceiling/wall illuminated ) prefers hold onto turtle aim it like flashlight , he really enjoys it , that whole point !	1
my 2 year old loves this turtle ! i can't wait show her constellations ! only thing i not like amber colored bulb ... stars aren't quite bright enough	1
i bought this video monitor system right after we moved into new house when my son ( autism ) 4 . because his bedroom different floor , i repeatedly going check him night make sure he okay still his room ! i mounted camera widest possible angle -- near ceiling corner his room -- now i check him all night long . ( i leave volume very low , so i hear if he yells , but he doesn't wake me up if he just playing or drawing . ) parents autistic kids know , our little ones often very clever escape artists , so reassurance this monitor offers fabulous .	1
i've used these two babies now used milk after 6mo deep freeze . they great most time . i freeze 10-12oz each bag ( yes , they say no more than 6oz , it myth ) . 12 maximum i found tho . trick make sure there no air . it won't leak b/c bag expand , unlike plastic storage containers . i use straight edge table , push milk all way top zip it i push air out . don't worry if little leaks out b/c it double zipper . then i freeze it flat surface singly . after it frozen , i put 8-10 these big gallon zip lock bag date outside put it deep freezer . it easier organize them this way deep freeze . bad thing these bags once frozen , plastic nicks easily if you drop it , scrape it against something , etc ( all frozen containers ) . lansinoh really bad problem leakage before but they've improved . just thaw bag container case it leaks . lansinoh customer service great replace them if you encounter leaky bags	1

great ! sounds perfect , my baby loves them all especially whales . i love fact it volume dial two choices time . small enough pack bring you anywhere . highly recommend	1
my experience , using bib without pocket pretty useless . my daughter always makes big mess when eating pocket mandatory . i love this one because it soft enough comfortable pocket actually firm enough large enough what it needs . i love entire thing hard plastic , without any fabric -- all you wipe go . no staining or mildewing or anything like . we 2 , one use one spare that all we need . mechanism clasping very easy hook unhook ( mom or dad ) , but secure enough your little one won't easily pull it off . it also adjustable little necks bigger necks alike . we've used several types pocketed bibs past , but now we've found this one we never need kind . my opinion , this perfect bib messy little eaters	1
always where it needs , durable , easy clean . my daughter used it part five-tiered food buffering system : plate , tray , bib , hands , cheeks , all which seemed vital somehow . if anything , she probably liked it better than we , we liked it lot . it always bit letdown get out somewhere realize we only one terry or soft vinyl kind	1
my first son took breastfeeding like champ get-go . i never experienced sore nipples him . my second son whole different story though . some reason my second son just didn't want open his mouth wide enough get good latch , so made excruciatingly sore nipples me first two weeks nursing . it torture - pure torture . nurse hospital gave me these gel patches help my sore nipples i must say , i don't know what i would out them ( i probably would given up breastfeeding ) . i tried nipple cream help bit , but these gel patches really what made breastfeeding manageable me . i healed faster wearing them than i nipple cream . if you put patches fridge couple minutes then put them they feel really great . this wonderful product i attribute them getting over huge breastfeeding hurtle first two weeks .	1
this baby monitor working very well us . i looked long time imho simple features ) three units - 1 each mom , baby dadb ) ability talk each them . connection good , very faint noise , if you crank up volume . downsides : little annoying loud beep you hear before speaking . rechargable battery ( two parents units ) don't hold very long . after couple months use , we recharge them now every three days - we use them 4 hours day . baby unit no battery , but i don't think that problem . still , best monitor i could find :	1
this seat so easy put together , place vehicle strap child , it definitely worth every penny . safety ratings this seat great . it also convenient , when child old enough move booster without backrest , backrest removable . our daughter loves cupholders snacks drinks . she also loves she climb out seat herself , which good her self-confidence she grows up . we use this seat 2 cars it easily removed replaced simple slide seat belt . seat even color-coded show where belt should placed across shoulder waist . definitely great product	1
we could not asked better high chair than this one . we small house not lot room kitchen area so this perfect us . it attaches great one our kitchen table chairs . i love fact it reclines too . my son hold his own bottle so i recline him after he eats his food then give him his bottle while i get things . i totally recommend this high chair everyone .	1
this excellent lightweight stroller one we use most often . we more expensive , larger , " safer " stroller more features , but we found we never use it always use this one . collapsing stroller pop into car breeze , there adequate shoulder strap you carry stroller when you doing portage over rough ground . we take stroller everywhere . we've used it well-groomed trails hiking , museums , restaurants , we've even used it beach , we've used it paris metro . this great stroller train subway travel . wheels lock feature which allows them rotate , or swivel , rear wheels brake mechanism which little awkward release , but i find comforting rather than frustrating : i want solid brakes . there small basket back stroller baby bag , purse , few groceries , so this again excellent stroller when you just running out few things or going small picnic . if i apartment dweller city , this stroller i'd ge t.t he only bad feature : this not stroller you run ! don't even try . harness excellent , but takes time adjust it correctly so it not too snug nor too loose . this super lightweight stroller , but quality product excellent engineering design . it not like those flimsy twenty-dollar throwaways just maclaren name it : this real deal . we used it two kids , still works like new . we should get sales rep compensation , because no one really these paris all our friends saw ours got one too	1
they came very quickly what i expected . thank you seller	1

we bought this our daughter when she approximately 5 months old . she now 3 sleeping it every night since then . whenever she upset something she gets her lamby cuddles it until she feels better . we always take it trips us she hugs it car . it sewn eyes so we don't worry choking hazards . warning : when she very young my daughter got her fingers caught under twisted ribbon around lamb neck . we two back up fluffles cut ribbons off all them .	1
when my daughter born , i didn't know swaddling , it would take me hours get her sleep ! i would feed or rock her my arms until she falls asleep , then put her her crib ... she'd flail her arms , wake up cry , i start all over ! what nightmare ! then i figured out since her arms wake her , it would make sense wrap her something so she couldn't move them much ... so i started wrapping her regular receiving blankets . it worked ! it became much easier get her sleep . but then she wiggled out those receiving blankets wake up again . when she little over month old , somehow i came across swaddleme blankets internet immediately bought it . it worked like charm ! it so easy wrap my daughter it , it stayed put . my daughter started sleeping so much better ! i wish i found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me so many sleepless nights ! i consider this blanket one most important baby items you could buy . it should must new mother who wants get some sleep	1

this second car seat carrier we've owned but first one wheels . wheels make such difference when you're traveling kids ! both our car seats fit ( we took lighter two ) little extra room coats , toys , etc . bag held up well our first trip it easy use . i only wish it 4 wheels instead 2 , but you can't beat this one price	1
it worthy me purchase this item my daughter stay so clean while going shopping . :	1
this great shopping cart cover ! cost little more than other covers but definately worth extra money . it covers every part cart your baby touch . i am even able use it over restaurant high chairs ( not perfect fit - but covers everything ) . there little loops hook toys into front inside side pockets stash snacks or whatever ( i hide my wallet there while shopping sometimes ) . it bit large when folded ( big fit diaper bag if you more than few diapers it ) , but due nice soft durable fabric . it comes plastic carrying case handle ( i'm guessing it 12 " x8 " 2 " thick - i leave mine car ) . i just wish i would found this sooner - my daughter loves it too . would great gift baby shower	1

i'm not sure what other reviewer talking - we used this my daughter all fall , winter spring , her seatbelt laid just fine - there no difference all . it velcros around seatbelts , so i'm not sure what nurses talking . other than , this thing wonderful ! my daughter summer baby , so we usually just used receiving blankets . but we got this fall able use it all winter into spring . it kept her warm enough , even cold days . i would probably suggest getting heavier version newborns winter , but this worked great our older baby winter . there no need worry blankets or extra layers clothes or snowsuits . bundle me lite stays attached carseat , all you need zip it up , you're ready go ! it detaches very easily ( because it just velcro ) washed . it actually acted protective barrier carseat those " accidents . " we still washed carseat these situations , but it greatly minimized damage ! this fabulous " extra " carseat , we'll definitely using it again next baby	1
i bought one these my daughter . i it car seat when we left hospital . nurses made me take it out . they wouldn't let her leave hospital it . they said it wasn't safe use . they said it doesn't allow seatbelt straps lay properly over baby shoulders making it unsafe . i wish i would known this before i bought it .	1
i love this humidifier because it lasts long . my brother already through his 3rd humidifier 4 years while i've only this unit 4 years it more years ahead . also , i find volume low setting very soothing helps me fall asleep . i've read posts mention filters hard find . however , they very easy find . evenflo filter same exact filter holmes hwf62 filter which available many places since holmes still manufactures humidifiers which require this filter . i just purchased " colorcheck " holmes filter walmart i still original evenflo branded filter last year . i put them up each other they same exact dimensions . actually , i prefer colorcheck over original evenflo filter because i think it lasts longer before needing replacement . if you look bottom evenflo humidifier box , it say this humidifier manufactored holmes evenflo . therefore , it would only make sense holmes filter would compatible this unit	1

okay , day we arrived home hospital we put her this seat she slept hours , she loves this chair . downside this chair it cost 50+ dollars begin , then you replace batteries once week , 3 batteries ( which isn't cheap) ! we spent well over 15 dollars batteries 2 weeks we home , we only turn chair when she fussy , it doesn't run all time . but , if you afford run out get batteries every 4 days or so , this chair awesome . it very soft , she loves it . i am not sure what we would without it	1

i nurse my daughter , but she supplements formula takes pacifier too . lactation consultant suggested soothie products improve my daughter latch because long round nipple shape that more natural nursing babies . it too soon see if it made difference , but my daughter loves soothie bottles paci now ! it took weeks before she'd take mam over week before she'd successfully drink gerber bottle , but she took soothies instantly 5 mins or less prefered them products she'd using months ! they're so much easier her suck hold her mouth . price great too , 1/2 price same set avent products . my 2 complaints : 1 ) leaking bottles 2 ) pacifier looks weird doesn't attach pacifier keeper . leaking fixed getting part where rim bottle meets nipple wet create full seal . also , it helps " swirl " formula mix instead " shaking " it ... it takes bit longer , but you end up less mess less bubbles	1

i've owned this thermometer three years now , i still love it .... even though i ran out probe covers long time ago . my husband i both use it , it works great our 3 year old boy . ( beeping thermometer makes him giggle , even when he sick . ) far probe covers go , we've found it works just fine without them . we use rubbing alcohol clean off probe tip uses , just we always old-school mercury thermometers our parents when we growing up . yes , instruction book this ear thermometer says probe covers help ensure accuracy , but we haven't found problem . keep mind this thermometer only use babies over 6 months old because ear canals newborns aren't large enough accomodate ear thermometer . exceptionally accurate temperature measurements very important newborns ( so use different type thermometer - not ear thermometer ) , but usually all we really need older babies , children adults measure " normal " , " little above normal " , or " significantly above normal . " my opinion , if temperature over 101 , you ought calling your pediatrician anyway . if probe covers really matter you , pull out instruction manual read it . it specifies you use any brand probe covers recommends particular model number walgreens brand covers . my opinion , first years company very helpful regard probe covers - instruction manual not say " you must buy only our brand probe covers . " instead , they make it clear just any brand work ( long style similar ) even specify brand readily available particular national drugstore chain . factor significantly affect accuracy how you hold thermometer ear . instruction manual includes both descriptions diagrams show how hold child ( or adult ) ear insert probe tip . it very important you use right " ear-holding technique " . smaller babies , you pull back ear straight back hold it while inserting probe tip . but older children adults , you pull top ear up hold it while inserting probe tip . when i neglect hold ear proper position , i always get inaccurate results . ( i know fact my normal temperature not 95 degrees , but that what it reads if i hold my ear incorrectly . ) when i hold ear correct position ( depending age size person whose temperature i'm taking ) , i get very accurate results . my guess people who complained accuracy this thermometer not read instructions , because diagrams manual show you quite clearly how hold ear thermometer . also , some reviewers mentioned getting inaccurate results their young babies ( e.g. , 3 months old ) . remember - this thermometer not babies under 6 months . it not intended used newborns , so you shouldn't expect accurate results when you use it newborn . plus , i can't imagine trying stick probe tip into ear newborn . would hurt ! so , my bottom line this great thermometer , long you use it properly . , probe covers really aren't big deal . get well soon ! :	1
this product what it says it box , it warms up first couple wipes you use . it nice product	1
my daughter loves it .... bathing her now its pleasure her me too	1
i've using this bathseat 4 months now , since my daughter 6 months old . she loves able kick splash while sitting it . i originally this same type bathseat my son , minus little elbow rest , but when trying purchase same one 7 years later i see it no longer available . great thing other one when putting your child into it , front would rise up snap shut . safety 1st tubside bathseat , you slide your kid into it . also , very careful if you " climber " . my daughter loves try standing it . fortunately , elbow rest makes it secure , so there no fears seat tipping over , just your little standing monkey . you still remove your child order wash their little bottoms	1
it took me several weeks before i finally opted purchase decathlon rather than boulevard . i very interested extra side-impact protection only available boulevard model but concerned whether or not my large 41/2 month old son ( who 95th percentile length weight ) would need adjustable crotch strap positioning only offered decathlon . i am so glad i purchased decathlon ! it turns out my son indeed need crotch strap adjusted last slot ( he would sitting top buckle boulevard this point which would made it impossible buckle very uncomfortable him ) . if you're purchasing thin toddler rather than infant or chubby/big baby you might not worry . i love extra padding ( which removable , unlike pads boulevard ) soft cover ( which machine washable unlike boulevard ) . he seems very comfortable i know he safe . i know it doesn't offer much side-impact protection boulevard , but it offer some ( definitely much more than conventional car seat ) it made far exceed american safety standards . plus , if your baby placed middle back seat than offers some additional protection well . i also concerned size car seat whether or not it would fit comfortably , rear-facing , back my toyota avalon car . it . perfectly ! my husband 6'4 " doesn't move his seat up accomodate car seat back ( something i very concerned ) . i see out rear-view mirror no problem . it not block your view all . it very easy install , if so properly , doesn't budge . it little tough adjust straps when it installed rear-facing but not too difficult ... even if you take it out adjust straps it no-biggy because carseat takes only couple moments install easily it not like you'll adjust them daily basis or anything . i am very pleased my purchase highly recommend decathlon anyone looking safe , comfy attractive carseat take them chubby baby stage all way through toddler years . :o )	1

this terrific car seat if you plan keeping it one car . if , however , you frequently swap car seats your cars , or want car seat you bring when you travel airplane , this isn't it . i bought this seat when my 3rd child outgrew his infant seat . compared my previous one ( century ovation 1997 ) , this plusher harness straps really don't get all twisted up . but i'm still hauling old century car seat out every time we fly anywhere britax marathon just too big .	1
my son wearing halo sleep sack since day he came home hospital . winter baby it best thing world know he would warm not worry loose blankets . he began sleeping through night 7 weeks old . i think sleep sack gives him feeling security . he never able sleep without it . he now 30 months old still won't go sleep unless he his sleep sack . we friend ours who seamstress add additional material bottom because he became tall it . how much he loves his sleep sack . it far best thing i ever bought my son	1
like any parent , i concerned sids so sleepsack seemed like perfect alternative blankets . little i know , i would come love sleepsack it warming capabilities . after few months under their belt , babies get very squirmy middle night , so blankets useless ( dangerous ) . so i relied heavily sleepsacks keep my little guy warm , even after risk sids passed . they come fleece winter months cotton warmer months , they're generous size , so they not outgrown easily . i only wish i'd purchased them yellow or white , case my next baby opposite sex	1

i got this my 15 month old daughter , who within last month seems become very aware her bodily functions . she constantly taking her diaper off , so i figured it worth try even though she seems little young . so far , so good . she sat right up toilet this seat went pee-pee within 3 minutes . she very excited throw her used kandoo toilet flush . i clapped said , " yea ! " this seat great because it easily removable , handles little ones busy hands , splash guard when this little one gets little much momentum behind her pee-pee . i think this much better sanitary option than one those potty training units . why try separate little kid later when they start off right toilet ? , why possibly put yourself through hassle cleaning those things , gross	1

when i expecting my first child , daughter , i decided i going buy graco snugride infant carseat . when i my local babies us store i saw safeseat loved fact it weight limit 30 lbs 32 inches height . it bigger little heavier then snugride but i know my daughter safer rear-facing beyond her first birthday . good thing this carseat after she grows out it i won't buy convertible carseat because she go right into booster seat i already her weight range 20 100 lbs . i love this carseat it well worth extra $50 . only thing i didn't like fabric , it felt stiff that why i bought carseat stroller different pattern . i installed this carseat week before i her no problem . i highly recommend this carseat	1
my 3 year old ( 38 inches tall , 30 lbs ) needed new car seat since his younger brother need other convertables we ( alpha omega elite evenflo triumph ) . i oooodles research this boulevard seat looks very comfortable i liked height/weight limit . only my son hates it . issue crotch buckle . it not it anymore further back than others , it just it too short . there needs extra two inches strap beneath it , like practically every other carseat market . he grabs his crotch ( he doesn't wear diapers ) says " ouch " when i buckle it and/or refuses get seat without struggle . little pad thing they attached doesn't appear all much . i try this rear-facing see if my 8 month old ( 29 inches , 20 lbs ) any issue comfort he didn't appear too . it seemed fine him . latch straps , which shouldn't twisted attach , twisted order attach seat my minivan ( there only one way it fits ) . i'm not impressed probably use belt if we keep this carseat . also , something bugs me buckles snap into crotch buckle , only one them actually " snaps " , other doesn't give " it buckled " snap like its partner no matter what i . after all britax hype i've read , i really expected little better . i like lever adjustment alpha omega elite headreast versus knob this one . while this carseat looks cushy nice , i'm sure safety wise it top line , i think we're going sell it just get compass booster seat like i bought our husband car ( my son loves seat ) . we've never trouble getting my son ride carseat until i bought this one i can't wrestle 3 year old several times day into car seat . if you're buying this older child , you might want them try it out first see if they find it comfortable	1
