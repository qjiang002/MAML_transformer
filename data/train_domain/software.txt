easy language 16 only useful if you're already familiar language you wish learn . i've studying french months before buying this product found it helpful when i'm getting rusty . only problem it hard make out what said because sound not clear . recorded speakers also don't bother slow down give you chance understand or repeat what said . this good cause it like listening actual french speaker not robot , bad if you actually want learn how pronounce what said . it also go over basic french grammar but totally useless if you don't already know basic french grammar . i also tried use this learn japanese . unlike french , i'm not familiar japanese language all so trying use this product learn it became nightmare . if all you want learn how speak language it romanized version words phrases make it easier sound them out . unfortunately basic japanese grammar japanese alphabet all written japanese . instance , grammar section it past , present future " i am " it written english then beside it it written japanese . you can't click them it sound out you . japanese alphabet section all it japanese alphabet you click them sound them out but you really no clue what you sounding out . so it teaches you nothing reading language but test they want you take purely japanese . i want learn how read , write speak japanese so none this would problem if it actually taught you how read , write , speak japanese ! so my guess would you really familiar japanese ( not romanized(romanjj ) version ) already order use this product . because my experiences this product i would say get it only if you know languages you're interested use it refresher nothing more . since i am familiar french this product pretty helpful but if i used this starter language i probably would quit . i'm searching amazon better japanese books . so if you want actually learn language look books language tapes cd 	-1

this program average below average it abilities . said , just hope you don't need any roxio tech support . why ? because roxio support bites ! you cannot contact anyone online or email help ; whenever their dis-functional " web portal " [ web-based support ] system traps you endless loop . i needed couple simples updates pc not allowed internet . it used you could download roxio patches any pc internet access . then burn patch[s ] cd , or copy floppy/jumpdrive . then " sneakernet " patches pc needing them . no more . what happened today their webpage apparently trying download/patch roxio product directly my pc . [ ezcd5 doesn't exist my pc ] . instead simply letting me download it somewhere , like my hard drive , vs patchging it directly their webpage my pc , [ which won't work my case i'm not using roxio , nor it installed my pc ]; apparently morons roxio webpage coding make download/patch process stop/end proceed send customer back roxio initial patch download page . when you need patch , all these endless loops support gamesare enough get me looking different product/different company . if you want minimize human contact customers , fine . but let folks least download patches they need order keep their pc going . don't hand over your customer support system [ almost ] completely web server . ignorant arrangement works well when companies try save few pennies get rid phone receptionists customer service telephone calls . then they let customers wade through 100 layer deep voicemail system find answer simple problem . it just doesn't work . if company won't provide access patches , even after i logged into their website username password , [ so they know accessing their patches ] they don't offer any type ftp site download backup option , then i sure heck won't buying anymore their products . i see why roxio bought up cequadrat other companies . [ though i hate see such quality companies devoured like ] . when competitor better product , why fight improve your prodsuct quality/features , when you buy other company out . thank goodness nero not under roxio umbrella .	-1

i bought this upgrade because i thought it would let me share my contacts . it says so box , but it doesn't . it works just like old contacts which you can't share others except if you export it . no live sharing . why couldn't they make it so i could put file my server ? or secure site ? then all my office work off one contact list . 50% or more time business contacts can't found when you search contact . it like business contacts add doesn't work outlook . or you add contacts , save it , email saved email address then go find contact later it gone . also , lots times when you try send , email won't send , it stays outbox . repeatedly you open hit send button but it won't change send status . now , if you leave it outbox , sometimes fools program into letting you send other email . or sometimes you forward send .. geez , what waste money this upgrade . we won't using it any our other computers we haven't bought if new computers we ordered .	-1

office 97 pretty good product . programs powerful , decent interface ( maybe not good claris products early 1990s , but not bad ) , came ton features all one disc . office 98 release mac pretty much same thing . only thing really got annoying me office assistant ( paperclip ) but it easy enough turn off . office 2000 bit disappointment me . i felt improvements minimal ( aside bit more stability word -- anyone who ever used word 97 regular basis knows it prone crashing ) fact detracted ease use . one example clip gallery , which went one best organizers ever created becoming program wouldn't received decent reviews 1988 . powerpoint outline feature . i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space therefore made actual slide smaller . when you use smaller displays like i often this problem . menus , which hide some functions until you go bottom them , also annoyance . manual went nice thick book one half size . office 2003 continues making program uglier . now there many tasks crammed onto one little panel right screen . again , this eats into workspace . clip art system even more cumbersome , many clips online only now . help feature tries point too much online direction well . now some people may not complain , but what if you're using laptop middle country ? i feel program basically uglier version same thing first seen 1997 . fact , 1997 version more pleasant work almost powerful . my macs , i've switched keynote presentations pages some my word processing because new office versions platform similar . some templates also look very 1997 . apple programs updated regular basis , their templates look very modern . now i know microsoft adds some new ones now then , but they should consider redesigning many them -- such replacing overused arial times new roman fonts something little more classy . program bloated way too heavily . i run office 2000 comfortably 486 sub-1gb hard drive , but can't even get 2003 it . final gripe access not user friendly all . file maker better alternative , it easier use friendlier	-1
while microsoft tries very hard make office " think ahead me , " they almost always seem get it wrong . result package consistently annoys me . it true one turn off " helpful " hints otherwise customize programs so they less hindering , however bloated package nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody business . my opinion , office ' 97 excellent package , versions since then gone steadily downhill . many people , i use office work because i no choice . home i've good luck staroffice sun . while not perfect , staroffice read created files compatible microsoft office very consistently my experience , it whole lot less expensive . i am therefore hesitant recommend microsoft office professional edtition 2003 anyone except those who need most advanced functions excel and/or need use access database frequently .	-1

i bought software ( digital image suite 2006 ) before i bought my camera - ready process pictures i going take . big mistake . i bought canon 30d camera record my images raw format (* . cr2 ) . unfortunately , not all canon . cr2 raw files same . so , even though software says you edit . cr2 raw images , it depends which camera made image . here complaint number two -if you use microsoft customer service/technical support you routed india - they just give you answer vaguely related your problem . after emailing several times getting nowhere you find out you can't write their washington state headquarters unless you name someone address . so , basically , microsoft largest technical software company world worst customer service no american technical support . now , final complaint . there no link or method get updates or upgrades this program ! so , if i want use microsoft software package edit my photo images then i buy new software package - isn't wonderful .	-1

feeling more than bit fleeced mcafee overpriced " subscription " renewal every year , i decided give kaspersky try . installation went smoothly everything seemed fine 2 or 3 weeks . then one day my computer would not boot --- just stalled blank screen right after windows xp splash screen . when trying boot up safe mode , list drivers currently loading scrolled down screen . it stopped file called kl1 . sys hung there forever . little research work showed this kaspersky file . it may just coincidence my system suddenly went kaput shortly after installing new antivirus program , but i doubt it . attempts use recovery disk failed . trip local computer shop revealed data my hard drives ( which inscrutable raid 0 format ) could not recovered ( unless i wanted ship them recovery shop , nothing them worth much ) . so they're going reinstall windows , i'll reinstall shipload software when i finally get my computer back , , yes , i'll lose all data there . ( gee , good thing i backed up all kids ' photos --- well , most them . thanks , kaspersky ! )anyway , perhaps my attempts recovering os caused worst this . whatever case , i believe boot failure caused either kaspersky file corrupted or virus . who knows . kaspersky blame both scenarios . i know one thing : i am not going tempt fate loading this program my computer again . kaspersky yet respond my e-mail . i got automated " we received your e-mail " response , but nothing more , even though they state they usually respond within day or two . over week ago . if fact their software no way responsible my computer flaking out me , then i still not apologize one-star rating , given their horrible customer service . if you decide i'm insane or this just fluke , least yourself favor make decent boot disk yourself before installing this product . might mean difference losing data/spending $$$ just inconvenienced . don't expect much assistance kaspersky should things go wrong .	-1

after years e-filing fees included purchase price , it would more forthcoming turbotax put large sticker front their box alerting buyers price they pay e-filing each return . i lost value my entire state return - then some - through e-filing fees : $44.95 ( plus tax ) program , $16.95 ( plus tax ) each return e-filed ( i filed two ) little bonus fee company handles [ credit card ] transaction ( fee never quoted program i wait my credit card statement find out what ) . addition , anyone who chooses fees deducted his/her refund pay additional $30 . product what it says . but , cost , less-than-honest way which change occured ( it almost seemed deceitful - hence single star rating ) , i would preferred given my money my friendly neighborhood accountant . people expect change , even if they don't like it . but , suprises cost customers money never welcome drive customers away . surely marketing/advertising gurus think way alert customer significant change such this even put " positive " spin it .

many repetitions necessary order acquire second language or third , but monotony this program not keep your interest long , so boring offers not variety all . this program take away excitement learning language even most motivated individuals , not help acquire fluency because it not equip you tools construct language your own . it not contain essential grammar instruction , it error suppose same grammatical rules your language applied other languages ( french not translation english , or spanish , or any other language ) . grammar becomes essential especially when you trying construct correct structures your own ; this program claims help you learn " naturally " but leaves huge gaps neglecting grammar , culture , conversational structures , clear understanding , not natural ! adults translation necessary when trying internalize concepts , adults already understanding language equipped learn differently than children , sometimes even faster . i not believe " learning second language like child " accurate statement describe this program , children immersed culture , everything around them " real deal " , not repetitious pictures recordings . children receive verbal non-verbal input constantly , adults greater cognition than children . looking picture while you listen recoding might give you vague idea what it means , but there not accuracy . it very unlikely you internalize concept you not fully understand . rosetta stone approach might very effective when memorizing vocabulary simple sentences , but i could achieve same purchasing flash cards fraction cost this overrated , overpriced program .	-1

i little research after trying install this product found symantec no longer rated very well anti virus . one site states this consumer reports ( they towards bottom ratings ) . it become major bloatware its stability isn't what it used . maybe this why peter norton sold his interests bailed out . i am far novice , but this thing gave me fight whole way . so my saga . first , this product supposed windows xp 2000 pro . even box says this . but when i insert cd w2k pro machine all i got error box showing error icon ok button . real informative . going through back door i try install without going through cd autostart program . now i get box says it requires xp 32 bit . so leaves out 2 machines i bought this . so i go machine running xp . first one loads ok , but it says it incompatible my firewall ( zonealarm ) which i happen trust lot . then second machine it goes through install ( which takes 45 min ) then runs autoupdate hangs halfway through . i finally abort it after it sat there hour ( i hoping it just slow moment ) . rebooted program no longer running . starting it up myself resulted it failing load . now i'm stuck , it won't allow me uninstall nor reload it again . obtain removal tool their web site it promptly removed every symantec product machine . maybe this writing wall ? now i'm couple days into drama . meanwhile , first xp machine loaded fine automatic update guess what . it locked up half way through . now it not run removed same way . so i am now proud owner zonealarm internet suite . it cost less than nav ( both 5 user versions ) , loaded much faster . ten minutes i , where it hour into nav when things worked it loaded . i am taking this up symantec trying get refund . they keep it . i've less satisfied every upgrade this one finally broke camel back . maybe i'll try again someday if i come up new camel , but they don't grow well seattle . added 3-12-2007 : i also noted after removing nav things i could not explain before cured . instance , web site [ ... ] would not load many it pages correctly , they would show text coding instead html . now i am nav free , all pages this site load no problems . hmmmm ..	-1
i've tried loyal quickbooks pro user 5 years now first this company provided competent accounting product decent after you learned its idiosyncracies . but each year you forced update ($$$) or your tax tables not accurate , each year some capabilities lost you pay them restored ($$$) , each year program more expensive update ($$$) . i am not unreasonable business owner i don't mind paying good service , but intuit turned into unethical , money grubbing monster . they sunset disable your software every time you download update , forcing updates buying previously provided services ( payroll tax tables , e-mailing invoices , printing 1099 w2 ) . this especially true year end , becuase they know they you tax/year end crunch . now they even doing unauthorised billing new services ( last year they started charging quarterly fees tax tables -- this year they charge mandatoy $300 payroll update well $100 software update program itself . ) furthermore they charge your credit card without permission under ruberic its same quarterly tax table fee . honestly , consider some other program ! this deceptive practice software disabling data blocking , combined dubious practice sunsetting software every year grown intolerable . i hope they get class action suit they deserve .	-1

i owned spysweeper several years . i found large amount spyware not getting caught . many cases , ** portion ** spyware caught , spy sweeper not remove complete spywhere i kept getting hits . tried out xoftspy software it found removed all spyware . even more , i get constant e-mails webroot telling me my " subscription needs renewed . " i must send $25 renew . i got caught their scam once until i started checking my subsciption date . they frequently send out banket e-mails telling people their subscriptions up even though they may much year left . i contacted them several times this issue no response or correction . i am only keeping this software installed because i paid out bucks it . i would not recommend it others mainly because decptive business practices inability perform advertized . look elswhere	-1

i purchased this program recently , very disappointed . maps very limited ... example , most major tourist areas ( beaches , newport , ect . ) rhode island cut out ri map . i recommend buying ms streets trips 2005 ( which includes pocket streets 2005 box ) instead : http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/b0002doeam/qid=1121691049/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-6971135-7476654?v=glances=pcn=507846with this program , you entire usa your disposal , you select which maps send your pocket pc or smartphone . fortunatly , store sold me pocket streets allowed me exchange it streets trips ( after paying difference ) . prices very close .	-1

i'd give this product zero stars if i could . i use quickbooks online payment service version 2004 , last week it started telling me they discontinuing support version 2004 online service , so they forced me upgrade . so i bought upgrade , when i ran installer it wouldn't accept my serial number . i spent forty minutes phone tech support choppy line india , he still couldn't get it work . i finally gave up when next step he proposed disable all services running my computer . i heard others , including accountant , this version bad but couldn't believe it would really this bad . i'd used qb since early-1990s never really problem . but this really , really bad . intuit needs go back drawing board this version . it total lemon	-1
contrary advertising runs vista , what comes box may not run vista . upgrade now says you up date but it not ., however , you use product id download real vista version . beware product license says " software ... provided basis without warranty any kind ... " i major mess nuance product verification process . when product start run , it not correct . date i've charged two support incidents(maybe more billing hit my credit card later ) i've logged 3 hours phone within first two weeks well several emails . otherwise i like product but one should not hours grief pay pay get it running first time . i'll never nuance product .	-1

this maybe worst interface i ever displeasure working includes console applications dos interfaces . edlin fdisk more user friendly than mcafee security center . there noway disable software except uninstalling program or opening xp admin tools then forcing services stop , which not recommenable approach average user . here short list probelms i encountered . counter spy cheaper , easier use interface user friendly ! * cannot select disable during non-internet use so i run software security center conflicts like protools 7.3 recording software . * scan results vague , ie returns 6 quarantined threats but doesn't display what threats you can't print result either . * there more ...... there some good features but detractors win land slide .	-1
everyone else said , this product not all what it should . it slows down internet browsing crawl ( my laptop crashed several times , several years older runs wireless loads pages faster than my new computer mcafee ) . you can't close it , others said , other than uninstalling . funniest part i've found , however , it warns you first time it tries access . amused , i refused program permission update itself . other than removing program , it best thing i using mcafee	-1

adobe audition my favorite program . i use it more than any other program i my computer . i used it restore thousands old phonograph discs . i am only giving them one star because i can't give them no stars this joke . i knew this going happen . i using cool edit pro long time when adobe bought it i knew they going turn it into adobe product screw it all up . i am very fortunate i went adobes web site downloaded free trail version . i would really upset if i actually paid money this dog . lets start boot up time . i own 2 year old average laptop audition 1.5 used boot 2 seconds . 2.0 takes 20 seconds . almost long photoshop or premiere pro . next we user interface . they destroyed it . old one worked so well . adobe really hung up making absolutely everything " palette " so now every little thing palette , allowing you resize relocate them your hearts desire . but after half hour trying i'll darned if i could not make 2.0 interface remotely resemble 1.5 interface . shortcuts buttons removed ( wow makes lot sense ) , however you get it back if you look long enough place it . ( don't bother right-click anything , their imperial wisdom right-clicking now pretty useless . ) but if you put shortcuts back up they now all black white it really difficult find one you want . place shortcuts they added some icons i yet figure out or need . what they thinking ???? lot presets reconfigured trying figure them out gave me headache . after several hours playing this pile garbage i decided uninstall it return using 1.5 .	-1
this program terrible deal . i run small business bought quickbooks simple start . once loaded you go use program there pop up requiring you administrator . when loading software it not tell you select or bypass administrator requirement . you only learn this when you first go use program . url they give pop up troubleshooting not address this issue , either . you just locked out program . now it gets fun . so , you speak them help . but this where it gets no laughing matter . get help you email them ask help . they then call you back their convenience . if you busy working when they call back you start all over . i yet able use this product since i bought it 3 weeks ago because they not call back when it convenient me customer not let me call my covenience . even worse , since they bought out all their competitors quickbooks customer support no longer available after regular hours when small business owner time handle such operations issues . i can't return this product refund because i loaded it . my first clue how not user friendly this product should title : simple start	-1

if you not mediocre-level understanding chinese , stay away this product . rosetta stone very unique approach might work children under age seven ( critical language learning years ) , but every other beginner language software almost impossible use . object " game " match mandarin phrase ( said aloud written pinyin ) poor , pixellated photo . example , first section first lesson , you shown ball , airplane , elephant horse . phrase read you match it correct photo . it gets much too complicated after . basically , it pure guessing game most time . i gave this product serious evaluation even after reading plethora poor reviews . i thought unique style interesting enough give chance , but i feel though i wasted hours hours . i remember only two or three words entire experience . although i spent fewer hours pimsleur mandarin audio lessons , i am able recall many , many more words phrases . although pimsleur isn't perfect , it definitely best choice beginner ( solid chinese-english dictionary ) . if you not know well basics mandarin , this software completely useless . buy pimsleur instead	-1
their approach might work other languages , but chinese it critically important understand grammar language , which rosetta stone never explains . it simply displays four pictures you , some incomprehensible ( beginner ) chinese near them , you learn match incomprehensible words pictures . i've taken chinese two years , i still found it impossible learn anything it . i either knew words already , or i couldn't learn whatever it they trying teach . i would happy just videotaped lecture mandarin college course , but i can't find anything like this sale or free online	-1

i specifically bought turbo tax premier because stocks sales/purchases we made 2006 . section stock income confusing it took me several times figure out what information turbo tax wanted where . when i thought i it figured out finished section , i thought i would repeat it make sure i it right . my surprise , second time i entered information i received different total than first time . so i it third time . third time matched second , so i figured it must right . then when i got section error checking , i told i errors my stock sales . so i it forth time , which came out same second third time . this time it passed error checking , but instead showing we purchased stocks , turbo tax showed we " inherited " stocks . i could not get turbo tax change , so i printed out form scratched out " inherited " put date purchase . i would rather my taxes hand than use turbo tax again	-1
normally i might wait install new software upgrade , but i just got new laptop thought it would best use office 2007 new vista operating system . i wrong . you would expect multi-billion dollar company like microsoft could put out powerful bug-free piece software . but after month using office 2007 , you get distinct impression this software not ready public release . microsoft should ashamed . i don't know root cause my problems , but i stress i am running clean install office 2007 vista , so there shouldn't any software conflicts or issues . so what my issues ? list long : -- my biggest concern ms word constantly hangs stalls . it making editing document very painful . i suspect problem when i put images or visio diagrams into document . but something old ms word able without issue . oddly , if i colleague open document save it out word 2003 , problem goes away ! what ?! it killing my productivity . -- when ever i cut paste old document , word hangs 15 20 seconds . often formatting margins my new document go haywire . i keep spend ton time fixing things . this never happened old word . this time killer . -- every few days , outlook 2007 starts telling me it cannot display my email folders . uh oh ! i completely restart my computer see my email again . -- outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails people send -- they look like mess . it because outlook 2007 not render html correctly since it uses word engine , not internet explorer display email . i no idea why microsoft this , but they got fix it . -- many issues old word 2003 still haven't fixed . if you place image , it often hard get it appear correctly . why can't they solve this one ? -- while most office programs new ribbon interface ( which i like ) , some programs like visio 2007 not . so you remember how use two interfaces . couldn't microsoft find time money update all its programs ? give me break . -- few occassions visio 2007 , my files failed save correctly . first i thought this must my fault , but it happened me few times can't coincidence . few times i've gotten error message lost my work . ug . -- word excel 2007 use completely new file format . so anyone you send document 2007 installed ( which isn't likely case ) . get around this , you save it down 2003 file format , but then you end up two files your hard drive -- one new format one old format . what pain ! also , there definitely seems issue office 2007 opening older office 2003 files . could cause many my problems , but there no way i avoid using old files . they should worked harder compatibility . there good things new 2007 . i like new interface design new features outlook 2007 amazing organizing tasks sharing your calendar . but i don't think it fair microsoft released product so full serious , serious bugs cost me hours hours extra work . i didn't spend hundreds dollars beta product don't think public should suffer . surely they afford better ! new addition my review : today i discovered i no longer paste excel charts into word like i used . when i try , chart goes , but any bars/lines disappear .	-1
i so excited get this ! terrain our lot quite slant it because we're hill . my husband i thought this would easily help us create materials list our retaining walls we wanted put out front . long story short ... i spent hours ( least 40 ) getting dimensions our house correct trying get yard right . we even rented surveying instrument determine slope our yard input elevation points . many hours wasted ... software not let you set height retaining walls it inputs random walls pieces wall 3-d view you can't get rid . flowers hard place , they don't end up where you want them . besides , " plant chooser " doesn't hardly any perrenial plants choose . bottom line : i spent $50 software costs $50 surveying instrument ended up calculate wall length height manually . if you flat lot , this might work well you . anyone hills , or slopes their yard , good luck !	-1

i imported quicken mac quickbooks pro mac after 3 weeks trying make result work , i gave up . interface far less intuitive than quicken ( example , entering vendor names typing first letters then scrolling through choices arrow keys ) not work qb , forcing one guess exact vendor name first time ; imported names addresses not go automatically vendors if they paid , customers if they provide payments ; rather they all go ' other names ' list , thousand or two names it , cannot simply dragged correct list ; rather each one edited individually . when i started forming invoices quotes customers , i found qb would forget customer address , sometimes including it other times yielding blank field . also field lengths qb often shorter than , resulting incomplete import memo fields . addition , export capabilities negligible ; one only export transactions other details proprietary format can't used elsewhere , unlike which exports readable massageable format . overall it seems qb written different company than , large extent programs not compatible even though import qb appears first viewing work ok . it better start new financial year new software enter all data again hand rather than try make qb use data , my view . i switched myob accountedge rather higher cost , find this clean start financial year beginning works ok me . myob product little clunkier than qb more fields fill numbered accounts all over place , its import total joke ( repeated questions where allocate accounts each transaction without explanation screen ) so import any more than 10 transactions becomes laughable ) but its export abilities wonderful i think its inventory control better than qb ; also , it not yet lost invoice addresses way qb me . one input addresses fields before memorizing tranactions however otherwise memorized transactions myob don't update . i found myob intuitive when it comes entry payee fields etc ; while qb lost data entry ease entirely . qb may advantage if your goal includes payroll however ; myob seems pretty sad service unless you prepared pay all taxes yourself .	-1

they changed pretty much everything . starters they completely removed all normal menus such file , tool , edit . which means you can't use keyboard quick easy menu access . well maybe you , but you would memorize all commands instead nice little visual cues which made previous versions office ( almost all other pc programs ) so much easier use . you basically use mouse everything . my experience there no faster way repetitive stress injury than over-mousing . ribbon just awful . first all it huge . it takes up four times space my customized toolbar . they place nearly every button imaginable it . far i tell you can't change it around or simplify it . every function displayed all time whether you need it or not . which makes finding anything real pain neck . you make ribbon retract which first glance seems nice . but reality it turns what used simple 1-click operations into 3-click operations ( extend ribbon , spend several minutes searching button , click button , retract ribbon ) . good grief ! what pain . this software didn't last 24 hours my system before i restored my old version office . this new interface most awful thing i've ever seen computer . i know certain free open source office suites i prefer this monstrosity . said i still prefer any all previous versions ms office free one . fact i would rather using my old wordperfect 1995 than this * thing * ms trying shove down our throats . if only i hadn't thrown disc away six years ago ... before you " invest " your money this software i strongly recommend you download free trial version . then buy earlier version	-1

quicken software continues contain prominent advertising intuit products services . my opinion , it fine offer additional services customers , but give customer opportunity say " no thanks " then leave them alone so they productive software . forever pestering paid customer advertising same products services not good idea . advertising takes up space user interface distraction reduces productivity	-1
my experience just all support calls routed off shore . most tech support staff just take your question type it into their work station . they say " may i put you hold while i check my resources " . then they read answers off their screen . several times i say tech - i can't understand your english . if you buy package i'd find local qb certified accountant pay him/her their time .	-1

i this program 30-day demo . it might ok if i didn't mind my computer becoming almost unusable . i tried run system virus scan , recommended , but after 3 hours it only 2% because it stuck file it couldn't seem get past . i skipped file , but then it quickly got stuck again . " time remaining " said it would take 4 days complete , so i cancelled scan . it learning mode initally blocks everything . apparently , this program no brain . example , i live search toolbar installed outlook . it ask me if it ok run dll file . fact , each program called up process shared dll ask permission before it could run . don't even get me started quickbooks internet explorer problems . which what it wouldn't let those programs , even after they run i repeated clicked " allow " over over . twice today it got so slow running ie it finally crashed computer so bad i hard re-boot . if you it checking ports your computer , almost nothing would run or download ie . so , i'm going demo few more , but it probably back windows live onecare , which i past year . it just doesn't seem much ( no long list features ) , but it also doesn't jam everthing else up	-1

im going rate this product 2 because i like it but i would change few things if i could . it show you lot chords how play properly all good stuff . couple things i would change fact when they teaching you chord , you play program but its only 15 seconds , then you stop click play again . i wish there option where you could choose repeat it its own few times so you dont stop every time play it again . other thing something little more important . product program where you could go online down load lot songs play , its called olga . well this website legal problems not online anymore . so you dont option learning play your favorite songs beetles or metalica or grateful dead or anyone else , thats what they advertise " play hit songs " . so overall , knowing all this i would shopped around more . especially price , its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get little 15 second examples jingle bells little traditional folk songs .	-1

not buy this . go mac os 4.2 tiger , it doesn't crash or lock up . plus you get access really cool applications out box lets you almost anything media-wise . i could go one hours how macintosh operating system better but i say one last thing ... tiger faster than windows . research proved tiger all other operating systems conserve cpu performance such extent 90%-100% speed left applications such . windows eats up so much speed dos 20%-30% performance left user . puts normal windows computer ( 3ghz ) less than 1ghz . while normal mac computer ( 2ghz ) runs 2ghz . plus fastest mac dual g5 each running 2.7 ghz . so actual speed 5.4 ghz . fastest windows computer around 3.6 ghz which runs around 1ghz . huge difference ( 5.4 ghz-1ghz . ) when apple moves intel chips next year ( , ) macs run around 6.4 ghz if not more . even more huge difference . take my word it . windows world not worth it . whenever i go my mom computer ( which running windows xp , ) i encounter lock up or annoying hickup os , every time !! i agree good amount people don't find windows unstable , but even when i go friend house i notice them there well . every windows computer i used more than 20 minutes locked up . but it not just this , it also tiger so much easier use . take my advice ( i've converted many people ) switch mac ... please . i swear most you who read this switch very pleased . it might little wierd first get used new os , but i mastered it day when it took me months windows . plus you purchase microsoft word mac well ( which i think easier use than window counterpart . ) so go throw ugly windows computer away get spanking new , shiny white , stable , mac !!!	-1

reviews this software bit harsh , but pretty much true . it slow , resource hog , doesn't really like share machine other applications . support bad , email transfer move it system just plain doesn't work it really hard make complete backup all your attachments . - windows vista support really limited . said , if you really fast machine it work well features i use every day i can't get anywhere else . you save any email history record attached sender or any other person your contact database . these attachments copies so they stay database even if you purge your email ( which nice ) . email client simple , but because it isn't outlook - i personally almost completely unaffected worms , virus other email hazards over years affected most ms outlook users . this feature saved me more time than hassles first paragraph . program runs smoothly me but , i core 2 duo 7200 2 gigabytes ram . just fastest processor you get . i think without maximum processor memory you delays slooow loading times . one more issue you might making backups . since it uses sql database open whenever sql server running , normal backup program might not able backup database file . you need stop service first . this hassle if you don't know you might setting yourself up disaster .	-1

( btw , 4 messages total 2007 section 6 months . i guess most pay their 300 bucks moderated forum . ) 8 . example how time consuming it : it took me week phone calls several reps get upgrade installation function . i mean it didn't function all . it made such mess i reformat my hard drive get it install . first 20+ years computer use . sage seems think this program only one user installs their computer . bad attitude . sage act ! poster children everything bad software industry today . yourself favor , if older versions working you ... stay there . enhancements 2007 not worth trouble . if you're looking contact manager , look elsewhere .	-1

i bought new state-of-the-art computer february came preloaded windows vista . i initially excited get computer running newest operating system , i hoped it would mean my computer would much longer effective life . i nothing but disappointed since receiving this machine , especially knowing i called dell , they would installed xp instead . pros : -better security ( it prompts me allows me stop some annoying " automatic " programs software makers sneak onto your system)-better appearance ( this strictly cosmetic , i'd rather stare ugly screen worked rather than pretty , useless one)cons : -freezing : i use this computer 2-3 hours day i expect 1-2 freezes/day . restarting often fails , i cut power restart again . -display problems : although cosmetics program better , vista can't display anything right . i tried updating display driver which caused major crash after restarting . i boot safe mode rollback driver get my computer back . apparently , newest display drivers incompatible vista . -incompatibility : entirely too many programs incompatible vista , including some fairly big ones ( lots adobe software , ipods , display drivers , etc . ) i know vista new , these software companies slow adapt , but it really make sense operating system like vista render virtually all my other software obsolete ? why can't vista play nicely other kids ? -its slow !!! -- part reason i bought new , state-of-the-art computer replace my old laptop ( which still runs ok , but become little buggy sluggish past 4 years ) . although this computer light years ahead old one , it actually runs even slower than my old laptop . technical support largely attributed this demands vista . bottom line : 1 . if you not good computers , avoid vista like plague2 . vista rip-off . save your money keep/get xp -- i'm probably going return my computer make manufacturer install xp so i regain some speed system stability . maybe future vista work ok , but not right now ... 3 . incompatibility issues -- though there several -- conspicuously include problems mac-oriented software ( ipod , adobe ) . i can't help but feel microsoft built-in these specific incompatibility issues order battle apple	-1

this huge waste money . if you plans make custom animation , not buy this . anime only alows you manipulate one their few charecters . you not change eye color or hair color . if you want good animation you go one their websites purchase character $10- $20 . their free ones completly dumb . using their " easy use " bone rigging tool takes long time set up use . it took me ten minutes make one stick figure . ( which didn't work very well ) you can't even group anything unless you buy their $180 upgraded version . i spent hours trying use this , could figure none above out . it also took two weeks get here instead four days . i don't recomend this people who looking easy use animation creator .	-1
i used intuit products since 1992 , quite satisfied until 4 years ago when intuit began installing hidden software users ' computers attempt " stop piracy " , which caused numerous problems us honest users who paid program . secondly even more significantly , i began noticing apparent shift intuit philosophy toward it customers : cut back customer support , attempt exploit them every possible opportunity order make more money . short , intuit disrespects their customers . loyal paying customer , i not disrespected or taken granted . their level service support declined . their products constantly pimp you spend more money intuit you try use their programs . why i sworn off intuit products when there alternative . why reward someone who treats you badly ?	-1

ok , sorry , i've vectoring line art since 1990 . my current machine amd athlon xp 333 fsb , 1 gig ram 80 gig hd shared network 40 gig hd software , os xppro , it 2 years old i think . i installed three cathode ray tubes , you know ; big boxy monitors , largest which 21 inch monster right my face all day . i read reviews here started " quaking " my boots ! oops i said myself , i looked up my previous day purchases new artist i just hired . sure enough ; i bought cs2 new machine . so i downloaded 30 day trial illustrator cs2 upyours , i mean upgrade . replacing my old illustrator 8.01 these kids i've interviewing made me think i should take look outside my cave ! so i got it loaded up sure enough ; it takes longer load than my old corrupted rusty buddy ; illustrator 8.01 , twice long . ( so leave it running ) !!!!!!!!! but wow !!!!!!! i should this sooner , or should i ? soon it running illustrator cs2 auto updated itself . it wanted it adobe bridge fixed up . so i let it . this just exactly what people complaining . ******** bridge fixed ********* way super cool dude ! i keep bridge open right monitor i drag art into illustrator cs2 lightning speed . whole time i get see super big previews all artwork i need work . way better than xppro little thumbnails . live trace : realy nice , i think this what these companies using sell vectored line art printers like me . it very accurate seems acomodate all those nasty giant pixels up till now , took human brain see past while vectoring . ok , it not good skilled craftsman such ( full ) myself , but only $160 or so , it like gift almighty god ! no crashes , no bugs , just pure inteligence adobe once again . don't you think little white mud hut dessert when you say adobe ? i really apreciate object oriented work bar thing top , wait , let me go look what it called , hmmmm , still don't know , well it changes according what kind object you've clicked your artwork . also this new wonder technology solves old problem global color change needed color separation work . top task bar object oriented do-hickey similar but better than one photoshop . transparent objects , looks like everything transparent , wow , you know what means ??? i gotta go use it some more , it just way cool . ok , i'm back , even fonts transparent , . tiffs . jpgs , everything . this means way less jumping back forth photoshop illustrator . but i believe you very capable your hardware , operating system , least year ; full time illustrator photoshop fully appreciate thought creative potential adobe opened up us	1
i decided get this office suite after using it recently . i've usually worked office 97 2000 , but 2003 version some pretty cool features not found older versions . feature i really enjoy pivot report feature ms access , which wasn't ms access 2000 . this truly great reporting feature . you now use access front-end slice dice data stored data warehouses oracle , sql server , sybase other enterprise-type databases . if you're used creating crosstab reports , you'll definitely like pivot report feature . crosstabs limited 2 dimensions but there no limitation number dimensions pivot repor t.t o me , main drawback price . ( i get mine around $370 jr , which great price . ) i figure i upgrade this 5 years time , which works out $70 $75 per year ( assuming i'll paying $370 upgrade 5 years time . ) big positive this industry standard . so work you put into learning multiple new features word , excel , ms access not wasted because you reuse same skills job . your time well spent . note software may seem bloated but intelligent user able choose pick most useful relevant features each application ignore features not useful . different features useful different people ... positive : each product office professional fully programmable using visual basic applications ( vba ) which you use build custom programs . this very powerful feature sometimes overlooked when shopping office suites .	1

it basic job well . calibration runs smoothly accurately . hardware looks feels solid . my two completely different brand , size age crt monitors ended up exactly same colors sitting side side . user interface merely adequate . pop up help instructions better than many i seen . you need know already how calibration buttons your monitors work ( hardwired buttons monitor , not software ) . order make any edits you must run entire time consuming calibration over . sometimes you use " back " within calibration , sometimes you must start over . also separate " profile chooser " utility software , not add or delete profile feature - even if it profile created saved calibration software earlier . you see it windows display properties , but it may not appear profile chooser list . dual monitors one obvious reason choose pro over plus version . yes , it dual monitors , but asterisk . it create separate profiles , but only apply correct profiles automatically startup both monitors if you two separate video cards . if you single video card dual outputs , it load same profile ( last one you created ) both monitors startup . this quirk documented readme file installation disk ( blames windows problem ) , but this limitation appears nowhere advertising material , catalogs , or box . fortunately there work around ( not documented ) least my particular video card running xp . after windows opens , you run profile chooser then choose correct profile each monitor . you may use windows display properties settings specify default profile rerun calibration get profiles you want appear profile chooser select correct profile default . once it all set up , running profile chooser four five click procedure , but you must rememeber check it before using any application uses color profiles . check it after you open application . i've them change after opening photoshop - though not every time .	-1

i tested numerous anti-virus programs after getting fed-up previous norton anti-virus , which would always " hang " my incoming email , causing me redownload larger files sometimes make it impossible retrieve them all . ( incidentally , this nothing " time-out " settings . ) after testing other top rated anti-virus programs , only one wouldn't " hang " large email files , kaspersky . even though i my " time-out " set only 1 minute , kaspersky never stumbles lets go , even if it takes much more than 1 minute download . i also like easy use " pause protection " when i'm doing file clean-ups , because there no sense passing temporary files through second time , it speeds clean-up 5 times faster	1

i read lot reviews ( here elsewhere ) warning final cut massive learning curve , i believe helped soften blow when i first tried this program . because there definitely learning curve -- this far more complex than imovie . but , good news , it not beyond newbie reach!i'm such newbie anything video , it pitiful . i only made two or three small movies imovie , they weren't very sophisticated . i mostly just tinkered around . but , fool i am , i decided i wanted get final cut express go new camcorder i just purchased . because i prepared re-learn ( or struggle ) first final cut , i purchased book ( version 2 fce , which perfectly suitable ) . armed my book limited expectations , i set trying make fun little " music video " ( using video clips still pictures ) . amazingly enough , i learned how " ken burns effect " pictures , make transitions one clip next , edit sound so one track would predominate part video , then fade out other parts . i able fix video clips ( zoom , lighten , change aspect ratio ) . then i added titles livetext . all this first two days using final cut ! sure , little video i made no award-winner , but it actually servicable , fun little project i wasn't too ashamed show my friends . ( thing fixing aspect ratio one video clips -- there this one clip seemed resistent any tweaking or adjusting i tried it . i used multiple programs try resize it correct dimensions , but something always went wrong . either picture quality degraded terribly , or else corrected dimensions didn't " stick " it bounced back distorted . nothing worked -- until final cut . i'm sure other programs could same thing , but i tried so many , failed . so thing impressed me ! )i know there whole lot more learn final cut , i certainly don't anticipate i'll become master it . but it offer * lot * more flexibility than imovie , it definitely lot fun . right way approach it , i believe , start small , expect baby steps first , fun , get book ! book absolutely essential . if you impatient soul who expects perfection first day , this not application you . because you learn " it manually , " you much more control -- but it takes time learn it all . oh , note hardware : i made my first little video 1.25 ghz g4 mac mini 512 megs ram . it wasn't speed demon any means , but because my video short ( 2 minutes ) , it really wasn't too painfully slow most time ( except rendering , but i guess going slow anyway ) . i since upgraded mini 1 gb ram , * everything * snappier , so i highly recommend it . but it good know even little mac mini less-than-impressive ram work fce .	1

i television editing my church i dabble alittle home . i many editing programs i use music video editing home movies cams 8mm . i nero 6 it ok , but nero7 ultra ( enhanced ) taken place all other programs . it my primary editing suite music videos . music i make changes songs skating programs where i would send out words removed or create cd pleasure . this program remarkable , there still somethings i not yet used , this best but this type program under $800.00 how much programs we use studio starting price . buying this program great investment .	1
i previously nero 6 it tons bugs me . i upgraded 7 ultra enhanced when i upgraded my computer vista premium , i pleasantly surprised . everything i tried so far flawless . it seems different systems different results nero . example some people say nero 6 works best them , but my old system it horrible ( running win2k ) . it complicated software though , so people should give nero break . overall they great job . just download trial first see how it runs your system .	1

high school college i studied french three years i convinced i would starve death paris trying understand menu then get myself understood . much changed not i am half way through rosetta stone program . my ear now tuned language . i visceral feeling grammar ability discern tenses . my vocabulary still needs get stronger , but now i distinguish individual words stream french , only matter practice language . advertised , this program painless progress rapid . try demo , you'll see .	1
overall i would highly recommend rosetta stone software even though it bit over priced certainly insufficient your primary learning method . rosetta stone * combined * pimsleur great method languages similar your native language . disks copy protected serious drawback you need cd drive any time you going use it you can't use backup copy safety . rosetta stone lessons quick , easy fun , thus encouraging usage . if you afford it i would definitely recommend combining pimsleur rosetta stone . both excellent products far better than less expensive products commonly available . but neither alone sufficient effective learning language . could rosetta stone improved ? certainly . more diverse better graphics would help . graphics they use very good but occasionally picture isn't quite clear meaning . example if you supposed select " boy horse " you may not realize it boy horse . if you questioning if you should get rosetta stone or not , just get free demo cd their website try it yourself . far i tell full product exactly same demo but obviously you access more lessons	1
it seems last few office releases i purchased haven't really offered anything different , but this one . interface totally changed takes some getting used . i would suggest upgrading office 2007 when you little time figure out new layout not if you jump right into project . new toolbars seem really thought out very user friendly . if you aren't into change prefer status quo standard , file edit tools ... layout , then this product not you . if you willing spend couple hours getting used new layout ( it quite easy ) you won't sorry because it well worth it .	1

i purchased mangadebut because i wanted dabble tones inking ( which i usually never , usually i just scan sketch then darken it photo editing . ) i came find out using lines erasing sketch makes much more clean finished product . course , you could acomplish this ms paint if you really wanted . one main ( only , my opinion ) advantages this program amazingly vast variations tones available make your art more interesting . alone makes it worth 50 dollars you put into it . one downside this program , because it many tones , uses requires quite bit space . when i uploaded it my laptop , it slowed down significantly . so much so now i load it when i want finish nice drawing delete it computer again ! xdoverall it deserves 3-4 stars . ^.^	-1

brain builder series visual auditory exercises aimed improving attention , concentration memory . this consists seven exercises , one involving visual reaction speed accuracy six memorizing sting randomly generated numbers presented audiably or visually one three modes -- base ( straightforward ) reverse ( you must give back string reverse order given ) flash ( visual numbers presented one time instead all once like base ) or random ( auditory where you cope numbers read uneven pace ) . you then immediately tested type what those . there no time limit response . you progress higher levels -- which means memorizing more numbers faster during viewing or listening -- initially determined baseline test taken when first starting . different voices -- men , women , adults , children -- read auditory presentations . all all , i found it fairly sophisticated exercises seem help even beyond matters number memorization . primary shortcoming seemed lack feedback or coaching other than telling you not get discouraged keep working hard . also , progress summeraries ( bar graphs ) fail take into account higher levels scoring purposes so day day comparison results seems too flat . overall , i enjoyed program stuck it although there some days i wish more variety something else than just repeat numbers . what they say only practice 10 minutes day--well--i've spend more like 30 minutes or more enough exercises feel satisfied my progress	-1

i found product work very well antivirus , spyware spam . it nice one product reasonable price multiple functions rather than 3-4 sperate products their associated cost maintenance . i using norton 2004 , but it only good job viruses . although it would detect spyware after fact , it poor job removing them . i also used ms beta , which although detected more spyware than norton , would not block it . i one computer always seemed crippled spyware . since i installed pc-cillin , i've no problems . i've also found spam blocker work fairly well , catching 80% spam . i using multiple rules spam list outlook , probably only blocked 40% spam , so this big improvement . my only complaint rebate- i sent required info it rejected due " invalid/missing ups . " i then sent copy ups they indicated missing , but never got anything back .	1

don't think video capture cards , going into operating system , or even opening computer case - just turn power , plug dazzle usb plug into your usb port , connect colored cords your vcr same colored plugs dazzle , install software , let this wonderful tool all heavy lifting . excellent quality , they lower quality if you want smaller file - like , say , if you want back-up your vcr cd-r . test quality time - tell it record 70 minutes , your work . i really like fact software so stable , i recorded six hour vcr tape using 512 meg xp machine - not moment problem . they also included software makes editing these video files real easy , if you want . just icing cake . strong , solid , silent - john wayne vcr computer file translator tools . aside , i held onto some vcr tapes years , one more than decade , hoping something like dazzle would come . prayers answered . just shut up buy it	1

i think some reviewers here not use program more enough , am using it since version 2 till now illustrator this program can't beated ... gradient fill so stupid create earlier versions adobe illustrator u must create two objects then blend them together form gradient fill then you mask it within path or shape you filling , one more thing mask corel " container " wonderful tool much better than mask used illustrator sucks ( u see me pulling out my hear if i made i mistake using it ) you want more i lot mention . am using both program everyday know them very well honest i all artwork coreldraw then i export illustrator color separation printing becuase printers agancies my country don't know how use corel so i ride wave finalize thing illustrator . i all detailed drawings precisely using guidelines grid ( first available corel ) creating layouts , realistic objects or models shadings shadowing well ease this software so powerfull if you real artist you must get i	1

this probably one most outstanding rewarding software programs i ever remember purchasing . i never learned how type , so i reserved myself many computer projects/reports , email responses business related aspects due this ' achilles heel ' . well , i researched this software found it come long way earlier versions decided it time give it try . i even bought plantronics cs55 - usb wireless headset get go give this software real workout . let me tell you , my pessimism definitely challenged because software worked extremely good 20 minutes after opening box browsing tutorial . i talking sentences watched it appear my monitor within seconds . i speeded up my speach if talking normal conversation someone this software just kept spitting it on-screen . amazing !!!! don't get me wrong . there occasional misspellings deal but your user profile keeps getting updated everytime you use it prevents same mistakes occuring next time . it begins gain more more accuracy . salvation found far i'm concerne d.p.s. i began running program win xp - 512mb ram it performed very well . i just upped 2 gigs ram . most everyone forums recommends least 1 gig ram . i this review 1 min . only two misspells .	1
product nice clean interface . i able load most drivers application software without incident . note - upgrade install requirements not clear . microsoft should state what expected your system prior trying install either upgrade or clean install . microsoft sites keep pointing back sites don't help very much .	-1
this my second version/upgrade . it very easy use i sought it out when upgrading my previous version . love it	1
i bought this program my daughter her birthday . she wanted it because she used it school ( 1st grade ) . i impressed how easy it install - i installed it admin , she no issues running it under her limited account ( xp pro ) . i've impressed what she able program . she even made valentine day cards her whole class it . just prepared go through lot color ink	1
essential microsoft office 2007 users running windows vista . office 2007 already provides pdf converter ; however , it not allow security , editing , or markup . pdf converter -- without tech support hassles adobe . since my new hp computer came adobe reader already installed vista environment , i kept it default pdf reader , i use pdf converter professional actual , stand alone conversion or editing pdf documents . pdf converter very easy custom install feature . i disabled all microft office , internet explorer , outlook add-ins , i installed product . it all works together extremely well .	-1
after looking other reviews , i bit puzzled . i haven't any problems other folks mention . pdf converter professional 4 doesn't everything programs costing five times much money . but , who cares ? background colors business form ? why ???? don't buy camry say " gee ... i liked my lexus better . " most you going buy this program one - or both - these two things : 1)convert pdf documents into completely editable word docs , excel worksheets , or one dozens other formats ... 2)combine documents various formats into single pdf . picture customer manual consists word , excel , solidworks , quicken , powerpoint project documents . you want put them all together one document complete table contents , bookmarks thumbnails . voila ! this proram you ! these purposes , pdf 4 professional superb . it easy use . we several users , not one refer manual or line support . put pdf converter test , we recently scanned , then saved-as-a-pdf crooked , not highly legible fax . we then converted it into word document , roughly 90% it came through perfectly . amazing . highly recommended	1
coreldraw my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up my desk small " mom pop " screenprinting shop i worked . back then , corel came oodles free fonts , clipart , manuals ... not mention free technical support via toll-free number . i stayed corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches , bugs dreaded " odd-numbered " curse ( if you tried version 5 or 7 , you feel my pain ) . adobe photoshop always my photo-editing program choice ... corelphotopaint just never quite " it " me . industry demands eventually delegated i delve into adobe illustrator . already familiar adobe photoshop features , tools " look feel " , illustrator didn't present huge , overbearing learning curve . illustrator , i found same robust features coreldraw ... which wasn't what impressed me illustrator . adobe intuitive programs , their ability interact one ... seamlessly ... what won me over illustrator . illustrator ability edit/create pdf their native format ? wow ! exporting layered vector files photoshop ... layers intact ??? wow !!! ( i could go on)now , said ... there still things i prefer coreldraw compared illustrator . extrude function corel much easier utilize . powerclip function more user friendly than illustrator " make clipping mask " function . ability customize/edit/add shortcut keys amazing feature . ( again ... i could go on)in regards importing exporting files other applications , coreldraw wins , hands down . it boasts robust set import export filters , my favorite . eps import filter which lets you import . eps while converting fonts curves during import . this must if you work . eps file created computer whose fonts you lack . if i dollar every . eps pulls into illustrator fonts blown out ... i'd independently wealthy . why illustrator never implemented this beyond me . so , sum it up ... coreldraw great program ... but i can't imagine it my only vector drawing program . just like real life , you need great team . this program , paired adobe creative suite , meets my needs perfectly	-1

xitel inport deluxe what it says it . you plug any rca aux connector into unit software provided you record it stereo your computer . it good solid product what it says it but instead focusing features like other reviewers i point out its minor drawbacks . first , audacity , free software mentioned manual tendency freeze up while recording unit . however , i don't know if it freeze up your computer . second , if you thinking buying this product turn lps cds , into most lp players don't rca aux plugs you'll need buy addapter . ( what they don't tell you manual if you this you first need adjust volume stereo recorder volume parallel which kinda tricky . ) finally , manual could use more detail because some important features weren't mentioned . if you don't mind these drawbacks , you able many years recording pleasure if you buy this product	-1

love program .... hate company!i've using quickbooks more than 10 years . i started basic edition since i am very small business use only portion program , specifically customer vendor lists , invoicing , a/r purchase orders . overkill understatement ... quickbooks pro much more powerful than i need . i don't use payroll , check printing , year end accounting many its other functions . so why i purchase such powerful program ? that " rub " . intuit not satisfied its quickbooks users content edition they using ; intuit sales people call all too frequently trying get you upgrade next higher version ( edition ) their program . they hounded me years upgrade early basic edition then current basic edition ; finally , they dropped support product i no choice . i purchased quickbooks 2005 basic edition 2005 . shortly after purchasing it , they informed me they no longer going support 2005 basic edition if i wanted continued support i would upgrade again , this time pro edition . this january ( 2007 ) i received email intuit informing me my 2005 basic edition wouldn't run new windows xp vista platform if i switched vista i would need upgrade quickbooks pro . i upgraded new pc february result major crash my former system opted go vista , thinking i could install windows 98 second operating system run quickbooks 2005 basic . second operating system didn't work out , after seriously considering switching microsoft accounting 2007 , i purchased quickbooks pro . i very disappointed intuit didn't offer significant purchase incentive existing users ; but they never all years i've using their product . even microsoft , shark sharks , offers incentives . don't misheartened . i purchased program amazon , rebates other purchase incentives , saved $60 over intuit price ; i could saved additional $25 if i bought ebay ( i known it time ) .	-1

first time several versions microsoft changed file format . however , it better . new files all compressed using zip compression format so files much smaller ( old files 3-4 times larger than new files ) . new file formats supposed compatible cross platform specification ( i.e. linux geeks open office documents ) . new interface radically different . not install this if you large project complete . interface so different you not complete time . however , after month so you wonder how you ever got without it	1

i bought bhg deluxe 7.0 software plan addition . i talked companies shopped around before purchasing . i not talk imsi floor plan 3d , i gave up after trying get through human . i would bet guess software good imsi telephone skills . i talked punch software warned away their product their own tech i integrated video my computer . apparently you need video card minimum video memory render drawings any usable speed using punch software . punch software loss , not mine that ridiculous issue consumer software product . chief architect offered money back guarantee their better homes gardens products , even if purchased via vendors like amazon . i'll keep this better homes gardens home designer deluxe software , even though it it annoying quirks . even lesser package pro version , library items it very limited . i would guess there quite few more pro version , but it odd not include more most standard items many home owners would need when laying out home . you learn just use nearly matched symbol fill space , even though it not correct symbol or size item . since i am not interested 3d view , this not big issue me . item i needed most floorplanning . 3d modeling extra item i may play , but not essential me personally . if you truly interested 3d aspect , this issue . i would recommend visiting product forum see what best choice . [ ... ] quick easy floor plan software few extras , this software better than ok . no experience necessary , short tutorial videos get you started quickly . i issues not able more control wall types , there some odd roof design limitations even mid low priced consumer package . these annoying enough urge upgrade pro if you want more control all aspects . since i laying out floor plan , then turning it over architect real softare , it not problem me . i few restarts due drawings getting all wild messed up , but ignoring autosaved drawings , i able go back my last manually saved drawing start known good point . this software upgrade options download company site . just like any good software company , they provide spftware patches download . i would definately recommend this software quick way floor plans . adding walls , doors , windows , other items very simple . just don't plan perfection , it based prefabbed walls limited whole inches , not fractions . angles issue well . if you need specific angles , this not package , it preset increments only . i wish it default preferences user could select well . able preset your roofing style preferences or other items would eliminate quite bit redo . i hope software companies read these reviews . there alot good information how improve products .	-1

i purchased this product needing work personal legal ( nonbusiness ) matter , so noncommercial license fine my " home " use . good thing i checked corel after buying it seeing " home edition " captions not only total suite packaging but underneath " wordperfect " " quattro pro " components ( inside front box folding cover velcro ) . corel ultimately confirmed me " certain components designed business customer , such legal tools , metadata removal , document compare , quickfinder name few not included home edition version . " corel needs make this clearer their marketing " home edition . " i focused word processing application , but quattro pro application also captioned " home edition " so it may missing some features available quattro pro included other suite versions ( standard , pro , student/teacher , etc . ) . home edition may still suitable some users , but i'm strong believer " full disclosure . " wordperfect itself great program . try setting point sizes decimals word -- you can't . try changing size font legal pleadings word -- there no direct control it ( microsoft site instructs you change margins number lines per page attempt get word adjust font size ) [ but remember , you need any wordperfect version other than home edition get legal tools ]	-1
i purchased both home gardens interior punch interior software . home gardens much easier use . you really start without reading much manual . punch demands you read manual ( 342 pages ) . it not intuative . but punch so much more so much more creativity . ie : punch library trees , shrubs flowers your yard . home gardens only potted plants , nothing you use landscape . punch also allows you make custom doors or windows your exact specifications . hg doesn't . you choose set style door or window change options . i also could place digital photos my backyard behind my " house " punch make it more realisitic . i like both software programs , but punch more options , but you your homework first	-1

coreldraw my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up my desk small " mom pop " screenprinting shop i worked . back then , corel came oodles free fonts , clipart , manuals ... not mention free technical support via toll-free number . i stayed corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches , bugs dreaded " odd-numbered " curse ( if you tried version 5 or 7 , you feel my pain ) . adobe photoshop always my photo-editing program choice ... corelphotopaint just never quite " it " me . industry demands eventually delegated i delve into adobe illustrator . already familiar adobe photoshop features , tools " look feel " , illustrator didn't present huge , overbearing learning curve . illustrator , i found same robust features coreldraw ... which wasn't what impressed me illustrator . adobe intuitive programs , their ability interact one ... seamlessly ... what won me over illustrator . illustrator ability edit/create pdf their native format ? wow ! exporting layered vector files photoshop ... layers intact ??? wow !!! ( i could go on)now , said ... there still things i prefer coreldraw compared illustrator . extrude function corel much easier utilize . powerclip function more user friendly than illustrator " make clipping mask " function . ability customize/edit/add shortcut keys amazing feature . ( again ... i could go on)in regards importing exporting files other applications , coreldraw wins , hands down . it boasts robust set import export filters , my favorite . eps import filter which lets you import . eps while converting fonts curves during import . this must if you work . eps file created computer whose fonts you lack . if i dollar every . eps pulls into illustrator fonts blown out ... i'd independently wealthy . why illustrator never implemented this beyond me . so , sum it up ... coreldraw great program ... but i can't imagine it my only vector drawing program . just like real life , you need great team . this program , paired adobe creative suite , meets my needs perfectly .	-1

my four-year-old son loved first fritz chesster so much i just get second . i would gotten third installment well , but it appears require dvd-rom more up-to-date software than he his computer ( i suggest you always review those details before buying ) . like first , this second installment same quirky artistic sensibility lots amusing details keep me interested it he . first one seemed lot more " british " than this one . just one example : first installment , pawns often depicted english villagers low-brow accents . this installment they more often texas ranchers ... there also numerous britishisms first installment tough understand child . this one thankfully free them . i suppose american audience proved more lucrative than original designers expected .... i think suggested age more 6-or-above ( they really should able read , i suppose ) , but little help even younger child ( such my son ) get into most exercises spend time it . there several more advanced features this one than first installment . here focus basic tactics , openings , endgame situations . so child should really made it through first one before getting this . he absolutely know all rules , instance -- second installment not going teach them . first also some wonderful exercises just pawns or kings board , instance , much teach . some fun games like maze monster chasing you ( teach rook moves ) or cannon fires diagonally ( teach bishop ) . some games here ( which resemble early video games , like space invaders ) little too advanced four-year-old manual dexterity .... perhaps six-year-old well . but there many things he get into nonetheless , especially if you take time explain things get them started . overall , i'd say if you want give child introduction game , nothing beats first fritz chesster . other chess teaching video games much darker less helpful , really , beginners . if he or she likes first installment ( which also very girl-friendly ) , then all means advance second -- especially kids over 6	1

well presented , easy follow , easy revisit previous lessons . videos illustrated fretboard really help see hear how song should played . not lot depth material but probably right level maintain attention most students . some accompanyment/singing could better but overall good job presenting music so student practice . some material/songs may not everyones liking , but again , these okay beginner . singing slight destraction sometimes . i probably wouldn't recommend this only source learning guitar .... i don't think most people buying it would think it all every need become great guitar player . i'm sure teacher would still very advantageous especially when it comes pointing out bad habits may creep into new students technique . i'm trying learn without teacher well found other music books very useful . bottom line ; this good product provides good start learning play guitar .	-1

main reason negative reviews past extra charge mp3 encoder . this version , mp3 encoder included . magix pretty clever designing interface used quickly yet several more advanced features you use you become more proficient . these include full featured waveform editor very powerful sonagram ( spectral ) editor . also , somewhat hidden ability record 78rpm records 33 1/3 turntable . if you use full set features almost any record made totally free pops clicks . i two very minor negatives ; amplitude scale track display somewhat truncated , declicker so few artifacts i recommend always using it maximum setting ( opposed wizard manual recommendations . ) far pc requirements , i believe any program lot number crunching needs fairly up-to-date processor . this one particularly so because it leaves original audio files intact . i don't believe this negative some prior reviews . short , i totally satisfied this program ability make clean transfers both 78rpm 33 1/3 rpm records .	1

i agree , windows could improve thier products but i'm not going jump linux bandwagon just yet . you get this product academic 84.00 web . i own several copies my home computers . if you network use wireless this program use . i use both unix windows work unix far more stable . compatibility issues what kills unix/linux now linux not user friendly . future apple linux some same issues windows deal they become more popular . windows dominates reason . also , when you upgrade select full install not upgrade . you need full version copy windows 98 , windows me , or windows 2000 accomplish this . registering your software microsoft virtually painless , even if you need new key . you load windows five times before your key expires . point you call them new one . i'd buy this product again amazon great company deal with- five stars them !!	-1
i ordered box version amazon , instead download manufacturer not only because it less expensive , but main reason so i would paper manual . so many programs don't come hard copy manuals i prefer them over on-line help . program itself , i trialed download first . me , thing i fell love ability call up multiple images , side side , compare them ! it makes selecting best image breeze - huge timesaver . you also ability swiftly zoom check focus full rez . wonderful thing putting curser over one preview images , sliding it , slide all open previews simultaneously , so you don't individually zoom move each image . you this up 6 images time ! you also quick histogram check hitting " " key , which makes it easy toss off bad exposures same time review . while you've got previews open you hover mouse over them hit any # key color-code image . colors keyed whatever description you want . i " 1 = green " yes , " 2 = yellow " maybe , " 3 = red " no . there room quite few more colors after . i then hit sort key back main screen quickly select all red " no " images delete them . after i all my green " yes " images , i then review them 6 time give them star ratings . i resort rating now all best images top page i start processing them . you batch process file name , some other things i don't bother , well . it got some nice keywording ability you easily sync keywords your photoshop files . what incredibly nice you click any word keyword list all images you own , those keywords , immediately shown thumbnails ! finding image actually fun ! it even give you thumbnails images you don't even store your hard drive anymore ! fantastic program - i highly recommend it ! only reason i didn't 5 star it b/c it not all intuitive . this read-the-manual kind program , but you awful lot it without get too far book . ;)	-1

after removing symantec installing zonealarm my computer speeded up factor least 10 . i'm not certain why symantec slows some computers down but leaves others going fast -in my case it insisted scanning every program transferred used scanning every outgoing email even though i truned those features off . i recommend zonealarm users some expertise - during initial usage you need understand what programs allow what block ( look them up google )	1
i bought version 5 this software few years ago very pleased many features . tech my isp ( bellsouth ) recommended this software me . i recently purchased version 6 my new laptop which running windows xp pro . installation snap . updates frequent install quickly my dsl connection . software suite my opinion more better features than norton pro which i use my desktop . i really like registry cleaner ( fixer ) defrag tools . ( they use trend micro virus protection ) program allows simple maintenance or more experienced users indepth tools allow you maintain tweak your system . there lot extra programs come this software i not install after reading some reviews warnings using them . however , my personal experience after installing just system suit 6 professional really good me . i bought my copy walmart filled out rebate following instructions carefully i received my rebate after 6 weeks . i hope if anyone buys this software because my recommendation similar results . i would rate my knowledge computers above average , which may why i not any problems software .	1

i , too , used complain norton poor customer service awful inability smoothly upgrade . until i tried two other major products home changed employers one major norton competitor ( products included mcafee antivirus , computerassociates ' etrust , couple well-rated free-ware packages ) . bottom line protection without getting way . according numerous reviews , norton provides excellent protection . addition , it ability exclude known safe directories it stops protecting almost immediately when you realize it spending lot cpu cycles scanning known good file you ask it stop -- example , etrust menu allows you tell it stop , but it doesn't take effect until next transaction , which too late speed up lengthy , trustworthy transaction . norton easy intuitive configure , even its significantly more complex internet security package . all products i've tried , including major ones , fail one or all these key attributes . therefore , i'll put up norton awful renewal process weak customer service order product what it designed flexible enough reasonable it . since recent reviews reveal no single product provides good coverage against spyware , i supplement norton product periodic scans spyware using " adaware " " pest patrol " , i keep " startup inspector " installed guard	-1

this my 3rd year doing my taxes turbotax . i encountered some bugs non-material stuff , but i didn't go hand-check entire return so i don't know if there would any material bugs would actually affect dollar amounts . bugs i encountered following : - when asking me changes my address which it imported last year return , it didn't provide phone numbers . one those phone numbers changed . later , when doing state taxes , it asked which phone number i wanted use . time , it provided choice old phone number but didn't allow me update it . - it seemed import all information my financial institution ok it reported dollar amounts net proceeds cost basis correctly . however , worksheet , even though description said it sale 50 shares , quantity field said one share . little bugs like these make me wonder if all math underneath ok . i'm also worried if you run program different order , results might different . but who knows ? cursory check things looked ok . one thing i bummed when entering buys corresponding stock sale it allowed me enter things reverse chronological order ( fact didn't prompt me otherwise ) yet end program when doing audit checks , it wanted me reenter data chronological order . i didn't bother since it only affected worksheet . i'm keeping my fingers crossed there no material errors ! unfortunately , it looks like other tax products also these kinds weird bugs	-1
final cut express hd awesome . but don't try learn how use fce your own - buy book such final cut express dummies spend some time working through concepts . i previously used adobe premiere , so making switch fce not quite hurdle going others . if you make jump imovie , realize you need spend lot time learning how use fce . if you going edit simple home movies , probably stick imovie . imovie quick simple . but professional results , definitely use fce . but realize there fairly steep learning curve . once mastered , editing fce quick . i use fce professional quality editing work when i need edit down multiple cameras shooting simultaneously ( feature final cut pro now makes automatic , but not fce ) , complex editing involving numerous audio video tracks . i routinely re-arrange my audio one clip overlay over . i also routinely adjust audio levels mix multiple audio tracks . while fce hd comes soundtrack application , most my audio editing fce audio tools directly . livetype titling application also bundled fce hd enables creation broadcast quality titling titling effects . livetype worth price fce hd alone ! fce also includes huge assortment both audio video filters adjust or clean up original content , or color filters match colors multiple cameras . except simple home movies , where i still sometimes use imovie , i use fce hd everything else . i could not produce type material i create without fce hd . i strongly recommend fce anyone wishing produce professional quality video results , especially those who need synchronize mix multiple video audio tracks and/or use advanced titling features livetype . like most video applications , more ram better . fce sort runs my 640 mb ram powerbook g4 . but it files my dual 867 mhz g4 2 gb ram ( but 1 gb would plenty ) . if you going doing video editing , gb ram very desirable	1

since i remember , fantastic four always my favorite comic book . it not just characters interesting their own issues , but it also they human well superheroes . appeal ben grimm , sweetness sue storm , brash johnny storm ultra-scientific ( never quite dorky ) reed richards perfect team because they grew together drew you into their lives . but let not forget ff also brought many novel comic aspects : watcher , negative zone , inhumans , course , galactus silver surfer . growing up ff i consider " golden era " this comic book years which stan lee jack kirby worked them ( up issue 100 or so ) . particular , issues introduction black panther ( one my all-time favorite stories ) introduction him ( warlock ) particularly interesting . this 2 year time frame , dr. doom stole silver surfer powers , kree resurfaced , blastaar made his presence known while reed danger negative zone . all wonderful stories , jack kirby artwork its peak . you see all this yourself this collection more . you read stan most eloquent prose admire jack creative capabilities one great comic book artists . you also able see ebb flow stories , how different writers took ff other directions , how comic book floundered how it reborn . indeed , due its longevity , ff not just indomitable team 4 superheroes , but collective effort great artists writers brought these creations life pages medium not considered artistic many . collection contained dvd all acrobat format scanned images real comic books . thus , you see yellowing pages , smudges , tears , etc . me , this good thing , because it shows comics collector items . ( i don't think making antique look new good thing . if antique well-preserved , ok , but it still antique . ) whole , i am very satisfied this purchase few dollars took stroll down memory lane convenience my computer or laptop . i still my own collection , including those captured marvel collectors item classics ( first reprints ff comics later became marvel greatest comics ) , but collection this set unsurpassed well worth every penny	1
if you want get digital photos out your camera out email , this good place start . snapfire puts basic functions where you find them makes them relatively easy understand . it helps if you understand pixel dimensions , but it isn't required . first thing you need see how big your photo when displayed computer screen email recipient . simply open photo click " zoom 100% . " that true size . if you drag your photo into photo tray ( see more below dragging restrictions ) , you also see photo dimensions file size placing your cursor over photo thumbnail . if photo too big you want resize it , you so edit menu ( " resize " ) setting new pixel dimensions ( e.g. 800x600 ) or setting new size percentage original . then view resulting photo size using " zoom 100% " . when it right size , save it . crop also easy . you crop any shape you want , or standard proportions ( e.g. 4x6 ) . again , " zoom 100% " see results . that pretty much all it takes get photo ready email . my only complaint when you resized photo it still your editing window , you can't see its current properties ( dimensions file size ) without saving it . ( when you save it , it placed photo tray , you put your cursor over it see details . ) snapfire standard photo enhancement options such red-eye correction , " quick fix , " adjustments brightness warmth , also " makeover " option which used whiten teeth remove blemishes . you also , course , rotate photos . you insert text add picture frames . same options available other software , but i like fact this product not so overloaded options it difficult use . i would find it relatively easy guide someone through processes even if they inexperienced . it still all features i would need . i haven't used download software , but it appears put photos into my pictures , standard location . when you go snapfire home page , you first highlight folder you want work using " find files " left pane . individual photos folder appear right main editing screen . there you select one photo edit , or drag multiple photos into photo tray bottom easier access . if you put your cursor over photo photo tray you see its dimensions size . one option i personally like ability unlock aspect ratio when resizing photo . if you ever capture photos video source , you sometimes may find photos distorted . example , people may look fat . unlocking aspect ratio allows you fix photos . warning : i tried sending slide show friend they unable open it without obtaining snapfire software . i felt i sending snapfire advertising , so won't using this feature .	-1

apple iwork software presents two applications : pages keynote which apple answer microsoft publisher power point . someone who used both , i honestly say iwork blows publisher power point clean out water . keynote some added features such 3d graphs capaibility add numbers charts ( like very limited spread sheet ) added this version . you make truly professional looking mind blowing presentations keynote make any presentation look like multimedia jewel . pages allows you desktop publishing print media finesse end results professional looking print catalogs brochures . both applications well designed , just like all ilife apps , feature classic apple interface whereby all your media content available intermeshed into work flow . there not really any new earth shattering features 06 05 version , but mainly just tweaks enhancements . far , biggest disappointment lack upgrade pricing availability users previous versions . you pay full price even if you bought iwork ' 05 . family pack version $99 really good buy you get five licensed copies versus single user copy which only gives you one installation $79 . family pack definitely way go especially if you need install more than one mac . this excellent product works really tight . i only give four stars no upgrade pricing no new applications bundled package . if you need slide show presentations front group , then purchase price worth cost keynote alone . it really rocks	-1

ratings relative other racing games . no doubt if this your thing you like this game . it not arcade game like gta or nfs but intended seems succeed simulation . several help / assists make it easier rookies . extrordinarily difficult maximum settings , but satisfying if you " dumb down " competition bit , otherwise learning curve intensity extreme . line play available but expect contend both obsessed extremely skilled components well crash happy losers . i would consider this most compelling perhaps realistic racing simulation around . fabulous 3d rendering really requires current high end hardware . using macbook pro ( xp boot camp ) it works really well . hate admit how much time i've spent playing this . way cheaper than running real race cars lot safer . works great logitech g25 . problems : missing online code available manufacturer via e-mail . starforce copy protection annoying ( requires original disk drive ) but not caused any problems i am aware	1
outstanding ! copy protection kind stinks but software itself great ! very , very realistic driving experience . on-screen performance matches true vehicle performance . many customizaton options . i end up downloading " cheat " give me more options rather than win them racing 4 cylinder econo-racers but overall experience outstanding ! i would highly recommend this software any racing enthusiast	1

purchased it gift my brother got it two days after i ordered it .	1
i've using this piano trainer 2 months now , am up lesson 100 or thereabouts . i've spending 1/2 hour each day it , os mac midi/usb piano keyboard attached it . each day , i start my " tail " lesson , then work through all other ones up my " current " lesson . then i " tail " lesson again . if i play it computer rating me 99 or 100% , i declare i've " passed " lesson , move tail up next lesson next day . if i don't pass , i keep tail where it . other , " current " , end , i usually move up one lesson per day , unless current one particularly challenging . i also usually one " goof off/preview " lesson where i just relax try little fun next lesson beyond current one , giving myself little treat look forward . i usually take weekends off , only my lessons if i'm feeling like i want . during weekdays , i find it nice way just " something different " after day office , quickly find myself sucked ; lesson time passes quickly . system worked quite well me so far . i've stayed motivated am making definite consistent progress . program works very well most part . each lesson displays sheet music , button plays lesson it should sound . plus , most lessons video snippets instructor giving detailed examples hints . most lessons also button where you play accompanied other instruments . after you play lesson , computer rates your performance , 0 100% correct , shows sheet music where you made mistakes ( wrong notes , notes played too long or short , etc . ) . there few bugs os mac version . worst sound volume level instructor / example music can't changed . there slider this preferences window , but it doesn't work . volume stuck maximum , so it far , far louder than sound coming my own playing . other serious bug automatic lesson grader almost always indicates you've played final note lesson too short , even if you hold it down far too long ; this seems especially true if final note whole note . other bug i regularly see window pop up saying something script interpreter crashing . this doesn't seem cause any problems , but it annoying . other than , program seems solid . it uses better piano sound than one comes built-in mac ; it still isn't realistic like ones casio yamaha keyboards , but it good enough	-1

this software seems brilliant - very accurate job scanning decoding . it could improved allowing multiple page scans ( without set timer page insert)it defintely save you time . it not appear page storage/filing system like some ocr programs but 5 stars its scanning decoding . registration becomes problem if you reinstall software several times ( i redo my computer frequently ) , it not smart enough know it same machine forces you contact technical support . ms office recognise its same machine so its not hassle . if you interested document storage filing computer then other ocr might better choice . if you want accurate page scanning modification changes i would most highly recommend this software .	-1

i'm not sure what software other reviewer using , but i've using office accounting since 2006 release i love it . i upgraded my old 2006 file 2007 ease . i running it core2 duo machine no issues . no crashing , etc . i used this software under windows xp well windows vista business . my only reason 4 stars online banking features don't work like microsoft money . my bank only allows money/quicken connect directly , or i'm able download excel sheet my data . office accounting lists my bank , but tells me i need download my data my bank instead it automatically doing it . i bit strange since money handles this no problem . anyway , it great software price ..	-1
i purchased this software 2 weeks ago , i say it far superior any other product its price range . i admit it not nearly intuitive they say it , but learning curve ( me ) isn't steep . i say some reservations , because i went school media production probably little better knowledge base work than average beginner . make matters more difficult , cakewalk products ( my experience ) always very poorly written manuals . music creator , they seem made effort improve area . it first cakewalk manual i've seen actually screenshots whatever particular topic . thank heaven small favors . avoid experiences like other reviewers apparently , i would recommend following1 . buy boxed version instead download website . yes , it ten bucks more you pay shipping , but boxed version , you get manual ( pictures , no less ) well separate cd video tutorials , plus some other extras . cd tutorials first . if you get stuck after , info help section makes alot more sense . 2 . if you don't background recording , get yourself home recording how-to book . there millions them out there , they extremely useful if you don't really understanding jargon . one thing cakewalk they say you don't any experience use their products , but somehow they assume you're familiar terminology . if you're just looking some backing tracks jam , or drag drop midi sequencing , this job , but probably alot more than you need . if you're like me looking all-in-one solution take song melody knocking around your head finished , mastered product cd or mp3 ( you don't cash protools or reason ) this might just what you're looking .	-1

take it easy , get comfortable , lessons repeat themselves after few hours you amazed how much you retain . sceptical first , but next afternoon when i telling friend which words i learned , we shocked how much i retained . it easy , it repetative , it making me wish i oredered all 3 levels once . my oldest child now takng spanish high school , so i order her all 3 levels . we let her sisters use it get jump spanish well . they start spanish class two years . this good investment , contractor overseas working , it paid off price paid time spent learning . shows respect others when you learn their language communicate them .	1

i agree this really dumb . what point ? original cd may backed up ( thank god ) , so it useless anti-theft device . i am mac user , i messed around using disk images replace cd , but without success . apparently they only permit direct hardware calls cd drive . may check some gurus see if there workaround . basically good product , but just enough dumb , annoying flaws ( over priced ) prevent five stars	-1

i assumed , incorrectly , adobe customer service would professional quick . i called three times past two weeks wait , minimum , 23 minutes just speak someone . when i finally got my product , they sent mac verion rather than pc version i purchased . i called again waited approximately 30 minutes get customer help . i originally ordered pc standard version asked upgrade ( pay difference ) professional version -- since i still hadn't received pc version . customer service stated they would only ship me standard version replace incorrectly shipped mac version then i would wait standard verison arrive which point i could call again , ask exchange professional verion - insane !!! adobe call center easily worst customer service i dealt -- i've dealt some bad customer service	-1
only redeeming quality this gps system it cheap . i used it 1,000 mile trip east coast week after i got it . navigation poor . i found i often look over laptop screen because i " off route " so often due poor maps . system repeated same annoying problems i see other feedback . 1 ) unit would show me off road even though i interstate . this case it would continually recalculate route diretc me take exits get off highway circle around . 2 ) it directed me make turns onto one-way streets wrong direction . 3 ) it could not locate poi turned out few hundred yards away 4 ) it often not know correct side road my destination 5 ) it doesn't provide chime when it time turn . it tell you turn half-mile ahead , but might last time you hear instruction . 6 ) one case , it got me my destination ( least close enough ) but couldn't guide me back my starting poin t.t he gps receiver seemed acquire hold satellite signal well . but maps poor , verbal instruction - it sounds like 1980 computer generated voice . if you're looking trustworthy guide unfamiliar areas - this isn't i t.t his going back asap .	-1

familiar some adobe products , we opted try this work cheaper alternative than some other packages simple web graphics work . boy , we disappointed . simply put , this tool not so much tool , but hindrance . utilities such transparencies , not only difficult make work properly , but hidden non-intuititve locations . dialogs non-standard , which requires getting used strange layouts design . while seeminly small just couple items i've mentioned , multiply this supposed feature set product you start get idea how cumbersome tool really . mentioned plenty other people , it also slow . if you want simple image viewer , find anything else - even freeware , i never come across image utility takes so long load , regardless it first time or umpteenth time . while i could go unsatisfactory qualities this product , i simple reiterate what others also said ; it cumbersome use , slow use load , un-intuitive poor layout design , lacks many basic features one would expect this form utility .	-1

i've owned this software since it ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception . even it latest 1.5.1 $299 version apple should still ashamed themselves . i use final cut studio own 3 recent macs , so i've devoted apple say least . i am professional wedding photographer/videographer . i more than patient this software . it looks great , up apple standards design vision but remains absolutely plagued bugs . unless you pay apple laughable amounts money ( much more than cost software itself ! ) , they not provide support anything except installation ... even if there software update source issue . someone who such apple fan , i feel obligated let everyone know unless you enjoy pulling your hair out repeating tasks over over again yourself favor download lightroom adobe .	-1

first all , microsoft needs come down their prices ( not this ever happen ) . i build computers living , i'd say 9 times out 10 windows single most expensive piece any pc i build . said , xp come long way . service pack 2 wonders security . i also found it most stable version windows i've used date . that not say it doesn't it flaws . it still lets it share " germs " , stops responding time time ( hangs ) , it very slow shut down . built-in cd writing software terrible remote desktop not always pleasure use either . however , biggest problem i've so far product activation . pc technician , i'm always testing new parts . most annoying problem i've after you make certain number hardware changes ( let say you replace video card , hard drive add some memory ) all within certain period time ( 180 days maybe ? ) windows makes you reactivate . this becomes problem when you reactivate twice within this period time . it makes you call microsoft , where you convince representitive you're not trying steal them . then you read them long number ( i think 41 digits ) then they'll read long number back you you need type . it driven me point using windows 2000 again test my parts , even though this isn't always practical testing xp compatibility . overall , i feel i paid too much this operating system .	1

acrobat 5 so buggy i thought i'd give adobe couple product cycles before upgrading . should waited longer . there improvements v7 : better look , better commenting , ability add text actually prints , far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions way worse than v5 : some word documents easy convert pdf v5 not convert v7 , seems something font license issues . installation nightmare repeated re-installation required get past system hangs , clashes standard security software , endless errors automatic update feature . new product activation makes this even more pain because too many re-installations force you activate phone . despite my already low expectations adobe , this product disappointment . acrobat 7 , adobe , usual , charging top $ what any decent company would consider embarrassing mess even beta version .

office 97 pretty good product . programs powerful , decent interface ( maybe not good claris products early 1990s , but not bad ) , came ton features all one disc . office 98 release mac pretty much same thing . only thing really got annoying me office assistant ( paperclip ) but it easy enough turn off . office 2000 bit disappointment me . i felt improvements minimal ( aside bit more stability word -- anyone who ever used word 97 regular basis knows it prone crashing ) fact detracted ease use . one example clip gallery , which went one best organizers ever created becoming program wouldn't received decent reviews 1988 . powerpoint outline feature . i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space therefore made actual slide smaller . when you use smaller displays like i often this problem . menus , which hide some functions until you go bottom them , also annoyance . manual went nice thick book one half size . office 2003 continues making program uglier . now there many tasks crammed onto one little panel right screen . again , this eats into workspace . clip art system even more cumbersome , many clips online only now . help feature tries point too much online direction well . now some people may not complain , but what if you're using laptop middle country ? i feel program basically uglier version same thing first seen 1997 . fact , 1997 version more pleasant work almost powerful . my macs , i've switched keynote presentations pages some my word processing because new office versions platform similar . some templates also look very 1997 . apple programs updated regular basis , their templates look very modern . now i know microsoft adds some new ones now then , but they should consider redesigning many them -- such replacing overused arial times new roman fonts something little more classy . program bloated way too heavily . i run office 2000 comfortably 486 sub-1gb hard drive , but can't even get 2003 it . final gripe access not user friendly all . file maker better alternative , it easier use friendlier	-1
while microsoft tries very hard make office " think ahead me , " they almost always seem get it wrong . result package consistently annoys me . it true one turn off " helpful " hints otherwise customize programs so they less hindering , however bloated package nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody business . my opinion , office ' 97 excellent package , versions since then gone steadily downhill . many people , i use office work because i no choice . home i've good luck staroffice sun . while not perfect , staroffice read created files compatible microsoft office very consistently my experience , it whole lot less expensive . i am therefore hesitant recommend microsoft office professional edtition 2003 anyone except those who need most advanced functions excel and/or need use access database frequently .	1

i've worked pinnacle studio versions 8.0 , 9.0 , 9.4 ., 10.0 , this one . they've all two things common : 1 . when program works , it superb . 2 . other 50% time , it crashes frequently , hard . years , pinnacle designed market top , novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms , but some frustrating reason , they just can't seem keep bugs out . studio plus 10.5 no exception . lately , competition this market mushroomed , there better alternatives available same price . last , others emulated pinnacle platform while eliminating work/creativity-killing bugs . my advice ? shop around . google competition . but save yourself frustration steer away anything pinnacle	1
let me sum up this software " total junk " pinnacle give you one free support phone call help , then $25 next call . they give you free email support , but answer everything but your problem . they try blame it windows xp , you reload windows . i owned studio 8 , it worked fine . went studio 9 , few problems . upgraded studio 9 plus , after week trying make it render my projects no sucess , crash after crash , i removed it my machine . they sent me offer their all new 10.5 plus upgrade , hollywood fx , 3 their premium packs , hat says studio 10 it . this said program rebuilt bottom up . this program should called " crash after crash " , only thing works hat . if you feel urge waste $100 , hours your time , just buy this product . look reviews studio 10 , other studio products , most only one star . out over 100 reviews over 95% one star . i found one 5 stars , but looking reviewers other reviews he obviously employee , or share holder company . he wrote 1 star review sony competative product , 5 star reviews other pinnacle products you would not own if 10.5 worked	-1
i owned eleven vcom products now , they don't my business . product touts itself part vital tool when/if your machine crashes . if it , prepared shell out cost complete program . you told program already installed machine you can't run it-although this occurs after lengthy cumbersome installation process . sadly , customer assistance no help-emails unanswered you can't get through via phone ... what you get them once you register constant emails new products . thanks , folks . version 6.0 also much slower than version 5 . support 5.0 , way stopped abruptly when new edition came out , despite functionality program . price , software should work like major player , rather than dollar bin special .	-1

i don't problem software . it pretty much what we need but reversing error nightmare . before i start this tirade , i should point out customer service reps very nice . but they don't infrastructure provide most basic level service ( please , read ) . customer support system payroll upgrade this product really scary . ( 1 ) they want access your checking account pay annual payroll subscription !! ( 2 ) they not send receipts !! i help books small non-profit paid payroll subscription my own credit card . only receipt i could get copy invoice , which not formatted print correctly hp1200 ( duh !! ) . what really disturbing these people supposed accounting experts ! if you acquiesce checking account withdrawal , only receipt you receive line item your bank statement . they every heard " paper trail " . well you sure won't get one if you purchase payroll subscription this product . i start looking alternative intuit because they obviously don't understand some basic accounting auditing principles .	-1

i qualify this review saying i not own pm 8.0 , so i cannot fairly give rating , despite overwhelmingly negative reviews . i only relate personal experience norton/symantec products . i own used pm 6.0 since ' 01 when it still powerquest instead norton/symantec it worked very well , though gui bit quirky . i run it 2 drives , one 98se xp pro , pm loaded 98se partition it everything i needed both drives . trouble , version 5.0 , afaik , not compatible xp since m$ no longer supports 98se , we problem , houston . currently i am using mobile drive bay switch drives needed . if i get drive partitioning software product compatible xp , it most assuredly not anything produced norton/symantec , based these reviews personal experience norton/symantec products . i first bought computer ' 98 used norton antivirus 5.0 . time , norton probably best antivirus product out there . it worked flawlessly i used recommended it years . no more . i purchased copy symantec system works 2005 right after it released . long story short , i no longer use norton products because i got tired system crashes stability issues caused unstable bloatware system resource hog it become , am currently using competing product very highly rated but not common shelves big box stores . there one lone symantec product i still use --- windoctor , which not installed my ' puter but ran cd needed . adios , anything else produced norton/symantec . it ain't worth headaches when there much better products available less coin .	-1

familiar some adobe products , we opted try this work cheaper alternative than some other packages simple web graphics work . boy , we disappointed . simply put , this tool not so much tool , but hindrance . utilities such transparencies , not only difficult make work properly , but hidden non-intuititve locations . dialogs non-standard , which requires getting used strange layouts design . while seeminly small just couple items i've mentioned , multiply this supposed feature set product you start get idea how cumbersome tool really . mentioned plenty other people , it also slow . if you want simple image viewer , find anything else - even freeware , i never come across image utility takes so long load , regardless it first time or umpteenth time . while i could go unsatisfactory qualities this product , i simple reiterate what others also said ; it cumbersome use , slow use load , un-intuitive poor layout design , lacks many basic features one would expect this form utility .	-1

don't take my word it that quote title recent post excoriating this irritating increasingly bloated product slashdot . warned : adobe not learned its lesson , despite outcry followed release version 6 , this latest release acrobat continues adobe aggressive trend intruding into your desktop environment , again , version 6 without providing easy way undo damage once its -- fact , it now nearly impossible . like earlier releases , this version acrobat adds startup macros new toolbar buttons your existing applications adds menu entries your desktop " right click " menus . adobe argues these conveniences , but they entirely unnecessary ( most us " printing " adobe pdf achieves same result , much more convenient , more natural model ) , clutter what most users either too-crowded user interface ( those who don't knowledge or patience customize it ) or carefully tuned one ( those who ) . unlike many well-behaved applications provide obvious ways avoiding this kind intrusive disruptive behavior ( e.g. through simple checkbox option settings dialog ) , acrobat " option " disabling this behavior , once deeply hidden setup process , now almost completely absent . disable " convert adobe pdf " button mysteriously appears outlook mail editor , example , one sure choose " this feature not available " " microsoft outlook " option under " acrobat pdfmaker " under " create adobe pdf " . simply deleting button using outlook toolbar customization feature not work : it comes right back when editor next opened . similar problems arise word , excel , visio , project , internet explorer . there simply no way get rid never-used " convert adobe pdf " " combine acrobat ... " entries appear desktop context menus files ( even if one installs none acrobat pdfmaker features ) . technically inclined wishing repair some damage acrobat 7 , there complex but largely effective step step instructions available web , but even authors these driven despair version 7 : ( " adobe really pushed boat out acrobat 7 managed screw word royally " ) . short , acrobat make mess your working environment , there no way completely fix it , even partial fix pain ( not well documented ) . ( this may seem minor issue , but if every application followed adobe reckless example , our working environments would start look like strip malls , crowded features screaming our attention point where it hard find what we need when we need it . one great strengths personal computer desktop users configure it ways suit their needs ; no application should interfere . ) experienced acrobat users also notice this version continues frustrating trend acrobat ( most other adobe applications ): it yet again slower launch than previous version . fact , my 2 ghz pentium 4 , it takes longer launch than entire visual studio . net development environment , longer than boot sequence windows xp ! there other minor problems well ( arbitrary rearrangements menu tool bar items , etc . ) but these two major flaws more than bad enough . unless you really need latest acrobat features , you should probably avoid this upgrade . if " improvements " this release any indication where adobe plans go future releases , it may time start looking elsewhere tool digital document management . fortunately , there no reason all upgrade . version 7 offers no usefully new features , so you ( should ) avoid this one ( all costs )	-1
effort boost their file numbers appear more comprehensive , creators included many very low resolution images they " artsied " or " roughed " up dirty polaroid-transfer effect , or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides , which they must hoped would excuse poor quality original image . example , if you search " tiger " , you get 165 results , but only 86 animal , ( not one 20 images 10 toy tigers , or 5 images one tiger-striped chair-cushion so ) , those 86 , 80 crusty effect applied them . other 6 tigers taken out those same 80 images clipped out their background give you floating tiger clump grass or tiger head ( but , thankfully , not " dirtied " up transfer effect ) . out all , there not one clean image tiger its environment . here example . search " sunset " yields 247 results . these , 163 crusty polaroid transfer effect applied , 70 same images duplicated ( much smaller ) sloppy stack 5 slides . there two clean sunset images . these typical results . numbers don't mean anything ! this product stuffed multiple images toys , frankly not-so-attractive people hard angles , old low-resolution stock photos achieve 150,000 files . would it killed them include one clean , print-resolution image each category ? perhaps we could without 50 fake slide images ( talk dated anyway ! ) order get product worth around	1
i thought this would good product my computer . i didn't know only way receive this product over internet via download . during process prompts internet download ask you remove ( uninstall/delete ) all your known antivirus , spyware , firewalls your computer prior install . this leaves your computer susceptible when you receive error message . i received error message prevented me completing download . i purchased software aug 3 called customer support , they researched problem even took remote access my computer try fix issue . they unable so then passed me second level computer technicans . microsoft guards its secrets well varying levels technical support , those know basics those know more . they asked me set up time span when i would like receive call " teir ii " agents , i chose 6-9pm . i received several calls over next two weeks , all them outside specified time . i missed several them because i career life . when i finally spoke agent they again took over remote access my computer also unable solve issue . here it , two weeks after i purchased software , i still not what i needed . i also unable surf web because download process requires you delete all antivirus firewall software . i called several times druing ordeal " teir i " agents just told me i wait call , " they'll get it when they get it .

microsoft office handy . files you open , edit create it ( most notably . doc , . xls , . ppt ) probably closest universal compatibility among all your high quality options . it ( relatively ) intuitive . it pretty broad array useful functions . it also obscenely expensive , considering fact you get all these things -- . doc , . xls , . ppt ; intuitive interface ; functionality -- free . i hunted up openoffice two years ago when i decided several hundred dollars insane price pay ability write papers , make basic presentations , or put together spreadsheets . i looking basic functionality , but i pleasantly surprised ; openoffice most neat tricks , too .

positive pccillin it seems work okay . it scans email firewall works okay . negatives : - it supplies lot warning requests . this would good , but they aren't explained easily understood dialog so you end up answering yes permission requests without always knowing if that best choice . - even though it supplies 3 license keys program little buggy sometimes loses keys . if it loses keys it disables ability update or click customer service live chat button . process restoring key computer isn't too hard , but requires bit assistance customer support . - customer service slow . sometimes i've lucky gotten into support chat right away , but sometimes i've wait 40 minutes or more . support personnel don't seemed trained technicians , but just phone support people reading through manual canned answers . getting right answer take long time lot trial error . i used pccillin 2 years now . latest version definitely isn't good it previous versions . i wouldn't recommend this product	-1
i use turbotax every year i would e-file also . it says i e-file $16.95 it even says that all it cost one last windows . then right before it transmit it says $16.95 federal plus $16.95 state plus 2.5 percent what i owe some " third party " company , thats $25 each 1,000 you owe . if i'm paying some third company transmit my return than why am i paying turbotax it also ? so ok i'll print it out send it . it wants print out every worksheet statement total 53 pages . it no longer gives you option just print pages you need . i am now cornered into paying extra $90 efile or go through torture printing out 53 pages which i need only 5 or 6 . dirty trick . it makes total cost $130 . it would cheaper more efficent going good accountant . other than program worked even easier than ever before	-1
i used turbo tax past 3 years so this year like drone i purchased it amazon . great price way . well i receive product try load it find out july ' 06 it isn't compatible windows ' 98 . now i send it turbo tax refund . its great they doing but they should put something front box . after 45 minute call turbo tax they finally agreed credit me difference $20 purchase their online software . online software same exact program i purchased amazon but they charge $20 more ... go figure . it sounds fishy deceitful me . i never buy their software again !	-1
i bought omnipage 15 yesterday morning download , trying activate it ever since . after several calls customer service , forty minutes hold speak tech rep ( who emailed me two links don't open ) , i'm no closer able use this program . it seemed work okay few intro uses allowed before you activate continue , but even then it kept wanting reload every page i scanned . product might good one--i'm not fair judge -- if only you get it work . others pointed out , tech support expensive . if my experience any measure , it also worthless . customer service unresponsive , unpleasant , unprofessional . one call customer service , i asked if i typed letters serial number capitals o zeroes . when assured i , several times , she replied , " then i can't help you -- call tech department , " abruptly hung up . add irritation insult , forty minutes i hold tech department , i listened repeated assurances " reepersentative " would me shortly . not recommended .	-1
real headache began when i attempted " activate " program . i spent hours trying activate it , no avail . i got messages saying serial number invalid host other problems . now , i would just like get my money back . i used scansoft stuff past pleased it , but , whatever reason , omnipage 15 become , me , expensive nightmare . after spent many hours trying activate it , i still not succeeded . their support leaves lot desired . one thing , they keep " bankers hours " so don't expect get any help weekend or after hours	-1

norton old password manager worked much better . it pain use especially if you use same password serveral different websites . after using it couple weeks , most time not working properly , final straw it suddenly stopped recognizing my infovault password . several emails norton nothing but worthless repsonses . hours wasted trying get help their website ! even when i just wanted know if i unstalled product would password manager still work , no response .	-1
it time switch any product but symantec one : what once best security software company pc users now worst . it time upgrade my systemworks premier 2007 version , so i checked out ' 07 features online . but where password manager ? hell , i 187 passwords logins i depend upon password manager fill -- least 30 them day . after hour phone allegedly ' english-speaking ' symantec csr bombay , story i got customer surveys prompted them ' drop ' password manager . not stupid , i said , ' let me guess , symantec going roll out stand-alone password manager extort $40 me ' . ' oh , no , sir , no , no ... ' here it : $[ ... ] rip-off , nothing but password manager -- not so cleverly disguised ' vault ' -- other features ie7 provides free , marketed ' new ' online security program . symantec seems put more effort into playing marketing games their customers than they into making programs they sell work correctly . norton anti-virus mess ; it once-a-week wednesday night updates now joke : launch your attack , release your new virus thursday morning you'll millions nav subscribers your mercy least week . three times past few months , nav failed stop attack -- after several years never failing . systemworks too seems causing more problems than it solves ( i'm continually rolling back undo ' fixes ' one button checkup or windoctor creates , after ' fix ' crashes my system ) . goodbye , norton , hello mcafee -- or anybody else . this rip-off -- deleting password manager systemworks only regurgitate it this bug-filled mess called norton confidential -- last straw	-1
others noted , this product prevents aol loading my machine - it just stalls ( aol using connection via cable ) . it also " automatically " registers itself symantec starts counting 1 year subscription unless you cut internet access . i removed it machine ( toshiba laptop ) installed it my backup dell ( older pentium 3 866mhz ) . both running xp latest updates . it slowed internet explorer crawl locked it up when i attempted first write this review . it also slowed overall performance , when not browser , though this seems illogical . i uninstalled it ( it only norton product machine ) it left live update installed until i manually started removal it . fortunately everything back normal after removing all . this truly dangerous software those least my type equipment : stay away unless you very poor browsing security machine not choke it	-1
i hate rude but i building frontpage 2002 years . it so many templates features but i thought it time upgrade . i am thankful original frontpage still running my laptop or i don't think my latest sites would up yet . sorry , i don't mean mean . it may like other programs you get training or take class things frontpages just automatically . i'm sure it fine stand alone creator software but call it upgrade , i don't know .	1

computer i bought june 2006 came nero 6 oem version . it worked very well . i finally got around clicking upgrade icon ordered what i thought would serial number unlock some features . it turns out not available , i bought nero 7 ultra version , which required 195 mb download . dialup , i not pleased . i asked my money back . no response . i faxed bbb complaint copies nero offices california germany . office germany responded email they not refunds . los angeles bbb unresponsive . i finally got download computer broadband . i uninstalled nero 6 set restore point . i installed nero 7 . it worked ! but it agonizingly slow . i don't mean cd or dvd writing per se slow . when i eventually got it going gave me full speed my hardware . however navigating each click response felt like it 486 not athlon 64 . i think other programs also rendered more sluggish opening files . i uninstalled nero 7 , just safe i then used restore point before i installed it . i reinstalled nero 6 . what relief ! there may some fancy features nero 6 oem lacks , but it worth it computer working reasonable speed . if i want rip music track . wav file ( feature lacking oem version ) , it easier reboot linux run k3b than put up sluggish nero 7 ultra it . product company gone bad ; nero 7 definitely not recommended	1
great software ! until you question or problem . then you get run around big time ! zonealarm says they didn't sell it me so they can't help me . they send me broderbund help . broderbund then sends me encore help they won't help me either . zonealarm states if i didn't buy it right zonealarm then they don't give any support . it comes zonealarm box , says zonealarm cd but apparently it isn't zonealarm ??? ( according zonealarm is) !! buy it elsewhere , or end up helpless !!!	-1
i really like rosetta stone product ( although it over priced ) . warning : rosetta stone ( fairfield language technologies ) not replace cd if it lost , stolen or damaged unless you bought product directly them ( then they charge you $30 replacement cd ) . i misfortune purchasing local bookstore someone stolen disk inside package . this case i get my money back store i bought it but since you can't backup disks you better very careful not lose one	1
i purchased standard edition x3 primarily 3 reasons : 1 ) it claims ability convert pdf files into wp format , 2 ) it claims able organize your e-mail files through use wp mail well beyond capabilities outlook express , 3 ) it claims enhanced use wp word processing . what i found product met only one out three its claims . baseball , batting . 333 put you into hall fame . business , fulfilling one three claims put you into bankruptcy ! while pdf converter rather good tool , wp3 mail unstable ( this their tech support department ) . it destabilizes your use e-mail point making it virtually unusable terms reliability . i imported older e-mail outlook express when i installed wp x3 software , only later find out system crashed regularly . i could not get my older imported e-mail , could not find practical way reverse importing back into outlook express . what really irked me their tech support worthless rectifying situation . they merely responded saying they aware problem " may " release patch help sometime future . ahhhhh ! alleged improved " word processing power " , i experienced more bugs then appear animal planet channel special insects amazon jungle . unwanted page formating changes occur when i click my mouse page i just finish reformatting . undesired line spacing would appear pages . list goes , but who time more detailed . yourself favor avoid product . if you need upgrade , check out latest version ms word , you far more satisfied i'm sure	1
i can't life me understand why rosetta stone garnered such good reviews ( although i see few negative ones here , so i feel validated ) seems such outstanding reputation . i find it practically worthless , it expensive boot . i'm sure my experience german program would apply rosetta stone other languages well , they all taught via same method . i've learning german 6 months besides rosetta stone i used pimsleur , rocket languages , taken private instruction . obviously , private instruction best . but this review software , pimsleur best . but rosetta stone more bells whistles , which perhaps why people think it so good . but it isn't . example , nowhere rosetta stone you actually learn how say useful things . nowhere you learn how say " hello , " " how you , " what your name , " or even " where bathroom . " instead , you learn how recognize such useful phrases " woman boy ball their heads " or " man under donkey " or " these two fish same species " or " blue triangle bigger than red square . " ridiculous !! note i said " learn how recognize phrase . " this biggest weakness disappointment rosetta stone . it really doesn't get you talk all . you not required utter word . you see four pictures , speaker say ( german ) " boy drinking milk . " now , if you already heard word " boy " ( junge ) three pictures no boys , you simply click picture boy presto , you're correct ! this multiple choice way learning not effective learning language ! ( there " practice speaking " mode , equally useless , which i mention below ) pimsleur , which audio only program , you hear conversations impart essential words phrases . they repeated ( asks you repeat ) such fashion it sticks . example , it weeks ago it introduced " how much i owe you ? " yet i still remember it . ( wie viel shulde ich ihnen ? -- no , i didn't cheat look it up ! ) pimsleur brilliant way it gradually builds your knowledge abilities . course , it isn't perfect it doesn't explain grammar . but neither rosetta stone , rosetta stone worse because pimsleur there also english speaker who explains some things , while rosetta stone you left twist wind . that why software language learning programs should seen supplements -- supplements classroom or private instruction . what bells whistles rosetta stone ? you get lesson variety ways -- seeing pictures audio ( speaker ) , or pictures audio text , or audio only , example . there also feature where speaker program says phrase , you repeat it into microphone compare your voice signature speaker . but i found this didn't work well all wasn't worth trouble . again , phrases weren't useful	-1
pc user many years ( since 1985)i come through all versions ms operating systems ( anyone out there remember 3.5 ! ) ms also piggy backed this " robust " office product 20 years . their upgrades seldom anything more than better looking toolbar . this no exception , but this time i like tool bar ! ease use , i use powerpoint word often my spouse uses excel . if there easier product available we would buy it but then windows xp would kill it sight vista would stop working altogether . why ms think everyone but those working professional since ( hence office professionals ) needs all junk they subject us ? those guys redmond still think adult users pc like " cute " things like little doggies wagging their tail or friendly paper clip help you answer your every question ! i am tired beta testing ms products so many years but pc user i am stuck them until someone else come up better system , other than mac , we all stuck them .	1

quickbooks " sunsetted " my previous version , forcing me buy this horriblle , buggy software . it lacks many features i liked my previous version ( 2003 ) , runs much slower , uses 10 times much memory , full bugs . i regularly need run windows system restore when all my company data disappears . avoid this product all costs . time i used spend more important business functions now spent trying get this crappy software work . i used quickbooks 12 years , 4 editions , but this my last intuit product . i wish i could give it 0 stars	-1
i used lot software , but i not remember using much difficult use or learn than quickbooks . i learned it over time , but there seem several functions it could fewer steps . i would not upgrade unless i absolutely . program usable , but i am not interested investing lot more money it . it works my small business , but i could still probably get quicken , i not write checks it . i kind wish i stayed quicken . most annoying thing program i going credit card data downloads quicken , but when i changed quickbooks , it would not let me download data my quicken credit card , it wanted me switch quickbooks credit card , or ask permission all my credit card providers . i appreciate security , but since both programs made same company , this just seemed like scam	1

i've digital artist 5 years always loved supported paintshoppro corel products . i say i am very disappointed new version , pspxi . no problems download , but program crashes easily , you not drag drop fast 9 , basically slower everything you . i am photographer , looked forward new photo features , which work , but panoramas complicated work others than one photo forget it . just hangs up so slow you could go dinner . i searched net support wise , upgrades patches not helped . corel not solving problem maybe they can't . this not pc problem which they so want us believe . i plenty memory speed my pc . it may something involving how xi stores it cache . not sure . but changes not workable , sadly . i think there some corrupt files or driver problems corel desparately needs fix supply us , or they find themselves out ps market . this not just me talking , it happened alot loyal fans . because it could better than photoshop if they fix it . if you really want program , download free trial first or try or 9 version , especially if your pc older model .	1

worked okay until i installed xp service pack 2 . now i no longer scan using my brother mfc-9700 paperport 9 . it long time since service pack 2 released , scansoft left everyone who bought paperport 9 cold . i could not care less if they now come up software compatible sp2 . this kind treatment customers makes it clear they not deserve our business . don't take my word it . google issue , you'll find out there lot dissatisfied customers . now , i'll avoid scansoft	-1
i needed document management system . after looking software , there only appeared paperport . i read somewhere software becomes incredibly slow large number files . i guessed large number meant 2500+ leas t.t his concerned me , so i called pre-sales scansoft , asked if it slow large number files . he not sure ! so he told me call technical . i called technical , it his responses very slow sounded like he reading them out me . i asked if he reading scansoft website he said yes , so i hung up . obviously i read their site answer , not need paying international call charge someone who seemed less knowledgeable than myself read it . i got software . basically all software consists windows explorer scanning software . it worked well , i thought ok , expensive what it , when windows explorer scanning software ( usually free ) would nearly most it , but then after around 560 pdfs , it started running very slow . i thought it my machine so installed it pdfs new vaio 1.7 mhz , 1 gig laptop . same problem . if you click view pdf then hit return back , it takes 12 seconds ! so if you view document , it takes good few seconds but then when you hit back paperport desktop continue it takes 12 seconds !!! completely unusuable ! if you less than 500 files , it maybe expensive software , but more than 500 not waste you money . it runs so slow you not use it . i wonder how scansoft get away it - surely they should tested it internally thousands files	-1

after using turbotax couple years then using taxcut last two years ( 2005 2006 returns ) i concluded turbotax much superior software . taxcut only advantage it cheaper . if you take out price equation , taxcut inferior quality . - 2005 taxcut software there not pdf output all forms . this pretty silly because after couple years if i want access my tax return i am not going install taxcut again my computer view return . i would rather my tax return available some widely acceptable format like pdf then access/distribute whenever i want ( i don't keep my documents hardcopies ) . so i wrote hr block . this year they added saving return pdf file feature available . but unfortunately , this far perfect . it excludes number important forms - example , irs form 8853 , california adjustment schedule 540ca etc . instead it saves numbers useless worksheet ( without any data entered those worksheets ) , same form multiple times . - most annoying thing this software updating incorrect data . one form i entered wrong data . while reviewing it i found problem went specific section update . but calculation taxcut still showed old incorrect number . i just could not make it use new corrected number . eventually i restart new return scratch - just dollar amount corrected . - many section useful helps missing	1
microsoft continues their legacy software doesn't work . i've using windows since very beginning 2000 professional windows xp only solid operating systems microsoft released . you would expect this so called upgrade further improve upon this , instead it many steps backwards . btw , i 4400 amd , 3 gigs ram , say vista slow slow slow . prepared everything run slower than it xp . cool interface , only positive thing vista i found so far . searches also much faster , but hardly reason upgrade . prepared windows updates after installing vista actually cause once working drivers stop working . i'm tempted go back xp , so needless say big waste time effort .	1

they changed everything ! effort make it more user friendly , they've rearranged most controls . menus replaced headings . it difficult accomplish what easy changes before . some this likely improve use . word 2007 constantly trying think you , auto formatting you type . however , it often isn't thinking what you , making it obey your commands frustrated new headings . particularly frustrating , when i " right-click " list restart numbering " " ( ie . after roman numeral ii outline ) , word 2007 flatly refuses . my research paper now formated : i . heading . subpoint . subpoint . subpoinii . heading . subpoint . subpoint . subpointiii . heading . subpoint etc .... etc ... this ridiculous inexcusable ! i also individually superscript 130+ footnotes . somehow , changing font widows default " calibri " back " time new roman , " footnote setting altered i yet determine how restore it . however , if i open new document it fine , but i really don't want retype 30+ page research paper . powerpoint 2007 works well enough , compared older version . they added few bell whistles , but nothing gets way . if you buy new computer you're likely stuck new ms office 2007 . but don't buy it until you . it not upgrade previous two versions	-1
i made mistake buying two-year subscription . every upgrade slows product down . scan used take 14 minutes now takes over one hour . stay away this junk -- there much better free products available	-1
i feel duped ! i bought spy sweeper computer store year ago . it 2.6 version . first everything great . i got my definitions , it found traces , it detected spy cookies . when i ran definition update , i no problem firewall . every time they said upgrade , i . then i started getting renew e-mail . i months go they sent me renewal e-mails sometimes two or three week i ignored them , not only because i knew year wasn't up , but i also suspicious it just spammer out get my credit card information . i e-mailed them asking if their renew mails really them , voicing my concerns . i got ignored , when i eventually got speak someone , they didn't even know what their renewal e-mail looked like ! problems began when i updated latest version which 4.5 . when i would try update my definitions i'd get warning there problem contact webroot , while it no problem noting i latest version updates . no settings changed , not even my firewall which blamed them . i think it them not me since now it suddenly happening . they refuse address it . then i checked their site my subscritpion . i knew i one because i bought it store , my subscription doesn't expire until june if i invalid i doubt i could upgrade newer versions . what their page say ? no subscription ! when i wrote i never got straight answer it . then i told program corrupted , download new copy latest version their site . i . what i get ? boxes said subscription not activated . they knew i one they won't change it their site or give me explanations . after pestering my latest version now say when i expire . i've asked why it goes online scan when it doesn't need i get ignored . so i decided call but wasn't sure how because i'm different time zone . it took several days them get back me e-mail saying their mountain time treated like my eastern time get hold someone . first person i spoke after four tries 15-20 rings each , nasty , especially when i told him slow down because he mumbled . i downloaded what he told me , he said nothing firewall issue despite him telling me he read my tickets i t.t he second person sounded like he'd smoked one too many joints after he decided answer phone after 15 rings . he didn't know how answer any my firewall questions or why their page kept saying i no subscription when program it latest version finally admitted i'm current after pestering . they don't give you straight e-mail answers . they don't answer their phones hoping after 15th ring you'll give up . it won't scan everything even when no other programs running . new version it found spy cookie , it kept repeating same one over over despite my checking it " always remove " . never previous versions . i don't like company who answers questions selectively . i don't like company who makes you wait 20 rings . i don't like company who blames your computer settings when they never affected previous versions . webroot spy sweeper replaced my desperate search find spyware program actually works , whose staff answers my questions not mislead me my subscription status	-1
bottom line what makes company viable great customer service after sale when things don't go planned . customer service exists but their reps claim they can't anything your problem . their manners less than acceptable . rude seems " in-thing " this company . consumers , we options ; one which ge elsewhere . i am writing them off lost cause taking my monetary loss lesson learned . it too bad	-1

i fan spyware doctore some time . spyware doctor 4.0 excellent product . it it job pretty good without taking up any significant resource . but unfortunately it seems pctools not yet got their act together version 5.0 . first version i received upgrade version 5.0 build 172 . problems started soon my machine rebooted . spyware doctor service apparently no reasons hogged system resource extent 95-97% . killing not matter because application restarts after 15 sec , also it seems heart application . after reboot update started running bam came blue screen death . so after series reboots crashes i installed version 5 build 176 . but too not work , hence finally i reverted back version 4.0 eveythig works perfectly . please stay away version 5.0 till pctools get their act together . reference go through review cnet this product [ ... ]	-1

i bought this product because it combined number security elements . it worked fine until i installed network security feature . we home network soon i installed product , other computers unable access internet . when i tried uninstall it , my computer lost internet access . even using 26 digit key not allow access . customer service useless . they gave me directions which involved changing registry . bad move . needless say , i computer repair service fix network , i reformat my hard drive . mcafee assumed no responsibility problems it caused , dell nice enought walk me through reformat it wasnt even their product caused problems . i would like give this no stars	-1

if you accustomed using other versions coreldraw , you may not want this version . fact , they made many so-called " improvements " which i find incompatible other software i used past . it not convert encapsulated postscript ( eps ) files properly , crash programs traditionally work well eps figures . contrast , coreldraw 11 worked well . hence " improvement " rendered software nuisance . if you accustomed pasting figures into other software , forget it . coreldraw x3 not retain integrity original figure , it look distorted crummy . any prior version coreldraw worked well . again , " improvement " made software nuisance . top , it crashes lot . i contacted their " customer service " year ago when i first discovered these differences . i assured they knew problems working them . well , year later , no patches correct these differences , i am now told it everyone else fault ( software manufacturers ) coreldraw not compatible . i also told they no intention correct these problems because they not consider them problems . there example their customer service you . i using coreldraw long time , starting 6 , then 9 , then 11 . this worst bunch far . i am going back previous version .	1
careful this program . my wife bought it , i tried install it her our pc . i made several attempts , each time installation hung different stage installation procedure . when installation hung , i could not cancel or kill it , or even shut down pc without pressing reset button ( windows xp pro ) . i went support page web site , found faq item incompatibility zone alarm . if you're not familiar zone alarm , it personal firewall security product very common among home users . according nova development , only way get scrapbook factory deluxe 3.0 install permanently remove zone alarm . besides serious security risk , this extreme measure take . this seems perfectly ok nova development . they offer no workaround other than removing zone alarm pc . personally , this would enough give me pause installing product even if i not use zone alarm . you wonder what installer trying even presence dormant security software interferes it .	-1
i bought taxcut this year because it inexpensive included business tax forms my partnership . money i guess i'm satisfied partnership results , but that where it ends . taxcut federal taxes not integrated taxcut business ... ok so what you want cheap . but , it also isn't well integrated massachusetts state tax version , leaving me go figure how deal what it calls " special " situations ( unreimbursed partner expenses interest out state banks , example ) . overriding form data painful program complains if i override calculated data i not e-file ( not i would trust it e-file my taxes ) . form navigation hopeless . i only imagine what someone who isn't experienced tax preparation could accomplish this mess . i filed extension ; now i'm probably going buy turbotax actual federal state returns . deep discount , i would probably purchase taxcut again partnership taxes , because it slightly easier use than excel spreadsheets i'd using ( but only because i don't copy numbers spreadsheets into forms ) . honestly , you would think there would some tax software better than non-functional taxcut without overblown , fatty expensive too-many-talking-heads turbotax alternative	-1
" genius " educational simulation game , where you're building industrial complex -- plop down factories , roads , houses , fire departments such . game progresses , you complete physics puzzles obtain new technologies product improvements . you subscribe newspapers , which contain answers some questions knowledge or equations needed solve others . physics problems entertaining , well designed , well documented , implemented excellently , quite fun . they presented problems you encounter during business operation , example while developing new product . all information you need provided . game appeal children 8 up , but these physics problems more like age 16 up because they require high school math . so , children youths may need help parent who remembers algebra preferably physics -- yikes ! some questions easy fun . some require you comfortable algebra , converting units , applying formulae . few very difficult . fortunately , questions same each time , so after figuring out answers , you write them down just enter answers next time . sometimes game even gives you correct answer after it too late , so you write it down next time . unfortunately , i can't find cheat sheet list answers web -- too bad , this would really help . level difficulty these questions isn't problem , just warned . simulation side game suffers comparison . industrial simulation controls poorly documented . what each building when/why/where it appropriate/inappropriate how run game somewhat mystery . there no way figure out whether building something good or bad except trial error -- logic doesn't always help . bad decisions spiral out control , seem lead inevitably bankruptcy . unfortunately , wrong answers physics problems same effect . there " statistics " report supposed give feedback whether your company making or loosing money , but this form doesn't enough information . so , expect some trial error , some frustration , some algebra , some physics , some reading through magazines looking obscure clues . " genius " really fun , but could use some interface improvements . highly recommended anyone taking physics high school or college .	1

i very disappointed this software . it not really good anything i still haven't figure out why this even released . i own printmaster 15 , american greetings creata card 8 , few other photo scrapbook programs . this software templates make banners , cards , invitations , all stuff . templates few compared other programs then customize them , well you really can't . if you try start out blank template add your own photos you limited what you . no borders , edging , font manipulating . it just insert photo , some basic photo touch ups pretty much it . i wanted add shadows , edges , frames my pictures couldn't . fonts could only made single color . you could not add outlines or drop shadows , nothing . add font , pick your size , pick your style , it . you only save their 1 file format which course only works zoom . no e-mailing or file converting . what good this program i yet find out . i spend time make birthday invitation my own pictures . well guess what , i couldn't e-mail it my guests . print all it . complete waste money . this first software i ever purchased i returning . spend few extra bucks get something like print master , print shop , or something comparible	-1

i love printmaster . i'm currently using printmaster 16 platinum . i used many generations this program great success . i taught classes creative desktop publishing always recommended -- even sold -- printmaster , but this one terrible ! most images , even previews , seem online require download which very slow . thumbnails low resolution hard see , so you download previews just get good look . most images can't accessed all , because there prompt intall/program disk . there no such disk . there separate install program disks , neither which satisfies program . encore , which now distributes program , not support it . broderbund not not support it , except through its website which not address this issue . if you try phone customer service , you pay call get automated response which sends you response which tells you go website . not purchase this product without money-back guarantee	-1

used turbotax years no real problems . low rating due following : bought this store discovered later when trying download state it federal only ! if i known i would ponied up extra minor $ store rather than extra $30 download . last year state included this version - this year intuit new fine-grained tiering their product line ripped me off ! also , price this product way too high , lack upgrade path ( pay less if you loyal customer ) completely sucks . intuit almost lost me couple years ago when they introduced product activation . they serious danger losing me again	1
this program works after it installed , but installation process unbelievably flawed . if you version norton your computer already , this may cause all kinds problems new installation . not only i uninstall all versions ( after norton lets you install new one ) , but i make bunch changes windows , also . top , while you're struggling install ( i got it one computer easily , second some difficulty , third ... well , it several days struggle ) , norton counts down number days subscription . so if you install one computer today , two months later , then your subscription all your machines still expires year now . i don't see how symantec put out program doesn't allow you upgrade easily ... after all these years , they can't fix this major bug ? that just pathetic	1

i very excited get this game . i read previously written reviews . my 13 yr old daughter wants become veterinarian someday loves spending time computer , so this just seemed like perfect christmas gift . alas , game many faults interfere game enjoyable ! i should listened reviews ..... game extremely glichy ! it makes playing it very hard frustrating . my daughter tried one week given up . characters get stuck just stand vibrate screen until you start game over . sometimes she play half hour before it starts up sometimes it this right away . very disappointing . also , some internal setup issues actual cd it works better running disk then saving it computers hard drive . we pretty new computer , we windows xp - this program just doesn't run well off our computer anyway . we other games don't this problem . fact my son got game - building machines inventions - it doesn't any these problems actually requires more my hard drive . also , my daughter complains some limitations within pet vet don't allow her change . you pay specified amount hire employee employee this game slouch - there no other choices when hiring staff , no wage choices , you can't get this employee work or you cannot hire anyone else . overall because gliches game , she hasn't able play it programs full potential given up .... so idea great .. but makers should looked this better before taking consumers money putting it market . i cannot find any fixes or downloads online repair it either . big bummer !!! beware ! just don't buy this one , look elsewhere	1

i using norton anti-virus since i purchased compaq presario 4000 . reason i stuck norton because this presario came norton internet security 2002 attached it . i never used nis 2002 , though , but i purchased norton anti-virus ( nav ) 2003 which i bee using last three years . fact i used nav 2004 two straight years without any response symantec , then all sudden subscription eventually retired symantec . i liked nav 2005 ( which symantec six months prior its due date subscription , which made me mad hence my wanting try nis subsidized rate ) because like nav 2003 , it could tell if someone or something trying intrude into your computer . it after purchasing trying nis 2005 , i realized how low base norton go its software . first when i tried nis 2005 , it blocked all my websites . i couldnt access them i could not read my e-mail ( whenever i tried read my e-mail , response would , action cancelled ) . so i reformatted my hard drive nis 2005 appeared working quite well until i tred install adobe reader 7.08 couldn't allow me proceed . moreover , it snail slow allowing me read one mail . so i uninstalled nis 2005 installed nav 2006 , which appears working well . i now purchased tend micro pc-cillin 2006 well mcafee viruscan 2006 subsidized rates , should symantec pematurely terminate my nav 2006 prematurely i.e. before 366 days subscription over . i think one reasons why nis could not work it program it trying more than it chew . it tried anti-virus , personal firewall , privacy control , antispam well parental control one . it reminds days when it better purchase cassette player separate radio , since technology time could not produce good combined raio cassette player . i think norton internet security mode . it not yet competent produce combined solution both antivirus anti spam , anti-spyware same time . hence many complaints its buggy program . this stage , i would stay away any program calls itself " internet security . " i may try trend micro internet security which received rave reviews couple its users , but if something goes wrong my current nav 2006 . otherwise , i am still wary those programs pass off " internet security " such " norton internet security " or " trend micro internet security , " pending their perfection this technology some future date	-1

( which , itself , offensive obnoxious . ) explorer , course , wasn't working .

come one people , windows vista not only unstable it windows predecesors very uglu memory management really unsecure ineffective hard drive files management ; i've lost lots very important files due windows " errors " shut down applications even pc itself , so i decided my self : use linux or die microsoft !, i'm still alive ! ;-) i told you , vista nothing more but cheap copy visual effects linux users several years now ; facto , right now i'm using linux version called sabayon it million light years away windows vista , it visual effects simply incredible ( try searching " beryl " youtube you know what i'm talking aboyt ) , i not only 3d windows , but 3d desktops , incredible effects minimize maximize veeeery looooong list features you see it yourself beleave it . i know you might concerned several aspects this points wooried me time ( when i evaluating windows vs linux ): 1 . - my documents , happen them ?. nothing happen , fact you'll ba able open them modify them you please , oppenoffice suite totally compatibble your microsoft documents . 2 . - my programs ?, well there several options run windows programs linux , " cedega " , " wine " , etc etc etc , si it means you able run most windows programs linux . 3 . - it hard use ?. no way !, it easy use windows , you only dedicate few time ( may couple hours ) understand several conceps multiple destops , file system , users permission management ( one most secures world ) ( microsoft windows cant say ! ) . so , if you don't beleave search google sabayon youtube beryl you open your eyes !. so ... think spending this 400 bucks twice , because sabayon other versions ubuntu , kubuntu , some versions suse , other linux distributions totaly free charge !. you only download them burn it cd or dvd , whatever you like .	-1

this my first year using turbotax , it also my last ! since 1992 i faithful user hr block taxcut mac . spite it costing more than windows version , i used it every year except 1995 when various problems related my aol dial-up service prevented me using it . since turbotax only option out there people who use mac , you'd think i'd continuing use them now , - but you'd wrong ! i purchased my copy turbotax deluxe amazon.com save $5 . since taxcut made certain no information it software could ever imported other software , i filled my personal data i began . i little disappointed turbotax doesn't allow you skip " step-by-step " method , just fill actual forms way taxcut option . while downloads annoyance ( 6 or 7 separate files each time ) , most part software ok . picking up where you leave off wasn't always possible , but 5 or 6 clicks would get you back right spot . my first major annoyance came state software . after filling some data , seeing overall results , i wanted look forms see what they doing my data . i also needed see where they placed data imported federal information i'd entered . well , there no way see your data state forms until you're finished print them out ( or preview . pdf files print dialogue ) . when you software somehow magically creates state forms printing , but state forms don't seem exist anywhere else except print spool ! i found this extremely annoying , real time waster . final blow , however , when i got filing . advertising unnecessary annoyance . since i don't owe any state taxes , i just usually print those forms out mail them --- it doesn't make any sense me pay filing something when i don't owe anything i'm not going benefit " faster " refund . then i came crusher . turbotax wanted $30 e-filing my federal forms !! taxcut charged $14.95 $15.95 , but then they always rebated cost . i told intuit used , but obviously they decided make some additional money this year . earlier day i filed saw head irs cnbc interviewed . he said e-filing makes their job so much simpler . well , if it helps them much , they should devise way computer users who buy software file returns directly irs without intuit , block others middlemen . they should let us file free if it makes their work so much easier . while i my doubts services allow you fill out online forms , then your filing you , i haven't heard any security problems them , so that direction i'm planning take next year . far i'm concerned , turbotax blew it unfair their e-filing fees	-1
i using turbo tax since 1998 , i use computers every day , ( engineer ) i am used using difficult applications ( pro-e , mathcad , ug , etc ) . this years edition turbo tax deluxe worst turbo tax i ever seen ( i usually like it very much ) . i purchased january update 4 times . one update took 6 hours ( some us live boonies broadband not option ) . addition , application brought up menus selections not applicable ( farm income pa state form ) . when i tried delete entries ( federal level instructed ) they would not . my 1 business expense entry kept getting duplicated ( " copy 2 " every time i deleted it , it would reappear next pass through . every time i entered " state " tab , it acted like i never there before " start state " button always lead me through all same questions ( it retain my answers prior visits ) . where " continue state " button ? i also noticed using " back " button then moving foreward again caused never before seen dialogs occur , even though same " foreward " choices made . once i backed up check something then moving foreward caused my state tax status jump +$46 -$1548 !! upon backing up i saw some check boxes regarding sale my home unchecked . i not check them , but rather backed up two more screens , then moved foreward again two screens boxes again checked ! one more foreward click my taxes again returned +$46 . one years i liked best when there " checklist " so you could see where you what already addressed . this years state definetly worse than federal , but even dissapointment . i complete this years filings submitted both online , i hope i don't get burned ! turbo tax ! -- please improve next year or it may my last year . you realize 59.95 + 39.95 filing + my time + aggravation like this year , accountant looking attractive . if you " inside " you probably know why this happening ... outsourcing code gen india , not outsourcing code gen india , programmer cut-backs , programming application changes , archiving application changes , project management issues , whatever . just realize there problem fix it	1

i am not ' professional , ' but figured out how build website this program , which i bought thinking it going help me produce more professional-looking websites/pages , i invested bunch other money how-to books i'd ordered here , lo behold , server which i website i maintain my city gov't not support any sites made this program , then i find neither yahoo where i my personal site promoting city move their official website !!! i've apparently wasted lot money no clue this would happen when i finally put website together this program . i never would imagined yahoo would not support most current page builders , but it could they want force people use their wizards . why would microsoft not patch available or something fix this problem so this program used more than just my entertainment spending hours hours trying learn it build something , then find out it nothing ??? course , both server city website yahoo work versions up 2002 .... but i can't invest over-$100 old version now just . yeah , it great .... made pretty page , but only i see it . if i could publish it , i wouldn't just given it one star here	-1
intuit charges banks extra support mac users , many banks don't pay . so convenience automated transaction downloads impossible me quicken mac . several other features lagging behind windows version . some inexplicable reason , transferring data quicken windows quicken mac isn't complete or straightfoward . i haven't used competing products , but mac users i recommend either running windows quicken version ( using boot camp or parallels ) or buying product . all means , let intuit know their pricing practices costing them customers	-1
i agree all these reviews already posted . i getting error messages intuit stating i would not able download stock quotes after certain date , so i ordered new copy quicken $50 thinking it would upgrade . my amazement , it exactly same quicken 04 , no real developments . i feel very cheated intuit . if 04 only going good couple years , they should disclosed fact first place . if they going squeeze money out loyal customers , i would least expect improved product . they making real mistake here , their credibility now zip . i buying turbotax every year , loyal quicken user many years , but now i think i look something else .	1

i used this program 5-state road trip midwest , while overall it " adequate , " it some key shortcomings . bad stuff : first , this not especially user-friendly program ; there steep learning curve operate it ease predictability . spend lot time playing this before using it primary navigator ! lot commands not intuitive , you need go through lot menus figure things out . this problem when you road looking get somewhere . it doesn't lot clickable buttons main screen . example , get program talk you , you must certain tab bottom screen . if you any other many tabs , program doesn't talk you or show you turns . it took me hours figure this out ! help function useless . second , tracking very slow , result you easily overshoot your turns -- especially when there no physical street signs many areas country -- which happened me numerous times . many times screen showed me i lot farther go before scheduled turn , this caused me overshoot it when there no sign . third , " rerouting " function awful perhaps biggest problem this program : if you stray route -- even pull off get gas -- program flips out keeps trying route you back original route even if route not easiest or most direct . i not found way it manually or automatically calculate new different route . i also found no way modify route once you begin route ( see below ) . several times several different cities , re-routing function totally wrong -- spitting out names streets weren't even screen close zoom level . this really annoying glitch , it happened without fail every time i strayed route . once off route , there no way hush program yelling you you're off route , there also no way easily program recalculate change route . when there construction you didn't anticipate , example , this program sucks able change route once you've started it . very annoying . there no construction updater plug-in , which would helpful long term construction projects go forever . fourth , program not audibly warn you if you going wrong way one way street . this actually happened me , there no " one way " signs particular street springfield , il . though there green arrows screen indicate one-way , but voice commands didn't warn me i actually going wrong way , so i not looking screen , i wouldn't known . you can't always look screen when driving . iowa i35 , construction brought northbound drivers over southbound lanes . i heading north southbound lanes ( i supposed ) but there no visual or audible indication i going wrong way ! big time safety issue here . fifth , search function wholly lacking not easy use . i needed find police station while missouri -- no such luck . i also needed find state fairgrounds missouri ( which i later came across screen ) but it not show up when i intentionally searched it . search limitations second biggest problem this program . sixth , several times screen showed me " off route " totally blacked-out area no roads around me when i fact u.s. highway or interstate . something wasn't communicating correctly . other times screen showed me more than 1000 feet off highway even though i certainly highway . illinois , screen showed i pretty much driving through corn fields even though i u.s. route . this problem pronounced multi-lane highways . if you're not center lane , often program indicates you're off route . very annoying . seventh , zoom level not stay constant ; it fluctuates automatically high zoom far-out zoom . i wanted high zoom most time see all minor roads landmark indicators , but program kept zooming out every few minutes . eighth , help function joke . it totally lacking substantive information . program should come separate dvd movie showing how use it . ninth , program not recognize lot road name synonyms . example , some u.s. routes also county/state/local designation numbers and/or alphabetic name , but map often only listed one or two many " also known " names/numbers . this quite problematic when signs roads don't match up turn commands ( e.g. " turn left u.s. route 40 , " when only street signs showed alphabetic name no numbers . this also quite annoying . tenth , antenna comes program sucks . without fail , i would get red " no signal " indicator every city i where there high-rise buildings . this happened kansas city , des moines , indianapolis , springfield . if you city , you risk no gps tracking ability . yes , my antenna mounted recommended . one point i held it up through my open sun roof no success . eleventh , main-screen buttons way too small use while driving if laptop your passenger seat . you pretty much pull over or risk crashing see what you're clicking . yes , i'm aware disclaimer program states you should separate navigator operate program while driving . i'm also aware almost no one who uses this program actually navigator/operator . twelfth , trip planning lacking . when you input starting ending point , program gives you one route . there no way easily plan alternate routes or preview them . true , you things like program it not take you toll roads , but this function not easy use . several times program kept me off interstates when i wanted them , sometimes it kept my interstates when i wanted u.s. or smaller county roads ( sightseeing purposes ) . i would go off route listen program whine off route . thirteenth , i emailed list my concerns/constructive criticisms/recommendations folks delorme . never heard back them , which concern me quality issue . ok , so there some redeeming qualities : first , * general * gps tracker on-target . 95% my 2000-mile trip , i knew where i program operated just fine . just realize this program ( well gps general ) lot limitations , especially when there bad weather or you woodsy area or place lot obstructions . third , you easily add points interest comments yourself . i used this function lot mark places where i want return take photos daylight . fourth , there selectable function show high contrast colors ( black background bright road colors ) . this quite helpful . summation , money this program good deal , but not rely it ( or any gps program ) your * sole * source road information/navigation . if i hadn't my rand mcnally paper road atlas back-up state city maps i borrowed library , i would big trouble several times . there lot ways this program should improved , but meantime i'd still recommend it despite problems . knowing limitations i've listen save you time frustration . there no better alternative imho price . it possible some my complaints fixes , but you wouldn't know it crappy help function .	1

i upgraded version 5 . i don't use very many features . but big difference i see , files sizes seem greatly reduced . something i would scan 10mb , now might 2mb . this just opinion , nothing scientific . interface takes some getting used , bit different . overall price ($99 - less $20 rebate ) , great deal	1
software lot great things . you start basic work your way up more difficult tasks . system run bit slow takes long time shut off but other than , it great software	1

honestly , i don't know how much more they improve adobe acrobat . it excellent product , god-send electronic file management . i upgraded version 6.0 . only problem i 6.0 it seemed terribly slow . this new version seems much brisker . it loads quickly , files seem " print " it much more quickly than version 6.0 . i not utilize " one-button " feature it provides ms office other programs . i try keep all my programs non-integrated possible , because my previous experiences showed they really , really bog each other down , no matter how much their makers claim they won't . i don't come close using all features acrobat , but my needs , it far surpasses anything else i've tried ( or researched ) . if you're problems version 6.0 , or older version you just want upgraded , i strongly recommend this . however , i don't foresee ever needing upgrade acrobat again	1
first , if you're thinking using these photos print , you may wish think again . most objects run 300-600 pixels width or height , or 1-2 inches 300 dpi . stretch them bigger than , they'll start blur and/or get jagged . also note , if you try export/save image hemera image browser select 300 dpi setting , browser may stretch graphic larger than it actual size , causing blurring jaggedness right out gate . you need use " use image full size " checkbox when exporting images . if you specify 300 dpi size , don't use checkbox , you'll get stretched image . example , first image collection ( pocket watch ) only 384 pixels wide . if you specify 300 dpi don't check " use image full size " box , software stretch it 642 pixels wide . stretching cause image look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it web site or print project . all said , if you're going use images web , they're great . you get almost all images you'd find their three " photo objects " collections , each which much more expensive than this single collection . difference photo objects collections offer 20-30% higher resolution ( i.e. first image collection 384 pixels wide , but 492 pixels wide photo objects ) you save photo objects images transparent backgrounds ( while this collection forces you specify color background ) . price , this good collection . there lots shots minor variations , so it may seem like duplication , but someone trying get something just right , slightly different tilt head may just what doctor ordered	1
great sw , easy learn , good graphics . really helps visualize space when you see it 3d . could improved if numerous similar objects could selected changed simultaneously ( e.g. , windows , doors , cabinets get all same materials , colors , hardware rather than one time - very labor intensive ) . should warn users select/create style then copy/paste them where needed . also , difficult ( maybe impossible , because i haven't figured out how it ) change room's/house overall style once you start given design	1
i ordered box version amazon , instead download manufacturer not only because it less expensive , but main reason so i would paper manual . so many programs don't come hard copy manuals i prefer them over on-line help . program itself , i trialed download first . me , thing i fell love ability call up multiple images , side side , compare them ! it makes selecting best image breeze - huge timesaver . you also ability swiftly zoom check focus full rez . wonderful thing putting curser over one preview images , sliding it , slide all open previews simultaneously , so you don't individually zoom move each image . you this up 6 images time ! you also quick histogram check hitting " " key , which makes it easy toss off bad exposures same time review . while you've got previews open you hover mouse over them hit any # key color-code image . colors keyed whatever description you want . i " 1 = green " yes , " 2 = yellow " maybe , " 3 = red " no . there room quite few more colors after . i then hit sort key back main screen quickly select all red " no " images delete them . after i all my green " yes " images , i then review them 6 time give them star ratings . i resort rating now all best images top page i start processing them . you batch process file name , some other things i don't bother , well . it got some nice keywording ability you easily sync keywords your photoshop files . what incredibly nice you click any word keyword list all images you own , those keywords , immediately shown thumbnails ! finding image actually fun ! it even give you thumbnails images you don't even store your hard drive anymore ! fantastic program - i highly recommend it ! only reason i didn't 5 star it b/c it not all intuitive . this read-the-manual kind program , but you awful lot it without get too far book . ;)	1
this product so good . i love it ! i make my own mp3 , make disk copies archive data files . i'm curious see how dvd movies made this product . i'm very happy this item . price very pleasing well .	1
i liked everything this product except it little too slow times . i always shoot nikon raw format . it hung couple times i kill it after waiting 10-15 minutes .	1
if you decide buy current greeting card program , there really only two front-line choices : art explosion greeting card factory ( currently version 5 ) or hallmark card studio ( currently 2006 ) . there other programs available specifically creating cards , but most them low quality outdated , aren't really worth considering . ( competitive third product featuring american greetings designs sadly now long outdated ; designs american greetings program similar quality those hallmark package ) . so how these two products match up ? without question , if you looking quality " canned " cards , hallmark program wins . hallmark designs professional , equal quality cards you would purchase store . contrast , designs art explosion adequate but surely not up quality store-bought card . hallmark program also able simply correctly print several different types card store ( although you stuck choices pre-programmed into software unless you want much frustration ) . art explosion poorer job correctly simply printing variety card stock configurations . art explosion beats hallmark program editing options ( more extensive ) , amount additional art ( clipart , etc . ) included package . if you not plan use " canned " cards , then i would recommend art explosion . but average user likely appreciate professional , high quality cards hallmark package . personally , i consider choice hallmark package over art explosion no brainer . note versions : publisher comes out new version hallmark program every year ( 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , etc . ) same true art explosion greeting card factory . used many these versions , i find very little reason recommend upgrading year year . disappointingly , stock cards hallmark program not seem changed appreciably many years , same true art explosion .	1

i decided get this office suite after using it recently . i've usually worked office 97 2000 , but 2003 version some pretty cool features not found older versions . feature i really enjoy pivot report feature ms access , which wasn't ms access 2000 . this truly great reporting feature . you now use access front-end slice dice data stored data warehouses oracle , sql server , sybase other enterprise-type databases . if you're used creating crosstab reports , you'll definitely like pivot report feature . crosstabs limited 2 dimensions but there no limitation number dimensions pivot repor t.t o me , main drawback price . ( i get mine around $370 jr , which great price . ) i figure i upgrade this 5 years time , which works out $70 $75 per year ( assuming i'll paying $370 upgrade 5 years time . ) big positive this industry standard . so work you put into learning multiple new features word , excel , ms access not wasted because you reuse same skills job . your time well spent . note software may seem bloated but intelligent user able choose pick most useful relevant features each application ignore features not useful . different features useful different people ... positive : each product office professional fully programmable using visual basic applications ( vba ) which you use build custom programs . this very powerful feature sometimes overlooked when shopping office suites .	1

( they use trend micro virus protection ) program allows simple maintenance or more experienced users indepth tools allow you maintain tweak your system . there lot extra programs come this software i not install after reading some reviews warnings using them . however , my personal experience after installing just system suit 6 professional really good me . i bought my copy walmart filled out rebate following instructions carefully i received my rebate after 6 weeks . i hope if anyone buys this software because my recommendation similar results . i would rate my knowledge computers above average , which may why i not any problems software .	1

i won't include my website url here , but i'm professional photographer , who displays sells his work juried exhibitions . i've using photoshop since version 5.0 , roughly 6-7 years . frankly , i'm surprised see how many negative reviews there here photoshop cs2 , overall product only gets three stars . i understand all frustration , though . even top-of-the-line machine , " ps cs2 " slow times . however , my case , that because i'm working incredibly large files . example , my camera / scanner combination typically produces 50 megapixel images . time multiple layers added ps , one image file 500 mb - 1 gb size . this exactly why i dual-opteron system 4 gb ram : so i work these monster files photoshop ! me , photoshop must-have . there * no * alternative programs me consider handle my files what i want get . i don't even want mention all advanced features i use daily basis , frankly because that part my edge professional . i've spent over five years working ps everyday , carefully studied several advanced books ps . learning curve long , but rewards great if you high goals high standards . yeah , adobe got some major improvements make , lines other reviewers mentioned . me , only real problem poor often wasteful use system memory . i would agree other reviewers here most people , full photoshop cs2 probably waste money . photoshop elements probably better way go , though i haven't used it personally . i know good web designer who uses paint shop pro , who seems happy . imho , some people probably drawn photoshop way others drawn autocad or solidworks or 3d studio max . all these programs incredibly powerful tools support entire career if one puts time effort become true expert user . you can't make career out ps elements , or paint shop pro , or gimp , or whatever else other reviewers may mention . ps cs2 " standard " image manipulation	1

you see other reviews above , studio series history buggy . you also hear lot people saying " this package so much more intuitive easy use than other ' powerful enough worth owning ' packages -- if only it more stable ! " i am one those long-suffering users ( 5 years , going back version 9 ) , finally version 10.6 i stopped complaining -- it now works i'd hoped when i bought it . $300 i spent other packages trying better wasted -- i kept getting frustrated interfaces 500-page manual couldn't clarify . i'm very sophisticated computer user most measures . i am turning all our old family video tapes cd into dvd . i use studio all editing ( not tried dvd recording -- just use roxio ) am now very pleased . if you own 10.5 then version 10.6 free download . one important piece advice would saved me lots problems : put every " project " you work separate subdirectory . if you 5 soccer game videos make /game1 , /game2 etc . series subfolders . if you edit those " jimmy great plays " proect , put it separate /jimmyplays folder . when projects same folder you edit them few times weird overwrite problems happen 10.5 . i learned this trick before 10.6 came out , i don't know if it matters any more but i take no chances . why i stick something where i admit version 9.0 " powerful but unstable " 10.0 " more powerful more unstable " ? because i actually use studio minimal reference instructions , when i use it things turn out i expect . now it become stable reliable i am very satisfied customer . so that how i got frustrated studio customer giving it 4 stars this review . i tell whole story so you understand other reviews frustrated people relevant older versions , but " 10.5 updated free 10.6 " really best choice out there now ... my unused expensive rivals studio my shelf prove . just keep putting every project inn its own folder !	1

far gps software goes , there nothing better available than streets trips autoroute . there dozens features you can't find self-contained gps units . it easy add multiple stops optimize them into best order , night-view great feature , topographical maps . new feature offered this year , easy-linking satellite photos places map , also welcome addition . only reason i'm giving it four because following : 1 ) there still no ground-level or 3d view roads use gps function2 ) they still haven't added option exclude roads ban trucks or commercial traffic form using them . 3 ) there isn't lot coverage eastern european countries , most notably , nothing russia . nonetheless , it still better than any other gps software market	1
those already familiar , i excited this edition when it advertised it now works raw files . this one advantages adobe photoshop elements . i nikon digital slr i often shoot raw convert . jpg if i want edit microsoft digital imaging . when i went out buy this " anniversary " edition , very small print it reads it same previous 2006 edition " except " support raw files no longer included . still , it sale ($24 ) i thought upgrade would cool . when i used it , i saw little or no difference this than microsoft digital image 10 i already using . my opinion , upgrading 10 isn't worth it . those new this product , let me start saying , i've long time user microsoft digital imaging products . i enjoy bright , clean look interface . more , i love how simple it use . i would recommend microsoft digital image all skill levels , but especially anyone who just starting out digital photography computers . hands down , it easiest . it one step what would take three photoshop elements . you sacrifice come control , but simplicity focus this program . adobe photoshop elements more powerful , but harder use . bottom line , if you want concentrate getting out taking good pictures instead spending lots time editing , get microsoft digital imaging . average shutterbug , it'll edit just good photoshop elements less time less money .	1

not sure how i got it , but i got browser hijacker adaware spybot wouldn't get rid . top i got trojan these programs my avast antivirus wouldn't get rid . so out desperation something quickly , i went . buy bought this $40 . they didn't large selection , so i put down money it . imagine my feeling when i saw it amazon $20 . still this product works well . it made me uninstall spybot , adaware , turn off my windows firewall install it . you install it 3 different computers , or it asked you switch your license one them , should you install it fourth time . so you install it more than 3 times , you jsut switch your lisenses .. understand ? product works very well got rid my problems . you get updates 1 year , then you renew . i think this stupid personally , but its trend now days . its rip ... you pay $40 spyware or virus protection it should good more than year . several annoying windows pop up time time asking me what i want it . i wish there some default user setting so program could it . firewall slows down your connection , but they all . i 3mg dsl my speed test down around 1300k , so i've lost alot bandwith . i guess its worth protection . before spybot adaware , spyscans would typically find 25+ issues spyware . now trend micro , i find only 5 10 issues my weekely scan . so i'm happy product , except my decrease dsl speed	1

this 3 copy version norton av . ( one cd create three copies ) i purchased it save money it less than $20 per copy . i bought it replace nav 2006 same three computers which expired . installed easily two machines . just uninstall 2006 install 2007 . first machine more difficult . there evidently some conflicting software computer i use msconfig " clean boot " per norton web site instructions . i kept running into " blue screen death " previous installs when i would get actual install norton av . each time i would uninstall program more . but all help came symantec ( norton ) website . it now working fine . added : my personal preference not use software firewalls . i use router nat hardware firewall . ( it only blocks unauthorized incoming malware ) software firewalls try tell you everything leaving your computer generally you either become paranoid or just shut thing off . they intended look malware behavior . antivirus programs look malware signature . only advantage finding malware behavior if computer attacked first day or two malware existence . if one antivirus program it eventually ( within few days ) find problem software firewall trying tell someone . ( assuming they haven't given up yet too many cries wolf ) . so only software firewall i ( microsoft os firewall ) turned off thus i haven't same problem others report . practice i sent junk email directly trash avoid weird websites . so far no problems malware .	1
nero 7 original version useless it prevented you burning some things ; mysteriously nero suddenly undone itself . all now changed new update . it so good you now burn anything vista . nero inc also released " nero 7 cleantool " removing bad installs . if you trouble nero 7 vista then cleantool fix it . apply tool . clean install . nero 7 99.9% effective but tendency corrupt now again simply because it vast configuration system . nero core burning tool . this means several backup packages out there actually find nero install use it burning . one example dvdshrink runs nero background while backing up dvd movies dvd-r . i/o errors these programs , including dvd decrypter , usually result configuration problem nero . one example updating your firmware . sometimes this requires you reinstall nero . this problem however only bug i found nero . just side - i highly recommend either sony , imation , memorex , verbatim relatively cheap good second class media ( 80% or higher burn success rate ) . dvd still its early days development some media garbage so don't blame nero if you make coasters ( half burned dvd-r discs useless you ) this software . i also recommend healthy supply least 3 dvd-rw discs testing your burning so you never make coaster waste money . okay , now back nero . nero burning rom real tool bundle . it most configurable burning tool package while nero express those who not know thing burning works like wizard . word advice stick rom learn it without using wizard . you choose dozens cd formats dozens dvd formats , including several variations each format . image burning hybrid discs any time all here . there not disc format you cannot burn this program . burner hardware based error correction systems conjunction nero software make perfect burn almost every time . nero also happens extremely fast , if not fastest out there , however fast also terms how fast your burner , but software package requires little no processing before 8gb dvd pulled onto your hd . you create isos nero even use nero open up isos so you read content ) . there amazing amount free software out there uses this burner their base rightly so . it best burning software out there this time writing . pros : - if you learn tutorials all types backups then this dvd burner change your life if you play games watch movies . - solid performance . good hardware media almost flawless burns every time . - nice configuration . even backup your ps xbox games . - all burning formats . - 266mb size . cons : - let face it . dvd burning backup bit learning curve . read plenty tutorials use nero specific backups . - corrupts sometimes needs cleaning before reinstall . - you really need top range machine backup dvd less than hour	1

our photo video editing softwares both very basic " old " , so we decided upgrade couple months ago . after reading many reviews different bundles , we decided get adobe photoshop elements 5.0 premiere elements 3.0 bundle . we've played around premiere elements bit , it really awesome . much better than pinnacle studio 8 we before . all basic functions easy use very intuitive , though we haven't gone figured out more advanced features yet . photoshop elements wonderful tool , well . we recently scan lot old pictures ( 20+ year old b/w photographs ) . they needed lot touching up , elements 5.0 worked wonderfully . i could adjust lighting sharpening , fix colors scratches , pictures turned out amazing . you'd never able tell they scanned images such old photographs . program also very intuitive . i could all things i wanted without read manual . course , i'm still just touching surface what all possible , i plan reading manual studying program more detail once i time so , but what i need right now , it easy use good job . there only two things i comment i don't like adobe bundle , they reason why i'm giving 4 stars instead 5.1 . stated minimum requirements this bundle 512mb ram . that what we our computer , while program worked , it so painfully slow it wasn't feasible really use it . we ended up upgrading 1gb , it working great since . so if you less than 1gb ram , make sure you upgrade before getting this software ! 2 . red-eye fix photoshop elements , or lack thereof . there auto red-eye fix , but it doesn't work very well . it finds red eyes all kinds places , just not where they actually . sometimes it covers half face , sometimes only half eye , etc . etc . etc . there option manually show program where red eye , but it still doesn't work right . maybe there trick i haven't found out yet , but right now , i usually give fix tool shot , if it doesn't work i take picture back into my old editing software fix red eye there . i'm really very disappointed this , fixing red eyes something you quite frequently when editing pictures . overall , software very easy fun work , even amateur like me . :o ) if adobe adjust minimum requirements recommendation fix red-eye fix tool , it going definitely deserve 5 points	1

i purchased this bible study set use my palm lifedrive . it works perfectly this device . truly , it exactly what i wanted . it should noted niv bible - other translations set - obscure god name ( yhwh ) . this makes it easy mainstream nominal christians attribute jesus almighty god - instead simply only begotten son almighty god . but translations otherwise rather good - tools offered this software set make it well worth money . after all , god judge hearts intentions rather than technical errors man trying understand him . jesus preached love even our enemies rather than legalistic jargon . it would great if set included interlinear ( word word translation ) both old new testaments . would very great addition ; but it would doubled cost . if such becomes available i gladly pay price	1
i really like this program . i purchased three different bible programs my pda this one far best three .	1

i've using norton antivirus 2002 annual updates patches forever norton internet security 2003 . now it time renewal norton antivirus , i thought i switch trend micro internet secuirty 2005 after all glowing wins it received certain mainstream computer magazines . i like norton 2002 but it memory resident hog taskmanager considering i running p3 500 laptop 196mb winxp pro , resources valuable . also newer norton antivirus version hit miss . after also reading reviews amazon , i took plunge trend micro . my review this product best summarize it relations norton antivirus 2002 ( updated ) . pros trend micro 2005:1 . fastest virus scan i've seen . i not find any virus my system yet whereas norton would fail . 01% time ( i.e. one stalling virus every year ) . 2 . check incoming outgoing mail like norton3 . scan selected files i chose just like norton4 . alert block virus threats5 . monitor nearby wifi connection6 . $25 mail rebate making price net $15 . ( it 2 months since i've mailed it not received it yet ) . 7 . uses 10mb system background resources versus norton 30mb . cons against trend micro 2005:1 . very annoying auto-virus update every day i log internet . i only 56k connection updating takes 5 minutes . i'm not trying save internet but everyday update may bit too much so i would prefer preference setting i choose myself . norton not annoying . 2 . wifi network , trend micro firewall failed 5 gibson research shields up test . ports open . norton internet firewall close all major holes except non-critical ones which wasn't big worry . i ended up disabling trend micro firewall using norton firewall instead it full software much better analysis deeper protection . 3 . anti-spam data protection subpar i got advertisements pop-up certain websites like west cost major newspaper . using norton firewall stops them dead ; never seen them again . 4 . still waiting rebate . overall , i think using trendmicro internet security 2005 it fast virus check separate norton internet firewall ideal combo me . it own merit , trend micro would perfect only if ram other resources low case my laptop but i wouldn't mind using norton if i plentiful more ram .	1
this fantastic product . it endless applications . i absolutly love it	1

i put this review because unfair one previously given . before i purchased this software , i checked out 5-6 major fish screensavers out their this one far most realistic , ( movement , background , lighting , noise ) . i two computers , one 800 mhz other 1.4 ghz processor program runs perfect both . goldfish screensaver just impressive , if you're into kind fish . don't let other marine/freshwater screen savers fool you advertising more fish backgrounds , quality all aspects , especially 3d-graphics color ( which must if your looking realism ) , poor . i personally thought i'd like extra fish backgrounds ( turtles particular ) competitors screen saver , so i purchased it instead this one . after trying it , i very disapointed luckily i able receive refund . i purchased marine aquariun never regretted it since . what great they demo their website your try out too	1

over all i am very happy product . it paid itself this short time just making happy birthday cards . i am not totally happy product i am not sure if i would buy it again . product well worth money you paying but their few things which i am not happy : 1 . even though product gives you cd which contain art project models their more art projects internet . access these art projects you need go internet which not problem . what problem if you want get this site lot other people site already you may not able get site . if you cannot get site you cannot finish your project . you put it away until some other time when you get site . this frustrating annoying . it makes you want take entire program through it out window buy brand . 2 . other thing i not happy , i given coupon , box , 1 year membership " million image club " get into this club you fill out some paperwork submit it internet . after it reviewed you then sent pass word , over internet , allows you go site . well , i filled out all paperwork , sent it over internet , required , but not sent password . well , i tried find some one talk this but ran into brick wall after spending lot time directed one site only end up no answer problem . it seems broderbund not control product but " encore " . you receive almost no help all " encore " . only place get help forum which couldn't give reasonable answer what i should . so , i am now not getting access " million image club " , tell you truth , i don't really care . when you finally get site you hundreds images models choose . you really don't need million more .	1
i chose office ultimate 2007 it seemed not only everything i could possibly need run business , but also easy functionality would keep me pulling my hair out because software or design issues . ultimate 2007 certainly doesn't disappoint ! - set up fairly easy : two disks came package . disk one contains most software disk two contains applications guarantee you owner software right all accounting key business functions . - ribbon technology removes old " hunt find " menu method ( although those us took time memorize learn location every buttom drop-down it take day or two get used new set up ) . - integration web other programs virtually seemless . - excel no longer chore it once because above mentioned ribbon . - accounting software included . - ink crossword . i'm not one games my business pc , but anyone likes doodle or zone out crosswords , ultimate lives up its name including art program designed pen users excellent crosswords . - onenote . i like post-its ( perhaps little too much * *) always used post-it note software my business computer keep notes . i used onenote 2003 sparingly because i simply found post-it note software easier use my desktop , but ... my tablet pc one note 2007 added new dimension my notetaking i feel work well my business : earlier mentioned web application integration handwriting text functionality . i may still use post-it now then quick notes or perhaps windows " stickys , " but long note pages , pasting images other web info , pen paper note taking makes this product invaluable . - word . what i say ? this my primary software tool i use it tablet pc . 2007 applications made my computer type . i easily click formatting tools touch my wacom pen i don't stop mid-thought make change or wait until i finish document then make my edits . - powerpoint , publisher , access , groove , infopath et cetera ( also included ): i am still delving into these , but they appear all perks other programs . so , i any dislikes ? 1 . ink program doesn't respond my wacom pen well windows journal or microsoft onenote . it also doesn't easy use tools within software . since it " extra " not my primary desktop publishing , design , or art tool - i'll probably remove it some point my tablet . 2 . microsoft not include instruction manual or reference book this program . result , after installation first disk microsoft statement all my programs installed , i couldn't find my accounting software , no idea accounting software second disk ( second disk , when loaded , doesn't mention software disk until after software installation complete instead mentions other business applications ) , wasted over hour trying find it . also , i'm " hands " person although i access internet whenever i need it , i enjoy actual book my hands time-to-time while learning . ultimate made enough simplicity manual isn't really necessary ( i.e. most questions answered " help " window ) , but ... hefty price tag , i don't think it would too much ask microsoft include basic " this how you install programs this what expect " booklet . also note : athough microsoft , through their downloads e-mail updates , provided " getting started " tab " how-to " each major software applications , tabs added " after fact " many you might find yourselves frustrated lack upfront instructions how use software . beside those few quirks , i fully stand behind my 5 star rating this product purchasing this product through amazon ( i.e. amazon pricing less than big boy retailers or online vendors ) . shipping turnaround super saver : 2 days .	1

i just used this program make wills healthcare directives my wife me . i book-cd version . i recommend it over just cd , because it better financial deal , you not read pdf online or print it out . here some features i thought worth noting : * program divides document into sections shows you list those sections , indicating which sections you . you resume interview beginning any section make changes point . * after doing one , you go file menu save spouse . this creates copy spouses names interchanged . then you go through interview make any needed changes . * process answering questions , program accumulates names people you mention into editable contact list . after you mention someone once , next time you need them you simply select them list . this handy when doing healthcare directive , which needs show contact information , if you already entered information when doing . it also handy if you decide redo portions either document . when working one family member document , you import contacts another document . * program not appear provide option list two or more alternate executors serve one time order named . only way list two or more alternate executors two or more them serve together . this ironic , since program recommends only one executor time . although i wanted name my wife , children , then siblings alternate executors , i decided accept just my wife son executor alternate . if all us die auto accident while taking trip together , then there hopefully time probate court name executor . it would just more expedient one already named . * i contacted customer support asking them enhance program add option list two or more alternate executors serve one time order named . response stated why they chose omit option ( " editors choose limit number fields beneficiaries executors prevent program becoming unwieldy " ) some options ( export document add language or return program ) . i disappointed they not embrace my suggestion ( i disagreed it would make program too unwieldy , since they already allow you list multiple beneficiaries executors serve together same time ) , but i liked i received prompt response indicated they read my note knew what i talking , they gave honest , direct answer . * end interview you review document it print . you then print it directly printer , or export it plain text or rtf . exporting rtf handy if you need change document ( they advise against changing it ) or print it somewhere else . however , rtf not identical printing directly . i noticed two differences . ( 1 ) pagination different , explained program , getting pagination right important legal reasons . ( 2 ) footer always different : directly printed copy says how many total pages , whereas rtf one not . if you cannot print directly printer , i recommend printing pdf maintain pagination other features . if you not way create pdf , get free pdf writer ( search term ) . when you print document pdf , print it prepress so you embed fonts .	1

this software wonderful ! i trying find good program scrapbook digitally many years . i've tried broderbund ( sp ? ) whose interface too clumsy , nova which rather difficult times ( many things you can't ) now this . when i first took this out package installed it i thought i made wrong decision this software since there very , very few backgrounds , templates or embellishements even when i opened xtras cds came this . i truly not feel xtras cds worth purchasing since there very few things them . but then i found tutorials included cd watched one making collages . i didn't get halfway through video - i figured out how it . i now created some best scrapbook pages i've ever made . within hours i beautiful collage/letter send my holiday cards . my husband first impression heartfelt " it lovely " . what so throughly convinced me abilities this software i take any image make it background , i create manipulate text almost any way i want , i've able create my own embellishments well using downloaded embellishments websites sell it ( . png format ) . i feel like i no limitations what i now . i imagine this software not sophistacated adobe illustrator , but then it probably isn't complicated use ( what i remember program rather steep learning curve ) . you also use eyedropper tool " pick up " any color any picture , background , or element ( read " anything " ) program . i able take background colors make embellishments matched ! i take color one my pictues make background matches . you also remove backgrounds photos - it takes bit time , but area around image transparent - this functionality many uses . you also save your files many different formats including . jpg file sharing , etc . there so many more features i couldn't possibly list them here , nor would you want me too ( too much time ) . if you only use premade templates don't feel ready venture out your own yet this software may not you unless you find website sells templates this software . you could start something like nova scrapbook factory deluxe 3.0 , which i liked , when you start becoming really frustrated its limiations it may time move up this program . you may also want read book digital scrapbooking give you ideas alert you possibilities . great thing this program it isn't just scrapbooking . you all your photo manipulation it . i always liked paint shop pro so much i haven't able afford upgrade my copy since version 6 , but i kept using version . i'm so glad i got version 10 it very user friendly too . but please know version 10 ( which comes this package ) not most recent version . version 11 out now . if you don't want/need xtras cds come this package you may want just buy most recent version buy some embellishements website makes . png files ( portable network graphics format ) or make your own . i hope you much fun this software i am . i highly recommend training videos cd - they really help	1

this good computer bible , but money , i prefer program like amg bible essentials which libronix library system built-in integrated other bible study software . $15 more amg program both kjv , apocrypha nasb , including lot other capability , like greek translations , word study , exegesis , parallel bible comparisons , etc . rainbow bible older issue shows its age not offering features mentioned above . some benefits this bible include both niv kjv translations , color maps , matthew henry commentary , naves version foxe book martyrs . various colors distracting times , but overall it worth considering , particularly if you like niv	1

i've used ati all-in-wonder remote make-shift media center solution before it sluggish , sometimes non-responsive . not so firefly . quick , responsive adaptive . i also tried cyberlink media remote . not even suitable prop-up bird-food tray . you'll find cyberlink tech support positively absurd . their primary focus ask you tons questions till you run out patience , or till they find excuse tell you they can't help you . firefly really rocks . controls several programs tools even provides mouse interface incase you can't get things just right application pre-defined buttons . if you pc want media-center performance it - i'd recommend this guy . sadly data rf this remote ; not ir . i hoping ' absorb ' all functions this remote into my harmony 688 but they don't talk same . i think snapstream offers product talk ir same purposes , but i'm not there yet . still getting my sea-legs firefly abilities .	1
i bought this package because i wanted good , high-compression universally accessible documents images my personal web page . ( google werbos ) . finally , after zillions googles compression technology trying many other things ( see my other reviews ) , i found something really , really works well , highly flexible controllable way ! what relief ! much better than acrobat 6.0 , other packages i tried reviewed . key capability lies " save " command , which includes " optimized pdf " one file types . " settings " there gives you power choose jbig2 jpeg2000 compression , very best formats black white or color scanned images or papers . course , pdf , they easy anyone read . example : two weeks ago , world top empirical nuclear physicist , japan , sent me set 24 1-meg jpegs 24-page paper . nothing i would read it , except microsoft digital image , which let me fix pages crop them ; adobe 6.0 , they ended up readable 14 meg document . no better . i printed it out work , scanned result 400 dpi good modern copier/scanner . it ended up 5 megabytes . ( copier modern " intelligent " . ) then , home , adobe 6 , it wouldoptimize it pdf version 6 , nice 2.6 megabyte file . today , i got itto 940 ( better quality , eye)in acrobat 8.0 , controllablepredictable way . i previously tried many , many other options ( including lots microsoft programs , all options ) . if i understand what i seen ... i could used acrobat 8.0 directly , without all printout scan nonsense ! direct control " save " command gets rid need all . what more , i just reduced 3.5 meg file ( best previous material ) 1.02 megs . ( best i recall , i used cvision before only got file 1.5 -2 megs . acrobat 8.0 seems doing much better . ) if you google lot compression comparisons , you see some small advantage cvision over older versions adobe image capture acrobat . but that misleading . acrobat 6.0 , i couldn't get better compression . ( maybe if i phd adobe , i could , but i tried hard .. ) . 8.0 , it easy . results better than cvision now , so far i tell . i certainly see no value all new xps formats microsoft touting , vista , now something so much better available . one caveat : published benchmarks say djvu format may better yet . i not consider it , partly because cost , but more because everyone knows how get latest pdf reader but djvu might stop people going my web page . but if google books popularizes it , i might reconsider djvu . but then again ... knowing what lies behind djvu .. we might figure out something even better ... eventually ... maybe future pdf standards open !	1

after many years same look marginal upgrades , family tree maker finally made serious change look feel product . there still some awkward navigation issues , but overall , i think this worth look if you long term user haven't upgraded while or just starting out . used available online services this company offers , i pleased find new feature integrates some online search functionality . although integration bit superficial , it useful made some my online searches their databases more productive . i think this big step right direction hope they continue add power this feature it makes treasure trove data they more accessible . too bad they not make mac version , i prefer this mac products available so i use it parallels , which not so convenient	1

if you're reading this . you want upgrade , your old computer windows xp professional edition here few things keep mind . first thing , you download service pack two windows update . so no need buy it integrated xp . these what i consider minimum system requirements : 256 mb ram . i found adequate more equals better . 500 mhz or higher . 7200 rpm hard drive help lot . if you're running windows millennium edition , or 98 upgrade now stability vastly improved . gone blue screens death . frequently asked question : windows xp pro better than home edition ? windows xp pro more high-end networking features most home users never miss or would even know missing . so most users windows home edition fine . they both based same code almost identical . if you're thinking upgrading windows 2000 , i , because i like gui interface better . but windows xp stable windows 2000 . so it your call . plug-and-play ability windows xp totally great ! windows xp default find most drivers video card sound cards , network cards , etc . such bonus gone days search cds drivers . i recommend upgrading windows xp professional or home edition . it great operating system some fun get it	1
i think this very good operating system , but it far too overpriced ! note person who issue disk #4 his setup disk set : try get access computer run diskcopy , if does't work , then boot into ms-dos windows 98se bootdisk select cd-rom drive letter then type " cd i386 " then type " winnt " then it start installation compact disc . i gave it 4 stars because i believe they could sell better operating system price	1

computer game version number devil closely follows book , kids progress through sections prime numbers , fibonacci series , pascal triangle , infinite series approaching one . nine ten games worked well us , but nobody family ever able complete tenth , arrow game . we understood math , but couldn't react quickly enough shoot down all arrows . this disappointing , because we could never reach bonus section . all all , though , this good investment child , 8 or up , who loves or wants understand mystery numbers	1

my kids ( 6 8 ) learning so much fritz chesster 2 !! fact , my 6 year old daughter started winning few games their local chess club after graduating this game ( fritz chesster 1 ) . today i decided play them ( since they don't like play against each other - they're still working " good sportsmanship " thing ) , i let them team up against me . i viewing this opportunity help them think ahead , predict moves , protect their pieces . however , i one who learned !! they surprised me again again reciting strategies ( move your bishops knights out , save your queen real battle , don't move your pawns willy nilly , break your oponnent wall , etc ... ) they learned this game . they also knew relative value pieces , but could see advantages making uneven swaps sometimes . example , they shocked me sacrificing bishop pawn order open hole my wall , which they later exploited checkmate my king . this strategy even 1 month ago would unthinkable them . anyway , i defer other more experienced chess players computer users who made specific comments graphics , dialogue , strategies . i am sure some point , my kids move beyond this game what it offer . but now i couldn't happier chesster fritz games ! my kids absolutely love playing computer games really learning play chess - not just " computer chess " , but chess lets them beat other kids chess club - not mention me . i think i'm going go demand rematch :)	1

i purchased this game my 3 year old who already reads little knows her numbers well . i hoped this game would help her learn addition . she loves play it , but several games require hand coordination beyond her ability ( hand cart one particular , noted reviewer ) , catching bubbles . it frustrating me because she knew proper answer but could not " execute " because her movements too slow . over time , she improved enough play most games level one . game very engaging ang graphics well-done , but educational part under-emphasized . game " teaches " addition involves frogs jumping lily-pads my daughter so focused frogs addition lesson hardly noticed	1
my 4 year old son received this christmas present . he really enjoyed playing it so far . he most activities without help . there one part where you ride cart down mountain click buttons duck or jump , which i think pretty hard little ones ( it actually took me couple tries make it down mountain ) . there many different learning activities : matching , memory , shapes , size , etc . we not any problems loading game our computer reviewer . we new dell computer running windows xp	1
rosetta stone spanish third major spanish course i am buying . i comtpleted all spanish lessons pimsleur series , also completed learning spanish like crazy level one two . i am one those rare latinas not learn spanish my parents . my mexican parents felt it would easier " assimilate " if i only spoke english . after going my grandparents ' home holidays only one there not speak spanish , after latino strangers speak me spanish then look me astonishment when i struggled just say " no , hablo espanol , " i felt it time me learn how speak my language . first course i used pimsleur spanish . compared rosetta stone i must say i learned much more vocabulary rosetta stone software . but i recommend pimsleur over rosetta stone , especially complete beginner . because its easy teaching method , my opinion pimsleur even better than lslc someone no experience whatsoever speaking spanish . pimsluer goes very slow pace . but if you already learned some spanish your own or high school or college , then you probably skip pismleur go straight lslc . or if you type person believes learning foreign language should more like hurdle than marathon you'll probably want go learning spanish like crazy . lslc covers lot more spanish words grammar than pimsleur moves quicker pace . so where rosetta stone fit ? i would say use rosetta stone after you completed above courses . it difficult really learn how speak spanish this software alone because you only looking pictures repeating phrases you hear . you never really learn how think spanish create your own sentences . so why am i still giving it 4 stars ? because if you already know how speak some spanish course you intermediate level then you add plenty more spanish words your vocabulary using rosetta stone software . one negative this course method tedious because software interface " antiquated " photos 1980s . sound quality not clear pimsleur or learning spanish like crazy . but if you stick it out through drudgery , you surprised how many spanish words you learned this software . but i think pimsleur better job teaching me concepts than this software doing . teaching me concepts , i really retained material understanding concepts , i am able take my own thoughts form sentences . something i would not able if i used this course alone . negative this course , unlike other two courses i mentioned , you use rosetta stone while sitting computer . difficult me because i am very busy classes , work my personal life . i use pimsleur or lslc my mp3 player not worry sitting computer . besides limited vocabulary slow teaching method , only downside pimsleur it not teach same spanish words most commonly used mexicans other latinos regular conversation . pimsleur spanish very formal spanish . we say " mucho gusto " like lslc teaches , pimsleur teaches " encantado . " our overly " macho " culture if man responds " encantado " many latinos may get wrong impression him . it not something i am proud say my ( latino ) culture , but it true . pimsleur not warn male student if you say " encantado " some latinos they may get wrong impression speaker . learning spanish like crazy taught me useful practical spanish i use communicate my spanish speaking friends family . when i tell people i learned speak spanish adult not home child , many them not believe me . i think they find it incredible two reasons : one , my accent really sounds like native speaker using lslc . two , i learned real conversational spanish lslc . i learned words phrases spanish speakers actually use when speaking each other . pimsleur taught me spanish author course thought i should speak , not spanish latinos really speak . one positive things separates lslc course others . so what order would i rate three terms ease teaching method : 1 . pimsleur spanish 2 . learning spanish like crazy 3 . rosetta stone spanish but terms teaching real conversational spanish teaching real latin american accent , i rate them follows : 1 . learning spanish like crazy 2 . pimsleur spanish 3 . rosetta stone spanish	1

i came across magix audio cleaning lab 4 years ago . once i got hang it , i really liked it . however , i kept wondering if there better programs out there . i mean , really , how good it $39 , right ? i recently paid $75 sony famed sound forge studio ( which sound forge program minus various some features ) . i spent lot time sound forge studio , working perfect my transfer some private music recordings cassette cd . i happy what i able accomplish sound forge . least i thought i happy . i compared my work sound forge studio same cassette transfer i magix audio cleaning lab 10 ( previous iteration this software ) . guess what ? i liked magix work much better . so , i immediately purchased audio cleaning lab 11 unintalled sony sound forge studeio my computer . magix could charge $150 this software i would buy it second . your going take time carefully read through full manual get most out this software - but it worth effort . this program work software costing 3 times much .	1

i aware naturallyspeaking over 15 years . we initially utilized this software assist people severe disabilities such cerebral palsy able basic commands understood . more recently five years ago i bought edition 4.0 . i found it frustrating when ever there any background noise so i basically quit using it . when i saw 8.0 advertised voice recognition software specifically small business atmosphere , i thought i would try it one more time . slow typist it truly changed my life better . only 45 minutes required set up speech-recognition files when occasional mistakes occur during dictation if you correct those change those right time , i never see same misunderstanding happening again . i recommended it two friends who buying it . it really allow you sit back your chair relax , drink your coffee dictate reports , answer e-mail or whenever it you might need . i can't think any $70 expenditure given me so much back such short time . i almost always my headset when i'm front computer because anything involves typing or entering data i used dragondictate	1

if you serious learning spanish this software isn't enough . you need purchase spanish-english dictionary - i like barron spanish dictionary because it came free down loadable software version - spanish audio series such pimsleur or learning spanish like crazy ( lslc ) . verb conjugation book good idea too , i like big red book 555 spanish verbs . finally , just like back day , you should either buy flashcards or create your own build up your vocabulary when you can't stand look computer monitor even one second longer . now here part puzzle rosetta stone help you : it very repetitive requires interaction picture/word association . i found this burns words into my mind photos help me recall word or phrase . rosetta stone also help you reading comprehension well spelling - long you use all lesson plans resist temptation just fun parts . but speech recognition feature not good teaching you speak spanish high quality audio series such pimsleur or lslc . advantage speech recognition you slow down word or phrase spoken . so if you want slow down word " mujer " you hear how native speaker uses hard sound slight roll last ; it great pronunciation but not effective learning how handle yourself conversation . summary , rosetta stone not one stop shop . it isn't mobile audio series your ipod . it isn't going make learning spanish thoughtless easy task . i recommend you buy this software use it but understand you paying $500 primarily word/picture association ability analyze your pronunciation individual words phrases . also , keep your spanish dictionary handy alleviate any confusion . whole childlike learning approach good , but your adult skills definitely help speed up process .	1

if you're looking create next doom 3 or half-life 2 , then i can't really recommend this program . if you want make advanced fps game , or simple pong game , then i recommend dark basic . fact , dark basic professional probably capable creating any kind game you come up . catch ? you program it yourself , all scratch . dark basic makes manipulating 3d data extremely easy , but it not game creation package which lets you click create . if you determined enough , it easy learn all dark basic commands , half programming game logic . dark basic hardly limit you , give you capabilities probably impossibly hard you use c++ . end result creating game scratch results tremendous sense satisfaction , especially when you share it friends family . although previous versions dark basic professional some hardly crippling bugs , most them eliminated , release upgrade 6.0 , dbpro very stable development engine . overall , i totally recommend this anyone who wants create game , but determined enough learn how	1

you probably read 50/50 reviews this software . used older poser software ... one thing i am fan miki terai yuki ... japanese virtual beauties if you fan japanese styled video games character designs , fact e-frontier now company behind poser 6 , i'm so stoked . granted , software bundles ( best buy it bundled other cool software ) , there free software out called daz3d . daz3d content creators make stuff daz3d poser vice versa but no matter if you go free program or poser 6 , result same ... expect pay money content . i highly recommend getting book " pratical poser 6 " because it very , very informative unlike manual . next thing ... before you buy ... mosey down daz3d.com, contentparadise.com, renderosity.com ask yourself , you afford buy content . content costs anywhere free over $100+ . good stuff costs money ... maybe not lot but it add up . next thing know after you buy content , due how hair or clothing conforms body ( or how it placed ) , they not organized . make matters worse names creators called their work long window selections ( figure , pose , hair , prop , etc . ) get cut off so , it becomes bit choir go back forth certain folders . but i got used it thing .... all developers content helpful . content paradise great place buy your content well creators websites well . there lot trial error i wish there more undos ... because really , although there undo ... you mess up ... you can't just undo ... you start over your your save file ( hopefully you saved ) . nevertheless , stuff i able create poser wonderful . i say i spent lot not just poser bundle but content . it adds up quickly !!! so , consider benefits you . although i love characters daz3d ever popular foxhair , i'm more fan poser but still expect buying content dax3d use poser .	1

compared fp 2000 earlier versions , it offered some major improvements , even letting one code ( gasp ) php live preview - it highly configurable , easily tied into sharepoint ( well , i think intent ) . it quite evolution , moving beyond fp2000 , some fairly advanced features - while still retaining " entry level , small business learnable " functionality ( albeit cookie cutter designs ) previous versions . i surprised find it even offered options strip out all code hinted this site made frontpage ( odd change , knowing ms ) , but also offered other code functions , some par dreamweaver - but not mistake this dreamweaver , even first mx version . it still aimed microsoft only - you really dig tweak configure it anything else ( e.g , php , cold fusion ) - but it offer some major improvements flexibility over previous versions . mostly good , some horribly bad . good - able tweak it dozens standards ' compliance , sec . 508 , xml'ish stuff , whatever . default these things not set up , so it take some learning . what annoyed ( freaked me out ) while it easily allowed desktop development access , create database driven sites - database remain public folder - ok , i suppose if you're using it only intranet . i believe point code access , then mod it slightly interact sql server - but most folks probaby not use it way - knowing history " fire forget " ease use frontpage ... anyhow , i'd call this para-professional version . it way more flexibility functionality than any version frontpage , ever . it also going bye-bye . there not frontpage 2007 , due switch expression web ( which retains some fp functionality , but " friendly " pesky " bots " gone ) . no more email bots , whatever bots - gotta learn how roll your own .	1
given my limited knowledge computer science programming i felt frontpage really big help . i able get website up running 2 weeks which i think pretty good all things considering . i didn't realize though frontpage isn't cureall making website really . primarily only web design i.e. if you want make website e-commerce query searches inventory database like , you're gonna need bring professional programmers any event program asp or php . but far web design goes frontpage take novice long way .	1

it basic job well . calibration runs smoothly accurately . hardware looks feels solid . my two completely different brand , size age crt monitors ended up exactly same colors sitting side side . user interface merely adequate . pop up help instructions better than many i seen . you need know already how calibration buttons your monitors work ( hardwired buttons monitor , not software ) . order make any edits you must run entire time consuming calibration over . sometimes you use " back " within calibration , sometimes you must start over . also separate " profile chooser " utility software , not add or delete profile feature - even if it profile created saved calibration software earlier . you see it windows display properties , but it may not appear profile chooser list . dual monitors one obvious reason choose pro over plus version . yes , it dual monitors , but asterisk . it create separate profiles , but only apply correct profiles automatically startup both monitors if you two separate video cards . if you single video card dual outputs , it load same profile ( last one you created ) both monitors startup . this quirk documented readme file installation disk ( blames windows problem ) , but this limitation appears nowhere advertising material , catalogs , or box . fortunately there work around ( not documented ) least my particular video card running xp . after windows opens , you run profile chooser then choose correct profile each monitor . you may use windows display properties settings specify default profile rerun calibration get profiles you want appear profile chooser select correct profile default . once it all set up , running profile chooser four five click procedure , but you must rememeber check it before using any application uses color profiles . check it after you open application . i've them change after opening photoshop - though not every time .	1

i yet make card this software , but choice ... i prefer photo cards , find it easier make outside card my canon photo software , inside digital image . i love stationery section this , however ... lots choices paper designs , it very easy use . i just can't figure out how make text larger , if you . when you're typing up your letter , it large text ; when you print your letter it small text . making envelope easy , too ... it only easy software i ! only , i go my control panel click my canon printer properties change paper type envelope . hallmark software doesn't allow this -- least not envelopes directly follow stationery printing , although it allows it when printing your letter . if i don't change canon envelope , i'm left ink tracks my envelopes . ( there separate envelope category , however , i haven't used . maybe one brings up printer properties . ) there loads fun projects this software , it very colorful software . installation ... mine nightmare . disc 1 only one would download . other two just froze my pc . i discovered i changing discs too quick . if i waited least few minutes changing discs it installed fine . i almost gave up it , however , but am glad i didn't	1

any e-dictionary give you definitions course , but what i especially like this one it lightning fast . also , when definition contains illustration it indicated icon which you double click view ( which comes up instanteously seperate window ) . this dictionary also allows you search word different criteria other than just its definitions : rhymes , homophones , date , author quoted , definition contains ... etc , etc . one note installation : make sure you temporarily disable active virus software ( it wouldn't hurt same those other programs right side task bar )	1

how quickly people forget pain managing raw images just operating system copy photoshop . thanks aperture ( its subsequent imitators ) managing ( interacting ) huge raw libraries becomes invisible easy . i specifically like full-screen mode , which puts images front center . likewise , loupe tool lets you check focus image without taking focus ( no pun intended ) away photography . you make changes images without convert them , then edit them , then hit save-as everytime you new idea . aperture completely non-destructive . raw image loaded adjustments it tracked seperately ( yet seamlessly ) so you never worry losing your master . there lot more app beyond these things , which what makes it such amazing piece software . its digital slr best friend	1

if you're one those people like me , who hang older version application waiting right time , now time upgrade . you won't disappointed . just ask editors both pc magazine c|net which awarded this version their editor choice award . once again adobe listened its loyal customer base . proof new version illustrator . many our requests answered latest version including some we didn't even think . i happy find out even new features , adobe not altered illustrator previous palettes or keyboard commands . there nothing worse than shortcut or command memorized years then it gets changed new version . no fear here ! first all , i want say i am really impressed live trace live paint features , especially when used together . we all know sometimes ideas hit us when we least expect it away our beloved computer . we end up drawing it out napkin , paper towel or unused envelope our glove compartment . normally , once you get back your computer you try redraw your graphic using illustrator which takes both time effort --- not any more . take your napkin masterpiece your scanner scan it . once image scanned , then fun begins . once image scanned brought into illustrator cs2 , use live trace feature actually trace your drawing . this feature actually turns drawing into live trace object easy manipulation . after applying some blurring needed , your traced image cleared up . then , convert your live trace object into live paint object using new control palette . i like live paint tool also because it reminds me working photoshop . once you've converted live paint object , you easily use pen other tools modify any points your liking . live paint also feature called gap detector which prevents paint going over into other sections because break line . this handy feature keeps you fix overspill later . when object outlines finalized , use live paint feature easily fill any region color . voila ! you . go napkin art matter minutes . concern many us years fact while illustrator keep getting better newer features , it also mean more more palettes . sometimes it became little unmanageable . however , pros adobe recognized this problem applied solution - control palette . this new palette sits top screen . first , it acts object inspector providing information . secondly , ( more importantly ) , control palette provides easy access fill stroke dropdown menus , brush shape , opacity , style . no longer you fumble through your palette get these frequently used features . if you fans adobe other creative suite 2 software , you pleased learn control palette apart their new makeover too . here some more new additions changes illustrator : * like photoshop , illustrator cs2 now supports custom workspaces . you display only palettes you need any time . you also able access or save any workspace any time or use workspace templates . * adobe improved swatch color integration . now , working other creative suite 2 programs seamless . * isolation mode feature allows you double-click group move edit internal objects without search through layers palette . * cs2 now supports all latest wacom tablets . it now provides brush support new wacom 6d art pen adds new dimension illustrator calligraphic scatter brushes * adobe bridge integration now part illustrator cs2 . bridge allows you easily manage images through thumbnails better workflow . * macromedia flash exports now available . you export both text objects flash files which result smaller file size easier incorporation into web projects . * you now open photoshop files layer comps within illustrator . this new feature allows you view many versions layout one time , just you photoshop * custom stroke placement new addition illustrator . you now place strokes outside , inside or center path . * underline strikethrough two over 170 new type enhancements . * these few new features ! $169 upgrade cost well worth money , just live trace live paint features alone . however , you get so much more new illustrator cs2 . upgrade now completely satisfied . if you haven't purchased vector graphics program , get illustrator , especially if you already owner version photoshop . this new version illustrator even looks more like familiar photoshop layout . loren elksgroup manager , d-mag.org	1

i'm interior designer interior designer 7.0 . it easy learn , but i already used similar programs i know cad , but you don't need any cad experience use this program . materials render well , but library furniture accessories fairly limited . example i creating game room client only one style pool table choose no accessory items such pool sticks , balls or wall racks . i've figured out some workarounds such using round millwork items sinking them into pool table look like balls . bed styles also very limited . i've downloaded all their bonus furniture , but it still lacking . fabric options also fairly limited , but sure scroll down past " fabric " find category " bhg fabric " . colors , scroll down past " colors " benjamin moore or download bonus sherwin williams colors . also best plants " xfrog " category . save time set your render quality low fast renderings , then change it back high place your accessories . program good job allowing you import your own images textures . show image tv screen , define it new texture your custom library width set 0 ( so it doesn't repeat image ) . overall i like program i just need figure out how get more furniture accessories	1

this system very good road trips . i just went road trip spring break it worked . i similar system back 1999 co-pilot . co-pilot system not accurate but some features should streets trips . instance co-pilot voice recognition could verbalize turn turn directions . it could also answer select question such ' how far ' ' next turn ' ... over all i am giving streets trips 4 stars because great receiver incredible number points interest . i would buy it again but just expected more product 8 years newer than my last system . i mean think how far laptops come .	1
i found gt legends very realistic game . plenty user controlled variables . tracks , least ones i could get , well represented realistic . while i found graphics quality good , overall presentation somewhat plain . i would expected little more " punch " visual representation tracks . i quit disappointed fact so few tracks available start . i am firm believer if i paid whole game i should access whole game no matter what my skill level . this idea find cheat codes play whole game bunch bull . finally , 3 cd hassle why not dvd option .	1

i got this request christmas gift last year , m-audio keystation 61es keyboard . combination two works really nicely my powermac . i didn't really start going through lessons until week ago due shoulder surgery i beginning year , but so far so good . record , i studied music 10 years when i younger , though not piano . while i still remember much earlier training ( particular , how read music ) there plenty new piano so i'm not feeling these early lessons too easy ( though they may slightly easier ) . i few complaints program . first , reviewer noted , you cannot turn down volume accompaniment / instructor . this makes it impossible me hear my own playing when going through lesson , even keystation volume cranked all way up . so what i play instructor audio once get idea , then play solo so i hear all my flubs faults ( also when i get it right ! ;-d ) . second , program seems slightly crash-prone running mac os 10.4 ( a.k.a. " tiger " ) . i've found it crash least once any given practice session , when i re-launch i'm right back where i started session . true , i just click right arrow until i get where i left off , but if i'd going half-hour managed get through several screens it little irritating . third , though not bug , how music displayed screen . reviewer noted , programmers / designers seemed feel 640 480 plenty resolution , but this means many songs you play cover multiple screens . " when saints go marching " took up 3 screens , which seemed ridiculous when i'm 1280 1024 monitor . yes , pages auto-turn you when you end one , but first time or two through song it very irritating i'm trying read ahead figure out what fingers need move next . but maybe most importantly , i'm finding this software , while it certainly teaches fundamentals playing well enough , still doesn't fully take place real , live instructor sitting there me . particular , i tell my hand position not completely right because when i play fingers my right hand ( especially my ring finger ) get sore rather quickly , like i'm straining muscles/tendons top fingers . i've got large long-fingered hands , even full-size keys keystation i find it hard get all five fingers seated keys without least two fingers curling quite bit . maybe this normal when you start playing piano , but it would nice someone there confirm whether i'm doing it ok . i'm certain live instructor would see anything i doing wrong right away help me correct it right then there . videos showing proper posture all well good , but program can't see me or tell me i posture problem . all it say i played wrong note or i held note too long / short . i'm hoping i'm not developing any other problems my technique , since i plan moving live instructor some point when my schedule opens up i've become certain i devote time serious practice . i'd hate develop some decent playing skills only find i start over because my core technique all wrong . so , five stars because generally good quality technical instruction , minus one star not able point out purely physical problems my playing . not program fault , but i can't give five stars something can't perfectly replace live teacher	1
i recently become more serious web page design . i looked other products tried them out . however , dreamweaver exceeded my expectations . i am not advanced user any means , so my rating might " new user bias " it . my first web site used wysiwyg editor similar frontpage . then , i downloaded 30 day trial dreamweaver redesigned site . productivity greatly increased interface very easy navigate , once you get used it . new web site far more impressive , user friendly , feature rich without cut productivity . learning dreamweaver pleasure . if you familiar web design , learning curve very nice . i making web pages within couple hours downloading trial . tutorials readily available help menu adobe web site . course , you always find good book here amazon . if price dreamweaver fit your budget you serious making impressive web sites , i highly recommend consideration	1
i recently left corporate america set up consulting practice which required balancing my own books instead relying finance group . i looked over several offerings decided i only needed track billings create invoices . quickbooks simple start handles these tasks quite well addition providing useful reports outstanding invoices , sales customer host other great cuts data . i agree other reviewers expensing business supplies not well i couldn't figure out way depreciate computer software i bought business . positive side , it very simple use given limited transactions avialable pretty much forces you it right . overall i would purchase this product again given it low cost ability meet my basic needs keeping books my small business	1
i find ad aware better than spybot which gets rec all popular magazines . why ? interface more sophisticated . spybot not very intuitive requires more clicks mouse what you want . ad aware more one-click solution . but worst thing spybot , during trial my client pc , it would not update . attempt update definitions file would result progress bar which stalled midway through . you could leave it there hours , process would never complete . this , fully functional broadband internet connection . after happened , i uninstalled spybot , then installed registered ad aware directly lavasoft . lavasoft baby first-rate program , important addition ad-watch which you must register use , effectively puts end spyware . diego , below , must confused . there never charge update program or download definitions . i used ad aware two years without paying it ( it free ) only registered get ad watch program protect my elderly parents nasty spyware which disabled their pcs . i read recently review ad-aware pc world . writer mentally retarded . he claimed , falsely , ad-aware possessed no real-time spyware blocker . what he doing comparing free version ad-aware pay versions programs like webroot . fair ? no . nevermind . " please discontinue my subscription pc world , because i insist upon intelligent articles , detested reviews influenced bribery . " i think there needs law where anyone who reviews anything should disclose how much they paid certain vendor . case pc world i would estimate mere $10 , 000 , but that enough buy writer daughter braces , isn't it ? if you drop $27 lavasoft you get real-time spyware blocker which works like charm . you take your copy share friends elderly parents , ho-ho-ho ! you find , however , pop-up interceptor overly aggressive can't used all time . it tends cause problems certain web sites . i recommend just using most critical protections . if you're curious , download free edition directly lavasoft . then if you like it , register get ad watch . i think you like i t.t he criminal organizations write distribute spyware bundled inside their games or utilities should prosecuted same virus writers , because their junk disables or reduces performance infected pcs . spyware no better than smashing my car windshield hammer . uninfecting pc potentially costs $100 up , requires few days down-time . i think this law enforcement matter , police should knocking door guilty corporations . executives made bad decisions should serve jail-time , same any vandal who caused millions dollars ( collectively ) property damage . reason major players pc marketplace silent spyware it driving lots new pc purchases . people find their old pc ( infected spyware ) isn't fast it used , they think solution buy new one . real solution install register ad aware . but non-technical person not know this , most people non-technical including many people i care . i am angry way computer scene today , how non-technical people getting shaft .	1
i work it , cable isp . i used swear norton products , until 2003 . after 2003 antivirus , their products junk , however only other mainstream security software out there pretty much mcafee ( which wretched , stinking garbage i've never known anyone who it not get virus ) , i considered it lesser two evils . my work we frequently refer people trend micro housecall , consensus amongst my colleagues seems it best job cleaning up infected systems those our customers whose service suspended due virus activity . i found dozens people recommending housecall scan over those norton , mcafee , even program our company partners provide our free customer security suite . upon finding out trend micro 30 day free trial , i decided give it shot . i think it great program , user friendly possible amount features it . it loads quickly isn't resource hog . i think it really cool you see mac id people connected your wireless network . bad reviews this program frustrated me . you can't fault product ' larger updates than norton ' ... i'd rather suite releasing more updates greater size than norton - how novel find security suite its job ! it not trend micro fault you live boonies use dial up . i don't think it fair give it 1 rating just because you particular type epilepsy where what sets you off ... if i am eating restaurant , somebody next me wearing perfume triggers migraine headache me ( also recognized medical condition ) , i don't give restaurant bad review . after all , food grea t.t he only thing i don't like if you trying change licence key version you machine , there isn't apparent way just change key ... so i took ten minutes uninstall reinstall program , then enter new key ( literally , i think it took less than 10 minutes ) . keep mind kiddies , installing any security suite infected pc or one scores junk left registry mcafee , norton ( or both - some people think if you install 2 it " protects you more " - so not true ) makes you much more likely experience problems install . i never problems uninstalling norton ( 5 pc i it ) installing pc cillin , even without deleting registry entries norton left behind . always security suite , it always best fresh install windows . overall , it runs quickly updates often almost every component you could want out suite . i personally think it best option out there - but keep mind , you get flu shot but it doesn't guarantee you're not going get flu , it just highly reduces likelyhood . it great program i think it cool they give you specialized area website manage licences get access personalized info based products you . also - norton charges 30+ bucks support . mcafee only online support . pc cillin free ( not i've ever call since i've never problem program ) . p.s. : person who reviewed broken english they couldn't log into yahoo mail , ten bucks says your security privacy settings ie ( only someone who uses yahoo mail would use internet explorer ) probably set " high " that why you can't log	1

this review might alittle hard product but i wasnt impressed . expecting something revolutionary instead lessons kind like going though high school again one big exception . they dont give you writen translation what every thing means . rossetta stone focuses pictures actual sounding out words spoken . program you presented picture italian narrator tells you what going or what picture . however what he saying not directly translated written words . its up you figure out what he saying based what you see pictures . so pretty much you not sure times which words spoken verbs or nouns . they their best single out verbs which they give you multiple pictures ppl performing same actions . however still its up you figure out . other than its great program . it forces you pronounce italian italian accent using pictures you see . you able write italian sentences using same technique ( still no english translation ) . i chose language i already knew try program out . if i true beginner ... i might hard time learning this language i would far not fluent it . thats sure	1
i thought upgrade went smoothly i like improvements very muc	1

everyman photoshop cs2 reviewthe reason this called " everyman " review i'm less than expert . fact , if photoshop car , i'd one driving it cross-country first gear . i normally use photoshop creating web graphics or sexing up photos - no shifting required , other words . but photoshop way more than , so much so without it , most designers would curl up die . most us though , running full-bore image-editing app like driving ferrari back yard . i ought know : i've access software long time still don't know what all tools - latest version , adobe photoshop cs2 , even more . said , if you any kind visual project mind modicum talent , there hardly anything you can't . it may take while get rolling , but once you , you'll kill chance your very own copy . see what you ? photoshop cs2 available alone or part adobe creative suite 2 , which includes adobe illustrator cs2 , adobe indesign cs2 , version cue cs2 , adobe golive cs2 , adobe acrobat 7.0 professional premium edition . ( this reviewer slated receive full suite , but " only " photoshop component showed up . color me stupendously grateful regardless , course , but i won't addressing integration features this review . ) $599 standalone version , piracy always problem adobe , but company gone out its way save you yourself requiring activation -- not same thing registration -- within 30 days installation . past , you could buy app install it all your computers ( or any machine matter ) , but new version only works user primary secondary computers . frankly , details activation process left me confused . according adobe activation faq page ( my emphasis ): activation process supports installation two machines . adobe product license agreement allows primary user install product primary computer also home or laptop computer his or her use , provided two copies not used simultaneously . while activation process supports installing activating adobe software two machines , usage product second computer restricted user who licensed software . allowing others use second copy software violates product license agreement . call me dense , but i no idea what they mean not using both copies simultaneously . shortly before submitting this review , i photoshop cs2 running both my computers nothing blew up , nor anyone unpleasant bust down my door . apparently my wife isn't allowed use software tibook , according above . frankly , this absurd , i wish company lawyers would get life . but it may , installation process itself straightforward , although my 500 mhz tibook os 10.3 ( oldie but goodie ) required few hard slaps case above cd-rom drive before disk would mount . first thing i learned when launching new app usual , i coloring outside lines : mac os version 10.3.4 or later recommended maximum performance correct operation adobe photoshop cs2 . earlier version mac os detected . oops ! despite warning , official system requirements listed reviewer guide only call minimum mac os version 10.2.8 , i haven't seen any signs " incorrect " operation yet . true , installing photoshop my 400 mhz blue white g3 os 10.3 seems magically doubled boot time , but that it . if you don't 10.3.4 , i'd say go it anyway . those you older versions , there more than enough useful new features photoshop cs2 justify $149.99 upgrade cost . partial rundown includes following , few which i'll expand upon later : * adobe bridge ( file browser steroids )* vanishing point ( extraordinary plane-based visual perspective tool )* image warp ( turns flat images into shaped graphics )* reduce noise filter ( corrects jpeg compression artifacts more )* 32-bit high dynamic range ( hdr ) editing ( creates images " widest possible dynamic range " )* spot healing brush ( one-click retouching )* one-click red eye tool * optical lens correction * animation ( create animated gifs directly photoshop )* smart sharpen * enhanced 16-bit filter support * smart objects ( allow non-destructive scaling , rotation warping layers within photoshop cs2 )* multiple layer control ( select , align , group simultaneously move multiple layers )* multi-image camera raw ( um ... )* video preview ( preview your work firewire-connected monitor )* wysiwyg font menu ( you're gonna love this )* more color management options when printing * all-new pdf engine ( automatic optimization web viewing )* high capacity ram compatibility ( address 3.5 gb g5 )* expanded , integrated online servicessee what i mean ? adobe bridge , i probably shouldn't comment , since i've never used old file browser [ blush ] . but here what adobe say : acclaimed file browser evolved into its own application - adobe bridge . now , two applications work efficiently parallel - adobe bridge building thumbnails while you edit photoshop cs2 , or photoshop cs2 batch processing images while you continue work adobe bridge . adding essential new features photographers such multiple-file camera raw processing , enhanced ranking labeling , slideshow mode quick review your images , adobe bridge also integrates illustrator cs2 , indesign cs2 golive cs2 , bridging workflow across new creative suite 2 applications . i don't know file browser , but bridge rocks , i'm converted . instead locating particular image finder using column view , bridge i browse any folder my hard drive , see all photos once ( filmstrip view , below , hoot ) , open any or all them photoshop just click . just five minutes playing this opened my eyes , when skeptic like me gets all mushy , people should pay attention . vanishing point filter , completely new cs2 , rates whole review all itself . adobe explains it , " first you define perspective your image creating perspective grids , then you edit your image normally , let vanishing point take care adjusting your editing defined perspective . " what means real terms you things you never dreamed without doing hours work , like pasting " way cool " " yow ! " into image below . ( how i " hah ! " ? keep reading ... ) talk serious empowerment ! i've never even tried work this level , but now i . once you've defined planes ( grids ) your image , you drag objects into distance them still correct perspective . since perspective grids saved inside image ( or separate layer if you want ) , you return re-edit whatever placed them . edit perspective ? yup . you paint directly onto perspective planes stamp tool , make selections within them , whole lot more . this one extraordinary feature . add image warp mix , your inner package designer wake up hollering . adobe thoughtfully included full set presets common object shapes , you drag control points warp grid customize desired . ever wonder how your logo would look coffee mug or baseball cap ? image warp it covered . this what i used place " hah ! " text inside mexican pot , course , remember , i don't know what i'm doing - so power users ought able effect miracles . * * * there lot more talk , but we only one web site , i'm sure my mymac colleagues more say photoshop other cs2 applications . meanwhile , my other picks things thankful cs2 version ability make animated gifs right inside photoshop , spot healing brush removing unwanted pixels single click , multiple layer control , wysiwyg font menu . those you who import vector graphics illustrator ( i don't ) able start whole new religion smart objects , photographers love new camera raw format editing power . this incredibly powerful versatile application . if i santa claus or benevolent deity , i'd make sure every artist designer half ounce talent copy carry him- or herself promised land . it really good , although i say complexity overwhelming beginners . ( adobe help application best i've ever seen , however , provided tremendous assistance writing this review . ) i'd no hesitation whatsoever giving photoshop cs2 highest possible rating , except intuition app grown point where its sheer size multitude features , not mention price , bound limit expansion user base . personally , i'd like take digital carving knife photoshop create half dozen specialty image editing apps , but that not direction adobe going , especially after absorbing macromedia , who say i know better than them ? i also no love increasingly maddening anti-piracy copy protection measures employed industry , although adobe activation process gave me no trouble . it principle thing , i'm just old-fashioned when it comes trusting people . but if you get yourself copy ( legally ! ) , this one , hands down . that why hesitation aside , there isn't even contest . i love it , it already indispensable , even first-gear user.mymac.com rating : 5 out	1

i'm freelance writer reviewer so i quite bit typing . i've carpal tunnel years but it gotten progressively worse . when i saw dragon naturally speaking 8 store i thought i would give it try , especially since it very affordable . this my first review entirely vocal dictation . ( i'm speaking , it writing down my words this review box ! ) it took me less than hour get this program up running , program responds remarkably fast . accuracy some words sometimes hit miss , though . example " hit miss " previous sentence , it wrote " hidden menace " . however , there accuracy tool included which checks audio settings , perform additional training ( reading information into microphone ) , add words your documents vocabulary , more . i haven't used this tool yet , though . i said , i'm less than one hour into testing this it performing great ! if you're used speaking fast loose you may adjust your speaking style when using this tool , enunciating very clearly . during training session they recommend speaking like news broadcast , example . but you don't need speak word word very slowly ... normal speech fine . i find headset comfortable i'm amazed responsiveness this tool . i expected it take longer learn use . if you limited use your hands or carpal tunnel syndrome , i highly recommend dragon naturally speaking 8 . all it takes installing cd-rom , plugging headset speakers doing vocal test adjust microphone levels . i'm excited use this product , which no doubt make life easier both me my hands ! i love it i use this tool word documents , emails , website use !	1

acrobat 5 so buggy i thought i'd give adobe couple product cycles before upgrading . should waited longer . there improvements v7 : better look , better commenting , ability add text actually prints , far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions way worse than v5 : some word documents easy convert pdf v5 not convert v7 , seems something font license issues . installation nightmare repeated re-installation required get past system hangs , clashes standard security software , endless errors automatic update feature . new product activation makes this even more pain because too many re-installations force you activate phone . despite my already low expectations adobe , this product disappointment . acrobat 7 , adobe , usual , charging top $ what any decent company would consider embarrassing mess even beta version .

i qualify this review saying i not own pm 8.0 , so i cannot fairly give rating , despite overwhelmingly negative reviews . i only relate personal experience norton/symantec products . i own used pm 6.0 since ' 01 when it still powerquest instead norton/symantec it worked very well , though gui bit quirky . i run it 2 drives , one 98se xp pro , pm loaded 98se partition it everything i needed both drives . trouble , version 5.0 , afaik , not compatible xp since m$ no longer supports 98se , we problem , houston . currently i am using mobile drive bay switch drives needed . if i get drive partitioning software product compatible xp , it most assuredly not anything produced norton/symantec , based these reviews personal experience norton/symantec products . i first bought computer ' 98 used norton antivirus 5.0 . time , norton probably best antivirus product out there . it worked flawlessly i used recommended it years . no more . i purchased copy symantec system works 2005 right after it released . long story short , i no longer use norton products because i got tired system crashes stability issues caused unstable bloatware system resource hog it become , am currently using competing product very highly rated but not common shelves big box stores . there one lone symantec product i still use --- windoctor , which not installed my ' puter but ran cd needed . adios , anything else produced norton/symantec . it ain't worth headaches when there much better products available less coin .	-1
why newer products getting slower version . i still love version 5 . it not forever open up web browser .. update : i using version 7 now several months .. i am glad say i am now lot happier . granted it still uses lot memory . however , new features it compared version 5 , makes upgrade worthwhile . however , watch out .. there several features adobe took out standard version only pro version ..	-1
i bought this software primarily so i could create slideshows music other special effects . since i got it , i nothing but problems . first all , it would not install completely my computer . techs adobe could not figure out problem . after i reformatted my hard drive , i finally got photoshop install properly . then problem . when i burned my slideshow photos vcd , they came out just awful ( unlike adobe demo video showing perfectly created slideshow . ) boy , i deceived ! i cannot say this software all bad . it nice job correcting exposure errors digital photos . however , if you want create neat slideshows , photoshop elements 4.0 not worth cost	-1
program works fine windows xp easy use . it lets you print cards many sizes . big disappointment number cards comes program . back box claims quot ; 4500+ cards sentiments , celebrate life special moments cards all occasionsquot ; . that nice . problem i counted total number cards come program . it only adds up 1045 ! so where other 3450+ cards sentiments ? you supposed design them yourself ? i just don't know . certainly quot ; cards all occasionsquot ; means just , doesn't it ? well there lots birthday cards plenty holiday cards but not one sympathy card any kind . i guess you just need buy those your own	-1
don't take my word it that quote title recent post excoriating this irritating increasingly bloated product slashdot . warned : adobe not learned its lesson , despite outcry followed release version 6 , this latest release acrobat continues adobe aggressive trend intruding into your desktop environment , again , version 6 without providing easy way undo damage once its -- fact , it now nearly impossible . like earlier releases , this version acrobat adds startup macros new toolbar buttons your existing applications adds menu entries your desktop " right click " menus . adobe argues these conveniences , but they entirely unnecessary ( most us " printing " adobe pdf achieves same result , much more convenient , more natural model ) , clutter what most users either too-crowded user interface ( those who don't knowledge or patience customize it ) or carefully tuned one ( those who ) . unlike many well-behaved applications provide obvious ways avoiding this kind intrusive disruptive behavior ( e.g. through simple checkbox option settings dialog ) , acrobat " option " disabling this behavior , once deeply hidden setup process , now almost completely absent . disable " convert adobe pdf " button mysteriously appears outlook mail editor , example , one sure choose " this feature not available " " microsoft outlook " option under " acrobat pdfmaker " under " create adobe pdf " . simply deleting button using outlook toolbar customization feature not work : it comes right back when editor next opened . similar problems arise word , excel , visio , project , internet explorer . there simply no way get rid never-used " convert adobe pdf " " combine acrobat ... " entries appear desktop context menus files ( even if one installs none acrobat pdfmaker features ) . technically inclined wishing repair some damage acrobat 7 , there complex but largely effective step step instructions available web , but even authors these driven despair version 7 : ( " adobe really pushed boat out acrobat 7 managed screw word royally " ) . short , acrobat make mess your working environment , there no way completely fix it , even partial fix pain ( not well documented ) . ( this may seem minor issue , but if every application followed adobe reckless example , our working environments would start look like strip malls , crowded features screaming our attention point where it hard find what we need when we need it . one great strengths personal computer desktop users configure it ways suit their needs ; no application should interfere . ) experienced acrobat users also notice this version continues frustrating trend acrobat ( most other adobe applications ): it yet again slower launch than previous version . fact , my 2 ghz pentium 4 , it takes longer launch than entire visual studio . net development environment , longer than boot sequence windows xp ! there other minor problems well ( arbitrary rearrangements menu tool bar items , etc . ) but these two major flaws more than bad enough . unless you really need latest acrobat features , you should probably avoid this upgrade . if " improvements " this release any indication where adobe plans go future releases , it may time start looking elsewhere tool digital document management . fortunately , there no reason all upgrade . version 7 offers no usefully new features , so you ( should ) avoid this one ( all costs )	-1
effort boost their file numbers appear more comprehensive , creators included many very low resolution images they " artsied " or " roughed " up dirty polaroid-transfer effect , or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides , which they must hoped would excuse poor quality original image . example , if you search " tiger " , you get 165 results , but only 86 animal , ( not one 20 images 10 toy tigers , or 5 images one tiger-striped chair-cushion so ) , those 86 , 80 crusty effect applied them . other 6 tigers taken out those same 80 images clipped out their background give you floating tiger clump grass or tiger head ( but , thankfully , not " dirtied " up transfer effect ) . out all , there not one clean image tiger its environment . here example . search " sunset " yields 247 results . these , 163 crusty polaroid transfer effect applied , 70 same images duplicated ( much smaller ) sloppy stack 5 slides . there two clean sunset images . these typical results . numbers don't mean anything ! this product stuffed multiple images toys , frankly not-so-attractive people hard angles , old low-resolution stock photos achieve 150,000 files . would it killed them include one clean , print-resolution image each category ? perhaps we could without 50 fake slide images ( talk dated anyway ! ) order get product worth around	-1

first version easy cd creator i used cd creator 4 basic . it okay , pretty much what it said it : basic . i got upgrade ebay auction it worked pretty good . later due lack support manufacturer new cdrw drives good old version 4 , i upgraded cd creator 5 platinum ( version sold here . ) this too worked pretty good - little while . then operation moved over adaptec roxio , point onward , things more thorny than rosy . roxio require you register product order download ( one ) utterly essential update keep this thing running . perhaps you don't mind , but i feel it somewhat minor invasion privacy . plus you keep track your password website if you change isp you re-register . hassle say least . also , since roxio took reins , there no further updates provided . instead roxio tries " encourage " ( read " browbeat " ) you into getting software upgrade even more money . this upgrade not work win98se , which i still use various reasons . so if i upgrade software again , i would also spend extra money new operating system all faults foibles introduce other apps i need still use . if you money burn all those shiny round coasters you going making , i applaud you . i prefer keep little cash retirement . it difficult if not impossible get support any real carbon-based life form , website gives little or no support some issues you may face , such getting " illegal request " errors direct cd , or inability format or erase cdrw once possible version 4 . also , any cdrw created version 4 may not readable new software , or least there some technical issues this . any rate , it not neccessarily all " easy " unless you fairly technically inclined understand ( or willing learn ) some finer technical points cd recording technology . i prefer not bothered it , i just want create some cds . i now find some functions not work appropriately all , especially direct cd , program originally provided ability " drag drop " writing files read/write cd . now i find direct cd non-functional , only cd i write cdr , there problems growing area well . speed cdrw or brand recording media not seem issue . software simply refuses work it once . it shouldn't called " easy cd creator " . perhaps " irritating " cd creator would more appropriate . summary : this not deserve stars . perhaps few " black holes " ? while i once would given wholehearted supported this product , regrettably i cannot support it same enthusiasm now .	-1

microsoft office handy . files you open , edit create it ( most notably . doc , . xls , . ppt ) probably closest universal compatibility among all your high quality options . it ( relatively ) intuitive . it pretty broad array useful functions . it also obscenely expensive , considering fact you get all these things -- . doc , . xls , . ppt ; intuitive interface ; functionality -- free . i hunted up openoffice two years ago when i decided several hundred dollars insane price pay ability write papers , make basic presentations , or put together spreadsheets . i looking basic functionality , but i pleasantly surprised ; openoffice most neat tricks , too . ( actually , it neat trick microsoft never replicate : it open source , so it respond needs individual users . you just say " add this neat trick !

easy language 16 only useful if you're already familiar language you wish learn . i've studying french months before buying this product found it helpful when i'm getting rusty . only problem it hard make out what said because sound not clear . recorded speakers also don't bother slow down give you chance understand or repeat what said . this good cause it like listening actual french speaker not robot , bad if you actually want learn how pronounce what said . it also go over basic french grammar but totally useless if you don't already know basic french grammar . i also tried use this learn japanese . unlike french , i'm not familiar japanese language all so trying use this product learn it became nightmare . if all you want learn how speak language it romanized version words phrases make it easier sound them out . unfortunately basic japanese grammar japanese alphabet all written japanese . instance , grammar section it past , present future " i am " it written english then beside it it written japanese . you can't click them it sound out you . japanese alphabet section all it japanese alphabet you click them sound them out but you really no clue what you sounding out . so it teaches you nothing reading language but test they want you take purely japanese . i want learn how read , write speak japanese so none this would problem if it actually taught you how read , write , speak japanese ! so my guess would you really familiar japanese ( not romanized(romanjj ) version ) already order use this product . because my experiences this product i would say get it only if you know languages you're interested use it refresher nothing more . since i am familiar french this product pretty helpful but if i used this starter language i probably would quit . i'm searching amazon better japanese books . so if you want actually learn language look books language tapes cd 	-1

ok ! richest human planet called earth , bill gates decided he not wealthy enough . so he released this microsoft office 2003 , which i really think not much different previous edition . price , usual , very expensive . what worse bill gates decided all pre-installed windows new laptops desktops come trial version . so mere mortals like us need spend extra big money buying full version simply some basic documents . i see bill gates , deified bloodsucker , using $100 dollar bills toilet paper , laughing us who work their butt off just make enough money live . so shame you bill gates microsoft	-1
i bought this upgrade because i thought it would let me share my contacts . it says so box , but it doesn't . it works just like old contacts which you can't share others except if you export it . no live sharing . why couldn't they make it so i could put file my server ? or secure site ? then all my office work off one contact list . 50% or more time business contacts can't found when you search contact . it like business contacts add doesn't work outlook . or you add contacts , save it , email saved email address then go find contact later it gone . also , lots times when you try send , email won't send , it stays outbox . repeatedly you open hit send button but it won't change send status . now , if you leave it outbox , sometimes fools program into letting you send other email . or sometimes you forward send .. geez , what waste money this upgrade . we won't using it any our other computers we haven't bought if new computers we ordered .	-1

i trusted this software would what it claimed so let down its lack performance i am dumbfounded left speechless . during backup process i selected 15gb info backup , spanning 4 dvds . everything looked fine , except two ( 2 ) simple errors i received , indicating those related files may not copied/backed up properly . i figured no big deal , 2 files/errors out 15gb , i could handle . based upon false pretenses my critical info backed up properly ( simple pictures , videos , mp3 files financial files include previous years tax files ) , i then proceeded slick my drive . remember , only 2 simple , benign almost inconspicuous errors during backup process . everything looked great . during restore process , i then received numerous errors , each them requiring me click ' yes ' when asked if i wanted proceed . i got tired clicking yes around 100 or so mark decided click no . when you click ' no ' , everything undone ; there no ' ignore all ' function so i sit through every prompt got tired it decided proceeding 1000 files answering yes would involve too much pain me . i then selected smaller group files restored , only ' my documents ' folder but ran into same situation . eventually i ran test small folder restored still ran into errors but pressed through . hardly any files received error free those issues never restored . my guess approximately 2/3 or 3/4 my files not restored course none really mattered made it . i latest update applied program , so should not cause . i would better slick my entire hard drive without going through backup process i would nearly same place but without experiencing all headaches , frustrations investment hours , no days my time . program recently purchased microsoft inclusion vista os , i imagine . it well microsoft product , it fails deliver upon its promises	-1

my last roxio product " easy cd creator 5 . " when i switched mac i naturally expected " toast " mac version this product . i am extremely disappointed find crippled video editing features my ( many years old ) version cd creator miles ahead what they include most current up date version " toast " which i unfortunately own . it allowed me edit video clips , create several levels customizable menus , customize size compression , burn dvd which played my standard dvd player . toast create one uncustomizable menu level , no editing , locks up every time you drag file into it . they ( product description ) say it reads mpegs but it more like it freezes every time it sees mpeg . it doesn't even read every mpeg reliably . only thing i find roxio adds toast isn't my old version cd creator more enhanced mp3 music features ( which isn't what i bought it ) . i may better off using " parallels " combination cd creator . i am sorry but compared roxio cd creator ( which basically same price ) , toast seems designed total idiots . i always thought mac software better working multimedia	-1
turbotax what looks like it would geat feature -- ability import data your financial institutions so you don't enter all your stock sales hand . some cost basis ( how much i bought shares ) empty , so i go enter them manually . no big deal , just took few minutes . however , when i went e-file , program flagged these changes " overrides " computed values , refused let me e-file return . equally bad if i just leave fields empty -- they came charles schwab , then it looks like i got stocks free , huge tax bill ( incorrect ) . so , after many hours trying see if i could change field so it would not flagged " override " , i determined other upset users turbotax forums intuit.com i out luck . i'd print it out mail it . special reward , turbotax doesn't even tell you what attachments you need include return you now forced mail . help screen says what it prints out tell you what include return . that wrong . so , main reason i got turbotax e-file . now , i get print it out , find out all crap i attach return , mail it , then wait weeks months get my return . thanks , intuit !!!! saddest part hr block sent me free copy taxcut before i bought turbotax . i should used before i spent $30 piece crap like turbotax . won't again	-1
isn't this mac product ? i thought mac products supposed ( ) stable , ( ) easy use . this product stable , ( once i upped my ram 2gb ) but 512mb it brought system crawl . but far ease use--i'm not dumb guy ( although my kids may argue point ) but this product really victum itself . it too hard " express " audience really intended ( my opinion ) only profression final cut pro users . other words , if you use final cut pro work , want something your home-mac , express version great value . you already know it people paid you get used it . but if you're imovie user , pinnacle systems studio user , adobe premiere elements 2.0 user , this product seems like i'm trying fly space shuttle . how you output wmv this product ? you it any pc-based products , oh , they also output quicktime so why apple hangup wmv ? i recently asked apple forum " how you picture picutre ? " i got great response experienced user . " it only took couple minutes , just these 6 steps ... " great , premiere elements or pinnacle , i click pip icon its . i didn't 6 obscure steps . product also one those old fashion " million windows all over place " applications . you try minimize thing pressing one tiny little minimize buttons ( like all mac apps ) it closes only window app , like preview window , not timeline , not browser . bottom line ... if you already use , know love final cut pro , this low-cost way get similar product your own pc ( although academic version pro version pretty affordable too ) . i don't see point this product unless its just provide low-cost entry into final cut pro people who use pro living	-1

i using this product now almost year . only reason i insist using it because i feel really bad wasting my money . first , this not worth $300 bucks . there only still pictures sound . no movies or any fancy graphics , so why price ? second it very repetitive it not advance very logical way so you recognize grammatical structures behind ever changing sentences . third , sentences you repeat over over not practical all . you keep memorizing thins like " boy under airplane " or " ball boy head " . initially i thought , well this because it progresses very slowly which not necessarily bad . but then i took look last lessons ; you just keep repeating useless senteces like these without real things used dialogue . i cannot recommend you course because i spent so much this one i not want try again get disappointed . don't fooled wonderful reviews like i . this definitively not worth 300 dollars . it not even useful basic converstion . i learned much more simple travel books cassettes library . ah , if you think repeating these structures alone you understand german grammar ..	-1
normally i might wait install new software upgrade , but i just got new laptop thought it would best use office 2007 new vista operating system . i wrong . you would expect multi-billion dollar company like microsoft could put out powerful bug-free piece software . but after month using office 2007 , you get distinct impression this software not ready public release . microsoft should ashamed . i don't know root cause my problems , but i stress i am running clean install office 2007 vista , so there shouldn't any software conflicts or issues . so what my issues ? list long : -- my biggest concern ms word constantly hangs stalls . it making editing document very painful . i suspect problem when i put images or visio diagrams into document . but something old ms word able without issue . oddly , if i colleague open document save it out word 2003 , problem goes away ! what ?! it killing my productivity . -- when ever i cut paste old document , word hangs 15 20 seconds . often formatting margins my new document go haywire . i keep spend ton time fixing things . this never happened old word . this time killer . -- every few days , outlook 2007 starts telling me it cannot display my email folders . uh oh ! i completely restart my computer see my email again . -- outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails people send -- they look like mess . it because outlook 2007 not render html correctly since it uses word engine , not internet explorer display email . i no idea why microsoft this , but they got fix it . -- many issues old word 2003 still haven't fixed . if you place image , it often hard get it appear correctly . why can't they solve this one ? -- while most office programs new ribbon interface ( which i like ) , some programs like visio 2007 not . so you remember how use two interfaces . couldn't microsoft find time money update all its programs ? give me break . -- few occassions visio 2007 , my files failed save correctly . first i thought this must my fault , but it happened me few times can't coincidence . few times i've gotten error message lost my work . ug . -- word excel 2007 use completely new file format . so anyone you send document 2007 installed ( which isn't likely case ) . get around this , you save it down 2003 file format , but then you end up two files your hard drive -- one new format one old format . what pain ! also , there definitely seems issue office 2007 opening older office 2003 files . could cause many my problems , but there no way i avoid using old files . they should worked harder compatibility . there good things new 2007 . i like new interface design new features outlook 2007 amazing organizing tasks sharing your calendar . but i don't think it fair microsoft released product so full serious , serious bugs cost me hours hours extra work . i didn't spend hundreds dollars beta product don't think public should suffer . surely they afford better !	-1

i regret purchased this product . i not able use it two months , after finally giving up trying get it work . i very nice laptop running windows xp home , encountered many problems . i tried all avenues available me through quickbooks , online , via email , telephone . i spent nearly 25 hours overall trying get numerous issues taken care . here just few : program would not convert my quicken data ; random script errors when you try access help topics within product ; phone # provided payroll demo invalid ; none my info viewable after bank download - it spontaneously failed download my bank account info , after successfully downloaded it two weeks . i spent 2 1/2 hours phone trying resolve just this one issue . part problem lies fact i unable speak customer service person who first language english . each time i phone , customer service person seemed continually ask me re-describe problem , then he/she would seem typing info into computer waiting .... then eventually telling me some solution try , then eventually telling me they not know what problem . not helpful any way , though very polite . i'm sorry say this terribly designed , convoluted , over-complicated , non-user-friendly item which i would like toss over cliff .	-1

i " upgraded " norton 2006 version internet security virus protection software online . included norton systemworks . i used norton anti-viral software exclusively several years without any major problems . yes , i always remove my previous version , before adding new software . even though my internet connection via private satellite antenna , it took almost two hours product download install . then when i rebooted my laptop ( new high-end sony vaio windows xp ) , it froze up during startup . i won't go into all hassle involved , but after three removals downloads over period several weeks , it became apparent there something seriously wrong norton 2006 product . it caused crashes almost daily basis , updates always took excessive amount time . customer service no help all , company refused refund my purchase price . i've since switched different brand anti-viral internet protection software no more problems my computer . after this experience , i never use norton products again . only reason i gave this 1-star rating because it lowest rating available . it should actually minus 5 stars aggravation time money wasted	-1
summary : i wasted lot time trying make this work , i eventually went back other products . theory , integrating virus checker , firewall , spyware , data backup into unified suite ( like ms office word , excel , powerpoint ) makes sense . however , this software package seems poorly made ; it not work very well me . hardware , os , primary software used : 1 . dell lattitude d620 laptop 2gb ram , windows xp , ms office2 . dell x1 laptop ( thin/lightweight ) 2gb ram , windows xp , ms office3 . dell dimension desktop 4 gb ram , windows xp , children gamesprior virus/spyware products : lattitude x1 : nortondimension : freeware provided our isptheory : since microsoft makes os office applications get infected viruses , their product should better integrated os . there synergy integrating several related software applications . lesson : well , after series terrible experiences , i hope others benefit my wasted time : 1 . instead loading most program cd downloading small updates , this seems load only small part program downloads huge files . this made me feel product shipped unfinished . you this separately each machine since it hides downloaded files then deletes them prior finishing installation . this took better part afternoon . 2 . i purchased 3-pack license . installing activating software 2nd 3rd machines required series very annoying steps involved logging into their website broken links . it finally required phone call . least , phone support experience good . 3 . product promises minimize performance impact , improve overall performance . lattitude dimension ( powerful machines ) , there no difference performance , but we could notice slightly slower performance x1 . this later verified when we uninstalled ms windows onecare replaced it product . 4 . product difficulty updating . it opens small message box asks you click update onecare , but takes you webpage only works 1 4 times . 5 . except first time , data backup always several errors i manually fix . this very rarely happened other data backup software i've used . 6 . some applications , firewall asks everytime permission connect internet although application list always allow this connection .	-1

unlike versions up no . 6 , this version require authorization . this means single use version can't loaded multiple computers . adobe informed me this not bug wanted me buy multiple copies eventhough i am only using one computer time . this version forces you take off old legal version order install . when i found out my legal version couldn't used , it forced me reinstall version 6 , this took almost hour install , reboot , un-install reinstall orginal version . why adobe only company forces this ? their program installation don't even skip one set four numbers next . they force you type dashes numbers . if you multiple computers stay away anything above version 6	-1
i used both paperport 8 paperport 9 deluxe over year so i am qualified report . both pieces software some form severe incompatibility windows xp pro . i cannot really get version 9 operate . everytime i try its like cold molasses . click ... wait .... wait .... wait ... wait ... then lock up . i'm very experienced . i've working pcs since 1991 . every other piece software i've loaded works very well ... except paperport 8 9 . theory paperport 9 should fine because it converts all scans pdf which more or less universal file format . however theory lot better than reality . support nonexistent scansoft . if you pay $19.95 per incident , you still not get solution . scansoft forum always either not working ( bad sign ) or it full people complaining software lack support . unfortunately there not lot alternatives , but doqments looks promising . avoid paperport unless you money time waste	-1

i purchased turbo tax after reading reviews here ... someone mentioned glitch , but someone else mentioned work around . bottom line , if you sit down all your records whole turbo tax start finish one swoop , you're fine . but if you need start stop while completing schedule 2 business aspects your tax return , get ready huge problem ... it doesn't let you back ! i went their website where they both work around , report if you update your turbo tax ( very easy ) glitch fixed . not so , it nothing me . then i tried workarounds ... i got back once but next time i tried use work around few days later , it not work . i ended up call accountant 1 week before 17th thank goodness i able get appointment . also , if you business don't understand some tax workings , like depreciation , it very difficult translate your former accountant previous year work into new turbotax . it not set up way , so you need know what you're doing . i college degree lot stick-to-it-ness , but i could not figure out sure i entering things correctly . then , it didn't matter anyway , i couldn't get change anything end . finally , make sure you save , save , save you go ! while doing my turbo tax spent couple hours already , i logged into their website get some support . when i " " ed out internet page , it closed my turbotax screen i'd opened my computer . guess what ? it all lost i start beginning . before i even impacted " glitch " later . this program not remind you save when you close , or ask you if you want save , so sure save all time ! so , good luck anyone who tries this . me , it huge disappointment i am returning it amazon refund due glitch . i honestly don't know how they sell something such obvious problem .	-1

unlike years past , hr block ( founded guy named bloch ) decided charge $16 each e-file , federal or state . only one version , " premium federal+state+e-file " includes " free " federal e-file state e-file ; but version costs $70 , so there no free lunch all . seriously , $16 lot pay e-filing . there websites give you completely free e-filing ; my favorite taxact ( taxactonline dot com ) . taxact , you get complete federal plus state package $7.95 , which includes e-filing . or you use their standard package prepare federal e-file free , * no * income restriction ! i don't work any these companies , nor any tax-related company , nor any such entity . i just don't think it right hr block charge customers such ridiculously high fee e-filing , whereas people e-file free elsewhere . btw , if you use taxcut prepare your return , you'll use hr block e-filing service if you want e-file ; you can't just take your file website expect website it you . i used taxact past they very dependable . you find reviews taxact products major magazines major websites . good luck	-1

i used spyware doctor since version 3 -- almost three years now . i liked interface simplicity -- power . but others pointed out , including industry reviews , version 4 . huge drain system resources . my pc would take anywhere 5-9 minutes completely boot up , spyware doctor using almost 100% cpu whole time . also , my computers would frequently " freeze , " which turned out spyware doctor randomly zooming 95-100% cpu no reason all . but version 5 , things so much worse . 3 weeks ago , my pc lost their ability connect internet . browsing slowed crawl , frequent timeouts " server not found " . i spent days phone my cable company , my router manufacturer , trying troubleshoot . i re-configured my entire home network over over . i never made connection onset problems my updating sd5 . it only after finding pctools support forums i realized problem spyware doctor . i removed program my pc -- problems gone . i full internet connection full speed again . spyware doctor 5 causing massive problems users . pctools rewrote program ground up , company says , improve resource drain caused version 4 . but apparently it rushed market even though beta testers reported many these same problems weeks . i've uninstalled this software am basically wasting my subscription losing money . other users right -- pctools indeed " auto-renew " charge your credit card without warning . this huge red flag . i lost hours , days , dealing problems caused this program . many users reinstall windows completely . it easy get caught up hyperbole negative reviews . but don't just take these face value -- read spyware doctor forum pctools ' website . these problems real . it doesn't look like they're going addressable anytime soon . they've issued couple version updates , even removed several program protection " guards " , but these haven't fixed problems . they're not giving any kind timeline or explanations users . my advice -- stay away now . but keep up forums pctools ' website . when they finally get issues resolved , this should really strong spyware program . * pctools also criticized offering " free spyware scan " their website ( actually download sd ) , which find spyware your system but refuse remove it until you buy subscription spyware doctor . this kind sleazy bullying isn't normally characteristic reputable companies -- most give you actual free trial functioning software	-1

i switched tax cut years ago after turbotax ( 2003 ) implemented their idiotic validation scheme . i figured i doing my part punish intuit / turbotax . all those years i've happy tax cut . not this year . i found some major bugs which cost me lot time . i my return , but numbers seriously out whack -- i know i didn't much income ! going back through interview process didn't turn up source added money . only checking actual " forms " i find several copies 1099-misc forms hidden interview process , adding same data non-hidden copies , i double entering data . there no easy way recover . i eventually wipe installation start all over . call tech support absolutely no good . person other end didn't seem understand problem " hidden " copies forms going into calculations . if those hidden , what else it doing wrong ? i'm not quite sure how deal this next year . go back turbotax ? hope tax cut fixes its problems ? or go human tax preparer ? whatver my choice , i'm not looking forward it .	-1
this program sucks . i used it last year thought it unwieldy really confusing ( i.e. unlike turbotax other programs , there very little transparency system ) . then i bought it again this year because store i went out turbotax , i needed get my taxes quickly . this year even worse than last year - not only it still unwieldy irritating , but it gave me figures simply not make sense . results federal return ok , but it gave me figures would cost me over $ 2,000 taxes i not owe my state return . i ended up going online double check my results using cheap ($10 ) online service recommended ny state tax website . within 45 minutes , i cleared online source , got results made far more sense . i no idea what happened taxcut , but i suspect they may missing field somewhere line - this problem noted number others reviews variety sites . i not buying this product again	-1

i used turbo tax 20 years loved it . past it user-friendly , efficient complete - it even printed out all forms i needed - ready send irs . usual , i purchased it this year . format changed isn't nearly user friendly years past . you manually select walk-through feature , section section it very easy miss sections . when i got end , it wouldn't let me review errors until i updated version . but , i don't internet home couldn't update . it crashed my computer 3 times before i skipped review totally . ( god only knows what else i skipped process . ) when i went print forms - again it nagged me software inferior needed updated . again , i skipped it but pages printed out nasty watermark saying forms weren't updated couldn't used . i can't use these . i can't send them irs . so , i find irs forms manually insert information myself . so , why i spend money software ?? why would they sell product you can't actually use ? yes , it'll " prepare " my forms . but , what good if i can't print them out ? why would they sell product already so obsolete you can't use it without contacting company version ? absolutely - run - don't walk - run run run away this product . don't buy it because it simply doesn't work . i won't use turbo tax again . they lost faithful long time customer	-1
i bought this product because positive member reviews outstanding review cnet . however , i just bought new dell inspiron e1505 shipped windows vista home premium , zonealarm 6.5 flat out incompatible new os . i downloaded zonealarm 7.0 flat out incompatible well . i'm sure this great security suite windows xp , but beware if you vista . there seems no update their website when zonelabs release vista compatible zonealarm . ( they mention something " after january 2007 " , but it march , crying out loud ! ) so there my purchase price good product down drain	-1
i bought vista upgrade my dell computer . i tried install half way through set up , after it uninstalled my old programs , i got message abort . abort left me damaged media program , thus far i spent over $400 trying re-connect damaged files programs . my best advice wait until microsoft gets " kinks " out vista program then buy upgrade	-1
much worse than previous mcafee editions . i dropped norton some older desktops due its lack support w2000 . i then went free edition avg anti-virus , which ok but slowed things down . thinking " you get what you pay " i sprung mcafee which ok past . edition i purchased 3 licenses . i installed one these my wife xp laptop well one my desktops ( luckily , she still talking me ) . 2007 mcafee suite makes avg look like free ferrari . absolutely terrible performance , coupled mediocre interface . perhaps only poorer-performing way assure you'll never get virus , spam , etc . would hit your motherboard hammer . this slow down your computer ( even worse , unpredictably ) . if you lots email outlook or outlook express expect open your mail box , then long break before you thing ( it rechecks everything spam ) . there partial workaround this , but users shouldn't search workarounds . every web action now noticeable latency -- well slower applications when mcafee grinding away background . if you liked your current anti-spam , kiss it goodbye -- mcafee may not let you keep it . mcafee ( like norton ) also difficult remove your system . what prompted this review ? today it appears update process rebooted my computer without requiring " yes " me . alternatives , i wasn't able get kaspersky anti-virus run older machine -- somewhare remnant norton persisted ( possibly document tagged symantec etc . left over day working them ages ago ) . however , i get it running laptop its better than norton-mcafee-and even avg my opinion . so , consider kaspersky or vendor . if doesn't work try avg . it interesting see how mcafee responds -- they've really shot themselves foot this release	-1
buyer beware : this program critically impair your system ! internet loading drastically crippled . expect frequent system choppiness due automatic downloading background processes . there no way close mcafee get around these drawbacks other than uninstall . i am going return this first thing next week . i gave them few weeks improve performance patches upgrades , but nothing changed . if only i read reviews ahead time . bottomline : if you don't mind these side-effects , all means purchase this program ; mcafee solid protection . but there easier ways get protection	-1
i didn't use this particular product but version came my computer which slow but not end world . problem i them they aoutomatically renew your subscription without giving any warning they going it . i 2-year subscription they send me e-mail 2 years later saying they charged my account never telling me i auto enrollment ! when i called complain they course someone who couldn't inderstand me i spell my e-mail address three times told it would take 3-5 days refund processed which crap because i work online store its easier void sale cheaper vendor refund same day ! i asked manager twice , second time they came back they nerve ask me if i interested upgrade subscribing their magazine , put never-ending hold until i gave up 37 minutes later which probably plan all . so i called my bank put stop payment automatic payment . now i am searching protection program calling their customer service before my purchase see how it goes	-1

this far most basic editing/creative package i ever used . i using every version print shop since some their early versions . i print shop 22 haveing issues printing ms vista . i figured i would able purchase one broderbund similar products ( one made vista ) it would similar style usage . wrong . i not able import other print shop projects , printing limited , no drag drop feature other programs , limited editing , formating text off when copying one document , sizing pictures text boxes while editing projects limited dragging corners only , on-and-on . i tried use broderbund tech support page , but it very limited their faq section . try asking question or emailing help ; good luck . i fumble this product awhile ( only because i print more than one page time , because ps 22 vista only allows this)and wait until next compatible version ps comes out windows vista . i would thought there would least patch now . i think they may made zoom way it now allow newer , better versions . i hope this helps ...	-1

this upgrade disaster . first all , word , view markups function default now , so you go through change all settings hide markups ( most people my department not want see those distracting colors balloons not need edit doc any way ) . however , if you want send document not tracked changes embedded -- because you don't know which version word recipient , you can't take chance them seeing all those comments -- you go through document again , view markups , reject comments , accept changes , resave . it kind difficult explain , frustrating too . people think if they can't see it , then recipient won't able see it either . this good explanation microsoft help forum : * not displaying * tracked changes isn't same * not * tracked changes . even when using word 2002 , changes still documents , anyone could see them just turning display . all happened 2003 display automatic . way documents which changes not displayable remove changes documents entirely -- you must * accept or reject * all changes . nothing you view sufficient . if you need retain record changes , you'll maintain two sets documents : one changes , which * never * leave your office , " scrubbed " sent out . still , it big problem more unnecessary work than 2002 version . also , outlook new default view quite different than before . panes set differently , so you go view/reading panes change positions . then you ungroup items ( breaks weeks very annoying ... most people don't like , although i guess some people think it looks more organized ) . oh , microsoft - can't live it , can't live without it . almost forgot ... buttons/icons prettier this version , we all know makes huge difference . yessss ! pretty buttons ! i die happy now .	-1

this most god awful method learning language i ever encountered . my jaw dropped when i saw nasa other government agencies using this software order learn foreign language . if truly case then i demand my tax dollars back . it bad . reason i gave this software shot because their marketing campaign asserting it absolute definitive method learning new language . you're probably looking it same reason . first , you should know you purchase set flash cards your local bookstore it just effective any rosetta stone softare costs 90% less . i used this software when i borrowed it friend order see if it better than my current method learning mandarin , which i'll get into later . i opportunity make copies this software when it my possession but decided against it . not out fear piracy penalties , just plain because i would rather not this software than copy it . that really how awful it . imagine if your parents tried teach you english only teaching you noun/picture association ? it wouldn't work unless you learned proper english grammar proper syntax . if you learned verbs other things . this program assume you know all your chinese numbers automatically . very beginning picture little girl show up it verbally say ' one little girl ' mandarin ... however it not tell you which word means number one , which word means girl , so . it guessing game , not learning experience . all positive reviews i've seen any rosetta stone software amazing seem absolutely phony fabricated me ( especially rosetta stone japanese page ) . please beware , there no better way prove what i'm saying true other than trying demo yourself . i am sure it bad full retail version i used week . absolute best method i've used learning mandarin pimsleur audio cds . ( i've never tried berlitz pimsleur other competitors , but i'm sure they better than rosetta stone ) . i used mandarin i ii so far pimsleur , i am able hold impressive conversations other fluent speakers mandarin . great thing it pimsleur explains everything you , allows you say it out loud , there no brute memorization involved pimsleur , only natural language assimilation . just ask yourself this , when you learned english child . you learn learning how read write first ? or you learn how speak listen first ? didn't you learn syntax first then use what you learned formulate your own sentences ? that exactly how pimsleur taught me mandarin . i surprised how i able create my own grammatically correct sentences pimsleur only few lessons . go ahead try demo any rosetta stone language . it should enough keep you away rosetta stone favor any their competitors . i've heard good things berlitz others , but pimsleur my opinion absolute best .	-1
i liked software itself . first year i used it , i thought i'd start regular tt customer . then it april 17 2007 i tried e-file . servers would not respond all day . there no admins reached support sites or forums ( except one who said " i don't know what problem i nothing tell you " ) . one major failing this software it cannot automatically try connect . if it fails , it says " try again 10 minutes " . which i've all night . now - i miss my tax deadline spent 6 hours my computer trying get connected . mail not option now my car gone . this major failure company utter lack support , since their officials apparently couldn't bothered come work tax day offer us any solutions . i not buy again .	-1

i using turbo tax years just i jave used quicken years . one big plusses me it deductible , program places values items you give charities imports directly into turbo tax . it deductible stand alone program until 2006 when it went intuit online entries . you could not longer buy program install your pc . this would ok but then intuit would not allow you see values placed donations until you purchased turbo tax . intuit thinking bottom line rather than customer . i hated told intuit my feelings - no response i expected . but what heck , i entered my donations through 2006 when turbo tax 2006 came out i purchased it amazon good price . after installing turbo tax i went see what my donation values import values into turbo tax my online entries . nope - no . not only it deductible buried turbo tax very clunky slow link start program but there absolutely no way import . after much searching intuit support pages - always chore - i finally found page explaining - no import . but if you like you get voucher unlock online values then manually re enter information into turbo tax ! what crock . top using it deductible turbo tax slows my duo core pc crawl . i look elsewhere next year	-1

when i considered purchasing this product , i confused see some people thought it great , others thought it terrible . i couldn't understand why there such discrepancies reviews . after i bought it i understood : some things it , it works fine -- no problems . however , there many major bugs software , if you need one buggy functions , you'll sorry you bought it . examples some problems : 1 . if you burn audio track entitled " blue fog " nero give it title " fog . " 2 . every time i run backup , it tells me there write error , but backup seems ok . 3 . i backed up every file my drive , but when my system crashed , there problems prevented me restoring my system . 4 . it blue screened my system one time . 5 . many commands poorly or not all documented . example , wave editor declipper function , but there no documentation how use it . so , i'd recommend you look instead competing product . good luck	-1

i used norton virus protection norton internet security several years . i am currently running nis 2006 . my experience these products not good but out fear i just renewed my subscription . since then i nothing but trouble nis . since my renewal within grace period i decided request refund . i tried this on-line but found it impossible waste effort . their web site support useless their product . norton internet security i clicked support linked their web site . once there , i tried apply refund but their system not recognize my subscription renewal order number . it recognize my product order number nis 2006 but not refundable so no help there . i gave up requesting refund decided contact support . if you click " contact us " there 2 options , telephone or email . telephone support down because earthquake taiwan . i decided try email . i clicked email got following security alert : there problem this website security certificate . security certificate presented this website expired or not yet valid . security certificate problems may indicate attempt fool you or intercept any data you send server . we recommend you close this webpage not continue this website . click here close this webpage . continue this website ( not recommended ) . how ironic ? i know i their site because i navigated there clicking support nis . you would think internet security company could maintain their own security certificates . i'm not surprised though because everything symantec designed make you hate them . their product abysmal . it bogs my system down crawl , disrupts performance other applications hogs system resources . if you put nis your computer you'd better get used staring hourglass icon long periods time , especially if you don't tons virtual memory hard disk space available . nortons ccapp retards start up forever won't shut down when you want log off . recently i reinstall my windows xp operating system . after i major problems nis uninstall it . it then i realized how much better my system ran without it . i already paid my renewal fee so i downloaded reinstalled nis nothing but trouble since . i tried leave feedback symantecs web site but typical them , not work either . i wrote long complaint , then clicked submit . error message came up saying go back correct highlighted areas . when i clicked back button all text i typed gone ... just because i failed enter subject line feedback report . i'll damned if i type all information back again . if you buy nis you'd better hope it works first time . if you think your going get good support symantec or anything out their website - think again . oh , btw beware , symantec enrolls you automatic renewal unless you go their website un-enroll . once they your money just try get it back . symantec sets up road blocks so you eventually just give up frustration . this how they make their money rather than making good product .	-1

federal returns this generally usable product very poor user interface help system , state returns this product falls below bar " usable " . i used principle competitor , " tax cut : past found it generally poor ui , but it significantly better than turbo tax . some examples poor user interface experience : * if you enter employer id number w-2 attempt retrieve it internet retrieve fails , then you asked re-enter same id number when you enter w-2 information manually . * investment sales : i 20 stocks i've sold over past year , but window only shows 3 time ( scrollbar ) . * form page , schedule d-1 ( continuation form stock sales ) displayed screen scrollbar if number items exceeds window height , but scroll bar would not let me scroll bottom 2 entries . printing these out however show them * when entering stock sale , you indicate it worthless which turbo tax tell you it set sale date 12/31 , regardless what you entered compliance irs rules . so my next stock worthless i tried not enter sale data knowing it would just override it , but program insisted i enter sale data , only then immediately override it . * entering federal information usually clear enough , but obvious lack effort shown state returns ( pa my case ) . cryptic questions asked no explanation no useful help . example " enter adjustment income , indicate type adjustment -- choice type include oid , abp , etc . no explanation what these !. it not clear whether amount " adjustment " should absolute or delta . requesting help brings up screen irrelevant topic ( penalties early withdrawal savings ) . * my state return , it dragged me through 3 screens every stock sale i made . ( 20 them - so 60 screens ) . since it already info federal return i doing nothing other than clicking continue over over . much better would present me table all sales ask me check information there . * it transferred information my stock sales my federal my state return . however i only part year resident state it made no attempt either calculate , or warn me , many sales would not taxable events state because they sold when i not resident state . conclusion , while turbo tax ultimately help me get job , i think i'll try going back taxcut next year	-1

i've using quicken windows years . since i recently bought mac , i thought i'd switch quicken over mac windows . forget it ! mac version totally incompatible windows , you must export your data then re-import it mac . this works ok simple checking / visa accounts , but it ** fails completely ** investment or brokerage accounts . if you look quicken support site , they say " reinvest dividend , reinvest income banking transactions investment account must * manually entered * " hello ?! like i'm going manually enter 12 years investment transactions ? most major products ( adobe creative suite , ms office ) , same files work transparently across mac windows . quicken inability even import data , nevermind actually opening it , reeks incompetence . stay away this product	-1

i concur review points up problems adobe new " license manager " method activation . when you pay much you this app , or entire suite , you should not faced complete lockup should you hardware problems , or can't connect internet " location shooting . " i took one star off this egregious marketing tactic . said , this version photoshop superb , otherwise 5-star app . if you take time use tutorials included help ( used separate folders , chapters 1 - 4 classroom book , but no more alas ) , or get one deke mcclelland fine tomes all lessons , there nothing this app novice can't start use day one . today point shoot cameras packing more resolution , more manual control , into their functions , use photoshop becomes more than just hobby . you really " rescue " photos too dark , too bright , exceedingly color-shifted , " cut " folder still make prints . further , camera raw functionality allows anyone sufficiently functional digicam touch up snapshots into fine photography . warning : you need fastest processor you afford ( core duo or quatro superb ) , much ram your system take . there optional performance plug-in which maximizes performance systems more than 1 gigabyte ram . you need least much under windows xp get good performance out ps cs2 . if you use 2gb or more dual-channel memory , that even better ( dual-channel ram adds small boost when handling large file sizes , e.g. camera raw image sources ) . if you don't these , don't expect photoshop act fast . adobe bridge major improvement this version . it offers superior file image management functions , even batch editing images . you even perform camera raw adjustments right bridge . bridge perform batch processes while you edit photoshop . if isn't cool , i don't know what . if you doubt me , check out deke mcclelland photoshop cs2 one-on-one tutorial his chapter using adobe bridge . his video introduction ( included dvd book ) , chapter using customizing bridge , terrific introductions . if you're user versions 5 .

you see other reviews above , studio series history buggy . you also hear lot people saying " this package so much more intuitive easy use than other ' powerful enough worth owning ' packages -- if only it more stable ! " i am one those long-suffering users ( 5 years , going back version 9 ) , finally version 10.6 i stopped complaining -- it now works i'd hoped when i bought it . $300 i spent other packages trying better wasted -- i kept getting frustrated interfaces 500-page manual couldn't clarify . i'm very sophisticated computer user most measures . i am turning all our old family video tapes cd into dvd . i use studio all editing ( not tried dvd recording -- just use roxio ) am now very pleased . if you own 10.5 then version 10.6 free download . one important piece advice would saved me lots problems : put every " project " you work separate subdirectory . if you 5 soccer game videos make /game1 , /game2 etc . series subfolders . if you edit those " jimmy great plays " proect , put it separate /jimmyplays folder . when projects same folder you edit them few times weird overwrite problems happen 10.5 . i learned this trick before 10.6 came out , i don't know if it matters any more but i take no chances . why i stick something where i admit version 9.0 " powerful but unstable " 10.0 " more powerful more unstable " ? because i actually use studio minimal reference instructions , when i use it things turn out i expect . now it become stable reliable i am very satisfied customer . so that how i got frustrated studio customer giving it 4 stars this review . i tell whole story so you understand other reviews frustrated people relevant older versions , but " 10.5 updated free 10.6 " really best choice out there now ... my unused expensive rivals studio my shelf prove . just keep putting every project inn its own folder !	1

i really surprised read some other reviews this product -- it we we've purchased entirely different programs . my experience this software , i've found it extremely smooth-running user-friendly installation printing , card selection customization second none . there perfect cards every occasion date we've customized them countless ways -- adding editing photos , moving text , sending ecards , you name it ! navigating within art studio very intuitive . printing cards sofware very easy on-screen configuration works great . unlike some other reviews , i haven't problem re-configure every time i print . we set it up once it . i've printed card stock paper , which turns out gorgeous , we've also printed quarter-fold plain letter size which also looks great works perfect size a2 envelopes ( this great printing option if you don't want buy card stock paper ! ) . i've used this software all my computers , recommended it many people , so far not yet encountered or heard any problems . i highly recommend it . it fun program , recipients love their customized cards , it save you money long run	1

i using microsoft operating systems very long time , , i still say this best system out there , many reasons . increasing amount linux mac users made claim they more compatible programs , less vulnerable virus hacks . response linux users-stay away linux , linux free reason . it compatible very very few programs it , number only decrease . gamers - rarley i see linux compatible game . just stay away this system . mac users-mac also lesser amount compatible programs . fewer fewer programs run them , like linux , number only decrease . only thing keeping macintosh alive itunes . which compatible windows . besides , when direct 10 comes out , it only available windows , making macintosh un-usable new games when next windows os comes out ( microsoft vista ) . computers also generally more expensive than windows . btw - you get viruses mac 	1
first , if you're thinking using these photos print , you may wish think again . most objects run 300-600 pixels width or height , or 1-2 inches 300 dpi . stretch them bigger than , they'll start blur and/or get jagged . also note , if you try export/save image hemera image browser select 300 dpi setting , browser may stretch graphic larger than it actual size , causing blurring jaggedness right out gate . you need use " use image full size " checkbox when exporting images . if you specify 300 dpi size , don't use checkbox , you'll get stretched image . example , first image collection ( pocket watch ) only 384 pixels wide . if you specify 300 dpi don't check " use image full size " box , software stretch it 642 pixels wide . stretching cause image look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it web site or print project . all said , if you're going use images web , they're great . you get almost all images you'd find their three " photo objects " collections , each which much more expensive than this single collection . difference photo objects collections offer 20-30% higher resolution ( i.e. first image collection 384 pixels wide , but 492 pixels wide photo objects ) you save photo objects images transparent backgrounds ( while this collection forces you specify color background ) . price , this good collection . there lots shots minor variations , so it may seem like duplication , but someone trying get something just right , slightly different tilt head may just what doctor ordered	1
nobody , i mean nobody , could more illustrator novice ignoramus than i . several months ago i given licensed copy illustrator 9 departing coworker used . wanting chance design departmental logo otherwise would've gone agency , i raised my figurative hand volunteered blindly duty . taught myself everything ms-dos turbocad , photoshop elements , not mention word , excel , powerpoint ( don't get me started latter program , argh ) , i figured i could tackle least basics illustrator 9 . loaded it my laptop , took it home weekend .... just lost my sanity -- several fingernails -- trying learn confounding program . i managed produce few logos , one which chosen . but egads , what big , stinky bear illustrator 9 wrestle . when i saw cs2 this live trace feature , i pleaded my workplace santa get it me , wow ! what overall improvement !! illustrator still not intuitive pick up ms office product , but this comes darn close . cs2 , they've given us " hot tips " -- little clues what some tools , pop up when you mouse over tool . intuitive menus nice too . also cool all text paragraph fill stroke features , which used huge boxes taking up valuable real estate screen , now condensed up small horizontal toolbar , like office products ... when you mouse over them , screen tips tell you how expand them . aaaahh ! finally some help dunces like me . live trace live paint unbelieveably cool . very first thing i after loading cs2 grab . jpg photo soccer ball off google images , within 20 minutes , without consulting any book or online help , i'd converted it into simple graphic image painted into 2 colors i wanted . but great guidebook , reviewer who suggested illustrator visual quickstart guide elaine weinmann dead-on . i've bought several other " highly rated " books try help me through confounding quagmire adobe products , so i've seen them all . visual quickstart book doesn't any insufferable " wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author " writing , focuses just basics . it very literal , step-by-step instructions . still there no substitute utterly excruciating process learning illustrator through experience . but weinmann book better than any i've seen yet . only reason i haven't given this product 5 because it still doesn't intuitiveness it needs . way it still " snobby " -- aimed pros , not folks like me who need occasional design stuff but not living . but this far , far , far cry better than illustrator 9 . absolutely worth money , just live trace live paint alone .	1

i installed norton antivirus 2007 immediately after installing windows vista , office 2007 other software new computer . installation ran smoothly . liveupdate ran automatically updated product without hitch . norton antivirus 2007 not only detects viruses , it detects spyware rootkits well . it inbound firewall , apparently some limited outbound firewall capabilities . it not protect against phishing , identity theft , or spam , nor it contain full outbound firewall protection . when installed windows vista , norton antivirus takes over windows defender windows firewall . i not expect latter ; symantec should made it more clear this product includes software firewall . norton antivirus integrates well windows security center . norton antivirus 2007 noticeably quicker both normal operation during full scans than previous versions . norton antivirus always performed well industry comparisons against other antivirus products . only other product i would use myself mcafee virusscan , but i always felt norton antivirus more aggressive job protecting my system . those you installing norton antivirus 2007 upgrade , i would highly recommend you first remove any existing norton security products using add/remove programs control panel . then , download run norton removal tool symantec site make sure it all gone . see comparison chart norton 2007 windows protection products this posting date , browse symantec site , click " norton 2007 products " under home products , click related link " view all products " then click " compare " next pc security .	1

ok , it big ( 4 cdrs ) . full install require over 2.35 gb . but it loads quickly offers nice greeting card variety pretty sophisticated card customization options all pages card . previous years , it also installs event planner . if you don't want use event planner you stop it starting windows going start / all programs / startup group deleting entry event planner startup group but if you don't similar program , you might find event planner useful . i found setting up this program my auto-duplexing ricoh color laser printer easy enough , so setting it up other printers likely pretty easy also . quality printed cards really astounding , even my normally " picky " wife thinks they look very nice acceptable any use . i suppose your results could depend your printer but if your printer currently prints nice graphics pictures , then cards should turn out very nice . i recommend using heavy card stock professional looking final product . cards default printing out 1/4 sheet size ( four fold ) format easily printed 1/2 fold size graphics text remain outstanding . i never experimented " partial install " would require disk swapping but save hd space , so i cannot if would nuisance or not . overall , there nothing i've found program i don't like .	1
i installed it three my computers no problem i used wordperfect before it vey user friendly . i'm not power user but basic things seen easier . i recomended . software came intructional dvd no how used un like microsoft counter par t.t his software more then what needed average person . it also comes some free download installing software your computer which you install all three computers . it come lots template you used . buy , buy , buy i say . lol worth it	1
i remember first time i used wordperfect , first time i used microsoft word . i couldn't imagine why anyone would choose vastly inferior word over wordperfect . years passed , now i find myself using ms word every day . i'd ground down thousands word users who'd picked it up powerpoint excel , who didn't enough savvy know how convert documents one format . wordperfect _always_ converted msword docs . msword never reciprocated . shouldn't told them which program mandate make customer life much easier ? each successive iteration , wordperfect introduced some new innovation , next incarnation , microsoft aped it . it got point where users would nod appreciatively innovation , then wait inevitable year-long interval microsoft catch up , then they'd buy . well , due outrageously fair price point multiuser license , i tried wordperfect x3 , it like coming home . it nothing short amazing . i went out bought copy my parents , they love it , too . now my brother , attorney , asked me buy him copy , since so many federal prosecutors he works wordperfect only , can't seem open his word files . more things change , more they stay same	1

after going insane new version norton systemworks 2005 , which doesn't even install , i decided finally swear off all symantec products . i used zone alarm pro some time . it not perfect , but it certainly protect your computer . i took plunge went full security suite this week , i've relatively happy . plus side , software works really well . personal firewall better than any you find , virus protection found phishing app norton not ( before i unstalled it ) . minus side , firewall problematic . i've page load issues ebay my own site which cgi script keep my images files hotlinked ( bandwidth theft ) . when i visit my site or any other similar anti-theft cgi script , images simply won't come up . ebay gets all messed up well . i haven't able figure out setting works , so i turn off firewall ebay few other sites , which kind defeats purpose firewall . this doesn't happen lot though , so it not annoying enough get my dander up . all all it far better investment than symantec products , so despite its limitations i would recommend this program . it lot options set , but they pretty easy get through if you computer literate . if you decide go this program you currently norton antivirus , you need uninstall norton before this program run . if you ask me if i preferred symantec systemworks or zone alarm security suite , there would absolutely no hesitation recommending zone alarm .	1

office 2007 nice step up office 2003 ( earlier ) it better visuals toolbar . e.g. instead just seeing worded commands toolbar where one clicks command then gets drop down list choose more commands , i.e. file , tools , edit , etc , you'll see tabs different commands toolbar . when clicking tabs , it sets up across toolbar , all functions particular tab . once viewed , you not only see words functions , but also , small example graphs images what functions . this only applies all applications other than outlook , which pretty much retained same look feel 2003the load times seem much quicker than what i 2003 version . outlook , setting up accounts , maintaining names addresses much easier too . only annoying part office 2007 comes mind , one only choose 3 color schemes . three " black " which really looks more like dark taupe or slate color , " blue " which looks more like light powder blue " silver " , which looks like light gray . my honest opinion , i like standard color look like previous versions my taste goes this , i only like black setup only	1

this software focused learning rules game . movement different pieces pawns demonstrated through assortment arcade-type games . there some decent books learning chess beginners , but learning through computer game program makes it much easier more fun . program doesn't contain any instructions , so some people may find it frustrating figuring out what beginning . however , there symbol top right corner , clicking which brings down menu which point navigating becomes piece cake . just knowing rules game enables one play chess , but not exactly win , so second cd this series ( learn play chess 2 ) continues where first one left off goes into different tactics strategies . software recommended 8 year-old children older - kids heart may fun learning chess this program also	1

i purchased panda internet security 2007 two reasons : price after rebates ( free ) fact it 3-user license . after switching mcafee norton ( subsequent 1-year renewal ) i decided either buy pc-cillin 2007 or try panda . ( 39.99 or free ... hmm ... ) i installed panda my laptop first ( after uninstalling norton internet security 2005 ) . no problem what-so-ever . initial hdd scan , panda found cleaned 5 files found my email inbox identified worm . i then installed panda 2 desktop machines no problems there either . panda found 3 traces spyware one machine nothing second . panda boots up windows xp quickly . it only given me couple pop-up messages ( one wifi intrusion , which computer my network ... i accepted it it never came back . other pop-up start on-line customer service or something like ... i declined it it yet come back . ) my laptop p4 1.8 ghz , 1gb ram , 32mb ati video , 40gb hdd . initial virus scan took less than 20 minutes , scanning over 250,000 files . not bad ! desktop 1 first scan ( p4 2.4 ghz , 512mb , 128mb video , 120gb hdd ) scanned nearly 300,000 files also under 20 minutes . desktop 2 quickest ( p4 3.4 ghz , 1gb , 128mb video , 80gb hdd ) scanning over 330,000 files 15 minutes . i am extremely impressed panda internet security 2007 . it everything i hoped it would . i would definitely recommend this product others	1
if you don't need outlook but need powerpoint , this great value . before , you student or teacher get good price ( full retail $150 now ) . office 2003 standard even ebay still going $175 plus . this not offer anything much beyond office 2003 but new ribbon format not difficult learn . also , don't worry file formats . you re-set default format prior formats so anything you send out read earlier versions microsoft office .	1
i windows xp which came mcafee . i used both norton mcafee but lately mcafee updates seem giving other users lot trouble . rather than updating anti-virus definitions , etc ., i decided try zone alarm where many users seem like it . i must say moment i installed it only problem i ran you completely unistall your current antivirus , firewall , etc . if zonealarm work . date software worked beautifully . actually , i believe my computer runs smoother slightly faster . i definately would upgrade or buy this product again . check some sellers bargain prices . i bought mine 19.99 , which big savings zonealarm website . it worth every penny	1
why buy upgrade when you buy full version ? basically cause it cheap . you see , old version , new version , 10.4.6 , 10 , 4 , 8 so . i just bought old version installed latest update . now i am up date lot less money which meant i could spend extra cash more software my mac . far performance , no faster than jaguar or panther . benchmarks say faster but if you stare screen any version , 10 nano seconds you save not noticable . you encounter drive issues some point this version appears issues more often . this seems due new journaling scheme but i cannot back this up . if possible i recommend you erase drive you installing . disk utility , select erase tab , then security button , select zero out data option . note : you cannot erase drive but only volume . this clear out any corrupt data pinpoint any bad or damaged sectors . main reason i wanted this widgets . they blessing . calculator , thesarus , package tracking , many more . tiger only comes dozen widgets but widget configuration button , you see more widgets option . you directed hundreds others widgets immediate free installation . my favorite weather radar widget i work outdoors lot . i am able quickly see latest radar plan my week , all press f12 . no need interupt what i am doing mac widgets pop up my layout my activities stay active . click any area other than widget they hide away . if you want wait version osx allows you write your own widgets without taking programming course , wait leopard	1
before buying quickbooks you should google : quickbooks 2007 simple start free starter edition . this free version never times out . you immediately download 400m or get cd no shipping charge . big limit free upgradeable version you only get 20 total customers vendors , so it ideal students those limited needs	1
i used quickbooks basic number years both my church my business . i kept qb 2004 basic since upgrades not immediately necessary me . i chose upgrade this year keep current maintenance , etc . so again i chose most basic product offered - " simple start " . i received it just fine it installed perfectly . however , it not upgrade any previous qb files . i investigated , intuit says it won't upgrade files previous qb versions their web site ( albeit small print ) product box itself , but not ever mentioned amazon listing . so then i upgrade next higher version - additional $80 . qb pro also works very well ; it just shame intuit insists misleading customers not providing full information through all marketing channels . intuit phone rep also tried overcharge me $20 upgrade but quickly accepted correct amount when i pointed out their error second time .	1
i started norton ghost 2003 many years ago problems backing up clone images . acronis true image backup 9.0 simple user interface works well . i used it re-image my son computer without any problems . it good product price . i highly recommend making backup image your hard drive weekly basis	1

i understand software companies strive give new versions their products " new " or " better " appearances but my opinion toos defaults should recognizable version version much possible . i used versions corel since coreldraw ! 3 i just moved x3 10 find trace tool works better but mechanism somewhat cryptic . i would great sympathy buyer using it first time if they never used older version simply because i could only figure it out through past knowledge trial error . results great but methodology lacks some intuitiveness past versions . pallettes far less comprehensive thn version 10 pallettes . i truly wish i version 8 pantone pallette back even though it incomplete it so much better layed out . i never understand why black one end pallette white other , waste time ... tools all there but they appear different . i went work x3 fright away found i could work effectively day one but i resort version 10 ( which i kept my system ) few times first week perform operations i coupdn't figure out x3 which simple 10 . help files circuitous , apparently never actually getting point . line tutorials great absolute novice but useless anyone who actually worked vector art before . export ai still little inaccurate even after all these years . ( you cannot select line terminus expect it there ai ) eps export filter doesn't always want readable adobe either . price excellent , product spectacular its own right i am happy my purchase . i expected little more this version than i got but no less than i additional compatibility . i still need copy illustrator my machine deal people who only program	1
i am average when it comes design , but tutorial helped me creating logo it cheaper better me create one myself than pay someone it . i like tracing feature which allows you remove parts photo place new background . get most out this software you really need familiar lot features already , there lot i am missing . i just take more time keep practicing learning trial error	1

i received this product using it couple weeks . it exactly advertised . it very easy use software extremely user friendly . i am amazed quality recordings . i would definately recommend this product	1
what i like this software it not come too many " gadgets . " my age , i am " technically challenged . " so this software worked out fine me my limited computer skills . i also like fact this software covers castilian spanish . it probably only course available exclusively covers castilian spanish such depth since pimsleur learning like crazy only offer latin american spanish courses . downside this software you not learn much spanish grammar it . if you want learn rules mechanisms required combine words form sentences spanish , you buy good spanish grammar book . i strongly recommend spanish grammar independent learners avigail azoulay , arie vicente . it more expensive than other spanish grammar books but it well worth money .	1

i received my emedia piano keyboard method today it not bad program any means , however i two gripes software : first , either " full screen " option preferences doesn't work or emedia feels 640x480 counts full screen , so if you your monitor set higher resolution ( what mac user doesn't ? ) you'll need lower it order read lessons ' text , since you most likely won't sitting close your laptop/monitor during these lessons , this kind important . second , you need program cd your computer get sound video play , whine my optical drive mildly annoying while trying study/practice . there workarounds bypass this type copyright protection silliness , but it makes me mad i need resort doing this . if emedia so paranoid theft their product , why don't they just stream program media portion their website ? least it wouldn't noisy way . other than these two flaws , program excellent self-starters like me . plus it seems only complete , low-cost piano/keyboard instruction software out there mac osx . i would wrote this review after few weeks lessons instead my first day learning but optical-drive issue really bothered me .	1
this cd must ! you cannot afford not buy it . information comprehensive easy follow . format perfectly set up ... you review section many times if needed . every family individual america should view this cd know what when terrorist attack occurs ... not if , but when , it occurs . instance , before watching this cd i no idea you could use regular household items like dish soap or bleach remove radioactive materials your skin , but these items make chemical burns worse . i feel much better this knowledge cd , this just one example useful critical information i learned . preparation checklists cd awesome planning ahead . knowledge powerful protecting yourself your family event attack	1
i'm hobbyist musician like home recordings . this program fits all my basic needs . this first piece audio software i've ever owned but i know lot people who more experienced very unhappy what i guess unconventional layouts commands so warned if you've used audition 1.5 or cooledit . however , my introduction music editing , control scheme seems very intuitive me i like endless options adobe provides organizing workspace . one tip : if you student or teacher , don't spend $300 ; google search find site sells this product little over $100 .	1

used office programs some time , i bit put off new ribbons which replace old menus . i guess office needed new look , but i am not sure if i buy advertising ribbon make my work more productive . some things you should know office 2007 ultimate general . licensing agreement allows you install office 2007 ultimate two computers , one them laptop . i found this clause legal agreement even called microsoft legal confirm . if you make modifications quick access toolbar ( who won't ? ) you want take these changes you computer , files toolbars located : :\d ocuments settings\username\local settings\application data\microsoft\officewhere username your username . something i found handy when working my two computers . one thing i don't like file name extensions changed . gone familiar . doc word documents . now file extension . docx . if you want create document still opened prior versions word , you must purposefully choose create . doc file , but you lose some functionality new files . . docx file this format not same opendocument standard . microsoft promises older versions word still open . docx files , but i not tried it i don't buy into everything microsoft promises until i see it happen . why couldn't microsoft just leave files same they always ? office 2007 look slick i anticipate i warm up it future i get used new command structure .	1
i'm pc mechanic . i using ad-aware ad-watch ( now called ad-aware plus ) last 5 years . it pretty good what it , but there newer technology going replace it soon . i've never any problems these program - it not add any malware - it removes it . however , using ad-aware ad-watch their fullest take some computer savvy - it seems any anti-malware market these days . all other runtime problems other reviewers here reported " fixable " using controls tweaks software , so you not overprotecting your system - one example , pop-up blocker ad-watch adjustable its intensity . however , this requires changing two settings - one ad-watch itself one ad-aware . , yes , times , i turn ad-watch off download file or see popup i wanted . soooo ? software these days not " automatic " companies would you believe . if you're not willing take time learn ( which also means going company online user forums asking questions ) , just stick what windows offers , don't use outlook or outlook express ( major source malware pcs ) only look websites you know safe .

i bought this use family photos threw together my first 5 page comic last night . it fairly easy use , but not perfect . instructions thin ( read ' mostly nonexistant ' ) ; so it best you either time your hand or lot experience using complex photo software . good : simple once you get hang it . plenty fixed comic book panel formats chose drag-and-drop photo application makes life very easy . long you ok formats provided , then putting family photos into fun comic book format incredibly easy . i received rave reviews my first ' comic ' finished product exceptional quality . sofware nice assortment boxes , call-outs even some fun clip art . this great buy price . not good : learning curve steep due quirky layout controls . i guess this not too bad issue since there few controls provided software . " dude " who wrote instructions flippant best ( really annoying if you want find basic answer ) definitely not paid produce quality product . downloading photos tough until i found out trick - after , it quite easy . bad : no photo editing software included . simple things like rotating photos 90 degrees prior loading into comic book creator . instructions " comic book wizard " close useless . i mention controls ? they basic ( good bad ) poorly laid out ( bad ) . there no ability truly customize panel layouts ; so this software not help out if you want something really creative . ( diagonals , overlays more . ) all-in-all , this excellent buy software package under $20 . i created great storyboard format some fun memories - bringing great laugh ( few " wows " ) my family , grandparents friends . just aware there learning curve get over before you hit fun stuff . if software more expensive , then i would given it 3 stars	1

i've working punch as/4000 since 10.0 released ( 12 months ago ) . although i agree many respects positive reviews . example , there large feature list . however , there issues software . example : - hard coded limitations software design ( e.g. four possible scale options printing , not support grid snap smaller than 3/8 " or 10mm - which seriously complicates moving things around drawing any degree precision , very tiny dimension text windows , etc . )- inaccuracies : i printed 1:100 scale drawing came out 1:94 approximately ; - i couldn't fit scale house drawing 8.5 11 paper , no print preview ; - there limitations inconsistencies dimensions ( i.e. placement , snap geometry , etc . )- powertools seem series independently developed add modules don't necessarily conform application interface ( e.g. precision , look feel , functionality)- elevation editor very limited . it basically provides visual representation drawing some editing texture applications- can't differentiate exterior wall treatments independently wall surface ( e.g. brick siding same floor ) . - object library very limited plumbing fixtures , furniture , windows , etc . common items aren't library nor they easy find . ( you create them yourself though ) . - 3d object editor ok but not terribly intuitive . - multi-floor buildings get complicated work once you add floors or ceilings . - once you add objects , drawings get big slow very quickly . - import/export limitedin short as/4000 could use overhaul , updated object library , major upgrade scale printing overall clean-up create more integrated functional product . also , incorporate user feedback into future releases	1

this software came scanner i recently purchased i decided upgrade " se " (striped edition ? )that bundled device . considering cost what software it amazing value . simply using this software re-create documents instead retyping them saving me more hour or two day . i hesitant puchse it based upon all recent negative reviews , but decided 30 day refund policy i could try it risk free . i'm glad i . software worked flawlessly me - even 5th 6th generation copies hard read my naked eye ( i don't need or wear glasses ) . i'm not sure what those people scanning books trying accomplish , but when i scanned some pages encyclopedia my son ocr worked great ! try it if it doesn't work then return it .	1

i started off using turbotax this year , but returned it store use taxcut instead . i purchased this version because it bargain , it easy enough state taxes hand ( or free state website those states option ) . i some difficulty update process , which frustrating first . however , i found taxcut website helpful this point , i determined my firewall problem . i able update product once i followed their instructions . one key difference turbotax taxcut taxcut not integrated many companies . whereas i could automatically download my w-2 most my 1099 forms into turbotax , they needed manually entered taxcut . this wasn't huge issue , but one difference people might want know . i completed e-filed multiple federal returns , which worked great , e-file charge reasonable ( $15.95 ) . however , i don't suggest e-file charge taken out your refund . apparently , there extra charge ( i think $25 ) this service . it more efficient less expensive just pay fee credit card . now software itself . i found it easy navigate enter information . i bit disappointed deduction section . many fields too short me enter complete names addresses charities , which i found frustrating . however , calculations accurate . i checked taxcut calculations regarding amt , they excellent ( turbotax calculations wrong ) . second return i completed , taxpayer eligible eic , taxcut accurately identified this proper calculations here well . overall , i very satisfied product , use it again next year . i make suggestions taxcut , hope they improve their support automatic download forms longer fields charitable deductions . however , even without these changes , product exceptional value	1

this good software casual use ( hiking , biking , geocaching ) , but not without issues . positive side , it definitely beats all non-digital ( scanned usgs maps ) alternatives . level details good enough(how many us need know topography down 5 feet ? ) . fact maps digitally generated ( vectors i believe ) makes all labels clear any scale . it two advantages over its main " digital " competitor , ng topo . first , all us one dvd price separate state/region cds ng . second , it available . i could not even find ng northeast edition anywhere web ! one might think nh me some obscure corners globe not big tourist destinations . now few negatives . exchange feature gps flaky . sometimes it takes several tries unplugging replugging cable restarting program before it recognizes my garmin . part it could low mid range gps still serial connection not truly plug-and-play even com-to-usb adapter ( beats me why garmin can't make all their gps usb this day age ) . any case , regardless whose fault it , it annoying times not able connect two smoothly . second problem i noticed 3-d window . it clearly consumes lot memory crashes my laptop if i lot rapid rescaling . i ended up just closing window , since it pretty much " coolness " not add any real topographical value . finally , i problem delorme service . i purchased it amazon rebate offer . however , month after submitting necessary info i received card delorme stating bar code i sent not upc code . box only one bar code it so i am not sure how i could made mistake . they requested i send correct one , but code cut out gone , how they expect me come up one ?! i feel little bit like cheap way out paying rebate but $20 not worth time arguing them over it . i would interested hear if anyone else experienced same problem .	1

after removing symantec installing zonealarm my computer speeded up factor least 10 . i'm not certain why symantec slows some computers down but leaves others going fast -in my case it insisted scanning every program transferred used scanning every outgoing email even though i truned those features off . i recommend zonealarm users some expertise - during initial usage you need understand what programs allow what block ( look them up google )	1
given this stripped down version some sonic foundry more powerful ( expensive ) professional tools , acid music 3.0 still pleasant surprise . i it set up my computer within ten minutes , very little tutoring instruction guide , able browse music loop library , " paint " out loops multi-track display , modify loop characteristics like reverb bass , so forth . obviously , acid music 3.0 doesn't easily stand alone . this software cannot generate its own unique loops , so i wound up find midi program would let me create original loops making truly original music . but non-musician who hosts radio program bona fide electronic music fan , acid music 3.0 made it super easy assemble my midi tracks into pretty good sounding pieces . i would recommend this program anyone , musician or non-musician , interested breaking into world digital computer music creation . it almost three months since my wife gave me my copy gift , i've managed put together many different kinds pieces music , using both original content great loops come program . it lot fun , me hungering see what more i thing	1

i concur review points up problems adobe new " license manager " method activation . when you pay much you this app , or entire suite , you should not faced complete lockup should you hardware problems , or can't connect internet " location shooting . " i took one star off this egregious marketing tactic . said , this version photoshop superb , otherwise 5-star app . if you take time use tutorials included help ( used separate folders , chapters 1 - 4 classroom book , but no more alas ) , or get one deke mcclelland fine tomes all lessons , there nothing this app novice can't start use day one . today point shoot cameras packing more resolution , more manual control , into their functions , use photoshop becomes more than just hobby . you really " rescue " photos too dark , too bright , exceedingly color-shifted , " cut " folder still make prints . further , camera raw functionality allows anyone sufficiently functional digicam touch up snapshots into fine photography . warning : you need fastest processor you afford ( core duo or quatro superb ) , much ram your system take . there optional performance plug-in which maximizes performance systems more than 1 gigabyte ram . you need least much under windows xp get good performance out ps cs2 . if you use 2gb or more dual-channel memory , that even better ( dual-channel ram adds small boost when handling large file sizes , e.g. camera raw image sources ) . if you don't these , don't expect photoshop act fast . adobe bridge major improvement this version . it offers superior file image management functions , even batch editing images . you even perform camera raw adjustments right bridge . bridge perform batch processes while you edit photoshop . if isn't cool , i don't know what . if you doubt me , check out deke mcclelland photoshop cs2 one-on-one tutorial his chapter using adobe bridge . his video introduction ( included dvd book ) , chapter using customizing bridge , terrific introductions . if you're user versions 5 . ( i ) , 6 , or 7 , upgrading cs2 no-brainer . don't wait . get it now before adobe license manager gets worse 2007	1
i upgraded version 5 . i don't use very many features . but big difference i see , files sizes seem greatly reduced . something i would scan 10mb , now might 2mb . this just opinion , nothing scientific . interface takes some getting used , bit different . overall price ($99 - less $20 rebate ) , great deal	1

great sw , easy learn , good graphics . really helps visualize space when you see it 3d . could improved if numerous similar objects could selected changed simultaneously ( e.g. , windows , doors , cabinets get all same materials , colors , hardware rather than one time - very labor intensive ) . should warn users select/create style then copy/paste them where needed . also , difficult ( maybe impossible , because i haven't figured out how it ) change room's/house overall style once you start given design	1

i downloaded demo this program although i am no means pro photographer i over 4,000 digital photographs my family i am taking new photos each day . addition i post my photos pbase so family friends always see latest photos . i started looking into digital asset management after i started fall behind updates pbase photo website because time consuming process managing my collection . case you not looked , there products out there such idimager , imatch , extensis porfolio , many more . i downloaded demos imatch iview media pro used each only briefly . although imatch costs only $49.00 or so iview costs 3x more ( around $160 ) i chose iview because i felt interface just easier use . course this says nothing features each product i am not attempting feature feature comparison because i don't time . i think imatch excellent product few features i am looking appeared available both products . i recommend anyone looking purchase software attempt download demo first	1

i'm not spider-man fan . i love powers , ultimates , supreme power , planetary other stuff warren ellis , brian michael bendis , et.al . so when i bought this , i wondered if spending whopping $49 would worth it . i wanted read straczynski recent run spider-man , but if i going spend $20 graphic novel , why not spend little more whole thing . that just what you get . addition getting straczynski 4-year run ( which includes spider-man evolution discovery his totemic powers ) , you get everything leading up june 2006 ( which just like 3 issues ago ! ) . all 1 dvd-rom . true , cons when it comes crossovers , you only get amazing spider-man stories reading it off your computer isn't fun reading actual comics -- but doesn't compare getting entire run . it like complaining getting free ps3 , xbox360 nintendo wii , because box didn't come it or you're missing one controller . $50 may seem steep , but if comics cost $3 now , so price like one or two months worth comics -- or 2 books , you get everything . it true , you just print out pages if you want ( so if you want abuse your office or school printer , go it !	1

any e-dictionary give you definitions course , but what i especially like this one it lightning fast . also , when definition contains illustration it indicated icon which you double click view ( which comes up instanteously seperate window ) . this dictionary also allows you search word different criteria other than just its definitions : rhymes , homophones , date , author quoted , definition contains ... etc , etc . one note installation : make sure you temporarily disable active virus software ( it wouldn't hurt same those other programs right side task bar )	1

first , after reading reviews below , i noticed only one person(merrifield winters ) doesn't like this suite . upon noticing he seattle(microsoft hometown ) , i decided look his other reviews . according mr. winters , he purchases extensively uses each version wordperfect office , even after saying each one worthless . he also seems glowing complements microsoft products . this tends make me think mr. winters paid or voluntary basher . my experience cpa , i used both wordperfect ms office day-to-day basis , both word processing spreadsheets , i found wordperfect makes product many innovations then copied year later microsoft office . i guess they save lot this way . also , wp much more intuitive new users . i some clients start ms office , only give up due its complexity lack explanations . i suggested wp them , they found it easy follow . only time i use ms office when i am supervising client their office , while i am complaining it .	1

using turbo tax past 7 or 8 years . when quicken , their wisdom , decided no longer support win98 i thought i'd give taxcut try . worked great simple interview process . i think i'll just stick them now due their thoughtfulness . even when i upgrade doing my taxes upgraded computer	1
i previsouly used accountant my s-corp ( federal , state nyc ) returns well ( federal state ) personal returns . easily come $1000 . turbotax you save bunch around $750 . business product not include state return which $50 , nyc return additional $50 ( available inside program ) . i used it first time this year , i am pretty good numbers , accounting excel . it tool me well over 10 hours enter business returns after all my numbers estimated excel . customer support email helpful community forum , but responses not always quick . it time consuming process research questions . very little guidance filling out state nyc return . tt basically gives you form let you fill areas not generated numbers federal return . tt reviews those returns errors which certainly adds some value ( relative pencil paper ) . it too difficult me fill state nyc myself off fed business return without any software , so i don't see option ( save $100 ) despite limited additional information needed . bottom line - first year using it probably cause some your hair turn grey , subsequent years should much easier . navigation interface not intuitive enough make first year smoot but over years you save substancially preparing you own taxes . one strategy might try it one year run it tax accountant ( training wheels ) then subsequent years it your own . ( course year one would time consuming expensive but probably makes sense long run .	1
i usually dread installing patching turbo tax . this my 8th year using them past it headache get latest updates sometimes . this smooth process . it self updates , downloads patches , applies them tells you when module you using still going updated later date ( gives you expected date too ) . i found this version operate just like all others , but update experience what really impressed me	1
this product met our needs ver well every year we've used it . we used online only version last year , it slow clunky ( we couldn't pick up right where we'd left off ) . but ... desktop version great ! faster than ever compared earlier years , no tax category overlooked personal or business . we ran it mac os 10.4.9 . buy confidence	1
i reading these reviews while wondering whether or not i should upgrade my laptop pc vista . would i upgrade success story , or would i one disgruntled reviewers whose pc now performs like chimp ? there only one way find out . i bought my laptop month before vista released , so i entitled order free upgrade home premium toshiba . i made order one day , faxed my proof purchase day after , my upgrade dvd arrived two weeks later . i am satisfied how fast they sent me package . anyway , back vista . i'd read reviews , took good comments bad ones , used vista upgrade advisor , which told me all my hardware compatible vista i'd remove some software drivers . i everything i told . all i now keep my fingers crossed hope bes t.t he upgrade dvd contained link exe file launched help wizard would guide me through updating my bios removing incompatible drivers before launching vista installation . ( i upgrade , not clean install . ) i didn't anything -- just let wizard uninstall programs reboot computer when necessary . it involved no intervention my part . then came actual installation vista . it quick painless ( one hour ) , no blue screens death or lockups . so far , so good . when vista launched , things little crazy first , os recognizing new hardware toshiba help wizard installing new drivers . things went little awry this point because help wizard stayed stuck driver wouldn't install . it would reboot try install same driver again when it should moved next one . so i exited wizard decided install drivers myself ( i already saved most them cd ) . installing most those drivers hadn't necessary after all , microsoft already installed most those drivers anyway . os felt clunky first , which meant some intervention needed . i removed some applications startup , managed gadgets my sidebar , tweaked it around until vista worked my needs . it now runs smoothly . despite my laptop only 1 gb ram , it purrs like kitten . sometimes os resource hog , but not enough render pc useless . i haven't much opportunity use all it take advantage its features , but this what i like so far : * interface . it actually prettier than mac os ( which i also own ) . aero glass very easy eye . i also like 3-d flip live thumbnails taskbar . i like look alt + tab thumbnails much more than ones windows xp . * search bar star menu . course , we already mac os , but it nice finally it windows well . i'm lazy i don't like look stuff so this tool very useful attractive me . * i like it more multimedia friendly than previous versions , including windows xp media center edition . i am able burn dvds cds create movie montages much more ease . ( though this tool user-friendlier mac . )* i like windows mail . it looks nicer seems more secure than microsoft outlook . * it seems more secure . windows defender comes bundled os now . i hope this os resist malware little better than its predecessor . * names processes running task manager much clearer now . you get names software not just jargon like ehtray . exe , which you don't know what it unless you google it . * network connections much easier handle . my laptop now picks up my home network moment computer boots up . i look connection sign xp , but now i go straight browsing internet vista . there , like all windows oss , cons well : * i detest whole cancel/allow thing . they ask me whether i want access something i've just clicked ! windows gone cautious downright paranoid . cancel/allow feature could useful tool case unwanted application tries access my computer , but prompting me every time i click program , program i've clicked numerous times , just annoying hell . ugh . * i didn't like huge desktop icons . so i right-clicked switched classic view . * i lucky find anti-virus software compatible vista uses flawless real-time protection gratis ( avast ! antivirus ) , but i haven't lucky finding compatible third-party firewall . neither comodo firewall pro nor zonealarm ( free or pro ) , my two favorite firewalls , order , released vista ready product . ( they both claim working it . ) i am stuck using windows firewall now . i refuse use norton or mcafee internet suites . they resource hogs overhyped products . also , i've heard they buggy vista . * this os still comes typical windows nuisances i hate , like leaving folders registry keys after uninstalling program . i hoped they'd found way fix , but no suck luck . i still manually remove program leftovers . i guess macs always far cleaner than pcs regard . * this " innovation " doesn't feel so innovative when you've using most same features years now . mac os all this stuff long time now , so " wow ! " factor doesn't apply me . usual , instead feeling microsoft created something unique , i feel more like they finally caught up everything else out there , not only mac linux , but other companies like google mozilla . all insight i now . i edit review i continue use it . all all , windows vista vast improvement previous installments it lovely eye candy boot . i love ahead technology i'm relieved finally this my laptop . ( even more relieved i didn't pay arm leg it . ) i know i'll repeating this whole process again release leopard my macbook pro . i also ubuntu , kubuntu dreamlinux play around live cds . i love seeing what out there . potential buyers/upgrade hopefuls , all i say if you want upgrade vista , give it whirl . don't let negative reviews scare you -- instead , you should learn their experiences . use some common sense , best your abilities least , make sure use upgrade advisor before you install it . good luck ! :	1

i using mac os 10.3 really long time , it running very slow since 75 percent my hard drive consists itunes stuff . i don't know how it happens but it i decided upgrade version 10.4 it definently worth it . installation process doesn't take too long but it isn't two seconds either once you get it all going , it keeps your mac exactly same it runs quicker speed which great , it added feature things called widgets which great because they very helpful daily life , when you wake up , you click area widgets time comes up weather 6 day forecast my favorite feature flight tracker feature because i lot flying so now i don't log airtran website , i look widget it gives me all flight info , like time or delayed . so i say you get it , or miss out fun	1

i've using graphics apps since they invented i remember well who first invent new features major drawing apps . old days illustrator almost no market share because , well lets just say it no market share . it my humble opinion most difficult program learn use i ever seen . freehand contrast adroit , thus it all market share mac platform instants always united press internationals world standard . release version 7 freehand macromedia announced order reduce apps growing tool set they would now build controls into objects . perhaps this why some neophyte reviewers think coreldraw knockoff freehand but point fact this corels original innovation version one corel draw many many years before freehand copied it . some illustrators newest features like ability add spot colors bitmap version 3 or earlier corel package . draw first program offer true transparent vector objects , gradient transparency vector or raster objects , interactive controls draws vector lens effects simply incomparable . list could go days . corel draw today far most capable app world . it feature set unapproached illustrator . it output any device always flawless my money it lightyears ahead	1

it late night this quick review based my experience vista business . i've only used product week . first , i'm experienced pc user like always keep up date latest hardware . i reluctant upgrade vista first because it didn't support my online postage provider software ( so i thought ) well game i play ( that now supported , but wasn't first ) . one big thing held me back upgrade microsoft sure loves confuse customer . until i ran upgrade advisor i no clue vista home premium upgrade couldn't used upgrade xp pro without clean install . end i go this version . i normally refuse upgrade os without doing clean install first . that very good reason ! one last thing i don't like vista you can't vista clean install upgrade without first installing xp . why this ? so , i opened box put disc after removing several programs startup such my anti-virus program . upgrade went perfectly fine i ran into no problems all . i never once asked driver disc . really . first i surprised how much background hard drive activity there first even when system not doing anything . i fixed disabling some things vista run background . seemed help i don't experience this much anymore . overall , programs seem run just fast they xp . maybe little slower , but i haven't noticed much all . all my old programs ran fine . my online postage software , internet security software even my video capture program . so far i haven't found anything hasn't run properly , but that'll probably change soon . i however one graphical glitch . there weird halo effect around my mouse pointer . it seemed clear up little bit when i installed some new nvidia beta drivers my 7800gt . it still occurs , but rarely . i also some problems windows switcher randomly going non-3d mode . i didn't realize first it not work 3d mode without aero theme enabled . i don't understand why this . truly honest , i'm generally not fan microsoft products . i'll use them that it . i really thought i'd hate vista , but i actually like it .. lot actually . sorry sound like commercial , but i really enjoy using it . i really no clue why it so expensive though ! price way too high . basic edition priced ok , but i don't get why other versions cost so much more . i'm sure i'll come up some bad things say eventually . few things annoying , but i fix them little work . i'm quite annoyed default you can't delete or save root directory : without special permission . no big deal . backup feature nice . i currently my entire drive backed up every morning 8am through windows task scheduler . there no " easy " way this . i some checking online settings add this task scheduler . i also found it strange other got i received error message saying i couldn't edit video external drive without copying it my main drive first ! hopefully i figure out why this occured . something i fix quickly i hope . overall , i like it lot . i definitely wouldn't bother installing it computer that over year old though . i imagine it would pretty slow .	1

this great set cool old marvel comics , which , i think , somewhat associated marvel editor ralph machio . problem i , some covers not original comics . they're marvel masterworks reprints editions . spider-man avengers seem include all original covers ... but ... x-men #s 1 though 7 look like heck ( not don ) . they missing all very nice half-tone blends toned grays apparent all early marvel comics . insides look pretty good . they've photoshopped make borders gutters white - which fine , i guess . but i like look yellowed cheap newsprint ( inside panels ) , because that what old comics made ... if you spend lot time perusing these gems ... i'll bet you almost smell old paper mildew	1
i am 100% satified product price . we used program gps guide us destination point it works great .	1
i've used quicken since around 2004-2005 , upgraded each new release . quicken 2007 not without few bugs quirks , but nonetheless served worthy upgrade me , i certainly not dismal experience some reporting . primary change 2007 interface . it just much easier me find run reports this version . i also love cash flow feature integrated calendar , where you set up known income expenses monitor your cash flow . just great tool . i also found it easy set up accounts integrate credit card statements . i not yet set up investments or mortgage but that next step . there few quirks . couple times i've clicked button program just closed . also , i reinstall product one point because automated account setup screen kept popping up every time i started program ( actually underlying reason why i reinstall b/c i bit hasty set up some things incorrectly ; once i figured out what i'd i decided it just easier start scratch ) . but reinstall seem solve problem setup screen . only thing i say i don't like program when you register , control buttons entry not allow you see next line item registry . few times i've looking specific expense it hidden just b/c i so happened entry above it . however this relatively minor issue . short , if you're happy quicken 2006 then you probably don't need spend money upgrade this point . but if you've found some reporting other features little cumbersome figure out , then 2007 solves this problem much cleaner interface	1
gt legends racing simulation based fia gtc tc leagues . what this means you get real world , present day tracks old school autos tear around them . graphics very good sound amazingly good decent sound system . trck selection very good varied . same said car selection . game heavy realism so if you fan arcade racers it may not you . though there career type mode where you run short championships unlock tracks earn money new cars la gran turismo . this system heavily criticized sim enthusiasts but it gives game sense purpose truthfully its lot fun well . if you don't like it you search gt legends forums fix unlocks everything without championships . play this game steering wheel must . although you set it up keyboard or controller neither game justice . any steering wheel but i would recommend one least shifter because it just doesn't feel right using panel shifters these old cars , frankly its alot fun pumping clutch changing gears . if you force feed back wheel then you treat it really adds game . multiplayer component easy use although there doesn't seem alot activity . might somthing time zones if you visit gt legends forums there plenty posts online races . just find good group race i guess . overall i would recommend this game anyone who really likes racing games	1
this pretty good program creating partitions ; little difficult use off bat , but fairly easy learn	1
i gotten tired paying continual price increases symantec so i searched partition maker . finding acronis i tried it liked it . only drawback keeps me giving it 5 instructions bit clunky - not clear all cases . other than , it excellent value	1
it much easier navigate than 2003 ribbon excellent . ohter features speed up process word , excell powerpoint . way go bill gate	1
using these programs years . they make whole process pretty easy . i like owning program so i easily open my electronic tax files future not rely obtaining access previous year programs thru web servers	1
this software isn't actually your excellent version notation software , but what i mean this : there nothing out there you get this cheaply works this well . if you composing orchestra , you need pay few hundred dollars get real thing , because finale songwriter can't notate orchestra , but if you just trying write down some basic music your own enjoyment or if you trying make your band music look more official , this software you . kid , this something i buy my own money easily compared hundreds dollars i would save get real deal , this provides everything i need write band songs or duets friends . it easy use , it not require one study manual hours understand . even friends mine who not know how read music fair amount luck creating what they want it	1
this cd so much useful information , great deal it i not even considered . usually i glean one or two things i get book ( cd ) makes it good useful , this many things i found useful . it format easy follow i could skip over parts i not find useful . some sections more geared military personnel or foreign diplomats , but i guess i could use some strategies if i traveling overseas ? some it also basic common sense , but if there ever emergency , it would good it refer just sure we not forget something . i also think some more useful if we already attacked i would not use many strategies today . i kept waiting part where it would say buy lots guns hide cash gold coins , but there none . overall , there so many things here i not thought , it presented without lot fluff -- just facts -- organized , easy , comprehensice manner . i would highly recommend it entire family	1
we've using this program our business year now . i find it easy use good value money . we used it create invoices our customers , keep track our checkbook , easy access amount our sales each month , quarter year more . i would recommend it small businesses starting out .	1
i highly recommend new microsoft office . works very well vist	1
i used norton years . after all it industry standard , but after it let many virus slip through ; i enough . i knew i would not get mcafee i repaired many computers mcaffee past ( working computer field . ) so i checked all ratings saw trend micro kaspersky best all ratings . i dediced go trend micro since their software edged out kaspersky . well two years later i not looked back . i got trojan recently , but i called free tech support trend micro ( they only antivirus company offers that)- they bailed me out . they very helpful , spent lot time me , etc . after following few quick instructions i back business my computer clean whistle . when i norton , i would email them or charged $40 phone call after their software let virus . talk nerve . no more , trend micro head shoulders above rest	1
it seemed like it took forever install this software . after properly uninstalling my previous software ( norton ) all its registry enteries , i began installation . my initial problem i own 3 computers , running pc-cillin one one them , i problems registering this software .... even though this its own serial number . it rather amusing i purchased multi pack ... registration process makes no allowance those us which own multiple computers . 2 days later i am still waiting fix . rest installation easy ... it tiresome ( i live rural area use dial-up ) . all smooth install except lack error message , when line noise dropped connection ( i not figure this out until after i performed my first scan informed i not most recent version anti-virals ) . decent gui interface , but clunky . i would rather development money goes into software anyway . if you new user it might more confusing ... but quick start guide reasonably set out ... once you figure out order quickstart guide different than order program interface . i am reminded what norton used like before it sold out marketing companies/spyware/greyware providers without telling us consumers . i would recommned this anyone . my only caution read directions before jumping into install . but shouldn't even experienced users ? i just wish quickstart guide checklist same order interface . i am confident because my past experience i get registration problem fixed ... when someone who native english speaker reads my email customer service . dont bother calling phone number , accents staff it just goes call center outside usa ( probably india )	1
good product but when they going fix screen says you not upgraded ! ! ! ! it drives me nutz pop up every time i go quicken online . i written i'm sure others but still it there no way remove it even after " registering " my upgrade . quicken easy learn , easy use , maybe not so easy import export data it very propriatary but still all i love it online portfolio views data glance .	1
before i write my review , i would like note i one semester mandarin chinese , so i am familiar some most basic words phrases . i am using rosetta stone addition my chinese classes so i learn speak better able listen chinese regular basis outside class . i read user guide before -- while -- using rosetta stone . program not 100% user-friendly , so i needed user guide find out how get started program , how put program test mode , how view my test scores , etc . it very easy after you read user guide play around program little while figure everything out . you select " preview " see hear what you learning , " guided exercise " taken through lesson automatically , or go through numbered exercises one one . most exercises , you hear description and/or see photograph , you match up description and/or photo one four answer choices . depending exercise you , you recognize characters , spoken words , or both . there three options reading writing text : pinyin , simplified , traditional characters . these lower right screen . i am using traditional characters my classes , so i always select traditional characters option . there seems lot confusion among reviewers writing section . my cd , there four different types exercises you writing : two exercises allow pinyin only other two allow pinyin , simplified , or traditional characters . traditional simplified characters entered into text box using drag-and-drop method . if you use pinyin writing , you make rather awkward tone mark selections get them over right letter or your answer wrong . although some people would claim pinyin easier than characters , rosetta stone it infinitely easier memorize characters due constant repetition phrases than it remember where tone marks go pinyin . curriculum text so far no use me all , appears pinyin simplified characters only ( which no good someone trying learn traditional characters ) . you don't even really need it proceed lessons , anyway . speaking portion not working out entirely well me , personally . you need usb headset record your voice order compare it native speaker . i speak unnaturally-loud level record anything all , i speak constant force my voice or program stops recording me . i never get my reply match intensity speaker , even microphone directly front my mouth me speaking very loudly into it ( just below shouting level ) . this could my problem , though . although i don't ever match speaker voice , it good practice able hear comparisons my pronunciation speaker . i haven't needed use customer support anything so i can't comment installation easy . i would describe my first semester chinese intensely challenging probably hardest class i ever taken my life . like i said beginning , i am using rosetta stone help me build what i learned already , it great so far respect	1

good news : bitdefender found dormant worm deleted email our pcs norton internet security ( nis ) 2007 missed . also , bd very little impact our systems or applications speed , which why we uninstalled nis - we 8 months left norton 3-pc license but our two older pcs ( 4 5 yrs old ) slowed down due nis so much they practically unusable . hourly bd updates almost unnoticable . bad news : when we installed bd 2nd pc ( 2-pcs 2-yrs license ) , we made mistake using my spouse email passwd instead mine , which we used 1st pc . bad move . it trouble starting , modules erratically turning off . we logged into bitdefender site found same exact license registered two different accounts . we uninstalled it , reinstalled it using my email passwd 2nd key , showed up my account ok . however , there no way delete my spouse account or key their website . her copy still ran funky , but least it started . we used online chat support they friendly asked we download two tools their website provide them sysinfo dumps email . we dumps sent them reply their follow-up email bd trouble ticket # subject . no reply after 3 days . we sent two other queries , one ticket # one without , both explaining we needed her bad account key deleted , there probably some server license issues going hindering operation her pc . again , no response . we wound up uninstalling her 2nd copy my package , buying 2nd 2-pc 2-yrs package . least those packages via amazon $15 cheaper than 1-pc 1-yr cd version directly softwin ( bitdefender ) , so even dual cd purchase it working out only $16 per yr per pc ( nis $35/yr/pc ) . since we installed her 2nd package using different email passwd , alias her name , there doesn't seem any key conflicts causing her bitdefender run whacky . sorry long-winded comments , but we wanted you know if everything goes great , product fast , low-resource impact , finds stuff norton misses . but ( big but ) , if you got problem , you're your own , pal ! tech support zip , nada , zed , zero . thankyouverymuch	1
nero 7 ultra edition extremely comprehensive suite software . unfortunately , most applications contained within more than most people ( including myself ) ever need . perhaps , this suite should broken into three or four different products sold seperately . example , they could easily sell dvd authoring product , cd authoring product , back-up ultility music/mp3 software . pros : when you figure out how work individual components this suite ( see cons ) , they work well seamlessly . i like its ability combine vob files into one file then export it into variety different formats using nero vision . nero recode works well if you burned home movies onto dvd+r dl disc need switch it onto single-layer disc family members who not dl technology . utility burning data cds or dvds ( classic nero burning rom)is quick painless . i don't use other applications much , but you careful nero doesn't make itself default player all types media . cons : website poor instructions difficult follow if you find them . faq section out date doesn't address major questions i when trying figure this software out ( possible it language issue ) . there not even user forums discuss problems software like many other companies offer . software update utility not work me i unable use it months therefore unable fix bug occasionally lead fatal windows xp error . if you update newest version ( instructions follow ) , things work better . i never any compatability problems my drives i seen lot people complain . fixes : if you unable update software usning update utility , following worked me : 1 ) download latest upgrade [ ... ] 2 ) using control panel ( add remove programs ) , remove nero your computer . 3 ) install new upgrade your hard drive . installation program detect your valid software serial number install new version nero 7 ultra . careful nero doesn't make itself default player all media files during installation . 4 ) new update utility works 1000x better than old one there should not any problems . new version nero 7 ultra far superior original version well . course , instruction web site not tell you you uninstall old version before installing new version . it took long time lot frustration figure it out . overall : 1 ) software worked very well me . it worked faster than other applications i tried . 2 ) web site bad , best . documentation bad , best . update utility included this suite non-functional , but upgrade works very well . 3 ) i give this high marks software performance , but subtract simply too many applications included horrible customer support bad web site . 4 ) since i value functionality over customer support , i give this 4 stars ( i would give 3.5 , but not option )	1
i bought this 6 months ago when i bought my first mac also my first computer . i don't know why they aren't selling more these things . me , looking manual size phonebook interesting stocking shelves supermarke t.t his dvd rom 8 hours long covers all items contents very well . perhaps manual you get into more detail but me this place start least . what i watch section then either take few notes go particular program or just go particular program itself . way i own couple manuals appleworks but they just collect dust	1

i know most people simply not backup their systems . if they only knew how easy it product like norton ghost . this product not only backs up your files , it actually takes snapshot your system . if your hard drive fails completely , you boot off cd clone new drive state it when last backup ( actually called recovery point ) . trust me , it works . i hard drive fail me . great feature you also easily restore individual files specific recovery point . previously used norton ghost 9.0 backup , i already big fan . but , version 10.0 well worth upgrade . improvements include norton ghost manage space used backups , so you don't guess how many recovery points fit your backup drive . biggest improvement all - you mount recovery point mapped drive copy files previous backups , just like it any other mapped drive . i not used backup cr-rw or dvd-rw , although product supports it . i would highly recommend getting extra internal hard drive or external usb hard drive dedicated backup norton ghost . i use this method it works great	1

after trying several game engines , " affordable " class , darkbasicpro only one without high end limitations . reviewer said , it wrapper directx . this means you all capabilities directx , without complexities , including shaders , sound , media , collision detection , packaging , etc . it gives good frame rate ! package matured within last year , many earlier defects corrected . ( manual still leaves room improvement . buy dark basic book also , you happier ! )dark basic pro now requires directx 9.0 . really fast action games , you need reasonably powerful pc . if you find any command limitations , ( even though it over thousand commands ) , you always write your own dll , add capabilities , such octrees engine ( which they don't yet . ) there now several third party add-ons , such " treemagik g2 " other enhancement packs which greatly aid game construction . check out game creators web site , forums ! there other game engines which simpler , " spoon feed " process you . but once you get little experience , you frustrated limitations caused watered down interface . dark basic pro not much more difficult use , tremendously more powerful flexible .	1

i found taxcut work very well easy follow . it hard bet it under 9 bucks ! i didn't buy state version because michigan state tax form pretty much no brainer fill out since you get very few deductions once you your agi all you calculate tax due . i mainly needed tax program would figure out if any amt due . irs paperwork amt confusing me i wanted program would work me . i saw some other posts people problems installing taxcut it lock up 21% . taxcut website they talk not certain font package your computer cause lock up . therefore , i downloaded installed font package first . then i installed taxcut away i went . i ran update manager first which took some time my painfully slow 28.8 connection , but got through it half hour . only reason i not give it 5 stars there too many commercials hr block services donations portion weak because it limited amount donation spaces log your donations . therefore , i group donation which little bit pain because it thought donations needed special form because it exceeded some limits . some reason it wanted know if they donations post 9/27 . this became slight problem grouping donations . positive side i like way it logged any capital gains stocks or mutual funds . all said i able my taxes sunday afternoon rather than over entire week .	1
any e-dictionary give you definitions course , but what i especially like this one it lightning fast . also , when definition contains illustration it indicated icon which you double click view ( which comes up instanteously seperate window ) . this dictionary also allows you search word different criteria other than just its definitions : rhymes , homophones , date , author quoted , definition contains ... etc , etc . one note installation : make sure you temporarily disable active virus software ( it wouldn't hurt same those other programs right side task bar )	1
