these great blades , installation very straight forward . only gripe i these blades contact blade windshield extreme right where it ceases touch my windshield which 1/2 " , but odd thing tip touch my windshield up stroke . but it so minor it would not affect rating all since these blades fit onto so many different cars . i guess there no replacement factory blades	1

though i still encounter products not worth time laugh , i noticed more more products coming market actually meet sometimes beat expectations . well , mr. clean autodry met expectations , though it couple flaws . i've owned this product since it first hit store shelves , after very hyped up television marketing deal ... i figured if i bought it target it not work my satisfaction , target give me my money back . i tried it , it worked perfectlly . i knew prior experience de-ionised water not leave spots it ions molecules water left behind when water molecules evaporate . remove those ions there nothing left behind . i little sceptical such small filter would work well , however , but most part , it worked acceptably , but unit some flaws , i should list them ... flaw 1 ) soap filler cap badly designed . if there any soap left unit when you store it , you sure store it so cap upright ( it units side , not top ) , else you find puddle congealed , semi-dry soap when you pull it off shelf week later ! there no work around this except remember store unit upright , or lay other side . flaw 2 ) lack trigger flow control . unit uses very peculiar flip switch which little difficult flip off easily . it not terrible , but trigger like garden sprayer would so much better ! flaw 3 ) hose connector not turn freely ... you walk around car , hose twists water pressure tries twist it back ... this might limited unit i purchased , but either way , it quite annoying . i found perfect work around this , though it cost me few extra dollars . i bought hose quick disconnect spins quite freely . it little expensive ($6 , but works better than any other i ever tried , i simple screwed one end onto autodry other onto hose , got some extra sprayer connectors ($4 each ) other spray heads i use , it all good . other than above three flaws , i am quite pleased this product , use it routinely . i wash my car 30 minutes , i am quite particular ... here procedure i follow : 1 ) i quickly rinse down whole car get any dirt wet . 2 ) i then spray section car , usually starting roof , soap3 ) using super soft , laundered wool wash mitt , i gently " scrub " soaped area , quickly rinse unfiltered water , ensure entire car remains wet . 4 ) repeat steps 2 3 other parts car ( i.e. hood , trunk , sides , etc . ) , 5 ) using filtered water , starting high points car ( i.e. roof ) working down sills , i completely rinse off whole car then let it dry , sun or shade . i've never any spots whatsoever , except when filter turns brown ( which indicates filter exhausted )	1

i installed this item my 2001 dodge truck shortly after i purchased my truck nov . 2000 . i not any problems unit all . my key fob worn out , though it seen some abuse . i installed unit myself using their instructions . install take longer than i anticipated , but mostly because it sometimes took bit find correct wire truck . all , it great features fair price	1
this unit exactly what it says . reads codes allows you reset check engine light . it also software intrepret codes , but this very basic nature you find same info internet or some car mnufacturers . unit very well built easy operate .	1
there more expensive units out there they might appropriate you if you need more information . but this one perfect what i need . i " check engine " lights both my 2000 accord 2005 camry . i wanted find out what problems so i could decide if it something needed immediate attention find out if it something i could fix myself . it found problems both cars within couple minutes reset errors . honda " proprietary " error so i installed database software ( extremely easy install ) looked it up ( extremely easy use ) . turns out both cars non-critical problems i could just reset errors . this would cost me $150 my car maintenance shop . this device also functions pollution control system diagnostic tool . i haven't tried yet but it interesting see how works . i would highly recommend this " casual " user . pros would probably need something more stuff , but this extremely useful shade-tree mechanics	1

i'm little surprised bad reviews . i used mine years though i wear one out after 80 uses airing up four large truck tires 12 psi 35 psi through 150psi , 2.5 gal tank . i it hard-mounted my jeep . it pressurizes air tank which connected chucks both ends jeep . i start compressor near end trail time we stop air tank full pressure . then i connect hose one air chucks start airing up tires . compressor runs into tank tank feeds hose . i usually air one tire up 30 seconds this way . compressor doesn't catch up this makes it much easier work - everything up out way all i manage hose . tires i stop talk let compressor fill tank again . or i air up next tire . this unit not last forever not like handled roughly . i only handled plug once - plug it when i bolted it jeep permanently . so i don't plug problems . it noisy but it sound you want hear when you need air . i remember one night helping friend who flat . they very grateful hear sound see their tire come back life . if you want industrial strength unit , you going spend several hundred dollars . this unit keeps up well arb compressor costs four times much . treat it well it treat you well	1
this unit works surprisingly well following caveats : 1 . you must replace cheap cig lighter plug aligator style clips designed hooked directly your battery . cheap connector becomes hot point melting . this due high current demand placed battery . your mechanic or local car electroncs store should able this you . also , it take approx 5 min inflate your tire . it bit slow . 2 . you should run your car engine so battery doesnt run down . product built fan seems keep unit cooler while running . i liked it what it	1

i probably went through 5 different " suction cup " mounted compasses none them worked properly . there too many magnetic fields vehicle them work properly without calibration . this compass however worked great within 5 minutes . installation easy enough , once it mounted all you need hold button down 5 seconds put compass " calibration " mode , then drive around circles slowly until it stops flashing . granted , you look like idiot driving circle parking lot somewhere , but once you compass works just like one you would find factory installed . only complaints actual sensor feels kinda cheap it came apart slightly when i mounting it . it just snapped back together though . also , back light just stays 3 seconds . i'd rather it stay 10 , but you need think how long it really takes you read two letters ? if you actually want compass your car it didn't come one , this only one i've found actually works . so just buy it . :	1
this multimeter all around good tool . it all features you need plus some features only more expensive ones . like battery tester backlight display . i am studying electronics right now i find myself getting ton more use out it than i thought i would . it easy use instruction manual comes it tells you how perform most common tests it pictures go . there comperable multi-meters out there cost less but most would cost more . there certainly better multi-meters than this one but they cost more . only bad things i say this tool battery hard get . you remove 2 screws back pry it apart . actron should just put one those slide off battery covers it . also most multi-meters come some sort rubber , protective sleeve , also lanyard your hand so you dont drop it . if this mult-meter lanyard battery easier get out , i would given it 5 stars .	1

after reading numerous raving reviews here amazon.com several other sites , learning auto clay safe clear coat paints because it works through non-abrasive process , i decided give it try -- boy , i glad i ! my car covered stubborn deposit dirt grime simply would not come off car wash . it seemed dirt grime gotten lodged paint wouldn't budge no matter how hard i tried washing car . after every car wash , i would run my fingers through paint it would still feel gritty . when i learned mothers 07240 california gold clay bar paint saving system kit . results astounding ! after using it , paint no longer felt gritty but glassy-smooth . paint no longer dulled contaminants car looked like it new coat paint ! i immensely pleased results . unlike lot car polish or polishing compounds use abrasion strip away surface contaminants , auto clay simply picks up surface contaminants locks them into clay . clay looks feels exactly like plasticine ( play-doh�) it used included " lubricant " spray ( actually , auto soap provide lots suds -- like meguiar gold class -- work equally well . ) mind you , car polish still its place paint restoration because claying not remove scratches ; only car polish or polishing compound ( harsher ) . remember , always follow claying application wax shield your paint new contaminants . also , clay your car every so often you keep paint looking like new ! i am giving mothers 07240 california gold clay bar paint saving system kit my highest recommendation . go , try it see yourself firsthand difference it makes your car paint . it worth every penny i'm sure you'll glad you !	1

it appears problem slow readings described earlier reviews solved , my gauge reads continuously . reading drops several psi while bleeding just mechanical dial gauge . reading takes two seconds re-stabilize , so mechanical gauge actually faster use . quick-connector end hose excellent , but careful not scratch wheel it . hose fairly stiff , but isn't problem most time . i used this gauge track this past weekend , pleased it until second morning when it cold ( cold i mean 45f , this houston ... ) display read ' lo ' , indicating low battery . so essentially gauge useless . hose also becomes annoyingly stiff when cold . overall , good mechanical gauge easier use more reliable , long you don't drop it	-1

i so excited this bag but it huge disappointment . description clearly indicates waterproof , but fact it mostly water resistant , 8 scale 1-10 according box . since our travel coincided several rain storms , this very important differentiation ! straps ' net ' extremely unmanageable there several key elements missing instructions . never used roof top cargo bag before , this presented quite obstacle me . there loops through which you send straps net holds bag down , instructions make no mention them , you loop strap through before or after you loop it through luggage rack ? it make difference ? it took me 45 minutes just get thing attached my roof due trial error ( not counting loading time ) . clips themselves very poor construction , one them broke upon tightening makeshift tied instead . straps also not tighten very easily , you feed straps through clips then keep moving clips back forth until you get it length you wan t.t he stitching also started ripping when trying close very stubborn zipper . bag not overstuffed . i cannot recommend this product	-1
" advanced security " all lie . these locks easily opened without key . i written masterlock company they replaced lock free charge one uses regular key	-1

appears good product one major exception . you can't even charge it first use without getting extension cord plug into 110v power . required cord must only one plug where most cords today come plug end let you plug more than one item . blades jump starter resessed so extension cord must only one place plug anything or fitting big go into recess . got this present so far report old type cord hard find . i find it unbelievable any company producing this item would not include 4 feet cheap cord so product could put service once	-1
description this product not accurate . these lights not bright . i 6 mounted under cabinets my very small kitchen all 6 once add up equivalent night light . it pretty color light , but very dim	-1
i unsure this company so i only popped week subscription , felt gamble $10 worth it . well not all gambles work out , this one not . when you 1st register you tell them what vehicle you , now one might think once you this information you want access your particular vehicle , not so . i want know how replace certain part , well you go part look it up , it tells you replacement procedure car not even yours , nothing your car , uh !! c'mon . there very little trobleshooting , no flow charts troubleshooting . save you money buy haynes manual your vehicle , you'll much farther ahead .	-1
we purchased this rooftop cargo carrier transport our suitcases beach items during our summer vacation new england . we initially concerned because it so inexpensive size worried it might not fit trailblazer . upon arrival we pleased find it not only fit securely , but rather stylish too . although it appeared weatherproof we soon found it not . it began raining onset our trip . four hours our fourteen hour roadtrip weatherproof lining began disintingrating . time we arrived our destination all our possessions soaked coated tiny grey vinyl flecks . this cargo hauler might cheap look nice , but it not worth your money	-1

i hooked up small 20 watt solar system my home . bought this sunforce 60012 7 amp charge controller everything worked great . led came controller sent power battery even low cloudy days no sun . i saw some hype online morningstar ' sunguard sg-4 ' ( it pwm ) it fancy line graph showing how it far superior other controllers . bought one $27 . oo $11 . oo shipping tacked vendor ) , swapped it out this sunforce 60012 controller hoping big improvement . waited morning ... put my volt meter system only find sunguard sg-4 ( no led ) still sound asleep ! zero volts passing through it ! so i immediately removed sunguard sg-4 re-installed sunforce 60012 charge controller i purchased here amazon . poof ... back producing 12 volts my solar panels hazy sky no sign sun . sunguard sg-4 now it way local landfill ... sunforce 60012 permanent home my home solar power system . sunforce led glowing solar 12 volts flowing my battery again . stick sunforce 60012 it far superior works like it supposed . call me old-fashioned ... i think that why i bought sunforce ( ' sunguard sg-4 ' ~ 4 amp w/ no led ) first place ? # sunforce 60012 7 amp charge controller # : low price high quality it actually what it supposed !

i bit skeptical buying this product because other products i tried claimed spot-free failed miserably . i pleasantly surprised mr. clean autodry system ! if you follow directions put bit effort into your wash job it works very , very good ! - you first rinse off your vehicle regular , unfiltered water either through autodry gun or your regular hose sprayer . - next , you use autodry " soap " setting completely cover vehicle . they advise only use mr. clean soap , course , because it contains agents not normally found other car washing soap assists sheeting action ( similar jet dry dishwasher)- thirdly , you give vehicle old fashioned hand wash sponge . make sure you good job clean it completely or you find streaks when it dries old dirty water smeared all over . - fourth , rinse vehicle completely unfiltered water . make sure you very through this stage . take your time ! - finally , set autodry filtered rinse setting go over vehicle again . make sure you start vehicle highest point remove all tap water sitting roof . basically , you want filtered water remove all unfiltered water . spray filtered water all crevices avoid spots later ( side view mirrors , bumpers , etc . ) although it sounds like it takes long time it really quite quick if you put some effort into it . i complete vehicle ( ford explorer ) start finish 15 minutes . car dries completely spot free every time ! course , results only good you make them . if you don't wash completely or rinse unfiltered water off completely there spots . it up you through job get great results	1

i've never used any other type oil filter wrench or strap but this tool worked me when i couldn't twist off oil filter hand . it uses 3/8 " drive but it doesn't " snap " onto wrench so it fall off easily . long you careful , you shouldn't problem it save you lot time when changing your oil filter . prongs adjusted holding onto " base " turning socket wrench . prongs rotate around base depending direction you turn . way it works widest position , turning either direction cause prongs " close " certain direction . way , long you prongs closing proper direction , when you trying remove oil filter , it grip harder you turn counter-clockwise . if you prongs closing wrong direction , then turning counter-clockwise actually widen prongs	1

perhaps black decker got lot complaints earlier edition this item -- but i should note first one i received today nice , heavy metal clamps . haven't used it yet but i'm confident it work well . i'm very impressed apparent high quality construction fit finish , well design . frankly , i think it would good value $49.99 amazon lists retail price -- but course amazon price free shipping much better	1
. dorau -- when properly stored , what you complain never happen . battery should -never- stored sub-zero or near-freezing temperatures . don't leave it garage ! this unit offers " quick " recharging ( 4 5 hours ) 12v source or gradual recharging ( 12 24 hours ) ac source . ac source may left connected indefinitely ( true " float " charging ) which plus standby power source . inclusion led light source very thoughtful part designer(s ) . addition jump starting car , this good choice small household items ( tv , radio , weather alert radio ) or emergency communications equipment ( cb , ham radio ) . this product also appears some stores under " husky " " vector " brand-names	1
jan . 21 update : i got low-battery indication while using gauge , it turns out lr1130 batteries alkaline , not lithium both product packaging instructions say they . batteries indeed very easily replaced , i'm replacing them silver oxide equivalent ( sr1130w ) , original batteries apparently weren't freshest ( although they hitachi-maxell ) . i continue like this gauge very much . i think this great product great price ( currently $35 total ) , i just bought 2nd one lend so others see themselves ( don't want without mine case it doesn't come back ) . very simple connect take reading , when bleeding air numbers drop drop air pressure , so i reach exact pressure i want quickly . batteries user replaceable , but they lithium ( lr1130 ) expected last more than several years ( packaging suggests they last life gauge , " permanent power " ) . gauge zeroed ( recalibrated ) simply turning it without any air pressure hose , confirming display reads " 0.0 , " waiting until display goes off ( 20 sec . when no pressure present 60 sec . when there pressure present ) . while gauge display reads tenth pound , actual stated accuracy instructions plus or minus 1 percent plus 0.5 psi , which suggests real accuracy within 0.2 0.8 pound , which still better than any other gauge i've seen or used . instructions explain things well enough ( they read though they translated into english , but still completely understandable ) , listed web site actual manufacturer , measurement ltd ., inc . ( new jersey ) , provides contact info . user inquiries . i like using this gauge ( it quick easy ) , makes maintaining my tire pressure proper level simple consistently ( good portable air compressor , like typhoonmax tx-500 , which i also really like ) .	1

i used one these water-blades school car wash sold . parent brought water-blade said he received it gift really happy it , used it lot . it not remove all water , you still some small amounts require towel , but this small amount . we used it 20-30 cars car wash pre-dry cars before kids finished job it worked great ! purchased one myself , so i guess that good recommendation	1

i am car fanatic used one these dusters my cars last decade or more . long surface dry , it works wonderfully . once some contaminants start build paint , use duster , then some quick detail microfiber cloth get paint really clean . my cars always look new these things . i just traded my 2004 rx-8 after 2.5 years using duster , it still looked absolutely new . i now use it my 2006 lancer evolution , again , car looks brand-new ( which it ) . i love them	1
i first got one these gift back late ' 80s when i bought my first new car . it worked exactly advertised intervening years , i replaced it only two or three times ... it actually work better once it gets dirtier - i absolutely attest this i got new one year ago , older one worked better first ... after couple weeks ( i dust car four times day ) , it started work well older one . i took old one tried washing it hand cold ater woolite , recommended makers website , it definitely cleaner still worked just well . if you love your car even half much i , this product worth every cent	1
it simple device , it easy imagine enhancements would improve it , yet it advertised just what i wanted it . it sits shallow cardboard box seats my old nissan where it perfectly level not shift around while i'm driving , so i set it up just before i leave work . i work close my home , so my morning commute ten minutes , time it takes wagan brew my coffee . larger cup brew-through lid would make it safer use while car motion , which manufacturer recommends against , still i am very happy it no complaints .	1

my mv-50 just arrived tonight it worked fine , it would made sense if it cigarette adaptor than use battery . gauge starts off zero increments 5psi , so it off 5psi ! gauge reads : 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 . 20psi , it showing 25psi . only confusion what i found internet some people paying only $25 this not $70 plus shipping charges . connector not useful tight spaces , like rear motorcycle tire my yamaha 650 maxim . i think it going perform my racing needs .	1
its great product it coats when it rains when you just put it you dont even need use wipers but it take some work make sure its not smeared looking . clean your glass good windex first then apply polish off . i dont really buy any those seen tv items but this first one really works well also if you side windows squeak this help well since slippery it help weather stripping . remember this works best when over 40mph ... you keep reapplying few times yea	1

pros : inexpensive , compact thoughtfully designed . cons : no dc adapter , although there hole ad-on connector . no power cord you need extension cord fit recessed a/c port . recommend : yes ! paid : $19.00 summer closeoutcomments : i bought this jump start my 1 ton dodge rv after winter storage . i've jumpped my 1997 gmc suburban various other cars/trucks it performed flawlessly i live area where sub-zero temps norm during fall winter . it not flashlight , warning light , battery charger , air compressor or dc converter ! but it decent jump starter affordable price !	1

i bought this tire gauge specifically check tire pressure my f350 dually . factory installed steel extenders made using pencil type gauges or other digital gauges impractical , particularly checking inner outer rear tires . even though this gauge sold ' dual rear wheel trucks ' , i bend steel tube 5 degrees so it could make solid contact inner tire inflation stem . once it bent , gauge worked perfectly ! note : i friends machine shop bend steel tube me , it too stiff bend hand or vice . gauge big digits easy read , even without my cheater glasses . air release button handle convienent use - even though i first thought it display . i found it best test pressure , add more air than needed then slowly release it using combination button disengaging reengaging gauge testing until you get desired tire pressure . i found if i failed disengage then reengage tire pressure gauge , it tended give me same reading without resetting . guys garages always ' ohhhh ahhhh ' when i open case pull out this impressive tool . it well worth money amazon best price various sites i visited while price shopping . oh , yea , i cut plastic case tad allow bent tube properly fit case so it would close	1
goes easy , wipes off super , amazinglyl easy , gives very nice finish . i'll wait few months see how long it lasts , but application pleasant experience . one thing - they said it doesn't get black trim white , but it looks like it - white starting show 2 weeks after i applied it . it possible it my previous wax , but i don't think so since i covered mother back-to-black product .	1

i read evacuators few forums - it works described . no complaints other than amount time it took draw 8 quarts . said , perhaps first use included bit learning curve . fill/drain capability looked appealing , but if you don't need use this device fill fluids , i would opt drain-only device - less moving parts , fewer things fail	1
works well . it operates bit slowly but i assume they all . this not problem would not prevent me purchasing it again . significant advantage this unit fluid evacuated unit w/o " pour " it out . others require opening resevoir pouring fluid out . this useful when dealing w/ motor oil or other fluids messy . i am satisfied would purchase it again .	1

only minor drawback long time it takes fill tires air pump . otherwise i'm very pleased this product .	1
most people agree u-locks one best ways locking up your bicycle . i agree assessment , provided there something strong which affix lock . whatever you lock your bike , it right height right shape order accessible u-lock . i seen many bicyclists dc area use their $100 u-lock secure their $3000 bicycle things like street signs , wrought-iron fences , rusty pipes , even wooden park benches . street sign poles , which usually line holes running down them , designed give break away when hit automobiles . thief could easily bend break street sign pole get your bike . i recently heard friend their bike stolen because thief merely pulled loose pole its decaying cement base . coworker bike stolen when thief lifted bike off top pole after removing bolted-on street sign . wrought iron fences easily broken kicked or leveraged welding points . rusty pipes , well , need i say more ? point , bike racks aren't always where you need them , you can't always find something right size use your u-lock . two job sites i ride my work , only things i lock my bicycle gigantic street light poles . new york chain only truly secure way lock up my beloved bicycle . versatility chain best part this locking system . when i use bike racks , i just either wrap chain few times around bike or racks , or i fix lock links closer together chain - easily accomplished if you pull black sleeve back . now only complaint i new york chain : it heavy . really heavy . first ride i took new york chain , i just threw it my messenger bag strapped bag diagonally across my chest . weight so lopsided i felt myself leaning away bag just improve my balance while riding . first time ever , i used twin shoulder straps until then tucked into their pocket messenger bag . even then , weight enough leave red chafe marks my shoulders evening after my ride home . maybe younger riders handle weight , but i'm little further age it bit much . if your waist skinny enough , you wear it your waist like belt . i tried it way if you put lock back or your non-dominant side it isn't all bad . but my bicycle touring experience tells me this one those items you should really carry bike if all possible . i don't recommend handlebars - makes steering sluggish . top tube okay , but lock nasty habit swinging into your knees you pedal . eventually i start carrying laptop computer around work , so i got luggage rack panniers . throwing chain panniers definitely easiest option . when you're not carrying anything else panniers , trunk bag even better place it - weight higher bike , yes , but it centered . overall , i like this lock its versatility locking options , allowing me lock my bicycle anything large immovable . i think this best way get highest level kryptonite security . however , if bike racks more abundant my area , i would gladly give up extra weight getting standard u-lock	1

we needed way haul three adult-sized bicycles our home base various cycling paths . so i visited number local stores see what my options . i settled yakima bighorn 4 best option my budget , then discovered through some online searching i could purchase next model up , yakima kingpin 4 bike rack bit less than bighorn 4 would run me traditional retailer . kingpin 4 folds features fold-down mast , must convenience allow access vehicle rear hatch or door . although i would not consider bike rack without this feature , forewarned : once you lower rack while it loaded three bikes ( more fourth bike claim follows ) , you hard pressed single-handedly reposition it slide lock or bolt . there too much weight pivot point . i soon learned , therefore , it easier mast folded up , not down , when loading bikes . dual bike arms must , allowing more stability easier loading unloading . bike arms fold down well , though this option , while useful , not essential many cases . ( these folding bike arms main difference kingpin bighorn racks . ) series bike cradles rubber " chainstraps " stabilize anchor bikes . you slide theses cradles tubular arms allow sufficient room avoid any rubbing or scraping if you carrying three bikes . ( i looked some less expensive racks required hand-tightening one or more big bolts tighten clamps held bikes . system seemed like royal pain huge annoyance . ) despite name billing , i'm less confident recommending kingpin4 transporting four bikes . i think it possible , but would require great care avoid scraping paint or entangling pedals spokes . plus , i prefer using four " chainstraps " per bike bit insurance , so if you want carry four bikes , i would recommend springing set these . unloaded contraption weights 32 pounds , so it not too heavy you carry it basement or garage install it . but careful arms or you might shatter glass door or outside light . also , you need bit assembly out box , so allow good 30 minutes set up test rig before using it first time . drawings instructions not seem match what i actually looking when i everything before me floor , so i spent extra few minutes considering options . this assembly not difficult---it just adage " never anything first time " may stump one bit . i am using this rack two-inch hitch , i purchased locking pin replace bolt shipped attaching rack hitch . i also run one cable bike locks through bike frames around spanner arms add measure security . during our first foray , 100-mile trip each way , bikes rack swayed just bit time time , but overall , sway not problem . hundred extra pounds jutting up behind rear window change any vehicle handling hamper visibility through rearview mirror , so prepared change your driving style needed . conclude , kingpin 4 performed well . we could load unload three bikes five minutes , neither durango or bikes scratched during transport . but , again , i would suggest this rack great three bikes , but may challenge carrying four .	1
i love my tink visor . it matches my tink seat covers floor mats . i wish it held more cd though , but it holds typical amount visor ( 10 cd ) . i'm very happy this purchase	1

ok , this item . looking easy in-expensive parking system : this it . well , i own ferrari ' two ' car garage . nothing comes 3 ' my-precious ..... but , parking this beauty what now become space shuttle simulation area , requires precise skills , course which i ... goes without saying . looked in-floor bumpa systems but required sticky tape cleaning it wasn't good . desired electronic stuff but hated thought electricity such cost some too high justify : enter this item which pure spot-on . it uses power , get this , your garage door light . there light activated switch triggers laser fire blinking fashion . very compact , very easy install , very small [ laser 1.5 " long . solar powering laser works like charm , trigger works perfectly no power sources worry . if it doesn't work it means you didn't open door [ separate problem ] or garage light out [ separate problem ] . this device hot after several months , still attached , works like charm : get this one	1
using mr clean autodry system while now . long filter refill not used up ( stops deionizing water ) , you'll get nice sheeting effect when you rinse vehicle off , allowing it dry spot-free . thing you remember this isn't pressure washer , or anything other than system . you wet vehicle , wash system soap , then rinse normal water . when you're ready dry , use filtered water , then let dry ! best if you wash your vehicle shaded area , or soap/rinse water dry leaving spots . only negative i it it doesn't last very long when you've got full-size truck minivan needs washing . after 2-3 washes my vehicles ( total , not each ! ) filter doesn't deionize well . but sure make drying much easier these big vehicles ! no more hand drying me	1

i finally upgrade my old faithful 35-year-old schumacher 6 amp charger - not because it quit working , but because it didn't enough horsepower handle big 105 ampere-hour trolling motor battery my boat . i wanted higher capacity unit , but same solidly built reliability i've experienced my old shumacher charger . this unit priced quite bit less than some other brands similar capability , so i little afraid schumacher , like many companies , might gone " cheap " route their products using lightweight case cheap components . not so ! i pleasantly surprised find this solid , heavy , well built charger best schumacher tradition . well designed very stout plastic cabinet pop-up carrying handle , informative easy use front panel controls , nice features like automatic no-spark battery connecting/disconnecting even if you forget unplug it first , plus automatic polarity protection , looong power cord handy place store cord . i found only single minor negative : if i change anything this unit , i'd find quieter fan . fan , although it pretty loud it size , least automatic only runs when needed , so this no big deal me , since i only run it my shop/garage . haven't tried " start " function , which i consider more or less useless frill charger this size , but it certainly charges all types batteries like champ , automatic quick charge/maintenance charge function works great . i highly recommend this great little charger	1
this unit everything i expected it it not overly expensive , considering features	1

if you want deep gloss , smooth finish , paint protection , then you love nxt . but advised , nxt paste , better product than liquid . they both give same look , but paste seems last longer , because liquid more solvants them . paste not hard use all , secret ues very small amount . if you try caking it , you hard time getting it off , you end up streaks . i silver frost lincoln town car , nxt brings out metal flake paint . car looks good it when it new , it currently three years old . cost littie high side , but don't forget , if you want best look , protection , it wil cost you little more . if you just want wax , get bottle less expencive product ans call it day . if you want best look your , then use nxt . you love results	1

all i say wow ... just ... wow . i wanted some good replacement windshield wiper blades bosch blades i ( they year half old weren't holding out well ) . i my research decided look into silicon rubber blades after reading so much them . i first going get piaa brand , however price five year warranty silblades offered changed my mind . i haven't looked back since . one things i hated my old blades they ended up making lot noise when sliding against windshield unless there decent amount water pouring down . first day i installed these onto my car first rain drizzle came down i sold . blades whisper quiet , even just little moisture glass . you literally won't hear them . heck , they quiet even if you no water glass . all you hear motors turn blades . my old bosche blades weren't anywhere near quiet , even right out box . silblades seem work really well getting water off windshield too . i dare say better than any other blades i used . some other blades i would sometimes leave thin trail water still glass , but not silblades . everything wipes clean blade path . also it true what they say silicone rubber leaving protective coating . rain your windshield start bead just like after waxing your car . i can't say it happened immediately because ... well my windshield waxed day before i installed blades . however beading lasting much , much longer than it should waxing alone . i live houston , tx so i'm love how these blades hold up against searing heat . no cracks yet or even color fading . i can't tell you how well they snow ice since we don't get much either here , i haven't travelled anywhere test blades yet . however i don't doubt manufacturer claims standing up bitter cold . piaa silicone blades claimed they could all these things too . however they $25 per blade only guaranteed work year . silblades five year warranty price can't beat . if you really , really want noticeable difference our windshield wiping experience then i suggest you grab these your own vehicle . you thank me it .	1
this first clay bar system i used , it still best . you absolutely need use this before you wax , or else you're just waxing those impurities into your finish , creating more annoying swirl marks . doing this step before you wax bit more work , but it worth it . i could live without mother wax they include kit , i don't use it . but i always use this before i wax my car . glass-like feeling your paint gets amazing	1

i bought this product whim . i looking carwash detergent safeway , mr. clean autodry sale . curious , i gave it try . first all , this unit wastes lot water . after washing rinsing , you apply filtered water all over car distance one feet . it feels like spray painting . then you wait water evaporate . problem , i live san franisco , ca -- nothing dries this climate without help . if i hadn't hand dried my car , i'd still waiting water evaporate . odd thing -- hand drying actually seemed more difficult after using mr. clean soap unit . it though it left residue . i'm not sure what it . but i'll probably end up washing my car again tomorrow , old-fashioned way ..	-1

we bought this scratch remover years ago auto store . it wasn't expensive but totally useless . we put it scratch or two our car which black what it said . it nothing except leave white stain area i applied it . i tried everything get it off , then i use my last option rubbing compound . luckily rubbing compound got stain off . after this i dumped tube our basement lost track it since then ( probably dumped it ) . shortly after we went auto store again we found auto paint . they come little tube paint brush each paint code ( got get one your model car ) . used it worked well years later still looks good . up close you still see scratch there but only really up close . after i waxed area after paint dried it looked fine . unless you look it you not see scratch . so don't buy this product either buy auto paint or take your car auto body shop . this product would better door stop even then it would probably poor job .	-1

you trust this item works well not scratch your paint . i always skeptical previously just asssumed these things scratched car . but my paintless dent removal guy uses one highly recommended california duster me . he fanatical keeping his car totally detailed . this product works so well he never even washes his car unless it gets rained . he just dusts it every morning before he backs out his garage , if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it . it takes total less than 2 minutes dust off entire car , yet result makes your car look like you just washed it . i use california duster before putting my car cover so there no dust car car cover . if you garage , it quite useful since dust settles car during day when you out night , even garaged . you won't wash your car often if you use california duster . dust won't build up if you use it often enough . before discovering california duster , i found after washing my car , i could only use my car cover few days before car got too dusty put cover over . now i find i keep car dust free use car cover much longer , which turn means i don't wash car nearly often . i got plastic handle california duster which significantly cheaper time i ordered . although wood handle one looks classier probably feels nicer , plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy , value oriented , get plastic handle one since it exact same brush anyway ! i am really very happy what i paid calfornia duster would not hesitate recommend one anyone car or motorcycle . just aware what it not made car wet or very dirty . my only complaint it not actually made calfornia	1

first all ' 11 cubic feet ' means little me so if you wondering dimesions this bag , look no further ( because nor even lund web site you could find this valuable information ) . dimensions labeled box 44 " x36 " x16 " ( , , ) . so far i stuffed it six letter size stackable white cardboard boxes like those you find office depot ( 15.5 " 12.5 " x11 " ) intended your backlog ( willamette ) , it not easy first glance but , believe it or not , there enough room them . te curb aerodinamic shape ends some 18 " front side back reach 16 " claimed . me it seems like parabolic shape because height continues increase slightly up around 18 " backside . my 6 backlog boxes place there still some 26 " x36 " x5 " room above them . material seems strong , only think i don't like zipper wich seems regular one not one intended support strong wind force . well , two weeks i'll tell you what happened this bag during my 600 mile trip . so far , so good	1

i bought one these when they first came out , because we very hard water i hate shammying my car . soap doesn't foam up like it would if you bucket-washing , but it gets car just clean . i sort like it doesn't trigger device , it avoids accidentally spraying vehicle when you don't want . plus you don't wash your car bucket full dirty water . super-fast jet spray setting not useful me , but i'm sure you off-roaders would appreciate it . i don't agree reviewer who said it causes more water spots . i don't think they used it right . if you wash your car pretty often , this kit comes recommended	1
after reading review max i just let others know this product realy work great . it also saves me time . max problem may his whole process flawed i never read directions may how product tells you it , however all i simple . wet car ( my case truck ) down regular water then wash car , truck top down i use microfiber towel towel one hand mrclean autowash other . i wash soap rinse i go around car , truck . when it all washed down re-rinse regular water top down , change filtered water rinse again top down . i this part rather quickley it sprays just like spray paint gun . then just let it sit dry . reason i only give product 4 stars . seal cap soap compartment leakes storage if you dont prop it up just right or lay it its side . they really needed trigger water controll , off . i used this all last summer im sure i washed my truck least 20 times . my water filter still worked fine . it may my process how fast i get around truck or i may cleaner water then what they say only 10 washes per filter . i am back here get new one , beacuse i kept it outside well i cant expect it hold up hard freeze i ? heh	-1

i bought this product list price local auto store . expensive ( amazon much cheaper ) , sure , but it goes pretty thin , so bottle should last while . it really easy put remove . i used cotton applicator put wax over . it hazed over immediately just little pressure needed get wax car . i didn't rub hard or anything . i waited just minute ( probably not even necessary wait long ) buffed off good microfiber towel ( vroom stuff target worked great ) . i really shouldn't say " buffed " , because i didn't press all hard -- wax came off light moderate pressure . i found this quite bit easier apply than meg nxt wax . wax looks great . it deeper look it than most pure synthetics , but also some good shine it . my car darker color it added some depth it . i applied it my friend black car , it looked pretty wet . it some cleaners it , so it removed whatever fillers i my last wax exposed swirls little more . if you bothered your car swirls , you might want consider carnauba wax , it mask them better than this one . i've it my car 2 months now water still beading nicely . i doubt it last much longer , but i think 2 months not bad half-synthetic wax like this one . this top-of-the-line best-ever wax ? no , but it look great , it easy apply . so i recommend it all my friends who hate spending lot time waxing their car	1

seems amazon doesn't want sell this item because they don't tell most important thing it , it 0 - 60 psi gauge used tires needing 30 psi , give or take 10 . illustration incorrect , but they show same picture all different moroso gauges . i measured accuracy against digital it within . 5 psi . best thing it makes perfect instant seal tire . put little extra air , press button it accurate fill . i think rubber cover must . amazon best price	1
finally got try this item out when my wife i some bar hopping couple weeks ago . we delayed our drive home until device gave us all clear . course big question whether readings accurate without calibrated reference device hand , this currently remains unanswered . indirect evidence ( our known consumption rate , body weight , subjective feelings ) suggested device ballpark . since i access more accurate ( far more expensive ) tester work , i may attempt some experiments report back findings here . device very easy carry around quite unobtrusive . glancing it , one would assume it just keyless entry . it definitely good price point . since these type devices great aid responsible drinker alcohol , it would likely benefit society large if their use became common . it should remembered , however , one still cited most places while driving when bac above zero even if levels don't reach most serious dwi/dui standards so designated driver still remains best option .	-1

i just got this myself it works like charm . installation took atbout 1/2 hour it works just like it advertises . i couple things . i agree need place solar cell within couple inches garage door light . i sears craftsman flourescent bulb which enough solar cell right above light . there pressure stick pad holds solar cell onto garage door opener . there black 3-4 foot wire ( looks like rca audio wire plug ) connects solar cell laser beam generator which maybe 3/4 " long 3/8s inch wide . it too stick adhesive glued onto your garage ceiling . laser pivots easily so it aimed . actual beam emits pulsing red dot not bigger than 1/8 " wide onto your dashboard when you drive under it . it takes little getting used first know what look when you're parking . my garage ceiling 2 feet above roof car so it pretty close laser generator . if you higher ceiling , mounting probably harder but dot maybe slightly bigger . one thing i adjust my wife shorter than me so she sees beam alittle later than i sit up bit seat see it dashboard our toyota sienna which little flat . i need re-aim laser easier spot point her since this her parking slot . works like charm - just wish dot little bigger make it easier spot when you pull . great feature not any batteries or plug ins required	1

i used this haul 75-pound , 74-inch-long flat-pack furniture box 100 miles top 1994 toyota camry , it worked just fine . i my doubts when i bought it . i lost upholstered chair washington , dc beltway once -- tied it down rope it took off like kite . but this highland carrier job . when putting it together , save yourself some aggravation loop straps through plastic bases before you attach bases crossbars ( instructions tell you reverse , which makes threading next impossible ) . pieces attached firmly roof my camry , flat metal hooks going sills open doors . once doors closed there no way hooks come out . make sure straps tight before you close doors . this little tricky there seemed some slippage through buckles , but little tugging wiggling they snugged up pretty well . note rubber feet fit plastic bases provide grip protect your roof when carrier , but they fall off easily when it not use . i don't know why they weren't permenently attached . maximum recommended load 150 pounds but i didn't test it limit -- crossbars look sturdy but they're hollow metal tubes , they bounced little under weight box . also , bars textured finish but seemed little slippery , so i wrapped some gritty no-slip tape around them ( kind used stairsteps ) prevent any slippage . i attached box carrier two ratchet tie-downs ( highly recommended over rope ) . tie-down straps looped once around box under each crossbar box didn't budge whole trip home . one other thing , make sure tie up any dangling straps -- sound them whacking against roof your car very disconcerting . inexpensive solution that good temporary use light loads short trips cars don't roof racks . update : used carrier haul two same box camry , bringing load right up 150-lb maximum -- rock solid all way . i laid long boxes side-by-side longest width down spread out weight much possible , then duc t-t aped them together fastened them down good tight tie-downs rope ( overkill ? perhaps , but better safe than sorry sued . ) my next car probably small suv , but until then i'm glad i this carrier . inexpensive , easy use remove job	-1

nutshell : what you when it raining your tire goes flat wal-mart parking lot ? this happened me today i scared out my wits . i hour get home before my six-year-old son got off school bus . i 25 miles away i just saw my rear tire knew it no air it . i recalled using this product 6 years ago it worked , so i ran into wal-mart skipped items i come shopping went straight automotive section hunt this stuff . twenty minutes later , standing parking lot , i read directions realized i try find what leaking remove it if possible . after breaking small screwdriver bending key car we sold 5 years ago , i managed remove nail 4 inches long -- trouble rest air leaked out rather quickly once i pulled out nail . read follow directions ! directions stated valve stem 8 o'clock position so i my teenage daughter back car up until valve stem 8 o'clock position . i shook over 30 seconds angela timed me , then i screwed hose attachment into valve stem . it whooshed stream white , foamy liquid rushed through transparent tubing into tire . i could hear air rushing it but then i recalled what actually happened last time i used this stuff 6 years ago . you guessed it , hole towards top tire foam never got there allowing air simply escape very nosily out hole . since flat rear my front-drive plymouth voyager minivan , i drove it gas station i knew air , 6 miles away . i went 25 mph many people hailed me they drove alongside inform me i flat tire . but then something good happenedby time i reached chevron station air , still some 20 miles our home , i convinced i turned flat tire into spaghetti we would miss bus . well , i am happy report this not case . traveling slowly , tire circulated white sealant foam heated up some due extra friction caused running without air . i filled tire up my surprise there no sound escaping air . sealant held i drove , somewhat reduced speed , remaining 18-20 miles 38 minutes get home 2 minutes ahead bus . bottom line : air source nearby if you pull out nailthis stuff work , but after you pull out nail your tire it may rather difficult get it hold air before it circulate heat up within tire . this my actual experience this exact product today , it consistent what happened 6 years ago . short , air supply lined-up when you insert sealant close possible where you remove nail insert sealant . this reduce risk running tire flat rendering it unserviceable . if you this , you stand excellent chance executing fast emergency repair anybody manage , like me , you too might save day .
