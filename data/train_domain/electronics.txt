it speedy space saving inexpensive . i bought this replace my belkin because belkin needed plugged . this one powered your computer so there no extra power cords , which big plus me . only thing i dislike this fact hub takes up two usb ports instead just one like belkin .	1

just wanted echo what others said , these batteries seem really last . i received new camera using generic rechargeable batteries it , almost powerful 2500s here , batteries ran out after few hours . replaced those batteries these , these just seem last . am very happy them	1
i bought returned three these units now . each one defective , finally i just gave up returning system . dvd player constantly gives " bad disc " errors skips if there even slightest smudge disc . sound quality very nice price , but since player doesn't work , it essentially useless . this complete rip-off any price point	-1
dvds i burned successfully showed movies excellent quality . only problem every 3 good burns i get one bad one . i'm using plextor dvd burner ( love it !! ) , but i'm going try my luck different dvd brand . failure rate memorex unacceptable . it less cost bothers me , but more time wasted burning coasters	-1

when i purchased these batteries , i very pleased , but wore off after couple months . i don't use my camera all often , but when i , i expect ther batteries some charge . i recharge them per instructions , they not hold charge any longer . i know monster makes good products , but i am little disappointed this one	-1
ten minutes since i've it out box two pieces fallen off . more importantly , it can't handle large manuals advertised . ( reason i purchased this particular book holder ) my 1000 page manual only fits if you happen only want read middle chapter . based i estimate this totally worthless product anyone needing go through manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages . if you don't anticipate needing it book big then just glue rubber feet , keep eye page retainers ( these parts fell off ) you should ok . me , i'm off read amazon return policy see if i get rid this useless hunk plastic	-1
works well , especially anyone who still their old console systems use . i my nes snes , both which huge ac adapters , plugged into this . it saves tons space my power strip . design little clumsy though , so it only getting 4/5	1

i like it very much , i use it outdoor trail camera wild game it hold several pictures camera all kinds weather . i would buy kingston again	1
this great card reader price . why pay more if this one reads all cards you ? personally , i only use compactflash sd cards . it reads these cards it it fast reliably . shape this card reader bit awkward but then again it help you grab unit while inserting removing cards , which you'll want bit carefully . it would bit more difficult unit lying flat desk . remember never force card remember label side faces towards sandisk logo card reader . it slightly tricky get cards into slots first , but once you get feel it , it beccomes quite easy routine . this sandisk led indicators helpful . one amber led tell you unit connected your usb , other green ones each card slot let you know either you card insert ( solid green ) , or it reading or writing ( blinking green ) . this card reader comes 1 year warranty i feel it represents good value . i would recommend it	1
i used 25 pack these doing dvd backups , last 5 or so failed . i thought it my software , so i got new software . guess what ? my first disc out new package 25 i bought failed , too . it not my burner ( reviewer suggested , implying people should learn read ) , it brand new doesn't require firmware upgrade they mention . they just suck high failure rate . so consensus seems tdk or sony best . i'm buying some now save myself frustration	-1
please don't expect get cash back this purchase promised ! date , i've denied twice . second time they said u number invalid . only , it original u barcode ! i meticulous filing paperwork , yet they state , " all required products not submitted .

bought this month ago use my dx4330 kodak 3mp digital camera . it worked 2 days . after , everytime i camera , it wanted me reformat card , wth ? now i can't use it all .... i'm always so confidence my previous purchases amazon . one mistake i made , i threw away shipping product packages once i tested out card , thought it worked it would ok . i no longer return it now . needless say , i'm too over confident lexar products . buyers beware ...	-1
you get 4 pack emerging power 2100 mah batteries 9.95 this very site . i . they work great . why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just batteries . ridiculous	-1
this worst thing i ever owned !!!! it broke ( said there no cd inside ) after week ! yourself favor don't get this product , don't buy this brand don't buy sears they sucked whole thing too	-1
no free lunch you get what you pay ... verdict this product ? well , poor rating given those who purchased this product discouraged me buying it . i need disc binders case logic brand , while original , pricey . low cost alternatives needed , but not expense quality tco ( total cost ownership ) . but flap poor customer service ( rebates ) poor quality ( zippers sleeve binding ) enough give me pause ..... so , if someone xtreme management paying attention .... fix it or content lose business . price isn't everything everyone markt your product ..	1
before i bought this reader i considered 2 models 12-in-1 : lexar sandisk . i decided buy lexar . i bought this reader use mostly memory stick . i 2 cards : 128 mb 1 gb . i no problem 128 mb card . but i could not insert my gig card into this reader . it just not go . i tried hard trying not break card - no success . it surprise me . may because my card made not lexar - sandisk ...? i contacted lexar but not get any explanation this problem . any way i send it back buy 12-in-1 sandisk reader .	1
i not like this item because it says it 16x dvd but when i put it my burner it only reads it 4x . something wrong dvds because my burner one newest out there it 16x burner . so if you looking 16x , not buy this one	1

i purchased dvd express it never worked . i spent endless time tech support . old story , " it must your computer . " not fly either , my machine media type it far exceeds system requirements advertised ads . i exchanged item it supposedly checked out before i got it . same problems . tech support told me i only person trouble this product . they need check out few websites review products there hundreds bad reviews very few good ones . my only mistake not reading them before i wasted my time money . ads also told me it would not work ulead movie factory 3 , some software it came bundled , but uleads problem . i should use cap wiz ( their program ) duh !!! guess what , it not work their program either . ulead said they several complaints ads product . their final solution hold product maybe they new version cap wiz might work . save yourself time money aggravation buy product ! p.s. since ads doesn't consider product defective they not refund your money or allow you trade it upgrade . i don't think they want product like either . only reason i gave one star ..... it packed well . ju	-1
we bought this clock radio , got it home , set it up , realized it didn't battery back up , called sony only find out they not find it necessary put feature their alarm clocks .... how bizarre !! they not carry battery back up any their new models according their representative customer service center ! boxed it up it going right back where it came . if it okay not battery back up , it might deserve chance , however , what use alarm clock if you can't trust it indeed wake you up	-1
consider receiver before buying delorme . delorme receiver works only their software ( receiver not conform any standard , unlike most other receivers . ) delorme software itself not very accurate . just looking area few blocks surronding my home , i found 3 instances where facility shown located several blocks where it actually - but microsoft no problem locating facilities properly . finally , receiver i , even after device initialized , delorme software sometimes unable find it . ( i suspect because cable gps side sometimes pulls slightly out , but fiddling it doesn't seem accomplish much ) . real irritating out road , it when you find one their printed atlas misbound lacks several pages	-1
