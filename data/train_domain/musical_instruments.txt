i bought this item my son piano practice . it worked ok terms sound speed , until second day when on/off switch broke off . then i noticed plastic attachment switch very thin start . my opinion , this flaky product since on/off switch used many times every day so it sturdy .	1
cheap , cheap , cheap- i know you get what you pay , but 20 bucks(after shipping ) lot pay nothing return . thing didn't respond my guitar , store said it probably defective return it . but , you don't get repaid any shipping , so it hardly worth effort . buying this just resulted headache frustration .	-1
contrary vendor arrival date , one my items placed backorder nearly month . i not notified change only found out when i inquired phone . customer representative not apologize company not offer any form resolution inconvenience . first product arrived good shape on-time , but i am dissatisfied customer service when mistake made	1
i first ordered this guitar color after week checking mail my little boy every day , i informed it out stock . i re-ordered bodacious blue it came friday . it literally came cardboard box you would buy it off shelf no packing besides plastic bag around guitar like your newspaper would come . there no packaging slip . i took it out plastic body guitar damaged around edge . there little divit size raisin where it looked like it hit something pretty hard . there literally slack strings , so they tightened . it would not stay tune i would tighten strings you could see them loosen again immediately . my little boy began play out tune guitar sounded terrible next day one strings broke !!! this toy piece junk . sales pitch says fully functional guitar ... great value money .... hahaha ! i thought this would great starter guitar little investment . i would only recommend this if you needing prop or decoration some kind . it certainly isn't playable ! i no slip send it back what i would pay shipping would probably near what i paid thing . don't waste your money !	-1
this item cheap junk i bought this item when i got it it didn't work after hours fiddling it it finally worked but sound terrible when i pulled plug out back after day it said it chargable but it wasn't it would not work without plug attached it when i started play it it kept making this annoying banjo like sound it wouldn't stop you not play any fast songs this because it can't keep up you not play more than one note time keys aren't really raised it just like pressing cell phone buttons plastic so cheep it almost broke when i pressed one button after shipping handling total $56 not buy this item cheap junk if you want roll up keyboard go look somewhere else	-1
1 . forget headphones , if you're interested playing guitar , you need actually hear what you play . so , replace them , first thing . 2 . amplifier terrible , so if you want this thing just practice home ... well , supposing you care nothing sound then it ok . but then , why play guitar first place ? so , sum it up , if you play guitar , you respect yourself , spend some money buy something decent . this item you may want give away birthday present 7-year old	1
only song i know 12-string electric it rush xanadu , so i let ' er rip . sounded good . i alot fun playing around it . however , after hour or so goofing around i noticed two things really ticked me off . firstly , outer tines already broken . tines look like wound steel guitar string , but core very brittle . they didn't completely fall off , they just hung there like limp whatevers . secondly , plastic p'up cover pick guard looked like they scrubbed wire brush . i easily fix those , but i wonder what such abrasive pick strings if i play it alot . it looks like you only strum down stroke . videos jellyfish website confirm this . problem you're going against grain upstroke it catches strings . how much fun it only play down strokes ? it kind hard grasp , too . it needs thumb dimple . i'm going make one using more flexible wound guitar stings see if its any better . if you've got $10 blow , go ahead get one	-1
you know how when regular pick hits your strings , you hear sound it hitting string , then after it releases string reverberates you hear note ? well imagine hearing 15 picks hit string before string produces music . 15 picks made coiled wire . i can't imagine worse sound or feeling .	-1

i very disappointed this product . it child yet wood string holder not even attached guitar . this product lasted whole two days before part fell off you could no longer use guitar . tuners also unable tighten so you basically piece useless wood shaped like guitar .	-1

videos amazing ! i would say better than amazing . riffs , solos taught fun work well level they correspond , i feel progresses well beginner beyond consistant speed . only problem ... there grey area overlaps term beginner intermediate so you may skip around lessons get track course . instance i decided learn riffs practice pull offs beginner dvds go straight into intermediate levels course beginner sections where way easy . but i would say if powerful riffs electrifying solos your passion then i know no other course get you there quicker while more fun doing it	1
shure sm58 one most recognisable microphones world - good reason . it main stay many hire companies microphone hire stock , including mine ( pa2hire.co.uk ) . practically unbreakable , if you manage drop it high stage / skyscraper , you also buy replacement pop shield . very suited rock , or other musical styles need powerful vocals . make sure your singers lips touching pop shield get best results , though , unless they very good mic technique . proximity effect ( increase bass when you sing or talk close mic ) makes this important . if singer foot away sm58 , chances they sound thin , you also gain before feedback issues .... sonically response nice presence peak upper mid range , but top end rolls off quickly after . opinion split whether good or bad thing - it helps keep lid feedback , but it doesnt sound hi-fi some other mics . i some singers complain their vocal top end not quite right - sometimes asking more top end . i guess they used sound expensive condenser mics their recordings . my solution normally give them mic , like beta 58 , or beta 87a maybe , rather than use eq . if you a/b test sm58 verses these mics it always lose . but it still better mic some cases , such when you looking cardioid rather than hyper-cardioid response ( sm58 cardioid response , which means it wider pickup pattern front ) . but most vocalists more than happy sound sm58 gives . sm58 also pretty good job drums ( not really bass drum ) , other loud things like guitar cabs . it uses same capsule sm57 , one best mics guitar cabs . conclusion , yes there lot mics sound better , some these quite bit cheaper - but ask yourself question they durable sm58 , if you professional , your clients want use mic they never heard ? take care , justin millerpa2hire . co . u	1
when i got my sr60 i immediately put it . headphones comfortable easily adjusted my head . i noticed foam fairly large cells it . my only previous experience this type foam not good , deeriorating very quickly but i am hoping these last longer . sound quite clean balanced . most phones this price range , there lack base . i able compare these side side sr80 , i may paid difference price get bit more base . overall , i rate these very good fairly priced	1
i finally caved sprung pair these headphones over weekend . after few days , i say i am truly impressed . i bought returned many pair headphones after dissatisfied . i not doing so these . accordingly , i'll try write some comments could help other people their purchase . there few things keep mind when selecting headphones . it also important keep mind any headphones , sound quality depends quality medium which you listening , well ability device drive headphones . my immediate impression sr60'swas bass bit weak ( matching few other comments here ) high-end treble bit subdued well - but after few days trying different kinds music listening different players , i decided neither weak all ; sounds simply much more accurately reproduced than most headphones i'd previously experienced . very significant : these headphones maintain almost identical tonal balance regardless listening volume . i've never encountered before , used headphones sound more " bright " or " warm " volume increases . i believe most budget headphones , if they aren't completely lacking bass , tend exaggerate certain frequencies beyond what you'd hear live performance . here my logic : i tried listening few different tracks sr60s , all high-bitrate mp3s : -- pride prejudice soundtrack ( 2005 ) - dario marianelli - " liz top world " - ( orchestral , dominated piano strings ) - any concerns weak bass blown out door within 30 seconds . it honestly sounded like * real piano * sitting my living room . who knew string section could so much ambiance ? i used appreciate this track its music ; notes carry lot emotion . i now understand what people mean appreciating particular * performance * well . -- alison krauss union station - " lucky one " - ( vocal , bluegrass ) - you clearly discern * specific * guitar picks , streaking noises made musicians ' fingers they slide up down strings ... alison krauss ' crystal clear voice just shines . it sounds like live performance . -- max graham feat . jessica jacobs - " i know you re gone " ( original mix ) - ( vocal trance ) - i've much ballyhooed this track one all time best examples vocal trance . it also good sound testing song , since it based throbbing bass line bouncy rhythms , but breaks down into section where it just jessica voice , piano , strings . i must listened this song 200 times last year , yet i picked up several new nuances first listen these headphones . few negatives these headphones , now i've played them : -- yes , they bulky . you probably won't want use them gym . i able tolerate them treadmill , but actually lifting weights or otherwise doing things requiring changes posture , i'll probably stick my koss ksc75 ( awesome bargain themselves less than $20 , though now i've tried grados , koss bass seems bit artificially inflated ) . -- these * really * leak sound . whim , i spun headphones put them so outside my ears , foam pads facing outward . they actually sounded louder way ( if muffled ) than drivers properly facing my ears . open air design it advantages - i think it partly how these headphones create illusion sitting among musicians - but people around you may think you blasting your music even if it isn't really loud you . -- these headphones * * expose flaws source media , possibly your playback device well . i can't stomach 128kbps mp3s anymore . when your headphones get this accurate , such music seems life flattened out it . i tried listening few beatles songs , there certain frequencies missing . it sounded like i listening reel-to-reel tape . oh wait , songs probably mastered reel-to-reel . my overall impression extremely favorable . sure , sound quality somewhat subjective matter , but if your goal life-like sound , you want come closer what studio recording sounded like , these headphones awesome effort price .	1
this great product money . novice , it easy use . instructions pretty thin but it simple figure out . useful tool	1
my wife bought 3 small children zithers amazon , none them tune - so i picked up this wonderful reasonably priced item put them tune good order . it very simple setup , easy follow directions . within 10 minutes each , i all 3 zithers tune ' zeveral ' ( ahem ! ) 5 year olds treating me ' my darling clementine ' 3-way stereo .....	1
someone who knows nothing guitars how tune them , this tuner " must " ! came w/batteries ( aaa ) clear instructions . 1)turn 2)pick string 3)adjust until you get correct note . once i looked up correct notes , it simple . it even tell me if i'm playing correct cord . i tried tune listening beginner cd trying replicate sound they suggest , but computer speakers , it just doesn't work . this little tuner rocks !	1
this drum set awsome affordable . it nice clean but deep sound , works any type music . but since america now scared reading , it seems people neglecting notice while picture cymbols , it clearly printed it not come cymbals . 5 star though	1
i ordered this guitar my 4 yr old grandson xmas after he became interested my guitar . company fantastic job it shipped received time xmas . guitar surprising detailed not like those plastic ones you see stores fishing line strings .. these real steel strings extra string just case . only draw back so far keeping one strings taunt . there adjustment screw back each tuning peg but if you constantly tighten it , it becomes loose .. overall my grandson completely amused his " tar " spends hours playing us songs ... thank	1
after long spell out society i advised best way get back touch my fellow man through medium music . my parole officer advised me creative activities such playing instrument tend show us how cultured worthwhile lives humans , rather than looking one fellow man fetid putrid beast . i always enjoyed listening music whilst not equipped learn any complex instrument percussion definitely where it me ! i purchased this pulse triangle means beginning road becoming next phil collins or ringo star . i found pulse triangle easy use rewarding results . i am able add my own accompaniment most tunes , fleetwood mac ' albatross ' nirvana ' smells like teenspirit ' . i some trouble mastering later higher tempo tunes tend difficult keep up . my girlfriend likened me epileptic gymnast she watched me playing william tell overture . summary if you looking way into music want simple instrument tests water then pulse triangle you . it cheap , enjoyable very forgiving . however it not recommended playing naked	1
mic cheap , stand nice but what combo deal ! i likes i like	1
this excellent buy built-in sound system . we bought it our church , everyone extremely pleased it . we couldn't believe we got whole package less than $30 including shipping ! everything plugged perfectly , no adapters needed . service amazing , too ; it here two days after we ordered . thanks	1
metronome everything i expected . i wanted metronome very loud so it could heard while playing ensemble also one volume control . sound loud enough heard while playing ensemble good volume control . it not digital so one easily switch tempos . it light enough easily carried around . what i would liked , but not expect tempo range goes beyond 40 - 208 . unfortunately , seeems found only digital .	1
we've tried several brands metronomes , now our family two seiko sq-50s use . best feature clicks you hear crisp quality sound not irritating like other metronomes we tried . it so easy use , even youngest child it . size just right -- small enough fit beside music music stand or piano , but large enough it not easily lost	1
this first metronome we owned so can't really compare others . but this one reliable very easy our daughter use . it loud which good her hear over her piano playing . headset option great when we , parents simply cannot distraction . our daughter much more solid practice session result this metronome . only drawback dial only includes certain tempo markings .... very wide range , but not every number . this not pose significant problem . though when piano teacher advises practice tempo marking this not we forced accommodate . but otherwise , very good	1
i bought used flames strap eddie it feels ( looks ) great . i love it my bro well , very good buy	1
nice mic great price . however , it doesn't include pop filter which essential . i shocked find these filters cost much mic	1
i two these because they're so cheap use them mainly home if i musical idea . one reviewers above mentioned it bit muddy which i totally agree . but it incredibly cheap fairly detailed amount money . i'm curious how it hold up over years use . anyway , this probably perfect " step-up " mic podcasts if you currently recording your computer built-in mic or radio shack dynamic mic . i would choose this over m-audio mics- it feels slightly more durable	1
some reason i tend shred most regular picks very quickly . this pick nickel plating lasts long time . also gives nice sound	1
im no pro but once you get these bongos tune them , they sound nice . i jam them all time quality gets better better skins thin out , sound comes out lot more . definitely worth 20 bucks	1
this nice harmonica convenient hard case . it good size ( like old marine band ) , it plays easily , good tone . only problem couple notes keep sticking won't play . i wedged them open but they stuck again . oh well , it still nice	1
i started playing harmonica earlier this year couple supercheap hohner products , then picked up this one . it costs more , but it worth it . it loud , clear notes , good playing single notes , two-draw uniquely warm friendly . superior marine band , golden melody , lee oskar .	1
i'm playing lee oskar right now . love it .... o yea ! i play nothing else . hohner good , but give me lo any day . they so airtight , sound so sweet .	1
this decent harmonica decent harmonica player .. if you haven't played many harmonicas you're generally beginner then i recommend this harmonica you but if you play pretty good , you deserve something better than this ... it dosen't go too loud dosen't clearest quality but price what you expect ? even if it dosen't clearest quality , it still decent quality , it great it price even if it cheap ... so , highly recommended beginner that why i gave it 4 out 5 stars	1
lee oskar harp plays well . easy keep clean plastic body constructed maintainability which improve overall lifetime harp	1
i've seen tuners come go , mostly high cost . i bought this tune both my guitars my violin , so far it hasn't let me down . i thought i good ear tuning but this little gadget quickly corrected me now my guitar sounds better than ever ... highly recommended	1
this tuner makes it pretty easy tune ( it jack input microphone ) , but it doesn't much range . tolerance seems only step or setp-anna-half , so if your strings off more than , you'll tune ear little first	1
celluloid guitar picks burn like dickens . it totally cool : just hold lighter ' em they go up flash ! careful not hold them your fingers , though , because fire very hot it burn you . just remember " fire bad ! " you won't go too far wrong . if you're looking picks play guitar , celluloid worthless . they're fragile , surface far too slick if your hands sweat all . try tortex or delrins . tortex business , my experience . i should note every one guitar picks mentioned this review fully compatible all major operating systems except cpm/80 old incompatible time-sharing system mit , except delrins , which create sort tesla-coil effect when used one's-complement integer systems . but you don't run into those very often these days so it not big issue . besides , it looks cool .	1
i use em practice , they're cheap nice picks , look pretty cool too	1
i own couple tambourines , but played few . this one light , bright kinda cool looking . inward placement handle allows it played windshield wiper style , wrist , or combination both allowing great speed variety . you also get two different soundings hits whether you use inner or outer ring . hit inner ring more open sound outer more dry close one . all all nice tambourine specially price	1
i bought program reason tutorial dvd simultaneously so i really not opportunity play software before viewing dvd . said i could not see using program effectively without dvd . this first true piece audio software i ever purchased so visual/audio aid guide me step step through process lifesaver . beginners standpoint dvd uses some terms unfamiliar kind hard grasp . but repeated viewings i am able make some great music . i would recommend this dvd anyone who purchased program reason	1
i purchased these strings through amazon affilaite telsonusa they excellent strings would cost three times much music stores .	1
years i used rat distortion boxes guitar bass . now i play bass lot more bands , find rat sound weak one dimensional . i sold off my rat tried out number other distortion boxes local shop settled big muff pi . this thing rich . complexity distortion incredible compared what you get most other pedals -- must brilliant russian engineering behind it . it three knobs : volume , sustain , tone . volume obvious , sustain really distortion level . bass , i run sustain very low , volume higher get great mix clean distorted tone . sometimes i run sustain knob turned all way off this thing still drives sound nicely . too much distortion bass you loose your ability cut through rest band my opinion . tone knob adjusts center frequency distortion . i run mine way over left distort low end around 200-400 khz . you crank it around get anything low grumbly distortion tall way really tinny irritating heavy metal sound . this thing versatile , no matter how you like your settings , distortion it produces rich harmonic overtones , multi-dimensional , unlike any other boxes i've tried . highly recommended . my only complaint this box designed work only battery power -- no ac adapter all . fortunately now there adapter one-spot connected battery lead then ac adapter . hopefully amazon start carrying soon .	1

this great sounding pair headphones , however , after couple uses right side headphone just stop receiving any sound . not sure problem , but i stated unit sounded great . that why 4 stars . refund received without any problem . not happy i pay shipping , which , why i not ask replacement	1
i purchased these 1 month ago used " burn " method leaving my grado running music 6 days straight open up components headphones good sound very impressed . i say they bit uncomfortable first but its worth it good sound fact pads adjust soften up after while . it also no where near painful my ordeal my first pair canalphones which e2c's(see my other reviews ) . anyways ... subject sound i say its all around winner its smooth but punchy bass its open soundstage which i guess results open ear design they , although some don't like retro look these phones i've really gettin into them late , big plus rotating cups thick cable which guarantee long life these cans . i also gotta give grado credit it expandability amps different cups which leave me hunting new components seeing i'm merely just budding audiophile long way go limited budget wont let me upgrade my setup whenever i want(cries ) ... . . if you use these your computer there pops hisses its because grado too good card which resulted me buying new 24bit external sound card creative gave me real boost sound quality . so overall these good pair cans someone who loves their music but just can't afford buy latest greatest world sound	1
price , i expected toy . i surprised open box find honest goodness classical guitar . construction , fit finish impeccable . sound certainly not concert quality , but expected $50 dollar instrument . tuning reasonably accurate , it pleasure play . i told me son it he going buy one his son .	1

these stands used schools , colleges , professionally least 45 years . they nearly industructible , very reliable , easy use . avoid clip lights ... they also decades old design . they only throw light top music very poor conditions such found musicals or opera .	1
grado world wide reputation best sound reproduction their cans ( audiophile speak headphones ) they awards back them up ! too often though , i've read reviews where comfort criticized these ear cushions allegedly blame . nonsense ! it true grado cans supraural ( ear ) opposed circumaural ( around ear ) so you feel unit against your ears . these cushions redesigned back 1998 , offering greater thickness distance transducer so you feel more comfortable while listening through your cans design allows greater soundstage magnificent grado cans impress you . these cushions , called " l-cush " here , used every single pair current grado cans except perhaps $1000 set . i use them my sr60 , which come standard foam cushion covers whole transducer it made them sound quite nearly good sr80's! i recommend them you wholeheartedly ! if you google " listening station , " place purchase any grado product	1

korg makes good stuff all way around , this tuner no exception . it affordable easy use . i second those who suggest checking batteries regularly ; tuner become iffy if they wear down . however , this not uncommon battery-operated tuning devices . all all , this great deal it'll help you keep your instrument ready-to-play condition	1

bought father day gift my husband , who interested learning play . very moderate price , it seems very good value money	1
i saw this guitar sale ordered it whim , thinking if it no good i could use it canoe paddle or give kits play . i played bass recreationally 17 years , occasionally strummed guitar here there . i currently own classical guitar i've 10 years , sold my steel-string guitars several years ago . i wanted this replace steel stringed ones , take camping , when i didn't want take fairly nice classical guitar risk its damage . when i opened box , i astounded find guitar very fine black finish , action almost perfect , actually nearly tune . it looks great sounds very good . sealed tuners very smooth kept guitar tune thusfar . only flaws i could see small bit glue where fretboard met top , just soundhole , very slight overlap some binding glue onto body , maybe 0.2 mm 1mm , only noticable when looking it . soundwise , it sounds very good , especially considering cost . it sounds especially good pick . treble side guitar bright clear . bass side it little thin , low ' ' fairly dull when fingerpicking . i am hoping changing stock strings might help it little . it passable , just not great . frets very good , smooth . ends nicely rounded . i expected need polish frets , but this point leave them as-is . sum it up , i think this guitar complete steal price if you beginner looking start , or if you want spare guitar keep lakehouse or take camping . it plays very good looks even better . like i said , i intended take this one camping , but it almost too nice	1
first let me just say i'm big fan danelectro . i own six their effects pedals addition this amp . they make excellent products what they charge i've impressed almost everything i've bought them . headphone amp - first off you might well throw out headphones it comes , they're crap . but that expected i guess . aside , everything else performs very well . it definitely loud enough , distortion good , however it pretty fuzzy gets noisy higher volumes . echo this thing , ( which main reason i decided get this instead rockman ) awesome . it sounds exactly like my classic slap echo pedal . it very clear stays consistent distortion or off higher volumes . i like line out option but i haven't tried it yet . it cool idea though . it smaller than i thought it going which pleasant surprise . it size pack cigarettes , maybe little bigger . definately small enough keep your pocket . it also very lightweight . my only real complaint retarded sea foam green color , cheesy fake chrome but who cares , no one ever sees it anyway . overall i'd definately reccomend this amp anyone looking mini headphone amp (...) . dean headphone amp looks like it could decent but it doesnt come echo it hard find .	1

i know lot guitarists aren't near picky picks i am . so why should you ? after all , there no pick make you play better they all generally same . wrong . i thought too first . i figured it just piece plastic , how hard it pick one ? i started out fender pick because they looked pretty conventional they moderately priced . i blindly went through ten these due them all breaking . if you knew me well you'd know i thrash my guitar ... lot ... even thickest picks would wear down me within week , most them too slick stay my sweaty hand during these crash burn guitar playing moments . i came realize i needed heavy duty pick good grip would retain it shape least couple weeks . first i thought metal answer . i mean , it hard rock most them come good grip them . but after playing them i discovered sound not my liking . it sounded too buzzy metal . that time i discovered tortex picks . i amazed . they best grip i ever felt kept their shape weeks ! i instantly bought every size i could get all way thinnest read bulky blue one . months later i'm keeping stock these picks my house . solos i prefer green one because it got just right resistance fast picking but not too much so it slows you down . strumming i use orange . it just perfect ... i cannot express you how much you need try this pick . your wasting your money anything other than dunlop . get tortex see what i mean	1
i really enjoy playing this harp whenever i get chance because it produces very good sound without blow or suck lot air . i found it very easy bend notes , fact this first harp which i able bend notes . roundedout edges also very nice hands it makes it easier hold . it made plastic not wood but hasn't caused problem so far . so i would reccomend hohner golden melody any key anyone . although i would choose one key , if you're begginer because it would easier learn i think	1

there no such thing " best string " . experimenting over years , i've found , while i " old standbys " first thing i try , often there string just right particular guitar it varies guitar guitar . coated strings become all rage over last few years . they're expensive , but they last lot longer , especially if you kind body chemistry causes them corrode quickly . also , they minimize amount finger noise you get if you slide strings . elixir polywebs first coated string . coating much heavier than other strings . this produces much less bright , more muted sound . i old koa guitar so bright i can't stand it standard strings . elixir polywebs tone it down point where it perfect . if you're looking darker sound , then elixir polywebs definitely worth shot . if you want coated string but prefer brighter sound uncoated strings , then you definitely don't want polywebs . 4 stars applies if you want this particular type sound . if you don't want this sound , you could end up awarding them 1 star	1

these standard strings i've using since 2000 . after going through only 4 pairs since then , i doubt i'll changing brands . especially this price . just look . just any store they're up 3 times expensive . don't let price fool you . sure , there some strings around 20 bucks , but doesn't mean they're better . ernie ball one ( if not , ) top brands when it comes musical instruments accessories . sound quality tone these suckers phenominal . you bend , whammy , slap pluck these things hard you , they won't break . fact , i've same set strings since october 2003 they're still working like day i put them . there isn't whole lot say strings . i mean , they're what you need play guitar that it . these work well , therefore , they're good . nab few extra sets these while they're so cheap	1
i agree previous reviewer . i'm giving this item five stars because it exactly what we hoped it would : reasonably-priced way get students started zills . there no convenient local source zills so we stock up then sell students , price/value these zills makes possible .	1
this classic boss pedal , it around awhile . boss known their great sounding effects rugged construction their products , this one no different . distortion this pedal simple , very smooth , very versatile . it not too noisy , allowing single notes played heard clarity . if you'd like hear it , you probably find some sound clips it used boss website	1

i bought this light after looking web . it seemed sold everywhere . however no one seems tryed it . it not even light up title my music much less complete page . musicans beware this mighty dull	-1
i got this light before led lights started coming out retail channel . those lights tend almost too bright , but they advantage running ages tiny batteries . unfortunately , this light uses 4 aa batteries which makes it fairly hefty . it alternatively operate ac adapter . this makes it lighter , but it still bulky because battery compartmen t.t he good : light nicely bright natural quality that easy eyes . it ratcheting arm so you put it where you want it stays there ( better than most flexible arm ones)includes ac adapter slot ( though no ac adapter)can help weigh down lighter books keep pages turningnice large clamp attaching books . lamp shade which allows you throw light where you want without blinding your vision . decent quality plastic - made chinathe bad : no brightness adjustment . heavy ( benefit some cases ) makes holding up book all more tiring . bulky - makes it really hard book sit properly your hand . ratcheting mades loud click which wake your wife bed . :-) clip very limited strength seems slip easily . eats up batteries fairly quickly - i use rechargeables it now . i'm giving it even 2 because it pain use , really . hopefully i find light weight led clip-on which brightness adjustment quiet arm stays place most importantly - natural lighting . if so , i'll review it here - but most leds wash out page making it hard read . nice quality lamp only reason this one doesn't get 1.5 stars	-1
if you buying this set beginner ( i mean just started playing ) then fine , this set not come cymbals even if it come hi-hats , crash cymbal , ride cymbal , they would terrible sounding . if you playing few years dont get this set , this set really only meant kids early beginners , because i'm 14 playing 4 years , i'm still beginner i would not buy this set , so think it ove	-1

better just throw it away rather than saddle someone mistake i made . thank goodness , it not costly ... not waste your money this toy tuner ... this tuner not sensitive enough any use all .. cannot buy worthwhile , more costly instrument ? go guitarplayersclub.com, site fender put up ama pro players alike .... there tuner there , free comes very close expensive one ... exception ? no where put your quarter .....	-1
i bought this low priced pedal mainly my daughter starter . my surpise , there no power supply included ! not even battery . no mention amazon product description power supply unit not included . i also bought other two models ... one them picks up radio station broadcasts it thru amp , yet , there isn't radio station tower within 5 miles my house . all all , i feel i got ripped off . if i known they not come power supplies , i would not purchased them	-1

i'm really dissapointed this guitar . i just bought it after 3 days tuned bridge cracked completely . sound nice but using guitar only during 3 days , it non acceptable . i made sure string not overstressed tuned electronic tuner just top 3 sets strings ( , , ) tuned octave apart ( tuned same octave ) avoid stress guitar . but even , bridge cracked . wood bridge not rosewood but low quality wood , cause damage	-1
jellifish no replacement twelve string guitar . you not play it fast , it fragile , tone scratchy . said it used make some interesting sounds color rhythm slow lead playing . it not something i would use often . my 1.00 mm clayton feels sounds great after after few minutes playing jellifish . after one hour use jellifish starting show signs wear tear . so don't say you weren't warned .	-1
this guitar i receieved warped neck ; how dare you send this product out	-1
i ordered this guitar my grandson christmas . there no way keep strings tight even though you turn screws tighten . when you tighten , strings brittle ( if really old ) break . get refund this item you obtain rma , pay return shipping ( which probably almost much guitar ) they issue refund after they receive guitar back . so i probably out $10.00 !	-1
worst quality i ever seen - bought three all three horrble . scratched , screws won't tighten ... shocked lack quality control .	-1
contrary product description , this stool not heavy duty ! actual seat itself made very flimsy plywood , any sort bad posture or leaning forward crack it punch metal supports through it ! legs also hard adjust optimum length , retention screw doesn't hold anything place long . if you find something somewhere else , i say go it	-1
well i don't much say . anyone who lot vocal performance sees these suckers everywhere . not only they terribly common , they common because they good sturdy mics . good sound quality ! happy mine . shure making good mics forever . it definitely safe buy any performer , especially vocalists	-1
this excellent , general purpose microphone reasonable price . i'm classically trained vocalist , i use sm58 rehearsal " scratch " recordings . it delivers clear , true , warm sound under all standard conditions requires essentially no fine tuning or signal processing . i still prefer crisp detail condenser microphone formal demo recordings ( my favorite studio projects c1 ) , but it hard beat simplicity reliability sm58 everyday use	-1
i am professional musician . i loved my grado sr60 so much when i chance buy used grado sr80 i so . i can't tell huge difference two . sr60 tad more comfortable . i keep one set my bed listen beethoven quartets late night . separation instruments lovely . quality wonderful - very smooth lifelike . i can't imagine better set headphones . there clear difference these my earbuds - although i lie my side my head pillow earbuds grado i stay my back . but they so comfortable i don't mind i t.t he other set grado i keep my rowing machine . i appreciate long , heavy , indestructible cord . set i listen loud rock roll or traditional irish music . it never gets harsh i turn up volume it sounds great . i know there more expensive cans out there but i doubt improvement would justify higher price . if you wondering whether spring higher priced sr80 set , my advice would save $30 stick sr60 . i don't feel sr80 much improvement . either earphone wonderful	1
best quality sound mid treble ranges . bass some what weak . clear , detail non distorted tones emerge into balanced inner stage headphone . no other headphone under hundred dollars comes close sound purity . biggest flaw cord wires easily break creating shorts loss one or both sides . i am my 3rd pair due wire breakage . repairs profesionals not successful . if you afford it buy extension cord lower risk wire breakage	-1
reason i'm rating this 4 i don't experience other chromatictuners , so i can't say it top line . but .... i find it very easy use love itbeing versatile giving me 3 choices/modes tuning my violin . price alsovery buyer friendly . it good mic it , my voice sharp , my laughter emiddle . ;o )	-1
this chromatic tuner , powered one aaa battery , built-in mike acoustic instruments plugin electrics . lcd dial shows specific tone , lights red if too high or too low , green when you it just right . i used it several 6-string ( acoustic ) guitars , 12-string 5-string banjo . results incredible- reliable true . years , i tuned ear . you know ... 5th fret , etc . what i didn't realize " " not just " " - there may ( ! ) thousands tones - all which " e " - this explains why though tuned ok ear , one chord would sound fine while others would sound out tune . this tuner fixes . tune tune . i found it among best ( least expensive ) musical investments i ever made - i wonder how i tolerated way i sounded before i discovered it - let alone what others may experienced ! great piece equipment great price . i recomment it heartily	1
i slightly concerned this product one poor review ( even though there more positive than negative reviews ) instruction manual easy read helpful . even if you're just starting out don't wanna tune ear , this way go . within 10 minutes taking it out box i able use it correctly . i highly recommend this . enjo	1

i didn't know this brand before ( i'm not particularly audiophile ) but i wanted good isolating headphones , good price . price ($50 ) sound quality excellent , they small fit provided pouch ; really nice touch small volume control embedded cable . sound scomparable sennheiser bose sets costing twice or three times much . only downside metal band make headphones not very comfortable beginning , but you get used it , it not big deal . overall i highly recommend this , sounds excellent matches white ipod :-)	1
i am pleased get this stuff very soon . however , i thought i got blue one ( center circle ) because they show picture customer like blue one . so , i expected get blue one , but seller sent me red one . it not matter color , but someone like me wants get same product you show me online . overall , i am satistifed this product . well , my metronome scratch already , so ,, careful !!	-1
just bought metronome johnson instrument , it looks quite different picture . new verson looks sleeker , which nice . it very compact put student violion case carry around . it volumn control , which completely muted only light flashed , which excellent feature . light larger . however , sound tone this new version changed . don't think i like part too much , too electronic .. but overall , it quite good .	-1

i am extremely pleased quality this purchase featured capability replace reed plate if should ever needed , rather than buying complete new harmonica . i consider myself beginner wanted something would durable long lasting money i spend . i considered hohner piedmont blues 7 piece harmonica set but after reading some customer feedback i decided go lee oskar diatonics which better quality .	1
this tuner job . it got cheap looking case , but it works that important part . one guy below said it too difficult open battery door ... battery door little tough open , but seriously , how much you need open it . also it takes aaa which cheaper than 9v . anyway , not bad buy , but watch out other things musician friend . i also ordered strap gigbag which both specifically stated they acoustic bass they way too small . tuner ok though	-1
i am beginner learning guitar this product helps me tune my quitar jiffy . awesome product	1
i use this tuner my violin . i use automatic setting found it very easy use . " needle " screen shows if you below or above note , once i put fine tuners my violin , tuning became very quick process . like others , i found installing battery annoying . it easier if you focus pushing one side tab time . directions not helpful someone unfamiliar tuners . pressing pitch button raises hz . my teacher prefers hz 441 vs 440 , so i able use setting . i highly recommend this tuner beginning musicians . it accurate easy use	-1

whether it listening classical , rock , or hip hop these headphones deliver clarity you not experience unless buy $4000 ~ $8000 set speakers . $100 you get same level quality . but word warning ; these change way you listen music they make your ears more discerning clarity music . i absolutely love them .	1
sr80 best headphone i've ever owned . twenty-some years ago i bought set koss headphones cost me half month salary ( 220 dollars ) these grados make those sound like set free earplugs monaural transistor radio 1960 . very smooth response , these cans better than any source components i own . they almost perfect travel , though i'll probably end up purchasing set their cans ipod -- drivers same ones this model , or so i've told . these pull instruments out recording , their ability image instruments spatially only matched clarity they bring vocals azam ali niyaz or early recordings joan baez . only improvement grado could make would improving headband connection -- it held place straight piece wire , left come undone headband . more comfortable foam would nice too , long it didn't compromise sound quality .	1
this real guitar . it take while get it tuned properly due new strings , so patient . if you child guitar fixation , then this just fix . it too small 6 year olds so sure get 3/4 size them . but this guitar real nicely made such low price .	1
we bought this guitar our smaller seven year old son . it hard choose guitar , because there so many out there ... toy version real ... but which choose ? this one worth pos . feedback i am giving it . it seemed so small cute when i opened it , but it perfect little hands bodies ! i found price very reasonable since we aren't sure if he " keep interest " , ( some toy ones cost close this ) but yet i wanted him feel like he getting real guitar , hopes he keep learning . i found guitar very nice , not toy all , tunes well , looks very attractive sounds nice too . i impressed it came warranty . i am happy i didn't spend close this toy versions ... i got real deal instead . shipping incredibly fast this company	1
we got this our 21-month-old boy , who loves music always trying play his dad guitars . it perfect size looks just like his daddy black accoustic . he absolutely loves it . manufacturers smart put tuning keys bottom neck , not draw too much attention ( which helps maintain life strings ) . my only complaint bridge not secured so it always coming lose falling into body guitar . i keep intedning superglue it ... otherwise i think this great toy toddlers who into music .	-1

i've playing guitar 45 years , acoustic , electric , nylon string . i like korg tuners find them best , particularly money , not only my guitars but also my fiddle my banjos . they small , sturdy , no frills . they accurate inexpensive . they work easily . this only real guitar tuner i like . i other guitar tuners pretty good not really guitar tuners but chromatic tuners guitar settings . this small accurate sturdy fits easily inside your shirt pocket or inside small compartments guitar case . it features other settings which great alternate tunings . don't fooled intellitouch other strap ons . you can't figure out all their arrows well dial korgs others . they too much trouble use especially you doing precision work like setting up adjustable bridge . only thing they bit unreliable if battery gets worn down . i usually check new batteries every time i am going out play some place serious . discount prices you find shops around web , only way beat price these tuners steal one !	-1
i've playing violin 20-plus years guitar least 10 years , so i guess you could say i'm fairly accomplished musician . musician , i say this guitar worth much more than its asking price . it looks great sounds even better , especially considering it costs so little buy ! i've owned several guitars this one sounds just good any other popular brands . it easy tune hold its tune just right . proportions nice , too , fits nicely my small hands . i'd recommend this anyone , especially anyone looking learn practice . black color looks great , too . way , i ordered this guitar june 5th it arrived me june 8th -- talk fast !	1
just clarify , this headphone amplifier not speaker . you must attach headphones ( supplied ) or your own amp/speakers . also , it comes either brown , green , or yellow random , meant clip your belt/pants . it not built like brick so don't step it . also , negative column , i found distortion sound unpleasant when i cranked it 11 . however , setting level halfway or 2/3 way up produced acceptable distorted sound . ( i don't lot experience other cheap amps , though , so danelectro might not worst thing out there . ) positive column , clean sound good , there no hum , only small amount hiss , reverb mild but pleasant . ( there no control over reverb level or speed , only on/off button . ) there plenty power drive supplied headphones " loud enough hurt your ears . ) grand total : 3 buttons ( power , distortion on/off , reverb on/off ); 2 dials ( volume control , distortion level ); 3 jacks ( guitar , headphone out , line out ); one led . bottom line : if you don't headphone practice amp already , getting one current low price no-brainer	-1
okay , it funky looks - but closest i came equivalent 2.5 times price lot less features . its hammy distortion echo actually fun replace couple external pedals unit connects easily simple instrument cables your guitar or bass guitar or keyboards or whatever . you practice peace quiet . but wait ! it comes mini-jack set headphones . i've got ipod loads headphones - these actually good set ( stereo ) headphones well worth price unit itself . it comes its own battery - no disappoint-ment giftee ! but other cool trick you hook it its " effects " back through instrument amp extra cable - how fun ? - very	1
first all , this good game . i only played two teams i am going say estimated time game play teams off . whenever i played , it took least three hours finish , less if we decided not finish . hardest part getting industry awards . game always ended both teams going their last award , so kept it close . . . which cool , but it main reason game takes so long . also , board design seemed make it so we would land " map " " music mix " more than any other space . most questions pretty hard , especially " 50 " . it one funniest moments during game when my opposing team relieved know they get britney spears question . relief turned into frustration when question asked one producers her album , it not one they knew . it awesome . overall it good game . it just takes while finish ( especially difficulty industry awards ) , i hate landing " 50 " square , it seems get like some bands more than others ( like band ) . buy it if you really know your music . casual listeners don't really help their teams much	-1
i used d'addario strings exclusively last 20 years . i tell you comparison they much louder fuller than ghs boomers same guage more reliable than whatever might come stock new guitar . there may other brands out there might give you more lifespan but comprimise tone . they tend get grungy after weekend gig , but if you change strings regularly i yet find string doesn't dissapoint compared d'addario ... plus you save empty packs send them cool stuff	1
i bought this mic online $150 new . i researched while decided this best option . i use canon gl2 this nice addition my rig.at first i didnt think audio all great , however , when i turned microphone attenuate feature my camera switched manual audio controls , i found this mic lot potential . attenuate , you really get clear audio without outside noise messing up your tracks . i pointed mic actor screen , then pointed mic away actor you could definetly here difference audio detail . note : mic two different posistions mount hot shoe mount , standard tripod mount , addition threaded hole which rode claimes microphone stand mount . my mic stand doesnt thread into this hole , i consider my mic stand pretty standard . however their may some adapters my local music store . not big issue consider , there plenty mounting options available	-1

i got this light before led lights started coming out retail channel . those lights tend almost too bright , but they advantage running ages tiny batteries . unfortunately , this light uses 4 aa batteries which makes it fairly hefty . it alternatively operate ac adapter . this makes it lighter , but it still bulky because battery compartmen t.t he good : light nicely bright natural quality that easy eyes . it ratcheting arm so you put it where you want it stays there ( better than most flexible arm ones)includes ac adapter slot ( though no ac adapter)can help weigh down lighter books keep pages turningnice large clamp attaching books . lamp shade which allows you throw light where you want without blinding your vision . decent quality plastic - made chinathe bad : no brightness adjustment . heavy ( benefit some cases ) makes holding up book all more tiring . bulky - makes it really hard book sit properly your hand . ratcheting mades loud click which wake your wife bed . :-) clip very limited strength seems slip easily . eats up batteries fairly quickly - i use rechargeables it now . i'm giving it even 2 because it pain use , really . hopefully i find light weight led clip-on which brightness adjustment quiet arm stays place most importantly - natural lighting . if so , i'll review it here - but most leds wash out page making it hard read . nice quality lamp only reason this one doesn't get 1.5 stars	-1

this trumpet extremely low quality , despite what any other review may say . most those reviews written non-musicians , likely parents who looking good deal . granted instrument playable , it seriously constrict development player . this instrument most likely china , which recent years sent out thousands low quality instruments cheap prices . check out ebay , theres always hundreds these trumpets under various names such laval , bessler , weimer . just remember , you get what you pay . although even used name-brand student trumpets may cost more , they much better quality last lifetime . stick name brands like bach , yamaha , conn , selmer , king , kanstul , etc . if you any doubts , give it quick search google	-1
i saw lot bad review this crappy item , but like silly guy i bought it ! aware it may nonreturnable item . if you me , don't spend your money this pick ! buy real chorus gear	-1
this some pretty firewood . it not stay tune , nor it play real guitar . this strictly toy should not purchased if you want your child start learning how play . i really dissappointed when i got it out its box	-1
this guitar shockingly bad- cheaply made broke withing one minute my tiny two year old touching it , bridge fell off , strings snapped when we tried tune it . extra string ( yes , that singular ) didn't even fit ! don't waste your money	-1
i'm guitar player decided pick up drums second instrument , also help developing better sense rhythm . course my studies , i happened across dd-20c , it seemed offer some really nice features what seemed like reasonable price . unit itself 10 preassigned drum kits , plus ability assign your own custom setup . addition , it offers 16 special effects , 4 drum roll effects , adjustable tempo , 100 different styles play which cover wide range genres . not only , but it offers package very intuitive interface get even rank beginner up going quickly . sounds like pretty nice deal , right ? it would ... if it worked like it supposed . actually i'm my second set right now , this one go back refund . first set i pads so insensitive make unit nearly unplayable . what i mean this there maybe square inch or so sweet spot where pads would sound all , even then i really strike hard . second set i'm now far better response than first , but still falls short acceptable . starters , pads don't feel like real drum skin all . if one compare against acoustic snare drum example , snare certain " bounce " it this unit doesn't . basically pads absorb most impact , this turn makes doing any kind fast work or rudiments all but impossible . also , even though my second set more responsive first , i found it still takes considerable amount force comparison real drum get pads sound off . keep mind pads themselves only 4 inches or so diameter ... actual snare starts 12 " . all fairness though , i really can't hold pad size alone against dd-20 yamaha keep overall size cost manageable , reality if there weren't feel responsiveness issue , pad size should sufficient . however , when these combined factors taken into consideration , i found it makes frustrating experience . my opinion what it worth , new drummers who looking dd-20 learn should it old-school way , start quality practice pad instead . they considerably less expensive ( reelfeel 12 " pad sticks run half what this unit costs ) , indestructible , easier work , offer least reasonable approximation feel real drum . not only , but pad also inherently allows quiet practice . maybe yamaha fix feel sensitivity problems next revision this drum set ... then it might worth it . until then , i feel dd-20c best avoided .	-1
videos amazing ! i would say better than amazing . riffs , solos taught fun work well level they correspond , i feel progresses well beginner beyond consistant speed . only problem ... there grey area overlaps term beginner intermediate so you may skip around lessons get track course . instance i decided learn riffs practice pull offs beginner dvds go straight into intermediate levels course beginner sections where way easy . but i would say if powerful riffs electrifying solos your passion then i know no other course get you there quicker while more fun doing it	1

i bought grados thinking i going experience heavenly sound , but not case . i pretty disappointed when i first heard them because me , it wasnt much different sounding than my sennheiser hd202s panasonic earphones . ( note : i am not audiophile am just " average joe " terms deciphering sound ) but after week or so , i am starting appreciate them . they much more comfortable than my hd202s ( i wear glasses hd202s hurt my ears so much ) definitely sound better . but , if u ask me if they sound $69 dollars better than my hd202s , i would say no ! i am still trying search " heavenly " sound or mind blowing experience headphones so if anyone any recommendations , please post them your revie	1

microphone cord very good quality . stand solid easy adjust . note xlr cord connector . adapter needed 1/4 connection	1
every gigging musician knows when something petty mic clip gets broken , it more than little annoying . i this my spare think it works just fine	1
sound quality nice rather than harsh like some metronomes . it 2 sound levels built ; adjustments side . one louder than other which softer , sweeter quality . i practice my mute or off change volume accordingly . using metronome : all my violin students ( children adults ) begin number 60 dial . if time signature says 4/4 , each quarter note receives one beat there 4 beats per measure . they practice scales , exercises all songs 60 begin . once they master everything 60 they move dial higher number . following numbers 63 , 66 , 69 , 72 , 76 , 80 , etc . ( all way 208 this metronome ) their goal play 80 no mistakes . many students play well numbers higher than 80 .	1
usually metronome used musical purposes , but i actually purchased it karate training . i hundred kicks each leg per type kick i use beat metronome keep me going my desired pace . also , i boost pace keep track my improvement . i know , bit odd , but it really job what i wanted it .	1

i this microphone almost 3 years now , it still works well . shock mounting broken , but actual microphone unit still going strong . i am definitely not expert music but i like sound . i find highs little extreme sometimes bordering harsh this microphone . i realise terms like ' muddy ' somewhat open interpretation but i no qualms clarity midtones recording solo vocals or acoustic instruments . noted previous reviews , this microphone requires phantom power . i'm running it through my alto s-6 mixing desk.at this price it definitely picking up one these microphones , i'm very happy chosen it my first compressor mic , but now ( after almost 3 years ) i think i should upgrade	1

lee oskar sounds good , feels good , it repairable . they really last long time . i bought different brand i one reeds break within month or so	1

i checked out these little $15.00 pedals out guitar center surprisingly impressed . they're very quiet sound great . someone who wants explore effect processing , these great start . same goes if you just expanding your pedalboard like myself . only cons you can't see setting knob top ( but it give you experience trusting your ears not your eyes create right effects ) footswitch difficult trigger if box sitting behind pedal . review whining not getting battery pedal ... wwwaahhh wwaahh wwaahh !!!! buy adaptor !! these great little pedals price !	1
i loved my grado sr60 when i chance buy used grado sr80 i so . i can't tell huge difference two . i keep one my bed listen beethoven quartets late night . separation instruments lovely . quality wonderful - very smooth lifelike . i can't imagine better set headphones . there clear difference these my cheap earbuds - although i lie my side my head pillow earbuds these i stay my back . other set grado i keep my rowing machine . set i listen loud rock roll or traditional irish music . it never gets harsh i turn up volume it sounds great . there more expensive cans out there but i doubt improvement would justify higher price	1
after hearing all great reviews this product i very dissappointed when i first plugged these phones . bass very flat phones not very clear . other reviewers mentioned break period so i decided leave phones running my cd jutebox 30 hours . wow !, what difference sound . it like night day sound quality . sound truely amazing . bass very good phones very clear . grado needs state this breakin period box or manual because some people may decide return phones not realizing there breakin period	1

i almansa 435 seniorita , which very lovely little classical guitar , so i some idea what decent classical guitar should sound like . i got this little one my son , who 5 , didnt want spend much because you know how children when it comes lessons instruments . i very surprised quality sound . it still it breaking period , so strings still stretching , but it sounds really , really , nice . i even played it myself ( you know , just get it warmed up my son ! ) it truly not bad . doesnt sound " tinny " or " toyish " . sounds like classical guitar . now i bought much more expensive one few years ago my daughter , who since given up guitar , handmade mexico , solid wood , 3/4 size , didn't sound nearly good this little thing . this price , you get solid spruce top , finish nice , kind matted , tuners pretty good , so far strings aren't too bad . base strings look like they could silver-plated . unfortunately you dont get any product information box so who knows where strings came what kind they ( guitar romanian ) , but main thing guitar sounds so nice child encouraged continue , teacher pleased , parents not suffer more than usual beginning-any-instrument " noises " , perhaps lot less because it such pleasant sound . now course it isnt comparable almansa or finer guitars , but young child who serious wanting study classical guitar , this very fine instrument excellent price . this model sold other sites 20 dollars more , but why pay ?! if you looking small guitar your young child , this one very good bet . real , very decent sounding , classical guitar price toy one	1

i like sound i get mic it very good valuue money prosumer cam owners , but consumer-level camera owners should beware . i bought this mic found it way too sensitive/hot consumer cameras like panasonic gs200 which no audio input level control . it picks up too much background noise overwhelms camera automatic gain controller when things get loud . i'm not sure if gs200 mic attenuation setting or if turning it would sufficient answer . i put cheap radio shack in-line volume controller mic camera ( which introduce crackle if you adjust it while recording ) . prosumer cams input level control like canon gl2 it works fine , even without turning mic attenuation . if you camcorder input level controls i might get this . important caveat : you cannot run this mic through 1/8 " connection beachtek mixer box . you'll hear nothing beachtek output because impedance mismatch . i don't know if putting xlr adapter mic cable would work	1

well , me it curious thing . jellifish changes lot texture pluck when you strum or arpeggios but it little fragile . i like it so i play it lot time since i bought it but i strong strumming stile so tires , largest ones , breaking root . this not flaw jellifish , they very clear produce sounds they say it better it light strum picking . it just i get emotional when i play , jajaja . i also founded way use it physical cello bow . note this pick textures cause it not produces effect like pedal . it smart product could bring some new life your playing , but only if you're open minded don't expect pick neither pedal effect kind sound . i only want i always new one available , they 6 month lifetime i read somewhere jellifish page .	1

i found many same things true previous reviewer . if you want brighter elixir , they also make nanoweb versions lighter coating . they wear out quicker though . before i started using elixirs , my favorite strings ' addario 80/20 phosphor bronze . i could get 3 sets price 1 set elixirs . i really found elixir price bit shock , but used them few months . whim , i went back other strings . i never noticed how quickly they oxidized went dead before ! i've gone back stayed elixir . i've also tried ' addario exp dean markley alchemy coated strings . they okay , but i found elixirs looked sounded better longer . downsides ? uncoated strings show wear spots oxidize long before coated ones . also , coating wears off , i've found strings get " fuzzy . " overall , i still end up changing stings lot less than i used . one star deducted high price .	1
