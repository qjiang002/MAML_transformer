i saw jonathan qvc really impressed claim moisturizing conditioner great dry/damaged hair . he also said his products don't strip color out hair like some brands market . i color highlight my hair wanted something would protect it . what disapointment . conditioner bottle horrible dispensing even small amount conditioner . i remove lid . then , it like paste ... doesn't seem go through hair .. even after 3 minutes . when i tried comb my hair out , it like birds nest . i put spray leave conditioner , line , my hair just comb through it . i ordered it qvc ... it going back	-1
scale 1 5 , packaging gets negative 1 . you can't sqeeze conditioner out bottle , ended up removing top . value product , jonathan gets 1 . quality product 3 . conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter . need use more than average . conditioner average detangling after using it four times it condition your hair , but no better than other quality brands . i like it seems cut down drying time , but bed head similar product that out while . option i would rather choose bed head quality price	-1

watching show i thought jonathan really cared hair its no doubt he still but his shampoo leaves alot desired . example , even hot , very humid atmosphere houston , tx it left my hair feeling dry unhealthy , even after using his conditioner ( alot it ) . my hair looks awful after using it . bottle claims it doesn't use toxic ingredients like mea but it use three different types peg , petroleum based thicker found most bath products erode wooden tables just minutes . this just harmful mea , especially people sensitive scalps hair . it claims not strip your hair but products supposed cleanse much less apparent product than peg products . since peg thickener , you're also getting diluted , toxic , solution . even though head shoulders uses mea i find even works better than this . my hair doesn't feel like it any more its essential oils i've switched back other hair products iv'e using . it not worth your 20 dollars , its barely worth 5 dollars . my hair stylist also recommended dove products if you need hydration . don't buy it !	-1

i'm sure this hair dryer exceptional quality - perhaps worth price some . but i'd careful buying something uses fake science babble try convince you its effectiveness . " most ionic infrared " gibberish . tourmaline , gemstone , electrical properties ( when squeezed or heated , it develops charge across crystal ) , but nothing hair drying , or ionizing air , or anything else . i'd recommend buying less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead falling pseudoscientific scam	-1

actually , i would give product 5 stars , packaging minus-2 . citylips really work , plumping hydrating ; it required repeated applications . but packaging results 10-12% ( expensive ) material completely unavailable ! worse , if you try wiggle ( too-short ) applicator order get last 10% , container breaks neck ( actually , one came already cracked my case ! ) . true , they offer some colors 2/3 price , but most effective apply clear , go outside lipline-and clear almost never gone sale !	-1

my sister-in-law bought this product me after i admired shade ( purr , light baby pink color ) she wearing . i used other mac products before great results , but very dissapointed this product . first all , i gave this product one star because shade look very pretty lips went very well my skin coloring . however , this product sticky . very sticky ! it not matter whether you apply lot or very little , you still wind up this horrible heavy feeling your lips . not only it sticky , but just down right uncomfortable . when i wear lip gloss , i want soft smooth feeling . i want able rub my lips together without them getting stuck together ' dragging ' so speak . also , because this gloss ' consistancy , it tendency clump together your lips form line ' gunk ' both upper lower lip where two meet rest together when you your moth closed . this start happen only 15 minnutes after application . very embarassing when you talking some hot guy then look mirror afterwards discover you gross lines your lips !!!! this product seems popular other viewers , however , i would never reccomend this anyone	-1
i purchased entire 3-step clinique system including : clinique facial soap dishclinique clarifying lotion 2clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotionabout same time i started using clinique 3-step system , i began wearing foundation first time . i found my skin started breaking out began dry some spots . i stopped using foundation after 3 months because i thought issue . however , my skin problems not improve i even moved down level clinique system one more sensitive skin . however , after 7 months daily use , my skin not improving i found review clinique 3-step system paula begoun . her research indicates all clinique facial soaps 3-step system too irritating all skin types . her research also stated all clarifying lotions ( 1-4 ) contain alcohol clarifying lotion 2 contains menthol which make them too irritating all skin types . i never thought my skin care products cause my flaky skin break outs . apparently , products dried out my skin making it flaky some areas response , my skin started producing more oil compensate dryness-which made me break out other areas . i switched paula choice facial products i occasionally use cetaphil . after i made switch , my skin slowly began recovering . unfortunately , now i some acne scars my cheeks result using clinique 3-step system . it makes me sad because before , my skin healthy most part clear . i want fair clinique . they some great products --- i use their city block sheer spf 15 , advanced stop signs eye spf 15 i wear clinique happy perfume which smells amazing . i hope this review proves helpful other women so you don't go through what i went through ! clinique some great products their line , but they need reformulate their 3-step skin care system .	-1
i love smell this perfume . however , it doesn't stay . i wearing perfume 18 years now used several different kinds without problem . i sold sjp this perfume when she appeared oprah . loved it when i went counter mall check it out . i using it 2 months now it just doesn't last . hour after i put it i ( or my husband ) can't smell it anymore . trust me , i learned apply it liberally it still doesn't stay . totally disappointed	-1
i'm huge fan majority philosophy line , adoring amazing grace scent ! i thought this scrub would perfect spring into summer period because light floral scent . boy i wrong !! if you love amazing grace , this smells nothing like it . it smells like plastic flowers .. not appealing all . even my fiance made comment bathroom smelled like melting plastic . if you want fantastic exfoliator , try gingerbread man or margarita scrub .. those devine ! i think i'll stick my amazing grace body lotion now	-1
this one cutest shower caps i've owned , but it didn't keep my hair dry -- cap kept sliding up my head . sephora shower cap also same thing , but , least , it only cost $5 . so far , i've found best shower caps complimentary ones i receive when i occasionally stay hotel .	-1
i bought this stuff shopping channel , thought it wasn't bad , until i went get my hair colored . color didn't take ! my hair shoulder length , i only used ojon bottom 5 or 6 inches , because that part dry . color only took ' new growth ' , not rest my hair - hair i put ojon ! smell oil , shampoo , or conditioner didn't bother me , but hair spray disgusting . people remarked i overdosed perfume , so i wash it again get rotten smell out my hair . i definitely wouldn't recommend this anyone who colors their hair .	-1

i using this product month all it given me puffy eyes . there no proof this product works all fda even written makers this product warning letter stop making false claims it helps stretch marks wrinkles . i've used botox before believe me , botox works , this product doesn't , so obviously it not better than botox . i bet people who gave it 5 stars either work company or fictional entities created basic research marketing department so product seems better than it actually	-1

there much better products lush . i got free sample this conditioner used it lush trichomania solid shampoo . first i really liked it , but throughout day , my hair felt like it getting oilier . i'm not sure if it trichomania or coolaulin , but i gave both away my friend who likes coconut . smell wasn't my favorite either ( i'm not coconut person ) , but if you like coconut , you love shampoo conditioner . me , i stick american cream rehab . ** update**december 21 , 2005i tried coolaulin conditioner again , my hair didn't get oily all . i'm not sure what happened first time i tried it , but it fine this time around . i'm not coconut person , so this conditioner still not my fave ( american cream !! ) , but i want add two stars make rating *~* four stars *~* because conditioner made my hair really soft	-1
i quickly realized while shower i don't want smell like margarita all day . it lather well i don't find smell overpowering but it not special . warning those us chemically treat our hair , this product shampoo very drying strips color out hair .	-1
any manufacturer doesn't fully label their product should not trusted . i not see list ingredients here ( but most nail polishes don't bother this anyway ) . problem i see this ... this nail polish totes it safe use during pregnancy due fact it doesn't contain above ingredients , but what it contain instead ? if it wears well , doesn't peel , give good color coverage , it got contain something offending ingredient place , logically . please ask yourself this before you sigh relief add basket ! phthalates , example , class industrial plasticizers invented 1930s . they often used nail polish because they make nail polish flexible , they used other products because they help bleed chemicals fragrances help lotion better penetrate skin . they aren't required labeled products . lab animals given dibutyl phthalate higher numbers offspring birth defects , especially male reproductive system . nail polish may not contain phthalates ( brag it ) , but may contain related plasticizer essentially just harmful . this contain phthalic anhydride , toxic chemical hardener ? how fdc color , such yellow 5 ? it petroleum-based color also questionable when it comes safety . basically put , no nail polish safe during pregnancy . top , while your it you should review every lotion , foundation product , etc you use if you're concerned things like this . i think it great careful - more power you - but fully informed , not partially . companies prey our worst fears , what worse than harming our babies ? if this product so great , let see ingredients list ( all cosmetics should same , while i'm sounding off subject ! )	-1

i'm going europe thought this would save me time mornings ( maybe nerves , since i'm traveling two women no doubt towels short supply ! ) . but this thing hard use , instructions poorly drawn , apparently i head giant - button button latch ( which isn't easy find isn't identified directions ) don't stay together due my ginormous noggin . reason i chose this specific product try because it pink would clearly different regular hotel towels because cute tube case - i thought it would pack easily . material itself seems work ( she says it slides , yet again , down her forehead cover her eyes ) . after twenty minutes wrestling this cuddly little critter , i concede . similar items may work , just not this one	-1
huge fan pink sugar avid chocolate fanatic , i ecstatic try out chocolovers . since they don't sell chocolovers anywhere near where i live i decided order it sephora.com us . first all i thought price fairly reasonable 1.7 oz bottle ( very nice bottle package , if i might add ) , it cost me around $50 cdn . i so excited when my order came today i quickly opened up bottle gave it sniff . ahhh sickeningly sweet smell disappointment . i don't know what i expecting , maybe something more like milk chocolate , but what i got strong citrus/cocoa powder burst fading into very strong sweet smell almost like turkish delights or raspberries chocolate hint musk . this may sound good , but much fan sweet candy/foody smells i am , i found this one too overpowering it seriously made me sick . right now all i smell sickly sweetness smell flat seven up . plus side it stopped completely my cravings sweets . i think if i trying diet i would wear this scent everyday . i think i keep it hopes it grow me because i really love look bottle box it came . i am also going try layer it cocoa body lotion hopes it tame down some sweetness . bottom line try before you buy	-1

dermablend leg body cover reminds me alot mud . you know how you get mud your shoes it dark first but then dries look alot lighter flakes off ? that very accurate comparison this product . it sets very chalky , dry , finish which appears flaky pasty , corpse like gray tinge it . it creepy looking ! even all colors available it still looks unnatural ashy when dry . only way i able use it cover my tattoo product then disguise hideously fake makeup under pair thick , shimmery dance tights !! you couldn't pull it off just makeup your bare skin though . it would great if you want dress up like mummy or decaying corpse halloween though	-1

after reading great reviews votivo candles i decided spend rediculous sum $24 moroccan spice candle . when i received candle i smelled sweet spice coming it even before i opened packaging . readying myself rocket rich fragrance immersing my room exotic spice i hopefully lit candle . after hour candle lit i came into my room it scented only 3 feet around candle . dissapointed , perhaps prove there absolutely no way i didn't get jacked this purchase i lit it again-this time 3 hours . there still no smell . compare this $6 ' tea ' candles i bought gold canyon candle co . which when i lit 6 them richly scented not only my room ( which 13 ' 13 ' ) but hallway , well my mothers room next door ( 16 ' 16')!if your thinking maybe $22+ dollars would worth it exotic fragrances-think again there nothing special scent you couldn't get grocery store . jipped-you bet	-1
this product no better than any regular washcloth and/or headband hold your hair back . save your money	-1
this product didn't work me , described . first all , it smell nice , which different usual fumes nail polishes give off ! smells lemony ! its also easy use - you brush it over nails surrounding area , let it set awhile until it gets dull then gently buff it off tissue . all fine dandy , but it didn't leave my nails all dry , nor it leave them shiny . fact , they less shiny than shiny topcoats i use . i also worse case bedsheet wrinkles embedded my manicure night after using this product - could unrelated , but i've never seen so many creases smudges my nails when i woke up i let them dry few hours after painting them ! i wouldn't recommend this product .	-1

this product such waste . little granules made mess when used styling agent blow-drying hair . i not repurchase it .	-1
falling love one my favorite scents ever . it basically my go-to fragrance everyday . if you're fan this scent you already know it really pretty but very light . that why i exited solid touch-ups go . let me tell you , subtle understatement this product . when i opened seal held it under my nose i could hardly smell it . when i applied it ( generously ) my wrist scent barely detectable . i rubbed my wrists together gently warm perfume it didn't help all . i expected this fairly concentrated so little dabs would suffice . very disappointing .	-1
i looking forward lovely lavender scent when i got this soap , but sadly , that not what happened . smell very strong herbal ; like kind you would add italian pasta dish . not very appealing ! there some complexity scent , but it so overshadowed herb smell really come through . plus side , color beautiful ( rich , dark purple ) lather equally lovely look . if you like true herbal scents , then you should give this try . it just wasn't me .	-1
" happy " really good smell but unfortinately its all gone after 5 mins . it like cheap colognes .	-1

i am black american combination hair ... nappy , wavy straight . i've using drug store relaxers over 30 years ( cr�me nature , tcb , dark lovely , revlon realistic ) whatever " sale " satisfying results . these products leave my hair evenly straight shiny but hard stiff immediately after process . i usually wash my hair after few days ( i like give it rest after relaxing ) use good conditioner soften detangle . there i am able go 12 weeks before retouch . general my hair healthy responds well straightners . my biggest expense conditioning products maintain my hair . i'll try anything spend any amount if it works well my hair . i great success frederic fekkai products love phytodefrisant botanical hair relaxing balm ... this stuff amazing if you like wash go ( air dry ) it works wonders blow drying/flat ironing too . ( bumble bumble styling spray amazing product great flat ironing results . ) i forked out $60 try phtyo2 after reading all rave reviews . i am satisfied outcome but not blown away . yes , phyto2 not smell bad , it not burn my scalp it straighten my hair but no better than dark lovely or tcb , my hair still hard stiff afterward . it several weeks my hair doing great , but again no different when i use dark lovely . i guess i am lucky my hair responds well any type relaxer so i doubt i'll spending $60 phyto2 ... i'd rather buy two tubes phytodefrisant balm continue my $7.99 drug store brands . i hope this helps someone similar hair mine . if you well drug store brands , phyto results not different ... spend money their other products nourish condition your hair	-1

i generally love lush soaps , but not recommend this one . demon dark great name , but it doesn't smell very good ( sort faint , slightly minty scent ) . it also black wax coating rather difficult peel or scrape off , but must removed soap work properly . i would try red rooster or karma soap instead	-1
i thought product arrived timely manner . instructions clear , but it hard hold stencils put your eyebrow same time . not bad product price	-1

i just got this item ( ebay , it cheaper)and feel it worthy praise . i thick , straight hair , bought this product wave my hair . i haven't figured out how it curls , but wave it incredibly easy ! grab your hair root twist outward it waves nice fast w/o burning your hair like curling iron would . also w/ curling iron , it difficult wave top close roots . it heats fast ! comes w/ nice pouch so you put it away before it cools .	1
high beam provides glow or sheen , where my cheeks seem dull . it not look greasy ... i would say it makes skin look healthy vibrant	1
i am big fan this product . my hair very strong . it needs product which keep it tamed . however , most products level strength also come high sheen or gloss which , my opinion , bad look today fashions . matte look more flexible . american crew fiber gives me pliability matte look very strong hold . it also smells nice .... not strong not too girly	1
this stuff great . i used buy new gels , pommades , pastes , etc . every month because i could never find one worked exactly how i wanted it . but i first tried this year ago it all i've used since . it lasts long time , so don't afraid price . one container lasts me 6 months , so you only buy it twice year . i'll ordering my third order it soon	1

( very good one ! )	1
i don't know what complaints this product . it seems people trying use it extreme hold hairstyles . this not purpose this product . i use it my short haircut make ends stay spiky styled out , it works wonderfully . no matter how much you move your head , it stays place , but somehow moves enough keep you stiff look . , when you brush your hair out end day , it feels like you never put it . hair stays soft feels clean . reason why this gel thinner it isn't sticky or goopey your hair other gels . it spreads out easier	1
i never wanted waste my money manicure , because my polish would chipping/peeling next day . my pedicurist bet me she could keep polish my manicure using this stuff , low behold ... it worked ! it kept polish week even through housecleaning trip vegas	1
still life bath bomb contains pretty sunflower petals make this summery bath experience . truthful , after putting this bath i walked away came back into room , wondering who eating fruit loops ! scent this " fun take bath before breakfast " experience . fresh scent lemon sweet wild orange mingles bergamot gardenia extract . result this bath refreshing - i face day feeling . if you want enhance experience , try happy hippy shower gel grapefruit . i love juicy shampoo veganese conditioner also complete citrus experience . if you think petals this bath bombs fun ( ones my bath slipped right down drain ) , wait until you try big blue experience seaweed . it take adventurous spirit try some these items , but official lush addict , i tend dive into experiences abandon . you may also love golden slumbers ( lavender neroli ) , sex bomb ( jasmine , ylang ylang , clary sage ) , romance stone ( wild orange , mandarin tangarine ) . onward try tisty toasty which i hear bit love spell style bath rose petals . ~ rebecca review	1

i love idea this all natural mascara + organic ingredients but nothing artifical or chemicals !! this tipe mascara which lengthens lashes not volumises it ( i think dr. hauschka doesn't make kind ) . when it time wash it off it comes off very easy ( spares your lashes ) . unfortunately i couldn't change my 4 star recommendation 2 ... this follow up my previous review . when i'd using this mascara 2 weeks i noticed it started flake except some reason flakes ended up my eyes , not my cheek or under my eyes . first i didn't know it mascara .. i thought something went into my eyes but every single time i applied , it happened . not straight away .. but 2-3 hours later .. this very frustrating ... i tried put less this product my lashes but then i looked like i nothing . this point i still some flaking , not bad before , but it still enough hurt my eyes .. so i just stopped using this product all together . only reason why i'd give 2 stars this product instead 1 because it natural organic ... i appriciate fact . but that it . i really wanted like this product so i am very disappointed , it wasn't cheap either . dr. hauschka need improve quality this product	-1
this only blemish treatment i ever tried get rid anything . ive using it 8 years it never let me down . you use it spot treatment or if you area clogged pores your nose you put little every night help clear those up . it isnt meant go places your face where you no acne or blemishes though . it strong cause little peeling if you put it your entire face . it little pricey , but size this container probably last you close year	1
this my first badger brush , i don't know how competent reviewer i , but i am really happy it . it large enough hold lot foam ( sometimes i fell like it actually holds too much ) . it fairly heavy robust , which i also like . i've using it 6 months now , feeling it going last years . make sure hang it dry wash it thoroughly after each use . anybody who new wonderful world shaving brush , i highly recommend this page intro : [ ... ]	1
i can't even begin explain how much i love this product . although teen age acne long gone me , like most women certain time month , i get little flair up here there . this product great . totally takes red out i say speeds healing process well . i found it it made them disappear over night if i dabbed it there few times day esp when i saw begingings one . ones i caught early never really turned into full blown acne . yes it pricey but i think it worth every penny .	1

i know it sounds cliche , but i literally tried every acne product both over counter prescription . such products include ( but not limited ) proactiv , exposed skin care , differin , accutane , neutrogena products , clean clear , etc . i never results like this . i previously tried murad acne complex found it little too harsh my red , irritated , sensitive skin . i currently switched sensitive line murad acne complex which consists this cleanser , moisturizing acne treatment gel cellular replenishing serum . i found my cistic acne gone , blotchiness reduced number whiteheads drastically reduced . my skin never looked so smooth all my pre-teen young adult life i only using this particular line 4 days ! addition sensitive acne complex , i would also recommend getting clarifying toner . remember , little goes long way these products !	1

this excellent product but i problem disguising white look it leaves my face . first i thought it because i used too much , but even when i use only tiny amount it still white . it certainly suit persons pale complexions . wish there tint it	-1
i absolutely fell love this fragrance . it smells like day county fair , absolutely lovely . you layer it though make it last .. wash shower gel , put body lotion first thing when you get out shower or bath , ( perfumes " stick " better way , while you're " moist " ) , then spray . if you wash your hair , spray while your blow-drying it out . carry spray your purse , you need " touch up " during day	1

i used many , many products cheapest drugstore ones high end department store stuff kinerase cream truly one best overall skin improvement . i am big fan minimal redness irritation this cream delivers spades . leaves my skin beautifully soft , super smooth all without added perfume ( who going smell your face ? ) additives . i also used lotion version which contains retinyl palmitate , but i much prefer this cream which adds more moisture doesn't contain any retinoids which cause irritation . isn't whole premise purpose kinerase anyway ? great stuff	1
if you dry skin your hands these gloves very nice . i place mine microwave 15 seconds while i apply moisturizer my hands . slide gloves onto your hands soon microwave finished . 15 minutes you quick , but effective moisturizing treatment . if your hands really dry you could same thing but leave them overnight . i found overnight option little warm my hands . but , it might work fine you . these socks 94% cotton 6% spandex . they machine washed tumbled dried . i not found it necessary launder them each time i use them . i use light moisturizer ( cetaphil ) , so you might different experience if you use heavier product moisturize . i would highly recommend this product .	1

anyone who gave this lotion low rating simply so because they don't realize achieving great curly hair process . there no one product all work . i thick , frizzy , damaged , curly hair . i use this lotion after using my favorite shine serum , then after letting air dry few minutes finish gel or mousse hold . curl enhancing lotion really really improves look my curls - uneven ringlets loose waves , almost universal loose big curl - it beautiful ! only downside tiny bottle such high price . it should least 8oz	-1

this perfect winter cream me , would probably work anyone else who very dry skin ( e.g. , you rub eucerin night ) . it very similar regular cream appearance ( pink ) smell ( not offensive ) , but it much heavier . i started using this during winter when i discovered regular cream wasn't heavy enough it works just well . it spreads pretty easily such thick cream when i wake up my skin dewy moisturized .	1
i absolutely love smell philosophy cinnamon buns . like other reviewers said , it doesn't last long after shower but it nice way wake up morning . even my husband likes it he really picky anything scented . i only use it shower gel not shampoo so it lasts pretty long making it worth expense . i like other cinnamon buns products also - i use cream lip gloss	1
i mixed feelings philosophy products . one thing they really number my skin far drying certain areas my skin out . other hand , i use very congested skin nose area but i noticed huge difference congestion my skin when using when hope not enough serum . i haven't noticed any lifting but line my eyebrows softened . far reducing facial hair growth don't count it . i am only giving this 4 stars because even though it helped keep my congestion under control , it hasn't much more than i think it bit pricy just exfoliator	-1

lush makes few products lemon , but i think this one best because it coconut oil deep conditioning it little intoxicating scent vetivert . earthy fragrance may appeal your wilder side if you enjoy jungle conditioner which also contains vetivert oil . use this conditioner after daddy-o shampoo all you imagine you walking through fields lavender drinking coconut milkshake . i also recommend honey trap lip balm smitten hand cream . " all jas " also wonderful product bath . ~ rebecca review	1

much better terms coverage than new loreal makeup diane keaton touts , which more creamy but just doesn't cover well . avon mousse foundation goes almost like powder but doesn't block my pores . i highly recommend it	1
covers great ( i read splotches ) good my skin . cannot recommend it highly enough	1
i bought this because i wanted primer make up , but acne prone skin felt most other primers would make me break out , some reviews stated . initially i break out little , but i kept using it becuase rest my skin looked so great felt so smooth . after week breakouts went away ( they minor ) all i say wow . my skin looks so much better , my make up looks better , i look better without make up , etc . etc . i use it complete me powder foundation i never all my 38 years happier pair products .	1
i am highly sceptical myself when it comes skincare products . i received this gift after trying mask magnaminty ( also good ) . i blown away how this product made my skin feel . i used every product under sun am regular proactiv customer . this scrub great my oily skin left it feeling really clean soft . i am totally hooked ! you love it too ... totally worth money	1

i used philosophy products over year now am proponent their exfoliators cleansers . i enthusiastically bought present after seeing it new product nordstrom counter . bottle says it clear makeup fine lines , wrinkles , uneven texture . it used three different ways ; alone oil-free moisturizer sensitive skin ; over oil free moisturizer ( such hope jar ) create illusion airbrushed skin ; under foundation smooth finish . i after airbrushed skin , this product works great if used over moisturizer . it truly minimize pores fine lines . if you don't like wear lot makeup , it gives you very fresh natural look . unfortunately , no matter how diligent your , sometimes blemishes pop up you use foundation . present not suitable this function me . used under my foundation , my makeup felt cakey , thick , foundation not blend well into this product . it left unsightly foundation streaks difficult correct . i could not hold my mac foundation responsible , because used alone it not exhibit any these qualities . i would highly reccomend this product " clear makeup " but not foundation primer indicated back bottle . if you looking foundation primer , i would reccomend smashbox photo finish . it extremely lightweight , blends well foundation , bottle last forever because you use such small amounts .	-1
great towel gym or after swimming . very absorbant i also use one cover circuit machines when i use them	1
spearmint top note , lemon middle , clean bottom . patrick wore this ( yes , it great manly men too ) when we ran half marathon last week my nose followed him all way finish line . truly unusual pleasurable scent . it green , but not obvious chypre leafy modern sense like chanel crystalle . nope , this mint like julep . i've never biggest guerlain fan--i've left shalimar-isms my grandmother , who ravissante those old fashioned orientals ... but guerlain splendid aqua allegoria line -- which includes herba fresca equally divine pamplelune ( grapefruit chamomile burst ) , among others -- truly fresh . i get lots compliments when i wear herba fresca	1

this one my favorites . i love scent . it doesn't smell like fresh strawberries because it not supposed . it supposed smell like strawberry milkshake ( i think they good job it - so this what i expected ) . philosophy good job matching scent name . only thing i didn't expect i still need condition conditioner . i'd say it shampoo shower gel , 2-in-1 , not 3-in-1	-1

i suffered rosacia past nine years . i fairly young starting through change life , i no idea what causing my complexion problems . not understanding ( or expecting)what happening my skin , i made many many mistakes during first year or so , trying remedy symptoms countless products formulated more adult acne or aging tired skin , bad idea . if you rosacea or very sensitive skin , you know sometimes it seems all you need touch your skin wrong way you break out , let alone slathering some chemically based , perfumed , or exfoliating ( ground pits like ) product your face . this becomes especially discouraging when you also beginning see normal signs aging but sensitivities won't allow you take advantage some great treatments out there nourish your skin stay step ahead wrinkles , not mention feeling starved moisture which real key younger , healthy looking skin . after awhile i afraid try anything else , so i just stopped . i washed my face gently left it . well it only got worse i felt like dried up prune . enter philosophy hope jar dry sensitive skin . it if this product made just me . now instead people asking me " what wrong your face ? " they ask , " what type skincare you use ? " since i've using philosophy skin care line , i find i guite often feel comfortable going out without makeup , something i rarely since my twenties . since sun protection so important , philosophy offers product called , when hope not enough spf 20 daytime which comes bottle , but i found my skin responds much better hope jar-dry sensitive formula , then followed philosophy seperate sunsreen called shelter-spf 15 . this because " shelter " not contain vitamin or peptides slightly lower concentration sunscreens , contrary spf-20 moisurizer combo . you may able get combination product save few bucks , but aforementioned ingredients it not agree my sensitivities , especially vitamin . much needed exfoliation dilemma , try philosophy , micro-delivery peel pads or their " peel kit " both soothing non-abrasive . hope this helps enjoy your new skin !	1

most waterproof mascaras designed come off oil-based remover . stupid idea ; our skin oil it . after couple hours we end up " racoon " eyes .

i'm giving this product 4 stars how well this pencil blends any brow color .... i would think people who use like define brows pencil , this perfect neutral color . i subtracted one star because iprefer apply brow definers brow powder brush . i think it looks more natural .. brenda christian makes brow powder which i prefer over pencils but color this pencil far superior any powderi find . sometimes i mix two . i start pencil add bit powder . all all , it color this pencil superior all other eyebrow pencils	-1

i decided try it out found only soap i want use . fragrance great , it not overpower . i guess milling process gives soap it texture which removes need all those bath/shower accessories . 1 bar lasted over 2 months . i definitely ordering more trying other products this vendor carries	1
benefit claims this all you want wear , i am starting think this might true ... first , i say texture intriguing . it balm , but it feels much more velvety , slight shimmer gives you sheen . second , i am sucker packaging presentation . it comes little tin box , signature bathina ( very retro chic ) black powder puff pink ribbon holder . it makes you want apply product public , just excuse show off set . also , it ups feminity factor applying product little puff ( very " i adore girl ... " ) then , there scent . it floral , sexy fragrance doesn't overpower . it clean big plus it doesn't make me sneeze , like some other scents . i think little goes long way , thus , i say even though it " boutique-brand " product , it very affordable . i think warmer weather sets , you want show off little more skin , this product would enhance tan .	1

know you . you me . looking what seemed simple thing - scented candle actually smells up room when you light it . you've bought cheap ones grocery store sent out weak scent , well , grocery store . some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use toilet which then make you think poop which not all what you going living room . so then you hit expensive pretty versions - perhaps even candle stores cute waxy names . they not candles , my friend . they sculptures . some fancy ones come cute packaging crispy dried flowers . this when you lose your patience . i not want crispy dried flowers . i want candle pumps good scent all over room when i light i t.t his it . votivo . you walk into room room smell like candle . most universally loved scent probably red currant . i also enjoy rain . little glass it comes makes cute vase after candle . plus , they make perfect last minute hostess gifts , box very nice expensive-looking . so , votivo isn't cheapest candle world . they're still cheaper than buying bunch cheap candles stink ... weakly stink .	1
pictures posted here paul joe blotting paper compact don't it justice . compact very beautiful , large all covered pretty flower-patterned material . very feminine , very stylish , very pretty . my only complaint ? i wish it snap or something so it'd stay closed instead only folding ... price bit steep first but fortunately , they consider refills affordable price . my experience , i haven't found different brands blotting paper very different amongst themselves this no exception , it gets job adequately , only prettier package ... far blotting goes , this one blots shine like it should but get it stylish case convenience affordable refills	-1

calling this peel doesnt seem quite right . when i think word peel i imagine old gel type peels you would let dry your face then take off like mask . or i think something harsh or abrasive . while this works like peel it gentle goes far beyond what you would expect facial product . you need this product if you- your skin prone break out very congested - your skin sun damaged - your skin aging rapidly - you enjoy in-office medical peels - you big event coming up want your skin look great - you want maximize penetration your treatment products - you want baby soft skin also if you smoke ! i first tried this years ago when i smoker it made such difference texture clarity my skin . this truly amazing product completely different unique anything else market . try it you'll see . this product also lasts surprisingly long time . you only use half capsule each treatment which gives you several months usage out it	1

i just got this perfume valentine day . i love it ! yes , it sweet smelling , reviewer mentions , but it pleasant sweetness . cotton candy describe it , actually . but who says grownups don't like smelling yummy ?? there hint vanilla well overall , i think combo fantastic ! i love curious , now i love fantasy , too ! they two very different perfumes , so it easy understand why person like one not other . i say , though , fantasy lasts far longer than curious . you apply it morning still smell it when you go sleep ! which , i don't mind all ... i recommend this , course , but i recommend you sample it before you buy . just because you liked curious doesn't mean you like this one	1

so far this best thickening mascara i tried either sold drug stores or department stores . it not sticky or gloppy you won't look like tammy fay spider lashes . i however , apply two coats bring out more sparse areas my lashes , but i finally stopped my search thickening mascaras . my journey ends here	-1
this best micro peel i ever tried ! thing i noticed first when i applied " when hope not enough " " present " they went so smoothly . they absorbed equally . my mid-30 , my young skin fading , but this really brought it back . i won't say i am 19 again , but i am sure difference obvious . i am hairstylist my customers making mention how great my skin looks since i added this my bag tricks . it lot more effective i would thought , i not microdermabrasion since i started using this 2-4 times per month	1

product works well . it whole lot better than using your fingers =	1
i used tend skin around three years now razor bumps bikini line . before i started using it , i tried everything else resigned fact i'd always stuck bumps bikini line . friend mine told me tend skin swore it , so i bought small bottle . it seemed like it expensive , but first bottle lasted well over 6 months . it smell like alcohol first but smell goes away when it dries . far other reviews here , i've only stinging when i used it immediately after shaving ... i think b/c pores still open shower . me , it skin saver when i'd already given up search . i hope negative reviews here don't discourage people trying it . everyone skin reacts somewhat differently . millions bottles tend skin sold every year , i think half dozen people here who didn't like it few unhappy rarities , not average who , like me , thank goodness it around .	1
this very suttle fragrance , lasts hours . slightly floral , however very intimate scent , most people need get very close notice , which good , but also sign you need spray yourself all over . i would recommend picking this up if you want something carry around your purse spray here there . it last hours but not " all day " perfume	-1
all higher end mascaras i've tried , this one far best . your lashes look longer thicker just one coat looks like natural great lashes , not made up . creamy gel formula goes smooth , never clumps or feels sticky-and true form , your lashes curl up nicely . although not water proof mascara , it incredible staying power , cleans off easily . i love this mascara , won't look elsewhere	1
hsuan wen hua hair treatment one best hair treatments i've come across ... i'm huge hair junkie tried many things . ever since finding lush several months ago , i not even touched brand hair care . hsuan wen hua hair treatment made fresh ingredients like bananas , avocadoes fresh olive oil . you use this before you wash your hair , so apply it dry hair . i usually put my hair up pony tail only ends because that where damage . then i twist my hair up bun rubberband plastic bag over it . i try leave it long i ( overnight if i'm lucky ) , shampoo my hair condition like regular after . because this treatment not so much hair conditioner , you still need use seperate conditioner . results amazing my hair so much softer such better condition after use . since i only ends , it easy feel difference ends my hair treated rest my hair not . hsuan wen hua hair treatment m-u-s-t my hair regime . definately recommended	1
i love this shampoo . my husband bought it but i definitely use it more than he :) anyway , it smells amazing really works well my unruly hair	1
this far one best lip treatments market . pricy ... yes . but well worth every cent . few two uses my lips gone cracked whole . tastes good it smells . lemon ... brownsugar .. like body scrub same name . my only complaint : it doesn't longevity say prada lip balm ( which i use when running )	1
this great item lush . it works so well , lasts very long time worth every penny . first off scent . it dead-on fresh coconut . not fake sun tan oil/beach smell you'd expect . it makes ton creamy , thick lather only few swipes through ( soaking ) wet hair . it cleasnes really well rinses clean . me , there no residue left behind , only softness . i said , it last ages but you make sure you leave it well ventilated soap dish drain . if it left water , say goodbye it couple days , you left mushy mess half size when you left i t.t ry it least once , if it doesn't work your hair ... it also great shave	-1

l'occitane lavender harvest matte face lotion * really works * mattify oil makes nice makeup primer . i don't oily skin , but tried some samples over night serum i using avocado oil mattify it , so my face wouldn't greasy my pillow . it left my skin feeling satiny smooth . avocado one heavier , thicker oils wonders my dry skin , but i hated feel it , so finding this real bonus fix problem . lavender oil also relaxing aromatherapeutic properties , natural antiseptic which helps prevent blemishes , mosquitoes don't like it , so if you oily skin live humid climate summer , you should try this ! note : i good luck shopping l'occitane through amazon , but called first make sure what i ordering stock their website .	-1

i brought kit which included both ultra hydrating shampoo conditioner well hair treatment qvc . first all , lets talk smell . yes there smell but it not really bad , honestly . it slight coffee smell , but since i used hair treatment pre-shampoo treatment , smell wasn't really worth complaining because it not noticable after you shampoo . second , hair treatment absolutely great hair braided styles extended periods time or just mistreated needs little tlc . it restores moisture elasticity my starving hair . i don't course or very kinky hair , but it very thick this stuff works very well my thick hair . it also moisturizes scalp , which i love . only thing i'd want change price , wish it little cheaper , but because it not , i guess i value it all more	-1
every other foundation i've tried some ashy undertone , no matter what color i tried , even when color itself right . this one exceptation . they seemed got undertone thing right . i got great coverage , same time managed it looking natural . it oil free , but not chalky : think dewy , not greasy , which i appreciate person oily skin . my skin looked like it naturally near-flawless even , but it also lookked like i wearing little no foundation . i hear it buildable though , so someone who likes cake-face makeup could it	1
ok , this first lipstick my mom let me wear/buy . 15 years ago ! it still my favorite . you can't go wrong	1
i only used clinique eye shadows so happy them . i've tried different brands always come back this one . they great colors it lasts all day without creasing or looking too " powdery " .	1
i wish i could agree pp , but i still problem feathering i tried everything . this product works very well . i wear sheerest lip glosses it stays within my lip line . dark colors , i no longer worry feathering always occurs this keeps lip color inside your lipline . this also works nice eyebrow wax	1
mac lipglass absolute best . there plenty colors choose , super-shiny , gloss thick , stays doesn't run . best colors .... nico cute lavender pink color glittery shine . oystergirl shimmery baby pink . oh baby perfect gloss any earth toned lipstick . chai looks amazing black smokey eyes . it perfect neutral earthy gloss no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine	1
clinique clarifying lotion step #2 their 3-step skin care system . ( you start their soap , then follow lotion dramatically different moisturizer ) . what i love this one , made larger pores , really effectively exfoliates resurfaces your skin without stripping it its natural oils too much . you really feel it working , pull out impurities . well worth investment ....	1
smells fresh slightly fruity but not cloying all . since i generally dislike fruity perfumes plus . nice enough but not heart stopping . i don't think i'll buy it again	-1
its scent makes me want eat apple ... delicious best word it . good daytime , evening , whenever you want smell fresh spring . you'll love it	1
i am very pleased these pencils . quality excellent , i love eyebrow brush connected cover . these pencils worth every cent	1
purchased xmas stocking stuffer ; item received faster than i expected holidays . if you know child enjoys lip gloss collects key chains this ideal	1
these eye liners creamy , soft texture results satiny matte finish . texture makes them easy apply ( no liquid drops cheeks ) either classic thin line or smudged smoky effect . two shades available - black indigo . black jet , true black , indigo merits its name it deep , deep blue looks stunning any eye color . best part color lasts all day into evening without fading or running . it used either wet or dry depending effect you want . , course , they both come mercier trim mirrored signature compact . hint : apply line just above upper lash roots make lashes look fuller thicker . amazing	1
after seeing sjp promote her new fragrance oprah , i smell it myself ! i got my chance magazine , boy i love it ! i hoped get it gift , because it seems bit pricey me . however , i didn't get it . still not sure if i want spend money it , but i love scent	1
this eyeliner works described . i would give it 5-stars except i'm not big fan liquid eyeliners use brush . it too hard control applicator , especially if you want apply under lower lashes . since this brush liquid eyeliner , it can't easily smudged smoky look . course , fact it can't smudged , once it dried , whole point this product . it cleaned up before it dries , but once it sets , it stay there until you take it off . when you want take it off , it comes off very easily , cleanly , really doesn't require anything but plain water remove . i've found very helpful when i travel . i also sensitive eyes , but this product not bothered me all , probably because it doesn't flake or transfer into my eyes . if there just some way get this product " marker " style , few more colors , i would heaven , even high price	-1
i browsing lush newsletter read dream cream used alleviate horribly painful dry skin accompanies cancer patient skin during course chemotherapy . since family member undergoing both chemotherapy radiation therapy , i thought i would buy tub see if it indeed relieve horrid eczema-like patches skin covering her body . i figured we nothing lose ; we tried everything else not found anything worked yet . eternal skeptics , i say we both pleasantly surprised how well it worked . it immediately relived burning itching often accompanies dry skin . it took couple days liberally applying lotion 2-4 times day swelling redness diminish , but it finally disappear . i think if you standard dry skin , applying it this often might make you feel bit greasy side . i found it if you particularly painful dry skin , it helps keep tub dream cream refrigerator . coolness lotion further augments relieving properties essential oils cream . i would say little this cream go quite long way . if you slather ton it once , it leave you feeling bit sticky . earlier review mentioned it leave you feeling greasy if you put it your face ; however , it should noted dream cream meant used hands body not meant used facial moisturizer . i would also say scent definitely herbal , but scent ( least my tub dream cream ) quite subtle . i not find it overwhelming . if you particularly fond strong scents characterize many lush products , then you might disappointed this cream . but , if you dry , itchy , scaly skin , i would strongly recommend this cream . it expensive , but it definitely worth it .	1
living hot steamy florida , looking something refreshing , i gone through range philosphy lemony shower gel combos : first sweet sugar ( very nice sugar smell , hint lemon ) frozen lemon custard ( didn't like it all- too much artificial vanilla smell , but first time i didn't like philosophy product ) now lemonade . i love smell , like sniffing real lemon , not fake lemon scent . very fresh clean . i am following it up lemon body souffle sweet sugar cologne cool , light summery scent . those who say philosophy products cost lot- they pay living wage their employees put more money high-quality ingredients product , not packaging advertising . not get heavy , but i'd rather really good quality product than my dollars going fancy packaging advertising campaign featuring some over-priced cokehead model . so , feeling fresh clean physically ethically	1

" i prefer bubble bars because i like bubble baths also they more economical you break them up use them more than one bath , but sometimes throwing whole bomb treat itself . really indulgent experience , try 1/3 creamy candy bubble slice blackberry bomb - it makes purple bubbles smells so yummy . but only those who like strong scented baths i think ..	1

this shaving gel terrific ! it not sensitive skin , shave it provides very close , so it might irritate those sensitive skin types . it doesn't clog your razor , little definitely goes long way ! only reason i gave it four stars out five , because it goes rather clear , so you really can't see shave lines , so when shaving my legs , i feel it , but other than , it absolutely fantastic , i highly recommend !	-1
i using lancome moisturizers many years every time i try brand i come right back lancome , especially resolution d-contraxol anti-wrinkle treatment . ( they updated/renamed this product few times over years but apparently only add some new ingredients - texture effects consistent i believe better ) . i havent found moisutrizer same feel this one- its light easy blend lets your skin breathe so you don't feel " coated " thick film . i found it makes my makeup go better more evenly since its absorbs right into skin makes it smoother . it truly makes my otherwise dull skin glow ! i can't really testify anti-wrinkle claims because i'm too young wrinkles wear spf 60 every time i leave house , but hopefully its working ! my only complaint it doesn't high spf protection , but i think adding it would totally change product make it thicker , thereby negating all its wonderful attributes . therefore , i highly recommend using it twice daily ( or once if you prefer different nighttime one ) adding high spf top prevent skin damage .	1

if i could lifetime supply these , i would take bath one every day . people keep saying you cut bubble bar half get plenty bubbles , but i felt indulgent i used entire thing . i don't think i've ever seen so many bubbles one bath ! they stayed until end . smell deliciously sweet , water so soft silky afterwards i shaved no shaving cream or anything . this may sound silly , but if someone ever made bed soft those bubbles , i'd want one . i playing them , kind patting them my hands ( which didn't pop them ) , i just could not get over how soft they . when water got cold , i just turned faucet back added more hot water . three times . i so much trouble dragging myself out tub i thought someone going come after me ! i still smell like candy several hours later . i even conditioned my hair totally different scent , my hair definitely smells like bubble bath . i'm addicted lush now ! this month really stressful , i'm getting through it taking bath every evening something lush . massage bars also wonderful	1

first time i put this , i noticed texture little thinner than regular lip venom . flavor more ... i don't know ... medicinal i guess . tingle " maxi-lip " nice , it lasts quite awhile . i put it few times day i got it slightly disappointed i didn't see or feel difference -- until i woke up next morning . there noticeable difference my upper lip cupid bow . i still prefer lip venom over 2nd sin far flavor texture , but this works	-1

this product amazing . i use it under my eyes my cheeks where i enlarged pores then wait 2 minutes apply makeup lines pores gone . it makes makeup last longer too . my daughter breaks out every once while if she something important then we put this stuff over pimple then apply makeup . it makes huge difference again , it helps coverage last longer .	1

i absolutely love this shampoo ! small amount product it takes make mass lather incredible . which nice because you won't go through bottle quickly . it great job gently cleansing my hair without making it feel like straw afterwards . now scent ... utterly addictive ! now i'm not big fan mint smells , but way this blended other scents amazing . you definitely smell mint , but it not any means overpowering . mixed mint wonderful fruit scent , literally smells " juicy " . background , very lightly touch herbal . i happen hate anything herbal , so i surprised i even liked this . smell very unique delicious ! ok , all said though - it just good job most any other lush shampoos ( including some solids ) . i also use their trichomania big they same kind lovely job rehab . price just kills me . i know real oils , juices herbs used , but unfortunately i can't afford make this item staple . still , if you don't problem price , definitely pick up bottle ( start smallest size though ! ) give it try .	-1
i am first time lush customer , but this shampoo alone me convinced try more their products . recently , i noticed my " good old " matrix shampoo left my naturally wavy hair limp dull . i read lush solid shampoo lucky magazine , thought i'd give it try . i ordered seanick through their website . box arrived today , i eagerly ripped it open . seanick arrived wrapped tissue paper i could already smell it . it smelled great , not girly , but like ocean . i so taken this i hopped shower try it out . bar itself just like picture shows -- bright blue studded seaweed . i could see how some people wouldn't like " plants my hair " aspect , but i like it . bar lathered up quickly lots bubbles . i actually kind fun washing my hair once . i put little conditioner well , half what i normally use . i towel-dried my hair , it actually squeaked . pretty clean ! my hair dried , it nice fluffy . believe it or not , it actually curlier my sister said it little lighter . all good things . i use lot product my hair , so maybe it cleaned all off . anyway , my hair feels silky , shiny , soft . i even used it body soap ! what nerd ... i love whole idea behind solid shampoo think it would great travel . i highly recommend this anyone , especially if you limp boring hair . my only complaint awesome smell doesn't last ..	1
i bought this while back used it primarily shampoo/shower gel . i recently put my hair through lot processing worried what this would my perm/color . well , one day i ran out shampoo used this . not only it not ruin my hair , but it made it look smell great . no more heinous perm smell . w00t	1

this truly best highlighting products i tried many high end cheaper products out there . this so light just doesn't get all cakey greasy . i tried so many brands claim look natural , but they just don't . this really don't let price fool you either . it only takes alittle lasts long time , so well worth price look it gives . i love this !	1
philosophy great products , including this lemon custard lip shine . it great product tastes great too ! they matching shower gel body souffle too	1
it non-irritating works . although not effective tretinoin product keeping hyperpigmentations bay , i notice it helps keep my skin plump . it emollient without overly so light enough wear every day . cream little more emollient if your needs require it . i use this every day after cleansing my face	1
i don't know who writes descriptions , but this perfume definitely not sweet . if you find yourself drawn fragrance notes commonly found men cologne you love this fragrance . it unique it feminine but strong woodsy ( i think it oak or cedar ) tone it . it isn't heavy though , fact it very light , very clean , subtly floral , subtly spicy oaky . all all , modern unique fragrance	-1
i agree previous commenter scent doesn't continue post-bath ( which may good thing if you wanted apply different scent , or bad thing if you hoping smell like vanilla afterwards ) also , i wouldn't reccomend just shampooing this only step your hair care regime ( extremely convenient 3-in-1 great travel but not everyday . ) definitely use conditioner !!! but all all it very lovely scent , makes great bubble bath leaves skin silky smooth clean	1
this best conditioner you ever try . i coarse , dry , very straight asian hair this makes my hair unbelievably , ridiculously , shiny soft . i don't know smell though , . . my husband isn't fond it , but boy oh boy this stuff works . i kid you not !!! i tried almost everything out there least expensive stuff i ask " how much !? " none them come close this . only down side lush takes forever ship . i don't know if it would faster order direct . i'm tell you girls , . . try it .	1

this fragrance packs strong punch , so use it lightly , spray it your legs or abdomen , not around your neck . this may why some reviewers aren't fond scent . you'll definitely pick up patchouli , amber , sandalwood . i love wearing this when i big event . i can't add anything atomizer ; i got normal spray bottle .	1
i am very picky perfumes because most stronger-scented ones induce my migraines . my wonderful husband purchased this perfume me last christmas , after i sampled it magazine . i love bottle perfume comes , it comes equipped " foo-foo " atomizer . smell nice warm , it reminds me winter day spent front fireplace . i always get compliments when wearing prada scen t.t he downside it expensive- $95 bottle larger size . but i only use it once week	1

i use these daily after cleansing my face . they wonderful . you feel product working but there no burning or stinging involved , just invigorating toning feeling . scent very nice also . pads thin but generously saturated solution , one pad plenty my entire face neck area . i've tried avon micro peel pads found them too dry . i often used 2 or more time they just weren't moist enough trick . prices comparable i feel you get more treatments out philosphy peel pads	1
just love it ! searching scent like this forever ! when you first put it it soapy clean scent ... while same time hints " just back beach smell !!

ok , i know it gross , but if you didn't think you problem your skin then you wouldn't reading this right now . i tried everything , lots stuff isn't worth 2 cents then there clinique pore refining lotion . this must my daily routine , i even wear it when i am sleeping . how use : wash face , then apply after any serums you may use , but before moisturizer sunscreen , primer , concealor or foundation . not put too much if you planning layering makeup top it , it make your makeup flake off your skin . this not something you would smear all over , only your oily areas ( such nose , chin etc ) . if you use it your dry areas , it make your face look dry . nobody wants face dandruff their black turtleneck . what it : makes your face appear less oily , reduces size pores slightly first few times you use it , but pores get smaller if you use it everyday . it also feels pretty nice when you rub it ( warm tingly ) . it contain salicyclic acid , so it prevents pores clogging . size tube huge , it least month or two daily use . i think this works better than any clean-and-clear product , better than biore pore strips , thus more expensive price . only bad thing this product it may dry out your skin if you use it too much cause flaky skin . one other benefits it reduce amount oil your skin produces throughout day , thus you won't blot or powder pat much normal	1
this fantastic product ! i cannot wash my hair without it . i am so used this towel sucking up all extra water when i just use normal bath towel it actually feels weird all excess water my hair . this also cuts down lot blowdryer time too . i fine , medium length hair this works fantastic me . i highly , highly recommend this anyone who wants save time drying their hair morning get out door faster .	1

let me first start saying i love ' touch ' burberry , i wear it more than i wear any other cologne i own . it very versatile not too strong its fragrance . however , scent doesn't last very long you may spray few more times than usual achieve results last your hoping . ' touch ' first cologne burberry designed leans towards " sour " smell but this case , it works . ' touch ' very romantic , elegant , provocative , sensational all once ... but its effects only minimal . maybe if it redesigned produce long-lasting results then i would probably add 5th star this rating but unfortunately , scene span ' touch ' only leave me wishing .	-1

***** this my daily moisturizer several years . it makes my skin very soft , very healthy looking , glowing . it makes me look radiant . i given it gift my sister other women , they all liked it much i . no one any adverse reactions . you notice difference after just one use . when i've run out used something else temporarily , i always see difference again once i start back up . it close it gets miracle cream . i not wear makeup , so hope jar it . i am 49 years old i think my skin looks incredible . friends i given it also like keep natural look prefer their skin without heavy creams , thick moisturizers sunscreens , or makeup . women i know who fans hope jar like me . we're kind lazy no-fuss " one cream it all " people ; instead one jar something one thing , something else --- eye creams , night time moisturizers , daytime moisturizers , etc . --- we're type wants just one job then it . other words , we don't patience fuss our looks lot , or spend money buying bunches different creams keep track remember use . unlike other reviewers , i love smell , which not perfumey , but definitely pleasantly distinctive . i use it around my eyes also , not allergic reaction . it seems , though , these two biggest problems hope --- distinctive odor allergic reactions among some people . i would suggest buying it first time somewhere you could return it if you don't care it ; although my opinion , this would unlikely , apparently it possible . philosophy now makes version hope jar sensitive skin ; if you know your skin tempermental , perhaps it would better also try this version . i stuck hope jar because it works so well me . it seems expensive , but it not because it lasts long , long time . tw o-o unce jar lasts me six months . i use toner then hope jar that it . i'm my face 30 seconds . plus , it gives me look most women use makeup get , so i think it bargain . ***	1

scale 1 5 , packaging gets negative 1 . you can't sqeeze conditioner out bottle , ended up removing top . value product , jonathan gets 1 . quality product 3 . conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter . need use more than average . conditioner average detangling after using it four times it condition your hair , but no better than other quality brands . i like it seems cut down drying time , but bed head similar product that out while . option i would rather choose bed head quality price	1

watching show i thought jonathan really cared hair its no doubt he still but his shampoo leaves alot desired . example , even hot , very humid atmosphere houston , tx it left my hair feeling dry unhealthy , even after using his conditioner ( alot it ) . my hair looks awful after using it . bottle claims it doesn't use toxic ingredients like mea but it use three different types peg , petroleum based thicker found most bath products erode wooden tables just minutes . this just harmful mea , especially people sensitive scalps hair . it claims not strip your hair but products supposed cleanse much less apparent product than peg products . since peg thickener , you're also getting diluted , toxic , solution . even though head shoulders uses mea i find even works better than this . my hair doesn't feel like it any more its essential oils i've switched back other hair products iv'e using . it not worth your 20 dollars , its barely worth 5 dollars . my hair stylist also recommended dove products if you need hydration . don't buy it !	-1

this hit or miss product . i ordered 5 oz jar while smell nauseating ( burnt coffee/caramel/cigarettes ) , product work while . my extremely dry , curly hair soft shiny but then product became too heavy my hair stopped working . i would save my money experiment other oils such coconut , jojoba , almond , avocado before shampooing or after . i adjusted my hair routine using natural shampoo conditioner adding jojoba oil my curl cream it never happier . if you want try product , ask company send you samples or find store sells them .	1
disappointed customer . i very thick , coarse , wavy hair trying manage it nightmare ! before using fekkai luscious curls lotion , i using aveda curly lotion matrix curl . life contouring creme . both latter products work very well my hair . i don't like blow dry my hair ( too time-consuming ) , so i just air dry it . without blow drying , whether i'm using aveda or matrix , results great ! my hair smooth , shiny , less frizzy . i never used fekkai products before , but decided give this one try . everything luscious curl enhancing lotion claimed , didn't my hair . fact , it actually made my hair worst ! it became stiffer , drier looking , frizzier . addition , my wavy hair , ( usually bouncy alive ) , became flat dull . also , i didn't like scent this particular curling lotion . it very strong smelling made me nauseous . because my very poor experience fekkai luscious curls lotion , i wouldn't recommend it anyone . i think i'll stick aveda matrix curling lotions , since they much more compatible my hair .	-1
i've using this product almost 2 months i seen no difference whatsoever appearance my dark circles . yes , it burn ! only thing i'm glad i bought it ebay cheaper than it normally sells elsewhere . i've dark under-eye circles all my life . i suppose i should just learn live them save my money . i not wasting my money this product again	-1
i sensitive skin this product burned my skin , leaving burn marks weeks ! finally , i went dermatologist who prescribe something help skin heal . please , check your doctor first before trying this	-1
this doesn't work . first time i tried it , it seemed if my eye liner smudged more . so i tried it again ... again ... again .... i've given up it . it totally doesn't work	-1
but i won't buy this again . it smells good dipping it into one bare escentual powders make lipstick neat . but product doesn't really moisturize my lips i haven't found color i like my lips once i dip this into bare escentuals powder . i won't buying this again , i probably just try lip gloss next time	1
i am big philosophy fan . i bought best facial cleanser ever them(purity ) . i two other fragrances i bought scent unsmelled , them . amazing grace lovely pure grace tremendous . get them . don't buy falling love . it yucky	-1
one , i don't think this better than botox . botox works instantly more dramatically , but it more expensive . however , when you think how much you're spending this strivectin , applying it every day rest your life , you could get botox ( yes , you need get more botox every several months , but costs same ) . not only , but botox simply works better . however , if you just can't afford botox , then i would buy rulinea fx which exact same ingredients strivectin , but half price , it available hsn.co	1
never i so unhappy my makeup i when i using clinique . i used stay beige ( which i lightly patted my face top clinique superfit liquid makeup - i oily skin told this would help reduce shine ) end result it just made me look ghostly . i also hated how clinique liquid foundation powder didn't matching shades , so i settle honey liquid beige powder . much i went back macy try convince them these weren't my shades , they just wouldn't listen . either they didn't time or patience help me pick new shade , or they convinced i making big deal out nothing . instead sitting there arguing them ( which i shouldn't first place ) i just switched different makeup line : laura mercier , which i am very happy . i've many other friends who unhappy clinique switched over different makeup brand , well . i'm not trying knock product . i'm just saying it wasn't me or many other people i know . i would definitely not recommend clinique anyone . i'd rather pay little more get better results rather than settle $20 product just because it affordable .	-1
i honest . i bought all hype mineral make-ups . my sister uses bare essentials her skin looked flawless she uneven tones like i . i didn't want pay price or join club so i tried pur minerals . i still use " cover-up " under my eyes blemishes put pur minerals rather heavy get " flawless " look . but then it looked too powdery . i started using my regular cover-girl foundation powder again i felt it covered better less heavy . just note , my sister said she still uses " cover up stick " when using bare essentials too , but she looked beautiful it	1
i fairly sensative skin use most dior products but this product made my skin peel off my face . very careful test this first your hand	-1
so i bought this item i hated it . i wash my hair everyday it completly dryed out my hair ! it smell good though but other than ive used it 4 times thats all it took realize this just not me	-1
i usually enjoy products philosophy but this stuff not worth washing family xolo , amigo . trust me . this stuff stinks ! if margarita what you craving , then stop local don pablo lunchtime . not only this stuff smell bad skin , but , bottle warns , using this product cause irritation skin urinary tract . not good . i say one good thing this product : it made drains my home smell lime-fresh days after poured entire contents down them .	1
poor quality construction -- bristles mine started falling apart first use . plus , it much rougher than something like loofah . you might well tie couple shoestrings dog brush use	-1
i ordered this march 17th didnt recieve until april 5th !! it smelled horrible like weird chalk chemical smell i called lush who said it probably just bad batch send it back my own expense ($5 ) this after i waited forever recieve product smells horrible .. im very mad lush.com not ever order anything them again except angel delight soap .. pissedoff	1
it called " narcisso rodriguez " . buy nr , you'll like it whole lot more	1
overpriced mediocre soap terrible perfume	1
this product might better oily skin no make-up . point it lost me . it may create barrier treatment products/moisturizer make-up but it nothing perfect my skin . fact when i touched my face i could feel make-up pilling rolling off . it dry , heavy feeling it . don't use too much careful dry patches . i thought it would make better canvas my skin . i now use laura mercier primer which goes light smooth gives healthy glow . i didn't like formulation philosophy product all	1
i normally like warm , sensual-type perfumes , but i wanted try something different change . i liked fact this advertised subtle not perfumey . well ... i disagree . i think it very perfumey not subtle all . me it very sharp , high-toned scent which almost acrid . i thought first maybe i sprayed too much , so i tried just little spritz . still very strong sharp . i agree comparison dead flowers dryer sheets . i definitely not ordering this again .	-1
one my " boys " bought this item me , well its ok price ... its kinda sticky skin unless you rub it really well ... scent extremly light which i dont like , now if they make it stronger ... this would 5 star product	1
i am dissatisfied lush claims many its products , like this one , natural . i encourage buyers who looking products made natural ingredients carefully read ingredients lush products . i yet see lush product not contain chemicals questionable safety . there numerous other brands truly all-natural soaps shampoos work excellently	-1
i've this dryer almost year now , like styists who also own it , i find it temperamental . it great job while it working , but thermostat gets progressively buggier after three months . if you turn dryer off , you'll wait it cool completely before it turn back . now , it turns off while i'm middle doing my hair . stylists three or four these so they alternate working one while other(s ) cool off - i said , when they work , they're terrific . i'm going replace mine brand	1
this fragrance ok teen princesses . this scent doesn't linger too subtle . not nice vera wang vanity or sheer veil . i don't recommend this unless you 16 under . i gave it my 11 year old she loves it	1
i'm everyone else when they say they diappointed this product . i opened this bottle , expecting totally yummy scent but what i got nothing like what i expected ! when i read it smelled nesquick , i thought i'd like it anyway , because i love strawberry nesquick . but this stuff smells like ... well , i can't describe it . all i know i wish i hadn't paid $16 it . live learn , i guessperhaps strawberry ice cream 3-in-1 gel smells better . off topic , why they strawberry milk shake 3-in-1 gel strawberry ice cream 3-in-1 gel ? wouldn't they smell just same	1
i knew i taking chance buying cheap eye cream sure enough i right . it nothing ! well yo get what you pay ! i going try ocuderm or ddf products i guess i now . costs more but results i hear great . i should known better ...	-1
some lush products wonderful ... this isn't one	-1
this item not even work price you pay i feel it rip off	-1
i received this free sephora birthday present because i signed up beauty insider . i gave it my neice her 7th birthday she likes it , but there no reason this product should cost $16 . i'm betting ingredients , packaging shipping costs don't total more than $3 . i wouldn't buy it .	1
i read many good reviews this product this site elsewhere so i eagerly bought it . it came quaint little tin but i thought it smelled kind awful . skin softner , it worked well but i threw it out after using it only few times because way it smelled	1
i bought ultra hydrating shampoo , conditioner , treatment , oh also hairspray . these products dried my hair out horribly weighed it down . i gave it 2 weeks because it so expensive after two weeks my hair never looked any worse ! i naturally wavy , thick coarse hair this made my hair unmanageable - like helmet head . my hair no movement , no shine -- just made it very heavy weighed down . last night i used hair purifier shampoo gets gunk , minerals , etc out your hair after i deep conditioned it kerestase masintense - wow , what difference !! afer blowdrying my hair it soft , shiny so much bounce ! i woke up this morning my hair still awesome . so glad my old hair back - i beginning think i hormone problem or water problem but it this ojon product - horrible if you type hair i . good luck	-1
i am asian i very thick coarse hair . i bought this product due all rave but it nothing me , it doesn't even smell nice . after trying numerous products flat irons , i thermal reconditioning - my hair never smoother , silkier so easily manageable . no product or styling necessary , just wash go	-1
i ordered this product my wife 3 weeks before christmas several other philosophy items . they shipped , this backordered . i've sent three messages them , not heard sinlge response . terrible . aparently customer services not " philosophy " this company subscribes . i gone ahead filed formal complaint through amazon . you probably better off buying their products brick mortar store . their online presence unreliable best .	-1
beauty case gift , it never reached it recipient . i would like know what i might refund . i am very irritated it birthday present my 7-year-old goddaughter . please advis	-1
i bought this item because i heard it waterproof i looking something wear swimming . i'm really not impressed . one thing i say it color blended well my skin . bottle it looked like it would way too dark , so i surprised . it looks like there might little wiggle room far choosing correct shade this one . coverage not very good , though . you put little extra without it looking cakey , but it doesn't cover well say lancome photogenic foundation . i also highly doubt it waterproof . water-resistant , maybe . defintely not waterproof . it rubbed off pretty easily dry kleenex even more came off wet one . when i tried coverblend water resistant makeup i use soap get it off . coverage also much better . unfortunately they don't offer many shades leg body makeup . i also found dew finish not work my skin . i combination skin tend shiny t-zone . this foundation left me shiny nose forehead . it also made rest my face feel slightly oily , which it normally not . overall i would say this foundation very poor value i defintely returning it sephora . least sephora free returns . :	1
i bought this mascara based review i read amazon . maybe it just me , but i still find my lashes " clump " or stick together this product . it might navy color . i don't think its worth extra cost - i just well drugstore mascara	1
smell gorgeous ; it really lives up its name " happy " -- ( just lightly musk-touched citrus overtones - it great scent day or night ) , but -- this big but , like real happiness , it very elusive . scent skin , it completely fades away after 10 minutes ! example , today i sprayed it quite liberally now can't smell it all , even if i put my nose my wrist ; i swear , it completely gone . very disappointed , thus cannot recommend it . 5 stars scent but minus 4 stars staying power = 1 star . even lightest perfumes should staying power , or else what point wearing them ?	-1
i got talked into buying this fresh boutique las vegas . first , it very expensive - $38 , forgivable if it outstanding . it not even good . wand isn't well made , product clump it , then it clumps eyelashes rather than lengthen them . i tried all week make this purchase work out best , but no avail . worst part , end day if i happen rub my eyes , it smears - racoon eyes . i've using physicians formula revlon primer both exponentially better , i could purchased eight them cost supernova . positive side , it washes off easily completely soap water .	-1
i very unhappy this product . first shipping took way too long . second , tube much smaller than sold macy cost more . contents gross , very goopy . not smooth . like it sitting hot warehouse months . i'll fight mall buy this next time	-1
it doesn't work what we intended it : blackhead removal . my teen son really hoping this would help him .... it didn't . not only , but safety cap lance end doesn't stay .	-1
only reason i'm giving this two stars instead one because i love benefit . said , this perfume what we like call sleeper . it so faint you hardly smell it , but when you , it not pleasing all you immediately scramble something smells better . if you looking young , fun perfume , stay away this one . it smells old drab , like your grandmother china cabinet or antique store . but if you like ..	1
i wouldn't call these regrettable purchase ... i guess i just little mislead how these thing worked . it doesn't explain packaging . i couldn't figure out why box so heavy . they just socks , right ? right ?? well , they aren't . insides coated some sort heavy-duty silicone . this makes your feet sweat when you put them . i mean , they really sweat . when you wake up , you're feet sweat so much any outer layer skin cells you sloughed off . hence soft feet . very warm feet . they'll good winter . reason why you're only supposed wear these once week because i bet you'll get really alarming fungus if you it more . i tried them two nights row once day 3 greeted me intense athletes-foot-like itch . not fun . other gripe i they don't come washing instructions . great . these socks one purpose life , make your feet sweat then refuse washed . i found handwashing them sink some handsoap works fine . now , anyway . i don't think they belong washing machine . laundry horror story likely ensue .	1
over $ 1,000 moisturizing cream ? saying goes : " fool their money soon parted	-1
yikes . i so surprised size bottle . i no idea it would small price . scent nice but i would not reorder .	1
i very unhappy this product . first shipping took way too long . second , tube much smaller than sold macy cost more . contents gross , very goopy . not smooth . like it sitting hot warehouse months . i'll fight mall buy this next time	-1

i love clinique products used them more than 20 years . exfoliating scrub convenient because it comes tube rinses off easily . ( though you only get 3.4 oz ., must use quite bit it see good results ) . however , it not work well original " seven day scrub " . original product while greasy bit pain use , exfoliates almost well professional microdermabrasion not irritate - even daily use . few years ago i spent summer neglecting use my sun block . needless say , my skin became mess ( dull , blotchy , discolorations , rough , flaky , etc . ) . i began my basic clinique regimen ( mild facial soap , clarifying lotion #2 , dramatically different moisturizing lotion , seven day srub ) . less than two weeks i saw huge difference , my skin back normal . i tried exfoliating scrub later , since i hated deal original " seven day " but soon went back it it truly works best . now i always wear spf 45 my face stick my seven day scrub .	1
this item fine when it came pictures ; tattoos not visible film first part our wedding . however i told few guests it looked like i fight before wedding ... make-up should not look like bruises ! make-up also started fade not long after ceremony ended , it short ceremony . end reception ( four hours later ) you could clearly see tattoos . also , i told make-up would not rub off onto clothing if i used special setting powder together cream ... not true . i now make-up stains one my brides maids dresses . i realize now i should just let tattoos show . why tattoo if you're not willing show it off	1
this my first cologne purchase . it really delicious scent -- complex pleasant , not overpowering . give it 15 min dry mix your skin . it truly smell different first spray . i can't stop smelling myself ... i really love smell . my only complaint ( it biggy ) it doesn't last more than few hours . after two or three hours it completely gone except slight trace when i press my nose my skin . i've tried spraying it my body ( neck , wrists ) also my clothing , it just doesn't last . i feel need carry bottle me reapply it every few hours , but that not going realistically happen . it really disappointing , since it so delicious	1
ok , so this 2nd philosophy product i've tried felt need write review . i say , this product far below expectations . i sprayed , only thing you smell alcohol . there seems no other notes it , even after you let it settle , all you pick up alcohol . definitely not recommending this product .	-1
i love , love , love , lipglass normally . but this shade terrible unless you want look like bad go-go dancer .	-1
i bought this stuff because i heard it helped razor burn . my husband likes me shave bit more often than i liked , well , too bad him !! pain putting this stuff way worse than any sort razor burn ! no thanks !	-1
i used use tend skin . it works ok , but there better things out there now . tend skin outdated product ... like sytptic pencil . tend skin stings , smells like pure alcohol there lots wasted product because it easy spill . i recently switched min solution2 like it much better than tend skin . min solution2 roller application ( no waste ) , organic spearmint ( fresh smell ) doesn't burn like tend skin .	1
i love these products however , this particular candle not same , intense scent previous candles i've purchase	1
this perfume smells like you just sprayed lemon pledge all over . it terribly strong just not quite what i wanted . company promptly give me refund though . i suggest you try out " demeter fragrances . " they more natural smelling	-1
like fresh farmacy , i bought this soap based reviews ended up giving it friend work . don't get me wrong , i love most lush products , my husbands chagrin , end up spending lot money their online products but when i got this particular soap i just couldn't get into it . i admit it smelled bit better after showering it first time but still found myself reaching my " sexy peel " over this stuff . i ended up giving it friend i work but only after it passed over my three other girls my office ... i'm just not getting " heavenly scent " this item described previous reviews	1
i bought this my wife holidays , it bit expensive candle but i believed it would last long time burn uniformly . however , our case , after hour candle went out . wick burned too quickly , becoming too small , now candle won't stay lit more than few minutes before it drowns wax . return shipping cost lot , so we just toss it out . waste money , don't buy one	-1
this brush not firm expected . i expected greater quality sephora brand . however , price brush rather cheap comparison " finer " brushes . so actuality you getting whay you pay this item nothing more	1
this shampoo just awful . it greasy it made up 90/10 ratio , 90 oil 10 soap . smells great but leaves your hairl slimy gross	-1
i received two sizeable chunks karma soap couple my orders i thought i'd give it go . eeeep - there whole bunch patchouli there ( which i hate , but still thought i should least try ) . maybe i'm overly sensitive patchouli but it so strong . soap whole smelled like sickening mix syrup-y orange soda mixed dreaded patchouli . fair though , you smell different elements it appreciate it . aside this , this soap melts incredibly fast . even if you keep it draining soap dish , even if you take it completely out shower , away steam , it still melts alarming rate ! i see how people ( who love herbal scents ) would like this . it unique scent depth layers it , but it just not me	-1
like said earlier review , after couple weeks mirror quits working fogs up so bad you can't see thing it shower . i run hot water it it still fogs up after couple minutes , then you can't clear it any method . total waste , not worth dollar .	-1
rosey this oils smells , it just isn't good real thing . fragrance oil , it no medicinal properties . i certainly wouldn't use it my skin , or bath ! thanks , but no thanks . you definitely get what you pay	-1
i opened my falling love compact expecting lovely smell after reading hype . this worst smelling perfume-ever . when i put it it smelled like burnt clothing-like iron just it worst cotton . it so awful i put it straight bin	-1
i received this soap free online purchase . i never purchased soap lush i don't think i after my experience ooh la la . scent pleasant enough , color bar this stunning deep purple ( kind like grape ! ) , but it doesn't feel like soap when i'm using it . it kind smears purplish film me then when i rinse it off , my skin feels very tight dry . i've unable get any lather this bar , although admittedly i very hard water where i live . i read previous reviewers complained how long this soap lasts . like all lush products , it imperative you not leave it shower or tub let it dry completely uses . i've used bar four or five times while it noticeably smaller than when i opened it , i probably 90 percent it left .	1
i truly say this products doesn't work . i silky wavy fine hair i am hair food junkie so i used lot things , but this don't work . usually anything tame my hair but all this conditioner make it hard , matted , tangled . carol daughter products may work some , but it hasn't work anyone my family we all different hair textures	-1
i fell hype now am out quite bit money ....... save your money , trust me ! i used this product 2-3 times day until entire tube gone ( took several months ) saw no change whatsoever ! i serious dark circles , which what it claims help . i am very disappointed this company their product never buy any item their name it again ! what bunch crap ...... btw - look * all * reviews , this product listed several places here !!	-1
click-stick applicator ridiculous . you no control over shadow . when you click it , nothing comes out . you twist ten times , then , suddenly , huge blob , enough eighteen applications , comes busting out . only way i've found apply this use my own shadow brush dipped this huge blob . i purchased three colors same time all three tubes work this same way . far actual shadow , it fine . nothing spectacular . you could get same product wet'n wild buck .	1
i spent $$$ this supposed miracle product month ago .... don't waste your money ... absolutly no results .	-1
i used phytospecific relaxer my virgin hair during summer ( 2006 ) . i first thought it great investment ($60 ) worth cost . after use , i found my hair relaxed but not " bone straight " i've experienced other relaxers which what i desired . my hair very soft fine quite sensitive chemicals so i search product would straighten my hair not leave any damaging affects . after 2nd treatment ( september 2006 ) , i soon found my hair experiencing breakage around temples severe breakage nape my neck . i quit using product . perhaps this product works some but mentioned earlier , my hair quite sensitive chemicals unfortunately , i experienced hair loss ! so , it back drawing ( or growing ) board me	1
instructions say , " use whenever your skin needs boost . " it goes imply you see result every time you use it - it not one these products where you need use it repeatedly see results . i bought it big upscale department store used it night . now winter approaching , my skin gets little wacky times . product comes out gel but becomes creamy you apply it damp skin . instructions leave it until " full froth " forms ( approximately 5 minutes ) , then rinse off . cream began take consistency foam after 2 minutes , end 5 minutes foam beginning dissipate leave big empty patches my skin , so i rinsed it off . my skin didn't look any different when . it didn't feel any different when . $52 i expected least some type visible change - even if it made my skin redder , or plumper , or something . unfortunately box now bottom trash , so i can't return it . we christmas guests coming ; maybe one them enjoy using it	-1
all honesty , i'd rate fragrance itself " 5 stars , " however , scent not last love nor money , which why i give it mere " 1 star . " you'll find you continuously apply it order anyone compliment you it , consequently , before you know it , you've depleted your perfume ! talk anyone who worn or even sells this fragrance , if they're honest , they tell you exactly what i've written here . because i adore scent , i'm going try baby phat goddess body lotion see if lingering effect	-1
this didn't anything me . it supposed very subtle cumulative effect ? i am returning it . i'm really surprised others such great results , because i tried it twice left it double time , still it nothing more than wash my face maybe moisturize cream . it more than baking soda h2o2- also contains catalase , some stearic acid , some vitamin . course , your skin already its own catalase .	-1
ok ive using proactiv 4 year now i say it work me well like 90% one or two breakouts month so i pretty pleased . people often asked me what i cuz my change drastic , so nice . one night i styed up late murad infomercial came it looked pretty convincing since there where no celebritys advertising it they even compared it proactiv , so i tough i would give it try so i ordered it online next day . couple days later i received package i pretty exited so i began use it liked overall feel it . few days pass i wake up one morning all these little white heads my upper chin i immidiately grossed out but since they said it normal due purging i didnt worry much , one week later it got worse even began breaking out places i hadnt before like my forehead . i knew somethign wasnt right so i went online started reading other custumer reviews shocked similaruty thwe problem so i freaked out decided stop using it because it got so bad point where i didnt wanna seen top it became very painful both physically mentally i becamed sorth depressed situation i sorth felt like teen going trough puberty again . i now gone back proactiv seen improvement so hopefully within next couple weeks it clear up again untill then i wanna crawl under rock hahaha . my main advice really ur research before trying something new because u may end up worse than before	-1
like others i disappointed after couple times using this product . like others i started breakout where i not broken out before , my forehead etc . i bought this product because i problem areas . using this product brought out more problem areas dried out my skin . i used product prescribed . commercial said it gentle what made this product different rest it wouldn't cause acne only it " gentle " formula help it immediate results . not true all . this just like any other product market acne . if you weeks pain suffering embarrassing breakouts more than what you before get results , this product you . i , other hand , couldn't deal additional embarrassment my skin getting worse before it got better . when my trouble areas weren't bad first place . not recommended they advertise . they aren't different than others . proactive same thing .	-1
i didn't know you supposed peel waxy rubbery black stuff off soap ... i normally get store-bought olive oil soap but it smelled so good , i try it . i ended up covered black , waxy streaks all over my body when i got out shower ! they didn't rinse off , either . only thing seemed work rub really vigorously towel ... i still black smudges wax residue . once i figured out how take knife coating , i better opinion soap , except it pretty much cut soap half . it smelled really nice , but i don't think i would get this again .	1
i very high hopes this cream , it appears they went extra mile quality . not so . cream when used leaves alot friction razor goes over your face , making some tense moments should not there . i used many creams . so far art shaving best . casswell massey ok aveda . avoid truefitt . update . trufitt hill accepted return we spoke problems . they sent me new updated extra fine version should available public now same quality massey . it good . standard still substandard	-1
i worked two women who worn this perfume , frankly , i can't stand smell it . it doesn't even smell like perfume , it like some bizarre animal musk . there no floral notes , no woodsy notes , either ; nothing clean or fresh or pleasant . i wish this perfume didn't exist --- i hate it .	-1
i thick coarse hair looking something make it softer . i used just little bit it really greasy . i am currently using lanza anti aging plant serum . it works much better	1
i love , love , love , lipglass normally . but this shade terrible unless you want look like bad go-go dancer .	-1
it only takes little bit reading realize abrading skin piece metal not solution ending blackheads/enlarged pores . using this " extractor " equal using one fingers squeeze out imperfections , which may produce very temporary results , but ultimately fruitless . those who feel need purchase this device should invest professional deep-cleaning instead , which rid skin excess oil help pores close without aggravation	-1
my sister-in-law bought this product me after i admired shade ( purr , light baby pink color ) she wearing . i used other mac products before great results , but very dissapointed this product . first all , i gave this product one star because shade look very pretty lips went very well my skin coloring . however , this product sticky . very sticky ! it not matter whether you apply lot or very little , you still wind up this horrible heavy feeling your lips . not only it sticky , but just down right uncomfortable . when i wear lip gloss , i want soft smooth feeling . i want able rub my lips together without them getting stuck together ' dragging ' so speak . also , because this gloss ' consistancy , it tendency clump together your lips form line ' gunk ' both upper lower lip where two meet rest together when you your moth closed . this start happen only 15 minnutes after application . very embarassing when you talking some hot guy then look mirror afterwards discover you gross lines your lips !!!! this product seems popular other viewers , however , i would never reccomend this anyone	-1
if you some respect your nose , please don't buy these wipes !!! i bought these thinking maybe it would nice soft smell , but these thing more than enough perfume stink your whole house !!! i would never put it delicate skin my baby	-1

i bought tendskin help irritation razor bumps i get my neck shaving . product claims , " reduce appearance unsightly razor bumps , ingrown hairs , redness shaving . " but despite it lofty promises high price , it none this . fact my case it made irritation red bumps worse , i sensitive skin main ingredient this product alcohol . directions tell you apply it after shaving , but because alcohol dries out your skin painful apply after shaving , it only made my problem worse . i wish i could rated this product zero stars , because it absolutely worthless	-1
i think i may bad batch because when i read reviews how yummy it smelled , made me curious . so , i tried it i hated it ! smell it turned my stomach . it soften my hair bit , but i don't recommend using it again . sorry lush	-1
i really excited this ! i hoped it would faster , easier way make up what not , but its not . it smears like crazy , end so sharp , it hurts apply . but doesn't matter ! end stops working after use or two . i suppose if you wanted make up similar raccoon blueish eyes ( black more navy then black ) you'll happy . i've always loved mark products , but this disappointment	1
i bought this product mainly because my daughter fair , sensitive skin , which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation . this product worked very well far thoroughly cleaning her face , hands etc . it not irritate her skin all ... problem , one only problem , fragrance , if you call it . it stinks so bad , i not want go near her after i wiped her down ... i give her bath , it so bad	1
i ordered " fedora " . i am so dissapointed , it came off within few hours ! just peeled right off . not order this brand fingernail polish . it worst i ever used	-1

well first off , i'm guy very short hair ... so i don't know whether or not it really works . but i'm bored decided rate it anyway . so here goes : consconditioner really thick difficult get out bottle . best solution this let bottle sit upside down . prossmells damn good . i'm not big fan fruity/coconut aromas , but i like this particular smell so much i might need go rehab sometime future . bottom line : although this conditioner difficult get out bottle , it smells really good . whether or not it work your hair , only way know try it . even if ot doesn't work your hair ... it worth 20 bucks just open it up smell it every now then . =)	1
very picky shampoo this really good dry color treated hair . i tell it made difference	1
i used this product this morning first time . i washed my hair , blew it dry , most way , then rubbed product my hands lightly distributed it throughout my hair . best way me describe it , , it like creamy hairspray . yes , it tacky , like hairspray , but that how it helps you get style you want . what i like how it works my hair , it really tamed frizzes brought down " big " hair look i usually after blowing my thick hair dry . i think it would also work well days i blow my hair out . i would probably blow it out first , then apply some dirt help tame smooth it . i see where it might make thinner , straighter hair bit limp , so careful not use very much . edit : i think it best apply slightly damp hair , might help people trouble applying it completely dry hair	1
i chi turbo ( 1 " ) , but i got worried after reading some reviews it unreliable . so part reason i wanted buy t3 iron it comes 4-year comprehensive warranty . other difference solid-ceramic plates " infused " tourmaline which i found intriguing . 1-3/8 " wide plates perfect width my long-ish hair . ( i've used 2 inch wide iron , which i found harder maneuver . ) it heats up fast , stays hot . it great job gripping hair without snagging . my hair stays silky straight all day , not feel damaged after while , like it cheaper irons i've used past . thing this iron other irons not well - it really curls . it heat vents sides plates lets you curl your hair twisting it near root pulling it through ( different usual method gripping ends strands then winding up ) . it creates springy curl better than any flat iron i've used . ( however , heating vents make exterior iron hotter touch . so there drawback this function . ) overall , i enjoy using this flat iron . very happy this purchase . eta : i've learned hairart not honor warranty unless you buy it authorized distributor ( e.g. , sephora ) . so you might want check before you place your order	1
after reading other reviews i little worried using product i already ordered . after using it few days now my hair never looked better , i truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner meant me . i fine , super straight hair , middle short . it feels clean sleek . conditioner smells like pina coloda , yum ! i would definatly recommend this my hair type . would maybe recommend lather shampoo your hands first then work thoroughly ( it doesn't lather well some shampoos lots glycerine them ) only apply conditioner towards end your hair leave few min . hope helps	1
high beam nice subtle highlighter . however , sure blend it very quickly well or it look unnatural certain lighting ( it'll look like you pink nail polish your face ) . it also tendency emphasize pores . so only use it areas your face where you don't any , like top cheek bone under your eyebrows .	1
i purchased beauty water shower purification system used it 5 times now fantastic results . i very hard water my home am tired constantly blow dry my hair or use tons products it manageable not frizzy . my hair felt very soft manageable using this product i am hoping it helps my highlights last longer . i not experience ' slimy ' feeling people usually associate soft water . i'm even able let my hair air dry not frizzy this product . i am curious see how long this filter lasts . i called jonathan products told they replacement filter costs $55 so you save bit money when you need replace filter	1
its good waking up , because once you put it you feel refreshed because your lips feel fire . i like sting shine it . it finishes pretty fast roll ball may feel like little drag keep rolling lips , but i think it worth trying it unless you extreme sensitive lips , this stuff strong . i mention great smell ? yum ! me my boyfriend loved it .	1

i love benefit line , everything i tried works great ( not mention they great packaging catchy names all their products ! ) . said , high beam simply amazing . it only takes little dab add nice glow/shimmer my face . i especially like use it cheek bones it leaves nice soft glow . high beam works so much better me than other products i've tried either left my skin sticky or chalky . not mention those other products cost lot more ! if you looking little glow , little shimmer , high beam answer	1
this dry iron absolutely amazing , i really can't say enough it . great all types hair ! it heats up just seconds what would take almost 2hrs blow dry my hair now takes less than half time . plus your hair comes out extremely straight . highly recommend anyone who wants their hair look great but doesnt time or energy sit hair salon hours . it investment your hair , one better ones i've made .	1
this great product getting bed head look . i use approximately dime size worth my palms go wild ! trust me , results great . if you apply too much , you're hair get oily . good thing this product washes out easily any shampoo	1
i long , thick , wavy hair loves frizz up . i tried every anti-frizz , hairstyling product out there , they either didn't work or weighed my hair down . i didn't want like this hair dryer hoping it wouldn't live up hype ... but , it excellent my hair . after using dryer ( no styling product ) my hair straight , shiny felt great . me , it didn't change amount time i dried my hair , so if your considering buying it speed , don't , unless you thin or short hair . it worth $200.00 price tag ? depends you personally , but i recommend you shop around because there better deals out there	1
i bought shampoo theory condition theory this redo freshen-up mist . i normal-type hair needs washed every other day -- if i use lot product , it needs washed every day . i very sensitive skin too . this mist worked very well my hair , definitely freshened it up allowed me restyle it quick blow dry . it feels awesome my skin . well , jonathan	1

my hair tends fall out due me not eating enough protein , so new ! ( hair ) lifesaver . others said , it lathers like you wouldn't believe -- you really only need roll it your hands two or three times get enough thick lather -- it amazing scent . ( sniffing bar actually bit addictive ... you smell it really strongly even before you open box ! ) i've found keeping it small lightly covered dish my bedroom , away moisture bathroom , best way preserve it while . ( also , it works accidental room freshener -- seriously , smell incredible ! )my only wish scent would last little longer my hair , since it doesn't really stick , even right after showering , unless i use lot lather , ends up expensive since then bar doesn't last long . most time , there isn't even much hint , whereas other lush shampoos make your hair smell wonderful , even bit overpowering , days . also , unlike some other lush products , it leaves my hair fairly flat . it true it helps making hair really soft shiny , but it seems opposite effect when it comes volume , that not so good when you're already some hair loss . using mostly scent-free conditioner after almsot necessary , least my experience . i think new ! ( hair ) terrific shampoo its hair-restoring qualities general sniffability , but same time , it could little better its more cosmetic qualities . buy it more former than latter if you want most enjoyment value out it . if you hair loss , trust me -- price worth it	1
since i high school , so many women praised wonders almost lipstick black honey . i finally self-gifted purchased myself , all my expectations met . color initially scary tube , but very least swipe it your hand - you'll see it actually very wearable sheer brownish raspberry color . you layer it stronger color , or swipe it over lip balm make it even more sheer . resulting effect your lips , but better . color your lips improved they moist shiny looking . if you layer repeatedly over dry lips it very shiny deep red brown color . i've seen black honey worn fair/medium asian white women looked flattering every one them . lastly , product not smell . it no perfumes become disgusting day wears , nor it cheap waxy smell/taste . fabulous product	1
i extremely dry skin builds up needs exfoliation frequently , i've tried every body wash , gritty scrub , brush soap known , clarins down caress , this bar works like magic me ! i didn't notice fantastic decrease cellulite , little bumps wear off . but using soap practically " molts " me , leaving dead skin behind bathtub ( yikes ! ) , i'm ready application other products right into my new skin ( fat girl slim ... clarins total body firming cream ... i prefer dior plasticity ) . goodbye ingrown hairs- stuff great prevention . i metion great exfoliator prior self-tanning ? this stuff great buy ! long-lasting soapy smell interferes my perfume only reason i gave it 4 stars	1
tweezerman browmousse clear gel you brush onto your eyebrows hold them place . i tried other brands styling gels brows left very disappointed - they flaked looked all stiff gross . since i am such huge fan tweezerman tweezers , i figured i would give their browmousse try boy , i ever satisfied ! this gel held my brows place all day without single stray . no flaking ! no stiff brows ! it so easy apply . it comes mascara style brush you simply whisk over your brows style keep them where you want them . it stays all day comes off easily make up remover . browmousse definite step up all other brands i've tried . i recommend this product all my friends .	1

i'm very particular stuff i put my face . i've used nivea aloe , jack black , kiehls , baxter among others . i decided give it shot all i say wow . it says it fragrance free , but it got small ( very very very small ) hint lemon perhaps ? you only need liberal amount you're good go . moisture retained glycerin it soothes aloe chamomile ( mmmm ) . if you're looking subtle , yet tasteful facial lotion that made men , you've gota try this . it even allergy tested . not mention , part proceeds donated prostate cancer research .	1

word wise sizeif this your first time buying lush soap online , forewarned . you receive piece 1 " thick 4-5 " long . other words , you receiving fairly small piece soap . if you lush store near you , i strongly recommend you go smell huge chunks soap they display . once you find scent you like , buy � lb brick it . it cost little over $20 , but it worth it if you find soap you love . i also find it easier experience full scent soap bigger slice . i know lush stores few far ( closest one me 35 miles away -- not far , but too far convenient ) , but if you grab couple friends make road trip out it , it adventure ! now , rock star . what delightful soap . if you fan mmmm .... melting marshmallows bath melt , then you also enjoy rock star . scent same . it also same snow fairy shower gel creamy candy bath melt . i cannot quite place my finger scent . main ingredient it vanilla absolute , but this smells much more sweet girly . there definite floral scent lurking under vanilla , but i am loss try describe it ! it sort smells like warm cotton candy hint brown sugar . it closest i come trying describe scen t.t he scent rock star linger your skin entire day . it absolutely wonderful . it also leaves your bathroom smelling wonderfully fresh . every time my husband uses upstairs bathroom , he come find me ask what smells so good our bathroom . it fabulously creamy soap it lathers quite well . if you white tile your bathroom , it leave pink lather pile tile , but it easy enough wash off . there couple minor downsides rock star . but they minor : 1 . it melts way too fast . i just wished it lasted bit longer . 2 . it leave skin feeling bit too squeaky clean . when i first started using rock star , i thought it would give me dry skin , but hasn't case . it just feels bit dry after showering . despite these small issues , rock star perfect soap make you feel bit girly bit sexy , all same time .	1

like someone else said , i don't problem paying high quality beauty item works it says it . cinnamon buns great lather , smells wonderful when you use it , makes your skin soft . i used it shampoo scent lingers bit longer using it your hair , but it really doesn't function well shampoo it shower gel . bubble bath ya use so much it i just can't it . i find myself counting ounces i'm pouring under faucet decided use it treat only . smell doesn't last very long , but found it linger longer if you lather , rinse repeat , like it says bottle . it dollar ounce ..... not sure if i'll try any other ' flavors ' simply because cost	1

this product works very well my fair nordic sensitive skin . it covers well , but light , non-oily feeling , combined fluff og powder , it leaves my skin looking flawless . i highly recommend this product .	1
if i choose fragrance most feminine i've ever smelled , it would marc jacobs . yes , it gardenia based scent , but definitely not your typical musty , heavy gardenia any means . marc jacobs different it ' wet gardenia ' , like you're smelling bunch gardenias swirling around bowl fresh water . intoxicatingly alluring . notes this fragrance : gardenia , wild muguet , skin musk , cedar , ginger . gardenia this faint , but lovely . it isn't knock-you-out strong gardenia , but very mellow mesmerizing . it'll follow you like breath fresh air , you'll people sniffing air you leave behind . :) if you've ever smelled michael michael kors , this different . michael not gardenia , but it tuberose scent . it very strong , creamy , heavy , thick . if you like michael , you may like marc jacobs your spring/summer alternative . they're same family terms florals such , but different terms how they wear . marc jacobs flowy , michael heavy . 1.7 oz . retails $65 , 3.4 oz . $85 . it quite expensive , but it brand-name smacked front . :) i think it worth it . lasting power decent . even when you may feel it gone , it not , people compliment you . try it out see how you like it your skin	1
my boyfriend used search online stores french cologne jean patou pour homme because it only " upscale " cologne he would wear ( it awesome ! ) . however , it not produced anymore very hard find very expensive . he searched high low find replacement , this it ! sean john unforgivable surprisingly good . masculine , but not too musky or cheap smelling . now , this all my boyfriend wear - i'm not complaining ! guys - women love how you smell when you wear this . women - buy this your boyfriends/husbands , but only let them wear it when they're date you ! :) anyway , it worth cost , it our new favorite .	1
i never smelled any cologne good this . unforgivable absolutely wonderful ! i saw diddy several talk shows promoting this fragrance thought here we go ... famous person perfume industry - not gonna any good . so i go shopping other day see tester bottle . i try it . sprayed it little piece paper immediately asked sales clerk give me biggest bottle they . it amazing . my boyfriend comes home work , i present him cologne he wasn't thrilled ( not into colognes such ) , but promises try it anyway . he didn't hate it !!! that thrilled he gets anything , so i knew then it good thing . i just can't quit smelling him , his clothes , his car - everything smells unforgivable ! we went out some friends dinner drinks both my girlfriends pulled me aside ask what cologne he wearing - they wanted buy it their guys too ! now i can't wait women fragrance come out ... seanjean definitely winner here	1
i really like this conditioner lush . i wash my hair everyday , because this ( long soaks bath ) my hair gets pretty dry . this conditioner absorbed really quickly doesn't overpowering scent . i am not huge fan coconut , but this shampoo makes my hair smell like tropical cocktail which i think really nice . i wouldn't use it every day don't recommend it unless you dry hair needs bit extra care . i used american cream but i think coolaulin better , least my hair . i thick , straight , mid-length hair . great conditioner make hair soft but strong , also shiny	1
after suffering terrible cold all week i finally succumbed hot bath . i rummage through my box filled lush products ( gift thoughtful boyfriend ) when i pulled out this huge disc broke out half while saving other one more bath . i didn't even know what this called but minute it touched water , refreshing invigorating essences lemons milky cream escaped my nose , i felt happy instant , it amazing ! even thought my nose refused recognize scent days i smelled oils citrusy botanicals , bath water filled tiny bubbles i soaked my cold stress away . after bath i felt great , my skin bones felt refreshed i warm , cozy felt lot better . after looking it up online i really surprised see this called happy pill , because it really make me happy . i am really looking forward using other half , hopefully when i'm not sick anymore . once again lush came through me products they so lovingly create i cannot recommend their bath bombs enough . whether taken fun bath product or relieve cold or sadness they always work gentle relaxing ways . main ingredients this little love ball good skin nourishers such olive oil , hemp oil , grapefruit oil , bergamot oil , frankincense oil , lemon oil , grange flower absolute , mandarin oil , gardenia extract ( yum ! ) sodium bicarbonate . happy bathing ! - kasia .	1

unless you super oily skin cannot tolerate any super moisturizing potions , you shouldn't use this . i oily/normal skin find even this dry lotion moisturizing enough me . it definitely not dry skins or sensitive types . kinerase products touted their ultra sensitive ingredients , but beware , this lotion contains retinyl palmitate which fact irritate your skin . though this seem deliver some skin smoothing , it not my opinion , good cream version which much better balancing skin , not contain retinyl palmitate . both good , but kinerase cream better	1

what brilliant package ! it squeezebottle brush end , twist lid . no spills , no mess , no disaster . love it ! it easy apply brush . i lava flow , which shimmery pink . shimmer more obvious than i would like , it big flecks sparkle , but it isn't so bad it looks like glitter glue . there strong smell taste , sorta tropical ; although it isn't unpleasant , it powerful . kinda reminds me red koolaid . color bright pink when first applied , but simmers down medium pink rather sheer . container color looks unwearable , but reality it isn't dramatic . only drawback how sticky it feels . it less sticky than mac lipglass , but more so than urban decay xxx , if makes sense . i got this freebie i'm glad i got try it . i would buy it but different color	1
earlier i read all reviews retread . paying 20 bucks conditioner not quite suit me . however , i using it month now i say reviews inadequate discription product . personally , i believe this amazing product . i used it combination big i believe my hair never looked better . retread superb conditioner really wonders . i virgin hair , but i blow dry it ever day so i felt heavier conditioner necessary . since this deeper conditioner i would leave it 5-10 min or while you all your other stuff shower/bath . my hair softer than ever afterwards ( could big though ) shined like sun . this not everyday conditioner but works well once or twice week ( i mainly use it special occasions , or when i just want feel pretty ! ) i highly recommend it i feel it works much better than lush conditioning treatments . only issue smell . i am not much into smell cucumbers me what it smelled like . however , this could just personal attribute no one else mentioned this . product still amazing though , i am willing endure smell(it fades day goes ) . my decision this product miracle ! hope this helps !	1

this mascara great , it easy remove little warm water , but best thing it it won't give you ' racoon eyes ' . there no dis-coloration skin around eyes . it also keeps looking great all through day , no need re-apply i t.t he only reason i am not giving it 5 stars , even though they come different colors , they all look more black than colored when dry . so color doesn't stand out enough . still , i highly recommend it	1
just hint sheer red color , this lip balm tube one best i've tried . smell intoxicating , feel divine . what best me : 1 ) subtle shade red color , sheer but sexy , moisturizing but not greasy or gloppy 2 ) it lasts forever . i never before paid $10 tube lip balm , but i gladly it again . those wonder who it looks good : my opinion everybody ! i am dark-brown haired , light skinned , brown-eyed girl , no pink or rosy color my natural dead-white skin color/coloring . i burn easily freckle , too . my sister brownish-auburn-hair , medium-toned beige skin color hazel-brown eyes it looks great her , too . she tans easily . my niece blondish-brown haired , light brown eyes fair skin bit pink it tans easily . it looked great her , too . buy it enjoy it	1

orris root powder scent similar violets although this tisty tosty bath bomb , even addition rose oil , it not overpowering fragrance . i think they could add double rose oil , but you add rose ylang ylang if you mood . tisty tosty heart-shaped bath bomb perfect if you enjoy blending your own essential oils or prefer mild/calming bathing experience . i'd suggest using this one skin calming also adding " romance stone , " " sex bomb " or " chelsea garden " bath bomb add little more romance bath . i feel emotionally calm ( rose balances emotions ) my skin loved this bath bomb , but it not sensory i'd hoped . following this bath " it pleasure treasure massage bar " fun , also heart-shaped . you may want try " violet " soap this bathing experience . next time i try this , i might mix it " elixir " bath melt bit " bathos " bubble bar , also scented violet . far this magic spell , you just never know who might call you when you use this bath . probably right when you bath . so , if you think this work instantly , you might want keep phone tub . it funny , but when i bath , my husband trying call me said he let phone ring ring . he really think i would leave pleasure lush bath answer phone ? personally , i think they should scent this bath bomb like it pleasure treasure massage bar . it blissfully delicious almost seems edible - looks like white chocolate ( it mostly cocoa butter ) heady scent orange blossom honey neroli . ~ rebecca review	1

i've heard lots stories people using beer their hair i admit trying it once . cynthia sylvia stout much more pleasant experience beer blended fresh lemon juice , cognac oil lemon oil . it looks little like chocolate syrup i didn't think it very strong beer scent . strangely enough , scent sort reminds me freshly made whole wheat yeast dough ( perhaps hint lemon zest ) , which currently baking my bread baker . this very cleansing shampoo you might want use when your hair misbehaving needs little shine control . you may only need shampoo once since this really cleans well first time . using this veganese conditioner leave your hair feeling super clean not overly conditioned . if you want deeper conditioning experience , try american cream conditioner which simply intoxicating . please don't make me live without it ! while i enjoyed using cynthia sylvia stout shampoo , i still think my first love rehab shampoo ( scent rehab divine ) . this shampoo make my hair feel silky soft so i'll definitely buy it again . ~ rebecca review	1

this far most expensive relaxer i've ever used it worth every penny . i first heard it oprah relaxer so i decided hunt it down . one best things i've ever . i very coarse , thick " horsehair " usually defeats most over counter perms after few washings . not phytospecific relaxer . my hair stayed soft straight no matter what weather or i it . it healthiest it ever . no other relaxer ever my hair . fact they usually made it worse ! i absolutely love phytorelaxer i am officially addicted . if it less pricey , it would get 5 stars	1

this fragrance took me quite surprise when i first tried it magazine sample , so much so i knew i try it department store - this little over year ago . then i sampled it department store all my nose could think " wow ! " - gardenias my grandmother garden , suntan oils tropical perfumes i smelled little girl beach , few more florals blended make this fragrance even more exotic sensual - i knew i it ! i bought myself bathgel lotion set put large bottle cologne my x-mas list , which my sweet generous boyfriend got me . my opinion , this probably most alluring fragrance women i ever smelled . i feel very alluring every time i wear it my boyfriend - he loves it ! so this would great gift man wife or girlfriend , or woman best friend , sister or cousin ( long you wear it your own man , too ! ) , but slightly awkward gift give your mother , aunt or grandmother - it enticing . but if your single older relative or friend simply must it one her gifts , then it given one her female friends , sister , cousin or " santa " . way there won't any awkwardness gift-giving time . believe me - this fragrance olfactory equivalent french lingerie or string bikini !	1

well first off , i'm guy very short hair ... so i don't know whether or not it really works . but i'm bored decided rate it anyway . so here goes : consconditioner really thick difficult get out bottle . best solution this let bottle sit upside down . prossmells damn good . i'm not big fan fruity/coconut aromas , but i like this particular smell so much i might need go rehab sometime future . bottom line : although this conditioner difficult get out bottle , it smells really good . whether or not it work your hair , only way know try it . even if ot doesn't work your hair ... it worth 20 bucks just open it up smell it every now then . =)	1
this absolutely greatest shampoo ever ! i've abusing my hair least 30 years , i never my hair looking feeling healthy it now . there no better product your hair market . all others full damaging detergents chemicals dose silicone thrown make you think your hair clean , but you're killing it . i admire jonathan not treating us like idiots only shampoo doesn't tell you lather , shampoo , rinse twice , but you need . you need use no more than dime-size amount jonathan conditioner . my hair never looked or felt so good	1

i agree previous reviewer , smell candy like fragrance . i generally wear oscar or chloe , but this fragrance nice change . doesn't much staying power , though . it wears off fairly quickly . but it lovely scent .	1
i intrigued when i saw amazon.com also sold body products such perfume make up . how you review scent convince people purchase it ? i can't exactly post scratch sniff pad online . i say this one my all time favorite perfumes . it smells summery , light , fresh refreshing , somewhat like happy clinique . scent also lasts few hours , unlike some other cheaper perfumes . bonus packaging beautiful : perfume comes wrapped slender white box piece rice paper describes flowers few different languages .	1
i love this , so my husband . i bought entire kit which comes lovely satin mini duffel-like purse handle.it includes body creme , body wash , perfume.it bit strong introduction.it doesnt smell like pine-sol like others said . its like re-vamping original poison purple bottle . except this one sweeter crisper tone.it becomes light stays fresh time.id say its bit fruity/floral . good everyday or special night out .	1
i am my second bar this stuff now , wow-there so much i say it ! first smell honestly awesome second , after only week use , i got all these " baby " hairs cropping out over my head-this awesome me since , though i'm not currently loosing my hair , i strong family history hair loss ! i also very oily hair-the kind hair needs washed every day or i look like i'm homeless but after using this shampoo i skip day and-for first time my life-you can't tell it my condition my hair !! my only issue this even though my scalp oily , my ends dry i use just tiny bit cream conditioner it-also this item dissolves super quick if you leave it shower makes everything your shower pink ... but other than i strongly recommend this item anyone curious	1
this product really brighten your eyes when used eye powder , amazing ! worth money !	1
this scent bit softer than many men fragrances . it unique powdery scent . i like how it not too strong overbearing one spray . just enough so my girl smell it when she hugs me or sits next me . i also use acqua di gio it good contrast this scent . i get compliments both scents	1
i am one these people who hates make up , i am natural , but this yet clinique line i love love love . this almost lipstick great . it not leave nasty lipstick everywhere . it stays lips not my teeth , glass or my boyfriend . i love almost lipstick . it great	1
i'm true product junkie . i've tried more crap spent more money stuff my colored , processed , blow dried , ironed , wavy damaged weak hair then any sane human would ... but i think i finally found my soulmate product ... first i must say it smells divine like mocha coffee ... i use this product daily before bed every night morning after i towel dry my hair .. it only product i leave my hair after shower whether i wear it naturally wavy or blow dry it straight ... sometimes i add ojon gloss serum if i feel my hair needs it ... little goes long way , my past bottom bra thick hair uses size tablespoon ... since using this product 2 weeks my hair significantly shinier , softer , way less frizz , no more puff not porous.my color also looks more vibrant which great b/c it blonde getting brassy . i noticed results right after 1st treatment . i especially love it good your hair purchase contributions helps tribe central america who gather oil their trees . =) it pricey but worth every cent then some . you can't put price true beauty right	1

very good product . i am allergic many make up products , but this one i not any problems . very satisfied !	1
i absolutely love clinique eye shadow . all their eye shadows go so smooth , never crease , just perfect shades colors my skin tone . almost peach color great because i use it highlighter under my brow or just base , either way i use it just every day ! :	1
within two days using this cream , i waa astonished results ! my skin tone completely evened out , my skin appeared smoother than it ever my life . it add glow . i'm not so sure tha it really works eliminating wrinkles , but other effects well worth every penny	1
this shower gel works really well -- you use it general soap , it very mild , so you use it anywhere ( ah hem .. ) your body without it stinging , or burning . i haven't tried it shampoo . works quite well shaving . good consistency . smells exactly like fresh banana . more fruity banana scent , like tropical lifesaver , than baked banana bread scent , if helps any . pricewise , this actually one more affordable upscale shower gels per ounce , assuming you buy large bottle just one scent . also , this stuff preserves very well . i still some philosophy eggnogg (!) shower gel i bought holidays , i now used it through 2 christmases it still smells great ..	1
clinique products , key knowing your skin type . i took quiz [ ... ] order decide which products buy 3step system results showed clarifying lotion #2 appropriate option . i little worried when i read reviews amazon.com said it too strong given some individuals rashes , but i used it anyway . it works beautifully . if you buy this lotion get rash or breakout it because you didn't consult clinique source or unaware your true skin type . so long you buy right products you , it going everything it promises more ... i highly recommend it	1
daring provocative , enigmatic mysterious , delicious perfume much say . dazzling its spicy heart notes , karan message seductive perhaps even troubling . way go donna karan ! 5 stars you	1
finally i found delicious , light , everyday scent . not heavy or over-powering , this refreshing apple scent great any day .	1
best i've ever used . little burn , very efficient . love this stuff	1
this purchased gift my son 14-yr-old girlfriend valentine day . heart shape container , well nice color lip gloss made it perfect gift her	1
it probably smaller than one inch cube so it isn't whole lot gloss , but key chain so it can't too big . very cute	1
this classic fragrance , not your overpowering j-lo , b'spears , etc . i wish i could explain scent ... but it tough describe . it isn't fruity or flowery . perhaps bit lavendar though ? basically , you don't overpower room it . it bit " old-world " -ness it ... but far i am concerned , wonderful thing . i am 31 year old professional , i wear it daily out night , i just love it	1
i bought this product three weeks ago i seen great improvements my skin already . i never really used skin products but i living florida over 20 years i lot spots due sun damage . friend mine told me this product his wife bought him . so , i decided give it try it really shown great results ! spots my skin diminishing my face looks better . i decided try some other menscience products . my wife also started using product , so you may buy two	1
i tried this lush store bellevue , i didn't like how it felt first because it felt greasy me but i soon realized i used too much , it doesn't take much . i got free sample after purchasing other products there my skin very dry because i am diuretic , this helping my hands bunch i suprised because i small cut my finger skin drying out around it catching my clothes other things . within two days useing product dry skin cleared up cut healed almost no mark all ! i love mild , clean smell soft feel	1

i received this lip gloss few years ago christmas present , then i couldn't find it forgot it . but friend mine this using this same lip gloss couple weeks ago i remembered how great it . this one best lip glosses/balms i've ever used . flavor fantastic moisture it gives your lips unbeatable . it not sticky , it not even really noticeable . it very " natural beauty " if you know what i mean . :	1
i extremely oily skin . it wasn't unusual me wash my face three four times day keep it shining . result oily skin humid temps ( i live . georgia ) , makeup would just slide down my face i'd end up feeling like i stuck my head crisco end day . friend suggested clinique though oil isn't completely gone ... which wouldn't desireable anyways ... it finally manageable . i got ddm lotion part three step program clinique offers , but i think lotion solely responsible changes my skin . i could leave or take toner soap , which don't seem any different than less expensive versions readily available drugstores . lotion though ... wow ! it doesn't go greasy or watery . instead , it nice light consistency easy smooth over your skin but thick enough it not hard contain or control your fingertips . soon you rub it , you notice mattifying properties . lotion actually helps reduce shine itself , but without any tightness or depriving your skin its moisture . some stuff i've tried past only dried my skin out temporarily then oil glands would really start kick vengence , but this lotion i haven't any those problems . my skin now smoother than it ever , oil glands apparently appeased well because i haven't wash my face middle afternoons anymore .	1
this product really apply like butter very rich moisturizers . i using it years giving it christmas gifts . i use it very rich treatment dry legs , heels , elbows . i love fresh mango fragrance . before bed , i often cover my feet mango body butter , slip socks , let good stuff soak overnight . then i feel very pampered i wake up soft feet	1
it seems no one escape . there times when even best tressed need help their hair . sun , sand , surf may leave you many happy memories , but it also leave hair looking like ... well , let not talk it . perms , coloring , all intended make us look better - let face it , sometimes leave hair dry lusterless . time get serious shea butter . frederic fekkai moisturizing conditioner shea butter rich , creamy healing potion less than healthy locks . it truly hydrates , smells delicious , nourishes damaged hair . if your hair thick , it also marvelous detangler . only small amount needed - simply apply after shampooing comb through . what difference fekkai makes	1
i am believer now . i bought this because i saw demonstration qvc . i really needed great scrub since i use spray tan great exfloliator helps . i'm not sure what amazing grace really smells like , but i liked this smell . its not over-powering not over-perfumed . its got nice clean smell . i bottle expensive peter thomas roth scrub but find philosophy brand actually holds together you feel scrub . there no dripping . this truly great rough exfoliator . warming sensation , i didnt feel it . buy it sephora where you return it if you're not satisfied .	1
i alittle hesitant first ... this my first lush experience , but soon well rewarded . i thick , curly , long color treated hair . so say its damaged understatement . hybrid worked major tho . i doesnt lather like your normal shampoo , so i concerned if it really working . it ... no fear . i use quiet few swips tho , because how much hair i - but still - ive this bar month now , barely see where its used . i store mine traveling soap case always let dry before closing dont store shower . i still need condition afterwards , but not much normally . when dry ... my hair just feels healthier less frizzy , but not caked down .	1

love all items laura mercier spring collection - sheer madness . " sheer " operative word here - makeup subtle , refined very flattering . stick gloss rates ten all a me . what not like lip treatment soothes , smooths , plus adds color fullness ? stick gloss combination lip balm , lip color , lip glaze - three one winner . my favorite colors peony , deep rose , poppy , festive crimson . when applied each color much sheerer than tube color indicates . instance , peony appears burgundy tone yet lips it lovely rose . perfect warm weather tones .	1
i've used others past , but they end up losing their concealment power short time , or end up making me look shinier . this one easy apply ( it like drawing your face ) it stays long time . i really love it . :	1

i've got pretty oily skin - i always . these my absolute favorite oil blotting sheets . i've tried wide assortment other brands , shiseido ones truly best . i really like light powder sheets . you know it absorbing without leaving tons make-up left your face . i detest those oil blotting sheets which " rubbery " . hopefully you know what i'm referrring . i don't feel like those sheets actually absorb anything - more like push oil around . after using this product you visably see all oil grime removed your face . i haven't found anything i like better than these . 5 stars	1
burberry london definitely compliment-getter . it also versatile , it worn any weather any outfit . it notes peach , black currant , vanilla , cedar . please not judge this scent only sniffing nozzle or smelling scent strip paper . it smells nothing like it skin . allow it settle 5 minutes , if it works your body chemistry , you'll know right away . :o ) first sprtiz , i get peachy/cedar blast quickly mellows into gorgeous , clean , but warm scent . vanilla isn't sweet all .. just warm inviting . i received lot compliments this . lasting power wonderful ! end day , it only sniffed anyone who gets close you , but it developed into super soft , clean vanilla . burberry london expensive , but there lots places where you find great deals it . bottle very sophisticated , simple , classy . try it !	1
i ash brown hair few blonde highlights found dark blonde/medium brown color very natural . i used sephora slanted eyeshadow brush apply very happy results . it so much better than lancome pencil i used use	1
i'm so glad finally came out this gloss . my sister got this gift set . i wanted my own ( just gloss ) i got it off ebay . this gloss smells like chocolate , color subtle , it makes your lips tingle . color doesn't last long i would like but my lips look great dolly they soft when i'm not using this	1
i purchased this conditioner after used fekkai color-treated ( pink one ) version thinking it would even better my high-lighted damaged hair . while it still fantastic conditioner compared most market , i really thought pink one better job . both leave my hair smooth relatively healthy , but my hair honestly gorgeous after using pink fekkai conditioner -- shiny , bouncy , like i never colored it . maybe this one little too heavy my hair ? i haven't quite figured out difference . previous posters noted , this rather strong smell -- sort floral , almond fragrance -- which little stronger than most hair products . i didn't find it particually off-putting , but i prefer clean , simple fragrance pink fekkai conditioner . all all , great product , but i'll go back my original fekkai conditioner when this one runs out . i never thought i would say this $20 tiny bottle conditioner , but it totally worth $$ . ( comparison purposes , i medium-length , straight , dirty blonde hair highlights )	1
i bought this my boyfriend , he thinning hair he said it made his hair feel thicker more attached . i love smell , i contstantly sniff his head now . also shipping really fast	1
i absolutely love this stuff ! i purchased it bare minerals starter kit ( foundation powders w/ dvd all ) because i wanted some color add foundation . i think it worth your money - actually you would save money rather than buying all items separately . it nice you get your eye , cheek lip products all one kit . i particularly like buxom lips stuff can't get enough it ! it so minty , tingly leaves light shimmer . clear radiance great ! i use it blusher , if i wet it it makes great eye shadow base . eyeshadow brush fabulous ! i like how there two ends - one eyeliner , other shadow , although i also use eyeliner brush eyeshadow . gold glimmer great if you wet it comes stronger . my only concern it get messy - particularly onyx color which comes strong so only use very little . otherwise i think it great buy !	1
despite what britney spears might mean you , this one sexy perfume . it smells hot . all girls should wear this	1

yes , this just water , but packaged wonderfully . i very dry , sensitive skin , little evian spritzers ( i carry one me all time winter ) help immeasurably . i spray little before moisturizing , or when my skin flaking . i always take these planes -- spritz my face every two hours -- find this keeps my skin drying out becoming too oily ( reaction dryness ) long flights . some reviewers scoffed this product , pointing out it just water speculating brand name draw . i don't drink evian water very often ( i prefer other brands , if i'm drinking bottled water ) , if i could find comparable product i would definitely try it out . similar products , like body shop face mists , tend scented irritate my ( very sensitive ) skin ( exception this face spritz boots botanical line , but hard find outside uk ); i've considered just getting spray bottle putting regular water it , but those tend larger , more forceful sprayers i don't want point one my face . evian brumisateur , you're getting just water , but that all you need ; it conveniently packaged , lasts long time such small bottle , i love way it feels . highly reccomended ( thank goodness they're carry-on approved , if you buy small size !	1
i love this fragrance but even when i layer falling love body wash , body lotion perfume spray , it seem fade lot faster than other perfumes . falling love really great scent so when i wear it - i continue refresh scent occasional spritz throughout day .	1

clinique " pore minimizer instant perfector " indeed change appearance your skin . it incredibly light , just touch glides your pores disappear instant . you wear it alone or under regular make-up even more coverage . i really think this great product it just what it says it . i recommend you use it no more than light moisturizer or else it won't able get your pores work its magic	1

this first foundation i ever bought actually matched my skin color exactly . i seriously can't see it all my skin ! it goes velvety smooth isn't greasy all , after minute or two , it feels totally natural , soft matte finish . i don't even use powder it set it . my only complaint very light sheer , so it doesn't really cover up lot flaws ( i freckles around my mouth it doesn't cover ) , but it works fine little concealer . i haven't noticed much way line reduction all , either , i'm sorry say . but still good foundation itself	1
i usually add salts bath oil my baths well bubbles add skin softening properties .... but this bubble bar , i don't !! it pink , it smells so good , water bubbles feel so soft against my skin !! i absolutely love this one ~ i tried many , lush brand others ~ so much i got rock star soap matching scent . i say , however , i found it necessary keep it fridge during summer months although it arrives solid-i live florida so humidity makes it soften bit more than i'd like cabinet . overall ? 20 stars !	1

most masks made clay seem dry out so fast you hardly time put them your face before you need wash them off . they also only seem serve one purpose , drying out your skin or removing oil . there some leave your face feeling nourished this one healing clay masks . i sensitive skin tendancy towards either dry or oily - guess it lovely combination skin problem . so , this mask seems deal both issues once - removing dry skin deeply cleansing pores . mask magnaminty made bentonite , water , kaolin , honey , phaseolus angularis seed powder , evening primrose seeds , peppermint oil , flower extracts , vanilla fruit extract chlorphyllin-copper complex . this fun use bath or shower while you shaving . put it few minutes , let it dry slightly then rub off dead skin cells . seeds provide exfoliating power . almost immediately upon looking mirror after leaving tub , i could tell this mask healing powers . dreamwash , my skin looked especially cleansed calmed . i recommend both you if you need skin brightening calming . these two products seemed work well together create radiant complexion . you may also want try prince shaving cream dream bath bomb . figs leaves soap also very moisturizing . ~ rebecca review p.s. if you find someone rub this all over your back , it feels so good easy wash off yourself later ( unlike some clay masks i've tried ) .	1
i bought this lush product due high reviews other lushies couldn't wait get home try it . when i opened pot , first thing i noticed color - it little turn-offish , but don't let stop you slathering your entire face it . smell amazing not too minty or strong . like previous review said below , it smells like mint chocolate chip ice cream . i put mask all over my face ( you put it your neck back well ) , lie down 15 minutes get full spa feel , then wash it off shower warm water . i find it much easier shower because when mask dries , it takes some rubbing get it off . when mask , your face tingles mint feels so refreshing ! when mask rinsed off , your skin feels even better . great cleanser exfoliator one ! sure keep eye out ' best ' date because this only shelf life 4 months	1

you use it putting little metal loop around blemish , then sort gently pushing raking it one direction . good extracting white-heads or soon-to-be white heads . if i buy it all over again , i'd probably go one " lance " or little pin one end instead blackhead extractor , sine side fairly useless	1

i thought this kit steal since it credible brand it included all basic needs i use everyday extremely reasonable price . i don't use lip gloss much others because me , colors lip gloss don't match natural look im going . all other products out this world though , they very light liquid powder like none ive seen before . you put it underneath or final layer both work . i definitely recommend this kit because it works every skin tone .	1

this day-time fragrance i can't live without . i'm type person who doesn't like things smelling too florally or girly-girl ( e.g paris hilton or maria sharpova fragrances , which don't suit me all ) . same time , i don't want something that too " mature " leaving me smelling like old lady ( too strong musky ) . eau des merveilles somewhat in-between fragrance that hard describe very unusual . it woodsy but it amber , pepper , citris notes . it refreshing , modern , chic . you don't need overspay this stuff either . it potent you'll probably mistaken wearing cologne if you overkill it . people like how i smell this fragrance , some even say i smell like " clean laundry , " which good thing ( me atleast ) . you should try this stuff sephora or fragrance dealer before buying it though . people body chemistrys ( amount perspiration , oil production , foods they eat , etc . ) make perfumes smell differently . spray it seell it after few hours .	1

other person who reviewed " happy " clinique incorrect . there no musk undertone this perfume . i know because my body chemistry brings out musky undertones any fragrance whatsoever , regardless if it maybe perfume , body spray , lotions , whatever . instead this fragrance light flowery citrus undertones . additionally , scent lasts all evening . i put light spray beginning evening , go smoky club punk rock band , drink , get fight , roll hay still smell like happy morning !	1

i fekkai product , loved it so much i wanted take look what else dear frederic offer . i've always wanted product would put waves my hair , but every one i tried before just made my hair stiff , crunchy , icky looking ! i read good reviews this product , so i decided give it try . it amazed me ! my hair really doesn't much natural wave- maybe one or two semi-waves back . frankly , if i leave my hair air-dry without doing anything it , it looks like cave-woman hair ! but not this stuff ! i towel dried my hair until it just damp . then i sprayed it all over my hair , flipped my head over scrunched . ( if your hair tends get frizzy , you may want add little cream- such fekkai glossing cream- this product doesn't much combat frizz ) then i blow-dryed low just minute or two while scrunching , let rest air-dry . i few pieces hair front quite damaged coloring , waves weren't defined there . but rest my hair- wow ! i never imagined such fun waves my relatively straight hair ! frederic fekkai genius !	1

i skeptical first . i mean , shampoo/conditioner bar ? i haven't super impressed lush other solid shampoos or conditioners ( least , not enough write review , good or bad ) , so i doubtful this 2-in-1 bar . but i loved idea , i curious , so i bought it i must say godiva far surpassed my hopes ! my hair shoulder length , it only took 6 or 7 good swipes wet hair work up incredible lather ! ( 3 or 4 swipes wasn't enough , 10 too much ! )my hair felt clean , but not styrofoam-squeaky clean where * everything * stripped your hair . conditioner light , but doesn't really kick until your hair dries . i don't personnally recommend using hair dryer , so i don't know how would affect conditioner , but air drying worked great me . i also recommend it travel since it size your palm , 2-in-1 , won't leak ! ( only warning i'd give shampoo tin . i got it free , so maybe i shouldn't complain , but ... let shampoo bar dry before putting it into tin !!! it pain get it out if you don't . ) i also love scent , but could too strong some people ( or not strong enough ) . everyone different , but if you don't live near lush store , you'll never know until you buy it ! :	1
i don't know why so many reviews say they get six or seven shaves . aren't you using hot shaving soap ? i average european beard . i shave shower each day mug soap bristle brush . key . i get good hot lather going . lather just keep your whiskers wet soft . using merkur blade , i get well over fifteen or twenty shaves .... or more . i don't really keep count , but one blade lasts me least four weeks , i shave daily . i reluctantly change blades when it seems it bit dull .. but i think i could use it much longer ... honest . i can't imagine spending three dollars multiblade razor good seven days . love my merkur razor , too	1
fragrances marvelous , yet after shower they not interfere your scent choice . i find shower gel very creamy not drying all . i use it well shampoo , but found dry harsh winter i still need conditioner . i highly recommend this product	1
entire line fabulous , but rose zircon lip gloss far best . i never one wear lipstick , but since i first tried this lip plumping gloss , i rearly leave home without it . it doesn't feel like you wearing anything , yet it stays while eating drinking . rose zircon matches my lips all my friends who borrowed it not returned it because they love it so . it just makes me feel glamorous	1

i stated my other reviews , i color-treated otherwise normal hair which wavy prone frizz . i like this shampoo it calming effect , best experienced after couple uses . if you straighten your hair , this work great because shine smoothness most noticable . those you worried your boss may think you spent your lunch break pub - stout scent fades quick only really identifyable while washing . word wise , this shampoo bit drying . i make sure deep condition least once week avoid crispy hair .	1

this stuff goes easy , stays well ( but rub off water , won't withstand good cry ) . nice . not quite nice victoria secret liner ( i swear stuff , discontinued 3-4 years ago ) , but way better than anything cheaper . i tried other things . plus , won't irritate my very sensitive eyes	1
i received smaple size this face creme my recent order my hunny anniversary present estee lauder . it came bunch other stuff i either swapped or gave away , but this real winner me . it came 5-day supply , i just wish i more . i used this creme supplement other lotions i wasn't thrilled , namely , neutrogena whip moisturizer spf 15 or 30 , clinique super city block spf 40(but i'm still undecided this one ) . both these weren't smooth enough . they didn't nice slip spread easily across skin . former i use lot its owen really moisturize lower half my face , latter i rub very hard order get it spread without this creme . i love this creme gets job . out all moisturizers i used my face , i use this one most sparingly order moisturize , i like . i imagine it coests more than other two moisturizers , but it also better job . i don't like when i first put it , it seems warm up my face bit around nose mouth . ordinarily this wouldn't bother me , but seeing how almost every other thing breaking me out recently , it makes me teensy bit paranoid . howver , this sensation not persist , so i don't worry too much it . other thing it takes alittle longer sink into skin , until it , it gives my skin look if i sweating , but then it my skin just feels good . isn't what moisture all ? recommended : yes amount paid ( us$) : gwpskin compatibility : improved my skinfragrance : pleasing scent	1
i'm usually drugstore mascara girl -- my current fave maybelline full soft -- but i opportunity pick this up cheap , so i decided try it . immediately , i liked thinner-sized tube ( can't stand those overly fat mascaras ! ) stiff-bristled brush . product bit dry side , but i much prefer wet gloppy . there wasn't too much product brush , it easy apply . i definitely noticed lengthening effect beyond what i've seen any other mascara , which great because it made my small eyes look much more open . also , product stayed put all day long , absolutely no smudging or flaking . my only slight disappointment it left my lashes looking bit thin , effect long spidery ; i guess i'm used fullness i get my everyday mascara , full soft . i continue use definicils times when i particularly want more length , i've found i layer it my full soft get both length fullness i want . i would repurchase this if i could get it discount again , but i would not pay full price	1
deep clover votiva nicest aroma any candle i sampled . it not over-powering yet it job . it warm , sensual fragrance	1
i don't know what i would without this mascara !! this mascara me beyond best i ever used , ( i my share investments other brands mascara only sadly disappointed ) . i would give this product 10 stars if amazon would let me . i confess i carry this mascara me everywhere ( not you re-touch up during day -- because you dont , but just so i won't ever lose it ) . truly product worth trying .	1
i got this my boyfriend , who works all day lifting heavy plants nursery . he loved it minute i applied it his sore back . smell calming , spices warm up sore muscles like icy-hot patch , but much better . it melts easily into skin , but lasts long time . it feels so creamy warm . now he always begs me give him massage	1
i bought solution 2 roller ball it works very well . refill amazing deal i love this product	1
normally our house , we threaten wash cats ( they don't like water too much normally only peer curiously into bathroom when i'm tub . now then they played bubbles ) , but this amusing name . i think it more like " honey , i lost soap tub again . " this one melting dream soap easily slip away into depths luxurious lush bath . this soap good think pink bath bomb some creamy candy bath bubble bar . if you love this , you may simply faint when you order sultana soap ( oh my ! ) . avowash ( avocado olive oil ) , ooh la la ( lavender ) bohemian ( lemon ) also fun . ~ rebecca review	1
loved scent feel this soap ! i'm bath product junkie my latest cravings anything honey scented this soap wonderful . my only complaint it use up pretty quickly left mess dish . i'd not leave it shower next time .	1
if you tried such products proactiv help clear up your breakouts haven't impressed , try this line murad products .

essie protein base coat two steps one while you giving yourself manicure or pedicure ( or taking these salon - good idea because they better than other polishes dry faster ! ) , you notice how this smoothes out your nails prepares them perfect nail polish finish . this formula contains camphor , silica collagen healthy , strong flexible nails . nail polishes also go perfectly there so many colors choose !	1
new estee lauder lipsticks seems very moisturizing smooth this lip liner helps keep your pouty look all place . lipstick alone not give you well defined lips this liner really takes look 5 10 . you apply it before or after you apply lipstick it works equally well . if you find cognac shade , it goes very well sumptuous lipstick . ~ rebecca review	1
my mother bought this perfume me two christmases ago . first i thought it too heavy . however , once i started wearing it i fell love it . i've never received so many compliments perfume my life . men women randomly stop me hallways , restaurants , street ti ask me what i am wearing . " you smell so good ... " i wear it everyday now am my third bottle .	1
every time i wear amor amor lots people ask me what i'm wearing . it my absolute favorite fragrance i got great deal it . thanks , annett	1
so true this product . i admit when i first saw price tag this product , it half out curiousity i purchased . i mean could pair $20 tweezers much better than ole $1.75 or $3 pairs home ? well if your asking yourself question , yes ! these things amazing grip pull tinyiest hairs . things you would dig normal tweezers until you finally rub your skin raw . without doubt , you get your moneys worth this product well amazed their performance . it type " wow " makes you feel like , " how i ever get without these before " . worth every penny i'll never buy cheap tweezer again . these lasted years still retain their fine point .	1
tweezerman really best tweezers market say , cutest . different colors choose , fact they're reliable strong only adds them . tweezers gone dull you need them sharpened ? you don't need go store anymore buy new ones . tweezerman sharpens them free charge sh so long you send envelope . my final point : i don't see point buying any other tweezer since you buy one pair it lasts you rest your life	1
i am definitely beauty junkie . i tried probably every volumizing product market ( including much lauded phyto volumizer ) but i absolutely love love love this kerastase product so much ! it far best ! it leaves your hair silky smooth tons volume ( even after blowdrying it 15 minutes ) . it doesn't leave behind gummy or sticky residue . it little expensive but it lot bang its buck i would even pay more it if i . i never use anything else again !	1
i really long hair i use lot conditioner . this good treatment winter when my naturally blonde hair starts grow out bit darker than my summer haircolor . it doesn't lighten hair very dramatically all its own , but it conditions very well smells really nice , like lemony custard . i use this warming it slightly microwave so it sinks better , then applying it dry hair . i tie my hair into bun wait twenty minutes or so , then rinse it gently , wash my hair using blonde shampoo , condition light conditioner . if you don't really want your hair lightened much just want bit extra shine highlight your blonde hair , this great its own . if you want more dramatic effect , blonde solid conditioner works stronger effect . blonde drying though so i like use them together	1
it delightful remind spring , daises true love during cold dreary winter months . i love using this set while traveling , bring back home memories make it easier away .	1
i've fan roger et gallet soap ever since i went paris late 1970 . products world class just thing make one feel like king	1

i rabid fan lush products years , often them shipped me form canada before they so easy buy states . each product certain earthy quality it its nice knowing people who make each every single these luscious concoctions love them much customers it shows ! karma soap looks like slab gold shape but really reminiscent candied carrots i would find fruit cakes i used eat kid growing up poland . clarity fiery jewel like color quite attractive it makes nice soap put guest bathroom or self spoiling hand made soaps beat other cookie cutter types mile . scent itself breezy breath citrus mother earth embedded deep core . lavender patchouli whisper , shadowy backbone zest freshness . multidimensionality layering scents makes fore very uplifting experience i smell heady aromas every time i my hands it . i also love karma perfume , which smells almost exactly soap . i find my hands don't get dry when i use this glycerin soap opposed regular soaps laden chemicals lards . but i always use hand cream afterwards , preferably one those gooey burt bees creams come heavy glass jars . my hands never crack or get dry no matter how dry air or how cold it when i used lush soaps good hand cream . - kasia .	1

all i say wow . i'm 24 . my first razor same kind de razor my dad used ( some gillette ) . around 17 mach 3 came out since full knowledge shaving never really handed down me , i opted mach 3 which easy use gave decent shave . i've essentially stuck mach 3 until now , but generally unsatisfied closeness my shave i decided investigate turned back safety razor picking up this merkur hd . i just used it first time it turned out significantly more satisfying than i hoped it would . i nicked myself few times without really noticing so there some learning curve but now i've only used it once i tell you it won't take long get it down . couple thoughts : 1 ) i'm really glad i went hd . i thought hd may heavy ( it may compared other de razors ) but i wouldn't want it any lighter . it already feels light my hand . 2 ) biggest thing keep mind shave razor cuts keeping it perpendicular your skin . most notable difference shaving mach 3 . merkur hd centered around this . mach 3 i kind feel like i drag blade across my skin ( kind scraping it ) get close shave ( which i don't notice much irritation ) . said most shave hd close , but since aim keep blade perpendicular , razor felt more like it gliding over skin . very nice . 3 ) put new blade you unscrew bottom top part comes off . you pop blade , put top back screw bottom tighten top . it should noted i've started shaving night so i tell what i'm doing ( i'm not morning person ) so morning if i'm not really going pay attention mach 3 may still better . also , i'm using cheap soap boar brush cvs until stuff i ordered comes so any luck it even nicer next time	1

i've only used this twice so far ( last night this morning ) but already i've noticed my skin not oily it really soft after i rinse it off . i'm intrigued entire lush product line - glad i stumbled upon this . i've got some samples way ( won off auction site ) i can't wait try them . also , this seller awesome when ups some reason thought i moved . when i called lush live person answered phone called ups me . ups called me within 30 minutes offered bring it out night . wonderful !! my skin oily lg pores blackheads - go ahead give this try if this sounds like your skin . only drawback it little messy side but not too bad	1
i dont know what they put it , i just know it works . within three days getting this product chicago lush store , my face cleared up beautifuly . i've really awful skin , blackheads , whiteheads , deep cystic acne , since i around 14 , i've tried anything i could get my hands take care it ( proactive , everything else ) i problem finding product would clean up my super oily skin without irritating it because its very very sensitive . this trick beautifuly ( followed up some celestial mosturizer after some hardcore exfoliation ) made my face feel very soft smooth after washing instead all itchy flakey . my pores also looked noticably smaller well . plus it smells great	1
this super-rich bath those very dry skin . melt basically oils , luscious scent , some soaping or foaming agents make oils disperse into bathwater not float top like they would otherwise . it sometimes little too rich my skin , but i love scent so i use it occasionally anyway just rinse off afterwards some rock star soap . scent lovely rock star scent , vanilla-y candy scent kids also love .	1
i can't describe how incredibly clean my face feels after using just one pad . i use one every night before bed , my skin noticeably clearer	1
while sephora looking new nars lipstick , pretty dior rep approached me . i would normally declined her offer mini-make-over , but i feeling rather adventurous wanted update some my make-up items , so i followed her her chair where she went work me . i say , past , i nonplussed unimpressed makeovers like these . but when rep handed me mirror , i gasped . even under harsh lighting , my complexion looked pretty darn flawless youthful grandmother trying hold any vestige good looks . i bought foundation , finishing powder few other dior goodies . i figured i would probably use it few times realize it didn't really look good me home or office it when dior rep my makeup store . then i would experience buyer remorse continue my quest perfect foundation . lucky me , i wrong . this product become one my top choices foundation . it doesn't settle fine lines around my eyes , or my pores . instead , it what it says -- smooths out my complexion . color chosen me looks natural no lines demarcation . coverage what i prefer this stage my life . i gave it 4 stars instead 5 because i am still searching this type lush coverage gives my combo skin less shine mid-day . but now , i finish using bottle , probably purchase , which something i haven't other foundations some time . my biggest tip this foundation little goes long way . dior rep used make-up brush tends give more sheer , even coverage . $50 , it wouldn't seem bargain , but if you use it i've described , it should last you several months .	1

i pretty honest - i excited get this kit , but so far i've disappointed . maybe i'm not getting whole technique down , but i find diagrams pretty generalized powder flakes everywhere it isn't supposed ( like under my eyes , making them look very raccoon-y tired -- when wearing smoky eyes , i figure you probably want everything else look pretty bright comparison dramatic eye effect ) . maybe i can't pull look or maybe i'm not applying it correctly , but either way , it always ends up looking like big , dark , glittery mess ... i'm big bare escentuals lover , but i disappointed this product .	-1
i enjoyed using this product because i liked tingling mint - not necessarily good thing , actually rather meaningless appearance cleanliness my face . kaolin bentonite drying agents , peppermint harsh sensitive skin . if you separate out so-called natural ingredients , you left same basic stuff any other cosmetics company uses . if it doesn't come straight out ground , it ain't natural anymore ! i give it 2 because i sucker tingling , not because i saw any improvement my skin texture , look , or feel	-1

i ordered this fun since decided it definitely not me any way . it very drying my skin , even though it thick creamy . label says it award-winning , but doesn't state what award it received ( if any ! ) . i fail see what might warrant it award-winning . scent smells like plastic or cheap strawberry candy . also , it absurdly priced given quality . i've tried few philosophy items need just stop buying them because i'm always disappointed .	-1
i bought this hoping i would look good get my face cleaned . no lie , this soap makes you look uglier than you really . so unless you wanna smell little weird not look your best , dont buy this soap ! im serious !	-1
i purchased this shampoo my daughter after she read rave reviews teen magazine . she thick , blonde hair it dry summer heat , pool water , light styling . after trying rehab shampoo , she so disappointed it nothing help her hair . she said while it lathered nicely , it felt like it stripped her hair when it rinsed out , it left her hair overly ' squeeky ' tangled . end result once her hair dried ( after using conditioner , too ) , it lighter shade blonde , very fly-away , dry feeling . she hoping smoother , easier manage hair . we debated purchasing this shampoo because its high cost , i say we extremely disappointed . claims hype , results not delivered . her hair no means ' fried ' or severely damaged , so i fully expected her some more manageable locks after using product , based its claims . i say i bought her shampoo condition drug store helped dramatically . it thermasilk smooth silky line , it works wonders over rehab fraction cost . save your money this one	-1
i noticable undereye cirlces bought this product hopes it you lighten them bit . i use this product mornings evenings several weeks . nothing changed . i figured maybe it would take more then few weeks notice anything so i continued use this product ( use entire jar , just give it plenty time ) , still not difference could seen . me it waste money .	-1
one my former roommates used kerastase nutritive shampoo very dry hair . i remember it smelling great endorsed celebrities " it " shampoo treating dry , unruly tresses . other day , i saw this shampoo clearance shelf meijers regrettably made impulse purchase . even clearance price , this shampoo still expensive . i very thick , wavy , somewhat dry hair needs lots conditioning products -- when i checked out ingredients ( after i bought shampoo ) , i groaned inwardly . almost all ingredients ( exception water ) aubrey organics ' " ingredients avoided " list ( , they considered toxic ) . like aubrey organics , other reputable natural beauty manufacturers suggest avoiding parabens preservatives because they mildly estrogenic absorbed through skin . this shampoo six different types parabens -- methyl , ethyl , propyl , etc . if product such steep asking price , then you would think its manufacturers would put forth better formula , incorporating non-toxic , natural ingredients ( like aveda , biolage , biosilk ) . least suave v05 ( bargain-priced shampoos ) boast vitamins silk amino acids their formulas ( though many their other ingredients also found " avoided " list ) .	-1
i wasn't really thrilled this product . it smells great but soon shower over thrill gone	-1
this , hands down , worst perfume i ever smelled . if you're mood smell sexy , don't wear this . if you're mood smell girlish , don't wear this . if you're mood smell classy , don't wear this . other words , i no idea what kind mood you actually want wear this . i literally went around work asking twenty coworkers what they thought , they all agreed this awful . only person i imagine wearing this senior citizen . it just smells terrible drab .. it wasn't i got bad bottle either , i've smelled it stores it same . truly terrible	-1
my experience : i heard such great things prevage - restores youthful skin , reverses damage , etc ., i couldn't wait until it available . finally , i able buy it - nice packaging , great dispenser just right amount . after two months , i found it only great under makeup moisterizer , there plenty others equal efficacy 1/10 price - eucerin , instance . kinerase nothing me either , so it may just me - just fyi - fair , sensitive dry skin , middle aged .	-1
front material cheap feeling grainy . also , there large plastic gold-colored cris notti button adorning front not appear online picture . otherwise it functionally useful good quality	-1
these very well made shears - but they arrived dull , unable cut hair . after additional 6$ sharpening they work fine	-1
i still got marks . iwish it helped . i used it while after giving birth but it didn't help .	-1
i tried this mascara expecting great things but very disappointed . mascara seemed dry it took too long apply enough so it even looked like i lashes ( my natural lashes almost clear ) . back drawing board looking holy grail mascara	-1
me , it barely looked like i mascara all . i blonde eyelashes , so even adding color usually makes my eyes pop , this didn't really . i ended up giving it my mom , thinking maybe it just me since so many others loved it , she didn't like it either . it ended up garbage . i've loved dior show mascara course , great lash . i'd recommend those over this , especially money	-1
this product absolutely nothing . it made my face look even more queasy dry same time . save your money	-1
i thought this tea . holy [ ... ] i surprise ? anyone else think this tea ? it [ ... ] i couldn't get taste out my mouth four weeks	-1

so , i've owned tweezerman extractor before , i am now questioning why i didnt go my instinct just stick familiar ... this extractor no help what so ever . loop hole entirely too small it would complete utter chance i would press right pore . its just too small even target . lance helpful blackheads but it really sharp if youre not careful , you could damage your skin . i would recommend not buying this extractor . i would much rather preferred sticking tweezerman ..	-1
i purchased this item recommendation make-up sales representative nordstrom . i less than pleased product . i used entire container saw no benefit !!	-1
listen up !!! ... l'occitane shea 24 hour ultra rich face cream 1.7 ounce- same moisturizing results- fraction cost !!! - :)	-1
i didn't care it . it smelled good but that only good thing i say . it neither helped or harmed my hair . i don't think i would buy it again	-1
what point this mascara when half container doesn't what it supposed ? black mascara not good quality -- it comes off very quickly . part problem may brush simply too tiny -- larger brushes far superior when it comes applying mascara . silver stuff -- only reason someone would seek out this product -- all but invisible lashes regardless how many times you go over your lashes wand .	-1
my sister-in-law bought this product me after i admired shade ( purr , light baby pink color ) she wearing . i used other mac products before great results , but very dissapointed this product . first all , i gave this product one star because shade look very pretty lips went very well my skin coloring . however , this product sticky . very sticky ! it not matter whether you apply lot or very little , you still wind up this horrible heavy feeling your lips . not only it sticky , but just down right uncomfortable . when i wear lip gloss , i want soft smooth feeling . i want able rub my lips together without them getting stuck together ' dragging ' so speak . also , because this gloss ' consistancy , it tendency clump together your lips form line ' gunk ' both upper lower lip where two meet rest together when you your moth closed . this start happen only 15 minnutes after application . very embarassing when you talking some hot guy then look mirror afterwards discover you gross lines your lips !!!! this product seems popular other viewers , however , i would never reccomend this anyone	-1
clinique exfoliating scrub facial scrub oily skin . it thick , white paste packed medium-size scrubbing grains -more grains than clinique " 7 day scrub " normal skin . use , massage onto clean , wet skin circular motion . rinse warm water . careful not get it your eyes , i once while rinsing it off shower . this scrub adequate job exfoliating retexturizing skin . but it unsuitable sensitive skin , it stinks high heaven . it contains menthol , which burns skin clears sinuses no extra charge . so much menthol so close my nose not good thing . course , it " 100% fragrance free " according clinique , meaning smell menthol unadulterated perfumes . scrub also contains salicylic acid , so beware this might too drying some skin types , especially if used frequently . performance isn't bad . olfactory aesthetics atrocious . this harshest , most caustic facial scrub i've ever used . sensitive complexions beware	-1
i ordered this product because it recommended me skincare website . however , i haven't wanted use this product much due it odor . very medicinal/chemical smelling . makes me wonder what sort harsh chemicals going my face ! i used it pretty consistently first two weeks didn't notice any difference my skin . i wouldn't recommend this product , unless dermatologist specifically tells you use it .	-1
okay so beginning , i so excited this perfume . it smelled amazing scent lasted forever . when i say forever , literally forever . you spray it after your shower afternoon then go sleep ? it lasts until next afternoon . it not even just weak scent that left you . it like if you've spraying it constantly . but here bad part . after using it awhile , i felt sick stomach becuase scent so strong . i felt like scent little too deep . it great people who like strong distinct scents . if not though , this isn't product you	-1
i just received my conditioner today it going back sephora . i don't know how this called conditioner because it nothing more than water . it also smells nothing like vanilla . only scent i could smell coconut i don't want my hair smelling like	-1

this stuff supposed help razor burn , ingrown hairs . honestly after all time using it i can't honestly say if it works . what i say it smells terrible . not weak terrible smell , but strong , overpowering stink . it also burns like crazy when you put it . tend skin company puts out this story miraculous discovery - dentists patient came him after tooth extraction raved whatever anesthetic he given , it cured his ingrown hairs . well , there three ingredients tend skin - alcohol , glycerin , aspirin . thats it . so apparently this dental patient cured ingrown hairs taking aspirin . bottom line , this product insanely overpriced , they hide it this distortion , this silly propaganda its " miraculous discovery . " little bottle alcohol aspirin should cost tenth this	-1
i really not feel tend skin works advertised . irritation my neck persisted if anything only gotten worse after applying instructed . one good thing you if you like me trouble waking up morning --- tend skin helps ! just take strong whiff you'll alert ready your day !	-1
this mascara works great ; it lengthens , separates , defines your lashes it doesn't smudge , but it so hard take off ! i used lancome bi-facil makeup remover , which designed remove waterproof mascara , but it still hard remove . i lost quite few lashes process . i would recommend buying regular definicils , not waterproof	-1
i should listen reviewer who said it smelled like " lemon pledge " ... it really chemical smell not pleasant all . i'm going use it office spray down supply room	-1
i tried lush products found them kinda good but then my friend introduced me melt product line . any benefits i thought i getting lush ... out window . their products seemed , all sudden , unimpressive . i really like melt denver based ! try them out see what you think yourself ( if you aren't here colorado i know they online products too ) make your own choice . i recomend them though i told everyone i know switch ! : -	-1
when i got this candle i very excited , but when i lit it , it seemed make scent strongly smelled fart . when i put it out , fart smell went away	-1
if you're really looking forward brightening your blonde , go salon ask non-ammonia hair lightening or use otc temporary product . chamomile would used every day months really make change your color . expense this product not justified results , while lush likes toot its horn " natural " , designation could apply arsenic . it pretty meaningless when combined artificial preservatives top ten list dangerous additives - parabens	-1
i ordered saturday morning special gift set tried tui herbal shampoo right away . everyone else , no lather lots tangles . after second wash , i decided use my pantene relaxed natural try get some lather moisture my hair . this stuff rip off . plus side , it works fabulously my children hair . they bi-racial naturally curly hair . i don't recommend this anyone relaxed hair . it just doesn't work	-1
all i say not buy this [ ... ] . i just got this stuff used it first last time . it smells horrible . it left wax like film over my hair so bad i could not even get comb through it . i wash my hair ( different product course ) least 6 times get it back normal again ........... what complete rip off !!!	-1
shipping very slow product really isn't worth $23 shipping 11 oz jar . product goes like lubriderm where it feels like you just smearing water your skin . then it starts feel little oily but once you get dressed your skin just feel like you powder all over skin . overall it just ok but it ended up not what i expected or wanted . i looking really good long lasting moisturizer .	-1
i read bobbi brown tinited moisturizer recommendation magazine decided try it . i went saks saleswoman " made up my face " using moisturizer . i thought i liked look store felt coverage stayed all day during my shopping . however , next day when i applied moisturizer alone without all other products i discovered i didn't like it . it went immediately product seemed sink into pores my skin also seemed cakey . i am going return this product concealer i bought well . this product just doesn't apply very smoothly . i think i try laura mercier tinted moisturizer everyone raving instead	-1
i very excited receive this product , yet my enthusiasm quickly turned confusion . call me foolish , but i thought perfume sweet , pleasant aroma{ ?. this pot distinct scent citronella { skeeter } candle ... like one i could smell burning my neighbors yard last summer !!!! i kept applying re-applying it " get smell " it ... not much luck . maybe spray perfume smells far better ??? i not understand how founder says this perfume gets so many compliments ! how ? if i rubbed bug candle wax my wrists , i would not gals clammoring around me asking me what i wearing !!!! i wore this few times just see reactions ..... only 1 person said they could " sota " smell something ! i tried paris hilton , britney fantasy , got tons compliments ! buy your own discretion	-1

small , thin , fragile , not worth five dollars . find better product company	-1
i purchased murad acne complex $40 or so ( measley one month supply ) . i disgustingly excited try it , everything else failed me . proactiv works wonderfully me , but only first month or two , then it seems i grow immunity it . i paid murad acne complex expedited me because i so anxious get ' beautiful , clear skin . ' i read pamphlet , understood my skin could go through " purging " phase , where your skin literally purges all bacteria other acne causing assailants . imagine worst skin you've ever seen . imagine most painful breakouts . my personal " purging " process . it literally worst breakout my entire life . my husband kept telling me continue using products though , because this expected . i'm still using products , though my skin better than it 3 weeks ago , i'm basically back where i when i started . i give up . but i'm not giving up any more money murad	-1
i really wanted like this one but just couldn't get past smell . it really over-powering . lush makes some really lovely smelling soaps but this isn't one them . i didn't find it drying though it lather very nicely . it just too strongly scented my liking	-1

( i am real scent meister too . ) i used it bubble bath , guess what ? bubbles gone within minutes . stick avon bubble bath , it still bubbles tub when you ! then i used it shampoo . guess what ? it didn't lather ! i ended up using trusty suave finish bath . very disapointing product ! i bought 32oz . myself christmas present , can't wait till it gone	-1

this product claim same level tools dermatologists use extract blackheads . but don't count any instructions included tell you how use this little rod . i some searching internet clue , all directions simply said you press loop firmly against blackhead extract comedones . well left red circle my face made tears come out my eyes ... but left blackhead firmly place . if there better way use this tool i highly doubt it produce effective results . there simply nothing unique or different little metal loops than end your fingers . don't waste your money this pathetic product	-1
i love , love , love , lipglass normally . but this shade terrible unless you want look like bad go-go dancer .	-1
disappointingly , this tape not perform well hoped . it unable hold medium or heavier weight fabrics place . using one-inch piece under bra straps not keep them slipping , tape straps eventually started rolling . it definitely unable help prevent strapless bra succumbing newton law gravity ! so not only fashion faux-pas continue occur , tape caused rash/skin irritation each use .	-1
i talked into buying this product minor fine lines . this product i used 4 months , showed no signifigant results well any other product ive used estee lauder . dont waste your money it . i usually look it like this . if any cosmetic retailer offer free gift purchase it usually needs one go it . this product crap !	-1
although this worked well some my blackheads , i felt it very harsh my skin . i worried using it would create even more scars . i would not buy this product again .	-1

i tried phyto index #1 basically , its waste cash . you get same deal grocery store it'll probably better job . let me describe my hair . i am black , my hair thin breaks easily . i not too heavy moisterizers because it weighs my hair down i lose bounce my hair , so i always use serum . i style my hair blow drying using ceramic flat iron get it straight , flowing , bouncy . relaxer almost seem like it didn't take . i haven't relaxer ages . i put this almost month ago i can't wait until it grows out put some real relaxer . also , everytime i would touch up , my hair would stop shedding . phyto index #1 , it sheds more ! breakage strands . i'm ok root strands shedding , that natural . next time , i either order mitzani relaxer online or go professional put . mitzani one my favorites . number #1 silk ii ( i no idea how get ) . homekits , optimum good .	-1
first it smells very sharp citrusy , almost like men cologne . then few seconds later it mellows out bit smells somewhat herbal . after 15 minutes you won't able smell it all . very hyped up mediocre perfume very steep price tag . you'd better off buying bottle herbal essence shower gel getting identical results	-1
i got this bar based other reviews , boy , it strong ! bar last very good long while , unless you actually stomach smell gallons patchouli without getting major headache . patchouli originally supposed base scent other sweeter scents sit upon . it never supposed stand-alone perfume ! like all lush bubble bars , this definitely packs bubbles small amount . i just buyers remorse because i now this oversized bar ( it very big bar ) , i only use bits it when my fiance out town because he gets allergic reaction strong strong strong smell . i think upside it seems like scent isn't nearly so strong once you're actually * * bath . or maybe then your olfactory senses so overwhelmed you just can't tell difference anymore.so yeah , if you love love loooooooove patchouli , then this truly bath bar you . otherwise , i'd steer clear go something gentler . hot milk bubble bar opposite this bar , it really gentle nose . any jasmine flavored products would also better recommendation than this one . i love lush , but not this bar	-1
i write caps because i am so irritated . i tried 5 different carol hair products none including this one worked . not only smells aren't all great they scream . it like people who wear bad perfume that extremely strong , but smells horrible , they think it smells good but it disgust everyon	-1

this absolutely greatest shampoo ever ! i've abusing my hair least 30 years , i never my hair looking feeling healthy it now . there no better product your hair market . all others full damaging detergents chemicals dose silicone thrown make you think your hair clean , but you're killing it . i admire jonathan not treating us like idiots only shampoo doesn't tell you lather , shampoo , rinse twice , but you need . you need use no more than dime-size amount jonathan conditioner . my hair never looked or felt so good	1

after watching blow out seeing how passionate jonathan his product , he sold me . anyone who determined make best product market , obviously whatever it takes make it happen . after seeing how much product , i cringed fact bottle shampoo would much . i later , literally dragged myself sephora purchase this shampoo/conditioner after knowing i willing take risk could eventually end up my closet . i bought it , went straight my bathroom , washed my hair . shampoo not lather , which i expected considering there no harsh detergents or sodium lauryl sulfate . conditioner very light , thin substance . definitely not thick . finale-dried my hair , right there , i knew this product definitely best hair product far , i ever used . my hair , very damaged , brittle full split ends . this product made my hair , very very full , full shine , very soft . my hair beautiful days .... last test .. going work . soon i put my hair down pony tail ( i'm waitress ) , instantly everyone noticed my hair . they asked " what you ?? your hair soo beautiful " .. i told them " 40 dollar shampoo conditioner " well worth cost . definitely salon bottle . now my worst fear it discontinued any reason . if so , i am willing spend 1k stock up save much i . there no other product like it	1

i don't know what complaints this product . it seems people trying use it extreme hold hairstyles . this not purpose this product . i use it my short haircut make ends stay spiky styled out , it works wonderfully . no matter how much you move your head , it stays place , but somehow moves enough keep you stiff look . , when you brush your hair out end day , it feels like you never put it . hair stays soft feels clean . reason why this gel thinner it isn't sticky or goopey your hair other gels . it spreads out easier	1

i've gotten few compliments it ... my advice ladies who want buy perfume via online ... buy smaller bottles first see if you really like scent ... moreso than big bottles . i bought $50 one i like it , but i think it gonna take me awhile finish it ... so now , i'll buy 1.7 oz . first then buy bigger bottles if i like scent . but overall , very fresh sweet smelling ..	1
i always loved happy , but i love my happy heart ! i wear it 99% time . my guy loves smell too ... i often get comments it smells wonderful . not too strong , just enough . :) i'd recommend this perfume everyone , young old .	1

this powder great . it great coverage without looking cakey . i also sensitive skin this never bothered me . only reason i gave it 4 stars because it still little dark very light skin it needs " touched-up " little more often than other powders i've tried , but it worth it	1

if you're like me , you get occasional zit most inopportune time . benefit boo boo zap ! bit spendy such small amount ( size small tube lipstick ) but it help . while it won't erase zit overnight , it get red out . you dab some under or over makeup too because it goes clear , not tinted . definitely worth try	1

this paris hilton perfume wonderful . i got it 2 months ago september one my birthday presents my mum . i'd heard paris hilton perfume while back but i thought it wouldn't good however few days before my birthday my mum brought home tester i really shocked . perfume smells delicous , every time i it i get tons compliments . it really gorgeous scent perfect night day . i lot perfumes my life , some them really expensive but this far best ever . i would recommend this anyone	1
this product not work everyone . it not really people straight , fine hair . it formulated target mostly women color who tightly curled , thick , natural hair . i apply nickle-size this stuff ends my hair before i style it . it leaves my hair soft , manageable , conditioned - eliminating breakage so it grow long healthy . aroma little too earthy my personal taste , but i handle long natural ingredients work . i give it 5 stars	1
this product fantastic ! i use it my daughter who very thick , beautiful coarse hair ! it tames her enough so it not unmanageable leaves it shiny soft - this works well hair balm !!	1
i recently became fan body shop products am only sorry i didn't try them sooner . their products all , without fail , superior quality . satsuma line especially wonderful , my favorite scent body shop . it juicy fresh smell tangerines/oranges . i read some reviews it reminds people creamsicle type scent but i completely disagree . i never liked creamsicle scents i love satsuma . it not cloying or too sweet . it very pure scent i always feel clean beautiful while wearing it . one other thing note this product ... i not always like perfume oils because scent not always accurate when compared other products same line . i am not sure if this because sometimes oils so concentrated they smell like " too much " . satsuma oil not like all - it smells true rest line . scent also lasts long time after applied , due fact it perfume oil . little goes long way - i would not surprised if bottle lasted over year . i love this product give it my highest recommendation .	1
my significate other bought shampoo me , i use hair butter various other products carol daughter . i very fortune actually make it store new york . i very short barber-style hair scent drives people wild . i continue buy these products ; if you like fruity-tuttie smells your hair grease non petroleum based , carol daughter you	1
this stuff wonderful ! i still use moisturizer w/ spf 15 , but why settle spf 15 when you get spf 40 ? this not creamy sunscreen makes your skin feel all oily like it can't breathe , instead it more liquid side you just quickly rub it , then you go ahead put your regular moisturizer makeup over it . it lovely light you wear it every day . it only sunscreen i found enough spf coverage my sensitive pale skin but isn't thick enough clog up my pores cause breakouts . it may seem expensive , but not only quality product worth it , but you only need small amount . i wear it during spring summer , after year i'm still working same bottle . i wasn't sure if it going effective ( not brand you usually associate rugged outdoor activity ) , but after week beach , i only one who face wasn't burned all red , even though everyone else wearing coppertone bullfrog facial sunscreen	1
this scent truly intoxicating . i tried various perfumes like arpege , evelyn rose j'adore but there always something missing . flower kenzo far most satisfying fragrance . it elegance arpege , sensuality evelyn rose classiness j'adore . this product-line also matching deoderant so not clash perfume . how nice ! it not too strong either but lasts long time . i last found my favorite scent makes me feel really good	1

this stuff goes easy , stays well ( but rub off water , won't withstand good cry ) . nice . not quite nice victoria secret liner ( i swear stuff , discontinued 3-4 years ago ) , but way better than anything cheaper . i tried other things . plus , won't irritate my very sensitive eyes	1

i changed this review when i first wrote it couple weeks ago . when i first wrote it , title " i like it " . now i've changed it " i love it !!! " because more i use it , more sure i am i not ever buy regular mascara again . this mascara not smudge ! it not leave " racoon eyes " under your lash line . it goes where you put it stays there until you take it off . it also not irritate my eyes . i never thought i would find mascara didn't make me want rub rub my eyes . i hate rubbing my eyes because i know it makes them baggy makes wrinkles . i seeing mascara which forms tube around lash advertised high-end catalogs lately , intrigued . when i found out philosophy , brand i really respect , this type mascara available , i order it right away . soon ups man brought it , i applied it . it makes your lashes look really long ! they lot individual definition , show up very distinct . this mascara doesn't " fatten " lashes , but it lengthens them so much , it much cleaner look than lash thickening mascara i using . i really like look , mascara not smudge , or rinse off easily water . it seems stay really well , without clumpy , greasy feeling i get waterproof mascara . it comes off neatly little chunks when you rub little " purity made simple " cleanser it . i really like this mascara , i buy it again . actually i am going throw out all my other kinds mascara only get this kind	1

what i really like this product little goes long , long way . i used use various body butters my driest skin , this product like those you don't need use much it . just bit enough , even really dry areas like elbows , knees , feet . i find one fingertipful enough both knees elbows or both feet ; two fingertipfuls enough my legs , post-shaving . i like it better than body butters because it light not greasy ( unless you use too much ) , you use it your whole body , not just drier spots . big plus scent : it fresh , clean herbal scent doesn't linger over-long , so you enjoy it while you're putting it not smell it all day long	1

it over 4 hours since i showered i still catch scent i move . it such sweet , sugary smell reminds me summertime pop music . this may sound like odd description , but it smells way inside jawbreaker tastes , sweet sugary . it also hint cherry or strawberry it . yum yum ! i got two bars cut one up into small cubes wrap cloth put my dresser drawers scent my clothes . i love love love this stuff . reviewer who said this only lasts week must use ton soap ( though who could blame her soap like this ? )or take multiple baths/showers day , because i used it week it doesn't look any smaller than when i first opened it . it really helps unwrap soap soon you get it so it air harden before you use it . this helps it last longer .	1

hi , i just wanted let everyone out their know : this stuff works . i problematic hormonal acne since age 21 . i'm 27 now . after i graduated university started working real job , stress went straight my face ( you all know what i am talking ) . unfortunately me , i am allergic benzyl peroxide i extremely sensitive skin . i also not well tea tree oils most sulfur acidic products ( basically anything kill acne - leaves my face itchy- either swollen like tomato or ineffective i painful acne bumps ... which would you rather ? ) . i little hesitant after reading ingredients noticed cleanser sulfur it there also jar pure salicylic acid blemishes . but , after using other philosophy products my hair body - i decided give it try . hell , what 50 bucks if it clear my acne - if not i always send it back . i started using it 3 weeks ago my skin tremendous transformation . i finally feel like my acne under control . i recommend this product fully it my duty tell everyone this after suffering relentless acne so many years . cleanser awesome needs larger size . blemish serum extremely drying , so if you sensitive like me read directions take it slow - don't reapply throughout day , until your skin ready . day night face creams cool . day one kind like glue seals treatment - entire day ! that why it works , because it your face until night time when you wash ( i even faintly smell product ) . then you use your night hydrogen peroxide cream , yes not benzyl . yeah , this cream intense well . so take it slow until your skin ready . one thing i recommend if you wear make-up , use purity cleanser ( not kit ) initially clean your skin then use acne cleanser . that what i it works me - so i share it you . thing i i take little bit hope not enough spf moisturizer put very little my super dry areas . remember this acne kit intense you may prone drying out peeling - so some oil-free moisturizer help hydrate area around acne . well that it . i hope this helps you let you know your acne tamed doesn't run your life . take care , . rodriguezsurprise , az	1

i don't know people who gave 1 or 2 star reviews but this product only thing saved my hair . i everything getting curly perm stripping color . i used coconut oil , frequent trims , keratin treatments nothing worked . my hair still kept breaking splitting like clockwork . when i used product , 3 treatments later it never healthier . product very oily , so use sparingly when you use it gloss or leave conditioner ! p.s. people healthy , not-so-damaged , normal hair not need use this stuff . because if you , you'll get silly comments tree-hugger nothing product . this product only heavy duty damage ! way , only thing good john frieda frizz-ease ...	1
i thick very coarse hair ( you read title ) i am trying grow out , i tried everything before help tame mane . i always look product not only puts back moisture into my hair , but something fortify it well prevent more damage . i've tried almost every single intensive conditioner stores tried lot salons well , however this one i came across accident . my aunty gone frederic fekkai promo sale bought whole bunch stuff . it didn't really much her hair , so she passed them me try . some stuff i wasn't too impressed , but this hair mask wonders my hair ! after just one use , i could totally tell difference feel texture my hair . usually , i straighten or blow dry my hair when its wet tame it , however this product i didn't too much after . i let my hair air dry just put anti-frizz cream after , good . mask washes out clean ( no greasy residue ) , so this product really good weekly restoration . but what it seems like , this hair mask ( all products , i suppose ) work some people not others . your best bet get your hands sample size before you shell out money full tube , since it kind expensive	1

philosophy products really changed my skin , i know this true because times i run out philosophy products replaced them even very expensive department store brands , my skin starts breaking out looking blotchy , uneven tired . then i remember how much philosophy me , i absolutely reorder . if you buff your face microdelivery peel , wash thoroughly " purity cleanser " , then follow this product , " when hope not enough serum " then " hope jar " moisturizer your entire face neck , your skin just glow , you amazed how fast blemishes blotches just go away don't come back ! after using microdelivery peel , my skin looks 75% better right away . after week using all products , my skin clear glowing . i really believe these products . they feel great , smell great work great	1

even swimming two hours pool , i still mascara when i emerge water . would not without this !	1
this not strong floral fragrance not sweet , but it smells wonderful . it just gets better better your skin . very complex , very different	1
long time i avoided anything gardenia like plague-it always smelled too sickly sweet me . this perfume changed my mind completely-yes , there gsrdenia but its very light fresh unlike any gardenia you've ever smelled . try it yourself	1
i say i quite impressed this fragrance . i tend look other way when product receives little too much hype or attention . i can't say this cologne worth great deal hype , but i say it pleasant disctinctive odor . cologne not something you would wear daily basis , but would go very well suit special occasion . bad side , cologne elegant odor comes slightly feminine aroma . while i am not one prefer " musky " cologne i could without smelling like woman . additional downside would it high cost per ounce ... overall , since receiving cologne gift , i am quite pleased adding this fragrance my collection . good job diddy daddy puff ...	1
when i first got package delivered me work , my assistant i smelling all products ... this one made both us scrunch our noses distaste . but when i got home actually applied it my hair , it smelled nothing like nasty old lady smell i detected before . reason why i given this product 5 stars , because i feel this conditioner unfairly graded here . conditioner people curly or processed hair -- meaning , if you straight , thick hair , this conditioner may seem like waste money due amount product you apply . also , us girls curly hair know , not all curly hair equal . some thick , springy curls gets curlier shorter cut it , while others thinner quality their hair which actually gets curlier longer it gets . i'm later , i think this why this product works me . i understand how this may seem misleading those thicker curl types , but i'm here set record straight one . i hope it helps deciding if this product right you	1
i really enjoyed this bomb - it very refreshing relaxing . it big bomb i could broken it half but i didn't want risk missing thing ! so far i happy my lush purchases my favorite bomb sex bomb , but i would buy this one again or give it gift	1

this product blended well into my skin , i forget i wearing makeup . what amazing avon their products very economical yet very high quality . i am usually acne-prone so i am careful what i use my face . it not oily yet even dry skins use it . it very matte worn alone	1
this powder provides excellent coverage without thick . ( thick powder base horrible - it always looks like you dunked your face bowl flour . ) my freckles still there , but my skintone more even . it its job concealer very well - no red spots , no dark circles - it works very well foundation/powder . much better than any other powder foundation i've ever used . come think it , much better than any liquid foundation i've ever used	1
i love this stuff ! i " my mother hands " my sister calls them . years go they're getting more more wrinkly i also age spots . i gave some my sister last year now she got me buying it too ! this hand cream makes my hands smooth silky feeling without greasy . it also improved condition my cuticles only few applications . i'd highly recommend it anyone who dry hands cuticles . you'll love it too	1
best thing this product there numbing agent . apply leave skin 20-30 seconds then your skin begins numb slightly , then you start shaving . it great because you don't feel razor skin much ; which makes shaving quite pleasant . i've searched other shaving cream market this numbing feature closest anthony logistics which i don't think nice philosophy common man . little goes long way when you shave so tube lasts quite long . i would buy this again ...	1
i've never liked my lashes until i put this . what difference	1
when you buy this perfume your girlfriend , don't tell her it under 40 dollars ! i don't know why people make big deal over expensive perfume . yeah , like it really smells better just because it more expensive . anyway , sarah jessica parker perfume really nice scent you'll want smell over over . it nice you don't spend lot money it either . add just touch proper use	1

if you're like me your scalp itches like crazy after you get your color , nioxin system scalp therapy answer . ( numbers only represent type hair you , use lower number if your hair more fine . ) use this once or two times after color , scalp itch goes away . product claims help thinning hair . i no issue , i think i found " off-market " use product , but it works me so i'll take it	1
i wasn't crazy this mascara when i first put it but it grew me . brush not regular mascara brush it took little getting used however i love it now . it brushes clumps right off your lashes you apply . they'll long nicely separated . stuff stays your lashes like glue all day . no smearing it still looks perfect end day point where i feel like it shame wash my eye makeup off . i'm really pleased it . i want try lancome new mascara too but this one definitely keeper .	1

i given this product gift , i just love it . i'll often wear it weekends without any additional makeup . it smoothes this skin surface . true - coverage not same tinted foundation - but it offers lot improvement worn alone . also , i using tinted cream makeup base not working well my dry skin . it would create lines , etc . so i started combining two things - tinted cream base philosophy skin perfector together sponge before applying bingo - this solved problem . so if you want tint plus smoothness , you might want give this try .	1
i first tried amazing grace couple years ago . time i dresser full department store colognes . scent amazing grace somehow undescribable . suffice it say , it " perfect " fragrance , those other scents history . it pleasing person who wears it , pleasing someone just walking you . some perfumes walk into room before person , or so strong it makes other people eyes water . we've all around someone like . not so amazing grace . it just harmony you those around you	1

if you dry skin your feet these socks fantastic . i place mine microwave 15 seconds while i apply moisturizer my feet . slide socks onto your feet soon microwave finished . 15 minutes you quick , but effective moisturizing treatment . if your feet really dry you could same thing but leave them overnight . i found overnight option little warm my feet . but , it might work fine you . these socks 94% cotton 6% spandex . they machine washed tumbled dried . i not found it necessary launder them each time i use them . i use light moisturizer ( kerasal ) , so you might different experience if you use heavier product moisturize . i would highly recommend this product .	1
this stuff amazing . i use " candle light " underneath my eyes around my brows . it makes my eyes look picture perfect all day long . it especially beautiful sunlight - really makes my blue eyes pop !	1
i searching what seems like forever nice cologne or perfume not all flowery overpowering . now i finally found it ! i love this scent ! it just smells so clean fresh . i'm so glad i tried it ! first couple times i wore it , i received compliments questions what i wearing . never happened me before . so i went purchased lotion shower cream too . only bad thing it , like many others said , smell doesn't last too long so i keep reapplying it . maybe now i lotion too , smell last longer . i would highly recommend trying this fragrance . i think you love it	1

i recently realized while my wife spends hundreds high quality skin care products us , i still using throw away razors . i recently received fusion razor loved , until i went replace blades . $4+ piece , they last no longer than any other blade . so , i got online researched shaving what i learned , though there advances shaving technology , nothing improved , only made more expensive . i learned my dad right ; all it takes great shave good safety razor , decent brush , shaving soap mug . i received my razor couple days ago now , i wake up eager take shower shave . nothing ever cut this close without giving me razor burn . my skin sensitive i no problems since getting this amazing razor . it worth price , too , because it same cost 4 sets fusion replacements . replacement blades this razor fifty cents piece far better job . i read reviews this razor people who , apparently , weren't trained shave . this razor not cut against grain . also , handle weighted , so you allow razor all work , or you run real risk filleting your face . patient . great shave takes little more commitment than just breaking out foam disposable razor . let razor work . i assure you , even if it takes few days get technique down , you thrilled this razor . nicest feature this amazing razor it allows you adjust closeness blade . i learned most people like it one one half . mine set one half it gives me perfect shave every time . until now , i didn't know such thing even possible . happy shaving	1
like i stated title , this isn't my favorite three-in-one product philosophy . i several their scents , i really love cinnamon buns some chocolatey ones . strawberry milkshake smells nice , but it very sweet . i wouldn't say it smells artifical , but it doesn't smell like fresh strawberries , either . i used it shampoo/conditioner quite often , i no issues it . i fine hair , it didn't leave me tangles , like some other reviewers complained .	1
i find these soaps very good . there actually 4 different kinds i believe one also sensitive skin . if someone felt none clean feeling afterwards , perhaps they not taking their makeup off proper product , or they using wrong soap their skin type . this soap similiar dhc soaps japan . if they drying try using correct soap . help i would suggest going clinque counter or ask me .	1
this shaving brush perhaps most inexpensive way get pure badger bristle shaving brush . i've now using it year half , it not shed any real amount its bristles like cheaper brushes market . brush head remains densely packed quite soft . hopefully , it remain way some time come . meantime , i enjoy close comfortable shaves aided this brush . because it , i sworn off canned shave gels every situation except travel . they just can't compare your average $1.50 cake shaving soap this brush . this very worthwhile purchase me	1

go read review i wrote shampoo same goes this product . cheaper qvc then amazon like all other 30 or so products i shopped around last 6 months . go back into stores people you find prices cheaper than amazon !!!	1
this great cleaner , but i'd suggest getting anthony algae cleanser first . this glycolic facial cleaner prep your face good shave , but overdries . it not suggested those who dry skin or acne problems	1
i am impressed this new scent philosophy . it seems just like lemon pudding my mom likes so well . definitely new fave	1
i love this perfume because it really lifts my mood . i always thought it little more citrus-y , but it just very fun perfume . it also nice because it fun flirty but still mature young professional type way -- if makes any sense . ultimately , it great perfume , i wear it almost daily	1
i absolutely love this fragrance . i like use lot philosophy products . only problem i it doesn't last long . when i put it i get lot compliments when it fresh	1
love this hot summer days , dry winter days hot flashes :) must catching vapors also good when out sun ..	1
i love everything these sops !!! they luxurious delicious same time ...... one thing i need indulge . scents last days after you've used them ..... my bathroom still smells like mix verbena honey-almond !!!! just scrumptious !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not mention how your skin smells feels afterwards ! these amazing soaps everyone should use . i feel exquisite using them gift sets fabulous thing give friends or even aquaintences . they sure think how thoughtful you give it them everytime they use this wonderful soap !!!!!!	1
this my everyday scent last six years . predominent note sparkling anise , anise affects cold , even metallic , chemic artifice . swirling this shivery base note hints moss , violet , vanilla-like tonka , lending aura both forest fantasy . though this relatively popular scent , lolita eschews convention . there no white flowers , no rose , no peach , none banal cloying sweetness plagues so many scents . this perfume instead sensual yet apart , not all come-hither but insinuating dark grimm tale . tonka sweet powdery , gently seductive , while more prominent anise intoxicates . bottle stunning ; i never throw out spent one .	1
i love include one these gifts ...... people love them ..... makes bath really special ..... little rosebuds floating water ..... just charming	1
if you love roses , this romantic bath luxury , seven rose buds your bathing delight . candlelit bath romance , let it dissolve unencumbered . scent but no mess , put it mesh bag first , because little flower bits all over tub . least it no glitter . scent not particularly strong , but it full natural rose scent smells wonderful	1
i love this soap ! it smells so fresh my skin feels great after i wash it ! i am definetely ordering more this soap	1
i started using this cream during my 2nd month pregnancy . i think it important start building elasticity your skin early , which could reason i success it . while cream kindof expensive -- when you think avoiding stretchmarks , no price too high . i used 4 tubes duration . i expected get stretchmarks because my mom them me , so i happy get anything less than hers . anyway , i didn't get any all my stomach until last two weeks ( my baby 8lbs . 8oz . ) they really small . i put cream my breasts abdomen every day after shower , but because it expensive i skipped my sides ( love handle area ) get stretchmarks there which darker than ones my stomach . since my stomach gone down , ones my stomach very light probably go away enough satisfy my ego . i highly recommend giving mustela cream chance	1
i'm 18 ! well you think what 18 this cream . i don't any wrinkle . my skin really good until i get into college . my eyes become really tired i start lot dark circle plus puffiness . after reading recommendation fashion magazine , which says everybody every age need eye cream . ok , fine , i get one . i chose one got highest rate ! overall quality , it very good moisturize my eye area . this means it easier apply foundation/concealer/eye makeup . but my puff still here . i still dark circle ! no reducing ! i know i need better schedule enough sleep but still , i expected higher this product . size , small little teeny tiny one good enough you use months . usually i use it night . when i apply concealer , i apply time .	1
i looking high low fragrance wasn't strong . i tried so many perfumes body sprays it ridiculous . i finally found one i use more than week . i love it ! smell so clean simple . first day i wore it i 3 seperate people tell me i smelled good . i never even one person tell me , let alone 3 . i amazed . also , i noticed they told me i smelled good . they didn't say your perfume smells good . i am not sure how describe smell . it reminds me out-of-the-shower fresh smell we wish we could all day . i never use any other fragrances but philosophy fragrances . i plan trying all their other wonderful scents well	1

i like gloss isn't goopy or sticky , it provides sheer wash color seems stay put while , but you don't get much product . i bought flare love color way it somewhat stains your lips light wash color , so even when gloss wears off you still some color your lips . i wasn't really thrilled small amount gloss you actually get pen . but overall , i like it , but don't know if i'd buy it again	1

guy who never paid attention face cream he used , i found h2o plus amazing stuff . non-greasy , no heavy scents -- it worth every penny	1
so i little suspicious this product first ; eye creams seem most benign things market . when beauty consultant put this my face i let her just obliging not really expecting anything . we continued talk her products i realized i feeling burning under my eyes ( not painful just noticeable ) she said : " see look it working already ! " i looked saw nothing but it felt good she kinda high pressure so i bought it . when i got car looked myself i could see definite improvement . skin under my eyes tighter , it still dark under my eye but without all baggage it much improved . so i think if i use this product put my concealer over it i am going notice huge difference . highly recommended	1
i work retail so i'm my feet hours time . throughout day , my feet sweat ( yes , gross i know ... but there no smell ) , so gave lush toes try . i noticed huge difference first time i tried it . my whole shift , i wasn't able feel any moisture my feet all !! my feet toes felt fresh it when i first started work . dusting powder made real tea tree oil , so it works antibacterial agent well . it supposed handle stinky feet well , my boyfriend swears it . he works construction uses it everyday loves it because it not girly smelling even packaging not girly , so he doesn't mind leaving it work . toes wonderful product you only need use real little bit	1
advent those truly ridiculous multiblade " shaving systems " ( oh , no -- not " razors " ; they're " shaving systems . " feh . ) , merkur blades welcome standby . they full case ( 20 10-blade packs ) $80 or $90 . week per blade , even " two-pass " shaving ( once grain beard once against it ) , that enough few years . i've using merkur blades almost 25 years , overall quality value , i'd say they're best around . i've found them best when teamed merkur " progress " adjustable razor . using both correctly furnishes best shave next straight razor , without all trouble ( well , " enjoyment " straight razor aficiandoes ) inherent practice .	1
i wasn't so sure claims this shampoo bar would make my hair super shiny , but i didn't really care either way because it smells very nice i just like relaxing while i try wake up ( or wind down ) shower . anyway , it make difference ! my hair noticeable shinier while using this stuff , though i would try lush " big " shampoo if you want see even bigger difference . perfect format brining you gym or travelling - nothing spill ! make sure you get one little travel tins bring you so it doesn't soap everything your gym/travel bag :) my only complaint it only lasted week me . i medium-long hair , didn't use much . i haven't tried my other shampoo bar yet , so i don't know if that more problem just this particular bar , or if it problem across board . read reviews find out !	1

those dry , tight thirsty skin or perhaps any phases changes texture comfort level their usually good skin this balm gods i call it . cream comes slick white tube gold orange stripe top squeezed out like toothpaste thick metal tube lets me get very last bit end , total bonus since i hate wasting product . expensive , but well worth it since dr. hauschka products extremely natural healing their properties no harsh chemicals disguised pink dyes fragrances . this cream smells like pale pink bulgarian rose garden , something i got experience child it makes me smile twenty years later i used this cream . winter high times stress or freaky dry skin episodes usual scenarios would require me use this cream i usually stick my favorite green tube cetaphil lotion my day night moisturizer ever since i got it my dermatologist who wonders my complexion two years ago . great face cream also wonderful eye cream , especially when computer i use work always seems suck any moisture form my eye area right out . this patted right top makeup refreshes plumps up skin , only tiny bit needed . this cream lasts months so this price it really bargain considering what i put my face always shows up results or neglect if wrong product use . - kasia .	1

when i little girl , i would watch my mother take her makeup off her dressing table . cold cream soft cloth tissues . gentle misting water then dabbing cloth . then night cream , eye cream ( " dab gently , never rub " ) , special lotion her throat collarbone area . she would impart her beauty secrets me while i sat transfixed . although i convinced she most beautiful woman world , i surprised all these lotions oils , she didn't ' slide right out bed night . " exercise , sweetheart . drink lots water . never go sleep your makeup -- no matter how tired you . never wash your face regular soap . moisturize , moisturize , moisturize . your skin last you lifetime nothing gives away woman age like uncared skin . " while i am not sure where i would even find ' cold cream ' today , i follow vast majority her regimen . two items i use under my eyes avon repair eye serum hydrofirming bio6 eye cream . cream plumps up firms delicate tissue around eye , serum smoothes moisturizes skin . i consider avon products unsung work horses beauty industry . they almost always exactly what they say they going very modest price . expensive boutique department store products rarely better job usually exorbitantly overpriced . when you factor avon products go sale regularly ( which when i usually stock up ) , you getting even better deal your money . while i am not complete cheapskate , i love bargain i want feel like i am getting full value my money . skin around eyes quite thin delicate , so i think if you follow my mother advice " dab gently , never rub " avon repair eye serum hydrofirming bio6 eye cream you able keep this area smooth , without greasy , even most drying climatic conditions	1

shaved everything cheapo disposables thiers-issard straight razors , i say merkur progress probably best all-around razor available today . it excellent heft balance , adjustment feature simple straightforward . ( although i agree numbered adjustment seems perform little differently depending blade used . ) it easy keep clean -- assuming you don't mind unscrewing it taking blade out wipe off head frame . also used venerable old gillette " fat boy " 1950s , i'd still rate progress better razor ; screw operated adjustment makes it constantly adjustable , not just steps . since this safety razor , its performance significantly dependent blades used . i've tried both merkur blades japanese " feather " blades , would say it toss-up . since it adjustable safety razor , it perfectly suited two-pass close shaving . higher setting excellent first pass grain beard , lower setting pass against grain . adjustment also allows you adjust razor conditions your skin beard . if you've let yourself get day worth stubble ( c'mon--don't we all ? ) you set blade high mow hedge . if you need quick clean-up before night town , you set it lower " once lightly , james . " so if you want really well-made , no-nonsense but very versatile razor last good long time , this good bet . only problem might preventing pals swiping it , or reminding your wife/significant other take it apart clean it after she smooths up those pretty pins you love so well . one recommendation : shop around . you get these under $40.00 if you bargain-hunt , likewise full 20-count boxes carded merkur 10-blade refill sets	1

i bought laura mercier kit : mini glaces six glaces including : champagne glace , rose glace , bare beige glace , ambre rose glace , petal glace violet glace . my favorite rose , but all colors very beautiful . i also full size melon , my favorites . while colors beautiful , provide lots shine long wearing , they very sticky . mac lip glass much stickier , so if you don't mind , they might right you . also , good thing kit you get try lots different colors , but tubes quite small , steep price . so , if you willing put up sticky gloss high price tag exchange some most beautiful colors , this might right gloss you .	1
almost every time i wear " curve " i get comments ladies , very good thing . i currently 10 different types cologne i wear this one lot . it seems good scent lasts throughout day without drench yourself it	1
this product worth price ! i use it every day especially my whole eye area i love it ! it not leave my skin feeling or looking greasy either .	1
this my favorite soap world . new bar scent my bathroom weeks , scent lingers my skin well . soap gentle long-lasting . i recommend it highly	1
i some dry bumpy bits top my arms resistant any scrubby product i've ever tried use , but buffy got my skin so smooth ! amazing , highly recommended . soak tub/shower/whatever so hot water softens up your skin , then scrub away . small bar lasts 2 or 3 uses ; large twice big . small one more reasonably priced people who just want sample stuff . this thing lots great little scrubby bits it . ground rice , ground almonds , adzuku beans . not just one , but three , they all super-scrubby . you'll little red when you're , but it so worth it once you've cooled off your skin smooth baby bottom . only downside it makes your tub look like somebody dumped sand into bottom it once thing drains . bar melts around ' hot water ' temperature , you're not supposed use any moisturizer after using this stuff - but you really don't ! moisturizing oils bar really work very well . i'll definitely picking up couple more these . cocoa butter/lemon/lavendar scent really amazing well . soothing refreshing , it wake you up morning or calm you down night before you go sleep . definitely try this thing , though , if you're looking ultimate exfoliation plus moisturizing	1
smell great feel skin great ! just like other reviews suggest !	1
first all let me preface this stating i literally just put this product minutes ago . i chemical peel over week ago given retin therefore my face peeling so horribly , i thought i couldn't leave house . i mean my makeup would literally come right off . i horrified ! i tried several moisterizers sometimes multiple ones but could still see skin flaking off onto my desk , so i researched this went sephora bought kit . i washed my face , serum added this product i honestly not see 1 single flake dry skin , it tingle but i think it because my face raw so dry but it feels if my skin drinking it up like cold glass water . i am anxious see what happens weeks come . i mild cyctic acne struggled it years . i decided see dermatolist then got chemical peels it helped rid me bad acne but then i so dry 2 wks i couldn't bare even look myself . my skin doesn't hurt anymore , allthe sensitive people , there sensitve version but if you dry skin crazy acne treatments they make us or peels or just dry winter heat , this product you . if it seems strong then use it every other night until you skin adapt . or just once day . i hope you find this product helpful like i becaus i am still looking mirrow that my desk	1
i used use mac glass lipgloss before juicy tubes around . any time wind blew i hair stuck incredibly sticky gloss which , you know , extremely unpleasant annoying . juicy tubes stays , but doesn't overly-sticky feeling which wonderful . i don't wear much makeup find juicy tubes add " something special " dewy face . i recommend daiquiri or berry bold most natural looks . daiquiri more straightforward shine while berry bold gives you red lipped childlike look we all used naturally . you adore this gloss . i can't live without it	1
my boyfriend this cologne i love it ! it smells so good . even if he wearing deodorant not cologne , it smells if he . it may little expensive side ( not expensive amazon.com macy or other department stores ) , but it well worth it . just sure correctly select item you want because picture shown cologne	1
after hearing so many good things philosophy cinnamon buns , i just try it out myself . i found it not really smell like cinnamon buns , but more like water mixed sugar . if you use it your head , it leave lingering smell , but it won't last long your body after taking shower . i think this product nice way treating yourself , but i definitely not think it smells like cinnamon buns , which left me slightly disappointed . overall , great product	1

bottle itself real looker , thick rich smooth glass encasing golden rich amber jewel like liquid inside . fancy shmancy i said i took it out delivery box . i opened bottle take whiff my oh my , it definitely worth price tag . real test course came bath time , this sure delivered beyond looks alone . bath water turned bubbly luscious earthy aromas warm , primrose vanilla rich , juicy creamy finish apricot . this should eaten , not bathed ! insanely delicious it would make wonderful present any friend or relative , but better yet yourself . apparently this used body wash , i am really looking forward using it shower , i'm shower person morning , this would make tantalizing shower experience sure . i reviewed few these bath items today , now i feel so sweet sleepy after my bath i feel extremely happy getting this bubble bath . it little delectable products such this one bring you calm pleasantness after long day , nothing replace some nice relaxation alone tub . even my boyfriend loved scent he used it other day , so it both men women , but i might hide it case he secretly likes it too much !	1

i'm really anal scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored vanilla , but mac lipglass isn't vanilla-ish all ! it got very pigmented color , it stays long time gloss , each tube lasts long time ... don't let what other reviewer said vanilla scent throw you off	1

tried true might well describe products offered caswell-massey generations relied upon them both quality efficacy . established 1752 , it america oldest chemist perfumer . my grandmother enjoyed their products , i , too . their almond aloe liquid soap boon because it not only cleanses well but moisturizes it so . far too many soaps leave skin feeling dry itchy . almond , we know , lovely distinctive fragrance well skin softening properties . combine it aloe which contains healing properties , you uniquely beneficial cleanser . other ingredients include vitamins nourishment . this soap particularly useful those who wash their hands frequently during day those normal dry or sensitive skin . other items caswell-massey almond aloe line include body balm , bath seltzer , cold cream soap , hand cream , hand body emulsion , almond body splash	1
i love , love this product . i can't believe how much i actually used it ; i ran out my box within two months ! all those tops wide open neck needed bra strap sit edge my shoulder -- this kept my straps place all day night ! few my work tops buttons stop short towards bottom ; i use strips close flap place so it smooth all way down . tip : some cases i cut strips half ; even half strip holds my bra straps place . this product holds things place or down , it not lift hold -- its not ducked tape .	1

i this product working my hair right now . it simply wonderful ! first off , it smells like lovely victorian rosebud-almond pudding . it similar consistency . i get three four uses each container i very thick hair . my hair preciously quite dry abused . i dyed it twice last six months . after one use this product my hair felt better than it years . silky , strong shiny . i love this product ! i highly recommend it .	1
this treatment works extremely well ! i looked here saw there no extrememly helpful reviews , so i decided write one . i long , golden , untreated hair . however it dry straw so i decided try this . here how it : smell amazing ( it smells like pumpkin pie or gingerbread cookies ) after use hair looks soft shiny , however it makes hair flat . this product deep moisturizer therefore hair not any " pouf " it . it still worth money though ! rehydration hair supremely important this rehydrates well . just after shampooing not use conditioner ( unless just doesn't work well you ) , which helps flatness . few helpful tips : 1 . this goes dry hair2 . after putting lots this treatment , try putting bag over your hair keeping it shut clip . heat your head produces allows hair cuticles open fully absorb treatment . this works 2xs better than lush intstructions ( my mother hairstylist ) . 3 . leave bag tight around your head 20 40 minutes4 . afterwards shampoo like normal , but i still recommend not using conditioner day . hopefully this helps anyone questions . this really amazing product should used twice month ( more if you'd like but that probably not necessary ) . enjoy your beatiful shiny hair !	1
first spray , this pretty potent cologne , but after 1-2 minutes this fades into nice rosey spice scent much lighter than it green original polo brother . lasts all day long into night . worth checking out if you fan cool water lotto , or lighter scented cologne .	1
i love these inserts ! i trouble finding ones this size . not too big , not too small . they definitely help me fill out my bras ! i would suggest putting them bras pockets inserts . i tried just setting these my bra , but if i moved my arms up my bra moved around , i afraid cupcakes would fall out . these great product though	1
but it definitally not work it intended . it intended moisturize hair . i long , fine , oily hair , i received trichomania gift . i love smell , but when i first used it , it left my hair very dry which i consider good thing considering state my hair . it just didnt what it supposed . however , if you really oily hair , this thing you . no problems lathering either , especally if you rub bar your hair , not your hands . doesnt leave white flakes either	1
i first smelled this perfume colleague mine , year ago . every time she walked me i got whiff this heavenly scent she wore nearly every day . so , i finally stopped her asked what she wearing . i'd never heard it , so i jumped online looked it up , found bottle bought it . i couldn't wait try it out , so when perfume finally arrived i put it right . imagine my disappointment when i smelled scent totally unlike one i'd experienced . me it overpoweringly musky , nothing like seductive fragrance i'd smelled my colleague . but , odd thing happened . i didn't wash it right off , when i smelled it again 30 minutes later it become alluringly sensual perfume i'd fallen love . fact , longer i wore it better it smelled . obviously it depends your body chemistry achieve it bloom . now , i wear it when i go out evenings , people comment how wonderfully sexy it smells . if you buy this perfume don't judge it too quickly , i .... give it little time you're sure love it . you only need use little , it lasts hours .	1

i searched far wide product aids treatment/management keratosis pilaris ( little red bumps backs my arms ) . it estimated 40-50% population form keratosis pilaris there no cure skin condition . however , this neostrata aha 8 significantly reduced bumps redness after only 2 weeks . after 4 weeks , it almost vanished . only drawback after 2-3 weeks non-use bumps tend resurface . but , if you keep application up , bumps stay away ! i use it religiously over summer or if i any upcoming special occasions where i want look my best . i found product self magazine , suggesting its use keratosis pilaris management nothing but rave reviews !! finally , something works	1
i've using murad 3 weeks now , it made huge difference ! i am my early 20 problems mild breakouts since my teens . i've tried drugstore products , wich never seemed make any difference , proactive which so harsh it actually burned made my skin much worse . murad gentle enough me use twice day , left my skin breakout free ! it also improved texture feel my skin , makes my pores nearly invisible . i recomend murad anyone whose skin breakout prone but too sensitive benzoyle peroxide formulas other acne products . only complaint i murad price - it little much poor college student - but results worth it if you afford it !	1

high beam nice subtle highlighter . however , sure blend it very quickly well or it look unnatural certain lighting ( it'll look like you pink nail polish your face ) . it also tendency emphasize pores . so only use it areas your face where you don't any , like top cheek bone under your eyebrows .	1

what wrong everyone reviewing these products ? this your hair scalp , not face . again , after experimenting few times , if it doesn't work , just say so state facts , not hype your feelings jonathan his show television	1
after reading other reviews i little worried using product i already ordered . after using it few days now my hair never looked better , i truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner meant me . i fine , super straight hair , middle short . it feels clean sleek . conditioner smells like pina coloda , yum ! i would definatly recommend this my hair type . would maybe recommend lather shampoo your hands first then work thoroughly ( it doesn't lather well some shampoos lots glycerine them ) only apply conditioner towards end your hair leave few min . hope helps	1
i purchased these gloves not moisturizing my hands , but protect them when i'm driving or riding my bike sun . my main concern they would heavy or clumsy , but they fit like second skin , lightweight , grip well , extremely comfortable . i wear them hours time without noticing i them , so i imagine they would easy sleep . they wash like dream . definitely buy more	1
exuding citrusy aromas , still life bath bomb smells glorious . bath bombs made sodium bicarbonate , so they're like " alka seltzers " bath . some lush bath bombs contain petals other plant parts still life no exception . mine filled sunflower petals -- even complete flower leaf ! although bathing such bath bombs luxurious , clean up quite messy . ( when my husband came into bathroom while i bathing , he exclaimed " what heck ?! " why , it sunflower petals , my dear ... ) i first rate mess my hands after bath . i keep clearing drain water go down . then i it few more times before i could finally rinse tub ! if you don't mind lush bath bombs include petals other flora fauna -- you love bright , citrusy scents--you'll likely love still life bath bomb . it smells heavenly , tints water golden hue . however , if you don't like plant parts floating your bath -- nor clean up involved afterwards -- steer clear still life	1

i using soaps creams few months now . i started use soaps creams mainly because they provide better value money they help my sensitive skin . i always sensitive skin shaving never helped . i recently came across truefitt hill trafalgar figured if it good enough royalty , then i should give it try . i definitely see why this official royal shaving cream . it wasn't until i tried this cream combined it merkur futur double-edged razor badger brush i knew what it close shave no razor burn . like previous reviewer said , most people need realize very little goes long way . just small dab wet badger brush you able create warm thick lather make you love shaving . shaving old fashioned way take bit longer , but it feel luxurious results much better than anything you get mach 3 gel . i finally go whole day without shaving . if i go two days , i nice 5 o'clock shadow around 8 . this best bet shave cream . it smells very good provides more than enough lubrication razor simply glide over . badger brush must though . truefitt hill trafalgar simply fantastic .	1

like others , i skeptical shampoo bar . i really , really like this bar . it great scent . first time i used it , smell stayed my hair most day , now it lasts few hours . its pretty deep cleanse , so i really only use it when i've bars or when my hair full product . i use it twice week or so . it really great lather . my boyfriend even uses it , since smell isn't floral , but rather spicy nature . little cinnamon sticks fall out after while , but bar itself held . i definitely buy again . if you dry hair , you should probably use this sparingly , your hair ' squeaky ' clean , or just make sure follow-up good conditioner	1
i used many lush products some i love , some i hate ! this one definitely falls love category . i thick , medium texture , color-treated , slightly wavy hair . this stuff works !! i use it every other wash remove all residue salon shampoos , conditioners , products . it makes my hair so shiny . it lasts forever , 3 months using it every other day . sure store it where it not get wet - i use disposable gladware . , i haven't even gotten best part . smell refreshing - mostly cinnamon it makes your scalp tingle just bit . can't say enough this one !	1
if you using this line makeup -- i strongly recommend it -- you must get brushes -- its worth money-makes application breeze	1

i love love love love blackberry bath bomb !!!!! it turned my bath water very pretty purple color smell wonderful ! i can't really describe it . it didn't smell fruity me all but very relaxing soothing . once i got out tub smell stayed my skin several hours . when i putting my daughter bed she snuggled her head my arm just kept smelling . we both laid there smelling my arms :)	1
this bath bomb not really smell like blackberry ; nonetheless , it sweet , fruity smell i cannot quite place my finger . it smells bit like grape kool-aid , but not sweet or syrupy . smell not strong some lush other bath bombs , but it quite pleasan t.t he bomb turns bath water wonderfully relaxing purple color . most bath bombs lush , it leave ring around tub . order remedy this , i usually wipe tub down my washcloth after i am my bath . granted , this not way one wants cap off relaxing bath , but it save agony scrub tub following morning . bomb turns water quite soft leave your skin feeling delightfully supple . i quite pleased this aspect bomb . scent it leaves your skin subtle lasted couple days . this definitely one lush more simple bath bombs , but it definitely not boring . small surprise accompanies bomb somewhat compensates lack glitter more powerful floral/fruit scent . not one more memorable bombs , but really quite pleasing . if you want take break some lush more overpowering products , this bomb you .	1

rock star creamy pink soap produces abundance lather . i've found it less drying than many other soaps , less drying than certain lush other soaps ( glycerin ones , like bohemian sea vegetable . ) while creaminess certainly asset , it also means soap melts away quickly , reviewer mentioned . this somewhat expensive soap , more than $7 3 oz ., this definitely something consider before purchasing . bar this soap lasts me week , showering every day . admittedly i'm fairly enthusiastic user , it likely possible use bit less , but i'm not sure would make huge difference . this brings us scent . if you like sweet , candy-like scents , rock star amazing . it very sweet , very pink , very girly . overall , this lovely candy scent ( same lush creamy candy bubble bar ) . it bit hard scent explain , but very much sweet candy-like . overall , this lovely , luxurious soap . it also expensive soap . these main benefits/drawbacks . i gave it 5 stars because i love scent texture	1
this perfume smells so good . it not too overbearing but it not wear off easily either . it sort sweet light . i got sample macy i finished it asap now i need bottle ! i love it	1
i loved this bath bomb but it doesn't lot " pow " so if that what you looking , go elsewhere this one . middle hidden surprise which i like - tea bag . i didn't think scent all strong water wasn't exceptionally softer but it ok experience . i don't know i'd get it again though	1

i acne since age 12 , though it never severe , i hate it . i've tried lots over counter products various prices , this first stuff i've used works . however , ( this huge however ) like most companies philosophy assumes acne prone skin always oily skin . this not so . my skin very dry sensitive , even areas where i am most likely break out . i notice when i bought kit it likely strip oil my skin , but i assumed moisturizing would help . not so . acne cleared up nicely , but now i sizable ( me anyway ) flaking patch next one my eyebrows . i using aveno moisturizer after h202 cream , blemish syrum only once day ( sparingly ) but i am now going try philosophy hope jar sensitive skin put it after everything . hopefully ( no pun intended ) this help	1

if you're looking best scissortweezers , look no further . construction impeccable feel very solid . i went thru other brands makes came across sephora own model - very bad . they sell tweezerman products , but they not sell this particular model due fact they sell their own flimsy alternative . not substitute this other products . price unbelievably expensive , but once you get hold it you understand . you only buy it once this last more than lifetime	1
this product described anti-ager , but i've noticed year or so i've used it works wonders any number skin imperfections . it moisturizing but not all greasy . it dramatically reduced my breakouts noticeably evened out skin tone my chin . it contains ingredient " help minimize facial hair growth " since using it i've able reduce my number lip waxes . it very little scent easy smooth . if i one suggestion make , it would philosophy sell it larger bottles one bottle generally only lasts me month .	1

resolution feels wonderfully luxurious skin relatively economical you need only little your whole face neck - regular size pot lasts me two months . it leaves you super soft feeling " pampered " skin , you apply makeup rightaway . promised anti-wrinkle effect , i am not too sure . i think great deal effect kind temporary plumping or masking wrinkles immediately after application which fades after couple hours , especially makeup . but overall , i think it helps keep skin somehow glowing i am quite satisfied this nice quality day night cream someone my age ( slightly younger-looking 37 ) . maybe i should also mention i am quite prone allergies sensitive reactions haven't noticed any adversities this products two years use	1

even though this scrub reminds me teenage days , when skin would act if it attacked my own face , trying get away , i still love using it fight occasional blemishes . there nothing this mighty warrior cannot when it comes cleansing purging skin clogged pores dry patches . i don't suggest treating face like floor , scrubbing away until polish wears off , but good scrub least once week normal oily skin not only beneficial but also very relaxing let me just say scent itself makes me feel healthier all ready . i still get this , not only because my fond memories but it ability perk up refresh my skin , especially before mask sunday night right before bed . i love fresh piney scent scrub its creamy consistency marred real ground tea leaves . tea tree found parts south east asia , new zealand australia . small shrub survive places where other vegetation fails flourish . there over hundred eighty species tea tree , only oil steam-distilled single species melaleuca alternifolia used commercially it only found northern new south wales . since it discovery oil called first aid kit bottle , not used moisturizer but deep cleanser antiseptic it also used treat pimples , burns , stings , toot aches , gum infections various other unpleasant occurrences . without cleansing scrubs , skin would take twenty five days wear off , not mention daily doses makeup , pollution , smoke , mixture sebum dead skin , dust , dirt collect top , they trap healthy layers promote patches redness irritation , not mention breakouts unhealthy environment one part our bodies represents us so well definitely bad idea . scrubs such tea tree oil one not only natural but also gentle enough not harm over strip skin when used accordingly skin type user . get most scrub , quick steam bath also very nice ; i cover my head clean towel lean over bowl hot water some chamomile tea it five minutes . i don't put my face too close avoid getting my skin burned but it very relaxing great pore opener before scrub mask . - kasia .	1

moisturizing but not greasy . absorbs well , but give it little time before you put mascara . skin under my eyes more supple , crows-feet appear less noticeable , i think because moisturizing . stings little if you get it too close your eyes .	1
i bought this because i love name i got it i like it lot it pretty pricey $35+ big bottle ... i got big bottle small bottle .. i like them look little funny could definetly smell better but good produc	1

this clean-smelling , refined fragrance stays all day long . i recommend it everyone loving fragrances such " costume national " like . package reached italy couple weeks standard shipping , suitably packed up , free samples included . besides , european shoppers may rely profitable exchange rate . far i'm concerned , i advise everyone trust beautiful perfumes amazon.com	1
this far my favorite lip gloss i've ever tried . it not gooey or gloppy , one previous reviewer mentioned . each color unique , but blends well most skin tones ( i am freelance makeup artist , so i used these colors varying people ) . if you use just dab , it even last through my hours gym , definitely adds just right shine photo shoot . it may tad expensive but worth it . my one gripe -- they really discontinue my favorite flavor color , sin ?	1
this stuff really works . this only product i ever used my life gives me this shine soft texture . i always use salon brand products , hot oil treatment , treatment salons they never this noticeable . i like smell . it nothing familiar or fruity . it natural scent . i like it . i would definitely buy this brought again . i wish product little bigger though .	1
i dry , fine , difficult hair tried ( no kidding ) just every product claiming add volume body hair like mine . specialty stores prescription items - i've found few work somewhat . i depend conditioners most important product my hair regime because conditioner you use greatest impact how your hair turns out day .... trust me - i know . i've got this hair product thing down science . i used two lush products this morning : big shampoo retread . holy **** - what difference . i am so happy right now - you should see how good my hair looks today - i used this first time this morning here some key points : 1 . you only use very little bit ( i hair past my shoulders i only used 2 teaspoons ) . 2 . product smells like heaven . it got affluent expensive natural smell - not perfumey dimestore smell . 3 . frangrance lingers - i've guys tell me how good i smell . 4 . after using other product " big shampoo ( or hair ) " - my hair thick , soft , shiny , silky , lots movement - no static . 5 . this conditioner gives me perfect moisture balance ( my hair anyway - i very thin , fine , dry hair ) . far lush overall : let me first state i am no way affiliated lush - i placed order over $100 worth lush products this one products order . only negative thing shipping turnaround ( little over 3 weeks ) but when my lush items came - i didn't care . scent all products gorgeous !!! it made all natural products actually smell awesome last throughout day . not too perfumey all but definitely recognizable others . i guys commenting all day how good i smell !!!!! packaging delightful , product presentation adorable , quality better than i've ever experienced . better than benefit , better than philosophy , etc . i buy try just every new product line comes out - some i like some i don't . i tell you this line my new favorite ! i'm going stock up everything they because not only products work , they so pretty look i use them decorations my bathroom !!! customer service extremely responsive doesn't reply form letters your concerns questions . they said they working improve their shipping times very accomodating . they also gave me some nice coupons my order ! 10 stars out 5	1

prada perfume authentic packaging genuine . only problem picture shown website not what i received . i expected receive bottle atomizer , but it not . there no way know this picture or description provided . i highly recommend perfume good value smells divine .	1
when i used dye my hair this only in-shower conditioner gave me perfect results every time ! not too over-ladden oil or weighed down , but perfectly moisturized ! only thing you may not like scent . it different than normal floral or fruity scents most conditioners . i personally liked it , but i see how some people wouldn't go musky , almost smoky scent comes most ojon hair products .	1
i am " product freak " .... always looking best creams lotions such my somewhat aging yet still " combination " skin . ( i 41 this spring ) i got sample this moisturizer part nifty lancome gift-with-purchase .. i love it !!!!!! it absorbs quickly , isnt too watery , not too rich .. not greasy feeling all , my skin just plumped right up got very pink dewy after i applied it . very soothing feeling ! its pricey , but i highly recommend it , purchase this when my ( good sized ! ) sample runs out !	1
ok , i admit philosophy line products best i ever used . trust me , i used them all ! self proclaimed makeup expert here !! just ask any my friends . philosophy microdelivery peel daily peel pads best little pads remove any lingering cleanser , prepare your face philosophy serum , moisturizer . these pads just full ingredients help sluff off dead cells , let your new bright cells step forward . once you try this product , you never want apply your makeup products without this first	1
i jus recently purchased these pads . i using philosophy skin care more than year now , but feeling like line needing toner like product help exfoliation daliy basis . well , this it ! pads very soft ( also very thin ) . i definately felt product working it made difference . i thinking product bit pricey , but then when i looking similar products other lines , i changed my thinking . i recommend this product	1
i may girl , but i love wearing this . i think it slightly lighter not sickly sweet like one women	1
ojon line best haircare line i tried so far . this best conditioner-ultimate moisture without weighing your hair down . if you chemically treat your hair , you need start using this line today	1
if you thick hair , or long hair , or both i , then this towel you . it seems little pricey just one towel , but believe me , it completely worth it . i hair hangs four inches below where my bra crosses my back it quite thick . after ten minutes regular towel turban , my hair still drips profusely . after ten minutes aquis towel , outer surface my hair almost dry touch ! not mention towel holds turban perfectly - normal towels so heavy i must keep my head upright keep turban place . aquis , i bend over or swing my head around turban not come undone or fall off . i don't like use hair dryers because it extremely damaging your hair ; acquis , there less need because my hair half dry after few minutes it . also , i've noticed my hair lot more volume when i dry it aquis . i could see how people thin or very short hair would not get full benefit this towel because normal towel works well enough them ; but if you lot hair , this towel just like magic	1
this only product keeps my hair drying into fuzzy , frizzy mess . i technically straight hair , but it misbehaves lot bit unruly . this called balm , but it more like thick liquid i apply wet hair . phytodefrisant i really see results after i blow dry . even if i let my hair air dry , i still see less frizz my hair softer . i would not live without this stuff over winter , especially dry hair static woes ahead	1
... my suprise though , it wonderful ! i didn't buy this product amazon.com, i picked it up sephoria mall . this product bit expensive , but so far , it worth it . i've using 5 days now , you apply it wet hair , after shampoing . when you , you feel your hair becoming so smooth shiny . i love this product so far , it all natural too it really work . it isn't going make your hair 100% straight , no , i gave up long time ago . what it going straighten hair enough , make it managable , beautiful . once , i don ' thave hide behind my hat :) buy again	1

i hunt years find best mascara out there ! this definatly top my list . i recommend this product its great long lasting , but only thing i didn't like it end day it started flaking little bit . other than its one best mascaras market	1
past several years , i've using mineral powders my sensitive , acne-prone face instead liquid makeup . i liked some better than others , but then i tried this powder clinique . it fantastic ! seems more natural than any other makeup i've tried , it go extremely sheer much coverage you could possible want , just adding more . i love it	1
i've tried lot compacts find combination coverage yet natural looking . before clinique perfectly real compact , i used bare minerals . order get coverage i wanted , it took long time after couple applications brush my skin started dry out saw little bits flake . clinique compact , it quick totally natural looking great coverage . i use sponge areas where i need little bit more coverage then use brush rest my face . it really great . my face doesnt look like makeup caked . but warning ; if you not know your color , i recommend going couple different department stores getting consultations perfect color your skin . when i went find color my compact , i got recommendations ranging 104 116 . some workers really don't know what they're talking . i ended up buying 106 this one worker recommended 116 , which huge difference . really try find perfect color because your skin look more natural money time wouldn't wasted	1

i wasn't sure how i would fare this product , but i am so glad i tried it ! here tip : i used first aid tape ( fabric kind , not kind really sticky adhesive ) i taped stencil onto my brow . it took little maneuvering position stencil just right place , but i taped stencil down brushed powder . then i other eye . i recommend using stencils both sides first then doing plucking , because i tried plucking right after removing stencil first side , i actually overplucked tiny bit . ( i able mask almost indetectable difference two sides this morning when i put my makeup using just teeny bit brown powder wax ... i live texas even humidity powder stayed put not smudge ! ) overall , this not snap use , but definitely worth effort , i even got compliments my brows my coworkers who thought i them professionally . i bought this kit price my brows waxed twice salon . i am very happy purchase would highly recommend it	1
i saw her oprah immediately wanted this kit my unruly , thick brows . i always struggled maintain nice arched shape always mess up plucking my brows . it bit difficult use plastic shapers myself , but they helped me lot see correct shape pluck . shading powder really helpful shaping too . it sleek little compact kit helped me home maintenance	1
ive tried all supposed best moment , breakthrough skin care , anti-aging , anti-wrinkle products past 5 yrs , i just keep going back la mer . i use other products least six months reap their full benefits , honestly , my skin looks its most radiant best when im back la mer . i just stopped trying out other products now since its only la mer brings best results . my skin always looks radiant dewey . terms wrinkle improvement , there only cosmetic change due fact your skin look moist , which lessens appearance lines . lines pronounced when skin dry , thus all moisturizers work keeping skin moist which gives you illusion less lines . but this product truly best among all !!! nothing else	1
i've tried them all , this one best . using it four years now . i am 37 year old guy i pass 30 all time . i am surprised say this crap really work !	1

if you're like me your scalp itches like crazy after you get your color , nioxin system scalp therapy answer . ( numbers only represent type hair you , use lower number if your hair more fine . ) use this once or two times after color , scalp itch goes away . product claims help thinning hair . i no issue , i think i found " off-market " use product , but it works me so i'll take it	1

if you haven't tried solid shampoo before , you definitely should ! great camping , travelling , bringing gym , or just using everyday shampoo . cut down bringing whole bag full bath products gym , i use this shampoo soap , it works wonderfully both purposes . this shampoo leaves my hair far less tangled than most shampoos i use , so if you don't often use conditioner , you probably won't need it if you use this shampoo ! smell , course , grand - if you've smelled other karma-scented products lush , you'll know this . it unisex kind scent , so i fight over it my husband when we travel . much better than those little bottles foul-smelling shampoo bath gel you get most hotels . earthy , citrusy smell lemongrass , orange , lavendar , pine wonderful way wake up morning . if you go lush store , you usually get free tin store your shampoo bars if you buy 2 bars	1
i'm recent convert lush products i say i'm thrilled find this new shampoo . i started using this couple days ago i've noticed positive difference my hair . my hair wasn't total mess using silicone shampoos , but now i've changed brands i see potential my hair i didn't even know it . i shoulder length really thick hair few waves curls . i don't too much problem tangling begin . all i needed couple swipes down my hair this lather right up . it smells awesome shower . lush describes it oranges bowl spices ; i'm not so sure but it definately smells kind foresty nice . it rinsed off very well hot water i followed jungle conditioner . hours later day i stil smell komba shampoo wafting around my head . it amazing . i've never shampoo stick me like this my hair feels light shiny just clean . no matter how much i try clean regular shampoo my hair it seems weigh it down . my boyfriend mentioned today my hair looked much less " poofy " . this just amazing . i would reccomend keeping shampoo airtight container . keeping it shelf where any water hit it deteriorate its longevity . i keep mine very tiny tupperwear container shower . size bar small , but it go loooooong way .	1
i bought fantasy gift set ( fragrance , body souffl� jewellery box ) , wasn't really interested souffl� . i sensitive skin suffer migraines , so careful which products i use . but curiosity got better me , so i gave it try . non-shimmering lotion melted into my skin immediately - no stinging or rashes . fantasy scent - chocolate , cupcake , lychee , quince kiwi - subtle enough not overpower me , yet strong enough people comment my wonderful fragrance .

first i hesitant ante up $ purchase dermanew system , but after few friends raved it , i decided buy i t.t he system includes battery operated applicator tool ( batteries included ) , sponge tops tool , dermabrasion cream . you pop sponge top applicator , put cream it apply your dampened skin . i set timer 3 minutes work applicator around surface my skin . results great ! dead skin sloughed off , circulation stimulated results glowing soft skin . my skin looks lovely feels smooth touch . it felt soft wonderful after very first application ! dermanew sells other applicator sponges creams separately use applicator tool your hands fee t.t hough initial price tag seems high , this tool last years help you glowing skin ! i highly recommend it	1

... but i didn't care smell . it smell like beer i could smell it throughout day after i used it ( smell fades throughout day ) , but i guess if you like smell this shampoo , then it won't problem all . notice my hair shinier softer(which hard say my hair ) , but knock off star scent . cynthia sylvia stout shampoo just `okay ' i sticking rehab , big , i love juicy ( see my reviews ) . try smaller size bottle first , remember some products lush store smells different when you get them home	1
i bought this several other philosphy 3-in-1 products totally based their yummy smell , this probably my favorite ! it truly smells like melting strawberry milkshake made fresh strawberries whole milk ice cream . i never get tired smell ! i admit i only used this body wash , not shampoo or conditioner . i found combination products not work well my dry curly hair , so i cannot attest hair cleaning properties this product . i say i've using philosphy products my skin year , i love them . i found my skin slightly less dry since i switched my old product . i ( i've heard many others say this same thing ) found fragrance not linger strongly your skin after your shower . my husband never smells my flavor du jour my skin after my shower , i am glad , because i don't think strawberries clinique happy go well together . so if you concerned smelling like you stepped out dairy queen , don't	1

" burberry weekend , " she replied , her face melted into confident , self-satisfactory smile woman who knows she something woman wants . i excitedly told my husband what happened day , i am hoping he buy me some this incredible fragrance christmas .	1
this summer i using neutrogena tanning mousse medium . allure gave neutrogena product great review . i like it because like this product , it gives instant color while also including chemical develops tan over hours . however , i bleach my bath towels get out leftover mousse my legs after i get out shower night ( if i don't it gets my sheets . ) also , you work quickly your hands spread mousse before it streaks . then you clean it your fingernails . i tried this modelco spray sephora today . it goes very evenly , no hand blending needed . it lighter than medium neutrogena , which great bec i am very fair skinned . much easier apply , but costs lot more . i'll prob use it weekends because you spray all those hard reach areas . during week when i'm just doing my legs i'll stick cheaper neutrogena product .	1

burberry brit one my staple fragrances ... i'm my third bottle which my mother thankfully supplied me christmas this year . brit deep , warm vanilla amber scent , but it not sweet . it rich oh-so-slightly woody , creamy undertone . it fairly long-lasting too . if , like me , you're not big florals , you'll appreciate brit spicy amber glow . i don't find it particularly strong , but then my tastes fragrance run strong side ( long it not overpowering ) . i know i'll love this one years come .	1

we lose so much time over it - you know what i'm talking , you debaters scissors . tweezers - but god told me tell y'all rest your souls . thusly : proper nasal care only accomplished tweezers . yes , there pain . but pain holy child vanity , whom we must bow down	1

i purchased 07 sheer caramel , which pretty accurate description color ( warm medium brown ) . it very natural beautiful shade . it sheer name implies , but there still good amount color . smell pleasant sweet , smooth light texture . it coverage lipstick moisture gloss , without sticky . it kind like tinted lip balm , but color more substantial . it actually feels better my lips than balm . appearance semi-glossy , but not goopy looking like traditional gloss . there little bit sparkle , but it not chunky like glitter . i would prefer it not any sparkle all , which my only complaint ( why i gave it 4 stars instead 5 ) . i think formula shiny enough it doesn't need any added glimmer effect . honestly , i think cosmetics manufacturers gone overboard putting glitter virtually everything . enough already ! anyway , i still like this lipstick despite my sparkle hang-up . it packaged slim silver tube very chic , simple , easy apply .	1
happy heart - even better than original happy which bit more citrusy . i use it day or night . roll-on applicator great idea it small enough purse yet lasts lasts . it doesn't leak cap doesn't fall off either . even better , it doesn't seem trigger attacks my allergic friends .

this cologne very spicy perhaps one my favorites next burberry fragrance men . whereas burberry fragrance fruity , brit slightly different scent more floral certainly more spicy ( yet not heavy or complex london ) . something spicy i'm quite surprised how light this one comes across ( comparison london which just little too heavy me ) . i agree other reviewers say it still far very masculine indeed . vanilla immediately noticed , well more fruity undertones which only increase time passes ( " juicy green mandarin , " perhaps but you need poet sense it ... again , admittedly sweet ) . warning , this product not nearly citrus/lemon/orange burberry fragrance ; instead it follows london footsteps provides spiciness yet more minimal way . worn similar fashion , either formal affairs or casual ones , though i'd gather it selected most often casual ones ( i find similarity this chanel allure , yet i find allure much more pungent ... i love allure , but if you want something little more mellow night , this your product ) . sweet , spicy , deep complex brit marks itself my second favorite burberry line - sharing spot right top burberry fragrance ! worn daily without becoming tiring , feature which i think it holds over burberry fragrance whose citrus-sweet fragrance may become annoyance	1
this stuff great when my skin needs some hardcore moisturizing . it might feel greasy some , but when your skin very dry , it not like . if you feel it too heavy day wear , it work great nighttime treatment . it sort smells like oatmeal vanilla ice cream me	1

chanel aqualumiere lipstick , my opinion , best lipstick formula market . lipstick goes shiny lipgloss but texture lip balm . colors , though sheer , still good pigmentation ; sheerness actually benefit because it allows lipstick color blend well your natural lip color , lessening chance your lip color come out looking unnatural . aqualumiere line lipsticks need reapplied more often than less sheer lipstick , but lasting power still relatively high , reapplication less bother because lipstick texture . though i not tried all colors , pinks this formula -- waikiki particular -- strike me especially natural face-brightening	1

it hard find this product online places you'd think it would like sephora.com, gloss.com or neiman marcus.com . i am very happy found my favorite moisturizer amazon.com so now i don't brave crowds brick mortar sephora or , let say saks fifth avenue where they hawk you like carnival barkers . even sephora salespeople become more aggressive than their original philosophy letting customer browse uninterrupted . this moisturizer perfect if you hate anything greasy your skin . it light , yet truly moisturizes least sticky stinky any i've ever tried . if you even get one or 2 pimples other moisturizers , you won't worry using this one . great oily or combination skin . i'm forty i still love it ! anything else slides off or makes me break out . only annoying thing my boyfriend uses most it	1

i reluctant get this one because it one few i already familiar ole high school days , many same reasons other reviewer stated , it around long time many already good or bad associations scent other guys who worn it . i understand why he gave it three stars , but i'm here review it based its scent merits not pop-culture story surrounds it . fact , guy laroche nailed almost perfect scent right eve fragrance men explosion . while its polo green counterpart tended smell more me like pesticide bottle , this cologne both decidedly masculine decidedly beautiful same time . it elegance blatant animalism . it musky spicy without floral or citrusy . age popularity generation ( zeroing age ) associated it probably prevent me overusing it , but it still ranks very high scent tests woman , possibly continuing best fragrance out there . synthetic scent other reviewer mentioned , this probably last made before manipulation benzene aromatics very common most newer colognes he probably likes lot . most likely its lack organic citrus notes caused statement . it not hip or newest thing , but damn it smell good !	1
tweezerman tweezers far best tweezers i've ever purchased . they stay sharp incredibly long time making tweezing precise , quick virtually painless . when they go dull , all you send them free sharpening week or so , they arrive back good new . you can't beat !	1
tweezerman really best tweezers market say , cutest . different colors choose , fact they're reliable strong only adds them . tweezers gone dull you need them sharpened ? you don't need go store anymore buy new ones . tweezerman sharpens them free charge sh so long you send envelope . my final point : i don't see point buying any other tweezer since you buy one pair it lasts you rest your life	1
i using it ... uhh .. fifteen years ?! it best blend sweetness , spice , musk character i ever smelled . there so many perfumes , especially last decade , launched , they all smell so similar ! they so little character , if they , then they either too weird , or too something . or they give me headache . this one unique . guaranteed .	1
gives you natural , sensuous pout opposed thick layer color ( which some lipsticks require ) only make your face look sharp . not good ( smart ) sharp , but opposite sweet feminine sort sharp . tastes smells nice too :)	1
i dark circles since i young . i got older ( im 38 now ) it seemed get darker . i am makeup artist profession , so believe me when i say i tried all kinds concealers . some went smooth but coverage didnot last mid-day there those dark circles again . i literally carry concealer me because i reapply atleast 3 times day . heavier concealers worked when i put them but after awhile it would cake under my eyes , dry out make my lines more visible really made me look older ! i hesitant hylexin , like everyone , because price . i started using it but didnt see any results after few days . i guess it didnt help i constantly looking mirror . i started get disappointed but kept using it . i swear 3rd-4th week i could actually see difference ! my circles way lighter less noticeable ! i dont " bags " or puffiness , just dark circles i olive skin . i continue use it , it seems getter better better . it might not take it away completely , but it sure faded enough i now use concealer ( or just fuller coverage foundation ! ) not worry it fading or caking . i feel bad some people may not gotten results they hoped , but what you loose ! yeah $95 alot , but its cheaper not invasive surgery . it same 50/50 chance cosmetic procedures . everyones skin different reacts differently like any other skincare/cosmetics product . also , you need follow instructions exactly ! i applied twice day didnot skip any application . i tried very hard stay out sun used my same skincare routine . i post review few weeks see if circles improved anymore . i hope this review helped	1

i bought this stuff after reading all great reviews . my hair 4b very thick . i hadn't perm almost year half . i put it myself followed directions exactly . past , i've really bad problems relaxers burning my scalp point i've scabs all over my head . that reason why i tried this product . it burn , but not nearly bad other relaxers my stylist used . it extremely manageable not very uncomfortable . i only left product my hair 25 minutes it recommends . it took something like 12 shampoos stuff neutralize . my hair turned out curly instead straight . guess i didn't " smooth " well enough . i would def recommend stylist put it you so you get great results . my hair looks really great flat ironed , but true test come after i've perm few weeks . my hair typically breaks off really bad right around time i need retouch . i am hoping doesn't happen w/this product . really let me know if it worth 60 bucks	1
i am african-american female long , thick hair . i relax highlight my hair , so imagine hell i when i heard you should not chemically treat your hair when you pregnant . i tried go , however after 8 weeks i dire need something . i searched web safe product found this relaxer . after rinsing it out using phyto shampoo conditioner i horrified fact my hair felt like straw . i rewashed it keracare shampoo conditioner it felt normal again . phyto relaxer same thing cheap drugstore relaxer , however it pleasant scent doesn't burn your scalp . after doing 2 or 3 relaxers myself i started notice breakage . but i assumed it pregnant . i stopped doing my own relaxers when my belly started weigh me down entirely too much . i called phyto they gave me listing salons use relaxer clients . salon i went explained me i didn't understand placement when it comes relaxer . i pretty much overlapping product onto previously relaxed hair . instructions say not it , but it really hard control . i continued going salon relaxers my hair grew back . now year later , i continue use salon product . i am breastfeeding my son , so i stay away chemicals still . i suggest this relaxer all my pregnant friends don't want walk around crazy hair . i mean pregnancy makes you feel bad enough	1
i highly reccomend this kit . i am esthetician lots trouble hormonal breakouts my chin , jawline neck . i using system benzoyl peroxide just too drying , even though i oily skin type . this kit great . all products full size ( except samples peels ) . products very concentrated , so i expect this kit last around 3 months . i noticed immediate difference my skin - brighter , firmer , healthier glow . i've now using it two weeks . i've few hormonal breakouts ( right before my period ) but they very small clear up much faster . it really getting rid red scarring left over previous breakouts my fine lines around my eyes certainly decreasing too . sample peels kit awesome . you get 2 peels out each sample set - so total 6 treatments . i reccomend using peels 2x week get you started - it really kicks up results	1
this product i use after i wash my face , i leave instructed five minutes , then i rinse then apply my night gel ( any product cream ) , however , i using this past three weeks , i already told friends my face looks great , what i doing different .. so this i give this product thumbs up !!	1
i've never review online product-but i can't rave enough khoret amen hair oil . i've using healthy hair butter my relaxed hair it fabulous ! it great moisturizing your scalp ends ( just use little dab though-it oil so don't over it ! ) . plus , my hubby really , really likes scent	1
little pricey , but well worth it . gives me charge morning really wakes me up ! makes you feel cool tingly all over i find i just want keep scrubbing !!! great product summer , b/c cool feeling you get even lasts while after you get out shower . also , it seems concentrated so you don't need lot it . would liked it even more if it little more moisturizing . if not , price , i would given it " perfect 5 " score	1
i give this product 4.5 stars . i long wavy/straight hair . it gets really frizzy humid weather i used use john frieda serum , worked well me . bottle just really small i would run out fast because my long hair . i decided buy this product . it thinner consistency than john frieda serum but it works just well . it make my hair soft it tames flyaways , but i would not use this product alone my hair . i usually put little this before i blowdry , little afterwards then i put bed head after party my hair before i straight iron my hair . both bed head biosilk really sink into my hair gets absorbed never looks greasy . after i , my hair super soft . i like bottle good size considering you only need like dime sized amount but i think it little pricey . but considering how long it last , i think it worth it . i would never use this my skin ( it says you use this your skin ) just because i would feel like i am putting oil or something my skin . it also smells little like hair spray , but it not overpowering . once you put it your hair , you cannot smell it . all all , great product .	1
i getting irritated skin / razor bumps / ingrown hairs ( whole nine yards ) ever since i started shaving . i've tried different cartridges , different methods shaving , even cutthroat razor ( give up right away -- much too much maintenance ) . however , purchase this merkur hd safety razor , i've finally found product i stick . people say it takes some getting used , but i found it not slightest bit more difficult than shaving cartridge razor . i get closest shaves ever it , practically no irritation . other pluses include blades last nearly week only cost 50 cents piece !! cartridges costing up three dollars , it time go old school ( especially since i'm poor college student ) . i can't compare this model other safety razors , but i say it great intro safety razor . good weight , simple use . i would definitely recommend this razor anyone fed up cost cartridges , looking simple , effective solution	1
this ideal razor start shaving if learning use double edge safety razor . there no adjustments cause confusion , non-slip grip indentations , well balanced , quality , well priced . one always upgrade merkur futur , vision , or progress models if one wants adjustable razor . this my favorite one futur 2nd . happy shaving	1
although expensive , this product produces results while other cheaper ones i've tried simply not . every now then i get few zits which don't bother me really . what bothers me dark spot lasts months after pimple gone . oxygen peel drastically reduces blotchiness hyperpigmentation . soon i rinse stuff off my face i'm always amazed look mirror see results . this stuff help keep your pores clean also . i would recommend using this product every couple weeks definately before big event ( pictures etc ) . basically you put gel over your face then add hydrogen peroxide cream , whole thing foams up , you wait 1-3 minutes ( intense tingling experienced times ) then rinse . some people say 1/2 amount recommended so product last longer but i didn't really find it worth it .	1

these glosses so beautiful . they coat most lucious way plus they don't leave you feeling like you tar your lips . thing colors don't look artificial . so many times gloss make you look like clown if you pick wrong color . however this just looks awesome . it stays you while too . only thumbs down taste factor . i expect glosses flavorful these aren't . but all grandeur product , i can't give it less than 5 stars . note buyers : colors here aren't actual colors . like sun bronze lot lighter glistens . miracle also pale shade sparkling pink . bright side every color looks good everyone so buy buy buy ! little pricy but worth it compared how long it lasts compared all other duds out there .	1
my daughter i love this product . we both love scent way it lathers i love way it feels my skin . i use it again again	1
smells fantsatic . exactly like cinnamon buns fresh out oven . also lathers well produces wonderful bubble bath . this one my all time favorites	1
i love smell this it fresh new smelling ( young lady type perfume ) i get compliments it lady once smelled it me went straight back out line came back bought it because she liked it soooo much ( i work dept store ) if you like watery fresh clean touch flower type sent u love this	1
i've used many other facial lotions before but none compare this one . such high quality product	1
this product works wonders over winter months . i didn't realize how it prevents dry skin until after i stopped using it few days during winter . my experience , this product doesn't leave oily film your face or make you shine hours under lights . unlike other products , i don't feel like teenager going thru acne again . price quality worth it amount you need apply makes cost per application comparable other products	1
i love this stuff ! too bad it so pricey ( my pocketbook , anyways ) . i long , fine hair tangles so easily . this stuff works magic it . changes texture it soft . you dont need use much it -- dimes worth , so even if it expensive , you know its gonna last you long time . def worth it	1
i love this stuff ! pink high cheek bone really lifts your whole face darker line beneath , gave my face fantastic elegant look . definite red carpet feel , although i wear it everyday . o-o ne quite work out why i look so good , i'm sure everyone thinks i've botox ....	1
i honestly thought i going give this one lower star rating . upon receiving this item mail , i dove right . one drawback immediately hit me smell . it basically smells like mint toothpaste . i knew it going minty , just not quite so minty . so i smoothed some rubbed it up my ankles . sensation very cool i surprised how oily slippery my feet . i'm used most feet creams sinking kind dissapearing . so , my initial thought pleasant , but kind wierd . now i say though , soother moisterizer it works great . my feet very soft it works rough parts me feet very well . i'm excited try this exfoliater some sort . i took away one start toothpaste smell , but really this awesome product . summer i'll probably keep this stuff fridge . i imagine it would feel great when really really cold after long day work	1
my husband i take pot then when we go holiday , after long day walking around , we come home sore feet massage each other fair trade until we feel we stand up again . it brilliant stuff , probably only way we've made it back out hotel dinner some nights	1

so i read all reviews here before purchasing it decided i'd give it go due all good feedback ... i'm so glad i ! i've regular lancome mascara user awhile- started definicils , went l'extreme , but this what i'm sticking . my lashes look loooong ... that saying lot because i some pretty puny lashes . not only it lengthen , but it seperates thickens . i also bought cils booster ( i think that what it called - it lancome mascara primer ) my lashes just pop . great product	1
i oily asian skin i tried other lush facial cleansers ( fresh farmacy , angels bare skin , aquamarina ) this one greatly improved quality my facial skin . i use it once day after coming work before going bed . it just taken care my skin . i've late nights , stressful times , lack sleep , sometimes i haven't able wash my face all . top it off , i'm smoker . since using this product , i've gone through those i've only gotten 3 pimples . when happens me , my face usually peppered blackheads pimples . herbalism really taken care my facial skin . this stuff exquisite keeper	1

i love this day cream . it smells great hydrates beautifully without looking greasy . only downfall it doesn't spf , so you apply additional sunscreen over it . its treatment qualities , i think it made my skin somewhat more radiant smoother , it didn't make me break out . it great product price	1
this stuff costly but little it goes long way . texture this perfect . it creamy but not overly moist . it sets nicely natural dewy finish medium coverage . it never looks cakey or overly like other medium formulations . i use dallop size quarter almost week . rate i think bottle should last very long time . its also only brand perfectly matches my very fair skin ( course how it matches you depends entirely you ! )	1
this foundation worth every penny . it make your face feel firmer look younger first use . don't ask me how it works , i don't know , but tiny lines around my eyes disappeared . also , it holds up against heat , sweat , tears . it doesn't rub off your clothes , either . only way i'll ever leave this foundation if dior themselves come up new improved formula , which i can't see happening . try it counter , walk around look yourself mirror . you'll say , " wow , amazing ! " too	1
i love patchouli . unfortunately , it very hard find pure form . often it mixed other perfume scents . body shop offers wonderful products this perfume oil no exception . i only hope they continue offering this scent . try it , you won't disappointed	1

i discovered caswell-massey line accident ; bought brushless burma shave internet provider . when i ran out i searched " amazon " first discovered this product . any rate , i believe scent accurate . addition , preshave oil followed their sandlewood shaving cream gives one close shave i ever experienced . used suffer 5:00 " shadow " , sales this unsightly ; after using c.m. product thing pas t.t his excellent product expensive . however , hot , wet lather shave this reviewer makes this mundane chore pleasurable . badger hair shaving brush nice addition or it makes great gift . british concern , truefitt hill also interest shaving personal care customers	1
this soap great ! it smells like ocean , really ! seaweed sea salt gently exfoliate your skin , pine , lime , lavendar give it really fresh scent leave you feeling clean rejuvenated after washing it . i'm going buy big old chunk this stuff next time i go lush , then cut it myself into chunk soap that mostly seawee/sea salt , use scrubbing shower , that mostly glycerine , just washing my hands kitchen/bathroom sinks . smell great , so i can't limit myself only using it once day shower , right ? right ! this stuff lathers up better than most other lush soaps i've tried . scent perfect women or men - very unisex , which nice . i really don't like most flowery , female scents . even my husband used this stuff	1

i love consistency this lip balm . it light , not sticky . smell this balm reminds me lemon bars , i love i t.t he reason 4/5 stars two things . sometimes smell little overwhelming . this entirely personal preference , only something happens some time . other reason balm tends not last very long me , i find little annoying . i usually just reapply , but means i end up using this up faster than lot glosses i used . i definitely am going buy this again , but knowing full well i'm just going buying it again sooner than i'd like	1

almost all colors this lip gloss comes very ordinary . very light pinks , frosty pinks oranges , browns basis colors . flirt , pixie , babydoll , whimsy , fantasy , piglet not very wide range colors , but they still nice . i'm not so sure oxygen , though . i never really seen silver lip gloss , so i don't know how it would look me . hello , people , why not make shade red ? red classic any lip color , so that color try . what dark pink ? or bright orange ? if you thinking coming out these colors already , great . but not , those some suggestions	1
my daughter very sensitive skin these great . they clean her face hands baths , don't irritate her skin all . i really like scent too . if you don't like way other mustela products smell you won't like these , but if you then you'll love them . my only complaint , reason they didn't get 5 stars , packaging . package tends not stay closed after few days . so if you aren't using wipes regularly they dry out	1
i using this product 3 weeks now . it definitely helped my acne-prone oily skin look more refined toned . only caveat product it mildly stings after you put it . i found it control oil production throughout day . overall , good product ! works well glycolic foaming cleanser	1
i've using this bar least 7 years ... absolute best color , best smell , most relaxing bath . i don't know what i'd if it discontinued !	1
