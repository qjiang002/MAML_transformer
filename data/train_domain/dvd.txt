my wife i , huge fans `america next top model ' `project runway ' , very excited seeing this film . why it took us this long still baffles me , but friday night we pleasure seeing `the devil wears prada ' let me just say it quite pleasure . now , most if not all praise heaped shoulders meryl streep , while she outstanding , this film more than just meryl painted canvas . there four brilliant performances this film they all deserving praise . first anne hathaway who plays andrea sachs , young aspiring journalist who takes job working miranda priestly assistant `runway magazine ' . anne hathaway proves her performance she all grown up . no , that not take away her more adult roles more adult films like `havoc ' masterpiece `brokeback mountain ' , but here anne proves she adult comedy , not falling back into her teen goofiness made her famous `the princess diaries ' but keeping everything smart mature . she enough poise grace match wits miranda , she so elegantly . next up emily blunt who plays emily , miranda first assistant ( there two , andrea second ) . emily worked her butt off get where she , slaving unruly priestly it all pay off trip alongside miranda paris . only thing standing her way andrea , if andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly emily . emily blunt turns out i think best performance bunch she enough sass , enough attitude enough wit make her pop out screen stand out no matter who sharing screen her . stanley tucci also wonderfully here nigel , miranda second command . he there make sure everything perfect , also help andrea adjust . stanley always great backup work , playing second hand man just everyone , but here he really makes his performance his own owns it . he delivers some funniest lines film but he never feels like `token gay guy ' ... he needed this film , not filler , he commands his scenes really stands out amidst crowd . then , course , we meryl streep who plays ruthless tyrant known miranda priestly . what i most impressed way meryl underplays every word , every emotion , every scene , which not what i expected . i really expected her go all glen close reincarnate cruella but she didn't ( thankfully ) instead turned out one most inspired performances year . she must fun playing snooty self absorbed above all selfish editor-in-chief `runway ' . she lets us see inside her character briefly ( when crying over failed marriage ) but her character more shutting off feeling order succeed so we don't get see real miranda because we're not supposed . carried these four brilliant performances `the devil wears prada ' fabulous film make you laugh make you smile impress almost anyone . script brilliantly adapted lauren weisberger novel , while it not exact replica ( any adaptations these days ? ) it carries same wit but smoothes things out make it more approachable , my eyes , more enjoyable . bravo	1
this movie full memorable scenes , although it probably more than decade since i last saw it . it suspenseful without gory ... most memorable scene one absolutely chilling without ever showing drop blood . even though i'd read book knew outcome i edge my seat right finish	1
i utterly honest , i don't buy music cds anymore . so many bands hitting streets faster than i imagine , i honestly cannot keep up them all . music begins sound same , corporations seem their pre-determined hit prior public even forming their own opinion . those like simpsons , backstreet boys , even hip-hop artists blending together sound uniform , unoriginal , overly drab . i nearly lost my faith music , retreating some my older music like dmb , counting crows , travis , but then i found ... suns . stumbling around internet i discovered , shockingly , one videos their album called " romantic death " . it one most creative disturbing videos i seen quite some time . then it hit me , i couldn't get this song out my mind . throughout whole day i beat , lyrics , overall sensation song stuck my mind ... i only heard it once . like drug , i needed more . when i returned home evening i found song again couldn't stop listening it . first time long time , i found new band . then , i bought this album . knowing nothing band except " romantic death " song , i put this my dvd player continued impressed . their videos just smart their music . their tracks seem cover every genre music folk , rock , even hard edge . their lyrics seem well-considered , smart voice new generation . my favorites album : " must you "" romantic death " ( parental guidance suggested ) " lost home "" rockstop "" we tried " fact , every time i listen this album i find new song explore , new song jam way work ; new song enjoy ! those skeptical this band , i suggest this album test your tastes . not only it provide songs you burn onto other cds which allow friends family explore this band , but also all their energetic , original videos never see light day mtv , but watched leisure your dvd player . sun breath fresh air music industry this album finally got me out corporate rut seems plaguing this industry . " ... if rockstops , it'll all my fault ... " grade : ***** out *****	1
movie guy , who lot work no fun then feels sorry . that pretty much whole story . well , idea quite powerful but not new , characters " comics " style very primitive , jokes quite boring . actually what really amazing , it could've ok watch family movie , but few really tasteless jokes made it pg13 rated without adding any fun , so movie family values not appropriate kids . too boring adults , not appropriate kids , too much moral young crowd - i can't really think who might like it	-1
i often wonder if some if not most people writing rave reviews , 5 stars , really paid , biased , professionals pumping up movie increased dvd sales .	-1
i saw this movie years ago , but didn't remember much it , except some songs , basic story . i also saw " nights cabiria " , which story taken . i love musicals , i think shirley maclaine very talented . she very sweet charity hope valentine , one can't help wanting happy ending her . so why i think this movie awful ? first all , some dialogue so repetitious it became irritating -- how many times you listen charity say " fickle finger fate " over over without wanting hit mute button ? also , some scenes went -- especially elevator scene . -- intermission totally unnecessary . but worst disappointment me musical numbers . i didn't like any them --- they so far over top silly . bob fosse must thrown everything into them he could --- instead letting dancers songs carry numbers , he so much busyness all them -- too many people , costumes didn't fit story , silly moves -- they all went past point enjoyment . i fast forwarded thrua couple them just get them over . i never before any movie . this could so much better -- story good , charactors good -- but whole thing should toned down . movie could 30 minutes shorter if there some trimming . it entirely too long . also --- all stop action -- what all ? i know , i know -- it show progress story , but it distraction . i didn't like movie glad when it over .	-1
ok , this far most pathetic taping show ( although sweeney todd comes close second ) . where show ?! they cut out " glory " battle scene just actors come out look happy instead creepy like they should when they slow-mo battle scene ( not movie ... ) . also , where " i guess i'll miss man ? " that beautiful song cut movie why ? also what " prayer duck " many others !!! this far worst ladies gentlemen completely ruins show created stephen schwartz great bob fosse ! oh yeah , chita rivera " spread little sunshine " pathetic , players not convince me they creepy really wanted pippin " grand finale . " i this show it greatest show i've ever , but this dvd pathetic . don't waste your money costly price $19.99 , it should $7.99 because how many great songs scenes cut this show	-1
george clooney quentin tarantino got two worst actors all time . it sheer agony watch these nerds pretend macho tough guys . this whole flick akin getting gift-wrapped packagewrapped fanciest wrapping paper ... problem , often case tarantino robert rodriguez , ain't nothin ' inside package . get it ? these guys like worst movies managed become makers some worst movies ever . word shallow comes mind . there nothing there , i doubt there ever . however , said , i must give credit where credit due : juliette lewis , talented juliette lewis , terrific usual . good see harvey keitel his thing , same goes fred williamson , rarely seen michael parks ( this guy , way made some terrific country-type records back 60's--and we wish he'd more . he up there merle haggard my humble opinion ) , last but not least , beautiful salma hayek also this , although she hardly enough . she still curves back then . addition above , we could without all obvious crappy cgi effects end . stuff just doesn't work ; never . way , documentary full -tilt boogie waybetter than main feature .	-1
my son over 2 before we introduced videos . there definitely those which cater younger baby lots random images , but this one great it puppet shows little plot , well discrete integrated units each seasons . unlike some other be random visuals , here visuals truly support learning objective desired . concur other reviewers well this most robust video bonus features . it both puppet shows short learning video all seasons . no i didn't care commercial either ...	1
season 3 l-word far best ye t.t he character development story come so far since 1st season , even better than season 2 . they scaled back sex little bit , but when they put it , sparks really fly . i love l-word	1
i really enjoyed this film , basically coen bros . homage film noir genre . ( i always thought name funny , since it french , yet most famous directors german , like fritz lang , otto preminger , etc . :-)) . sure hand brothers this material shown how film unfolds cool , unhurried , nonchalant pace experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey . thornton great lead reticent , phlegmatic barber , if anything , he even more convincing hair than without -- even his hairpiece 50s-ish . :-) whole cast fine job their roles , both gandolfini shaloub couple show-stealing scenes . i found film climax complete surprise , tables turn unexpectedly barber , whom everything seems working out up till then . overall great film probably one coen bros . best . if you're coen bros . fan you won't find this one disappointment .	1
i loved thie movie ever since seeing it late night tv . i search long time find it video before dvd option i waiting impatiently release dvd since my vhs wearing out . gradual awakening young ta which girl truly right him sammy fong attempt disillusion his picture bride priceless although latter often cut out during late night broadcasts . ballet sublime even though you tell when they switched james shigeta professional dancer . afterall , it music story make this great .	1
james , you wrote : " ben weak , immature , stalker , lazy , bad taste women 21 unable tell his parents no when they ask him wear scuba suit their family friends . wow ! revolutionary film-making ... not ! " yes , ben weak , immature , bad taste women . his learning overcome his weakness , immaturity , bad taste women , then defy his family elaine family his coming age story . point movie . it went right over your head ! acting dead subject matter shocker when it came out ! how could you not love this movie ? maybe you need grow up little see value . watch it again few years . i think you change your low opinion this great classic movie over time .	1
maybe it because i never read book never heard hunter . thompson before this movie , but i found this movie unbearably boring so utterly pointless ! what point movie-making process while reading script aloud , they realize this isn't movie ? or maybe book couldn't made into commercial movie ? " story " if it called such , apparently journalist his fat hispanic friend ( called his lawyer ) who go las vegas write article some motorcycle race some sort or something . that completely irrelevant , because probably 5-10 minutes actually spent subject , additional 20 minutes most devoted guy actually trying accomplish task . rest just johnny depp main character rambling mindlessly variety subjects , most which deal drugs , or drug-related things . others nothing all anything . they quite literally taking every drug known mankind , movie chronicles them taking drugs . there some scenes which duo their hotel room , where " lawyer " freaks out bathtub threatens kill himself . other scenes , they hotel club , or restaurant . no matter where they , they always high some drug , johnny depp character ( thompson himself based his experience , under fake name ) rambling or talking very very quickly nonsensically . there cameos minor celebrities , some which world famous today . gary busey screen all three or four minutes highway sheriff who sexually harrasses jd character . tobey maguire even less hitchhiker who bails out car when he realizes duo stoned out their mind crazy . only moment which i great laugh beginning , where they hallucinating they attacked bats they drive down desert highway . when " lawyer " stops pick up hitchhiker , jd char says " we can't stop here ! this bat country ! " . line its delivery alone deserve movie its one miserable star . i expected better terry gilliam . if this movie attempting shocking or pro- or anti-drug or stylish or artistic some way , it obviously only most acquired taste , like group people who think consuming waste acquired taste . there no moral message here , nothing pro- or anti-drug , nothing shocking save these two aren't dead third day taking so many drugs , or stylish or artistic . not worst movie ever , but definitely one them . i don't know what orifice people pull this " great movie " idea out , but i'd like examine , find out why	-1
cheesy instructorthe instructor voice covers music background which turns you off going exercize , music itself monotonous beat not inline moves . instructor too fast follow .. cut it short i not recommend this anyone .. totally not professional	-1
off-hand , i can't think worse movie . ( i think nicolas cage some truly awesome work other films -- hey , he making buck , here . ) that all . 1/32 star , if possible	-1
movie title itself says lot , movie itself total scam , fools people rent or watch it . horrible directing , script performance . you'd better jump off empire state building late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie	-1
perhaps this video satisfy readers lincoln various works , such sacred place , messianic legacy , holy blood , holy grail , or least show them places discussed detail within those books . dvd probably fine asset those currently reading aforementioned books . however , it simply not successful stand-alone video or video da vinci code . narrator , mr. lincoln , takes us through quaint beautiful countryside languedoc , home cathar heresy albigensian crusade , points out some interesting details his wandering . yet he rarely ties details together into coherent picture , often makes comments would seem undercut very idea he intends create coherent picture . well , he relishes showing destruction wrought many these mysterious details treasure hunters vandals ( many inspired , it would seem , lincoln books ) repeatedly editorializes against their actions . i finally fell asleep around 90 minute mark --- i cannot imagine what else mr. lincoln could found drone remaining half hour .	-1
" con express " lots action it , which great because this hides poor writing uninteresting characters . unfortunately , action isn't enough , stunt pieces shoot-outs , audience tempted doze off . city heat productions isn't really known producing films highest quality , so usually i go easy them . if this big-budget company producing this , i'd inclined pan it entirely . but i wasn't expecting much got little more than i bargained . action , most part , pretty good but nothing competitive your usual dumb action movie . flanery vosloo perfectly casted , but everyone else seems stiff add any more flow movie . vosloo especially appears enjoying himself over-the-top bad guy hijacking train containing deadly chemicals . film moves fast contains shades better movies like under siege 2 , con air , spy game , speed . if you liked those , you probably won't mind this one too much . just go easy it	1
while some critics argue dan brown research reasoning certain historical points , one thing these da vinci " debunking " presentations never able refute this : downplaying feminine role western civilization christianity , primarily catholic church , fact church still considered mary magdalene common prostitute until just few short years ago : 1969 . nor it possible refute recent polymorphously perverse scandals rocked church after centuries suppression may everything doctrinal distortions dan brown brought out open serious review . this institution trouble because it seriously out balance itself cut off its spiritual nose despite its face downplaying or denigrating role women sacred beings bearers light , when their healthy presence needed more than ever corrective some these abuses scandals . dan brown world great service showing how feminine role divine written out 2000 years ago , help peter whose misogynistic views women plainly evident scriptures even today still , quite frankly , shocking debasing . sorry , but upon this " rock " male dominancy built church . thank you again , dan brown , bringing these matters into light day so people know more their authentic history or least their own research make up their own minds which spiritual path best them which ones built two millenniums worth manipulations , obscurations lies . these obscurations lies happened through efforts group petty , insecure misguided men down through centuries ensure their dominance control over masses , they found way dominate not only minds masses but their vast material resources , worth trillions , through guilt , control other hidden but consistent abuses power . those orthodox faith who continue blindly support such hypocritical institutions lot more answer than any twenty dan browns put together . people angry they angry failure religion live up its own standards behavior distorting what may jesus ' actual relationship women his life -- or disciples just supposed members exclusive men club jesus head women species relegated second class citizenship ? answer these questions , some you finally turn your own heart mind change instead some literal interpretation truth , because not everything light found scriptures or printed page , especially after scriptures selectively riddled scissors reasons self-interest or spiritual corruption . next thing people should ask vaults vatican thrown open public view . lord only knows what plunder they contain	1
my major gripe this film comes down issue easily exploitable weaknesses part vampires . these extremely frail villains get reduced ash flash u-v lamp , vaporized slightest touch silver their skin , melted down less than second light sun . vampires supposed scary , but how frightened them should i if one taken out throwing clove garlic him . writers future vampire movies should work making these creatures night bit more formidable . first underworld movie would good model .	1
highly acclaimed . , i knew . i watched first 30 minutes , which 1/4 movie , before i decided hang it up . new lady moves into conservative french town opens chocolate shop . this upsets local church , even before she begins unleashing secret desires so forth her sinful chocolate . okay . you really carry 2 hours this single plot ? nope . this one boring .	1
my main motivation seeing this movie better understand reputation echo park , little area nestled next downtown los angeles . i moved echo park late 2004 . it depressing - vicious cycle drugs , dropping-out , domestic violence . it all here , told through eyes latina teenagers . it easy see woman hand direction piece important roles women played . i didn't care movie whole because it felt sluggish uneven . i also found myself not caring any characters . so-and-so gets shot , la la loo goes jail . whatever ! aside , though , evil neighborhood druglord called ernesto . it turns out my next-door neighbor real-life also called ernesto . luckily , it just coincidence	1
this hugely disappointing film . i not see it stage nor i want if it ever resurrected . it trivializes illness , death , god , heaven , range human emotion love all forms . i grown up post-aids world see so many problems far worse than aids . i am tired listening actors drone selfish pursuits . while america focuses such banal subject matter , larger more urgent problems clearly ignored society thinks it luxury still trying come grips sexuality	-1
i recommended this movie friend here college , because he spoke so highly it , i thought i would just buy it instead rent it . i definitely regret decision . if you're thinking buying it - rent it first . it dull obnoxious , not mention weird . only entertaining part watching this film making fun it my roommate ( which why i gave it 1 star instead 0 ) . however , if you're still interested , definitely rent it , you might enjoy it .	-1
movie one my favorites , works both romantic level , comic level . but where widescreen ? todays consumers more educated ( thank god ) they've almost stopped asking stupid question " why watch widescreen , you lose top bottom movie ?! " they finally get you seeing more movie widescreen not less . so how i expected buy this dvd ? it all intents purposes " incomplete " . who going pay all something satisfied only getting some it ? buy this movie soon ws version becomes availible	-1
i don't want spoil this movie others i won't . cache french hidden alot left hidden . why son suddenly what he ? why he think his mother doing what he thinks she doing ? i didn't care one bit any charactors . this slow going movie no conclusion . if you choice watching this movie or watching paint dry , flip coin . i watch international films often usually fnd them more rewarding than most us made films . not this one .	-1
she sings acts like airhead , he acts like sams sort idiots who fight professional wrestkers league ... moment these two married 2002 , press talk shows all over them like vultures flying over carcass . so silly fools this stupid reality show mtv , destroying whatever change they might life together filmed every aspect their lives front camera , now today big surprise , simpson lachly getting divorsed . silly fools asked it end , it led heart break	-1
