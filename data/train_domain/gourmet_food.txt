i bought few bags these noodles after reading very favorable review them hungry girl website , i am glad i . they work well number different recipes , filling , add " calcium boost " dishes i use them , very few calories . these not " pasta " type noodles , course - texture different ( softer kind " slippery " ) , they virtually no flavor their own - they take flavor whatever sauce or dressing you use them . i probably won't use these noodles european-style or american-style sauces such marinara or cheese sauce - those types sauces created grain-based pastas , which these not . other hand , these noodles fine such asian recipes pad thai , lo mein dan-dan noodes ( basically , noodles spicy peanut or sesame sauce ) . there lot asian-style recipes cookbooks internet which fairly easy make , taste terrific , work beautifully these noodles . you prepare yourself real treat , if you use these noodles types recipes work well their texture , fraction calories you'd eat if using regular noodles or rice . short , if you attempt something like spaghetti meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles , you're likely disappointed , but if you use them pad thai , any type curry , other asian dishes , or most soups , you're likely find yourself enjoying delicious wonderfully low-cal , low-carb meal . one thing - when you open bag , there slight ammonia-like odor ( it smells ammonia-like me , anyway ) . if you rinse noodles well then parboil them few minutes , per package directions , odor really disappear . it not strong odor , it won't permeate your kitchen or anything like , but you definitely want rinse parboil noodles before using them . just follow package directions	-1

" their web site , tazo describes flavor profile lotus " peach , nutty , flowery , overripe melon . this surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend clean light-bodied , aroma reminiscent freesia . " tazo also describes aroma " tropical fruit , green tea " . hmmm ... i don't taste all these various flavors , i suspect tazo really pushes creative writing limit . i taste green tea , nice flowery flavor , which i'm assuming lotus , but not res t---t he peach , nuts , melon , freesia , tropical fruit---they're missing what i discern here . i would rate this tea , tazo general , good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi . i'm soooooo spoiled numi teas , which why tazo lotus gets only four stars . ***	-1

those us brought up vegemite , marmite doesn't make grade . those brought up marmite , vegemite seems poor substitute . americans who only seem put sweet stuff their cake ( oops , i mean " bread " ) both revolting . i think major reason why americans abhor these savoury spreads used spreading honey jam their breakfast toast , they tend use like quantities vegemite or marmite . uninitiated taste either spread applied so lavishly going overwhelming . before passing judgment these spreads , you would well heed advice " joanna " or " mtspace " apply thinly . it also works best very fresh bread or hot toast . incidentally , i believe marmite first . vegemite australian imitation created several years later . it originally called parwill - pun which appreciated aussies brits but which may not understood americans because way words pronounced . i only give marmite four stars . probably tells you my upbringing	-1

( once drink name started roll my kids ' tongues easily - i realized i spending too much money these drinks - daily ! )i am not familiar various grades matcha , but not want something pre-sweetened or modified because i wanted control sugar , etc . i make my frappuccino like this : sorry - i not measure - so you may modify these amounts because i am guessing ! 1 1/2c milk2 heaping spoonfuls ( spoon that included ) green tea powder1/8c simple syrup ( i make it myself keep fridge week or so)10+ice cubes ( adjust your taste - depends size cubes)blend this blender - longer than you think - pulse first then blend bit - i scrape down bit bc powder flies around little you don't want lose any . ( simple syrup 1c water , 1c sugar heated until sugar dissolves ) it much easier than it may sound - i make these daily morning . i hope this helps anyone else out there who addicted gt frappuccino - it slightly different ( i think they use different gt powder honeydew syrup ) , but i liked mine more within first week them !	1

i personally love crunchy cheetos , but if you look nutrition facts they're not really healthy . i love crunch cheesiness . everything cheetos great , i even love lick cheese off my fingers . although fat , salt , calorie , carbohyrdrate content extremely terrible , package may say 100% real chese , but its 100% real fake cheese . it like everyone loves chocolate , but it unhealthy . i don't advise you buy these snacks when you eat something healthier , perhaps bag low sodium pretzels or piece fruit . i think you should definintely eat cheetos least once while because they taste delicious , just not all time . i don't want sound like paranoid health inspector , i'm just giving you my personal opinion this product ! i lt ;3 cheetos	-1

**** tazo lotus decaffeinated green tea one my favorite tazo teas . lotus flower flavor pleasant delightful . this tea not bitter or harsh any way . it one most natural-tasting tazo i've tasted , very subtle , much less artificial-tasting . ingredients lotus : naturally decaffeinated green tea , natural lotus flower flavor other natural flavors . course , this tea caffeine-free . tazo interesting company makes only super premium teas . they socially responsible , based portland , motto , " reincarnation tea " . tazo owned starbucks . their web site fun quirky , zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . it unclear , though , their web site , how many their ingredients organic or kosher , they use some " natural flavors " their teas -- this wording seems little vague super premium tea . paper tea packet , tazo writes , " delightfully subtle green tea inner radiance essence lotus flower . " their web site , tazo describes flavor profile lotus " peach , nutty , flowery , overripe melon . this surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend clean light-bodied , aroma reminiscent freesia . " tazo also describes aroma " tropical fruit , green tea " . hmmm ... i don't taste all these various flavors , i suspect tazo really pushes creative writing limit . i taste green tea , nice flowery flavor , which i'm assuming lotus , but not res t---t he peach , nuts , melon , freesia , tropical fruit---they're missing what i discern here . i would rate this tea , tazo general , good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi . i'm soooooo spoiled numi teas , which why tazo lotus gets only four stars . ***	-1

twinkies rank high my list pure junk foods . sugar corn syrup twinkies help push calorie count around 150 . i not care think what kind fats carbs go 150 calories . other hand , i grew up twinkies . i used eat them fast i could get my hands them . unfortunately , i am unable any more . you get older , you get smarter , i guess . but i still like occasional twinkie . yes , they sweet . yes , they too many calories . but , they taste good ! i wish they still offered banana creme twinkies . more recently people actually enhanced calories twinkie deep frying them . cooking twinkie should something you only great care . there process successfully making deep fried twinkie , there many processes not work . best my knowledge all processes yield even more calories , but even better flavor . you get general idea . better twinkies taste , more calories they . go figure . twinkies their current form never mistaken health food . but i probably continue indulge one periodically long i . enjoy !	-1

**** tazo calm herbal infusion nice chamomile tea . i taste chamomile some flavorings , they not unpleasant , just hard pin down what they besides chamomile . general i'm not big fan tea flavorings added , preferring subtleness authentic taste real thing . ingredients calm : chamomile flowers , hibiscus flowers , spearmint , lemongrass , rose petals , blackberry leaves , safflowers , peppermint , sarsaparilla , lemon balm , licorice natural flavors . it caffeine-free ! tazo interesting company makes only super premium teas . they socially responsible , based portland , motto , " reincarnation tea " . tazo owned starbucks . their web site fun quirky , zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . it unclear , though , their web site , how many their ingredients organic or kosher , they use some " natural flavors " their teas -- this wording seems little vague super premium tea . paper tea packet , tazo writes , " soothing blend chamomile blossoms other relaxing herbs . " their web site , tazo describes flavor profile calm " creamy , floral , minty , toasty , sweet , honey-like . name gently implies , tazo calm lovely floral bouquet apple-like flavor distinct toasty notes . naturally sweet nice light way , smooth finish " . tazo describes aroma " minty , hay like , rose " . i don't taste all these various flavors , but i taste chamomile , it fine , not overwhelming or artificial tasting several other tazo teas i've sampled . i would rate this tea , tazo general , good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi . i'm soooooo spoiled numi teas , which why tazo calm gets only four stars . ***	-1

little while back , no one ever heard chipotle , other than people who make them . then suddenly dam burst chipotle came flooding into our land like spicy tide . we all love those smokey peppers , this point there really isn't anything you can't get chipotle it . chipotle peanut butter , chipotle caramel corn , chipotle coffee beans ... we inundated chipotle . so you might think this just chipotle hot sauce . how quaint , you think , chipotle product actually seems like it should chipotle it . you look your friends you all say " hey , let retro buy some chipotle hot sauce .

try this i am sure you like flovor . my family all texas . since i wee little tyke ( 60 years ago ) i remember my grandmother , effie , cooking gebhardt chili powder . nothing else would since effie ( who known all grannie ) taught my mom how cook ; gebhardt only chili powder any us would every use . okay , okay , so i try cut costs sometimes when i younger bought grocery store chili powders but taste definitely not same it seemed things cooked mess not edible either . i wish they would sell gebhardt bigger bottle because i usually 3 or 4 bottles my cupboard i am scared running out when i am middle cooking something great like red beans rice , or grannie mexican skillet , tamale pie , chili , red eye stew , stuffed peppes , omlette mexican , . grannie goulashcook 1 1/2 cups long grain rice ( i used texmati you end up 3 cups rice)note : i am vegetarian so i not use bacon grease anymore but it really good bacon grease instead vegetable oil . large skillet brown 1 pound ground meat some 4 tablspoons olive oil or corn oil when it starts getting almost browned , add 1 large chopped onion , 2 or 3 cloves garlic chopped , 1 large or two smal bell peppers 1/2 inch cubes ( add some chopped big hunks two ribs celery)(can use red bell peppers also ) . cook until onions sweated garlic well . low heat - add 4 tablespoons gebhardt chili powder ( least i use more ) if you some ground cumin put spoon too . stir it around so chili powder good absorption oil , salt pepper taste . you add packet sauzon achiote cilantro or packet azrafan but it not really necessary because disk takes its main flavor gebhardt'sif you get hold rotel tomatoes ( drain most water off ) , or you add 1.5 cups tomato sauce , or chopped tomatoes , or even thick tomato juice , salsa works good too . add 1.5 cups whole kernel corn ( i use frozen ) you put mexicorn it looks good too . 1 cup kidney or pinto beans or you made . stir this around simmer low heat until heated through . when it all heated put 1.5 cups 2 cups rice heat toss well but lightly so not mush rice . i serve this grated cheese top but you put cilantro , chopped tomato , sliced olives , avacado even plop sour cream . one dish meal easy clean up leftovers great next day omlette or tortilla . this recipe very fogiving so you pretty much use what you hand . grannie effie 6 children fed most neighborhood during drepression	1

i really like my senseo coffee maker . i , like others who reviewed kona pods here , always searching better tasting coffee pod use machine . i excited see kona now made pods also happy see they pod ' 2 cup style ' . i not found it huge deal use 2 smaller ' 1 cup ' size pods , but it sounded nice able just put one large pod machine instead 2 smaller one . after reading some reviews here , i could not figure out what some reviewers meant kona pods making different amount coffee per cup each time or how coffee could strange undrinkable . it just didn't make sense . well , it still doesn't make sense , but it certainly happened coffee i made using kona pods also . my results overall poor it very disappointing kona pods cost lot more than folgers or other pod brands i buy locally . first thing i noticed coffee 2 cup sized kona pods packed much more tightly than any other pod i ever used my senseo . instructions kona pods say wiggle pods break up coffee before inserting into machine . kona pods feel very hard when taken out their package . i always wiggled jiggled pods 10 seconds before putting them senseo . after my problems kona pods , my husband decided i not ' wiggling ' them enough . he promptly wiggled one point it broke open . so , there just so much pod before putting it machine . first thing i noticed amount coffee brewed when using kona pod quite bit less than when using 2 smaller pods . not make much sense , but after several cups kona , it obvious there never amount coffee coming out before when using 2 small one cup pods . best i figure out kona pods themselves seem ' hold ' lot more water . there more water remains pod itself after brewing . pod itself heavier when i take it out throw it away . so , i believe reason there less actual coffee using kona pods pods themselves retain lot more water it cannot pass through into coffee cup . then , others mentioned , there problem happens me 1/2 time when using kona pods . problem whatever reason , water not actually go through penetrate kona pods during brewing cycle . ' coffee ' supposed coming out spout just water ! this problem one i still cannot really figure out . kona pods little smaller diameter than all other pods i tried . so , i guess somehow water enough room ' go around ' actual pod come out spout without ' going through ' pod brew coffee . i also wonder if paper filter kona pods different than other pods some reason kona paper more difficult water penetrate . i tried wetting kona pod paper filter right before starting brew coffee thinking perhaps it would help water penetrate paper pod . but , not worked me . so , it back regular more reasonably priced coffee pods me . i wasted too many expensive kona pods trying get proper cup coffee them . even when kona pods brew cup coffee , it not large amount coffee i get using other brands . so , adding cost kona pods fact it brews smaller amount coffee equals product way too expensive when it actually work . i reading product called ecopod . it refillable pod these type coffeemakers . it might next thing i try .	-1
imagine giving fairly expensive gift no one knows you gave it . that what happened this one . completed order , wrote nice note note never arrived . maybe i should greatful they actually sent product . omaha steaks off my vendor list .	-1
i agree completely previous reviewer -- this licorice not even come close usual quality ofharibo candy . this stuff dry hard , it leaves your hands sticky waxy grease . flavor -- what little there -- just weird : kind fake floral . not recommended	-1
these " steaks " only distantly related real prime rib . they tasteless ( other than overly salted ) , texture reminiscent congealed soy protein , look even worse . omaha steaks bottom barrel when it comes mail order meats , yourself favor look elsewhere	-1
we used kona coffee pods year . they excellent . we found it more convenient order through amazon , shipment arrived more quickly . this last shipment , coffee often watery even though coffee unit functioning well . it hard know what these various boxes coffee remote supplier	-1
product description says this tea ' slightly sweet ' well bunch other descriptors , but i didn't get any sweetness all . i very optimistic because i normally love everything tazo offers , but this time i my hopes dashed . i brewed up mug this tea immediately alarmed bouquet . teabag smelled different , but once hot water hit it smell seemed really magnify . but i scooped few teaspoons sugar hoped best . i managed choke down third cup before i called it day . life too short drink something you don't like . however , i read review mentioned how good palatable this tea when combined tazo lotus . i figured it worth shot , otherwise i'd throw out this tea altogether . lotus smelled great , so i excited . i blended two bags ( one lotus one wild sweet orange ) large mug , then removed wild sweet orange after minute . i left lotus minute or two ( yeah , definitely two ) . result very unusual , but not unappealing , beverage . would i drink this more than once day ? no . it very interesting something i'll try again ? yes . live learn , i guess .	-1
i read other reviews greatly excited order this entree . i bought 2-3 varieties tasty bite my local trader joes . most decently healthy all easy fast make . peas paneer , entree , bland without any heat/spice . i am native indian so i handle relatively spicy food . however , this entree not merit even 2-chili rating ( out four ) . food quality , i would suggest microwaving rice entree separately . otherwise , majority sauce seeps into rice giving it very unpleasant appearance . if you boil pouches ( alternate option ) , you may even more success . however , most us buy these because ease preparation , so boiling isn't convenient option . rice tastes looks it should . finally , i recommend tasty bite entr�e , jaipur vegetables . i am box nine twelve still not tired . this entree much spicier - closer 3.25 chili rating ( out four ) . i also favor this entree because it doesn't throw-away plastic container each box . moreover , you get 12-boxes better price than 6-boxes peas paneer . i look forward trying other tasty bites , though i likely sample flavors trader joe before ordering 6- or 12-box set . no more tasty bite purchases gold box unless i already tried particular flavor - lesson learned	-1
i drinking green tea years , love not only taste but smell too . when i opened up box this tea i thought i standing over old ash tray ! it smells horrid doesn't infuse well into water . i steeped table spoon it five minutes water color barely changed . i highly recommend you not buy this tea . exotic product aside , plain old lipton green tea bags grocery store far better	-1

this cocoa gritty bitter taste . dark chocolate mint particularly bitter . we don't care chocolate raspberry chocolate vanilla flavors either . chocolate supreme flavor sweeter tastier than other flavors , but child our family still remarked his cocoa " tasted strange " . there many non-gourmet commercial mixes smoother , more palatable less expensive than this gourmet brand . we won't buy this cocoa again . this gift box selection very handsomely packaged looks great holiday gift baskets . but cocoa fails taste test .	-1

it ain't spaghetti , folks , but used properly it enhance your eating . it great wet , soupy type dish . eaten " " ( after rinsing ) noodles very soft tender , too soft pass dry italian type pasta , unless you always cook dry pasta death . boiling them minute or two firms them up somewhat , but they never become firm properly cooked dried pasta . reviewer who said pasta out due his/her type 2 diabetes ... it not ! i'm same boat , we still enjoy pasta , we just need measure it control carb servings always use whole grain types slow down sugar load . i weigh out 2 oz . before cooking 2 carb exchanges ( 1/2 cup serving measurement absurd because different types pasta fill cup differently ) , i use bulkier additions like chunky vegetables big salad side . oil vinegar salad dressing helps further temper blood sugar rush . course , if you eat lots carbs breakfast lunch , don't plan 2 carb servings pasta dinner . i given up ( white ) italian bread side ! that worst part , but pasta least do-able .	1
i read this product hungry girl website . it listed amazon supplier . i read all reviews decided place order . it took longer than i expected arrive , since i pay extra shipping i thought it would here sooner . extra shipping must cool pack box it shipped . noodles little chewier than regular pasta . but like regular pasta didn't really taste their own took taste what ever sauce you use . i really like them . diabetic , it great pasta alternative not raise my blood sugar . i didn't find unpleasant smell when i opened bag reviewer wrote . just same i rinse them well . i since found them local health food store so i won't pay high shipping any more . i not able find spaghetti type anywhere , only flat noodle type i would really like try spaghetti . i would recommend this product any one wants lower carb , lower calorie pasta	1

first time i encountered haribo gummi bears when i went germany semester overseas . i won bag these classroom prize . first , i thought these going ordinary gummy bears , but , boy i wrong . these candies truly step above all other gummy bears . germany , this brand gummy bears . competitors ' bags sold much lower prices , but few people buy them - that because difference quality taste noticeable . other people reviews regarding sweetness softness accurate . haribo found perfect combination . during rest my stay germany , i became huge consumer haribo candies . haribo sells other gummy candies , but their " gold bears " best . when i returned beautiful america , i disappointed find haribo not so easy acquire . they sold online other stores decent prices but after shipping , cost quite steep . i am truly excited see these bears offered amazon free super-saver shipping . if you never haribo gummi bears , you really need try some . 5-pound bag seems like large quantity , but i promise , you not disappointed	1

first all , i agree above reviewers who thought this wasn't great fruit dip . second , there very little marshmallow flavor-this stuff nothing like regular marshmallow fluff . however , i still give this 5 stars , because it got features you can't get anywhere else . texture smooth pudding ( grainy reviewer perhaps ate his past expiration date ? ) that mainly how i use this . because slightly sharp taste cellulose , this dip lends itself very well making citrus puddings ( just add 1/4 cup lemon concentrate stir , doesn't get any easier than ) . i also use it make cheesecake other dessert recipes . actually make good fruit dip out this , try mixing it yogurt or cream cheese	1

i am mom four , who tries balance limited grocery budget healthiest food my family eat . i keep making more more changes i gather more information products like this become so readily available . anyway , i concerned food dyes lately but still wanted my kids able some kind candy treat . i thought i would give these try . i just got them yesterday . i haven't given any kids yet ( i am saving them christmas ) , but i also didn't want wait until then find out kids they horrible . so , i performed my own taste test three flavors , i found them delicious . i know kids love them !	1

i bought few bags these noodles after reading very favorable review them hungry girl website , i am glad i . they work well number different recipes , filling , add " calcium boost " dishes i use them , very few calories . these not " pasta " type noodles , course - texture different ( softer kind " slippery " ) , they virtually no flavor their own - they take flavor whatever sauce or dressing you use them . i probably won't use these noodles european-style or american-style sauces such marinara or cheese sauce - those types sauces created grain-based pastas , which these not . other hand , these noodles fine such asian recipes pad thai , lo mein dan-dan noodes ( basically , noodles spicy peanut or sesame sauce ) . there lot asian-style recipes cookbooks internet which fairly easy make , taste terrific , work beautifully these noodles . you prepare yourself real treat , if you use these noodles types recipes work well their texture , fraction calories you'd eat if using regular noodles or rice . short , if you attempt something like spaghetti meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles , you're likely disappointed , but if you use them pad thai , any type curry , other asian dishes , or most soups , you're likely find yourself enjoying delicious wonderfully low-cal , low-carb meal . one thing - when you open bag , there slight ammonia-like odor ( it smells ammonia-like me , anyway ) . if you rinse noodles well then parboil them few minutes , per package directions , odor really disappear . it not strong odor , it won't permeate your kitchen or anything like , but you definitely want rinse parboil noodles before using them . just follow package directions	1

rings-ding best snacks out there many reasons . first off , they best after dinner snacks out there . it really like cake , just more condensed not fatty or filling . also , these things addicting . my life , i cannot even count how much packs i consumed , since i eating these things everyday since i young , let just say now i am very old . if you cannot afford drugs , then go ring-ding . only negative these things if there isn't enough cream , then you get mouthful chocolate . most people i know like chocolate , but i personally would not like mouthful it . bad thing summer , they melted only slightly revived if refrigerated . they kind lose good flavor edge summer , which makes this perfect snack winter . alright ... anatomy ring-ding ( dun-dun-dun ) . first off , you get chocolatey outside pretty soft . center creamy sensation ( sorry if sounded dirty ... get your mind out gutter ) really makes this product go good great . put together you get probably best snack out there right now . they come two pack made drake . usually , drake shadow hostess , yet i feel drake destroys hostess terms their cakes . if you actually reading this , please don't destroy me saying ring-ding totally annihilates anything hostess ever put out . wow ... i managed make food product two paragraphs long ( two short paragraphs i should say ) . i would put whole history ring-ding , but would probably taking someone else work . i guess i'll stop now . anyway , ring-ding win !!	1

we purchased this ramen store specializes asian food . there numerous varieties ramen so you try many them find those you think best flavor . we bit apprehensive first time we tried this ramen . however , it since become one our favorites . spice hot , but it adds really good flavor noodles . real winner when you mood spicy food , or cold day . because this ramen very hot , we also mixed package this ramen package chicken ramen lower chemical heat . even such mixture soup still fairly hot . when i say hot , i mean spicy hot . many people medium hot incredibly hot , but i barely discern any spice medium hot salsa . i am accustomed eating spicy mexican food korean food , so when i say this soup hot , you good reference	1
i love hot sauce . i big fan other " insane " hot sauces , but problem them most part , they cannot put directly food , instead , they need diluted before they're okay consumption . not this hot sauce . it perfectly hot enough , yet not too hot eat straight out bottle . i put it everything : burger too blah normal condiments , el yucateco fix it ! shrimp cocktail not kicking , el yucateco show those shrimp who boss . i even use it bring salsas up proper level heat . it definitely hot . if all you're used normal , red-colored vinegar water , this hot sauce open your eyes set your mouth fire . but , if you're looking something good flavor that'll keep you coming back more , this stuff .	1
these best berries i've ever tasted ! i thought sure they sweetened , but they're not . berries they used must perfectly ripe flavor just blasts your mouth when you try them . additionally , slices whole , very little breakage . value you get pretty great , considering 8oz berries approximately equivalent 5# fresh strawberries . $3/lb (+ shipping ) that really not bad , you these year-round , even when strawberries aren't season	1
these so delicious ! they gave great variety cakes . when i say cakes , i mean sense they're little asian rice balls filled sweet bean paste , either mung bean or red bean . they're yummy light . i didn't care strawberry/grape jelly cakes , they seemed like fillers , but rest tasted good . refridgerate thm after day if you don't eat them immediately . they might dry out if you leave them box .	1

product description calls orangettes " belgian vitamin . " except luxury price , i'm sure belgians must pretty healthy these around . they're amazing ! combination orange peel chocolate long popular , but leonidas it very well . dark chocolate very rich , not bitter , completely covers orange peel ( which retains good flavor isn't overly sweet ) . unlike other chocolatiers who often dip peel only partially , leonidas made certain put their chocolate center stage using generous portion . result addictive treat because flavors linger palate orangettes aren't so sweet become cloying . i don't know if these guys really going improve your health , but they definitely improve your day . my opinion , they're worth money occasional purchase certainly worth one-time try . packaging gold box , wrapped blue white leonidas paper gilt deep purple box . shipping , package placed inside sturdy styrofoam shell . mine arrived within three days looked like i'd purchased them store give gift	1

i received fresh roast plus 8 30th birthday present my parents , which allowed me take my coffee snobbery entirely new level ! this model worked admirably 2+ months i've it , roasting one batch least every two days . it not automatic ( there isn't good roaster ) you need carefuly monitor color , aroma , " cracks " achieve consistent roast , but coffee it produces balanced , consistent , far away better than anything you buy store . negatives it feel mite flimsy : glass roasting chamber sits precariously fan unit could easily knocked off broken . also , it only roasts few ounces time -- perfect if you just want roast enough your morning cup , but don't expect able roast half or entire pounds coffee gifts . smoke pervasive , so it helpful roast beans under your stovetop exhaust fan , lest you set off smoke alarm . overall , this excellent product home roaster who just getting into world coffee roasting . should interest take hold little more , it would wise upgrade larger capacity table-top drum roaster , or used commercial machine	1

i am gluten intolerent , or what ever you want call it . i get asthma wheat flour , so i've spent last 8 years searching perfect flour . i've using this years now , i love this stuff . i use it cookies , cakes , crepes , pancakes , waffles * , madalines , yorkshire pudding , flouring meats crispy frying , thickening soups sauces , etc etc . only thing it hasn't worked bisquits . i think because this flour needs binding agent , such eggs or xantham gum . just butter dough after baking falls apart . flakey yummy , but total mess ! it also tastes kind bitter raw , but once it baked or cooked it exactly same flavor texture wheat flour . you can't go wrong this alternative . go forth confidently experiment all your favorite recipes using this wonderful flour ! i love trying martha stewart cookie recipes , this flour works perfectly all i've tried . * some recipes may require little extra leavening agent ( baking soda or baking powder ) , such waffles , madalines pancakes .	1

nicely seasoned , creamy texture . served over rice , one packet makes generous meal one , or would serve two something side . cooked simply boiling packet pot water until hot -- one relatively few prepared food options where microwave directions actually require more cleanup than stovetop option . makes good option backpacking , too , assuming weight acceptable . requires no refrigeration edible out packet spoon , cold if necessary	1

okay ... this one those foods i never guessed i'd making so often . college student , sure . maybe box once while young married couple . but new mom my motto " my child won't eating ... " . [ actually you could fill number items into space . ] yet , i find myself purveyor many , many meals involve noodles cheese . once awhile these may whole wheat organic noodles , but more often than not it one few foods my stubborn toddler-now preschooler eat : kraft macaroni cheese . pros -- lets face it biggest pro testy tikes eat it . let call it " tasty " then . -- meal quick 9 grams protein per serving . -- it no transfats unless you add them . -- provides 10% adult iron requirements-which translates even higher percentage children . cons -- cost buck per box amazon . -- since wheat flour `processed ' doesn't lot fiber ( 1 gram ) . -- processed flour probably means higher glycemic index ( though should moderated addition oil/butter milk . -- lots sodium ( 740 mg ) . -- lots calories ( 380 prepared per adult serving ) which not necessarily bad if you trying fill up toddler . four stars . my greatest wish would organic , whole wheat flax kraft mac cheese , but until day comes i am happy kraft makes tasty , affordable , meal box children eat . just add veg you ready go	1

" cucumbers 90% liquid ! " they told me , " no liquids any flights now !! " i strip-searched , questioned 6 hours , forced remove all liquid my bladder , held locked room overnight until authorities finally let me go . i come unpleasant realization terrorists winning . we never beat them if we always playing " catch-up " them , enacting new rules after they try something . it seems only way win declare indefinite martial law , place soldiers everywhere , arrest everyone suspicious . unfortunately this tactic didn't help soviets win cold war , besides -- if terrorists " hate us our freedom " aren't we just playing into their hands removing those freedoms ( which we seem doing little time now anyway) ? if we're going play into their hands , why not just cut chase give them what they want now -- defuse whole situation pushing free seperate palestine occupied west bank , remove our troops iraq saudi arabia ( substituing u.n. or nato peacekeeping force iraq ) . then they'd nothing fight anymore . al quaeda might seen heroes first , but would look craven evil most muslims if they continued try blow up infidels across globe , thus completely alienating them peaceful muslim majority . checkmate ! besides , we not " christian nation " most part ? shouldn't we follow christ example " turning other cheek " ? it hard believe simple cucumber could make me rethink all my long-held republican ideals ( mccain ' 08 , baby !! ) , but if i choose eternal war , humbling ( maybe embarassing ) peace , well . . . it no contest . when dirty , smelly hippy flashes " peace " sign me , i smile return favor . god bless america amazing cucumber !	1

i know many people who would love elk carcass their holiday . birthdays , christmas , hanukkah , martin luther king jr. ' birthday observed , grandparent day , etc . all holidays where big piece elk meat could brighten someone day . but watch out !!! i often used amazon order buy gifts , this elk carcass gift wrapping not option . i would think half fun giving huge elk carcass would watching look your loved one face he or she unwrapped slab meat . unfortunately , amazon not think this so . weight product , i think it going difficult wrap this my own . sorry uncle tino , no elk carcass columbus day this year !	1
personally , i didn't like tazo red bush tea very much . i've three different kinds roiboos teas so far this my least favorite . it seems like flavor roiboos itself pretty mild , case tazo tea , flavors they add completely overwhelm it . i found i remove tea bag very quickly lest cup become overwhelmingly lemony acidic . perhaps other pallettes appreciate strength those flavors . personally , i couldn't wait finish off box so i could find better flavor . other roiboos teas i tried milder mix flavors , much better overall effect . my personal choice right now trader joe orange spice roiboos , which apparently bought some , but not all their stores . orange flavor much less up front than lemon citrus flavors tazo tea , overall effect other spices very nice . tea smells lot like other spiced foods ( pumpkin pie comes mind ) very nice gloomy afternoon . also unlike tazo version , flavor this tea gets nicer richer longer you let tea bag steep , although even just pouring water over bag leaving it few seconds usually enough nice cup . admittedly , there lot other roiboos teas i not tried , but this one hit me because its good flavor local availability . keep mind this not opinion tea expert , i never roiboos tea africa so i don't know what it supposed taste like its authentic presentation . just my personal taste	1
this disappointing . someone should define light roast or standardize roasting process .	1

don't get me wrong -- i'm not some nut job who thinks this stuff give you cancer due lack testing . i'm just really miffed fact splenda plenty carbohydrates it -- 24 grams per cup !! they get away this setting their serving size 1 tsp , which 0.5 . would you believe 0.5 product there less than one gram carbohydrate !? no way !! sweetener sucralose not carbohydrate , but since it 600x sweet sugar , they need bulk it up make it measure like sugar . but all maltodextrin they use filler carbohydrates . this could really screw up somebody atkins ' induction phase . example , day before i learned this , i made some kool-aid splenda . i didn't know 2 quarts i drinking down 24 carbs ! what ? find somebody online who sells liquid sucralose . they use water filler , it super-concentrated still , it truly 0 carbs . i look forward day when mcneil nutritionals meets demand zero-carb splenda .

when i got my gummi bears , they kinda stuck together kinda hard . but it still good .	1
first time i encountered haribo gummi bears when i went germany semester overseas . i won bag these classroom prize . first , i thought these going ordinary gummy bears , but , boy i wrong . these candies truly step above all other gummy bears . germany , this brand gummy bears . competitors ' bags sold much lower prices , but few people buy them - that because difference quality taste noticeable . other people reviews regarding sweetness softness accurate . haribo found perfect combination . during rest my stay germany , i became huge consumer haribo candies . haribo sells other gummy candies , but their " gold bears " best . when i returned beautiful america , i disappointed find haribo not so easy acquire . they sold online other stores decent prices but after shipping , cost quite steep . i am truly excited see these bears offered amazon free super-saver shipping . if you never haribo gummi bears , you really need try some . 5-pound bag seems like large quantity , but i promise , you not disappointed	1

i lived japan many years really enjoyed using these " noodles " soups , stir-fry , korean-style cooking , etc . if you looking pasta , these may not exactly match your craving , but nonetheless really versatile ! my advice those who don't like smell upon opening package drain them , sprinkle liberally salt rub through clean hands , then rinse cold water . this how they prepare them japan - it removes any odor they ready use	1
if i could survive pocky pocky alone , i would it . this world perfect snack food . strawberry best them all , though i am partial coconut chocolate flavors too . sweet creamy strawberry-y goodness coats thin crispy cracker stick , making one-of-a-kind taste sensation your mouth . plus one tip uncoated , so you don't even get your hands dirty . if you only try one japanese food , this one . try it , you won't disappointed	1

i actually anxiously waiting try these since reviews mixed but i am soooooo glad i try them bec now i am hooked !!!! yes , they bit expensive when compared pasta but i think it paying some extra bucks remove some pounds off ! i make sure i rinse them really well cold water right before i boil them around 5 minutes which removes all bad smell ! i just add some marinara sauce it deal ! i found texture actually good , like firmer version ramen noodles ! i think these make excellent snack or meal !	1

it ain't spaghetti , folks , but used properly it enhance your eating . it great wet , soupy type dish . eaten " " ( after rinsing ) noodles very soft tender , too soft pass dry italian type pasta , unless you always cook dry pasta death . boiling them minute or two firms them up somewhat , but they never become firm properly cooked dried pasta . reviewer who said pasta out due his/her type 2 diabetes ... it not ! i'm same boat , we still enjoy pasta , we just need measure it control carb servings always use whole grain types slow down sugar load . i weigh out 2 oz . before cooking 2 carb exchanges ( 1/2 cup serving measurement absurd because different types pasta fill cup differently ) , i use bulkier additions like chunky vegetables big salad side . oil vinegar salad dressing helps further temper blood sugar rush . course , if you eat lots carbs breakfast lunch , don't plan 2 carb servings pasta dinner . i given up ( white ) italian bread side ! that worst part , but pasta least do-able .	1

**** tazo chai black tea enjoyable chai experience most part . paper tea packet , tazo writes , " rich blend teas spices style hill dwellers himalayas . " their web site , tazo describes flavor profile chai " cinnamon , creamy , sweet spice " " medium-bodied yet full-flavored , spicy kick cinnamon , ginger , cardamom , black pepper . tazo describes aroma " sweet , spice " . those pretty accurate . black tea " blend " little bitter , though , even minimal brewing . it real trick get it brew long enough get experience flavor spices without tea turn bitter . ingredients chai : black teas , ginger , cinnamon , black pepper , cardamom , cloves , star anise . it caffeinated . tazo interesting company makes only super premium teas . they socially responsible , based portland , motto , " reincarnation tea " . tazo owned starbucks . their web site fun quirky , zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . it unclear , though , their web site , how many their ingredients organic or kosher , they use some " natural flavors " their teas -- this wording seems little vague super premium tea . i would rate this tea , tazo general , good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi . i'm soooooo spoiled numi teas , which why tazo chai gets only four stars . ***	1

***** tazo china green tips green tea slightly stronger green tea than tazo zen , i liked it doesn't contain tazo omnipresent " natural flavors " almost all their other teas contain , which me not advantage . i like natural , real taste real ingredients sans vague " natural flavors " sans flavorings , sans essences , etc . china green tips delivers this cleaner , purer way than tazo other teas . i liked this green tea ! ingredients china green tips simply spring-harvested green teas china . it contains caffeine . tazo interesting company makes only super premium teas . they socially responsible , based portland , motto , " reincarnation tea " . tazo owned starbucks . their web site fun quirky , zen-type focus , definitely worth checking out . it unclear , though , their web site , how many their ingredients organic or kosher , they use some " natural flavors " their teas -- this wording seems little vague unnecessary super premium tea . china green tips none these " natural flavors " it shows quality cleanliness tea experience . paper tea packet , tazo writes , " traditional chinese green tea delicate fresh taste light green liquor . " this perfect way describe this tea ! their web site , tazo describes flavor profile china green tips " grassy , vegetative , sweet , ricey " . tazo describes aroma " vegetative , popcorn " . i would rate this tea , tazo general , very good --- better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings --- but not good numi or aspen . still , this tea excellent , so i'm breaking my tradition tazo teas giving it five stars . if you enjoy super premium teas , stuck tazo some reason , choose china green tips you quite satisfied . i can't honestly say any other tazo tea . ****	1
hands down , best steaks i ever . i scoff people who would refer them dry : they simply don't know how cook steak . we buying omaha steaks products 4 years . no , i am not butcher , but i enjoy good steak . terms value : $6-$8 steak would scare me if i saw it menu restaurant -- these steaks value . there no supermarkets my area compete these cuts beef . these days there not lot products or companies out there who deliver consistent quality , but omaha steaks one company who continues impress me .	1
i've said it before , i'll say it again - i'm white gal who likes throw her ample weight around ! i find these cupcakes second only mighty ding dong when it comes hostess treats . chocolate cake great , frosting absolutely delectable . avoid bastardization golden hostess cupcake	1

how you not love twinkie ? it compact , delicious , aerodynamic . if you actually look ingredients , twinkies made flour , water , shortening , eggs , sugar ... sound familiar ? it cake . there some preservatives added increase shelf life , but they make up very small percentage overall treat . air we breathe probably contains more dangerous ' additives ' than twinkie . let us face facts ; if one eat slice after slice chocolate cake baked using organic ingredients , person going end up coronary bypass land just quickly if one gorged twinkies . twinkies , like anything , moderation just fine	1
these coffee pods delicious . i , my co-worker doctor whom i share these so they could experience them also loved this cinnamon swirl flavored coffee . deliver super fast . great transaction	1

i bought seven beans seven dollars , bit unimpressed aromatic quality . they didn't strong complex aroma right out bag bourbon beans known . not say inside bean isn't aromatic . after all , it guts really count . even though these beans don't seem aromatic other beans , this still killer deal !!! i recently purchased one bean popular brand " spice islands " seven dollars . unbelievably aromatic bean , but seven times cost these beans !?!?!? i think i'll just buy these use twice many higher quality beans . i'm still making away like bandit	1
i bought these greatest thing besides awesome price fabulous beans vp or ceo or some such lovely gentleman actually emailed me thanked me my purchase when i responded , followed up again nice response ! how nice this day age ! i used these beans my home made eggnog this year it out this world . i first scraped bean then threw pod left it there till nog gone . ( not long)i also use one when i make my hot chocolate " syrup " ( lots bittersweet chips , melted milk little haff half bean scraped pod - once again left - i mske hot chocolate out it adding more milk taste little bitty bit brandy ... decadent ... oh my yes ! )this great buy , great beans , great company ! buy assurance !	1

i love this tea . filterbag smelled unbelievable , beverage itself brewed up into this gorgeous dark pink color . i wish i'd used my clear glass mug . i added little sugar because i can't drink anything without little sweetener , but your average person probably would fine it . this stuff terrific , i definitely recommend it	1
blend little apple cider mix into your tazo passion tea see what happens . this creates magical apple cider experience hints cranberry hibiscus flowers gathered ancient land . snuggle up spiced cider good choice because you then spoon exact amount you desire , but packets cider work equally well . this type tea you would expect enjoy after skiing some distant forest where you also munching homemade brownies or eggnog cookies . apple cider also works very well gypsy teas , especially lemon jasmine . deep purple/red color hibiscus fragrance tazo tea enough make anyone passionate tea . yet , this really tea ? it looks like tea , but it really herbal infusion made steeping hibiscus flowers , orange peel , licorice , cinnamon , rose hips , lemongrass red poppy swirling hot water . original flavor also slightly reminiscent hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which why it extra delicious cider mix . tazo teas mysterious experience into which you lose yourself sense abandon . so far i've tried more flavors than i count always impressed . ~ rebecca review	1
i received very well packaged ( promptly shipped even ) package habanero jerky mahogany smoked meats . jerky itself it obviously made good meat ( vs some garbage you'd get oberto or whomever ) . initial smell excellent . aroma pepper brown sugar . however , jerky itself somewhat sticky . pieces jerky itself stuck together , so extracting single piece consumption becomes chore . after you're , your hands all sticky . my guess if they manufacturer spent little longer dessicator , we'd drier product tasted just well . how spicy . well , my lips burning . i like . i really love habanero ( fact grow several varieties home ) . this isn't some quot ; slightly spicyquot ; product name habanero it make it seem macho . it scorch your mouth . my opinion , scorch good way . price great . you'd spend much any store , buying far lower quality jerky , just try finding habanero anything safeway . kudos amazon removing yet one more thing my shopping list . additional kudos mahogany smoked meats such wonderful product . i've taken one star off jerky so sticky ( i guess it sugar ? ) , difficulty separating out pieces jerky themselves . definitely recommended	1

unless you wealthy chocoholic , you would probably never blow 50$ these . gift however , this great box ( there similar all heart shaped box valentines - which cool if you dig hearts ) . it fits all qualities i look gift . its extravagant , its something person i give it love , its something they wouldn't get themselves . i tried 2 these , mixed berry ridiculously good . peanut butter jelly interesting . everything superb quality wise . i knock it down bit price , but honestly , its tough find fault this product . it much much better than regular godiva ( which i find super sweet overpriced )	1
i am huge fan tasty bite products , delighted find amazon now stocks them , since they expensive my small town ( no trader joe here ! ) . i excited see this variety i never tried before , readily ordered six pack these noodles peanut sauce , expecting same ready-to-eat food other tasty bites i tried offer . but unlike their ready-to-eat rice dishes which rice packet merely need heating but already fully cooked , noodles here their raw state need boiled ten minutes , so you can't grab this bring it work way you most other tasty bite meals . also , peanut sauce delectable complex flavor , but spiced textured so i felt it really needed some vegetables or meat round it out . i love spicy dishes , but this meal seemed planned overly spiced so when you add veggies meat , it would perfect . so , quick meal starter home or way helping use up leftover meat veggies , this gets five stars . it delicious . some additions i enjoyed chicken , steak , bell pepper , cauliflower , carrots , eggplant , sweet potato . but i am giving this meal four stars overall because my expectation eating other tasty bite entrees this grab go meal i could pop microwave prepared couple minutes .	1

red bull used my favorite drink , i would not go 24 hours without drinking entire . era ended simply because i beginning get sick paying over $2.00 one . i know several distributors who offer product $1.50 , but i seldomly stock up stuff end up paying $2.00 plus 8% tax , which comes out $2.15 . which fine me until you realize you spending over 700 dollars year this rate . it never stopped me before i always felt it worth it , considering drink helps me focus college each morning . however , i recently noticed days when i not school i drank red bull , rather than full energy ready jog , i would become tired . i began wonder why i would get tired after drinking red bull . maybe my inner body saying , " stop drinking this **** every freaking day your life ! " whatever case , i decided stop buying it daily basis just drink it when i wake up very early . hopefully this make it become effective my body again , because i think i may overdone it , considering i probably consumed well over 1000 cans my life . i personally enjoy drinking cold red bull . set aside energy factor . while many people ( actually everyone i know ) says it sick makes them gag , i kinda like cough droppy taste offered red bull . i find red bull conversation starter myself - kinda like smoker talk . i love sip my red bull discuss weather or some other exciting news my peers . while i tried so many other energy drinks , i say i hate all them . there never energy drink i enjoyed other than red bull . i guess i just like austrian people so much ( fact red bull vegan ! ) other hand , it full man-made chemicals might some weird things me future - only time tell	1

i give up coffee completely last year turned tea , instead . i've tried 70+ varieties tea past year . some many brands i've tried include tazo , stash , adagio , republic tea , twinings , harrogate , market spice . tea sampling become fun little hobby me . after reading tea gourmand review stating she tried numerous high-end bagged teas -- barry , yorkshire gold , pg tips , like -- only find she kept coming back tazo awake , i decided give " awake " try . i fell love first sip . i 3 large mahoghany tea chests filled various tea bags , but this tea i drink everyday . i enjoy cup " awake " each morning , dab milk . it my new religion . this tea not everyone . my husband acted disdainful toward " awake " when he tasted it , saying it kinda reminded him everyday liptons tea . ( interestingly , i later read survey saying bunch blind-folded gourmands tasted something like 20 cups various teas , only unaminously choose -- lipton's!!! magazine said all taste-testers shocked when they learned they choose liptons over gourmet tea blends ! hahaha)i don't know why i find this tea so addictive . perhaps it strong , rich flavor appeals coffee drinker me ? regardless reason , i highly recommend you give this tea try if you like assertively-flavored teas .	1
