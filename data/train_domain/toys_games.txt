yum ... play food ! this great set . i buy it soon i find it . this great set ! lots cans ( good storage ) , ice cream , boxed treats , cookies , ( yummy ) , course , much more . who could resist spaghetti meatballs ? chocolate chips ice cream ? oh my gosh , it better than i thought . you might think good time , your child needs 40 dollar melissa doug wooden play food real cutting noises fisher price 100 dollar kitchen imaginative play . bullpies , i say . i tons dollar-store food . i ultra-realistic foam food kitchen set i got . i prefer dollar store food . dollar store food better because it more one package , looks real , cheap , pretty durable , looks nice . i really silly play food set came stovetop ( small , but knobs turn ! ) , pink purple propane tank , " barracuda " ( seriously ) , " barracuda hash " which included barracuda , ham eggs , chicken , turkey , potpie , more eggs . but logo spam hotdog , front it beans , turkey , fish , sausage , lots weird meat . but it says " eatable , 100% dainty , present !, daintiness , dainty " . just wanted let you know . so , bottom line , dollar store play food much better than you think it . it comes lots things expensive companies would never dreamed	1

i bought this my daughter her 11th birthday . after playing game once , she asked me if i could take it back . she said game boring because it so limited far what you could game . my daughter always played lot " simulated life " video games ( i.e. , sims , animal crossing ) online games ( i.e , club penguin ) . i suspect this why she found this game limiting . other games she played portray more intricate " life " therefore draw player greater degree . my advice would consider what your daughter used before buying this . if your daughter no experience these types games , this game probably fine . however if your daughter previously played simulated life games , she probably find this one lacking .	1

fine print box tells you this " multi-terrain " vehicle , instead " all terrain " vehicle , this because while they advertise it go through sand , grass , mud , what they actually mean it go through dry sand , such you would find desert , dry grass , such you would find african savannah , dry mud , such you would find their fertile imagination . mine shorted out stopped working just going through dewey grass .	1

this appealed me since i would able use it longer than standard mobile , but it ended up not working when we wanted it anyways . i liked idea , but just doesn't work . this mobile constantly stops working ( before 8 minutes up ) ... it stops going round . music continues lights still , but base stops rotating , it seems though it always gets " stuck " we push it get " unstuck " . we've changed battery doesn't seem help base keeps getting stuck , i contacted mattel get voucher since it more than 90 days since i bought this , can't return it store .

i bought this table my almost 8 month old who starting pull up things . i thought this would safe her learn stand because it hand grippers sides table ( just purpose ) recommended ages 6 months+ . all fun shapes , colors , sounds immediately caught her attention . she cawled over it when she tried pull herself up it fell over ontop her . she bumped her head cried , but fortunately , wasn't hurt . i put rug under it thinking maybe would help make it more stable , but soon she tried pull up again ( within 5 minutes taking it out box ) it fell over her again . top table very heavy , but legs not very sturdy , making it topheavy easy topple . needless say , i took it back store . i would not recommend this toy unless you only wanted take legs off use it floor , or if you toddler who very steady standing his own . personally , i think recommended age should changed older children or this toy should recalled legs redesigned .	-1

" video game " which you assume move quickly , you'd better set aside lease hour play it . you exhausted when you're through . we suggest they go back drawing board stop all pauses , play some theme music when you choosing your case , show girl who opens your case , audience clap - anything !!!!!!!! if you buy this game , you only yourself blame . p.s. i won $ 750,000 didn't even care , i just glad it over	-1

this very mediocre knights kingdom set . there not much interest going here , small castle suffers lazy design . colorful knights morcia back , once again fighting against vladek , black knight . two good knights make appearance here ( blue purple ) , we also get vladek , dark soldier , skeleton . minifigs charismatic ever , each sporting his own unique expression . vladek his henchman cute " i'm evil " lego frown . our knights outfitted usual accessories . swords shields , black hatchet henchman . scene small mountainside castle home large scorpion monster . creature constructed mixture regular technic parts , he hinged pieces articulated tail pincers . blue knight accompanied his horse , who cute mini-catapult strapped his side . scorpion fit into his den base castle , which front gate raised lowered . high atop tower mini-catapult thin boom crane small barred jail cell dangling precariously it . rest castle just walls , floors , staircase . this castle very fragile . mine fell apart several times while i working building it . whole , design just isn't all great . handle care , play care . colors mostly black , dark gray , dark red , brown . this set one those nice walls barred window , some signature knights kingdom battlement pieces . this set works addition vladek dark fortress . its own , it stunningly less impressive . good news savvy lego maniac take castle parts build better castle them . my verdict : one thumb up scorpion monster ( who added your other knights kingdom adventures ) , one thumb down rest . could've better . my advice get vladek dark fortress . it more than worth price admission . those still hungering more knights kingdom action after vladek fortress built conquered , this set better than nothing	-1

we got this when our son 4 months old first he love it . there slight rubber\plastic smell everything tub time tub but we thought it would fade time . well six months later smell still there our son ended up stop playing most bath toys except squirting bath buddies . we all precautionary steps keep bath toys clean yet they grew mold very short amount time . playtime tub toys good except teething sailing boats which also rubber smell . plus stacking tubs not make practical storage because lids too flimsy . there some good points this product but i feel it not worth $35 price tag . guess that why it clearance store . it combination quality price made me give it only 2 stars .	1

although this new release barbie looks very much like real life singer , doll itself not something i would recommend child under 12 . doll dressed pretty sccantilly adorned realistic jewlerly . it also comes bracelet appropriate teen . short hair this doll tight clothing not lend itself childs play more suited serious doll collector or mcbride fan	1
i bought leappad plus writing impulse store , wanting help my son writing , phonics , etc . he used it few times , but i almost beg him use it ... that sad . i wish i would gotten original leappad or perhaps even leapster . one thing , book doesn't recognize all pencil movements . child could make incorrect number or letter , it doesn't seem leappad would recognize it . also , child keep erasing over over , providing limited usage . not only , there only few books published leappad writing mind , exercises repetitive ( e.g. writing number 6 ten times ) . i've bought quite few leappad books quantum pad books my son , he just not interested after initial use . i'm sure he learned little bit phonics using phonics books such , but i think he learns more workbooks bought bookstore or department store -- they're cheaper ! not only leappad books very short ... much shorter than workbooks you buy . considering leappad books usually around $15 pop -- amazon doesn't carry/list them all there very limited selection stuff mar t-t ype stores ( least , that case my geographical area) -- you may want re-consider investing leappad system .	1

i gave this my fiance christmas , who loves sudoku video games , so i thought it would brilliant combination . he excited , but frustrated how not easy it play . he can't always tell where cursor board , so if he sets it down minute , he can't see where he left off . then when he playing semi-dark while we train , he couldn't see anything either ( backlight would nice feature ) . it just seems this model not designed very intuitively : he keeps wanting press clear change number , but it clears game . all say , 2 million puzzles sounds great ... unless it too frustrating play	1

this car pictured could base or first version defintely not worth 299.00 these going 100.00 less web . if you havent noticed differences packaging it wouldnt suprise me . lots people dont notice . heres differences below ... these 5 cars there two versions each driver(5 different drivers ) made . first versions or base version second versions or " added features " version . first versions no " added features " stickers you cannot race any two ( or more ) cars 5 different drivers ' cars same time ! dale sr. dale jr. , jeff gordon , jimmie johnson tony stewart cars first versions ( no added features ) cannot race together ! transmitter frequencys cannot changed . speed steering straight function . ( no varilable anything ) they either turn right full turn or left full turn or it goes straight . speed either it goes full or it doesnt . same reverse gear . again , each 5 different drivers ' cars made two different versions same car one more features than other . updated or " added features " versions " added features " stickers . those " added features " ... digital proportional steering ( variable steering ) , which means you turn transmitter wheel slightly car turns little . turn transmitter wheel alot car turns alot . variable speed control this means you pull back trigger little car moves little , pull back trigger all way car takes off ! this also works reverse gears well now if this isnt cool enough ... each " added features " car different frequencies different drivers ' car . transmitters cars different well . " added features " version transmitter two " trim " adjustments back remote well frequency chip side remote than changed , also changed chassis car . so if you own 2 tony stewart cars , you would frequency pack race them same time . now , two or more different drivers ' cars race together ( or five people race 5 different cars ) . no two alike cars race together unless you " frequency car transmitter " change it , or " frequency pack " team up inc . all 5 frequency chips not come car box , off shelf . this " frequency pack " sold seperately ! you also purchase tires , suspension parts body hold down clips , fully painted ready use new spare or other drivers ' teams bodies , extra rechargeable battery packs seperately ! i lots research these cars should you any questions please ask...nascarnbroncosfans@msn.co	1

i bought these my 13-year old niece , who loves percussion , so excited get them christmas . they looked like great buy . well , disappointment palpable two hours later . we got them hooked up , installed appropriate batteries etc ., light , but we could not get any sound drumsticks all . which bummer , but ok , if we could simply either ( 1 ) get help or ( 2 ) easily replace them . nope . " instructions " tiny folded sheet paper , there absolutely no troubleshooting , no help , no nothing . i went through everything came them but could find anything help us next steps or returns , etc . i finally retrieved original plastic packaging found url tiny letters company . but when i went there , site again offered no help , tips , or troubleshooting ( just pdf really awful original instructions ) . there video website showing someone playing drumsticks but this no help us trying troubleshoot ( except mildly disappoint my niece when she realized you drum " air " get best results -- which we try , no luck or sound , again ) . i next e-mailed company got no response . i e-mailed them again -- seven days later -- e-mail ( badly worded english ) simply asked me if we tried " plugging head phones . " seriously . anyway , not waste your money . terrible product , no support , no recourse if it doesn't work it should	-1

if you run spellcaster deck , buy good cards individually because my opinion , i rarely get good cards out this booster	1
our daughter became this she baby . we tried several time during her past 2 years if she would reach moment like it , but she always wanted go out after 1 or 2 minutes . maybe other babies diferent , but i think its not right material such playground . hot environment like ours south , it quickly gets very hot inside you not leave your baby or little child alone playing because plastic material dangerous . we finally sealed holes bottom not pump up upper part so we fill it water use it litle pool , thats only way us use it	1
ok , maybe that bit strong , but this hands down our most hated toy ( adults , kids plenty frustrated , too ) . we received it gift ( wow whoever would pay $35 this crazy . ) . our son nearly five needs help load truck , which loaded fully work without jamming ; time-consuming procedure , since dominoes loaded one-at-a-time . dominoes themselves also almost too lightweight stand well end , prone easy collapse . after initial newness wears off this toy going disappear , that something i've never even contemplated before	-1

hideaway bought my daughter who loves it . easily assembled , up within 60 seconds . i noticed there two loops attached hideaway , presumably tie some rope them then stake ground . there no rope or stakes purchase , i am unaware if these should included . two entrances into hideaway , front inverted entrance great . however , rear porthole type entrance , not good children when playing games they trip material bottom . material not durable , but care there should no issues . lot bigger than it looks site , which nice surprise .	1
i bought this game fly cause cover illustration looked so interesting i couldn't resist . instructions little confusing understand first , but once gameplay started it picked up pretty easy much fun enjoyed everyone . game geared those ages 10 up , but it so easy understand so much fun , my 8 year old neice able play without teaming up adult . game promotes math skills which huge plus since many games today only fun . this game it all , fun , education artwork cards fantastic . when we played , we threw chocolate gold pieces so we'd real pirate plunder everyone speak like pirate . it really great way spend quality time your family it fun all ages	1
i so excited get time tracker am now so frustrated it . first one i got not work all ... they sent second one this one worked less than 5 minutes ( we tried 3 different sets new batteries ) . it such great concept , but unfortunately very poorly made . i also surprised how cheap looking whole thing real life .	-1

if one good thing said dread pirate , it physical game components reek quality . cloth game board , glass jewels , metal coins , wooden dice pewter game pieces all come together give overall sense realism game . it pity , however , game itself isn't nearly exciting pieces . dread pirate relies entirely random dice rolls determine every single outcome game . move place place , you roll dice . challenge player " skirmish " ( which how you steal their treasure ) , you roll dice . steal jewels enemy port , you roll dice . trade jewels port , you roll dice . there absolutely no semblance any real strategy this game . you win accumulating most treasure , amount treasure you accumulate depends entirely how lucky you your roll dice . this game not fun , even frustrating , especially young child who keeps rolling low numbers . there some thinking involved ... you need judge yourself who you should attack when , but even if you make best possible strategic decision , you still lose die roll end up empty-handed . i would recommend dread pirate only if your family specifically looking game where you don't think , only if your children mature enough deal bad luck ( good/bad luck only way win/lose this game ) . if you're looking enjoyable family game everyone play , i would very much reccommend cranium over this . it less expensive , there alot more it , it your family getting up , active , laughing out loud ( instead sitting around rolling dice determine number jewels you take )	-1

" it doesn't let child know they getting close it until they see it . my daughter gave up it quickly because she would wandering house aimlessly without any clue it where abouts . i not recommend this toy any one . i would given it no stars , but she like bear itself . yourself favor ... buy care bear ( much cheaper ) , hide it somewhere , you truthfully tell your child when they " getting warmer !	-1

we bought this gadget our 2-year old . risk sounding like broken record -- or faulty spinning plastic toy , this case--i'll just add my vote design flaws : 1 . volume . not only volume loud , it unbearably so . even my daughter grabs her ears when she playing it . voice bit garbled well , so when command ' ready .. spin!' sounds more like ' wordy ... spew!' i prefer spare my daughter hearing loss live concerts her teenage years , so i've disabled on/off switch . 2 . spin quality . sit ' spin should fluid , effortless motion ( like lazy susan ) . this toy requires enormous effort turn . add my daughter frustation , handle base gives bit ( even screws tightly fastened ) , making tedious experience rather than joy ride we loved kids . spare expense frustration fitting this thing garbage collection day -- buy easel finger paint kit instead .	-1
i though this shark would bigger . i bought same one gift shop ri 99 cents 2 years ago	1
friend mine zombies !!!, also twilight creations . i've played it few times , found it pretty enjoyable . zombietown sort followup this some ways , tries expand strategy game somewhat . unfortunately , it ends up far too confusing complicated make fast gameplay ( it often very slow , fact ) , strategy more shallow than risk . ya know stereotypically confusing instructions insert tab into slot ? that pretty much what instructions this read like . they're fairly poorly written boot . there also couple problems we ran into rules didn't seem cover . i can't recall them off top my head , they didn't come up very often , but it still irritating . overall , definetly not reccomended . $40 stores , $35 off amazon , it also huge ripoff . what you get box ? like 100 tiny army men-esque figures , couple packs cards , laminated piece cardboard . i understand why it expensive , i'm sure this low budget item such , but zombies !!! much less expensive .	1

this pretty much kid vs kid only . adults cannot play . you make it into solo game one child , but its really more like flash cards spelling if you . product basically set flash cards spelling , some letter cubes kids spell out words . rules propose two games , which basically see if kids spells word right , they get keep card if they , first kid 5 cards wins . adults pretend play if child younger " fall it . " it really works game only if there two kids same age playing . i don't know , but i can't see my daughter pulling this out when friend comes over . therefore , extent this set flash cards spelling , its kind expensive what it . don't get me wrong , you definitely make it into learning tool . your call .	1

my son loves color wonder line crayola , so when i saw they came out new creation called color explosion , which marker-type product , i knew i try it . now , i wish i'd saved my money . first off , you should know this product not preschoolers . color explosion recommended children 6-years up . now i've played it , i concur . i came upon this product when arrangements made watch my 9 10-year old nieces week . i thought color explosion would hit , i planned treat them this " art " related project throughout week . they excited try it , once i settled monkey boy , my 5-year old , project his own , we got started . first glance , it looked winner . girls fun . then , we started page , markers became icky . gummy probably better description . markers covered black film , which caused images look splotchy , streaky . crayola suggests you wipe markers off paper towel , so we . it kept happening . instance , we'd draw short line , then we'd wipe film off again . then , we tried wipe off images paper towel . didn't help either . color explosion too painstaking child activity . we began realize it wasn't blast , but bummer . crayola warns against moisture , but even fingerprints spear pages , film comes off onto your hands , table , everything else . oh , if you use glitter set , it clumps , mixes film , makes liquidy black goo stains fabrics . company warns staining , suggests washing immediately , but come . they even test market this product ? what i thought would entertaining venture , turned out messy disappointment .	-1

it christmas day , believe me , only thing would get me sit down computer level dissatisfaction i've thomas battery powered engines . these trains derail constantly . i think it because all four wheels power , front wheels too much traction , so they able climb out grooves . took me all night set up really cool track , they derail every 40 seconds or so . read : 3 year old yelling train . thank goodness i also bought brio battery powered engine well ( polar express one ) . it works much better . it not derailed once all morning . it also better following ways : 1 ) it shuts off after 2 minutes so you don't lose battery power , 2 ) it go into freewheel mode when you want use it without power , 3 ) it goes reverse , 4 ) it makes train sounds , 5 ) coupling other cars swivel which means it less likely derail more likely maintain magnetic connection , 6 ) it comes batteries installed . if " santa claus " not disposed all packaging last night , i would return all battery operated thomas trains go brio ones . note : there good thomas battery powered car which jet engine . this jet engine swivel , seems not derail , maybe because it pushes other cars front it	-1

i am breast cancer survivor i find this pink dressed , blond " doll " perfection rather insulting my female self , perfect perky boobs , long blond hair , body not exist woman after ravages chemotheraphy . i perfectly understand mattel wanting support breast cancer research donate portion proceedes towards funding ( thank you your generosity ) , but it under guise selling " doll " which not reflect community women who experienced challenges recovery survivorship ... doll which not look like survivor literally painful insulting ! why doesn't this doll wig ? why doesn't she breast removed ? why doesn't she bra fitted form mimic shape breast ? what wrong reality ? why can't mattel acknowledge true nature this disease make doll which comforts , not insults sensibility women who suffered this disease . i purchase this doll , just because i am horrified product itself . i disrobe her , saw , cut off her breast so she look more like me , survivor , woman pride . i dismantle construct supposed beauty make this image more like my own - because i am what woman , not facade false construction .	-1

if it up my children , they would rate this stuff 5+ stars . they love it they totally entertained it . it one only times they play quietly without fighting . mom , other hand , hates it you know it bad when toy gives mom some free time peace quiet she wants no part it !!! this stuff sticks everything anything-including your children . you can't believe mess it makes . imagine billions tiny little balls stuck everything your house . i confine it their playroom , but it follows them everywhere they go . you find it all over your house everything-you can't escape it . product itself , it definitely doesn't dry out , but it also doesn't hold together well described making it quite difficult make objects it claims you make package . once you put colors together it impossible separate them out they tiny millimeter balls . playdooh may dry out if left out , but it doesn't make anywhere near mess this stuff it also molds much better than playfoam ! my advice stick your playdooh	-1
when this toy turned it seriously sounds like air-raid siren going off . i can't use my usual trick putting tape over speaker because you need able hear instructions play games . also , counting/shape game confusing . there row shapes numbers them , game asks child , example , find 3 rectangles . it trying get child press rectangle shape three times , but rectangle shape marked number 8 . there circle marked number 3 . only reason i'm not giving this one star because my son enjoys playing " repeat tone " " count villians " games . i'm not sure how much longer adults house handle siren noise , though , i may try hide this get him leapfrog toy instead	1

i can't put it any better than others before me . i lot research before purchasing this train am so glad i decided spend little bit more money ton more quality . this truly heirloom train set around longer than i ( i'm only 35 ) . other reviewers also correct advising you shop around before purchasing this train set . prices vary wildly . yes , it hurts little spend this kind money train set when you know there others out there . however , others cheaper reason ... they're junk . you simply can't better than this set	1
my 2 year old 4 year old love this playdoh set . i recommend it highly	1
this game so much fun !!! i think maybe it could use few more games or maybe make different difficulty levels . other words ... if you huge star wars fan like me , then you love this game !!! it keep you occupied least hour day if you determined beat certain level . thing i think it could use maybe game-save function or something ... anyway , great gaming experience !!! one half thumbs up !!!	1
someone gave these us when my son 9 months old . he loved holding them it fun watching him learn " color " develop his hand-eye coordination . he now 22 months old we've just used them up i buy crayola tub crayons because i couldn't find these toys us . crayola crayons thinner ( which doesn't hold up well toddler abuse ) more colors , but i like these better because they come ducky sponge wash crayon off walls ( my son loves part , too ) . these crayons surefire way get my son into bathtub	1
my 2 year old daughter ( our 4 6 year old neighbors ) love this toy ! i it up during my daughter second birthday party all kids loved it ! it holds up very well i only refill it once ( only because one kids managed pull out plug ) . some balls not 100% inflated but they still roll just fine my daughter best time this . it up living room not outside so keeps it getting any other holes . i would recommend this any kids around 4 or under . one thing keep mind ; kids may afraid it first ; my daughter terrified it first day but second she loved it now she spends lot time there	1

my 6-year-old got this christmas he his 4-year-old brother love it ! they enjoy doing battles coming up different monster combinations . it teaches strategy since they figure out which combinations work best . my kids also like just play figures themselves like action figures . piece advice though : this game only comes 2 figures so you really must buy additional figures or it won't much fun since point create varying combinations . therein lies problem - or least my problem ! i can't find extra figures this thing ! luckily , they available around christmas so i got some then , but now i can't find them stock anywhere . also , i not any durability problems although i some sound quality problems 2nd day . fortunately , it turned out all i needed new batteries . you really need alkalines this game . overall , it what my boys think though they adore this !!!	1

ok , this toy not deserve 5 stars but other reviews far too harsh . first 30 minutes my chihuahua terrified this thing worth price . stuffed animal it very cute but not too cuddly because it hard plastic under fur . i love scrat movie sounds this thing makes quite funny first but get boring soon unless you family pet terrorize like i . here trick . put scrat pillow your hadn behind him so you make him move wiggle his tail without seen , then someone bring family pet . when i lunged dog feet he screamed run through meet grinder . this may sound cruel but i assure you dog not hurt now enjoys showing scrat who boss whenever we turn him	1
my three girls ages 3 7 liked this toy when added their pretend food collection . we didn't use it game . you place different frosting sprinkle combination pieces onto different colors donuts make different varieties . each would take turn ' ordering ' types donuts others would ' make ' them . yes , frosting won't stay if donut turns over but fits easily works great plate pretend play ! box flimsy but we just keep all pieces our general play food bin so not issue . would buy this again . great kids imaginations	1

this great doll -- we gave it our 2-year-old daughter last week she now carries her everywhere , feeds her , reads her , puts her bed , covers her blanket , obsessively pats her back tush . she quite cuddly soft ; you'll want hold her yourself . you might expect pictures arms legs would hard plastic like head , but fact they very soft pliable , trunk body all cloth , like pillow , bean-bag tushie . headband removable but actually stays there pretty well . eyes don't those stupid eyelids you usually see baby dolls , ones open shut when you lift doll , always seem stop working properly after couple weeks . we'll see how " maria " holds up kind punishment our daughter mete out , but she seems pretty durable . what great purchase !	1

all peek blocks fun . although each set different ' theme ' they very similar enjoyable play . these blocks great fun . each block something interesting inside it . our house these played boys pretty roughly times . windows see inside still clear not one these blocks broken . so i would say they sturdy hold up well normal play . ends each block texture . within each block something interesting . many blocks activity associated it- push button make noise , twist knob make something turn around etc . one thing i would warn these blocks not stack well , particularly tall towers . so if you thinking buying these tower building , i'd consider different set blocks . otherwise , these excellent toys . they provide basis communication vocubulary building your child . they sturdy encourage language , eye hand coordination so . if you enjoy toys fairly quiet , more than push button make noise , foster independent creative play exploration world this excellent toy . enjoy .	1

my daughter 12 dancing princess party she loved game . it little tricky her set up , but she enjoys playing it	1
my children loved this toy all ( 1 ) hour . my only complaint material . you probably guess this punctured almost immediately . i made sure clear debris beforehand it seems something very small wounded this toy . i've refilled it but i'm little apprehensive where let my kids use this . it seems it takes very little disable this toy .	1
we've one house few years now . kids ( 5 2-1/2 ) love it . it soft , cuddly , sized just right them . it taken all over place , provided companionship them many long trip ( including two south korea ) , given comfort when they sad , used countless hours make-believe . its worth far more than what paid it	1
this one few toys , it seems , which remained fundamentally unchanged since we children . push-stick shaped little differently ( i remember thin blue broom stick orange or red handle ) but otherwise , it same . no electronic sounds or flashing lights added - although you get it way , too , if you want . personally i think these things detract imagination building aspects certain toys . i'm not saying we no talking or musical or flashing toys , but it dismays me when these things added classics ( think little people farm etc ) . what i love this toy it anything . it sweeper ! it carpet cleaner ! it mop ! it never fails crack me up when my son comes running after me his corn popper when i am cleaning . it lawnmower ! so many jobs around house or yard copied corn popper . if mom or dad isn't up much , it still great fun run around which means exercise kiddies . it solo toy playing-with-other-kids toy . any time we other children over play , corn popper comes out they chase each other house . we got this toy when my son 13 months . he now 3y4m still playing this toy . i seen 5 6 year olds still playing corn popper . there few toys so simple yet offer so much fun . sturdy , too - very important it bound crashed into few walls . i can't think toy which give you more bang your buck - unless you count dirt measuring spoons all those other free things kids so exasperatingly pick over toys you paid good money . i am little alarmed current price listed this toy , though . you should not need pay much it . occasionally this item becomes hard find - especially christmas - but usually there tons them stores around cost president hamilton . right now this listed twice .	1

star wars trivial pursuit saga edition ( 2005 . ) introduction :d espite around since middle seventies , star wars series never declined its popularity . george lucas created science fiction phenomenon stood test time , then some . needless say , many games based series - video games , role-playing games , no shortage board games adapted star wars universe . 1998 , star wars trivial pursuit released . die-hard fan series , it far my favorite ( non video game ) star wars game ever . unfortunately , it outdated fast , due fact it didn't cover prequel trilogy it immediately followed . but 2005 , seven years three star wars episodes later , new version game hit store shelves ! read my review new version star wars trivial pursuit . overview : quite honestly , who doesn't know what trivial pursuit ? well , those you who living under rock all your life , here concept behind game . players alternate rolling die moving their game token across wheel-shaped board . there six different-colored spaces . each color represents different category . player then asked question category . if he or she gets it right , he or she goes again . if he or she misses it , it next player turn . six spots board wedge spaces . objective game gain wedge all six colors return central hub wheel , answer game-winning question . some changes this edition game , rather obviously , questions overall game design star wars based , two dvds , which contain wedge game-winning questions . new concept game includes player able " steal " if player unable answer wedge question , last few seconds time . essentially , game play stays play classic stylings trivial pursuit , but gives it star wars overhaul . other words , this game exactly what it says it . review : original star wars trivial pursuit , without question , my favorite star wars game all time wasn't video game . this new version massive improvement over old version . starters , new version covers entire star wars film saga . classic galactic civil war trilogy ( episodes iv , vi ) prequel clone wars trilogy ( episodes i , ii , iii ) all get equal emphasis . if you hated original version not covering prequel trilogy , problem , obviously , corrected , major way . dvds also add nice new twist game . it good finally method setting wedge questions apart regular questions . , course , you anywhere two four players or teams . i few minor complaints , though . first all selection tokens characters you play . original version luke skywalker , princess leia , han solo , darth vader . other words , nice assortment main characters . new version luke skywalker , darth vader , obi-wan kenobi , yoda . other words , only jedi characters . this strictly cosmetic flaw , but still , i think they could picked better assortment characters than those four . complaint inclusion die . those you who never played original version game , it included electronic r2d2 figurine which would tell you how many spaces move when you tapped its head , via lcd screen . i liked better than rolling die because it helped give game unique star wars feel playing die just doesn't . problem price game - i've seen it everywhere $45 $60 ! even lowest msrp , it still rip off . one biggest problems one most obvious - if you're not die-hard star wars fan , you not get very far this game . my last biggest complaint questions themselves - like original game , they horribly imbalanced . some questions so simple , casual fan could answer them easily . some so difficult , even die-hards trouble them . this brings me my complaint dvd questions . not only these questions really no more difficult than card questions , but time ticks down , questions become easier ! this makes it ridiculously easy player " steal " wedge if question receiver unable answer . if i designing game , i'd straighten up these flaws . but i'm not , overall , i am very satisfied it . edition notes : this game fairly recent release , it remains readily available most major stores sell board-style games movie merchandise . if you want game , it shouldn't too hard - just ready pay fairly high price it . overall :d espite some minor issues , this new version star wars trivial pursuit leaps-and-bounds improvement over original game . if you're huge fan series who thinks your knowledge series supreme , don't hesitate buy this game . there many star wars trivia games/books/etc . over years , but star wars trivial pursuit ultimate star wars trivia experience . no fan should pass this game up	1
even better than scrabble , you build words board build words " up " adding letters over existing words . so " tree " becomes " free " " braces " becomes " blades " . scoring might little too easy , but if you're hard core , you use point values scrabble raise score difficulty . board small so you start thinking up instead out fairly soon into game , game doesn't drag too long . it addictive you not look words same way again .	1
i definitely tell when great game show fun board game . unfortunately , absolutely isn't always case . one my all time favorite quiz shows back 80 super password bert convy . game course showcases celebrity regular contestant trying guess their way guess mystery word puzzle . this edition doesn't reflect edition . this board game edition example original password late allen ludden . game still fun enjoyable those who actually haven't seen original password like myself , but it just delightful . unfortunately , it isn't much fun reflecting this version relating bert convy edition . hopefully , when password remade , it just like themed 80 edition nbc game show . price : b-game : 1/2+fun enjoyment : b-overall :	1

x-23 figure availible amazon.com dressed purple but there also black one - variant alot harder find [ i resorted ebay mine ] . build figure great - there so much articulation , it insane ; her feet claws actually tuck under her shoes so they concealed which beyond cool . articulation , most part , great . my only qualm it it makes her arms look funny but i deal . she barely 6 inches tall , i don't expect her perfect . however , reason i'm giving her three stars because i feel purple outfitted one far inferior black outfitted . i recieved my black clad x-23 first expected same figure but purple my other one but i wrong . black x-23 very dark brown hair lays straight lank while purple x-23 hair jet black windblown which makes her head almost impossible move around . also , thing bothers me most x eyes green black suited version but purple suited version , they're orange . i am big x-23 fan i understand when she " triggered " , her eyes go crazy reddish orange , but that not something i really want see sitting top my computer monitor . it kind creepy ! sidenote , when x-23 wear purple ? her comics she either black , dressed civilain or old wolverine costume [ which you see comic comes x-23 ] . i would've prefered variant wearing wolverine costume while black x-23 mass produced . so , personally , i would recommend hunting down variant x-23 your collection . she looks nicer , i think , more true character	1

my 17 month old enjoys playing this kitchen , mimicking mommy . however , past few months she really shown interest kitchen playsets 2+ child stand while using . she doesn't go this kitchen often she used . her , this toy seemed it prime 3 months ( 12-15 months age ) now she moved next level play . it cute toy introduces toddlers kitchen " ideas " , but it either needs more intrigue or younger age start . i think when she 9 months old or even just sitting up she would fun playing parts it-opening refrigerator/microwave/or oven , hitting stove make music play or turning " water " sink make music play . she may more trouble shape sorter then , but i think toys good grow into . i not recommend this 12-month toy . wait few months buy one 2+	1

" game life one first games i purchased , but i could not more disappointed quality " new improved " game . game i grew up buildings , bridges , houses , etc . permanently embedded into game board . new game , these 3d decorations come off placed board each time you play . this my main complaint new game . every time you accidently knock board or brush one buildings your sleeve , they fall off . add this age-old problems people not staying cars spinner not working properly ( it worse new game , way ) game life becomes game frustration . after one game new game board , our family decided we would not play game again . i am now looking auction sites trying find one " old fashioned " game boards . they really took step backwards this one	-1
over all good gift children but i feel maybe you could added few peices paper . thank	1
i bought this my 8 year old . although it took adult read , understand then teach rules play , once we got basic ( classic ) game figured out , it easy . there advance game too , but it too complicated us . we enjoyed it lot , it makes you plan some thinking , where put your ships . my son always wants more more more when it comes battleship . game talks , it closes up carrying handle . makes it more money than other versions , but it well-made worth price	1
if you enjoyed traditional battleship game , you'll really love this game . my only complaint voice announcements bit garbled times . there repeat option hear them again , we used one ! overall , lot fun	1
parker brothers ' classic game , sorry !, one those board games should every household . updated form indian game parcheesi , sorry ! competitive game revenge where players race first get all four their pawns into their " home " square board . game play simple : player turn , he or she draws card middle board . cards numbered 1-12 , there also several special " sorry ! " cards . most numbered cards indicate how many spaces forward player move one his pawns , although some cards special instructions . if player draws card numbered 1 or 2 , they move pawn start onto game board . ( 2 card also allows players draw again . ) 4 card indicates player must move pawn backwards four spaces . if player draws 7 , he option splitting move two pawns . 11 gives player chance switch places opponent pawn . sorry ! card lets player take pawn start place it same square opponent pawn , bumping opponent back start . game play get very fierce intense players race around board , trying first get all four pawns home . if one player pawn bumps into player pawn game board , bumped pawn go back start-which make players really competitive vengeful . sorry ! just one those games everyone should their closet . it easy enough kids play , but it fun grown-ups , too .	1
i remember reading lotr i loved series peter jackson version . once i heard monopoly edition lotr , i excited . i soon won lotr monopoly edition . i came home , invited some relatives soon great time ! you know , monopoly game inwhich you ultimate monopoly . you buy sell property , if you own mt . doom bara-dur ( boardwalk park place original monopoly ) then you get monopoly . you build strongholds ( houses ) fortresses ( hotels ) everytime rival lands your property , then he give you power ( money ) . if you can't pay rent then you'll become bankrupt you out . you also avoid jail . there some new tokens resemble characters lotr . if you look screenshots this monopoly game then you'll notice lot changes . but there new optional rule you play this version ; everytime you roll " eye sauron " ( also counts one ) golden ring move one territory per eye , where you add strongholds . if you land territory ring , you may get it free ! if you land owned territory ring it , you pay double rent . so , if you 100% die-hard lotr only enjoy books , then you miss . but if you looking monopoly board or lotr stuff , i recommend this game thennote : if tolkien lived see this , he would died immediatly . infact , i think he rolling his grave i am typing this review .	1

this product nothing like how i expected it . quality terrible , not waste your money this item	-1
i just got my pink idog today think it just cutest thing . although i am just learning how use it , so far i am just so interested watching it movements colors . problems i encountered it quite difficult " turn " pup off " " button ( nose ) much too sensitive . all you very lightly tap nose pup makes noises . addition , i found batteries pain insert you need screwdriver . i wish like my ipod , there " hold " button avoid accidently activating toy " wasting " expensive batteries . i might make investment buy re-chargable ones avoid cost . anyway , i look forwars using it desk work	1
this comes barely enough paint 2 uses then no info given how get refills store doesn't sell any they don't even tell you what kind paint get . real pain .	-1
description lies , there no minifigures , elite or otherwise , included . unless you money spend additional sets get this vehicle pilot , i wouldn't suggest it anything other then display peice . it shiny though , far i tell mostly accurate game , if not scale other things ( this problem all minifigures ... i suggest 1/6 scale ones instead .	1
this my second purchase , first christmas gift my 2 yr old niece who lives uk . she absolutely adores it , virtual " toys us " environment she lives , this one her favorite toys . it so popular this second purchase birthday gift one her playmates	1
our 19 month old enjoys playing this purse . she enjoys purse itself , cell phone , lipstick most . mirror , keys , wallet , credit card aren't played much . only complaint i she unable open wallet her own . trying open wallet frustrates her no end--it hard young toddler dexterity open such thing	1
entire play tent idea great idea . however , it need little more attention velcro snaps attach tunnels tents together into one unit . it isn't durable enough price . i it out day , my daughter didn't last it . she prefers schoolbus instead . i see this toy breaking down tears very quickly because it little fragile	1
we got this our son month ago . he almost 14 months now , younger than recommended age 3 years , but he never unsupervised when using playhut . our son loves play hide seek ( hiding us , course :)) inside playhut , or just going retrieving balls we toss there him . he doesn't exactly know what basketball hoop yet , but i'm sure come . he lost his balance while playhut knocked it down , but it pops right back up . , since we it up against wall , it more stable anyway . enjoy	1
this set up bit flimsy tunnels don't anything connect them tent . my son still loves it but i wish it bit more sturdy	1
we bought this shopping cart my daughter birthday replace cheapie one she'd before . her previous one cost under $10 ( gift ) there no comparison one little tikes one . old one flimsy get go , faded quickly , when it broke , left sharp edges plastic . little tikes cart much , much sturdier safer . i put it together less than 30 minutes , even my daughter ' help ' . there nice deep basket holds good amount pretend play food or whatever else your child wants push around . seat doll folds against cart just like real shopping cart , easily holds good variety different style dolls . empty shelf under basket nice touch , perfect stashing more groceries . this cart definitely worth extra money , i'd gladly buy it again	1
we bought this cart our 16 month old daughter it hit . she loves pushing her " baby " it filling it " groceries . " i love it so sturdy compared others market very hard tip over . first i wasn't thrilled price but i sold after comparing it others . it very durable high quality . i know this one last .	1
some people hate monopoly , others love it . me , i like it . i've playing it nearly 20 years , ever since i remember . you really should pick up this fantastic board game play it your family children . if you don't , you missing out one amazingly popular game	1
what makes this monopoly version special large tokens difeerent styles houses hotels . i love how they made tokens bigger heavier . also four different styles houses hotels little variety housing . money holder felt it make it little more fancy then standard plastic course case metal instead standard cardboard box . other than it same game . only complaint i i thought looking tin shelf it silver gld colored tin , but it only siver . gold only plastic around tin .	1
we gave this toy our son christmas when he 7 months old he just loved it still almost 1 year old . it fun watching his motor skills improve while using this toy . first he mostly banged noise making nails really grasp ball dropping , storage compartment , crank or spinning ball . little little he added what he could this toy . soon he able get balls out compartment drop them bottom hole , then soon top hole . he now wails little plastic hammer nails just loves it . we haven't replace batteries yet . i highly recommend this toy developing motor skills	1
just wanted write quick review . we older version - we purchased it our daughter when she 9months 2001 !! 4 she still playing it ! it always favorite hers . sometimes we put it away because i thought she wasn't interested it anymore , but when she discovers it or it comes back out , she won't stop playing it .	1
this first real toy we bought my son ( other than real baby toys ) , he 6 months time . moment we brought it home , he loved it ! it comes three balls you drop slot they come rolling out - he never got into part even this day but he loved loves hitting different parts workbench hammer hearing sounds seeing lights flash . it also winding crank some other great little features kids love . now he 20 months although it no longer one main toys he plays i see him go over give it whirl here there i still see same excitment his eyes just like first time . i don't know if i'll ever able get rid this toy not because my son so attached but because i am attached memories his very first toy would hate see it go	1
three us sat down decided try this game we ended up playing 4 hours . it very easy learn yet challenging play . oh , it also lot fun	1
we got this cube before my son born . he enjoyed playing it since he very small . first he would just look it , then he started moving flap bullseye now he grabs all different parts it really manipulates it . different rings sections grab make this great toy child learning reach . my son now six months old he still enjoys this toy	1
our 3 month daughter loves this toy . it multiple shapes colors visual devlopment enough different textures keep her busy while i write this review . very good product	1
my 6 yr . old son received this christmas . he loves it so i ! i think he likes playing hang man best . it cool it light so he play night	1
i came across this item accident while doing my christmas shopping yesterday . not only am i sure my 6 year old son love this ... i love it ! lol ! it really cool . you push top it pops open while wings shoot out . there flashing lights sounds . you put any number codes all beginning bat access games activities . it keyboard it just like real laptop which i am thrilled . now my son type his computer instead mine ! lol ! i played it myself probably half hour . sure there some things he wont able but it wouldnt much fun if he already knew how it . it definately something him awhile . only small complaint i would screen could bigger . size top laptop actual screen used very small . i dont see why they could not utilized more screen still room list bat codes . either way , i am sure any batman fan would love this , any little boy love this ... any mother who looking cool , fun , educational toy love this ! best part me lights you turn . there probably 2 or 3 settings lights help you see screen so much better . great feature well wings which dont really add much except it make any young boy think he something batman might actually use ! i totally reccommend this " toy " anyone boys ages 5 7 or even 8	1
my daughter adores dora asking this toy . she received it christmas thrilled . i love it because it very sturdy toy . babies heavy duty plastic dora half plastic , half cloth . my daughter sleeping dora . she enjoying pretending feed babies put them dora carrier . this toy great play acting well wonderful if you trying get your child ready little brother or sister , although you might want educate your child they won't able carry their new sibling around carrier like dora until they much older	1
let me just say this : my 4 year old certifiable dora nut . she loves her . you could give her bag dora it she'd think it cat meow . but , i must say , mom-mom came through big this toy her 4th birthday . she loves dora feeds twin babies bottle attached her hand . she loves little song dora sings big sister when she presses dora hand . she already singing it around house . feeding accesories cute durable well twin babies themselves all too cute themselves . also , since my four-year old daughter twin well - she twin brother - i think she really relate this toy level well . great toy	1
we 2 these toys - they both same problem others - only says " red pan in/out " if you slam it hard floor it occasionally sing , but this also random . fisher-price rep. not seem surprised when i called report this - told me keep toy i sent me voucher new toy .	1
this toy taught my son how stack day . it such cute toy , my son loves beat everything it . it cute , silly songs , far our toy goes it plays very easy . only thing i don't like spoon , because it doesn't place . if you put it pot then you aren't able sort blocks . overall , it good toy !	1
unlike all bad reviews this doll , i want say how wonderful this doll she everything it says box , i know lot people says she doesn't cry but she it takes while if your child plays her lot feeds her right way she cry , our doll cry every time my daughter squeezes her hand , even my 8 year old son loves make her cry , it over all great doll my daughter dresses her different outfits take her everywhere she goes ...	1

my girls love this kitchen . they play it everyday . it lot storage so you store play food , dishes , etc	1
i bought model refrigerator phone my granddaughter it so precious ! i expecting something screwed together flimsy but kidkraft uses metal screw plugs ( i can't remember what they really called ) put this together it very sturdy screws won't strip out pressed wood . ( it weigh 80 #s ! ) hardware used put this together all organized little tray so it very easy me find what i needed , normally you spend first hour sorting out screws . directions pretty easy follow , i only problems figuring out how attach top but it only took me few minutes get it right . i am woman who my own tools so i tackled this project myself it took me couple hours , if i help it probably would completed much more quickly . ( i recommend tearing off page tray items keep handy so you aren't constantly flipping back page since you need tray items every step . ) my granddaughter eyes lit up when she saw it she played there hours ( she three january loves play pretend ) . this such cute addition her girly room i simply love pastel colors . i love quality design . perfect	1
just purchased this my 7 year old son cerebral palsey- he only use his right hand- this cartridge perfect- game not allow mistakes play this cartridge only one hand not both . since my son use only one hand he trouble playing other vsmile games- he hooked . very engaging also where some other games fall short	1

luckiest outcome prequel trilogy clone wars cartoon . all toys this series fantastic . my daughter literally gasped when i showed her display i'd made . tiger shark gunship good addition line	1
parker brothers ' classic game , sorry !, one those board games should every household . updated form indian game parcheesi , sorry ! competitive game revenge where players race first get all four their pawns into their " home " square board . game play simple : player turn , he or she draws card middle board . cards numbered 1-12 , there also several special " sorry ! " cards . most numbered cards indicate how many spaces forward player move one his pawns , although some cards special instructions . if player draws card numbered 1 or 2 , they move pawn start onto game board . ( 2 card also allows players draw again . ) 4 card indicates player must move pawn backwards four spaces . if player draws 7 , he option splitting move two pawns . 11 gives player chance switch places opponent pawn . sorry ! card lets player take pawn start place it same square opponent pawn , bumping opponent back start . game play get very fierce intense players race around board , trying first get all four pawns home . if one player pawn bumps into player pawn game board , bumped pawn go back start-which make players really competitive vengeful . sorry ! just one those games everyone should their closet . it easy enough kids play , but it fun grown-ups , too .	1
it game * sweet revenge * . who wouldn't like this came , game played decades decades . i remember sitting our sunny sunroom my brother playing when we both children , i am now mother family daycare provider my son ( 6 yrs ) children i care enjoy playing . after school my son older children run get game play instead turning tv 7 times out 10 they pick sorry . this game played children young 3 or 4 yrs children young 101 . this game everyone should own !!! i think i am going go now , get my son game sorry	1
we bought this kitchen my 3 yr old son christmas . after searching through other kitchens we decided this one many reasons . first we liked it not huge overbearing , minimal sounds electronic functions there still plenty room using his imagination which important us . both burners light up , one makes " frying " sound , other " boiling " sound . it compact enough move around easily , we like keep it kitchen well living room outside nice days . secondly we liked chicco got it right regards usually discriminating gender biased kitchen sets pinks purples . subdued primary colors used chicco kitchen making it appealing both genders . lastly price this kitchen bargain compared others out there , especially since we not sure how much my son would really use it . although my son played it company child ease , i would reccomend getting something bigger if you two children constantly playing kitchen it rather small or conjunction other kitchen items placed near it like microwave or coffee pot , so focus not just one item given time	1
after surveying lots kitchen sets , i decided buy star kitchen my kids( 1.5 1.2 years old ) . it turned out great choice . my kids love it , i love it , too .	1
my daughter earlier version one shown so it possible they addressed some these issues : 1 ) most games 1 minute time out which really frustrating my kids2 ) " oh that not so good " - if i hear barbie say one more time i may just throw this thing out nearest window . my daughter get score game she feels really good barbie says , " oh that not so good , but you'll better bit more practice " this broken my daughter down into tears more than once . 3 ) there no parental controls . i wanted turn off or lengthen timer . i expected those sorts features oregon scientific . right now most fun thing my kids it play flower fun game ( like hangman ) type " icup " if you looking newer version this i would strongly recommend playing demo few minutes check it out	1
i bought this my 5 year old son who loves draw . crayons cheap , compared crayola . we tested 10 different reds searching correct " spiderman " red , but they all looked too pink , pretty much same color . also really waxy . oil crayons terrible , totally waxy - no oil all . markers ok ( so far ) , but why provide two each color same thin tip ? they could given broad thin tip marker each color instead . case seem pretty sturdy , so worst case i'll replace contents better quality art supplies . i'm going look around something better ... if i find it , this going back toys us . any ideas ?	1
case cheaply made box wood not even survive shipping . materials contained inside poor quality . rating not deserve one star . i returned it due damage sustained shipping , but it would returned regardless because it garbage !	-1
my 3 year old daughter loves art . she found this toy store i not want buy it because it little pricey art supplies . but she really enjoyed this . it little bit everything it . she used up almost everything it . but she still uses it organize her other arts crafts stuff	1
set great rule book refreshed my memory . item not come color shown . i wanted pink one i got red taupe set . kind disappointing	1
this really fun adults . we get together once month we really enjoy company , food spirits . this meant adults solicize not children . i am sure they might learn somehting gathering . i really enjoyed bunco .	1
all our children love temporary tattoos . this one special because you color them yourself . we purchased this my son 7th birthday it great birthday activity all . needless say , i rest our guests covered art when day through . tattoos stay fairly well if you don't get scrubbing them too hard easy put , they don't stick peel like some we've tried . they offer varied styles tattoos , everything dragons sports . all all this great fun !	1
grandchild loved this gift . her her friends made tattoos everyone . there so many styles choose they really lasted . would buy again minute .	1
i trouble believing this small children . i tried play this party some friends . all us who tried play our 20s 30s , we couldn't figure out how game supposed work . dvd never makes it clear whose turn it or what really happening , there too many things added game original . i've played regular , classic version clue many times enjoy it , but this new version frustrating , complicated , not fun all . i can't imagine children would actually fun this when four adults couldn't even figure out what going	-1
this extremely fun addictive game . you shuffle cards , place three ( room , weapon , person ) secret envelope . every room you go into , you make accusations . if someone card you accused ( like room ) , then they show it you you write it down your notepad . game changes constantly , so it never gets boring . character pieces teeny details , like mr. green straps buckles his briefcase . i gave it 4 stars education because it teaches you focus really think . oh , good problem-solving skills too . coordination ( you add all clues up see who it ) . all all , terrific game . great rainy days or playdates . i mention weapons ? very realistic . cute	1
i always loved b-wings told myself one day i would get one . these new releases caught my eye so i spent my own money get one . i not disappointed . b-wing awesome !!! it copies design features fighter movie very carefully , so it good-looking model actually , b-wing movie pretty ugly , this copies ship movie , but i've played enough video games respect its firepower . i guess it doesn't look too bad . it nice lego , but nothing perfect . here pros cons . pros : good 15 inches tall , this thing monster ! it looks really neatthe service tower nice thing realistic playwith tower display stand , this thing looks cool your bedroomfor huge fighter , it actually easy play withthis thing would probably rock star wars ship battles kids like me its 7 guns . not too hard buildcons : kind expensiveit doesn't break often , but when it , it tough repairit not too hard build , but it take whileit doesn't balance too well service tower/display stand because it so heavy . don't touch it though you'll finethe ten numb minifigure doesn't look too good my opinionyou open s-foils manually . you think lego would little gear-wheel open it . missiles zip range , but lego never really came through missile department anywayengines look bit tiny compared rest modelthe mechanic minifigure(whichever one you choose use , i like use ten numb minifigure)doesn't lot room stand onthe pilot minifigure kind hard fit inoverall , most flaws tiny it really cool ship worth $35	1
we enthusiastically played candy land each our three kids . it easily best starting point introducing child board games . players take turns drawing deck moving their pieces around board . cards one or two squares particular color ( such red , green , yellow , etc . ) players move pieces ahead path next matching spot same color . no counting or reading required . there also special cards move player ahead or behind , they indicated picture spot board which player should move their piece . play continues until one player reaches end . some my observations : 1 ) most kids probably start playing enjoying this game before recommended 36 months age . if you child attention span desire sit down 10-15 minute game , i'm pretty confident they could enjoy it . 2 ) among lessons our kids learned candyland : taking turns , recognizing colors , dealing disappointment . luckily , games quick enough it usually possible play multiple games one seting . this makes it possible keep playing until each child least one win . ( very helpful managing little egos)3 ) such simple game , it manages perfectly balance possibility changes fortune without seeming arbitrary . game literally doubt until last card played ( one " special " cards might send player back near start ) . this great teaching most valuable lessons : " never give up " . 4 ) most simple games , it almost impossible get older kids play after they reach certin age . we not found true candy land . we've games adult kids ages 3 , 6 , 9 playing together fun . if you more than one kid , you know how hard this . parent three , i give this game my highest recommendation	1
fabulous kitchen which i purchased my 2 year old grandaughter . i first saw it home recently sold me . i impressed quality appearance . upon speaking other parents discovering their children used this " toy " least until 9 , i inclined spend money . needless say , my grandaughter thrilled . i kitchen my home office both her mother i feel free use computer while she playing next us	1
i bought deluxe version this kitchen so there would plenty room my 2 3.5 year old use it same time . it big but it worth it ! it christmas present they play it daily . there plenty storage within kitchen play food pots/pans dishes although we use back up box overflow . it comes two big boxes but assembly fairly straight forward . it took me 1.5 hours power screwdriver ( i cannot imagine putting this together without one ) . few minor issues : description calls 14 aa batteries . it actually used 12 aa batteries phone used 2 aaa batteries . shipping very expensive . i wish i more homework either gotten lower price or free shipping . few screws difficult get place because there not enough room use power screwdriver ( or any screwdriver ) straight . screws battery plate phone very small one got stripped when trying take back plate off insert batteries . i not any problems other reviewers mentioned regarding doors not closing properly . everything fits tightly aligned well . overall i love style kitchen . it not garish like most play kitchens . everyone get kick out all appliances working light over sink . this toy that full details probably over my kids ' heads this time but appreciated more they get older . well worth money floor space ! but forget quiet moment read newspaper . my kids find best time cook something me	1

our son received this gift , we sent it back . box made inferior wood , very poorly constructed . not really " constructed " all - rather just glued together , not well , . two corners coming apart . also , lid opens two parts . drawback : when you open or close either side , plastic trays inside hold crayons pastels , fall out , there nothing securing them box . so , you try hold tray place while closing either side . we can't comment supplies themselves , we not allow our son try them , or else he would not able return item .	-1

i purchased wooden version this toy over plastic version because i thought wooden would more durable . i cannot speak plastic set , but wooden set certainly not made way it when i child . i bought this christmas present , month later many parts damaged . many ends rods cracked off . few rods broke when i playing my two daughters , so i know breakage occured during average gentle play . i very disapointed overall quality . this classic toy now produced overseas , not toy it once .	-1

when i first purchased this board , my expectations high , however what i met left me absolute disappointment . avid go players , this not board you . although if you real avid go player you would purchased 7000 dollar kaya board , however my budget doesn't allow it . this board workmanship quite well , no matter how you play it , go go , online , board , paper , etc . now heart matter , major problem this particular brand board , size . stones also poor , but you not expect top quality stones cheap this board . however , boards size , which incredibly small doesn't allow you use other brands stones if you've purchased them . so you stuck tiny board , terrible tiny plastic stones lighter than feather . playing experience isn't pleasant one false move scatter pieces everywhere you say goodbye game . my advice : not purchase this board unless you beginner unable get anything else , but even then i think beginner would greater experience playing paper , adequate ing stones . or perhaps play online . overall , this board terrible	1
" let make sentence " subject predicate color coded . my son matches colors doesn't read them make sentence . level 2 you make sentence it timed . he just hits colors .

imagine if you cat , would you ... 1 . ) nap all day 2 . ) bring your owner dead mice 3 . ) scaredy cat 4 . ) constantly cough up hairballs . you know what you would , but perhaps everyone else thinks differently you , unfortunately , majority rules . we loved this game . this game you write names board dry erase marker . each person rolls die they move around board landing certain names then reading " imaginiff " question person . names you all choose write board those people playing , people you all know who not there , or even famous people , it all up you . fact , aspect game makes game virtually brand new every time you play it . we many laughs finding out what we all thought each other . don't thin skin though because you might just leave bitter taste your mouth	1

unless you perfectly flat yard golf-course grade grass absolutely no twigs , leaves , pinecones , moisture , or variations ground level , this thing won't go . flat concrete it seems ok . yard , however , we forever pushing this thing around because it cannot go it own . wheels constantly spinning out . we bought it 3rd birthday gift my son . obviously , he would like ride it , but we hardly ever use it because my husband i hate walking behind him pushing ! we thought we purchased great thing after all reviews . we wanting him fun help us yard work hauling sticks/leaves/pinecones around . how wrong we . it fairly easy step-by-step assembly . we no breakage or charging problems , but we don't use it very often because major traction problem . it seem stay charged quite awhile even after long amounts time storage . we bought this after lot research . these people who think this thing so great must flat concrete yards . i never spent so much money so disappointed .	-1
my son received this gator christmas few years ago . it provided hours fun him his friends , but i am still disappointed ... 1 ) tires lousy traction - slip grass , snow dirt2 ) battery pain get out charging ... compartment way too small make this simple task ... it takes 5-10 minutes , if you put bar back too . 3 ) fragile !!! totally not durable ! windshield snapped clean off , one clips front grill where you need change battery also snapped off , reverse function broke we order new part my husband fix it ... once it fixed , week later gears totally stripped ! i pretty happy this toy until my friend got power wheels grave digger her son . battery pops out 2 seconds , charge indicator dash toy , runs awesome even wet grass , more pep than tractor 2 kids it . i'm shopping right now ride-on our son , i'm going stick power wheels this time	-1
doll looks very princely his arms bend , which great . helps my kids put his clothes .	1
my daughter really keen this doll eventually i relented bought it . it proven extremely disapppointing . expression face quite inane , it quickly relegated used bit patsy toy . character pegasus flawed , but he isn't stupid . i annoyed crown , he wasn't , after all prince - he may become one , but not during movie so why put crown his head ? my daughter really wanted ice skates him one key features this movie . none these characters come skates it seems , yet there huge ice skating scene start , least twice movie lovely double one end . i really like manufacturers tried make expressions smiling pleasant however i can't recall aiden doing it once movie . seems it designed independently movie without reference it looks . plus side , costume stuff all right used other dolls . it all seems very well sewn hardwearing	1
toy looked like it would made wood , but it made cheap plastic	-1
we buy lots melissa doug toys puzzles , but this one really pretty " cheesy " definitely not worth $$ . first one we received also defective/didn't work . i've seen much better versions so i would shop around	-1
i picked this up i hadn't played golden tee years , thought it worthwhile 35 bucks . i got it home , played it , enjoyed it few people , still enjoy it few people . however , you get very bored this , very fast . game , while graphics don't really deter me ... there not much differentiation power levels . also ... if you slice or hook ball , game allows you hit 475+ yard drives consistantly . may sound amazing , but it gets really boring when you finish round -24 . trackball very stiff , extremely easy gain full power . problem this game requires very little finess . it hit it hard you right club . there only one course , after you play it your buddies twice you bored it . it isn't real golden tee , but hey .. it 40 bucks . i've bought video games much more than less staying power . if you golden tee fanatic , you probably not enjoy this game . if you take it game away real golden tee , then you enjoy it . don't expect playing this every day , or spending hours hours mastering i t.t his game worth around , but it nothing spectacular	1
this really fun piece . bought it my 6 month old , but my 3 year old also playing it . plus it looks nice . stickers wheels ( you see picture ) came off but i glued them back . it seems like sturdy piece . i am happy this purchase would recommend it others	1
i bought 2 these cars my sister twin boys . they both around 4 years old you imagine very hard toys . i say they very excited this car . push button engine it makes several cool sounds even if you roll car forward it makes " revving " or " peeling out " sound . they really liked this . i little concerned roof opening accessing cockpit . it looked prone break i warn them both which completely ignored within hour both tops popped off . this actually designed very well very easy pop roof back . seems it made young destructive hands . overall car very sturdy , aesthetically pleasing great toy . only downside this car it not come batman figure . sad manufacture makes you go out find figure separately . anyway , i prepared this also bought them two batman exp figures which they could easily fit car . this car real hit kids receive lots rough play	1

i purchased this game my 12 year old son christmas . since he no siblings , i am usually his oppponent all games . this game challenging both us , used strategy well luck , moved quickly enough we stayed interested , easy start playing without read huge amount rules instructions . i think it helps math skills , too , but isn't so difficult younger players wouldn't enjoy it also . i also like how it stores all pieces into its plastic frame keep all game pieces together . it also some ideas how play solitare game if you can't find someone play . altogether great game	1
my son got this his first birthday loved it past 4 months . he learned very quickly how place balls top hit them hammer . he squeals while he watches balls roll through mirrored maze inside ... it very cute . only problem i it he figured out how stuff all sorts small toys into holes top , including his fisher price little people animals . they get into toy , but i take screwdriver open back get them out . i wish it unsnapped easier free trapped toys , but upside it very durable hard toddler destroy	1

i bought this gift someone else embarrassed how cheap it looked when we opened it . top it off , sand timer all glued or stuck together so only element game which you couldn't make yourself didn't even work . parts look like they're worth less than $0.25 boards pieces ridiculously cheap . they could've least put extra nickel or two into spinner , key element game . it , i think kindergartner could make this game their arts crafts hour . i'd recommend traditional word games like scrabble or boggle instead this .	-1
i purchased wordplay because i am always look out games educational dimension . my son ( aged 9 ) seems taken quite liking it , which great since he tends shy away anything he says `feels like school ' . he loves spinner middle game board ( nice touch ) , idea `spinning get your letters ' ( which then used form words ) . words themselves left child imagination vocabulary skills , ensuring game remains flexible interesting . even when he not playing some his friends , my son sometimes comes up me asks i spin him ( so he proudly show me words he formed using `my ' letters ) . all all , very smart . sometimes simplest ideas really best	1

concept , this great toy . design , however , it many flaws . backdrop piece just not stay attached ! ( i actually fun-tacked it wall behind where cloud kingdom sits my daughter playroom . ) clouds pieces , while very pretty , just not solid enough hold up . sure make plenty space this toy because it takes up 3 feet room not fold away storage . my 4-year-old not seem mind any this , though . it really inspire her imaginative play she flies her pegasi through sky	-1
see solve visual calculator really useful helping young ones who just learning their math skills . actually see problem screen very productive understanding what child doing . i , grandmom , hard time pushing numbers , but may just me , because my grandson no problem all . i would recommend this gift or aid help math	1

after looking stores , catalogs online we decided order this table our two year old son . even though price bit more than i felt we needed spend it worth it . quality great legs thick sturdy our son loves it ! course he loved helping me attach legs which simple after we comvinced him turn it over he delighted belly up his colors books . we feel this great quality piece easily incoporated into his room bedside table or end table after he out grows its current purpose	1
this tent works great out home . great fortress within home , or get baby off grass sand outside . it takes up some square feet , but if you room , it fun play . assembly time probably 5-10 mins one person . more use , i'm sure it assembled faster pace . one side stays open , but masked sheet or blanket ( if you would like your baby stay inside ) . my 9 month baby i easily fit within tent , much room grow . easy disassembly . this tent job getting baby out sun , great place naps when out . this low price , nothing compares . stows away neatly easily small bag ( approx 4x12 inches ) .	1
this projector just what everyone above saying ... useless ... not go buy it !! i give it " 0 " stars . negatives very hard make out . i couldn't tell if i looking earth or venus	-1
we received this gift . it worthless . there little or no 3-d effect . slides little interest	1

this happens one my favorite toys ( i collect toys ) . it socute it outragous-whenever i see it , i can't help but smile . i keepdarth tater up top my left audio speaker tower , he one thefirst things you see when entering my living room . this great toy concept , those us who never forgottenour potato head days , this bring them back smile . very easy put together , but i would not buy it small child , asthere some smallish plastic parts they might swallow = very definitely toy us scifi/emorabilia lovers . honey , i remember when first tater heads came out , you stickthe plastic parts into real potato ! so this all-plastic version avery pleasant update . this would make great office toy ...... i give this five smilies up !!! : -	1
my husband received this gag present , my 3 year old daughter loves it . it far her favorite her mr. potato head collection , spudtrooper . i'm not sure if it lightsaber or cape , but something this toy captivates her . if you're mr. potato head fan , whether young or old , this must . we're looking forward adding artoo-potatoo family when he available also . :	1
my almost 5 year old son loves driving his jeep all over neighborhood . because better handling wheel design ( not slanted ) , jeep remarkably agile . what my kid so far : - taken jeep off road bike trails- drive through iced dirt- drive through 1/2 " mud- drive through 1/4 " water puddles- pull passengers tied wagon ( we almost died laughing)i agree previous reviewer car bit big sub 3 year old , but my younger one ( 2.5 ) loves passenger .	1
this great older kids adults . too powerful little ones	1
we planned getting one these houses our daughters 6 3 share but toys us them b1g1 october so they each got one christmas . i am amazed detail put into these houses . they look great really durable . we bought 6 rooms worth furniture there still least dozen more playsets they get go it . girls love it it really gives them chance use their imagination	1
i surprised how enchanted my daughter this house because she hard buy . most toys i think she love sit collecting dust . she four years old i chose buy her doll house xmas this year because i remember loving my doll house so much when i her age . i also owned fisher price doll house , so i wasn't turned off all plastic . i admit i disappointed how cheaply made house seemed when we pulled it out box , but after two weeks ( her twin baby sisters getting into it every chance they get ) it holding up well . yes , twin time doll house right up our ally ! i love how it mimics our real life family so well ( exception hair color , twin boy , pink decor ) . i especially like furniture sets , they attractive , interesting play , seem well made . it drag everything bought separately . more corporate greed i assume . house should least include kitchen , bathroom , bedroom , family room . rest rooms could optional . what up silly little kitchen sink cheapo furniture comes it ? least decency lower cost additional ten bucks house empty . exception baby cribs , these items not get played once " nice " furniture arrives . i bought her doll house walmart , so it came big sister her bedroom set , which nice addition . family members bought her kitchen , bathroom , laundry room , family room , dinning room . i think it would nice parents bedroom , too . house certainly too small accommodate all furniture sets . i would prefer house doesn't fold but larger rooms . i question how well this house would hold up if it constantly folded up . my other recommendation fisher price add stair case . my doll house winding black stair case definitely fun feature . overall i like house , but i think it could use some tweaking .	1
i am so glad i got this gift my husband . we our friends played this game over over again . i just love it . rules sometimes not specific but we just make house rules cover any questions . we enjoy it so much we wish it larger so more than 4 people could play . great buy !	1
this game highest quality we quite pleased every aspect it . wooden dice , pewter ships , velvet treasure bags , cloth map , plastic gems hefty metal doubloons ... everything just so " neat " . we all enjoyed checking out details it all . far gameplay goes , i don't understand why some people would problem dice rolls . one aspect game play we truly enjoy . it exciting try outroll your fellow players , if you're lucky enough dread pirate you get add +1 your roll , it brings some educational value game . part game we found both educational fun cards come into play when you land certain spaces map . cards directions you follow , they also tidbits historical facts them . our entire family loves this game , it enjoyable all ages , our 5 year old all way up us 36 year olds . it very easy learn play , even younger children . there basic game rules there also advanced rules older crowd who've gotten used gameplay first few times around . i highly recommend this game those who looking family games both educational entertaining . i also recommend it those who fans all things pirate .	1
we bought this croc our son ( 5 ) who loves anything hot wheels found most cars don't work this . also , sounds annoying point my son wanting it stop .. which very rare . half time crocs mouth won't drop shut , i agree one other reviews saying it nearly impossible get car boat . we tried tried got it there once . most time car never even made it boat because it flipped over after dropping crocs mouth . amazon correct charging only $5 this toy , it not worth any more than .	1
this set great age range , it various activities different physical levels . we know we'll get several years ' use out it . it really difficult put together , but feels very sturdy well-made regardless	1
good toy . soft , cuddly , well made . my kids love webkinz website . they very happy cocker spaniel toy	1

even though webkinz toy website fun my daughter , we lost tag tried contacting customer service two months !!! no response emailing through our email , their website or calling . why they say you 14 years or older call , if o-o ne answering calls anyway !!! i don't plan buy , or suggest anyone else buy one either , until they improve their customer service . what kick face !!!	-1
this set certainly used toy kids . however , its real purpose more decorative than functional . it designed display hardcore halloween horror fans . regard , it outstanding . michael myers looks just i'd picture him first two movies . however , i am really impressed what they dr. loomis . loomis sort guy who , if you don't get likeness right , easily come out looking like lenin . figure looks good something this size range look . other features quite good , well . steps surroundings attractive . ( they screw you out shrubs pictured box , however . ) overall , i thought this beautifully . effect quite authentic . everything looks just one would hope . i hope they eventually create more these , commemorate later films , well . ( i personally would pay heavily see loomis released featuring his 2by4 part 5 . ) if they make one , they'll hard time topping this one	1

my son who absolutely loves all sports cannot get enough hoop challenge ! two balls , pump over door hoop complete separate led scoring even crowd noises what not love ? he play himself practice his free throws " three pointers " or he challenge his dad or me or even his sister game one one . coolest thing this hoop actually recognizes which ball goes scores accordingly ! balls color coded : white black . only reason i gave this only 4 stars it doesn't always score correctly it score if anything breaks sensor rim , like your hand . scores only go up one point instead two . also , crowd noises get bit much ; what would really improve this if you could dual switch where you crowd noises or off , but you listen them if you want use scoring system . but this one coolest most often used toys our house loved many many years come	1
pretty pretty princess cinderella edition game one our five year old daughter favorite games . we fun gluing stickers trying match our jewelry set . wear jewelry adds fun . it easy game learn play . her grandmother enjoyed playing this game even glued sparkling craft pieces bottom jewelry box , much delight our little princess . previous reviewer mentioned game not ' educational ' . while i , too , like educational games , i don't think every game educational . sharing time play together rewarding itself . pretty pretty princess game simply sweet little girl game , one all three generations fun playing .	1
my 5 year old got this present liked it . however , her 3 year old little sister plays it enjoys it more . it seem little too simple older ones but it entertaining . also , it tend get little boring you continue play since it seems take some time finally win . actually we never played it till someone wins because they seem grow tired it before happens . all all , this good board game it fun play ... just maybe not till end	1
this wood version game wonderfully durable . it looks attractive when playing when shelf . it classic aged look	1
even though this puzzle intended children , it use . my blind mother wished she could remember placement all states . she said " if only they made puzzle-like product all states which would talk when you pressed each state . " i searched searched through all catalogs products made visually impared people found nothing . then friend showed me melissa doug usa map sound puzzle she bought child . wow ! this exactly what i looking . my mom found puzzle easy use spent hours it . voice loud clear . so far , she able remove each piece , listen information , replace it without getting " lost " . only negatives this kind use intended use take all pieces out , then put them back one-by-one . blind person , you take each piece out separately put it back before taking next piece out . getting inland state out bit difficult . also , some smaller states grouped into one piece , so blind person only tell states grouped , but can't tell how they relate geographically each other . its intended use child puzzle , it would work fine . just make sure your child over age where he or she would try swallow piece . they small choking hazard	1
it fun ! colour awesome . so many new things , i never bored again	1
i looked every where this ! then i found it toysrus online but they dont it they ran out . man i wish i could one	1

i worried my 15 month-old young start playing legos , but she proved me wrong . she loves them play even alone . these little bit smaller than first set we got , but still bigger than their regular size older kids . i would recommend this toy everyone small children : it improves their motorical skills coordination	1

if you've mastered 3x3 cube looking challenge , go 4x4 . we all know , competitive cubing almost exclusively 3x3 ... however , if you want bone up your cubing skills this great training cube . there so many more combinations permutations cube coloring 4x4 design ... think it , there 96 sub-cubes this version vs . 54 original 3x3 cube . like many other rubik products , this cube not flawless . stickers peel easy there bit squeak twist action . i wouldn't use competition , but like i said 4x4s rarely used competition . buy training aid	1
i love rubik cube i myself solve regular rubik cube but not big one problem though stickers they peel off second day you use it they need go back way they it eighty paint way i don'y buy new one every time sticker falls	1
this super well-constructed toy , simple straightforward . my son really likes it . before he ready put shapes their individual holes , he would just dump them out put them back top . his hand fits fine into top hole . it little weighty , but that not bad thing , especially since recent studies shown kids who play weighted toys better muscle tone . i'm knocking off star because , previous reviewer mentioned , vertical slots trickier use than slanted ones	1
guy i work really r/c planes his enthusiasm finally spilled over me . i recently bought this dominator just because i wanted " wing " dual motors ... so i went wally world plunked down $30.00 this thing . first , plane sharp right turn cartwheeled blacktop our parking lot ! surprisingly , there only few scuffs ... my buddy bent rudders little we tried it again it flew pretty straight he got it up least 200 ' air it pretty awesome ! i then flew it few times no crashes , but it kind hard control .... you need lot space fun this thing . something remember : absolutely double charge batteries every time ! my flight times around 5-7 minutes each time . i've learned get it way up air soon possible then only few touches left or right .... it glides pretty nice cheap little plane . it look cool air i like sound motors when turning ... i'd recommend it , but only fly it someone experienced them first ..... overall , i'd buy it again !... oh , use clear packing tape leading edges wings ! trust me , it makes difference ...	1
these creature peepers wonderful !! our 4-year-old just loves his ! before we this , he always bringing his newly-found " friends " into house . yuck !! since buying creature peeper , he still brings his 6 8-legged " friends " into house- but now i am much calmer it ! he loves catch all sorts bugs study them through magnifying scopes top bottom this toy . great fun curious children !	1
my 5 year old sleeps this weekends . it very durable . we've it long time . ones who said it won't go up or collapses easily ... you didn't assemble it correctly . it folds up nicely under bed it expands so well it bit difficult move through hallway . luckily it bendable . i don't know playing it though . it kind small unless it 2 year old or younger . our son only sleeps it	1
tent too flimsy . it can't support itself , it light feather it gets pushed all aover place my kids . they don't even play it anymore ' cause they over it	-1
before i talk toy , everyone please note you must also purchase tyco pro flexpack battery pack . i'm sure it just oversight part amazon toys us . however , ad shell shocker only states toy requires 2 aa batteries . so wrong . ad also shows people who purchased shell shocker also purchased tmh flexpak battery pack charger . i followed , but mislead . top it all off , because we opened package , we charged shipping return it . wait ! there more . when you search amazon correct battery pack , you redirected bananatoys.com (...) toys us worked it out us though . our local toys us store battery pack in-stock (...) , allowed us return incorrect product store , they credited cost wrong battery shipping charges . thank you toys us . toy . it amazing . we bought shell shocker our grandson seventh birthday . he absolutely loves it ! i'm sure who more fun it -- him , his dad , or his grandfather . watch tail -- it inflict pain . but if you're aware careful , it just blast play watch	1

twin 4 year old girls , i vast experience little houses , castles , etc ... this toy far exceeds most them out there , including many disney products barbie castles . pieces small , yet manageable sturdy . there enough " tricks " ( working light , mailbox , etc .. ) keep it interesting , yet not so many it too much preschooler . miniature little ponies adorable fun play . i impressed product considering affordable price ($22 it came extra free pony ) . i paid $20 already barbie castle only comes tiny thin miniature plastic pieces ( always get lost ) thin , cheap plastic structures nothing ( no lights , etc .. ) this product well worth it	1
i bought this after reading reviews positive this little gym . 3 months age he enjoy kicking gym getting music started . my sister-in-law says while yes it loud , it isn't anything seems bothersome my nephew . it gets his attention keeps it .... little while least	1
my son likes playing this toy now he sit up green bench play buttons . when he younger not able sit , we would put him under it him kick bench . when he able kick it hard enough make it play music , toy would move across room because there no traction bottom it prevent it moving . this great toy when kids able actually play , but not good toy use kicker .	1

parachute play , we campers ranging two years old over 60 , everyone able participate- together . little ones ran under billowing , bright nylon . they played giant beach ball under covering like they their own live forthouse , then we put ball top see how many consecutive times we could cooperatively toss it parachute center , then catch it send it aloft again . game possibilities endless . ten sturdy , comfortable web handles all around edges made it manageable big little hands alike . parachute packs up small light its accompanying nylon bag , so we could use it filler play 5 minutes activities , take it beach anytime warm up water , even tote it our hike use instant shade when draped over piece string strung two trees ! every family taking road trip should one these standard travel gear soft frisbee kickball . one unexpected benefit : this perfect solution if you're looking colorful , lively photo op advertise camp , children program , cooperation seminar , or just capture memory make your heart smile	1

this toy seems unfinished cheaply made . i got it $15 toys us i certainly wouldn't pay more it . it small , doesn't on/off switch , characters barely look like themselves . it definitely doesn't look like it last long , just not well made . but ... my 15 month old daughter loves it . my 3 6 year old boys got bored it really quick but it keep my daughter interest . she loves wiggles . characters pop up down when you play they keyboard it easy little guys play it . i hate toys marketed little kids it too hard them manipulate it make it work . music quality isn't too bad it two different volumes . not annoying adults . music only plays couple seconds time . not bad toy but they could so much better .	1
our son loves this toy . details accurate , size ideal small child , because very study design , it practically indestructible ! i only wish playmobil made more models . ( yes , there many small parts we added back he grown into toy- also great point- it sophisticated enough last more than 6-8 months	1

this truly great game underscores adage quot ; keep it simple , stupidquot ; ! all ages play ... even my 2 year old pull out stick see if made marble fall . i only one complaint ... quality physical aspect game . course i kerplunk kid tube tray amp ; sticks much heavier plastic . this kerplunk you must hold tube pull stick out or whole shebang fall over . maybe original classic version produced . i noticed this same skimping other great games such quot ; troublequot ; quot;don't break icequot ; etc ... i would pay few more dollars better quality but suggest you buy it quot ; isquot ; anyway	1

tried buckets dinosaurs ? this great addition box ( plus they make smaller unmoving version which great offspring ) .	1
o my gosh ! its best game ever ! game you just daring enough bid your money ... it really cool game price	1
i don't think this toy could made any cheaper . ours cracked several places , even though it hardly played ... my kids really not hard toys , destroying this one . we also bought drumset little tikes , but returned it , because it broke before i could even assemble it . disappointing . this keyboard just doesn't live up my expectations little tikes products	-1
this given my 3 year old daughter her sister christmas . microphone broke putting it together . i couldn't find reciept so customer service made me pay 5.00 send new one which took 8 weeks !! customer service not through little tikes which explains poor service we got , not mention customer serv . rep . accussed me it months just wanting get new microphone . stand useless if you move it bottom comes apart over over over !!! however , my little girl love keyboard all differrent melodies flashing lights etc .. she loves singing i like it makes her happy until base comes apart bottom . it carry handle ( used out base ) but it bit bulky little hands carry around . i say company needs improve stand/base this product .	1
this well made price works well temporary use , particularly since it folds stores nicely under bed if necessary . my granddaughter happily played ate table able entertain playmate extra chair . just note , require some assembly	1
i purchased this camera my two grandchildren . i truly disappointed product , i think kids too ; they showed no real interest using it or playing immediate .	-1

i searched really long time other night see if quantum books work leap pad pro systems . i never found answer . i almost ordered quantum my 9-year-old granddaughter but decided wait . discount store i saw books , it clearly states book it work all leap pad systems except my first leap pad . what relief . saved me $40	1
little boys love this toy . they all want sanitation workers once they get playing it	1
dizzy really cool toy . her cement " dumps " out , but stays attached ( no small part worry ) . front " head " bends so she stand like show when saying " brilliant " . her front wheels move slightly like show . rear magnet used lot lofty lifts dizzy out cement ( like one books ) . held up 2 months bathtub hard play . these take alongs so much better than talkies just right size children	1
i recommend all little tikes " rugged rigz " vehicles . they large , sturdy work well . little tikes bulldozer one best , though , my son favorite . it tracked bulldozer/loader , blade raises lowers ( blade locks three different levels " flips up " unload sand/toys it scooped up ) . tractor makes series diesel engine/backing sounds when your child pushes large red button top . these sounds continue intermittently long child pushes toy around , but unlike some toys , sound not start until they press button . your little construction engineer love this toy	1
i bought this my 17 month old son because he loves water things spin . i looked few sand water tables settled this one because spinning accessories ( they all seemed pretty similar otherwise ) comprably , price pretty good , too . i must say , we really pleased this purchase . not only my son love it , but i found it very well made . its really easy put together ( no tools needed ! ) but still nice sturdy . it also lightweight easy store . entire table breaks down compact storage . table two deep sections ( so far we've used both water- maybe we'll sand future ) its nice height toddlers , it comes some really cute accessories . scoops perfect little hands accesories sturdy , too . they withstood some abuse my son . it sectional lid , so you could one side covered while leaving other open , or cover both . lid fits nicely little road design top , so when not used messy stuff , it could also serve play surface . overall , i'm very pleased . i think its well worth price . its not cheap , sure ( considering its just molded plastic ) but i learned pretty quickly kids stuff just expensive- even junk- so i guess my expectations low ;) . we try not overindulge our son ' stuff ' , but felt toy like this would serve multi-educational purpose , so we splurged . pleased say we weren't disappointed .	1

my 3 year old spent total 7 minutes playing this book before she asked put different book into her leap pad . when i encourage her use pooh again , she absolutely refuses . she loves her pooh characters loves her leap pad . but this book ? it never touched again . it seems simple , 3 year olds need challenge	1
i pay lot money ( more than purchase price ) this item expedited . it didn't show up time . however , company made good returning few shipping dollars , product what it , without " themes " you purchase stores . experience -- other than delay -- fine	1
we bought this our daughter christmas . she loves polly pockets . i liked it because it came guy animals . it even little seatbelts . top comes off you rock animals . doors click shut . you make sure seatbelt out way or it won't click . it great polly pocket addition our collection	1
this great game ! it lot fun , not just trivia like trivial pursuit . there word puzzles , analogies , wild cards could anything - 3 questions where you fill two blanks , guessing someone name , etc . it really great game , though probably better suited older age bracket , we tried play 11-year old , there just some words musical groups she didn't ( couldn't possibly expected ) know .	1
thing i like this game it trivia game everyone play . my hubbie hates trivial pursuit , but likes wit end , because , since lot it multiple choice , you chance getting answer even if you just guess	1
after reading all glowing reviews , i really excited this game . i very disappointed when i finally got game actually played it my family , however . there four categories question , but these categories differ how question asked , not subject question . it nice idea , different subject matter might make game interesting . majority questions seem involve history or dates one way or , however . if question music or film , example , it might involve placing placing releases order oldest most recent . current events questions might require player know which event occurred before certain date . someone who more interested why what than when , i found myself bored frustrated this game . i like learn something even when i get question wrong , but i found myself not caring much right answer question if all it involved knowing which obscure play written before wwii , etc . conclusion : if you're good history dates , you'll probably enjoy this game . otherwise you'll probably bored anxious game end .	1
this tracing type art toy nearly impossible use . reflective panels not securely attach if you just brush them your arm they fall down . there no integrated light toy so you need find very well lit space work . my 5 year old i extremely frustrated this toy returning it	-1
i just got this figure mail i say it really nice looking . i it up my mantle now it looks = even better out it packaging . it must kings , gretzky , nhl fans . id rate pose 10 out 10 , it when he got points record edmonton . this figure would get 5 stars if it wasn't assembly . you put wayne legs normally leg assembly easy but thios just horrific . it possible , but i use tons soap water just get legs , then it wasn't easy . but i think it definately worth it .	1
i love this little cottage . we got it my 18 month old she enjoys it everyday !! i love it more open than other pretend houses , so there plenty air circulation our hot humid weather while she playing . construction very durable , there enough space her friend , or doll play ! definitely don't think twice . free shipping bargain this !	1
we just gave this playhouse our daughter her second birthday , she absolutely loves it . if she spots it out window she starts crying go out play it , even when it bedtime . i love how i watch her playing afar , because how sides open , but she still two windows she open close . i also love how it solid floor . other playhouses i've seen , without floors , end up dead grass mud them . house roomy enough inside i join her there , she loves phone . even though she few different play phones play , i think she likes this one best because it most realistic . doorbell sounds so realistic , too . i researched lot different playhouses , different price ranges , i feel you truly get most your money this house . i'm not giving 5 stars because it wasn't completely easy my husband assemble . he said there some parts where instructions said drill straight , but really he drill angle make it secure . also , there some defective assembly parts , like screw flat , instead pointed , tip . house itself somewhat flimsy . when my daughter leans onto table it bend down some . but , so far it holding up , this price i really can't complain . just warning other parents ... when we tried buying this house stores early july it already deemed " out season " , we left either buy it online ( pay nearly $100 shipping ) , or travel hour away where we find one store . i learned my lesson always buy outdoor toys spring or early summer .	1
bought one because i liked idea light show ceiling . first one stopped turning first night lullaby music button didn't work like others wrote . returned it same thing !!! i say i like idea but this far most disappointing mobile we bought	-1
i would like ask others who purchased this mobile if they hear " buzzing " sound mobile rotates . it seems loud me i'm wondering if this normal or if i purchased defective one . also , i feel music too loud even lower volume selection . i even covered speaker muffle it it primary purpose put baby sleep not keep him/her awake .	1
i got this my little girl her second christmas . she played it christmas day once her room . balls hard her put hole top . she just started placing them slide ( not through top ) . she never used panio keys could not turn wheel . not much fun	1
my 5 year old 19 month old love this toy . it cute music learning stuff it , very colorful . it worth it	1
my 6 yr old son got this christmas present . it disgusting !! stuff sticky oozes out when it setting . it isn't very tasty either . my son liked gummies but there some kind drink we poured down drain . i put it up am hoping he forgets we it !! recipes not hard follow but pouring them into molds getting everything set up requires adult .	1
kids fun this , but goo very hard young kids mix without making mess . it starts set very quickly so its hard get enough out bowl into molds . it okay , but definately not worth $25 . my 6 year old just much fun playing cheap spices bowl water	1
mcfarlane toys only up series 3 cooperstown collection 6-inch action figures some baseball greatest stars yesterday , nolan ryan already up his second edition . his first figure part series 1 , showed him home uniform texas rangers , his left knee up his chest he got ready throw pitch ( presumably fastball high 90s ) . this figure shows all-time strikeout king road uniform california angels , following through pitch ( presumably fastball low 100s ) . so two figures you would long ( or tall ) short nolan ryan . ryan traded angels new york mets jim fregosi pitched eight seasons california , 1972 1979 . however , this figure would represent ryan 1975 or later because when angels started wearing red cleats you see this figure . too bad , because his best seasons angels 1973 , when he went 21-16 single-season record 383 strikeouts 2.87 era , 1974 , when he 22-16 , 367 strikeouts 2.89 era . he threw first two no-hitters 1973 his third 1974 , those also only two seasons ryan won over 20 games , which amazing when you consider he ends up over 300 wins . course , becomes easier when you pitch 27 seasons all i say whoever taught young pitchers mets farm system how strengthen their legs prolong their career fantastic job ryan ( 27 seasons age 46 ) , tom seaver ( 22 seasons age 41 ) jerry koosman ( 19 seasons age 42 ) . seaver or somebody must passed this information roger clemens . only reason ryan retired because age 46 he his first season ten years when he not average over strikeout inning . sculpt ryan face pretty good always attention details uniform great . figure limited articulation , but basically you want it look like what you see here . me key detail how relaxed ryan right hand looks now he released ball , like he just whipped ball somebody one his 5,714 strikeouts . he threw seven no-hitters ( this could not his 1974 no-hitter because he pitched home against baltimore orioles not road ) , 12 one-hitters . what new record ryan express i learn today ? he only pitcher strike out side nine pitches both leagues , not this surprises anyone . but you look his record you wonder what he would if he played better teams , because he career era 3.19 go all those strikeouts . nolan ryan last quarter 20th century what walter johnson first quarter : great pitcher despite teams not great . why he popular enough already his second cooperstown collection figure .	1
awful game . nothing like show . only way we could try make it work both teams answer each round just see who scored most points . they must pay people write some those 5 star reviews . i doubt my family ever play this game again . boring	-1
i am sure this must good program , however , i disappointed find it not pc program rather one tv . i am hoping i trade it pc program since my granddaughter i like play family feud when she visits . we older version but we wanted updated version	1

if there option pick " no stars " this item i would ! this got worst organizer made . top serving no purpose , toys us manufacturer not willing work me exchanging it something functional ! bins sit 2 wooden poles per rack . there no center support each rack therefore when you load bins ; they fall down onto rack below so . it very frustrating it only sits my son room collect dust until i throw it out this weekend ! i highly recommend avoiding this organizer manufacturer ! what waste money energy !	-1

this main thing my daughter wanted xmas . three months later i finally gathered everything up grocery bag took it back store because it just sat collecting dust . main reason we couldn't get it open . it took 2 days set date . then i figured since i could it would ok close it until we could work it some more . we tried tried use password but no luck . honestly i think they need take thing off market . it nice concept . i ended up getting her barbie dairy instead . much less stress much cheaper . i know there plenty people out there agree me i only wish i would listened you before i bought it .	-1

we this magnetic abc book year now . we take it out look together every few weeks or so . pieces all intact book fairly entertaining . my 2-year-old likes take all pieces out , one one , then he name pictures he puts them back correct positions . my opinion , illustrations just ok , but then , that not really point this product . my 2-year-old book fanatic sit " read " his books 45 minutes time , several times week . this not one his favorites , but every so often , he seems enjoy it . it something different anyway . i like " hands-on " approach this book provides . this would make great car or plane trip toy , provided you bring carry case all pieces . this quiet , educational , somewhat engaging requires no batteries	1

over years , i managed amass collection pretty much every version " password " ever produced . exception " super password , " i enjoyed every televised version show . " password " episode " odd couple " one my all time tv favorites . you may guessed , i like game . this dvd version , all intent purpose , just over-produced variation standard home version . instead cards holders , you get pair 3-d looking glasses . unfortunately , you easily read secret password screen without glasses . , computer generated host ( charmin ' chuck harmin ) just annoying host they could come up . endless games produced many good home games . dvd games , least going this one , not fit into their business model quite well . save yourself some money get their standard edition " password " game . it not high-tech . but it lot more fun	1
my son received this car his first birthday . time he not fine motor skills needed use keys etc fix car , but he loves push it floor watch it go crash when it bumped into things . it kept him busy kitchen evenings while i cooked . now it coming closer two year mile marker , he learning use keys refuel engine fix problems car when it breaks down . it just challenging enough him fun , it also dishes out rewards when he gets it righ t.t his toy very durable planning went into it fantastic . it just enough sounds keep him entertained but not annoying ! a+ our house	1

my baby girl absolutely loved this toy ! we gave it her when she 4 1/2 months old she immediately figured out spinner pull-hammer . my only complaint would now she too old beginner side but gets frustrated advanced side . but on/off switch big plus age all toys lights sounds it hooks onto siderail crib or sits her legs very easily	1
we've received this toy gift our friends i liked idea 2 sides ( like 2 new toys once ) . but then , when we tried playing it i didn't like several things : 1 ) side 1 - really hard squeak thing , - hard pull hammer - pretty far located smiley face so baby playing it activity table ( not crib mounted ) won't easily reach press it- smiley face could more than 1 melody playingit results side only 3 things play baby 6-8 months : spinning flower , spinning ball mirror2 ) side 2- most i don't like this toy ( both sides ) music those 4 musical instruments buttons . it sounds not like it baby toy but like it some kind tool horrify baby . we pretty much musical toys none them music which soooo unpleasant . my baby just looks tose buttons she looks strangers she doesn't like . - pop-up thing - could better holding door ( opens easily ) prettier " animal " inside . - squeaky knob this side hard push even me . summarize i'll just say me even 2 sides not worth money ! i don't like it all	1

its great because you study it figure out how it works , whose lightsaber it movies ( this case its qui-gon jinn blue ) fight it because its durable , all sorts stuff !! i love it !	1
i bought lightsaber like this one right before realease episode 3 . i also bought electronic color changing one which i thought would way cooler then basic lightsaber . putting it quite frankly i terribly mistaken . sure electronic lightsaber sounds changes color but u cant even see it daylight . plus basic lightsaber half cost electronic lightsaber . my friends i play woods every day our lightsabers . tell u truth i traded lightsaber changes color yugioh cards . only bad thing it not very educational . it however quite entertaining . i think worst thing if you drop lightsaber handle probaly get scratched or if u use them regularly blade may dented . overall very good i suggest u buy more wait until they make better electronic ones	1

we bought this christmas gift our son . what colossal waste money . he so dissappointed it so hard use ( even adult help ) . my husband re-solder wire connections before we could even use it once . we would better off buy strong magnifying glass prepared slides looking slides way . actually finding focusing slide image almost impossible due cheapness this product . it his " big " present turned out dud . we'd return it , but would blow santa cover	1
girls love all versions bratz . mom , i think bratz dolls look too mature their presumed ages . makeup way over top their clothing only compare " ladies night " . babyz underware only described thongs . however , finally kidz version improved upon . makeup still strong , but more acceptable . clothing closer what kid would wear overall look more innocent than other bratz dolls . if you've also found bratz dolls objectionable ( even though i still buy them ) , kidz version much more acceptable my 7 y.o. daughter seems like these better than any other version .	1
when i went into toys us today merely check new barbie clothes my pullip dolls , i no intention buying this lovely girl . i skimmed through bratz section just see what there . my companion pointed out yasmin kidz doll , i thought she very cute , but not my cup o ' tea . i searched cloe since she my favourite- * points cloe army * -and found her . i promptly fell love . her hair very pretty , it reminds me sun-kissed cloe hair , minus braids . her face very cute , i like her body proportions . clothes well made , she perfect size carrying around . i cannot recommend her enough ! if you like cloe , you should defidentely get this girl . -taff	1
i bought this set because my 5-year-old son begging thomas train set i cannot afford those prices ! so i took chance this one , i am thrilled ! roundhouse very high quality , almost identical thomas train one which sells $80 . set comes lots good quality wooden track ( no splinters or sharp edges , it all fits together fine ) , two bridges , turntable , two cranes easy operate , two trains , truck , two people , trees , signs . best all , you build exact display shown box still leftover track ! no disappointment ! my only complaint one little trains came it keeps losing wheel . not such big deal us , because we bought thomas train engines use instead ( yes , they fit track just fine ) . this set supposed compatible brio trains too , but we haven't tried those yet .	1
i bought this monopoly my husband , who loves video games . he adores it ! pieces spaces absolutely perfect any gamer	1
two classic games/companies brought together .. you can't go wrong . if you like monopoly nintendo , this seems like obvious pairing . cards cute clever . any monopoly game , it always seems games take forever , we still haven't gotten through full game . but i think key playing 4 or more order make it go more quickly .	1
this best toy box . it holds huge amount toys , my 18 month old no problems opening or closing it . it only took 20-30 minutes put together . i would definitly recommend it .	1
looking nice sturdy , wooden toy chest replace overflowing toy basket this perfect . quality wood great , design nice simple , assembly wasn't bad all . it took hour myself while hubby doing other things . size perfect our house safety latch nice security measure . my 3 year old loves rummage thru it her toys mommy loves fact toys aren't cluttered everywhere . i highly recommend it	1
we love this toy . we bought it cheer up my son who broke his arm , it certainly worked . $3.50 , we still laughing days later . it writes ! my kids writing their christmas cards this pen even my 3 yr old loves it . perfect stocking stuffer . kids all ages . :	1
i really expected more this product when reading description . within 15 minutes use , antennae fell off one . upon examining it , i discovered it decorative purposes only no useful purpose . we also hard time getting it function properly . my granddaughter , who loves stuff like this , rarely plays it . she wanted real walkie-talkie this one performs like " pretend " one .	1
i resisted buying these because they seemed so cheap ... also usual question we parents always ask ourselves ... " what they going them ? " my son received his first bionicle friend his ninth birthday ... it cleverly " bow " birthday present . i now regret overlooking this wonderful line " lego " so long ! my boys love these ! they best time building them even better time playing them . they priced reasonably so you always pick-up one treat during trips out " shopping " . if you encourage your children " save-up " some their " wants " , cost these low enough it doesn't take them months months realize their goal . please not make same mistake i made misjudge these toys . you denying your child great experience . although manufacturer suggests ages 7 up , i not feel child younger than 8 or 9 would able independently put this toy together . my 7 year old needs some help putting these together , but he loves try all himself . point lego , construct play . primary benefit , my opinion , satisfaction " doing it " yourself ! definate a+ our boys ! rosemary	1
my family enjoyed pirates movies so much we couldnt wait get this game . once we started playing it we very disappointed . it no excitement it . we thought it would clips movies but but it doesnt . it just moving ships around map collecting cards your treasure . it takes long time each turn since you put your coordinates your ship see if you found any treasure . we played it 2 hours still no where near ending game . prepared long game if you buy this product	1
first , i just love little people toys !! fisher price made great beginner dollhouse this toy ! my daughter received it her first birthday . she loves move people enjoys making sounds house . she still plays it occasionally 18 months . i definitely think this 1st dollhouse - it doesn't many pieces there aren't many rooms . this great 1-year old , but i purchased " my first dollhouse " my daughter christmas step up . so , if you're looking longevity , i'd look into other dollhouses fp makes . but , younger children , i'm sure you won't dissapointed this one	1
i originally bought urban myth over holidays , struck what promising concept game it promised . how wrong i . starters box deceiving ; age recommendation 12 over which couldn't further truth . this definitely not family game . box , cutesy picture tame questions posed back misleading say least . least 85% questions our first go fairly high morbidity/death factor ( including one wince-inducing question weather or not infant carcasses used mob drug cartel . mercifully , it myth . ) i'm no prude , would no problem topics game not made promises whole family could play . now i'll certainly investigate content before inviting kids come join us . , err- how i put this ? shape game pieces ... interesting . course , i noticed this right away but just chalked it up my dirty , dirty mind . but soon kids left room moment , somewhat conservative mother leaned into me whispered " it just me , or those game pieces look like male _________ ? " so , yeah , this game gets big thumbs down family friendly departmen t.t hat aside , i'm afraid i cannot recommend game adult players well . urban myth also fails board game ... far we could ascertain board only served one particular purpose fairly feeble one . ( goal actually collecting enough letter cards either spell ' truth ' or ' myth ' . ) otherwise , you just mindlessly navigate board until someone collects enough cards based solely questions . board almost entirely useless . finally , game worst crime missed educational opportunity . when you play trivial pursuit get true or false question , give you correct answer some additional information said answer back card . this game only dryly indicates tale ' truth ' or ' myth ' without any further information , like why it myth or why it truth or how it all got started urban legend begin . if there no facts back up either claim , then why should we believe answers ? i know there only so much space back game card , but some information would nice . what waste . hopefully someone out there take this great idea turn it into great game i know it could . common boardgame idea guys ! better . try harder .	1
bright colors little knobs perfect beginner puzzle solvers . price great deal too	1
my daughter got few these melissa doug peg puzzles christmas , she now 16 months old mastered all them now so i keep buying new ones , i love she loves sit down them , it so wonderful sit help her watch her learn ! i think these wonderful ! she gets so excited play her puzzles	1
my twin 2 year olds borrowed this puzzle library loved it . we borrowed many lights camera interaction puzzles possible . it helped hand-eye coordination , well image recognition . my only problem trying remove ink puzzle . we accidentally ruined puzzle during cleaning , but this companies customer service huge help took care our replacement needs . i can't say enough great things this company or its products	1
these lot fun , i bought them my pool , even pool people love them . i put them pool when friends come swim . only down side theny tend end up skimmer batteries wear out pretty fast . i would recommend them adults or kid	1
hi i am 11 i pool my backyard it just regular pool just swim hardly anything it accept well ..... just swim !!!! but then one day me , my mom , my dad , my brother all went toys us intertube because one we popped . then " rainbow reef fish " cought my eye . then i picked it up asked my mom dad if we could get it pool . they said yes we could but only if we payed it own money which i happened my money me my pocket day . so when we got home i got my bathing suit got fish i jumped right pool play it . i so excited !!! this great toy ! it especially fun go underwater goggles look it swim underneath water . i highly reccomend this toy . people who said it stopped working . just get new one it could fish . but it worth money	1
i bought it present someone who never one because her parents thought it waste money when it first came out	1
overall , this cute little set dress your child like superman w/o spending lots money . it comes vinyl cape , superman plastic chest emblem , plastic chain pull apart pretend like you're man steel . it probably fit average child up 6 or 7 years old . chest shield velcro straps top bottom stretch around child arm/shoulder area - so if your child particulary large , it may not comfortable wear this . vinyl cape attaches velcro neck . one velcro tabs fell off vinyl started rip ( underneath tab area ) very first day my son wore this . we took it back exchanged it one . even though cape doesn't seem extremely durable , i'd still recommend it fun accessory any little superman fan . one more thing ... i think cape superman shield would look better red instead reddish brown color they ended up using . i'm not sure how many kids would care too much color though !	1
i love this doll so my 2 year old my 5 year old . i couldn't get 2nd one before christmas just got hispanic version , which i think it cuter ( least computer ) than blonde caucasion baby . my daughters only speak spanish dora explorer , but this may help them - my 2 year old doesn't care which language she speaking , she seems know what she wants ! anyway - i would suggest this doll anyone ! i even like playing her !! lol :-) i agree not enough diapers too much food . right now we just " pretending " she eating , so we don't waste diapers . i'll give her a++ her hair thin , but her head dark , so you can't tell . not sure what blonde hair like	1
fact i could order game plus . fact it couldn't shipped me because i apo/fpo address made me mad . i send game my father , then him send it me . i trying order product gift friend . it given him month later rather than his birthday like i wanted . i'm assuming game okay because i give it him late . i don't understand why i order some games through amazon get them , but not other games same kind . this needs change .	1
my 3yr old watched cars innumerable times . his favorite part movie frank chasing mcqueen mater . this game it ! pieces small but more detailed than i expected . frank particular ok . game itself again better than i expected ( i very low expectations ) . you move around board , tipping ( collecting ) tractors way . you roll dice see how far go , one side dice causes frank wake up , move spot . he'll chase you back start if you're way . my 3yr old loves it . there numbers bottom tractors you're supposed add up . but thats too much work , we just count how many tractors there , or just roll dice try wake up frank ... or just play pieces	1
i three half year old son all he wanted christmas " mean tractor frank " . frank happens only vehicle they not make . this game it !!! out hundreds presents he recieved over last three days , little frank out this game his favorite toy world . oh he also likes play game . pieces extremely tiny . but my 2 year old also well them .	1
i'm huge fan leapfrog toys . but this one never clicked my twins . when they younger it took long accomplish each turn they got older , it just boring . every turn , game tells kids what , then they find letter card put it special slot . but there just so much talking singing going , kids get bored . they want game moves quickly this one doesn't it	1
we purchased this game my jus t-t urned 5-year-old . he loves play both levels . his almost 4-year-old friend enjoys limited play , 2-year-old loves just looking cards , calling out letters , playing plastic figures . couple letter sounds very similar , but it teaching alec listen carefully not get discouraged if he gets answer wrong first time . it also nice there no one " winner . " anyone who reaches " winners " square winner . my son sometimes just randomly calls out letters sounds they make . very good getting him ready school few months	1
she already knew how add subtract , but place value new concept her . boy , she learned it immediately , game so much fun her add cards you more addition/subtraction practice there well ! ;) she loves play this game , i really like concept bright colors . i just love it when learning fun children ! how it should , not dry or boring . your child love this game .	1
i wanted get my 20-month-old some fun but educational bath toys found market greatly lacking . i decided order these hoping they would solid plastic not hold water . i won't buy squirt type toys anymore my son because they impossible keep clean thrown away after few months . needless say , these squirt toys even though description says nothing it . i willing give toys benefit doubt because i really liked shape matching features my son stage where he loves matching shapes , colors , etc . i took them out mesh bag , which great bath toys though they could included suction cup hanging it up , i realized plastic some turtles extremely flimsy . when my son tries match shells turtles , body turtles just cave he can't get it . not all turtles this way , but most them . i regret wasting my money these . what rip off ! avoid all costs ! if you're looking fun , open-ended yet affordable tub toy , try tub stickers alex . there bunch varieties , they super easy clean come mesh bag suction cups hang up your bath or shower drip dry . my toddler loves them	1
i gave this my nephew his first birthday he my other nephew ( 4 years old ) love it ! it huge hit their favorite gift . i like it because it gives them hours play it folds up easily stored	1

my son only asked this christmas , so i get it . it doesn't much -- he bored it within few days . it shoots harmless " bullets " pretty far , but not easily aimed . pincher our first one didn't work so we send it back replacement . pincher still isn't very strong basically just pushes things around rather than carry them -- it doesn't " lift " objects , just grabs them drags them around -- you hold button continuously hold object . loud -- very loud -- legs hit floor very hard ( though i haven't noticed any scratches floor ) . we small house you hear bug one end other . i would not buy this again . there much more interactive rc toys out there	-1
i got this game play 5 other people during spring break , we definitely all good time playing it . we split into two teams , guys vs . girls . it wasn't stupid hard like " friends scene it " version . it little challenging , but we definitely knew lot answers . without doubt great party game . if you've got lot people both guys girls , you can't go wrong playing this ! this my first board game review , but i give it 4 stars .	1

i love leap pad , but there catch . we've bought 3 pads ( first one broke almost immediately ) , we've owned 10 different books . those 10 , only 3 still work . one got wet . several placed toy boxes or kicked under beds . once these books dropped few times , or buried under toys , they cease work correctly ( if all ) . they only cardboard , after all . children who get most benefit fun these toys young - say kindergarten through 3rd grade . older kids going less satisfied format , probably happier working actual computer . leap pad particularly great long car trips , but make sure little game cartridges don't go missing . also , wire connecting stylus pad become caught when pad shut - once wire ruined pad ruined too . i said , i think leap pad items great . they help child reading , spelling , basic math - all fun stress-free venue . but these books easily ruined little ones . your best bet may keep leap pad books pad out reach kids when you can't there supervise , so you oversee care handling books pad . leap pad good value , but only if you make it last while	1
this game easy play adapted different ages . it fun see 4 year olds strategize	1
this item looks ok , but website completely misleading saying it ships within 24 hours . i ordered this nov . 27th not receive it til dec . 8th . that nearly 2 weeks . it may not worth ordering online even free shipping , better fight crowds stores	1
well when we purchased this toy we read reviews here expected treads come off all time . well , lo behold our version terence doesn't this . they've redesigned him treads not come off . he fits track but not roll like other trains . pressure applied his wheels turn but he no way roll down hill his own . you could cut treads but wheels don't appear right size . sometimes treads get off their wheel grooves bit they seem like they may stretch out . our son still loves " terdence " but i would almost prefer old style so we could remove treads he would roll freely . messes up track too if it not secure . store both versions i now know may buy other one . difficult make everyone happy i realize , dad probably more concerned it than his son :	-1

black pearl playset absolutely worth money . my 6 year old daughter who loves capt . jack received this other mega block sets series . i ended up putting it together her while she entertained her grand parents . instructions really well . each step pictured simple understand notations large images . each piece fits like any other mega blocks or lego-type project . you just got make sure you press pieces together hard surface get them really lock well ( carpet building especially hard when attempting port royal playset . lol)it took me hour get black pearl together . this only because there so much going around me while i working . :-) yes , ship come apart while you playing it . my daughter didn't rip it half or anything - just part side pushed back . isn't part fun pirate ship battle two ships blowing holes into each other their cannons ? anyway , i've never known lego-type toy not come undone unless you permanently model glue them strategic places . i think i'll probably end up doing this ship . it quite pretty - you say pirate ship ?! lol - well detailed . figures really cool , too . each their little arms , legs , heads posable . all all , yes , i recommend this toy . i'm tempted buy keep it save decked out shelf . :-)	1

i agree many other reviewers this bike tips over very easily . my son know how pedal bike , yet this tips without any warning . he gotten caught underneath bike , handlebars turn so he needed help get bike off him so he could get up . only positive aspects we store ours outside it held up well , also , my son able reach pedals before he turned 2 ( he lttle under 50% height ) so he able learn pedal this bike . side note , 2 most positive reviews this bike over 18 months old , i think it quite possible they different model than what currently available	1
i bought original when my kids 5 3 , it good game them play together change . dvd game same concept , but more visual ; when announcer announces pad , possibilities show up screen . all pads animals ( no food , musical instruments , original ) , but there minimal animal education . kids might learn which animals farm animals , which ocean animals , etc . i think there less variation this game than original ; after few days play repeat games , i figure out ( but not my kids)which pad winning one . one best features original , it made my kids listen instructions . listening skills replaced visual cues dvd version .	1
i bought this doll my 4 year old because she saw this store really cried it . like previous reviews , it very loud annoying . also ballet skirt would not stay unless you held it down which hard when doll twirling around . my daughter rarely looked this doll past first day . i eventually gave it my neice but my sister brought it back next day complaining how loud annoying it . i finally took it salvation army .	1

my son ( 4-1/2 ) given this christmas gift it hands-down winner best toy household . we two other " marble run " toys - one made wood blocks other plastic - this far most creative , versatile exciting use . each color-coded blocks something little different , which makes endless variations building runs . " twist rail " set excellent starter since it such large variety pieces . there several layouts included pamphlet step-by-step illustrations our son follow himself . it takes us parents little playing remember what each color piece ; so it fun challenge young old alike . we can't wait add onto this set !! this heirloom-quality toy played many , many hours fun all us . it very sturdy well-designed . if you think terms money spent per hours play , this sound investment	1
this also my first review ever - but i felt compelled given our enthusiasm over this toy . we gave this set our son this christmas - he five next month - he whole family love it ! quality excellent well worth higher cost ( compared more inexpensive plastic runs ) . so far , my son wanted me build runs , but i know his confidence grows toy he take off into building his own . getting many marbles we , quickly we , going down run just flat out addictive fun ! we felt this great set start since ( reviewer said ) it comes both curved straight rails spiral teeter-totter . i'm already looking forward buying some accessory add-on sets my son birthday other holidays ! i'm sure we going get years enjoyment out this toy . i highly recommend it	1
my daughters fight over this thing all time 3 songs get annoying real quick but they all great time it ! microphone headset pretty much useless , doesn't fit any my kids properly ( ages 2 , 4 6 ) . it seems like it pretty well made andhas held up some mild abuse so far	1

i recently purchased this outdoor playhouse my 21-month-old daughter . i found product online , but able get it toys us price online ( i didn't pay shipping ) . overall , it great toy . seems big enough 2 children play inside together , but there other things outside around playhouse if there more than 2 children . one downside entrance into playhouse . porch leads into house but not level ground leaves step down which children easily trip over . my daughter stumbled first time she entered house , but now aware she needs watch her step . my daughter loves skylight , mail slot , doorbell , phone ... all big crowd pleasers . front bench very fun sturdy . there could more play inside house , but i guess what imaginations . only reason this playhouse not get 5 stars because safety issue front porch leading into house . manufacturers could thought idea out bit better	1
my 3 daughters just love it . it came quickly it wonderfull price which makes it nice around holidays . thanks muc	1

playmobil pirates sets perfect young children vivid imaginations . this my 4 year old favorite toy . we spend countless hours sailing high seas together . he selected ' skeleton ' pirate island set his own personae we call him captain bones . ship very well made withstood many dramatic battles against " bad pirates " . details what he most enjoys , like treasure , swords , goblets , lamps other small items come these sets . whenever i chase down captain bones shark figure , trying take bite his boney leg , my son laughs joy . makes this set my favorite toy well : most time i am watching him smiles rather than pirate my son assigned me . you get months months use out this set	1
i rather alarmed parent stated their child goes around dressed like prostitute . where parent ? who control ? sounds like this parent needs some therapy . i'm tired hearing people blame others or things mishaps happening their own backyard blaming it someone else . stop ! get some therapy . if you raise your child morals values , they good root thrive . if you don't , they grow uncontrolled . if you're trouble your little one right now , get some personal help so you obtain control ~ before she 16 pregnant , running away , or doing drugs . i've bought my 8 year old bratz dolls since they came out . she never asked dress like one . she around 50 these dolls . she plays them , but more interested discovery channel , reading , making all a , worshiping jesus . she straight student loves draw play piano . i not say i'm perfect , but i spend lot time my little one . i talk her dangers strangers what emergency situation . her dad takes her fishing i'm certified swim instructor ~ so i've taught her safety swim lessons . if you spend lot time your children , they idolize you .... not tv , not music they hear , not plastic dolls ..... but reality . yours truly , east texas	1

this toy seems hold my 4 yr old intertest well , but it not very durable all . it kept falling apart so i actually bought some model glue glued all parts together . now you can't open it up , but i no longer teary eyed little girl coming me pieces her hands .	-1
stop ! this may look cute , but any amount playing ( even breathing it ) cause it fall apart . this toy not last month our house . it never stayed together , top it comes 20 teeny tine " grooming pieces " ( not kidding , most smaller than dime ) definitely major disappointment my daughters who love strawberry shortcake horses	-1
toy trumpet beautifully made . my granddaughter happy it , however there no instruction how play different songs . there four colored buttons trumpet but no songs play we can't seem contact company who makes it	1
gamewright this way taking old standard- this case slapjack- adding couple minor improvements , turning it into something seems so much more . my 5 year old daughter loves this . i would reccommend this 5-7 year olds ... not so much older kids . i think beyond certain age this game lose little it luster ( gamewright masters grabbing kids ' attentions fun visuals ) certainly any developmental benefit .	1
well i bought this my mother-in-law who hooked su doku . i bought it just small token . price cheap i thought why not ? well it hard see screen . it also bit impractical if you realise you got number wrong 20 turns ago , you go delete all 20 turns you just spent time doing get it amend i t.t he price cheap , so i not expecting anything fancy but honest i disappointed it . when i realise i gotten number wrong i not bother trying find it , i just start new game . but fact so hard see screen find curser very annoying fact no one even bothers using it now . we just print out sheets web it old fashoned way pen paper clipboard . i said , no harm , it cheap thing anyhow	-1
it fun addictive game , but this hand held version little difficult control doesn't always sense when u push buttons	1

my 7 6 year old love their new game , mind wars junior . it like trivial pursuit different subject areas , like language , math , physical science , life science social studies ... give you idea , it questions dealing various subjects , like christopher columbus , gases , elements , antartica , martin luther king jr. lots more .... my kids didn't want stop playing it very easy hook up , all you plug it your system set board leap pad , turn it play ... it very easy understand they even repeat button , volume control game , all kids , go around many spaces game tells them after they push button , then they answer various questions , first one close all 5 subject windows wins ! there multiple choice , also true false questions ... lots fun ! :) very happy this item ! keep up awesome work leap frog ! i loved watching them play ... i give this definate 5 star rating ! next , i get one older kids .... 3rd grade up ...	1
i debating whether or not get deluxe or original i saw this review [ ... ] . " game excellent , but unless there some reason you cannot deal smaller pieces standard version , there no real reason get deluxe . " so if you same question , this may help .	1
this dog very large ty animal . fur extremely soft . very good product sale price	1
other reviewer fine job summarizing many features this game cartridge . what they didn't mention graphics terrible . pixelation so bad if you didn't already know engines you might not able recognize them . [ example , there station labeled tidmouth * something * . neither my husband nor myself make out what second word . ] said , knowing how thomas fans , nothing we've said keep you purchasing this cartridge because your child , like my 3.5 year-old son , probably like it regardless how lame it . so let me tell you more ... there four areas : learning zone , learning adventure , engine depot options ( music or off ) . * learning adventure * area you help thomas rest steamies their jobs . children supposed learn letters , object identification , colors counting . [ four games four subjects . ] general , all games require joystick . most games some sort obstacles , but easy level hitting obstacles doesn't end play . * learning adventure * zone : calling all engines - drive thomas pickup letters spell name . ---- bonus game - drive through cave collect coins before you time outflying rescue - fly harold hospital other locations using map upper left hand corner figure out where you . ( object identification)cargo catch-up - fly harold drop cargo into freight cars same colorbertie beats clock - bertie needs get children various stations . when station , you supposed count children getting off . ---- also this section `take break ' - counting/matching/odd one out*learning * zone : * learning zone * there four games which focus different skills . children supposed able learn size sorting , classification , counting puzzles . size sorting - use percy sort minerals into correct sized freight cars ( big boulders go into big trucks ; small rocks go into small cars)recycle challenge -troublesome trucks nearly full recycled items . you need grab same type item hook move it right car . count engines - count while engines pass byfix tracks - thomas coming tracks `not right ' . using joystick you rotate through variety track options . some tracks too big , others small or just not correct . when correct tract appears push big orange button confirm . * engine depot*in * engine depot * area ( rather lame ) you read thomas friends profiles . you also blow their whistles or berties case , blow his horn . gaming area you choose easy difficult options . example learning adventure area , game 1 (`calling all engines ' ) easy setting children find 3 engines collect letters tracks spell name engine ( such `toby ' ) . difficult level they still find 3 engines , but this time letters long name ( such `edward ' ) . we just opened game so i can't tell you too much more action game play , except my son daughter ( husband-lol ) seems very interested . four stars . old fashion ( read poor graphics ) . true thomas fan probably not care they get `drive ' thomas his friends ( including harold ) around sodor . age range , many these games beyond abilities -physically intellectually-of 3 year old [ map reading comes later ]; but should allow them `grow ' into game latter point	1
i bought this item my mom ( her early 50s ) she loves it ! she non-stop crossword puzzler just raves this product . she never search book lean , or pencil sharpener !! she always puzzle handy work ! puzzles range easy ( not silly easy ! ) hard ( good challenge ! )must	1
jack sparrow ring incredibly high quality . it not look like toy or cosmetic jewelry . it sturdily made detail surprising . green " gem " not look exactly like emerald , but overall this item probably one best deals price you find anywhere !	1

i say if i it over again , i never would let my son see fisher price catalog pick his christmas present . he saw shake go racetrack wanted it mater lightening mcqueen cars immediately . i am not so happy it because it takes lot keep race going . cars don't go more than 3-4 turns around race track before they shaken again then time race over , your wrist hurts . my son only 3 he doesn't know shake it enough so him , it just not fun . he likes it but easily gets discouraged it when he can't make cars go more than one lap , if . i would not recommend this 3-5 yr . olds . maybe older kids , but i wouldn't buy it again . i wish i could get my money back , but box all it wrappings went out christmas wrap trash . not waste your money	-1
we received this our baby shower set it up when danica 4 weeks old . first she would just stare toys . one day she reached them . day she touched one . day she grabbed it . one day she got music sound . one day she tall enough touch toys kick ball same time . it so exciting watching her development this toy . after she could sit up , she loved ripping toys off their velcro . when she started crawling , she would take ball off carry it around her hand . she now walking she uses this her private cabana . i give her snack she sneaks away this ( set crawl position ) . i've uploaded picture her sitting it up-side-down like boat , watching backyardigans , so check above . she loves sitting it when it turned like this . i promised this toy so many people , thinking she outgrow it soon . she turns year next week she shows no signs getting bored it . she found new , quite unexpected , way play it . it grown her well beyond my imagination . she outgrown her crib , her walker , her exersaucer , her bouncy chair . this toy outlasted them all	1
my baby loves this toy , however , afer couple weeks she can't play it anymore , because we don't triangular screwdriver change batteries octopus makes music when baby hits or touches it . this toy fantastic , my baby loves it so much up until it died !!! i think fisher-price/mattel should include tool change battery , otherwise , i would render this toy completely useless	1

we bought this our 2 year old son christmas gift . we can't wait see look his face few days . it very solid construction should stand up years use . walls different shapes/objects molded into them , some it quite detailed , but it all same color . so my wife i purchased some plastic paints local craft store painted some objects walls add more detail realism . it cheap easy , results speak themselves . we painted fruit store wall , atm etc . inside my wife painted globe , books , tools hanging wall , bank safe tire . it looks very cool now . this house doesn't any sound effects or lighting , so i purchased wireless doorbell battery operated light home depot . total cost paints electronincs $25 easy . rather than spending extra $100 more detail electronics , this very cost effective fun way make house even better . i think my son going love it . i'll post pictures when i get time .	1
i purchased this case store my son little touch leap pad books cartridges but they not fit . case much bigger than i thought it would but it still not fit little touch leap pad itself there . my son just got my first leap pad christmas this one fit there . i am glad we found use it or i would sending it back refund . make sure you know which system you using it before purchasing make sure it fit	1
why i wait so long ? after months leap pad books their cartridges floating all over my son bedroom floor ~ finally they all home . this handy little storage system hold most children leap pad library books cartridges . it certainly hold enough keep your child happy quite while . this perfect drag adventure . price what kept me buying storage container when i bought system . silly ~ since i so much more invested system its books . i finally took plunge couldn't happier . now when we dash off adventure ~ everything ready go . it also great tool encourage your child put everything away when they playing it	1

if you're looking way organize your puzzles , this it ! great job , kids pretty well getting them in/out . i wish there way adjust sizes racks , but i haven't seen anything like	1
puzzle rack great theory ................... concept this awesome , but unfortunately my 18 1/2 month old liked dump it out all puzzles it throw it ............... you probably know , this age most kids dump everything , so i am sure i am not alone here ............. some sharp edges , also not appropriate this age . like i said , theory it great which why i didn't return it , i just put it away closet couple months until i think she get concept no longer dump it .................. still recommend it	1
this non-toxic markers paint washable . crayons watercolors certified cp markers pencils certified ap . clean clothing might watercolor paint , it advised not use pre-wash or chlorine bleach . this should also kept away wallpaper , painted walls , finished unfinished wood vinyl . my son this time he four seven liked it but prefer his magna doodle over it . set up easy all pieces fitting into each other slots . order use easel correctly two purple trays must situated just right red container . this work two ways because if you not want use green stand you move trays out bit turn around then slide paper under clip start drawing , painting or coloring . clip also removable easy snap into place . when you storing this you place clip paper supplies under trays . we paint stains many spots , but they easy remove cloth or wipe . use stand you would lift up red blue sections place stand slots provided . two purple trays removed before doing this supplies close hand not turn this around over . both purple trays small section watercolor tray . when easel used there small groove hold two markers one pencil . trays even slide upside down . one down fall this if you using it portable reasons it gets loud items moving there .	1
excellent strategy game . moves , including just rotation peice , van serious consequences . various configuration starting positions keep any single strategy consistently successful . just started using it my son ( age 7 ) i anxious continue experimenting . no doubt " cool factor " laser game some effect his enthusiasm , but he learning strategy well . company also quickly replaced defective game without any problems . highly recommende	1
i got this game my birthday ( i'm 35 ) i love it ! it like high-tech version chess . definitely makes you think hard try plot out your moves many steps advance . it especially tricky because you simultaneously think offensively defensively . if you like classic strategic boardgames , you'll love this game	1
this bucket lego blocks great creative tool . pieces varied sizes shapes which jumpstart imagination . set definitely helps develop fine motor skills smaller pieces require little hands work diligently . one word caution . if your goal build houses or any other kinds buildings , you need purchase bucket legos purpose . this set not contain enough actual building bricks job , but this bucket legos would make great addition such set	1
people saying they don't like this doll because she too much makeup her outfit looks goth . 1 . why you looking this doll if you problem what she looks like ? 2 . she supposed look goth , duh ! 3 . i think she cool i'm buying her .	1

this great bike . i ride it all time my 5 year olds twins ... who just starting able ride it . i found nothing better than this bike . it brakes which nice our hilly driveway . kettrike sloopy nice but it doesn't brakes . it surprising more products aren't made 5-10 year olds these days . pretty much anyone who not fat ride this trike	1
i read lot reviews it seems largest complaint , if any , regarding leaking plugs . well , table bryce got his 1st b-day ( 4/11/07 ) no plugs it , so i guess step2 figured out it better no plugs avoid leaks . i'd agree . we set this up house because it too cold outside . bryce loads fun ! only improvement i'd make this point wheel tower attach table . reviewer mentioned , tower tips over very easily typically first thing get thrown . i'm sure it broken before summer over because this . i intended give it only 4 stars because this , but submitted review too quickly . oh well ! other reviewers wanted lid table because they're worried debris when outside . it takes 1 minute tip over , pour out old water , spray out hose , fill back up . i personally know i'd more diligent doing this than stopping put lid back after play over . all , great investment kids who love splash !	1
my son 20 mths old loves this water table . he so excited get it . only thing , he thinks it pool wants crawl it .. haha ... needless say , since it only got 3 legs , it not sturdy toddlers wanting crawl into it . but other than , great toy	1
this great fun summer time . i purchased one my daughter one her cousin . they love it it provides loads entertainment holds up pretty well elements .	1
i like this coffee maker . it makes coffee pretty fast . one thing against it spout small you need pour very slow or it pour over sides . after first two cups it becomes alot easier pour . i would buy same one again . it nice looking coffee maker	1
my 5-year-old 8-year-old love this game . i took it church function one day later kids there begged me bring it back again ! it says ages 6-9 , but i think real age range much broader . i bought extra keep hand last-minute birthday gift ! buy " lunchbox " version , though , because it hard get cards back into little paper box storage	1
my sister gave this my 15 month old daughter last christmas . soon i saw it , i knew she would love it i right . others mentioned , chair back issue , but our pops right back . chair also " tub " my daughter pretends pooh bed covers him his " towel " she calls his blankie . she takes duck bathtub her . she almost two now i would recommend this toy	1
i think it important give this kids right age . i bought book fingerpaints my son when he 2 , he not interested . but , he not interested any drawing/painting general . he 3.5 now , he just found he old book digging through his stuff , he amazed it - he finished it one evening . he still doesn't like coloring crayons - this requires too much patience - but paints different story . fingerpaints especially interesting him because element surprise - they all white but appear color paper , delay color apperance , while irritating first , now cool . yes , paints bit messy . no color , but they stay face , clothes , ect ., so again , make sure your child not too young , understands where paint should go	1
finally paint set where i don't worry spills or messes ! my kids thrilled receive this " santa " christmas . they love paint but i always discouraged it house . ( we galley kitchen , carpet dining room . worried carpet . ) well no longer ! they loved able paint it kept them occupied least 20 minutes , i didn't hover over them . i admit my youngest daughter dig into her paint , it all gone . but she learning use it correctly her older sister . i know we buying more future more fun !	1
good part : this thing fly high , soar currents , lot fun once you get hang it . i would recommend it someone least some experience ! controls touchy it spiral ground if you hold too long . it pretty tough take some hard hits without damage . bad part : i only got eight good charges out eight aa batteries am experimenting charging 12v mower battery . rechargeable aa ( " pure energy " ) available canadian company . great plane kids little bi-plane " air hog " . it practically bulletproof , easy fly , doesn't eat up batteries	1
i am avid r/c enthusiast - i couldn't wait try this toy see if it really flew ! so here scoop .... 1 ) there should almost no wind present if you want any chance successful flight - resist temptation fly gusty or strong winds . 2 ) right left controls very sensistive - turn requires one second control input - any more than turn become massive spiral - it looks cool - but you may only get one chance see it ! 3 ) fly large open area .. bottom line - very cool toy - it fly , fact it looks very cool flight . it very quick plane like this . if you low wind , go easy controls big area fly it you should blast - if not , choose something else so your not disappointed	1
i shopped extensively amazon best price . wagon assembled which easy . husband didn't swear actually commented quality hardwoods flush mounted screws . i thought i would use additional water sealant but wagon nicely finished . oh , one other thing standard baby bassinet mattress fits beautifully some padding . handle longer than generation ago , my 6'1 " husband comfortable pulling wagon	1
i received this wagon christmas 23 years ago , little refurbishing my son . my sisters i played our wagons all time kids --- hauling each other , dirt , dolls , neighbors-etc . all over neigborhood . mine played but great condition until 3 years ago when my older sister left it out rain few months ! ( her kids played them left them out ) whole inside wood panel warped beyond repair it developed some rust here there rained repeatedly . our dad really mad -- because he paid good money wagons ( we each one , 3 all -- yes , she left them all out rain ) so i decided refurbish it . i took it apart , sanded it , repainted red panels , stained sealed wood , repainted black metal decided switch tires out air tires similar those atw wagon . i also replaced wood panel you sit inside -- so basically all parts original except tires wood panel seat . it looks new again my son loves it ! it cost 20$ repair ( wood , paint , stain ) tires optional since there nothing wrong originals . well worth putting work into -- i still great wagon ! if you take care this wagon don't leave it out elements it last you long time ! ( i said , until 3 years ago it like new ) we also purchased pads -- love them	1
this great polly lovers . my little girl loves this . it wasn't all hard put together .	1
like others mentioned this not sturdiest toys . you must place it solid level surface , otherwise it wobbles pieces disconnect/fall apart . parents perspective , i am greatly disappointed overall quality . this obviously not well thought out . it designed easily broken down storage . unfortunately ... too easily , playing it sometimes troublesome , especially when little hands trying deal small space scale polly pocket toys demand . said , my daughter loves it not stopped playing it two days now . child gets bored single toy quite easily , ringing endorsement not put fully into words . best recommendation ... if you going buy this , wait sale	-1
packaging this product unacceptable . first table i received completely beat up/busted every corner . i sent it back only recieve second one same condition ... poorly packaged damaged beyond use . i didn't even take it out box ... damage visible through broken packaging everywhere . price free shipping catch , but it game see what you'll get . i guess this why they $49.99 . you're lucky if you get one you use . i not lucky	-1
you get this game your leapster , if you don't one yet , get whole system ! it just awesome ! my five-year-old loves , loves , loves this game . although it meant 4th graders , he no problems math questions which all answered prior going next level . it all batman villans - joker , mr. freeze , cluemaster , etc . math questions get harder higher levels i passed out when my five-year-old learning scalene triangles dimensions isosoles triangle breezing through it like it nothing . then , my husband gets ahold it just cannot put it down . all this say this very , very addictive they should put warning label ! this great son dad game play too , especially when it projected onto television leapster l-max . if you know someone who hates math , all means buy this game . it certainly erase all provide very , very enjoyable learning experience well . you just can't get better toy or better learning tool . praise god leapfrog . we've buying their stuff since my son born everything so wonderful . this absolutely far one best inventions yet learning . absolutely unbelievable . love this game i highly recommend it !	1
we advanced 6 year old who loves this game . she no tomboy , but rather " barbie " girl . i reluctant getting this her , but it turns out she adores playing it . we got this game her l-max .	1
we love brio train set , process collecting brio set each our sons birthdays christmas ' . wood soft enough so child rough it toss it around it may get dented , but doesnt break . only negative this particular set plastic scenery pieces dont seem stand well wooden stands . other than , we loyal brio buyers because you collect your hearts content always know they mix match other sets	1
i got this my son who just turned 5 years old time . first , he scared it not want it his room , but after he discovered how you use tools extract various guts organs , he loved it !.. we both take turns drawing it . drawings come off completely when washed . this really sparked creativity my son . i highly recommend it	1
i purchased this toy gift my 5 year-old nephew it big hit . he received many other gifts but open this one right away start playing it . he 2 other children spent quite while drawing it toghether ... all boys . it nice it something they could play together . i purchased toy not realizing you could open head pull out brain chest pull out heart ect . i initially not too comfortable this feature toy . however , when boys played it , they initially laughed parts then paid little attention them . these parts not very realistic looking good quick chuckle . my nephew continues play it frequently it washes well . i suggested it few other people young boys	1
i purchased this item my 4 , almost 5 year old . it way over his head ... not surprisingly it almost over mine . stated review , this looks more like rescue vehicle than firetruck ... also ... multiple pieces come this toy make it much more advanced toy ... not really 3 year old . manufacter recommended age 36 months 8 years . i would say more like 6 8 years no less . i almost feel like it collectors item should sitting shelf ... so you don't lose it parts ... but i not think manufactuer intended it so . unless your child perfectionist super detailed ... this really isn't toy them ( my opinion , course )	1
set comes nice box - important if you considering gift giving . looks very nice box . pieces same somewhat brittle plastic always used toy swords . they not stand up hacking rock instance , but they fine waving around like crazy . they hard enough really hurt if your two year old gets ahold one starts slashing . five year old i purchased these however , they perfect . two different sizes swords then protective gear make it nice set . helmet too small children much older than five but weapons look good enoght entice slightly older kids . glad i bought it , would worth it even original $12.00 price	1
these blocks looked better picture . they made cardboard fairly insubstantial money .	1
just what i looking sleeping bag built-in air mattress . great camping or sleepovers . well made good deal	1
if there 0 stars , that what it would get . my kid insisted buying this crap . i said it okay , hoping she wouldn't eat it . then she cooked it her easy bake .. very excited it .. i absoloutly refused let her eat it . it gross . smell revolting . she ate it anyway nearly threw up . thanks but .. gross .	-1
i think this one greatest ride-ons younger toddler ! i bought this my 18 month old daughter she absolutely loves it ! yes , it doesn't reverse , but my opinion , this ride-on more " first " training ride-on . i don't want my daughter learning how flip switch reverse 18 months ! she loves go around back yard it she hasn't gotten stuck once . i give it 5 stars !!!	1
we got this set our 5 year-old after he requested similar set cost $99 playmobil ! only $25 , this bargain ! it very sturdy ( we not any problems pieces falling off/apart or pieces not fitting properly - it simple snap-together process get pieces ) . there several cool features - although , others mentioned , there no " friend/foe " recognition feature fortress only " eagle " thing we could find small black bird looked more like crow/raven . we lots luck imaginext line products - we also pirate ship , which we purchased last year . sets come lots fun " extras " , like trap doors things move , open , close , etc . these allow lots imaginative play your children . my son also loves he rearrange pieces put castle or pirate ship together way he wants - he rearranges them all time he no problem getting pieces together them stay ( again , he 5 ) , so it really easy put together . i gave this medium score educational value it great imaginative play learning cause/effect , but there really no " academic " features . still , it great toy hours fun our home we would recommend this or any other imaginext set anyone ! price , i cannot imagine getting anything better , or anything could even come close	1
we got this castle our 5-year-old son , last christmas . it pretty cool . one problem , though , it seemed , it must assembled one spot kept there . if you move it , it'll likely fall apart . 5 , our son really didn't play it much . however , this fall , he begun really spend time it . first , fact it fell apart so easily after assembly frustrating him . now , it major benefit . he doesn't go " rules " . he put it together whichever way he wants . he become very creative it -- even designing constructing new additions it his own . when you're buying christmas , it'd fun get them everything their list -- but not very appropriate . we try choose things their durability their ability let our children create use their own imaginations -- rather than tv or computer or video games doing things them . this castle great purchase . we got thrill when we saw him start playing it extensively again -- year after he got it . that kind toy i want my house .	1
my son 7 yrs old we like this lot . it interactive ( batman voice , " tell me secret code " , " access granted/denied " , " tell me secret code again " , etc . ) inside secret drawers . you program number pattern open it , or use voice recognition . we difficulty getting it recognize his voice but it still very fun . he ends up opening it numbers instead . there hidden reset button if you forget password , or want change your voice	1

we bought this puzzle our daughter first birthday - hoping counter some noisier toys we suspected she would recieve ( she ) . our great pleasure it well-recieved , something she enjoys tinkering whilst making her rounds toys . pieces large - unlike so many first puzzles - made out thick , sturdy plywood . they painted non-toxic paints , rather than layer paper like many other puzzles which so quickly become soggy unusable first time they find their way into mouth . only downside pieces slightly rough edges - i think i may end up taking piece sandpaper them some point just smooth them out bit . , other reviewer noted , this cause difficulty getting pieces . despite this minor flaw this excellent learning tool young toddlers , i highly recommend it	1

my 6 year old loves underwater animals this beautiful puzzles captures them all . both my 6 4 year old making this puzzle year they love making it over over . it nice big , strong pieces won't bend easily .	1
my two girls ( aged 4.5 3 ) love puzzles . they different likes dislikes so we our house " my puzzles " " your puzzles . " but this one first " our puzzle . " it challenging enough both girls work together -- one tropical fish other dolphins , example -- what joy when patches would come together . different areas puzzle would take different hue blue ( ocean goes deeper color darkens , course ) , so girls sort out pieces start different " foci " floor . therefore this puzzle really helps them learn multi-tasking , organization , team work . it definitely step forward 24-piece or 50-piece sets , while still remaining manageable preschoolers . my only minor , minor complaint one stretch puzzle ( sperm whale area ) dark , bit simplistic design , somehow not preferred either girls -- so i would always assigned complete portion ; just little warning you may find yourself putting together giant sperm whale couple times day . bonus -- chart teaches children names all sea creatures puzzle	1
our 3+ toddler loves cinderella , so this under tree this past christmas . though fancy shoes fell off immediately ( i hid them since they pose choking hazard our 2 year old ) doll withstood tough toddler test time since december . press small button her back , dress sparkle light up while playing song , dream wish your heart makes " ( quite loudly i must add) ! doll beautiful likeness beloved disney princess , but her hair so stiff it doesn't welcome children play it , dress not come off , no-no little ones , since wand pointy piece plastic , it went way shoes avoid poking and/or choking hazard . though box states ages 3 up , i'd recommend this one more 5+ even more so doll collector since dress so unique well made . it comes pretty box too . overall really nice doll	1
my 4 year old daughter huge princess fan , loves cinderella . so when we got full size carriage , we got twinkle lights cinderella doll too . but she not very popular my daughter , because you can't change her clothes . since her dress wired light up twinkle when you press button , it stay her . so if your child like mine loves change her dolls ' outfits , this doll won't played too much	1

these baseplates important if your little one likes build structures legos . i'd recommend attaching them board ( i wood-glued 6 them board , added some molding , put sliders underneath so i could store board under beds or sofas ) so they won't flex . otherwise , you'll definitely need encourage your child play these table or other hard surface , warn them moving their constructions spot might result creations coming apart	1
this comment response completely irrelevant post tiffkilner ; perhaps she should get life instead attacking honest helpful reviewers site . it clear big gray board 125 sq . larger than large green baseplate previous reviewer erroneously lists extra 25 sq . extra play value . considering market this toy aged 3 12 years old , pointing out such significant error quite valuable . i not know many 3 year olds compute area basic shape so such errors pointed out imperative such audiences . what importance how large green baseplate rank value versus big gray board -- make asinine remark just because you not share views commentor truly unwarranted . reviewer named " g-had " , it shame you not fully accredit large green baseplate full-blown toy -- merely " part " toy . such debasement integral vital component lego universe shows how narrow minded you . must i remind you there other reviewers able obtain hours replay value just single big gray board piece alone . i concede versatility large green baseplate somewhat dimished smaller surface area green color . however , this piece deserves honored one major innovations lego brick system . furthermore , i suspect you may posting your review this product fraudulanetly your review hints you not comprehend basic facts this product . please recheck your facts ** play ** toy before posting review . this toy clearly 10 " 10 " not 15 " 15 " . your lack knowledge such basic fact toy suggests you never played this toy before let alone pleasure enjoy pure delight playing this piece . i deplore you please remove your review this product or revise your rating until you chance play this piece . i would interested your honest opinion regarding this piece well much-vaunted big gray board ** after ** you played them	1

we've played this game 10 times each time it played out differently . it takes 40 minutes play out game ; there not many decisions make each turn so game move quickly . we've played both two four handed - it worked both ways . counter keeping score bit funky , but not distract .	1
i am glad i bought this game . it not involve any money or any pen paper ( which rather unusual ! ) scoring moving people around 50 point track , if you lap it , you get 50 point card addition whatever else you point track . this keeps focus game-play , while still allowing point reference throughout game . pieces ( box ) high quality , game enjoyed children well adults . reason i like this game two players play this game alone , sometimes it hard find games like . you typically two owners game third person ( friend ? ) who comes over plays less often always disadvantage . also , game doesn't last too long . you not going get bogged down hours , you " get game " before you go bed , or before you go out . if you enjoy this game , there some expansion sets this game you also purchase . they each add additional pieces additional rules , they change strategy make it more interesting ( just when you might getting tired game ! )they following : carcassonne inns cathedralscarcassonne traders builderscarcassonne princess dragoncarcassonne towercarcassonne river ( sort mini-expansion)if , however , you think you would like purchase them all once , instead one one down road , you elect purchase " carcassonne : big box " instead . this contains full original game well all expansions listed above . it bundled together big discount , well big space savings -no extra boxes lying around . addition , if you enjoy carcassonne , you also purchase separate standalone games related carcassonne , but which not expansions , which cannot played part original game ( or any expansions listed above ) . they following : carcassonne hunters gathererscarcassonne castlecarcassonne citycarcassonne ark covenantfinally , those who enjoyed this game , i must also recommend other strategy games manufacturer , rio grande games . i also purchased strategy card games " lost cities " " san juan " this manufacturer , enjoyed them immensely well !	1

this so cute ! i think st. bernard cutest , but i love them all ! they so cute inexpencive . there few moderate cons , though : 1 . cat sometimes falls over . 2 . pieces get lost easly . 3 . if you put collar st. bernard , his head doesn't bobble . 4 . illustration bunny , he hes ice skates . but ice skates don't fit him ! even those cons way , this one my favorite lps .	1

true grimm fairy tale hansel gretel not pleasant picture most interpretations show it . here figure shows terror should filled little hansel . stand alone figure , it not best this series ; alongside gretel figure , it gets twisted its own right it looks though gretel not candy witch who tortures him . this one may most delicate set but still great rendered piece sculptor . its own it only gets three stars , set , it moves up four stars	1
our 17 month old son received this playhouse christmas it big hit !!! it just right size our living room not huge any means but not small either fits nicely corner . he loves closing opening door . it only took my husband , brother , dad 20 minutes put together .	1
we bought this house our son when he one year old , age 4 1/2 he his still using it -- even sharing his little ( 1 year old ) brother . both boys love it hiding place when we play hide seek , they both use it imaginative play their own intiative . course they also love diving out through side window . . . but we very pleased this purchase . one caveat : we initially installed house kids ' playroom ( what most people call living room ) keep it nicer while , set up nice play area rainy days . however we now item put spot want move it outdoors , but it won't fit through our front door or sliding back doors -- roof just shade too wide , we've difficulty reversing screws take roof off . so indoors it still . i'd say width roof only design flaw ; otherwise we completely satisfied product	1

i like simon hand held because you start following pattern stopping point when you lose . then you frusterated determined it again . even if you beat simon it still calling you play again . it very addicting hand held . i go o.t. my theripist introduced me simon i started playing it i spent 30 minutes trying beat simon . i beat him once i beat him again right when i leave . i still can't beat it again . my theripist tryed it wasn't even close . she spent 10 minutes figuring it out . she didn't get after 10 minutes gave up . so if you decide make more simon hand helds , your sake money you might want make it more difficult so it even more addicting .	1
simon excellent tool improving memory . it stimulates mind provides great satisfaction way . handheld version compact easily carried around your pocket . i absolutely love it whenever i am little down , i play it immediately forget my troubles . i recommend this all kids especially adults who trouble remembering	1

i two daughters so my husband i purchased two these dolls christmas . my seven year old plays her doll more than my five year old . my five year old says doll talks too much she wishes she would just go sleep quiet . my daughters given just every doll comes out i thought this would their favorite boy i dissapointed when i learned otherwise . doll isnt worth 100.00 or even close it . wait until price goes down . both dolls lips peeled within first couple days doll . my daughters take excellent care their toys so i know this wasnt their fault . i dont know what happened voice recognition . because both dolls respond anyone . yes ! i read instructions yes i programmed doll properly . i noticed some saying they not any problems their dolls lot us same problems dolls . which steers me believe obvious ... some us got stuck some major malfunctioning dolls . i've reprogrammed doll twice just make sure yep its doll . what waste money ! still interested ? just make sure you one functions properly if not you sadly dissapointed	1
i can't believe this ! i remember begining 90s , people treated 80s lllooooooooonnnggg time ago , i completely different era . i only 5 when 90s started , but it still drove me mad 90s when people talked how lllllooonnngg ago 80s . whenever people 90s said things like " oh , happened way back there 80s " i'd just get confused look my face ! it just few years ago people ! now , what this this game ? well , people today doing exact same thing ! they treat 90s way back there , even though we're just few years removed 90s ! news , music , culture 90s not way back time . far i'm concerned , they still fall under category " current events " opposed " ancient history " label people starting give them . its 2005 people ! 90s aren't ancient yet	-1
i introduced 90 game over weekend , i honestly say i am hooked . format game absolutely perfect , questions cover complete social , political , business issues relevant 1990 . length game totally depends how savy you your 90 trivia . board game action get surprisingly intense , i would consider this must buy	1
i owned toy store this dollhouse i selected my daughter ( who then 2 ) . she now 3 loved every minute playing this house , furniture dolls . house withstood rambunctious play , * i * only one break furniture ( i stepped chair heavy boot i wearing -- but amazingly , only leg popped off , rest chair still intact could fixed if i motivation ... ) dolls beautiful , heavy felt wired body easy movement . they unlike other dollhouse dolls wooden heads pegged bodies , which i felt inappropriate young child . all all , this brightly colored , well made dollhouse should last my daughter until she old enough either grow out it , or want grow traditional , hand-made set .	1
within six months owning this 50% furniture fell pieces . some wodd glue clamp fix but price you should not make constant repairs . save your money	1
i would love review it but i never received this product , therefore i never purchase amazon again !!!	-1

whoever writing comments memory size wrong how nuch it holds . it hold 2 hours music 128kbits sound isn't too bad using your own cutom eq setting . if yours isn't , you're converting improperly !. it works fine fm tuner it besides holding pretty low quality video . i 4 different types/brands mp3 players there no comparison this my 80gig ipod but 350 . i got mine ebay 12 bucks new box which can't beat . paying 60 walmart or anywhere else way too much ( there certainly many other units price don't video but least 512mb if not gig ) . look ebay folks ! pet	1
i bought this my 9 y/o nephew christmas he wanting it since his birthday . it seems hottest toy get right now . i think your price $399 you charging totally outrageous this toy whoever buys it price even more stupid . i bought it toys-r-us $79 . they also it target , walmart etc . you must out your mind sell this price , it cute toy but it definitely not worth over $100 . even my nephew agrees	1
my 1-year old son loves this toy . it amazes me see how he figures out all himself how put ball into basket	1
my son got this christmas , even though he wasn't quite 9 months old . he liked it beginning played it , but now ( 12 months ) all i listen crowd cheer . if he can't find basketball , he'll put anything fit into basket . football used our favorite , but now it less so . my son trying hit baseball bat lights up every time , though only once he able make ball move . i no problems this i thought it fairly easy assemble myself . i've even given this gift others because my son loves it so much . i especially love it 2 sound levels , so outside it louder return , it slightly quiter inside	1
this toy very good . you build some very interesting different things ... out box regular blocks toys . this child imagination . my son i ( grandpa ) played it while kids where playing other games . it many things build unusual things . recently my grandson build crab claws .. you roll it claws open close . very nice	1

i bought this toy my son year ago , when he turned 4 . he loves it ! especially since pirates carribean came out . he spends hours playing island battle castle , which we also love . there few complaints previous buyers amount pieces fact it falls apart . there lot small pieces accessories we put little " treasure box " we bought walmart . ( just $3 box little buckle lock . ) our son stores small pieces there he hasn't lost any small pieces year . when he wants fully accesorize his island , he pulls them out sets them up . ( but he pretty organized kid . ) we love accessories because it adds so much adventure . island pretty compact if you follow instructions use little 3 prong footers . if you don't , it fall apart fairly easily . our son pick entire island up carry it room without it falling apart . note : if your child trashes things lot or likes hit , bang smash their toys , then this probably not toy them . but if they take care their toys vivid imagination , this toy them . all all , we love this toy would definitely purchase it again ! he got battle castle same year ( stated earlier ) we just got glow dark pirate ship which he loves ! we're going get pirate raider glow dark shark skeleton next .	1
this item horrible . it falls apart constantly . we tried hot gluing superglue , however , nothing works . even our 4-1/2 yr son told us throw this out he so frustrated . part appeal you take imaginext items reconfigure them , great concept . however , no matter how you configure them , they all fall apart . during assembly notice they not " click " you would expect . pieces never lock together , even bottom " base " pieces . we resorted putting all imaginext table him play , however , flat surface , bumpy surface , any surface , it falls apart . please not waste your money we . unfortunately we spent approximately $150 various imaginext last christmas . not make same mistake we . when 4-1/2 yr wants you throw out his toys , somethings wrong	-1
this one cheapest toys we got our daughter , it turned out one her favorites too . she also loved mator . small simple best little kids , i wish we would learned earlier	1
i grew up watching sesame street when i found this i knew i order it my daughter !! she loves it . she almost 4 months starting get into toys . she'll just lay there hold his snout ( would it called ? ) smiles away . great quality , it little smaller then i expected , but we love it ! worth every penny	1
i recieved car set it up according manufacturers instructions it didn't work ! i contacted manufacturer they mailed me shipping return label i returned it them . i am awaiting new or fixed car back them	-1
this really fun game . my grumpy husband who usually plays very little sit hours play this game . instructions easy understand , it type game you invite friend over they play easily after just one hand . very enjoyable	1
this game become one our favorites ! it helps develop math skills while fun . our older kids love how they " re-arrange " tiles laid out benefit their own hand . this game immense fun not only kids but also adults	1
i got this pogo thinking you could go 6 feet air but then it wouldn't go much higher than foot . if you're looking pogo looks cool you sould definately get this but if you looking pogo works don't get this .	-1
my son received this product christmas it didn't work . we tried calling manufacturer help number , but they only offered pre-recorded help referred you their website . unfortunately , we couldn't find website tnt ric . we end up exchanging it discovery channel store one it works great . it easily stunts shown box . i'm now ordering one my nephew but tell his mom exchange it if there any problems	1
my son 4 years old . he really into thomas just amazed first time we started reading polar express played video . i playing idea getting this set him christmas opted get bachmann thomas sets since i not seen one these person he " really " into thomas tank engine . after christmas , major department store these 50% off suggested retail price . i could not pass this up . department store also one these display . all i say " wow " . locomotive actually metal . it smokes ; it whistle ; it lights up ; it train . power pack nice stout also . anyone who train sets kid , this blast past . it reminds me more my father lionel set 40-50s than plastic one i got one christmas kid . it very well detailed . i would probably paid full price felt ok it since it good quality . bell nice touch . figures neither here nor there . maybe if kids little older they might better . just note : fireman not same long hair video . track lot easier work than old lionel pins back day . you not need tack pieces down keep track together either . locomotive moves smoothly . it heavy stays track well . cars light up brightly . 4 years old , my son primarily watches hits whistle button . he operated speed little . track would tough him work . stick geo trax or wooden thomas if you not going work with/supervise your kids this . but then , set also recommended ages 8 above . minor downsides . when we tested unit , tender mid rail pickup not fully inserted shorted wheels next it . we fixed this all well . this item may packaging issue but appears ok now . i not run set up full throttle , but it looks like it might derail full speed . ( we this table derailing it would meant doing " drop " test . ) this just means someone needs good judgement experience setting speed . train also slow start after you set speed . ( i am not sure if this intended simulate inertia or not . ) again this probably means you want patient person throttle . other thoughts . it o scale ... so it takes up space . you rerail these easier than ho . radius curves included set , coaches seem little long . we also picked up hot chocolate car local retailer it sale . coaches plastic but look good . summary : i would definitely buy this set again . locomotive looks awesome accessories bit expensive ( my opinion least ) . bachmanns thomas sets good year round thing , but this one seems like it something special around christmas time	1
this solid first-quality train set would well worth asking price even if it wasn't affiliated popular book movie . fact , locomotive scaled-down model real locomotive , berkshire used pere marquette railroad ran near author home when he growing up . it lucky coincidence locomotive author painted book one lionel modeling since 1950s , all they change " paint job " create this fine model . case you wondered , this best steam locomotive lionel includes any its train sets . passenger cars also based same class real-world cars author painted book . number comments here fact first " run " train sold out before it even hit warehouses 2004 . nowadays , rush isn't so great , but doesn't mean there won't last-minute " run " set if network station shows movie december . unlike most " christmas trains , " though , this set tasteful enough used any o gauge railroad all year round . it built like lionel trains your grandfather grew up , solid enough last generations . happy holidays - paul race , editor , big christmas trains	1
great set buy ! it truly worth price $250.00 . only thing i wish it would come more track . because it only comes small oval track . but it still great set . i highly recommend it ! set very much resembles berksire cars movie . but good luck finding one until february	1
child , i played this game family vacations . rules simple , yet engaging . adults kids alike play pretty equal ground . kids like high-energy pace , adults amused idea " cornering market . " maybe i say because my father stock broker so it great hearing his over top analysis after each game . i can't really think anything negative say , except maybe your children might grow up , like me , inflated sense value wheat ( most valuable commodity game )	1
we introduced this game - big orange box , cards , bell - when i kid . i hadn't seen it years then i found it drugstore . i heard my family talking it , gave pack cards i bought my mom , since then it huge hit during holidays when family gets together . i just home christmas we loads fun . it get really noisey . i always recommend version bell because otherwise it not clear cut start finish , although you decide opening closing anouncement . very easy play introduce others , i didn't even realize until recently it meant teach kids stock market . fascinating ! if you love play games , this must your game cupboard	1
this my kids favorit game , my favorit play them . it goes fast you stop any time . you don't sit around wating your turn you don't remind your kids it there turn . every one plays same time . it get little loud all shouting . it realy easy concept understand . my 6 year old play it just fine . it best play least four people . i love fact this game almost 100 years old . you know it must good if it still around	1
i got this moon sand my kids christmas i gave it them early christmas gift . boy mistake ! it more heasdach then playdough ever . sand everywhere ! yes you may able vacume it up but we lost 1/4 sand first play . playdough you make sure there kitchen so when it falls it no big deal , you pick up big peices droped add them back mix , moon sand goes everywhere aside fact it doesn't come very much sand begin so course you need buy more which works well manufacture because they continuing customer . once this i happy show it garbage save me headach .	1
we bought this item my 3 year old , who just discovered playdoh , birthday gift . it far superior anything we able purchase locally our major retailers ~ shapes colors great , not all food related , which plus us , since we discouraging eating playdoh , obvious reasons . i would highly recommend anyone who looking great starter set their little ones learn love play doh	1
other then getting headache building set my son , its over 1000 pieces , i no complaints . it become central focus his super hero obsession his bedroom . none components difficult build , although spiral staircase cool its bit poorly designed because it often " collapses " rough play . addition while rotating car pad pretty neat , expect one single lego middle get broken second younger child trys spin platform hand . but onto good things ; detail excellent computer screens joker bomb glass case . mr. freeze just coolest lego man i seen , you get classic gray batman , robin , penguin , penquin sub , snowmobile robin , larger snowmocar batman penguin sub . my only grip there nothing mr. freeze ride/drive but if your child anything like mine remedied short order . it would nice if they labeled bags like batmobile/two-face chase set , 1000+ legos difficult sort through , but if you prepared then this set more than worth price your child love it years come	1
we purchased this sandbox several months ago after reading all positive reviews this website . it lived up its five star rating ! our toddler really enjoys playing this sand box . " natural " design reminds him stone castle he loves king his sandbox ! we filled it 200 pounds play sand still lots room numerous trucks , shovels , rakes , pails , seashells , sifters assorted sand toys . lid sturdy ( my son stood it it always pops back into shape ) high , domed center allows us store everything inside . we several violent wind/rain storms , lid stayed securely kept sand perfectly dry . i don't think color-fading over years issue tan plastic ( unlike some bright red or green sandboxes we also considered ) . 4 corner seats allow kids ( some parents ! ) sit play without getting sand their pants . you fit 1 , 2 or 3 small children or around box one time , but i don't think it large enough bigger crowd . you won't disappointed this sandbox ! it provide your kids many hours fun	1
we got this sandbox my younger son first birthday . we now it year . we it our backyard our patio it looks great . really blends not eyesore . rounded top very sturdy boys ( now 2 almost 4 ) stand it it doesn't bow or anything . however it lightweight enough easily taken off . we live southern coast where we get lots wind , rain sun . it held up marvelously still looks new . we lot mold mildew problems our outside toys because humidity , but this held up very well . we've never leaking problems either . i like seats corners kids sit . although they most often sit right sand course . we keep all sand toys housed box which convenient . we careful spiders deciding make it their home , but i just make sure check it before they begin playing . it easily fits 2-3 children plenty room . i would highly recommend this sandbox	1

let me first say i love kidkraft because they think like parents ! also , 12/9/06 amazon not correct image this item , pictures kidkraft trundle natural color , not honey . these trundles came my son train table kidkraft . i drawn them many reasons : * they big !!!! you can't fit all train pieces those other tables pull out drawers or tiny baskets slide underneath table . i love two trudles size table - huge ! *they casters . easy , easy out ! my kid it so i don't ! they easy enough roll around my 2-year-old son it his own . if you look carefully trundles , you'll see there even cut-outs small fingers grab trundles so they move them . it impossible smash your fingers trundle table . * they easy kids organize ! one side trundle rope handle , while other side chalkboard plate so you label what each ! ( or i , draw picture train picture train tracks so my kiddo knows what what since he can't read yet)*again , i mention they huge ?? these trundles well made casters fitting easily into place screwing pre-drilled hole . simple washer fits over top lays flush inside table so little ones can't hurt themselves sharp screws or hardware . my husband i these both put together ( he one while i other ) 10 minutes max . like i said beginning , these well thought out . i love features trundles - i'm sure parent involved creating these ! i also believe you get what you pay , while these some more ' expensive ' trundles market , they well worth it . after year play , they holding up just fine , very little wear tear ( that 2-year-old ! )	1
great twist traditional trivia game . advanced players like strategy involved deciding who you want guess first other small nuances . best part you fun geniuses those missing few tools toolbox ; everyone involved every round , so there no down time	1
i got it christmas . but i didn't open it until 29th . i started 5 p.m. ended 9 p.m. 4 hrs !!! last 2 days screaming serpent but didn't work planned . i don't know why though . i'll try again july 28 . anyway , if you're gonna get knex set someone they're rookie or never it before , i totally recommend this set . it greatest k'nex set i ever owned	1
all k'nex we bought , this one dissappointment . others stated , overall design clumsey cheap looking . chain mechanism works ok assistance , sliders fall off or get stuck . our son very clever these toys he confused instructions . oh yeah ... we several missing pieces .... maybe that why !! i say this though ... we got ours 50% off that only consolation buying this toy	1
assembly time : 3-4 hours ( 1 adult ) . time till broken : 45 mins ( 2 kids , ages 3 7 ) . gear system works motor pulling riders up top " canyon " broke less than one hour what i would consider average non-abusive play . chain flows around two gears , but when tiny bit resistance encountered , it gets stuck . there not enough torque overcome nominal resistance , even just overcome sprocket used adjust which chute rider goes down . i think it great concept , great toy , but apparently more thought or " horsepower " needs built into most important element product . once this broke , kids completely disinterested it . not mention seeing four hours time down " slide " just because manufacturer didn't properly qa or engineer $80 toy . i also agree other reviewers who said riders often get stuck , fall off , tumble upside down don't behave " auto-pilot " . however , this engage kids , provided more laughter than anything else it 45 min fun filled life . yes , we tried fresh batteries , chain right way ;)	-1
i 2 month old grandson living me , he cholic . sweet boy , but he barely ever wants you set him down . needless say few christmas gifts i bought , we pulled out play little bit early . this wonderful toy ! one most comforting things my grandson talked soft calm voice . i saw this toy shelf i am type who pushes all buttons test before buying . voice very soothing voice sweet " i love you baby " end perfect ! my grandson so far loves this toy . he doesn't take well many , but this one great animations music , keeps him interested ... best all it makes him laugh ! something he doesn't often yet . course we shake rattle ... but i am sure he learn how soon enough . definte 5 stars just hear him laugh smile ! recommended any finicky child	1
this most cutest toy i ever seen ....... i hope my baby love it much mum dad ..... * smil	1
bought this our 10 month old , even though it says ages 3 up . he really liked it would crawl through it quite bit . i am giving it 5 stars because it quality product great price	1

my 9 month old can't turn pages well normal books , so i got her this plastic one . it reads her , activities push or pull , lights up , sings her . pooh reinforces words we're already teaching her like up , down , right left , numbers . it takes aa batteries really easy change them . this great way introduce her one my childhood favorites .	1
i'm not sure who rating this but my expectations high this toy based all these raters giving this gadget 5 stars . i'm sorry say i don't think so . you cannot use it voice changer without record something each time . there other voice changers allow you add voice effects you speak . not this one . reduces fun effect . microphone doesn't capture voice well speakers weak . i play it near someone ear them hear it or tell all stay silent . reducing fun even more . some one here said you even clip it somewhere ? no clips found . nevertheless you still get giggles ( 1st star ) plus it includes batteries play out box ( 2nd star ) .	1
this my nine-year-old son favorite spy gadget . he got several cost lot more more bells whistles , but this one ends up his pocket most . he uses it more silliness than spying , but ends up giggles every time . it went through laundry once still works so i'm impressed its durability	1
i got this my almost 5 year old . she loves it plays it constantly , even after it 2 months . toy extremely durable . it dropped , left out very cold car , sat , etc . i only two issues this toy they 1 ) it very loud when not cushioned surface 2 ) sticks pictured left ariel not stay holder all . we lost one them . other than , i really like feature offered although sound quality when you play it yourself limited , it great overall	1
this game so much like " trivial pursuit " , you could use questions categories any those editions handicap game even further . i played two young adults ( under 18 ) some questions younger players completely unknown them . best part you only answer one question turn ( right or wrong ) so " ken jennings " can't win game first roll dice . there aren't enough questions supplied game , but i noted above , any multi-category trivia game questions used keep game interesting . overall , excellent purchase families enjoy evening trivia	1
my daughter got amigo bear christmas . she very interested spanish -- dora , sesame street all . she plays it trys imitate spanish words through out day . today bear became her " baby ' well . fun times not annoying	1
i intended buy kelly doll my 4 yo grandniece , but when i found this , i knew she'd love it ( which she ) . not only she get kelly , but she got 4 friends too , all things girls need pj party	1
my daughter two , almost 3 3 months . she likes it well enough , but fact paint takes moment react show up frustrating her . i love paint inclosed brush , but difficult get out paint i hesitate showing her she squeeze it . whole point keep it brush , yes ? perhaps if they caps prevent it drying out brushes could stay moist paint ? paint comes out one place , so its all concentrated center brush , so you need work it bristles , or big globs paint go throught it faster . side note , paint dries crunchy clothes . also , my local target this set extra brush , 9.99 michaels it 11.99 , no shipping !	1
i ordered this tamagotchi my granddaughter valentine day . she looking v4 one stores weeks they sold out . she very excited received this it hit !	1
i 4 y.o. boy this produce right up his alley . we lot rescue heros this product brings them al together . this what he wanting play all his men vehicles . mission command center easy put together very durable . my boy loves destroy toys he cannot tear this up .	1
first negative . men go this , rh mission select men no longer made . they difficult find after market price , some cases , higher than price new rh . only other negative price it would nice some ' cubbies ' store back packs , etc . now positive . if you mission select rescue heroes then this great toy . figures talking back forth each other offer new level play . but talking figures not take away imagination play your child . it merely provides backdrop their play . this not big other command center boat . large positive my mind it even folds down bit when not use . note , not folds down carry around , it just folds into itself bit making it bit more compact . contrary one review this not difficult set up . it took young boy age 7 his mother less than 30 minutes get up running ready play . directions clear easy follow . every part this , even back , something rescue heroes . there climbing wall search light ( doesn't really work too bad ! ) crane life cars or people or animals ( according my son ) up top roof . rescue heroes all accompanying items such command center very fun . they positive characters save lives . they large so small hands easily play them yet there enough ' small items ' like backpacks even older children fun switching backpacks around so . every piece this set , rescue heroes command center well played stood up well hours play . enjoy .	1
i know one main complaint there no more mission select rescue heroes figures left stores , they discontinued , some aftermarket prices getting up there ( especially rocky canyon , hardest find set ) . well , robotz figure line stores now features figures same connectors their back , so you get them talk . i don't know if it main phrases would said if you mission select figures , but they talk . instance , when i hook mission select backpack billy blazes ( only mission select figure we ) up rocky canyon , rocky says phrase each turn dial . they sound like follow up phrases , if he second figure communicating mission select figure , but you still get some voice interaction !! mission select , voice tech , robotz figures should all come same metal contacts their backs ( except ones like robotz gil gripper , whose robot stands alone not connect him ) , so they all work some way each other items . macc , it definitely center rescue heroes world , biggest playset released toy line date . while it may not most exciting , it gives your children central area congregate figures vehicles . least it keep figures all over house ! i think size money , it could featured some trap doors or compartments , but elevator mission command voices rh leader warren waters all you get	1
my daughter received this doll christmas , her sister received blonde version not bilingual . they really enjoyed playing interacting dolls . we not found cloth legs drawback all , instead find dolls little more cuddly way . my girls 3 4 i also home daycare all girls here ( well my 3 older sons ) periodically picked up these babies play them . i would go 5 stars but voice quality sometimes less than perfect	1

this story fish who glittery scales . all other fish wanted like rainbow fish , so they would invite him play them . rainbow fish self-centered always said no . once little blue fish asked if he could glittery scale , but rainbow fish said no . all other fish grew angry him not speak him . rainbow fish worried went advice wise octopus . octopus told rainbow fish kind others not selfish . so rainbow fish went back home gave little blue fish scale . blue fish so happy he couldn't wait show off his glittery scale . soon after , all fish wanted glittery scales . rainbow fish gave everyone scale became friends again . i think this great book children because it teaches them lesson . lesson learned always share you'll many friends .	1
my son saw this pirate ship wanted it , even though he beautiful large wooden one . i gave bought it him his birthday . it loaded little pieces make detail impressive . my husband put it together , it didn't take him very long . i highly recommend it great pirate ship any age	1
we got this our pirate-obsessed 4 year old christmas - it now august , i'd guess he played it almost every day since then . i know some people complain its fragility quot ; tiny-nessquot ; some pieces , but i think this great way teach child care his belongings - we've still got just every piece , included those four tiny wine goblets . it also great developing small muscle control - our son gotten very adept putting tiny swords tiny hands , loves mixing matching hair , beards , etc . it probably not every child - but i pretty much worship playmobil !! no other toys come close capturing pur son imagination attention	1
playmobil toys wonderful , no question , but more elaborate they , more problematic . this ship gorgeous great detail , including real string rigging . this toy took forever assemble , especially pesky rigging , usually excellent insrtuctions falling short . after day playing , my two boys dismantled ship enough it wasn't fun anymore , after three days i could no longer get all parts back together . it now somewhat expensive box filler . other playmobil pirate sets still much loved , conscripted nearly invincible good ship fisher-price	1
i bought this my daughter room so she could listen classical music while she sleeps . i going buy regular cd player then i seen this one . it matches her room beautifully works great . she too little carry it around or use it herself ( she 1 1/2 ) , but she loves her " pretty radio " she calls it . we haven't any problems ours " toxic " cord , i plugged it once i don't plan moving it so its not problem me . only thing i don't like cd player skips if you bump it . it doesn't happen if you walk it or shut dresser drawer hard , only if you tap it or bump it accident . i thought odd considering it designed carried around , but since ours just sits dresser i don't problem it unless i hit it . overall it great cd player . adorable functional !	1
this item great i got this two months ago it still works just fine i making movies my friends awhile now we always lightsaber fights we hit hard we both my friends i make movies others they both well work just fine they've them longer but only problem waving sound little sensitive even who needs batteries any way it shoots up self thats good enough me .	1

this product absolutely useless . " paint " so thin it not work advertised . you cannot write it body or walls . complete waste money	-1
my 4 yr old begged begged this toy i finally gave when i found it clearance . after playing it maybe hour , even he said " mommy , this waste money ! " if he doesn't follow directions exactly order said , or tries skip ahead , game unable keep up then he gets frustrated . i'm really glad we didn't pay anything close full price this useless piece plastic	1
item just awsome . we play it every night . we could only purchase department stores cards not complete game . it so much more fun board	1
after struggling find gift she would enjoy would also provide little educational content , i'm happy i wound up choosing global puzzle . it good challenge her , but not so difficult she got frustrated or bored gave up . i would gladly recommend this product others children this age range .	1
during christmas , i bought this puzzle entertain my 5 , 6 8 year old nieces nephews while my sister cooked dinner . i am not puzzle person , but thought it might keep them busy teach them something same time . i right . what surprised me how much fun i 29 year old completing puzzle ! i shocked how little geography i knew . during holidays , we ball completing puzzle saved it . each time i come over , we go look puzzle identify new places members our family traveled . great product	1
okay , so it not really educational , however , my older kids , who big snl fans , gotten good sense older shows game . we've blast playing this together . little game pieces snl characters , however , they mostly recent ( land shark conehead only older ones . ) pieces cute though ! really funny . one disappointing thing while dvd plays portion skit , it doesn't play whole skit . surely , dvd ( part $40 game ! ) , they could included entire skits . i like questions general , found game challenging , but not overwhelmingly challenging . i think it great average snl fan	1
this so fun i love saturday night live i love this game go sparta	1
my son loved this book so much he got up 6 a.m. next day ( lucky me ! ) just play it . unlike most toys , this one stayed close used frequently since then . so this would bargain even full price . this discounted price , wow	1
i bought this my 5 year old son . this far best leap pad book he received . he played it almost daily over month now . cards make it extra fun him they easy keep track if you keep book/disc cards package .	1
wonderful learning toy ... well made everyone loved bright colors ! thank you selling quality toys well worth amount paid ... which more than reasonable .	1
i bought this toy thinking , " well , it plays music ... maybe it keep my son occupied . " he loves it ! he spins tummy wheel over over again ! you may find yourself humming music times like i ! there on/off switch back so you don't wear battery down , also 2 volume levels so you set it loud or soft . luke face lights up every time i bring it out . it doesn't bounce or tricks , but tummy lights up plays music when you spin it , my 8-month old play ever it ! any child who loves spin things or play balls blast this little elephant ... it even sings 2 bedtime songs . singing voice very soft gentle , making it even more appealing . price , it definitely worth purchasing	1
" idea " adorable it looks amazing box , but actualy product very poor quality . it takes forever blow up , then we couldn't get headboard part stand up straight . it kept leaning . construction very poor also . sides attached oddly not made last ( hard explain , but it not one sold piece , each section seperate ) . ours also slow leak would partially deflate morning causing castle ( which already leaning ) collapes . i called , e-mailed wrote company get replacement ( i couldn't return it ) they would never respond . you leave voicemail message company i couldn't get live person . after 3 months i gave up junk sitting closet . i wish disney didn't allow their name put this product	-1
this one most frustrating toys i ever used my child ! it not work :	-1
my 5 year old daughter , who seen me return home pottery studio my works hand , really excited received her own pottery wheel her birthday . we both greatly disappointed find wheel power so insufficient each time she even gently placed her hands clay , wheel came grinding halt . given this , it impossible even teach her basics centering clay , let alone create any sort thrown piece . i not expect this work well wheels i use , but i expect she could least learn few fundamental skills . this product completely disappointing i would not recommend it , particularly if there no parent throwing experience . if this best product out there , i recommend sticking hand building clay -- they learn thrown wheel when they old enough go proper studio	-1
i purchased my granddaughter . she love bake this great educational tool	1
if you love sugar cookies , chocolate cookies , yellow cake i really , really think you should get this super value pack , ' cause instead just getting 4 easy-bake mixes , you get 12 mixes , i don't know you , but i think great super value i think you should go nearest toysrus , or where ever you get your mixes get this easy-bake oven super value pack	1
dangles so soft , squishy cuddly ! we got this our son when he just few months old . it quickly became his favorite snuggle toy . he 1 year old now must his monkey snuggle order go sleep . unfortunately he likes suck his tail it get quite yucky . fortunatley dangles washes very well ! i put him washer handwash cycle then tumble him dry 90 minutes fluff/no heat dryer he ready go time next nap ! although he not perfectly soft fluffy he when we got him , what you expect toy washed washing machine constantly dragged around ! i rated dangles 3 stars educational value . you might not think stuffed toy educational , but we think he ! when we ask our son where monkey eyes , mouth , nose ears , he points right them . he gets his hands feet mixed up , but he'll figure it out soon ! we purchased extra dangles nana house avoid crisis forgetting bring him .	1
combined jump-o-line this toy great . they not maintain thier shape very well but that fine because they soft safe . younger kids use them games learn colors . soon they more stock i'm buying two three hundred	1

my entire family loves this card game . it fast-moving , playing pairs results unpredictable moments . teams try advance car race collecting using mileage cards , while their opponents try give them flat tires car accidents using " hazard " cards . although directions may seem complex , it takes just few minutes understand rules this simple game . it nice portable game those who travel	1

i bought several these use our church . they excellent alternative standard globe . i didn't want spend bunch money regular globes , we don't lot room store them . these globes deflated easily stored when they're not use . also , if you using them classroom , you want child identify country globe , you simple throw it them . believe it or not , we didn't any trouble kids getting rambunctious it , but it keep their interest	1
my 7 year old son thinks these planets really cool realistic looking . he now name all planets he thinks they realy neat look day or night . i would give this 5 stars but intensity glow not very bright even if i leave lights awhile before bed time	1
we completely disappointed this set . our boys ( ages 3 5 ) received it gift ... i certainly hope purchaser didn't pay $20 ! planets flimsy plastic balls two pieces . they various sizes , but not remotely scale . fishing line tacks tedious assemble . gift buyers should sure recipients want attach nine planets their celing tacks extra adhesive putty ( not everyone ! ) . we would much rather cool mobile where planets could rotate around sun ( which missing this set ) . ours going trash soon	1
we got this over two years ago my daughter when she 6 months old . we looking mobile wasn't " traditional . " she still loves it so her baby sis . yes , there isn't sun , but if you look proportions , you would need beach ball sun ! we hung planets differ lengths fishing line . our only problem jupiter too low we kept hitting it . easy fix . don't forget put star stickers star tacks . if tack fall out ceiling , you use flashlight night locate it quickly !	1
my 8 year old 6 year old love this game ! it genius make game played 3 ways . never get bored it . although my daughters love horses , so couldn't possibly ever happen	1

my 8 year old daughter loves horses mad riding . she loves game - partly gameplay partly information game cards ( which list colours , breeds characteristic markings horses ) . fact there three variations game some solitaire versions included just bonus	1
i surprised how strong spring . it works great , really only kids , obviously doesn't look realistic adults . good laugh	1
my only gripe colors , ha ha ha ... seriously , got some these just because i'm immature wanted play even though i'm bit old it i suppose ... ended up loving them , quite surprised what you get so little money really . kudos toy cheap versatile , fact , works described !!!	1
i originally purchased 4 these my husband father day play our three boys $5.00 each plus free shipping , i thought if they didn't work , what heck , i spent $20.00 they pretend they work ! well , when they opened them up got them figured out , ( it took good hour because they very sophisticated)they didn't put them down all day ! i wished i would bought one everyone their friends block ! what great value ! they play them everyday- outside inside ! i am so glad i got these-a very good bonding experience father sons ! week after i received these , i went circuit city sure enough , these shelf $50.00 each ! you won't regret this purchase !	1
these little gadgets pretty fun play games them good way take break work few minutes !	1
my son saw this advertised tv begged it christmas . i looked it everywhere finally found one last one shelf right before christmas thought it great score . wrong ! after playing it 10 minutes , watching alien " balls " fizzle like alka seltzers til they exposed couple cheap , plastic toys , he completely lost interest . van poorly constructed parts not fit back , nor it stay together . just try store it shelf without it falling apart spilling its contents everywhere . this piece junk going right give-away bag . my son won't miss it	-1

i bought this my eight year old christmas bunch " whats popular now " toys . this far toy kept his attention more than few minutes . more like nearly 2 hours first time we took it out . it also kept my 6 year old daughter every adventerous 4 year old busy . i keep dad digging dusting or else kids wouldn't gotten turn . after finding three bones - i told them it time put it away save it day . my husband wouldn't quit 30 minutes until they found unearthed one more bone . they many hours fun left which return give them added bonus -- not only they fun ; but learning same time !! one consideration it say ages 8 above , but my 4 year old his sun glasses managed quite well . his only problem getting dad out way !!! highly recommend !	1
i'm really pleased this toy . i didn't want one would fall over easy or spoke spanish . i just wanted simple toy my son would enjoy longer than 5 minutes . this it . my 13 month old pull himself up easily it play it . i lean it against wall since it would slide hardwood floors but we haven't any problems it . he keeps going back it play it it one first toys he plays morning . i think because it so many things he doesn't get bored easily . it alphabet numbers well colors texture shapes . then you switch it music ( which he loves dance ) keys all light up which grabs his attention . my 4 year old enjoys playing it well .	1
this product lot different things touch press . my son play this while before he even thinks getting bored . he especially loves picking up balls underneath unit , standing up putting them through chute . my son 13 months , my only complaint myself not purchasing this toy earlier !	1

my daughter got this her second birthday . she loves it . she gets so excited when we get it out . my favorite part how small it fold up . my 4 year old daughter also loves tent	1
my 8 1/2 year old daughter got this four years ago christmas i honestly say it one our most used toys ! it set up all over house outside too . up until last year she would still sleepovers it ( it getting little small her now ) . but it still taken out set up quite often . i usually set it up myself ( i am 5'tall , less than 100 lbs . it extremely easy simple me . ) unlike previous reviewer , we never problems tearing , it amazingly durable . i 18 month old now , he also loving it . i use just tunnel him sometimes , too ! we love it so much i am getting one my two nieces this christmas . this one toy you get lot miles out !	1
rather than call boggle jr game i would call it educational tool . it very boring ! it several dice each sides labeled w/a letter . there also flash cards you put holder cover up either 3 or 4 letter words look picture spell words dice . that basically it . whoever spells most words correctly wins . not most fun game but would great teach or improve childs spelling	1
interesting reading other reviews . i guess if you very strict interpretation what game , you may disappointed there no music , beeper , timer , or lights . i think there clearly winner this game , it my 3 yr old learning word recognition . he knows his alphabet , but this game shows him all those letters make words . my son gets very excited when he see he completed word . i think this game excellent learning tool . i also breathe sigh relief when i find game or toy these days not lights , sounds , batteries . i however , add one sidenote , agree reviewer . we found couple words not formed , because occasionally two letters needed form word same block . you eventually spell letter changing blocks around . this definetly error make things tricky little one . however , it only couple words	1
all my friends family love this game , always wanting play or borrower it . so many people looked it stores yet find it , i say you buy it amazon . we played all types friends family , even our grandparents who their late 70s love it , well cousins there teens	1

this game teaches math skills , reading using reasoning skills . te animation wonderful sponge bob crew keep my 5 year odl daughter enternained hours ! great buy !	1
idea this game child helps sponge bob collect ingredients create new secret sauce . animation cute , but games too easy ( my son 4 ) it takes too long collect ingredients . once enough ingredients collected , child then gets play " kitchen chemistry " which not much fun . child either guess recipe or tap or spongebob get it . patrick taste test it funny watch his reactions , but " kitchen chemistry " just not exciting , interesting nor challenging enough keep child coming back more . addition " kitchen chemistry " , cartridge four other games : " counting claw " : 3 levels , deals counting change . child sticks coins into slot until he put right amount . my son blindly sticks coins slot until spongebob reacts . then he enjoys playing claw machine game wacky prizes come out . but he learns nothing . " conveyor chaos " : very similiar bunny game comes leapster system . little better , but not very versatile . " musical garden " : child only play assorted sea music until timer runs out . child symphony not played back . music appreciation ?? whatever . " bubble scrubber " : one redeeming game this cartridge . unfortunately it only deals 4 letter words . there nothing entice child try more challenging levels . i get my son start using level 3 instead 1 playing it him now he prefers level 3 . although i know value repetition , few more words would nice . after experiencing first grade ( which still my son favorite ) , i disapointed . this game only mediocore .	1
once again , amazon sold this toy lowest price $3.99 . later i found out nursery addition house includes twins .	1
i wish i could give this toy zero stars , but amazon doesn't rating . this item selling like crazy ebay , so when i found it here , i snapped it up . normally , i don't buy things until i've able check them out first hand . this precisely reason why . i opened this figure pushed button make it work . first time , it just made panting noise like scrat character movie . 2nd time , it collapsed tipped over made more panting noises . every other time i tried operate toy , it one those two actions . i honestly can't tell if i got broken toy or if this supposed how toy works . it looks like toy suppose scoot across ground , but mine tends tip over most time . either way , it doesn't really anything . i think even youngest kids bored this toy after 20 minutes it'll end up bottom toy box after . , now , i'm wondering why i so interested toy begin . my advice would save your money , because , unless you get it like [ ... ] or less , it not worth it	-1

this got coolest lightsaber i ever purchased ! granted , it my first fx saber , but not my first master replica . hilt details amazingly accurate blade lot brighter than i expected ( especially only three aa batteries ) . my only problem now which one get next ; obi-wan ( episode iii ) , luke ( vi ) , or darth maul ( double-bladed version ) ..	1
hilt very well constructed doesn't feel flismy like some other fx lightsabers . ease changing batteries also welcome change ( see anakin skywalker blade ) . tip blade looks cheap , always . some point , mr got create slightly-tapered , one piece " sheath " leds electronics , but i'm sure would add cost . color blade nice , but same problem darth maul saber ... red gets washed out bright areas , while dark , if you look relatively closely , there dark spots blade where individual leds connect . sounds both good bad ; power-up/down idle hum loud more menacing than good guy sabers . triggered slash/clash sounds kind bleh ... they sound good , but extremely unpredictable ( sometimes swinging it all you're worth doesn't produce peep , while slightly shifting your hands handle could trigger it several times ) . this problem any fx line if batteries low or compartment loose , but what mr customer service told me , this problem more common/prevalent vader blade	1

we used this monitor ( dual receivers ) 2 different houses now over 18 months . we think monitor very sensitive ; i hear my son breathing if i turn up receiver volume , other relatively quiet noises register light display well . we love lights it allows us other things ( like talk phone or play music ) still know if our child needs us ; they also great night , we usually leave volume very low . only static issues we when we plugged certain types electronics into same outlet receiver it created bad hum , when we left our cellphones right next receiver it would occasionally chirp . when plugged there always low white-noise background hiss , also visible 1 constant bar light , not there when they run batteries , but this neither loud nor troublesome even my normally sensitive ears unless volume very high . we specifically wanted model would run outlet power , but appreciate we occasionally unplug take monitor outside battery power while we yardwork . overall we very pleased . added bonus , units durable enough we let our toddler " discover " how they work carry them around without worry or damage	1
this monitor not work well . this lot static it not sensitive sound . this one going back	-1

we bought this my daughter her 2nd birthday . it best 6 volt ride-on toy i found . i lot research most little ride-on 2-3 year old either too small(her knee hit handlebars she very petite ) , too slow ( they wouldn't go grass or up any slopes also only 2 mph ) . this one perfect size 2 year old i think she fit it couple more years . it say up age 5 or 6 up 50lb . we going get her barbie jeep but they just too big her she couldn't even reach peddal . pro's:-great size 2-4 year old's-great speed 3.5 mph ( fast enough you need little helmet if riding cement)-light enough ( you pick it up one hand put it back garage)-cute color little girl pink purple-very durable-battery stay charged forever . ( we only charged it first time she rode it 3 hours 29 day later it still going strong)-goes our grass small rock area fine ( sometime we give it just little nudge keep it going these areas)-good price $99 sear free shipping time . con's:-doesn't adjustmeant speed so it could go little slower when they just learning . -doesn't reverse . -battery located under seat only velcro holding it together . ( although my daughter hasn't yet figured it out)-you can't take battery out charge it like your counter , you hook up charger bike . -steering isn't all great , can't make sharp turns . ( fine if you large area them ride)-assembly took longer then 10 minutes me . you need someone muscle hammer last bolt . 30 minutes me then i wait untill my hubby came home hammer bolt . all all i would recommend it .

our son really likes sink his teeth this toy . easy use wash . makes good noise get his attention but not overwhelming	1
this one my favorite games . it also excellent way enrich one vocabulary . this day i recommend using dictionary when you play just sure no neologisms sneak . still , extent which other players try win fun game itself . i love this game !	1
scrabble word game anybody play long they spell language which game played . it lot fun but it wise dictionary hand settle disputes arise when somebody creates dubious word or spelling . dictionary should only used settle disputes - leafing through its pages trying find word fits your letters definitely cheating . game intended played two four players but it possible practise alone i'll explain how later , though it isn't much fun playing against person . if more than four people available , they either team up or just find something else use instead racks hold tiles . scrabble comes various editions but all them certain things common . there 100 tiles each letter them , four racks ( one hold each payer tiles ) bag into which all tiles placed start game which all players draw letters game progresses . main playing area board 15 15 squares , most which standard gray color . some squares red , pink , dark blue or pale blue - these premium-scoring squares ( triple word , double word , triple letter , double letter respectively ) . begin , each player draws seven tiles bag . first player makes word any or all their letters places it board , beginning , ending or crossing central square , which automatically gives them double word score . ( it pink ) replaces used tiles corresponding number tiles bag . subsequently , players take turns create new word ( thereby building crossword board ) , attempting score many points possible . any tiles added must all form part one word link tiles already board but strategy well vocabulary useful . most time , you just place letters focusing existing tile board , using tile part word you create , however , if you letter your rack , you may able add it end existing word while also using it part word your own , if there clear room board you so . thus , you score your own word but you also score word you made into plural . this just one example how you ( sometimes ) score more than word while sticking rules , but it teaches you not waste letters - keep them when they most effectively used . when there no more tiles bag , play continues until one player uses up all their tiles or nobody able . point , points unused tiles still players ' racks deducted their score . play alone quite simple , if less satisfying . object score many points possible . obviously , scoring much easier since you build crossword very open design - you aren't trying block your opponents - but if you find those opponents usually beat you , bit practice your own might improve your chances beating them future . so , if you decide buy scrabble , it comes down deciding whether buy deluxe edition ( if you afford it ) , travel edition ( taking away home you ) or standard edition . just make sure you dictionary hand settle disputes , otherwise it won't much fun	1
scrabble my favorite board game all time . it fun play not ever get boring . game not only fun challenging but it very educational . game made up 30% luck 70% skill . this perfect percentage breakdown . there enough luck involved so everyone chance win(if skill levels not too different ) enough skill involved so game not ever become boring	1

this my second replogle globe . replogle best ! their pioneer world globe little everything ( well almost ) . it shows major cities , raised relief mountains , ocean currents , color-coded countries states , legend . like most their globes , it also comes plastic time zone dial over north pole , so you sort figure out what time it other parts world compared others . my favorite feature which stands out among others its gyroscopic apparatus , which enables you tilt earth upside down without lifting its base , so you see antarctica its entirety . other lower-priced globes , you lift whole globe , base gets way , so you really cannot see antarctica . there two things i dislike this globe . it no topographical information , but i suppose what atlantis world globe . ( i guess you cannot everything . ) also , it scratches easily , so don't bang it around . insignificant thing i notice placement political information . because globe constructed strips cardboard ( like orange peels ) , none city , state , or country names printed across two strips . it not take away quality information ; it just quirky look . i am very detailed-oriented pay attention everything . most you probably not even notice this	1
although cold nose puppies cute cuddly , my children love playing them , i am still very disappointed would not buy this toy again because mentioned other reviews , battery packs not stay inside toy . velcro not stay fastened . i am tempted sew this toy together , but would create problem when it time replace batteries . i cannot believe manufacturer would design such poor battery compartment . amount money toy cost , i expected it designed much better	1
i bought cold nose puppy my little sister she really likes she not want share it	1
rules two sentences long off you go . terrific gateway game people who played othello but maybe never played " euro game " . rules lines dominoes components quite nice . lots room improvement more you play , but early plays equally rewarding . great great game	1
after playing enjoying lost cities game designer reiner knizia , i decided stop our local game store check out ingenious . last night my wife i played it first time , lost cities , we loved it . immediately after playing we wanted play again . there no doubt my mind we not tire game . common quality lost cities ingenious share " addiction " factor ; both games you saying " let play again " over over again expense sleep . i don't believe greater compliment said game than this . ingenious incredibly easy learn , takes less than 1 minute after setting game up you begin playing . game play consists playing hexagonal chips 6 different colors board turn-based play . chips like hexagonal dominoes , 2 hexes connected , each hex containing different color . once no chips placed upon board , game over . player who lowest amount points any 6 colors loses . game strategy requires you score points each color , this requires concentration strategy . understand ingenious not strategy game leave you frustrated , overwhelmed weary . no , ingenious not like . ingenious just enough strategy you scampering win , just enough random luck make it unpredictable . my favorite part ingenious ? all players know when board full , game over . there end sight , just like lost cities , you play against yourself just much you play against your opponent . your strategies kill you , or leave you victor . spend too much time acquiring points one color , you might sacrifice your victory . try it , you won't regret it . i paid over $35 my local gaming store , it worth every dollar . game sturdy components , assure you playing it 10 years . 1 4 players . yes ! you even play this addictively fun game solo	1

" two hours later my wife read me other two reviews ... too late return product . anyway , valve stems , springs , rocker arms work terrific ... until they're assembled . then they barely move all . amazingly i able get spark plugs light .... after testing brand new batteries make sure they juice because silly lights would not turn . then i tested battery box ( i got voltage tester christmas now this wonderful opportunity learn how use it ) . tester , however , work advertised i discovered battery box functioned . i then pulled little motor out which miraculously worked when i placed it back into it brace ... hmmm ... go figure . now it time break out champaign . i turned out all lights fired up ignition . my 10 year old son still thinks it pretty cool even though he wasn't able assemble much anything . he manage open packaging without help though	-1

i bought this lego toy because we've several megablocks sets they fall apart over over again you build them . i hoped legos would better , but they're not . when built , fortress stands only 12 inches 12 inches , so scale small you can't really play it , given fact one wrong move sends whole thing crumbling . my son 7 experienced lego user , but even he said , " oh , man ! this bad megablocks . " this going end up our lego box spare parts , which sad considering we paid $39.99 it .	-1

i bought this bed my son when he 18 months old because he just would not sleep his crib . it take little elbow grease put together but not too bad . he slept it perfectly first night never fell out . i used mattress support his crib instead board ; there no boards my tru salesman suggested i use mattress support . i don't know why issue . my mattress fit perfectly there no gaps . this great toddler bed , however my son now three he constantly hitting sides night . i feel he no room move it . i am disappointed because i expecting get lots more use out it ! other reviews i read , this not seem common problem . perhaps my son just restless sleeper !!	1

this biggest wagon i could find . me it seemed best , it would fit three kids ( then 1 , 3 , 5 ) or two kids beachgear ( including shovels , chairs , food , parasol ) . good thing : it ! downside : it so big , it not easy handle kids sometimes even heavy adults (' big turn-circle ' ) . i would say : if you buy it transportation it ok , if you look wagon kids play : buy smaller version	1
my daughter loves riding her wagon . it also easy her grandparents take her around neighborhood around backyard	1

we got one these gift , couldn't get back panel batteries open . tried using small philips screwdriver , safety pin , etc ., it simply would not open . lack sound disappointing , though our child still liked pretty puzzle . we got battery-activated melissa doug toy also failure -- " vehicle sound block " toy supposed make sounds vehicles when blocks lined up correctly . we could get batteries , but toy simply didn't work . no sound , no nothin . ' this company seems well plain wood toys , but when they branch out into electronics , products fairly shoddy . i plan avoid their products future	1
i think we give them 5 stars . it true they very similar some other products out there , but they littlest pet shop toys which huge rage right now . pluses : keychain attachment seems pretty sturdy . i've it hooked my [ ... ] coat couple days now he hasn't pulled it apart . he doesn't " get " all pet combing stuff yet , but he really likes push buttons , watch screen hear music . great plus , volume very good level - loud enough hear , but not so loud drive mom nutzo . it seems like hamster monkey probably most rare - hard find around here . there tons dogs kitties available	1
this got worst toy we've ever bought . my four year old wanted it very badly christmas extremely disappointed when it didn't work . we let him dip marshmallows chocolate syrup then threw whole mess away . i think twice before spending my money this company again .	-1

our daughter received this christmas 2005 , we couldn't wait open it her . it very easy assemble , first time you write board it great . when you try erase your art , it won't erase ! magnetic board cheaply made , absolutely not completely erase , no matter how many times you swipe eraser bar . we very disappointed this item , would recommend if you considering this toy your child , you should pass . get them magna doodle instead , those work wonderfully	1
one my 4th graders gave me this game christmas play my 3-yr-old son . i bit apprehensive because i thought my son too young play this type game . boy , i wrong ! we play this every afternoon after school , several times weekend . some verb cards more difficult , but he learning we go what things how best " show " what they . i highly recommend this game plan buying several upcoming birthdays	1
we bought this game five years ago our then 3 yr old son . not only it his favorite game , but it now favorite game his little brother , who four . fact , he even plays it his imaginary friend ! game basically charades kids who can't read yet . it relatively non competitive . each turn , player spins spinner , advances number spaces colored spot board , draws card same color , then act out whatever picture card ( bird , flower ... ) . it great fun play your child -- hilarious what they come up " act out " their turn . ( imagine 3 yr old acting out refrigerator ! ) frequently we cheat look card while they acting , make sure we figure out what they doing . our whole family enjoys playing this little ones	1

anyone who seen these trains display bookstore or toy store probably realized their durability . they hold up , kids ( all ages ! ) love them , even parents too ! feature i like -- names written bottom ( my kids just couldn't believe i hadn't memorized trains ' names like they ! now i just lift train up ! ) . they cute , kids act out storylines books or movies , they going last long time -- most likely passed down next generation	1
my son big fan thomas tank engine friends . his favorite percy . he takes his percy trains him wherever he goes ( bed , car , around house , etc . ) . we even bought extra him just case he loses one them . if your children love thomas ( what toddler doesn't ? ) , i piece advice -- get duplicates trains . you never know if one get lost , or forgotten ! i got doubles most trains , percy included , it real lifesaver when one gets lost or left behind	1
our daughter loves play dress up . i bought these $5.00 clearance bought extra other little girls we know like dress up also . ours not smell ... but i know skunky smell some reviewers mentioned but happy meal toys mcdonalds . we getting lot enjoyment out ours ... no smells !!	1

game pretty good , but kid , competition basicly who could read faster . questions apear screen they don't read it out loud . i played my friends i thought i going great because i watch spongebob 24/7 but my friends beat me because they read faster answered question first .	1
my entire family loves this game . every answer actual clip episode , not dry text answer . eventually you start see repeat questions , but doesn't happen long while . game mechanics quite simple which fine -- fun answering questions anyway . we played this lot , kids usually beat grownups	1
we pleasure playing record 80's-90 some family friends . we played using teams try pool our knowledge . packaging graphics very well . it double-necked guitar game path covered 80's-90 images . you feel like you've gone back time . multiple choice format very helpful some our memories aren't what they used . one teams chose not use multiple choice answers their turns extra challenge . categories " 80 " , " 90 " , " mosh pit " , " you're stage " toughest ones , " one hit wonder " " real name " . we fun because game requires mix luck skill . questions range easy very difficult , so there something everybody . nobody felt left out ! we played three times night averaging 45-50 minutes per game ( alot singing air guitar thrown ) . our place rockin ' we can't wait play again . we highly recommend this game !!	1
my 3 1/2 month old son just starting smile , but he doesn't smile most toys . this changing table mobile main exception . he absolutely beams when he sees it dangling above his changing table , he used hate getting changed there . he even coos giggles lion . i would love bring it us everywhere ... lion must magical him ! plus , it doesn't need batteries ... yay !	1
i love this product . we bought it our 2 1/2 year old i looking way integrate academic learning into our daily routine . i didn't want make up alphabet cards or cut-out stencils hard time finding all-in-one , customizable product could help me teach her everything . when i found this , i overjoyed . it so much fun . desk comes my first leap pad , product well-reviewed its own right , great leap pad book many activities , playable piano keyboard interactive alphabet games deductive reasoning exercises . i sure book would lacking some way , sort built incentive buy more books ( this one those toys demands new cartridge/book accessory when your child gets bored ) , but this not so . all games endlessly re-playable played variety ways . this one book attempts comprehensive introduction system - it teaches math , reading , logic/reasoning , narrative structure , music , encourages creativity . even though i bought pack 6 extra different books e-bay , i haven't opened any yet . desk itself more than simple gimmick which store leap pad . it comes great set 4 shape-stamps , stamp pad paper stamp , full set traceable letter-stencils ( thick durable plastic ) , three different ' creativity sets ' let your child paint , marker draw while learning write letters numbers , recognize draw shapes ( among other things , i think ) . we only opened one so far , she loves it . alphabet creativity pack comes magic erase markers you use trace out letters color pictures illustrate use each letter . you erase re-trace forever onto little alphabet book , which great . i hate activity books single use because they not allow children practice same skill repeatedly . i also love this product looks so great kid room , furniture . it makes my kid feel extra-big her own desk ' work ' , makes it easier her pay attention games/activities than if we just sitting around . alternatively , leap pad itself entirely portable , taken played anywhere . if you cannot find this product ( look e-bay , that where i found mine ) , then purchase my first leap pad instead . however , this desk great value really enhances what leap pad itself . i highly recommend it .	1

i got this my 2 year old daughter christmas she loves it ! we're working her playing " rules " but we also made up other games it . she loves setting everything up " picnic blanket " . fun game toddlers	1
we got this my little sister who 6 christmas . she soo happy get one , so i because i forced share my ipod her car or any other time she spotted me using it . it comes two stories 6 songs . pros : volume !! my parents originally thought getting her ipod shuffle but after i pointed out she abuses volume control mine , ( turns it up too loud)getting her own wouldn't good idea . volume goes high enough car rides safe enough home use well . it doesn't seem eat up batteries either . we're just now replace them , but then again she forgets bring it car only uses it seperatly sold stereo speakers . it cute , it pink like mine it easy use kids who can't read yet . cons : softwear bit annoying . you only add songs either purchasing them their website or burning them off cd . this annoying because i couldn't tranfer songs her off my ipod hers without wasting cd . but it wasn't so bad , just annoying . we haven't bought any stories or songs off their site , probably won't . although stories great bedtime ( fp3 stereo)she doesn't care them much since she listens music i get her , she past age " i two cats " ( one songs included ) likes songs more upbeat songs like " brother sale " olsen twins . it alittle bulky . it not so easy her carry player her like i my ipod . headphone very bulky big compared player itself . so even if there time she remembered take it car , it wasn't something could easily tucked away . we're considering buying smaller headphones since volume control doesn't effect headset .	1
i got fp3 player my 5 year old granddaughter because i didn't want her left out able listen music ( her sister got ipod shuffle ) . she loves it ! headset perfect her , controls easy her manage understand . she listen same music her big sister ( age 10 ) . technology isn't only preteens or teenagers . kids smarter these days exposed more technology than ever . they see their parents , siblings , grandparents using computers , mobile phones , ipods , video games . they like cool stuff too ! they shouldn't left out . i only one suggestion . place clip back fp3 player kids clip their clothing instead hanging around their neck . it gets way when they dancing because it flops around !	1
this fp3 player great ! i deleted pre-programmed songs but kept stories . now my 3 year old daughter listen her favorite songs i don't worry whether volume too loud or if it damaged when she drops it . software could better - add songs you cd program copies it there but you can't move music files already your computer . i only added 12 songs approximately 3-4 minutes each but i think i could add almost 3x amount	1
we bought these keys our then 18 month old , when he obsessed keys set my car alarm off one too many times . toy great . key chain big so its easy kids hang onto , buttoms colorful appropriately sized , make honking noises , car starting noises , etc .. they keys metal like , not plastic , so toy feels more realistic . my now 3 year old still plays them still takes them places us . word warning , because these keys not plastic , very careful where your child puts them . we leaving store one day i handed my son his keys , grabbed mine while i putting my purse front seat my son keying up lock back door trying open it . yikes ! these keys scatch , so word warning .	1

we kind surprised see cooler wagon , but its functional saves us lug cooler separately beach , or haul it inside wagon . it big enough hold few bottled waters some ice , or least six pack cans . neat idea . it arrived quickly , all our radio flyer items , amazon padded heck out them when they shipped . none these items breakable , but we appreciate effort	1
this game great multigenerational way fun . we our parents ( 80 ) , our brothers sisters ( 40 50 ) kids ( 11-28 ) playing together . we make teams 3 age groups great time . younger kids really like playing adults all laughing interaction goes it . questions encompass many genres least one person each team know something aboutwe really recommend this ' family ' game !	1

these rings good concept , but weights them aren't heavy enough keep them place . kids swim through them they sort hop current ( kids swimming ) . when i child ... i set just like hula hoops length rope tied small case . case filled sand stayed put you swam through them . my friends i spent hours setting up courses we could race through . this set nice because it fold up fit small mesh bag transporting pool . but , if you your own pool you might want look set like i way back when .......	1

description clearly states size ( 3 inches ) these very detailed attractive collectibles . they're not really playthings , course , since they not articulated , it would nicer if figures series available individually instead pairs so one could buy players one wanted skip others .	1
this little cube perfect starting point anyone fascinated rubik cubes	1
i given fisher-price " doodle pro glow " my son birthday . although concept doodle pro glow unique , product itself fails live up its expectations . pens came our brand new doodle pro used didn't last more than couple days . screen extremely hard clean i resort using window cleaner remove gunk seems get caked . product comes " eraser " which no more than piece cheap dishwashing sponge disintegrates after few wipes ( not mention it doesn't get anything off first place ! ) . eraser shown packaging false advertisement since it not one you get product so fisher price should really change its advertising reflect true product . fisher price always brand i've trusted enjoyed so i very disappointed how shoddy this product . needless say , after couple days i took doodle pro glow my nearest toysrus full refund	-1
we got this bike my 2 1/2 year old it great . he peddle himself learn steer , or i push him make handles stay straight . handle pushed behind tall enough adult , yet if my son wants push , it goes down his size . i like size this xl , regular fold 2 go seemed too small my growing boy . best part if he doesn't want peddle , peddles don't move , so if you're pushing him , his feet don't go unless he wants peddle . overall , great bike learning toddler	1
this bike pretty lame . it would worth money buy one you steer when you control handle . it cheap so it best selling point .	1
my son almost [ ... ] - he loved bike but it took less then 1 weekend handle break off . i thought we just got bad sample so we requested replacement , it took less than 5 minutes this one break . so my son not bike i start looking one last 1 summer least .	-1
i bought this my 18 month old daughter . she loves it , but tendency tip it over when she tries ride it . it much more difficult steer keep upright than her other ride toys , but she learning ! if you nervous mom , wait until your child little older enjoy this , but it soooo cute she really loves compartment ( we call it trunk ) her put stuffed friend come ride	1
parents who judge education systems/software ability keep attention today add children regardless actual educational content may like this . they'll only ones though since there no educational content . " i love birthday parties , yeah " - " they're here , let party begin " - " oink oink " . this all we here these machines when we use them , which isn't often . kids click pictures elicit related often unrelated noises - it . there little actual phonics training . phonics " games " only ask one softball question per minute surrounded lot add attention getting fluff . these entertainment systems , not educational systems . we should note leapfrog brand dvds we not like leappads all . dvds very good . leappads worthless	-1
shiny chrome handle bars cannot tightened properly . result constant misalignment , consistent loosening front wheel assembly . " why my bike break into two pieces , daddy ? " wondered my three year old i tried picking-up bike handle bar	-1
don't fooled description - this trike not come pushbar , nor it appear compatible pushbar . after contacting amazon , they offered let us disassemble it send it back they would send us same model , which doesn't solve our problem . it looks beautiful assembled fairly easily though , if you looking nice trike without pushbar	-1

good challenge my 8 year old put together ... not too difficult frustrating but hard enough make him think bit . he loves star wars so he spent good amount time playing toy after putting it together	1
lets start saying this item over-priced . miss weather very limited . how much better if there : least three pages , many outfits , backgrounds , objects . miss weather dress-up leaves little imagination . this item offers little .	-1
this toy fun ... but bit creepy side . also , it loses its appeal kind fast	1
my 2 year old grandson loves this toy . he plays it himself but much prefers me play him . it well worth money	1
i lot research before purchasing this computer . i read lot rave reviews , but greatly dissapointed ! first it great ( 1 week ) , then we problems , it would show upside down screen , we fixed , then we no keyboard , cd itself worked . i written twice customer service over span 7months i still haven't got response . i would call , but no number their website . go leapster instead , don't waste your money	-1
christmas , my mother bought this keyboard my son . he just few days shy if his first birthday . since he always fascinated mommy daddy their computers we all thought this would good idea . he absolutely fascinated first time we put this front him . i completely agree previous people software comes this basic . it completely age appropriate him since he 1 , but i couldn't imagine 6 months this software keeping him interested slightest . now though , it . we additional software well my only complaint ones overlay i physically tape them keyboard him play them . once he older shouldn't necessary but try explain logic overlay 1 year old not really option .	1
our daughter 16 months old she loves this . we got it because she saw us use computer wanted use ( bang ) computer too . note , you almost definitely want buy some add software go this . software comes keyboard intentionally quite simple . we got " my home " much longer varied animations . nice feature all software comes many different languages . so we could , example , switch it spanish mode help her learn spanish . we so happy this product we thinking buying up lot more their software titles .	1
first time we played this game , when initially going " contestant row " section , it put same prize up , oh , i don't know - maybe 13 out 20 times ? this one most blatant bugs you piece software . fact , i can't even go enough how horrible this - if i could get into negative numbers handing out stars i would . there testing team when this product developed , or they permanently out lunch , playing halo , or both ? would you like know how easy it write code won't show you same product 13 out 20 times when you return contestant row ? it looks something like this : randomizecall contestrow()function contestrow () prize_number = int((100 * rnd ) + 1 ) displayprize(prize_number)end functionfunction displayprize(number ) wscript . echo numberend function doesn't look so big task , it ? if you software developer . if i wrote code like people developed this game i would never sell anything due frequent requests my customers return their money , which leads me believe this product software development perhaps left hands director marketing effort cut costs ? or maybe it janitor ...	-1

what sold today stores colorforms bears little resemblance original colorforms set . original colorforms 5 large pages heavy-duty vinyl shapes spiral binder , each page different color . colorforms stick very well 2 boards included set , children ( adults ! ) spend hours transforming shapes into pictures . original colorforms set pricey but last lot longer than today colorforms ( which seem lose their stickiness after only few uses ) really sparks child imagination .	1

i say if i it over again , i never would let my son see fisher price catalog pick his christmas present . he saw shake go racetrack wanted it mater lightening mcqueen cars immediately . i am not so happy it because it takes lot keep race going . cars don't go more than 3-4 turns around race track before they shaken again then time race over , your wrist hurts . my son only 3 he doesn't know shake it enough so him , it just not fun . he likes it but easily gets discouraged it when he can't make cars go more than one lap , if . i would not recommend this 3-5 yr . olds . maybe older kids , but i wouldn't buy it again . i wish i could get my money back , but box all it wrappings went out christmas wrap trash . not waste your money	-1

my 3 year old daughter playing geotrax last 17 months . she loves them ! far her favorite toy . this city , even though it doesn't typical bells when train drives thru , still her favorite part . maybe it large size , maybe it all little cubby-holes her animals sit watch train go , maybe it crane turns ... she always include this piece when we build layout . we pretty large collection geotrax now - perhaps city better addition once you've already got many other pieces which more interactive train driving thru . only negative comment she ever crane doesn't go down far enough actually drop containers onto train cars . it only goes " middle floor " . i say geotrax extrememly educational toy . it very mathematical put tracks together . last few months , she building her own tracks completely her own . they very simple , but she doing it , it awesome !! we also work together build sometimes very complicated tracks . absolutely great toy great investment . all pieces thrown , dropped , she fallen them , literally not one thing broken .	1

after quickly destroying 4 cell phones dollar store , i bought two these cell phones younger 2 boys our 4 children . i wish i bought one each our children , ages 2-8 . phone allows you record play back short message . we've lots fun getting creative feature . also , 30 seconds after you close phone , it ring back . it makes phone seem more " real " . i originally didn't buy this phone our oldest two girls , ages 6 8 , because i thought maybe it too childish or too drab color them . but , they constantly playing these phones i trying find more locally , but unsuccessful so far . we added stickers personalize phones , so girls could make theirs more " girly " way . i've not seen any other toy cell phone nice this one	1
this third out four cartridges my son . aside freebie comes system , we also winnie pooh finding nemo . my son reallys seems enjoy bob builder , although he get easily confused it sometimes . it usually letters parts . i don't normally supervise him while playing ( how much trouble he get into video game ? ) but he invariably ends up calling me ask help letters sequences , usually things he should know himself . this his favorite , but also hardest one . finding nemo newer , so he hasn't tried all it yet .	1
my son just received this his birthday loves it . he plays it learning colors , patterns , lots other good things preschoolers need know review . definite must bob fan or boy who into tools .	1

this one needs work . we tried , annd tried make this microphone work , it -- minute time . when it falls out you keep starting over again . we returned it . too bad , it fantastic idea if it could only stay connected . our leadpad works fine other books , it just microphone top cartridge makes this invention top heavy so it won't stay	-1
i bought this my cousin daughter 2nd birthday . she seemed really like it . doll very soft , when you press rose her tummy , she lights up . she little bit baby powder scent , but i thought it nice , especially because it helps avoid " plastic " smell some dolls	1
my four-year-old loves her dora castle , magnetic " magic wand " accessories very slick	1
although it supposed three years up , i bought it my daughter first birthday . i figured we could fun it anyway . i couldn't more right . moment she saw it , she only wanted play horse . initially it started me putting her horse helping her rock , however within few months she climbing up down rocking her own . i am not sure if her climbing skills accelerated due horse , but she sure more daring than many her similarly aged friends	1
this game not quite what we expected . steering wheel only part needed . pedals looks . there 30 games all together . some driving games , some shooting games , some puzzle games , some activity games . you probably won't like all games , but there enough there you would probably find several favorites . graphics not like graphics you'd find current-day computer games ... more like tv plug play games made my younger years . my 6-year old loves it ! he very good controlling buttons , but he already experience playing computer games moving things arrow keys keyboard . i see kid who isn't used some difficulty using up/down/right/left button , particularly games where you control your movement precisely avoid falling , missing ball , or caught something . i trouble sometimes myself because it kind touchy button . not all games require you control button really well . my 4-year old really can't play any games well all ... he his reluctant even try . but he enjoy watching my 6 year old play games . i'm bit hooked some games myself ! adults tough time getting comfortable , however , since there not enough space seat steering wheel . i just sit behind straddle sit , putting seat my lap bit reach steering wheel . instructions games lacking quite bit . there 1 instruction sheet summarizes what object game specifies which buttons use game . however , instructions don't go into details game . example , " hero spud " , you collect keys bring them castle without hit pumpkin or bat . you learn-by-doing you make pumpkin disappear momentarily shooting it once . bats require 2 shots go away . example " tricky brick " ... ball ricochets off bunch bricks , you use paddle make it bounce back up hit more bricks without missing it . periocially , symbol floats out bricks . if you catch symbol , something happen , such your paddle get bigger or smaller , you'll get or lose life , ball go faster or slower , etc . instructions don't explain what symbols , so it takes while learn which symbols catch which avoid . despite its drawbacks , we very happy this toy	1
my children ( 36 ) o-o -o-o- o-o -o-o- o-o -o-ve this dvd all games / activities go it ! this their favorite story !! they actually share take turns controller ! this system great because controls simple enough 3-yr-old use ( sometimes he happy just turning page hearing story ) , games reading your own practice engaging enough 6-yr-old . if you read me dvd system , i highly recommend this dvd	1
this read me dvd helps kids letter recognition , matching lower upper case letters together ! it also emphasizes rhyming , which important pre-reading awareness . my daughters i found out chicka chicka boom boom blue clues , so when this showed up christmas morning , they so excited . my almost four-year-old daughter understood how use this toy only minimal instruction me . she watched dvd " read " book her , then she chose play games based book she just read . it very interactive , educational , mesmerizing entertaining . she play this 30 min-1 hour , asking me questions every now then . she likes she controls what happens , whether it just reading or playing games . she asks play this when she wants " big " kid . she thinks she playing video games , just like dad	1
when my son got this his first birthday i didn't think much it because it didn't seem interactive other toys - but six years later we still it number two loving it much number one . this toy outlasted all others - every kid who comes over loves it many their parents gone out purchased it because their kids so much fun it . this won't one those toys you spend lot money then find hidden back closet . it works wide range kids - first they love just banging hammer watching cars spin ; later it fun experiment steps catapult . watching stuff fly through air gave my kids hours fun	1
this great toy . i gave it my daughter 1 year age- too early . i put it away tried again when she almost two . it lots neat little things . bears played alone , or their cars , or play center . lots switches knobs things . she pound too hard play hammer shapes get hammered thru whole , fell down cut her lip , but i can't see how chicco fault . they really make great toys . their activity table ( not electronic one - one train , instead , award winner ) wonderful . this great break fisher price toys	1
my 6 month old loves this , but i very disappointed when i opened box , it lot smaller than i imagined looking picture , maybe they should show picture baby holding it so you see how small it	1
if your child likes playing thomas friends trains , james one main characters series . his 6 wheels not big gordon , yet not small thomas ' , but james just proud who he : red steam engine . he pulls tender full coal , so he won't run out fuel like diesels . james ' personality little snooty , he thinks his jobs most important . eventually , these thoughts land james trouble . rest assured , james always get his work , which why i recommend him your collection	1
my 2 year old son loves his james . he likes him best because bright red color . his thomas tank train set only toy he plays period he plays it everyday . other than thomas trains , he plays outside . when we guests , he takes them all play his train set . any first time buyer thomas trains you notice prices seem high toy this size but you remember these toys not plastic but made solid maple lifetime warranty . people asked me why i buy these trains when they most set not battery powered . reason because it my experience children get pretty bored just watching train go around track . thomas tank trains your little loved one gets actually participate moving trains . all trains different colors , numbers names which help promote memory skills recognition while fun . thomas tank engine books dvd teach lessons morals hard work , kindness , accepting responsibility , etc , etc , etc ...... your child ages they begin build their own track layouts so toy grows them . makers this series also included items series good people tighter budget . if your child likes trains but you can't buy full track set , you always buy play mat track printed them or you get thomas tank engine felt boards stick-ups . i hope this review helps !!!!!!	1
my daughter loves this few months now . she started playing just little crinkly toys 6 months , now 11 months she loves pulling buckets apart chewing tails . this toy great it teaches putting things out , soft , lots thinks chew , lots textures - overall great find	1

i really happy when i finally found them . we bought chicco flip'n'play earlier , which comes 14 great chicco blocks , all different shapes my 9 months old loved play them - we built all kind things together . i wanted enlarge our options ordered ( waited forever , which not part my product review ! but anyway ) these blocks , assuming they least some different sizes , allowing more creativity , but these 36 pieces only come 3 shapes - 2x2 blocks , 3 pieces 2x6 bridge shape 4 pieces 2x2 angle top ( roofs ) . so i am little disappointed . bag printed some different shapes . but unfortunately , they not there i couldn't find some extension sets other sizes	1
my husband i kind parents used think loud flashy light toys best . these blocks proved us wrong . my husband ordered these blocks last year christmas when he oversees among many other toys . she only nine months so she recieved them so she just held them chewed them . i would stack them her she blast knocking them down . we took them out again when she 1 . she now 17 months hasnt stopped playing them . they come plastic see through backpack storage so she loves put them take them out . she stacks them top each other high she then rolls over laughing after she knocks them down . all those expensive loud flashy toys still sitting there collecting toy dust .	1
i purchased this my son 8th birthday . he delighted . unfortunately excitement quickly faded when we discovered two crown gears not included box . i contacted company they quickly agreed mail these me . two weeks later , geers not arrived . when contacting company again , i told these air mailed day my original contact i would now need contact my " local dealer " . web site provided . unfortunately local dealer full days drive away . this resulted very disappointed boy little confidence company or their customer relations	-1
i surprised how big it , especially since it one smaller ones . but it nice . i'm glad i got my little girl real radio flyer . my daughter only 2 , it huge her , but she'll grow into it , her baby brother get plenty use out it too	1
he loves ducks , so he really enjoyed playing this toy . bal	1
our son started playing it when he 1 . my husband makes amazing things these . even my daughters play them while they otherwise not interested anything not " girlie " . great stuff . only thing it took us while find out superstructs . it used tinkertoys but it discontinued last year ( 2006 ) now sold superstructs .	1
my daughter got this christmas loves it . she takes pony everywhere her . she also loves give pony cup comb her hair . it great alternative baby doll	1
well , bitten strawberry shortcake bug over last few months ( hey , i'm geek . " this girls ' toy " thing doesn't apply name technology ) , my mouth foamed when i saw this item - " i definately mus it , technology sounds so cool " . however , like fisher-price laugh learn learning puppy , this toy wasn't available malaysia either ( fact , only toys i ever saw those little collectible dolls , few other plushes which i regretted not buying . nothing else . those disappeared late too ) . so , i swallowed my pride got it off ebay too . little under rm200 3 weeks later , doll arrived . now , i not saw any these review when i bought mine , but toy arrived fine , working pen all ( tried replacing battery ? ) . so , all systems go . time see this baby sing . my first complaint doll book activity states scan dots order hear entire song . perhaps they should've said " song replayed " instead , because certainly isn't whole song i hear ( watched " meet strawberry shortcake " heard songs their full , completed glory ) . i absolutely loved " friendship grows like flower " , dismayed when song wasn't played completion . neither " strawberry girl strawberry world " , a.k.a " jump clap turn around " . or other songs matter . maybe there some demo tab must removed . but there nothing it manual . box ? i foolishly thrown out box before i chance fully check it . ouch . thing one buttons first activity states scan find out " who baking delicious treat " . scanning it reveals phrase " delicious day " instead . angel cake gain nickname " delicious day " sometime ? other notes toy better . pen kinda interesting me , although activities offered kinda so-and-so , but pen ... well , it scans surface particular color . different color = different reaction . interesting technology . backpack keep pen when not use . ingenious prevents danger leaving pen cabling exposed . thing i've taken like doll " you're my berry best friend " music clip . although short , i actually liked it so much i devised method play song without scanning book all ( scan nearby good-luck bear plush clover activate mode , then carefully scan strawberry hat . any luck clip would start playing ) . other things ? well , book looks kinda sturdy ( my standard ) , pressing her right hand makes her talk , but you already knew . she says couple phrases which seems come random order , but that fine me . nutshell , it nice toy , although it doesn't sing entire song	1
all other reviews i very disappointed . pen attached doll not work book . doll keeps repeating " you play song me ? " my 4 year old daughter very fustrated doll . hardware 1980 not what shown box . i would not waste money this doll .	1
dress up clothes huge hit our home , however box they come way flimsy . i would suggest getting this product but purchasing different trunk hold clothes . trunk lasted less than day ripped apart .	1
these little pokemon figures beautifully made big hit goody bag item my son pokemon birthday party !! fact they came their own little plastic egg made them perfect goody bags extra enticing kids . if it up my son , he would loved keep them all	1
this toy great young child . it works great it really easy control	1
we bought this our son , excited his first remote control car ! however , after month playing it , gears became stripped it wouldn't work anymore . we very disappointed . intention this car wonderful , but when you actually get car , you realize how poorly crafted it . i would not recommend this toy anyone . when you spend money toys , especially toys decent toy manufacturers , you expect quality there . i am sure this tested over period time , so i am sure they knew this car not provide very high quality .	-1
i love dora castle we've lots fun ours . my only issues it dora ( fabric ) dress always falling off ( frustrating my daughter ! ) -- it should just painted or fitted better , this table . my daughter hard time it -- but i'm not sure if it would difficult across board other kids , or just her . so , we still love this , it very cute . one best things castle all sets -- you don't put all stickers yourself ! i've spent many birthday or christmas eve up all night sticking stickers getting angry when one ended up crooked -- so kudos fisher price doing hard work us	1
i bought these blocks my two preschool children 3 years ago . unit blocks wonderful way explore early math concepts because they related size . therefore they stack balance very well . this particular set long thin piece excellent creating bases roofs . this piece doesn't exist other sets i looked . only comment i they made rubber wood so they get little dents them . they not splinter or cause safety issue . enjoy !	1
good selection animals per groupings , wood edges smooth so these wont catch splinters . but magnets not strong enough . pieces fall out i shut each heavy wooden page . it also happens when my child doing so car . we lose quite few way . not great travel puzzle i hoped it would . my 2 yr old toddler loves adding her vocabulary after seeing these colorful animal pieces but its hard keep collection together	1
we puchased this toy our 9-month-old ended up returning it store . concept looks this toy great , but mentioned other reviews , this toy pretty noisy . it so noisy we afraid it could affect our daughter attention or hearing . toy not come volume control , music annoying some people like us . moreover , motor create force blow out balls runs so loud it ruins whole fun intention this toy .	1
we started out magnetix because brand readily available all major stores . my son played it lot i realized we needed more parts . i wasn't thrilled quality magnetix brand . small magnets came out sticks balls became dull very quickly . i $40 into it since most brands not compatible each other , i decide whether it practical start over new brand . after reading reviews i decided geomag . we got huge deal 660 piece set which no longer available . soon i opened set i realized magnetix junk threw them all away . if you serious building large set then forget magnetix . geomag only slightly more expensive , not enough worry . one important note my son plays balls sticks much more than plastic inserts . get some sets inserts , but build it mainly balls sticks .	1
we 2 inflatable convertible chair/sleeping bags our girls ages 5 7 ( 1 nemo 1 tinkerbell ) . we use them regularly . they light so girls move them around take them friends or relatives houses sleep-overs . tinkerbell bag easy inflate cover removable so you toss it into washing machine . it bit struggle get already inflated bag back into cover once it washed since it takes 5-10 minutes inflate bag we don't deflate it after each use . our girls twin beds so we slide inflated sleeping bag under bed until we need it . this storage spot also helps keep all sorts other toys " hiding " under little girls beds too ! most time they convert bed into chair leave it infated their rooms . our girls love play video games use their chairs all time - it great feature . they carry them down playroom or living room ( if i let them ) . even 5 year old convert it bed into chair 1 minute . we very pleased these inflatable chair beds but reason only 4 out 5 stars first tinkerbell bed bad seam would not inflate . we returned it without any problems company sent new replacement which worked fine . box you receive sleeping bag , inflatable bed , pump 1 time mini repair kit ( vinyl patch glue ) . if you plan buy inflatable sleeping bad , then purchase one like this convertible chair feature . it certainly worth it	1
once again , playmobile it ! i love their products . there lot detail imagination put into things they make my son ( almost 6 years old ) loves them ! we now entire pirate collection well few other sets . highly recommended kids handle keep up teeny tiny pieces	1
i've so far put away this toy except shark , i don't feel my four year old son ready all small pieces perhaps till his 5th birthday . shark excellent floats beautifully bath , unlike usual plastic fish sharks we . boat looks good , although i'm not sure i want see all those small pieces going bath . oars very unsteady , so i'm thinking little boat would go well bath itself , leave rest pieces table top play . very cute pirate , i'm sure seagull some words say him	1

this bubble machine great . my 4year old helps fill it , he turns it bubbles every where . even our two dogs get act . it great fun summer time	1
it fun while it lasted , but i hate how poorly toys put together these days . what happened well-constructed american toys ? one thing , it eats up way too many batteries . they should make it run 9v one instead . all those aas cost money ! then after couple months it just stopped working altogether . my husband tried open it up fix it could only get it running again wrapping whole thing up black electrical tape . everytime it stopped working my toddler son i jiggle it just right something connect right again . frustration , frustration . we give up ever getting one these again	-1

this product waste time ! don't bother . handheld game entertaining my daughter , but connecting it online via website frustrating say least ! once connected , we walked around " virtual world " nothing . it too complicated my 8 yr old alone . there much better products out there children similar , but easier play . i would suggest webkinz or neopets . these 2 sites very kid friendly educational games play , unlike muichiz site ! good luck ..	1
don't waste your time this thing until they fix bugs . we bought bratz one it thought it pawz when we took it online . after 10 or so total hours ( yes , i know what i'm doing ) fighting it i gave up took it back . tech support joke . there nothing manual or online help , only link tech support who sends exact same auto response every time , none those responses addresses issue .	-1

first all , stones fit into tube without problem - you only roll sacks up board instead trying fit them all top afterward . i can't compare board ' classic ' version , but i find this one durable convenient . pente become instant favorite , game designer myself , i greatly respect its elegance . if you've never played this game , try it ! rules incredibly simple yet game-play surprisingly rich deep ( much more than checkers but less than chess )	1
i purchased these clubs my son who juggles well balls wanted progress . his 19 took care when he tried use them but they fell apart after 2 months very little use . company completely unsympathetic i would recomend trying more expensive ones or different company	-1
while i am not chemist nor volcano expert , i am certified teacher . this kit provided hours hours quality time my 4 year old , my six year old myself . we measured ingredients , mixed solutions , made predictions , learned vocabulary , discussed results . you think many toys offer all ? i thought booklet contained instructions well-sequenced , simple experiments followed complex ones helpful parent script . there two drawbacks : activities required direct parent involvement sometimes 2 hour wait time required " reactions " happen	1

i'm avid rubik cube player 3x3 model owned my cube nearly two decades . since i solve it under 2 minutes , i decided invest 5x5 bigger challenge . unlike its robust sister ( my 3x3 cube well lubed vaseline , only one re-glued sticker ) , 5x5 proved fragile within first two days . i used careful touch , since i'm very familiar how untried cubes explode . nevertheless , many stickers started peel first day , two center squares completely falling off look non-reparable . i lubed my 5x5 before using it , though it more difficult because squares smaller turns tighter . i also careful turn rows precisely avoid misalignment subsequent explosion . even so , it broke me . it shame , because i really getting into challenge it . now , it just sits like broken toy my desk . $30 or so product , i find this inexcusable . rubik supposed strong brand name i very happy my 3x3 cube . i'll never invest rubik product	-1
my 3 year old daughter huge fan paz she really likes draw , so i figured this no brainer . she enjoy using it , but there some drawbacks . light projector not very bright . if you try use regular printer paper it hard see object illuminated . i haven't tried it yet , but i'm hoping tracing paper work better . other major drawback it collapses easily . order use it , you must lean two sections together . unfortunately they don't lock into each other , they just sort balance each other . so if you try move it or push it little too hard it collapse . even so , she loves draw markers , calling herself " artist " . chalkboard side hit too . overall i would suggest this toy	1

i bought this my 8 year old niece who loves playing school . christmas , it only gift she seemed really excited ! other reviewers said , it should include dry erase marker white board , but my only complaint . age range should also marked older kids . it very nice set	1
my 9 year old daughter this toy 2 years she still plays it regular basis . she her friends play school each other or even their animals . they also sell refill kit when you run out stickers paper . really great value kids who love pretend	1
fact almost all reviews children should tell parents one thing when considering this their child ... this fun it what your children want . imagine great " toy " also " educational tool " . parents children both happy this purchase . my child starting spanish fall ..... this must our household . actually i want fly too !!!! :-) p.s. great tool homeschooling family !!	1
my son ( 6 yrs old)loves these drum sticks . i love them because they off switch . great value your dollar . they noisey , but they drum sticks . no wires attaching sticks . they use batteries . they seem very durable . they also button change sound ex : cymbals button hear beat while you play .	1
rock beat rhythm sticks seem just fun anticipated . they work my children seem enjoy them . unfortunately , this company , music little people not provide good customer service . they sent incorrect item first . then when they contacted they wouldn't ship out correct item until they got first item back . mean time birthday party i ordered these toys come gone . i ordered these over four weeks ago just recieved them . if you want fun toy these might treat .	1
our 5 year old daughter loves it . very easy fun play . great buy	1
we received this game gift i not very happy it we try limit focus vanity our young daughters . said , game gets lot playing time . box says ages 5 up , however much younger children play , bottoming out 3 because choking hazared sized pieces . we change rules so you choose which direction go so game bit more than random spinner game . ( adds tiny bit strategy ) kids off refuse wear earrings because they pinch type ( course ) then just lay them front them . we used sharpies color numbers spinner because they hard see they gray gray	1
this table great . assembly pretty easy . it require you drill nails into plastic which little strange but not hard . table adjust angle kids draw more easily but so far i never put it setting him ( he little over 2 years old ) because it not easy they make it seem . when my son wants draw , there just no time mess setting . one more thing i want mention we table wood floor , bottom slippery wood floor so it slides all over place . so i put some non-skid padding feet make table stay place	1
we got this game when my daughter first grade . she some trouble her homework because worksheets made it difficult her tell difference some coins . she getting frustrated kept saying , " i don't get it . " this game helped her get more comfortable money , value money , counting money .	1
my kids their friends all adore this trampoline . it great indoors rainy days or evenings too . santa brought it christmas this year mom dad put it together . it chalenging job but we it together 45 min . i wouldn't want it myself because it difficult attach elastic cord . like other reviews , you make minor adjustment here there but it no biggie . our complaint whole thing just broke ! friend jumping it who weighs 70lbs . elastic cord pulled apart broke middle her jump . we looking contact info company hoping they replace cord maybe mesh kids jump . riveted holes may too sharp caused elastic cord break ? i gave this product 4 becasue over-all it great kids love it . i hope co . replace parts ! mom 3yr 5 yr old .	1
both my girls love this ( age 2 4 ) . i am getting tired music but they love it ! they spend lots time jumping this - only few mishaps when they jump too out control . handle great balance . when this arrived i put it together it larger than i expected . i able put it together myself . great product kids	1

my daughter 10 years old . she enjoys playing game . graphicsare very good such inexpensive game . i would suggest it anychild ages 4 up	1

i'm not big fan pictionary . however , game , when played lot people good time - fairly fun . so when i heard squint , type pictionary clone , i wasn't too keen getting it . but i knew publisher , out box games , made some incredibly fun games , so i decided give squint try . so squint worth your time ? short answer if you need inexpensive filler , then yes . longer answer follows : first all , short description game play . squint comes 72 small square cards different simple shapes them . these shapes include lines , circles , curves , etc . these cards spread face up all over middle table . each player then takes turn . they draw " squint " card box roll die . die numbers 3 " 1 "' , 2 " 2 "' , 1 " 3 " it . die determines which word card player use , " 1 " easiest word , " 3 " hardest . small timer then flipped over , giving player 45 seconds get other players guess their word . they this arranging picture cards middle table into shape or picture . they may not give verbal clues , but may animate their picture or point part picture . if someone correctly shout out answer , they player making picture both get points indicated die . ( 1 point " 1 " , etc . ) if no one figures out picture before timer finishes , then no points awarded . next player then goes . whenever points awarded , small green chips ( tiddly wink style ) given out points . after each player gone specified number times , game ends person who highest amount points winner ! comments game : 1 ) . components : out box games produces some best components their games . this small game , but stuff inside top notch ! timer nicely colored , very sturdy . picture cards nice shape , quite thick durable . " squint " cards thinner , but only used minimally , so it doesn't matter . die clear numbers written it , easy see . box same size many ootb game boxes , very sturdy , easy fit shelf . all components fit superbly box . only components i wasn't pleased scoring chips . they very small ugly pea-green . they too easy lose , fall floor . i would preferred bigger , easier handle chips . but still , it doesn't really detract game much . 2 ) . rules : all ootb games , rules very short , very easy understand . they 3 pages laminated thick paper , easy read . back page i found quite helpful , it shows picture every picture card . not only this good inventory purposes , but it handy reference when you deciding exactly how build your picture . rules also offer several tips help include game play . 3 ) . ease play : it possible teach this game less than minute . most people familiar pictionary , comparisons evident . people differ picture cards . some ( like me ) like picture cards much better than drawing picture . others would rather draw picture than search through cards make picture predetermined shapes . it all matter personal taste . many " 3 " words also extremely difficult build picture cards . 4 ) . animation : little feature allows you animate your cards not only fun , but very useful ! example , when i make cannonball , show it shooting out cannon , it lot easier others guess it . this my personal favorite part game . 5 ) . playing area : we found this game actually plays very well floor . game name implies , it actually easier see pictures when you squint them . so , if pictures farther down , floor , it actually works better . 6 ) . fun factor : squint fun . we lot fun playing it , moving around picture cards , animating them . i think it price easiness play teach , many enjoy game . however , it lacks certain " zing " i've found other party games , like time up apples apples . people interested playing game when i suggest it , but they don't get excited they other games . squint fun , but not massively fun . however , i still recommend game . it good party game , it really quick play . when you short , fun game pull out , you wonderful little filler game . it not best filler i've played - but it quite functional fun . so try it out see if you like it ! tom vasel " real men play board games .	1
purchased our 3 yr old grandson , usual , you can't beat leap pad system both fun good learning toy	1
i purchased this bear my 3 year old grandson christmas . it absolutely best gift ! gavin listens his bear talk constantly . he loves music also . i read earlier review before my purchase bear not speaking clearly . bear speaks just clear anyone . it my opinion this bear great teaching toy fun also . if i could change one thing bear , it would make it more cuddly easier carry . gina westv	1
i bought this bear number stories my 3.5 year old . she wasn't thrilled it store , but she " issues " animated toys general . i found it amazon half price knew if she gave it chance she'd love it . i right . she likes her alone time i find her listening stories , interacting bear , singing songs her room . she follows books no trouble fitting tjs accessories into his hand her own	1
i bought this my daughter her 15th birthday . she huge elmo fan since we african-american i thought it cute little " black " girl doll love elmo much my daughter . it huge hit she loved it ..	1
this classic game still concept appeal , however cheap materials ruining effect . we played this game kids loads fun . bought it my 4yr old , found game more trying due cheap plastic ants . olden day ants made harder plastic yet still flexible pop . today ants thinner plastic bend more easily , making them get out shape normal pressure then they don't pop up , so game trying . you exert just right amount pressure pop ant not squash him . we tried several occasions different individuals , same results . however , appeal still there , so when my daughter(4 yrs ) who lighter hand makes score when no one else , it immediate delight . but even her lighter touch not sufficient get all ants without ants becoming distorted . i would say toymakers use little more umph plastic ants you'll easily revive classic game . other downfall dog suspenders not fix into box while assembled . so setup takedown required each game	-1
we purchased this my 2yr old 4yr old christmas before reading some reviews amazon . we paid $30 . after reading reviews , i nearly took it back , but figured we'd try it out return it if it seemed bad noted here . i very surprised find , contrary some reviewers , quality just fine . this set made plastic , but it only $35 ! it not most durable thing , kids definitely pull pieces apart . however , during normal use set works beautifully . my boys really enjoyed bowling , my two year old no problem learning how throw ball down alley . automatic ball return really cool , kids aren't dig into unit get ball out . it really encourages them stay right there wait ball get back . floor ( which one reviewer compared garbage bag ) much thicker than i expected . it definitely durable enough last sometime . overall , i'd say price this set well worth it . my boys get plenty entertainment out it . if you get similar deal , i'd go it , especially if you kids want bowl just like their older siblings	1
my son loves bowling . i no idea where he gets , since only time he actually bowling alley his sixth birthday this year -- long after he developed this craze . his favorite computer games " gutterball " " polar bowler " . he makes his own little pins plays tabletop games . i don't pretend understand it . so , when he asked this toy christmas , he weren't surprised . we hesitant buy it , however , because we afraid it would big disappointment . when he made his list santa , this only thing it . this all he talked weeks before holiday . we get it . i'm so glad we ! it great purchase . it easy put together use . sound effects big hit kids -- even our 5-month old loves watch us play . we use this toy reward ; " get ready bed quickly we'll time bowling ! " few complaints : pins pop off occassionally hard rolled ball . luckily they snapped right back . also , ball return fickle , but this probably result our uneven floors , though . this toy takes up quite bit floor space . it not feasible pack it up take it out when you want play . you really need leave it out if you expect it played . although there one-person setting , after initial newness wore off , my son didn't like play it alone . he prefers play it friend or parent . this presents small problem maximum number players play time two . however , there only six frames per game groups kids play " round robin " or " winner stays up " quite easily . bumpers , automatic pin setup ball return make this much fun than old sets we grew up ! we really enjoy this family game . i would recommend it ages 4-9 , older siblings parents fun well . definitely good purchase if you room	1
my 6-year-old daughter absolutely loves this toy ! so my 4-year-old nephew . just couple days , molly wore out first set batteries ; she played it all day ! one caution , though ; don't let controller get wet . my daughter inadvertently got it wet it dry out 24 hours before it would work again . overall , though , excellent toy	1
maestro hulk good figure . i like character am glad he marvel legends style . however , he too short . character 7 feet tall , but doesn't seem like it when you stand him up next bishop , iron fist , or anyone else past series . he same body sculpt used smart hulk back short-lived hulk classics series . so , if you stand him up other hulks , he look just fine . my opinion , if you're going make hulk-or anyone else-make him right size . figure great articulation excellent paint job . joints not too tight well concealed figure . details nice , too . his crown fits his head nicely , but fall off during play . you could secure it one those clear rubber bands come action figures these days . since he possible future hulk , he plenty little warts wrinkles all over his body show effects radiation battle his body endured over years . he comes copy last chapter 4-part captain marvel story . it real recent storyline older kids , so it few , inappropriate 4-letter words it-which i not approve . it sad testament comics these days they resort things like order make their characters plots seem real . they'll whatever it takes get them sell , i guess . i threw comic away keep my kids reading it . comic shows very little maestro hulk anyway . , it kind confusing just pick it up start reading last chapter . you really need preceding 3 comics get benefit story . i think they could picked better comic . this series called apocalypse series because , past series , 6 figures piece 7th , larger figure-apocalypse . apocalypse 5,000 -year-old mutant arch nemesis x-men . he turns out 14 inches tall he looks really , really good when he all assembled . he best one series . most people probably won't consider character selection this series best , so it good idea toybiz release these figures this way . personally , i love character selection idea building , larger figure . they should continue it future releases . everyone want put together their own apocalypse since he very hard get when he made his 6-inch appearance marvel legends 7 . maestro well stocked , so if you want him apocalypse piece or not , you're still getting great action figure who plays displays nicely . but , i only give it 4 stars because he too short inappropriate words comic . they forgot this toy recommended kids young 5 . i don't think most people want their 5 year old reading these kinds words yet .	1
this great product . my son 3 it works very well his motor skills . geo trax played each evening	1
i initially bought this toy work . playdough great fine motor activity used variety ways during therapy sessions kids all ages . course , it found it way into my 2 year olds hands she loves it ! rolling out dough pressing out shapes .. she could this hours . plunger little difficult use little hands , it may cause frustration if there not adult there help . little scissors also big hit great way teach scissor skills . bucket also keeps everything together . if playdough only gets put bucket not their little containers .. it still stays fresh	1
my two year old new fan dora , so i bought her this beach set stocking stuffer . say she loves it would understatement . we many dora toys now , but little dora boots figurines this set particularly loved . what nicest them they small enough her hold one hand , so very portable . they also hard molded plastic , so while they aren't poseable , they also aren't breakable extremely easy clean . she bring them bathtub , bed , play them meals sandbox . i wash them super hot soapy water unlike stuffed toys we own . paint held up well wear . i ended up buying one these sets backup , case one gets lost , different set get tico character	1
i like this pool floatie lot . only thing annoyed me this purchase thru amazon , it doesn't tell you there several different patterns it comes . it only mentioned blue dolphin pattern . i bought this my son we got green one flowers it . quite disappointing	1
i don't consider this toy . it just what i need 1 yr old pool . i using baby carrier . this great	1
this toy absolute junk . purchased 2 boys christmas . one quit working day . amazon amazing replaced it quickly .. but only one side works again . second one drains battery . even tried new battery charger . still drains it matter minutes . it great concept , but not durable all . gears turn " shells " go out quickly . then you left useless toy . tyco should little more product testing before this one put out .	-1

my 6 year old loved it . many games it not enough learning materia	1
like many others , my 3 year old daughter received this christmas . she received castle packaged w/3 bonus ponies . castle feels solid easy her open close . she likes option using wand open castle or pushing button above doors instead . she enjoys putting her ponies or other toys it . i also like she close up many her ponies it evening everything confined into one little space . she even carry it one room way . problems : there really isn't room play castle few small accessories it comes , some accessories very small , magnet dance floor little difficult manuever . none these issues bother my daughter , though . she loves castle , which makes it money well spent	1
castle cheaply made comes so few accesories worthy mention without types accessories would make it something fun play . my daughter hardly even played hers , exception opening closing castle just hear sound ! she also noticed her own apecial " wand " used open castle not like one adverstisement .... " mommy , there no crystal my wand , look ! " also , dance floor so weak it nearly impossible my 5 year old even manuever . definite disappointment $	1
this toy really cool . my 3 1/2 year old daughter got it her pap-pap christmas . only reason i'm not giving it full 5 stars price , $59.95 +tx , it should totally come dinner table , like picture , or free pony . i also wish you didn't push purple platforms top level before closing thing up tight . if you try close it purple platforms protruding , you could break purple platforms . wand idea make it open up into castle excellent concept . my daughter loves her castle . it really really cute . just wish it came more price	1
list price almost $30 . it sale $9.99 amazon . my 5 year old chose this toy online she likes i t.t he crown jewel stickers pretty , but hairclips don't really work . when she runs curling iron through hair nothing happens , because water isn't cold enough turn it pink . ice cubes too big fit curling iron , so i just set cup ice water her dip brush into .	1
my 5 uear old loved it , so her 11 year old sister though she hates admit it . great value fun least hour . it cute accessories shared	1
previously stated , colors not quite right . also , my son wore it only fifteen minuets when we noticed stitching comming apart down back seam . he should least gotten whole halloween worth out it	1
talk your off wall questions you always wondered upon but just never knew answers too twist some question you clue too . it funny hear what people make up spur moment almost scary hear people you know lie so well you believe their very answer if it given fact . its also extremely impressive when you or someone actually knows answer . i played this game group people ranging 41 14 , we all enjoyed it . first time we played we teams , so dont stop up six players , its still just fun group , but diffidently more fun individual . there few times one member group would draw blank even begin answer , first time this happen , player answer " its government conspiracy . " which became running gag when anyone ever drew blank bluff answer . malarky begins question , only one person room correct answer , you dont know whom it till after round ended . you go around table everyone bluffs their way through it correct answer . than all players guess afterwards whom spoke rightful answer ..... than truth comes known who able lie through their teeth ... ha ! points won guessing rightful answer . fun , laugh little , always make time play	1
this game awesome ! i played it some friends now i've looking it everywhere .... i found it here ! it so much fun play . not only you learn your friends actually know weird stuff , you learn weird stuff too !!!!	1
my 11 month old son received this christmas he loves it . he loves watch animals pop up make noises . it fun watch his face light up hear him squeel delight when he hits one buttons animal pops up	1
this one my son favorite toys if not his favorite 5 mos now . when i bought this him he didnt know how pop up bobble heads but didnt matter him because once i showed him how open it he fascinated those little heads . he quickly mastered closing each one . music suprisingly also activated when you hit bobble head well hitting knobs/buttons so he could still enjoy it even if he still learning open it . out all money spent toys this 14.99 toy surpassed my expectations still played every day , several times day	1
who would thought this would hit christmas . lots fun all ages 6 , 8 , 10 , 43 . tons competition lots ways make it more challenging . after two days playing it non-stop , my husband says , " i haven't lost yet ! " i looked 6 , 8 , 10 year old said , " super , honey ! " great game , lots fun	1
i truly enjoy playing this game my 5 year old . she greatly improved her reasoning skills while playing this game asking yes or no questions their physical appearance deduce character my card . it helps her observation skills , it also exposed her pictures people differing ethnicity . allowed us conversation helped me teach her how properly politely describe their appearance , potentially avoiding embarassing episodes down road . you never know what child age say where they say it , so it unexpected benefit this game it lead conversation	1
i got this game my son who just completed kindergarten , begged it . i thought it bit beyond him , he just learned read write this past school year , but he rapidly learning recognize differentiate correct incorrect words , he loves it . i guess lure spiderman makes even spelling fun , reading same story over over .	1

ours never worked . we turn button , giggle , then nothing . little fairy doesn't really play environment much - there not lot it . i'm not sure why this so expensive since it doesn't much but sit there . only thing my daughter found it lose detachable fake leaves . i can't get spokes top stay it either . far , worst toy purchase i've ever made	-1
i almost didn't buy this cotton candy maker because poor reviews but our unit works like dream ! we plugged our unit after pulling it out box , pushed toggle switch , waiting 10 minutes motor warm up , poured teaspoon table sugar into spinner within 30 seconds we cotton candy ! consistancy little heavier than professionally spun cotton candy you'd get fair but i didn't expect much better . spinner shield helps contain mess but you'll still little sugar crystals jump out bowl , i one pop up my eye while we figuring out process . we accidently added sugar before we supposed but it still turned out , so it pretty much fool proof create perfect cotton candy . there some sugar crystals finished cotton candy but not huge amount , it didn't detract magical fluffy candy . my kids sure didn't care , they pulling small handfuls out constantly . machine ran 15 minutes repeated batches made back back . we shut machine off because we'd our fill our sugar high we afraid ask too much this wonder machine . i'd buy this machine again sure know we'll get more than our money out it . we ended up star performing machine first time , unlike other reviewers who tried repeated units find one worked it should . recommended !	1
it great price great find . i love it , i completed my disney cars collection thanks amazon !!	1
i got this my son four year old birthday . he hasn't stopped playing it yet ! he loves it . box little misleading because it says set includes " articulated diego " . i thought it meant diego character included talked . no , computer attached rescue center talks diego voice . not big deal . it great way him express his creative play . little sister sees it dollhouse ..	1

my husband i gave this ( radio flyer wagon ) our almost two-year old grandson christmas this year . his parents probably appreciated pad more than wagon since they don't scramble blankets , ect . when taking him wagon ride . it perfect fit wagon seems very durable .	1
we bought this item our daughter birthday because she loves schoolhouse rock . after opening it playing we discovered it just songs one game ? when you read what offered it says " games " , we only found one whole thing , guess we misunderstood whole principal cartridge . i ended up returning it because if i wanted her watch videos i would buy schoolhouse rock dvd , which we . anyway , thought we should share this because when you read it you expect games songs ?	-1
i think this toy made kids just fun making fun deluxe clothing their chou chou doll aka dolls pretend real people who think thiese dolls real	1
i bought this my little one when she 3 months old help encourage her during tummy time . i wasn't all impressed it after i gotten it out packaging . thing always falls over pull string makes music start mouse go around difficult pull , particularly little hands . now i've attached it side crib she seems like it better . definitely not worth money	1
this best playhut toy .. no poles just flip open fun .. my one year old my 10 month old love this bus ..	1
it great , my kids ( 1 almost 3 ) love it , we took it grandma grandpa ( because it folds absolutely flat takes up no space car ) everyone played bus . it perfect birthday present my nephew ( 5)(because he so much fun it grandma grandpa . ) i continue amazed imagination my kids all places bus goes . yes , it could probably sturdier , but it not ripped or torn . i still wonder , mentioned one review , why we got 2 steering wheels extra toggels exit door back .	1
what great this tunnel you remove segments use it any way you like . right now i removed one segments it attached my daughter playhut , other 2 segments i together single tunnel . material very well made i am confident last until my 5 month old begins play it . my 2 year old loves crawl through this tunnel	1
my daughter got this her 4th birthday , she loves play dolls , especially hair practically learn how cornrow because it . i like it accessories her well . doll closer her skin complexion more realistic her . girls spend lot time dolls i don't want her develop any complexes . i wish there some kind storage unit base head keep track accessories	1
battery received no packing slip , plastic housing onthe battery cracked . my husband fixed battery ( blue plastichousing ) but i feel it should not delivered condition , no " packing slip "	1
our battery quit recharging after year . it very dissappointing charge battery hours then tell your little one it didn't work . it difficult find battery . i thought fisher price 12-volt would work but it not connect . apparently , you buy this brand , which , by-the-way , cost third cost our tractor ! what you ?	-1
this perfect first remote . we got it my son who 2 1/2 yrs old . i think he bit young , probably more suited 3 year old . we great fun it , however . rest our family use it chase twins around they love it . it pretty resilient too . we only one hub cap pop off ( now , isn't realistic ?! ) it easily poped back . it pretty easy batteries too .	1
my son received busy beads pal his 1st birthday , unfortunately 12 months this toy just fails grab his attention . suggested age range 6-18 months so maybe if he got it 6 months it might more interesting him . this stage he more interested sorting things , like blocks etc or colorful sing toys	1
my son always fan blue clues so this natural choice ! not only my 3 1/2 year old son v-smile all figured out - without slightest assistance me or his mom , but he mastered blue clues game plays it constantly . it instant hit !	1
thought price + free shipping one those " too good true " deals , but went against my better judgement ordered it anyways . glad i . sturdy table nice set trains/tracks , but you tell original thomas/brio tracks/pieces better quality ( 4 times price ) . there quite few scratches wood pieces one glued pieces storage box wrong place so i pry it off reglue it order " walls " fit place . also piece table glued piece fell off so i re-glue one too . under product features , it says " rolling storage trundle under table " . there no wheels storage box . playboards 2 holes ( 2 inches diameter ) . i suppose it make it easier pull boards up , but i covered them up because edge risers kept falling holes . all all , good value my 2 year old loves it ... which trumps everything i said above .	1

my 3 year old daughter recieved variety color wonder products gift christmas . we hooked since . we recently lots problem keeping it all paper . since we recieved color wonder it not problem all . they not make any mess outside paper . we tried markers finger paints . i would suggest this product any one small children . they great	1
we purchased this our son christmas so far it hit . he developmental delays so i am always lookout sturdy educational toys him . he loves stack blocks other objects but becomes very frustrated when they fall- this pegboard , pieces fit together so when my son stacks them- they unlikely fall . my 3.5 old also enjoys sorting them color or shape . all around , it nice toy	1
it great skills puzzle ! however , it doesn't fit puzzle holder made same company . all our others this one sits tops . . . rather unfortunate	1
this beautifully made puzzle good challenge 2 year olds . under each piece there picture inside object ( what backpack , what under shirt , etc . ) which extra fun . buttons , laces , zipper large enough little hands . it take some time little ones get hang completing tasks , but it time well spent they'll feel great once they it . wonderful those who beginning want dress themselves ( " i'll it myself ! " they say , right ? ) now , they way practice those skills so they feel successful . highly recommend this	1
i bought this set my 4 year old nephew . my main concern he would get bored it concidering loud flashy toys out there ... but this one stole show . even his 7 year old sister fun playing it . great toy	1
our four-year-old daughter wants horse farm more than anything else christmas . all she talks how santa bring her horse farm . she sooooooooo excited it . we selected breyer paddock pals glamour girls ranch because it looked beautiful picture , because breyer solid reputation building quality toys . tell truth , we excited receive it ourselves . it arrived today , so we decided open box set up farm . that when disappointment struck us . this not standard north pole quality product . simply put , quality this ranch terrible . we able get farm assembled , true pictures web , it look nice . however , getting it point act frustration tested our patience resolve . then , playing it matter entirely . other reviewer commented , windows doors not remain barn all . slightest touch knocks window shutters doors off structure . some doors not want open all without popping off . one door actually not fit . fence ? let just say it wouldn't hold any horses i know - prtend or otherwise . we joked this barn reminds us one those satirical " some assembly required " christmas toys takes forever put together , then falls apart soon someone moves . barn itself " feels " flimsy . it almost feels brittle - it thin brittle plastic . it very cheap ! it doesn't close together evenly or easily . it " snaps " it closes instead smooth motion we expec t.t he horse , girl , stable accessories supplied barn fine , but they aren't anything special . we plan send it back . doing so , we now face daunting dilemma ... we now three days find suitable farm would meet our expectations , more importantly , our daughters ' expectations . obviously , we not recommend this product .	-1
i bought this because kid my grandparents one i would play constantly everytime i visited , age 7 certain i could solve it . i never , eventually it broke , it wasn't until i sitting my work waiting my computer something , i thought i needed something while i waited my computer unfreeze , or network come back online . so i bought rubiks cube , figured it good portable puzzle thats easy store , only one piece . it came display stand , so i keep it displayed next my monitor , co-workers come scramble it hoping i won't able put it back , but i always . like i said its puzzle , but not alot pieces , its portable , so if your taking bus home , you kill time it , then put it back your briefcase , or backpack . i love it haven't gotten sick it yet	1

my family adore peek blocks . nesting blocks latest long line incredible toys , so our expectations quite high . while these toys constructed well , they not , my opinion , peek blocks because they not closed blocks . charm peek blocks you get peek inside sealed blocks . these not sealed blocks . good , but not par other peek block set	1

first magic set my 5 year old , he loves it !! he his friends created magic acts each other laughed all way . tricks easy enough their age try , remember how . directions come pictures , so they figure them out if wording too comlplicated . set itself durable enough fot most tricks over over . blocks take some reshaping rabbit ring trick not really fit right , but overall , good first set . it definately hit rainy sunday !	1
very fun entertaining . our friend son got this birthday present all kids wanted play it . i'll getting one these my kids , x-mas . they'll love it !	1
i needed lightsaber halloween this year . it too late mail order one , so i went mall see who carried them , what they looked like , how they worked . looking anakin ( blue blade ) or mace windu ( purple blade ) models , but only able find darth maul ( red blade ) , darth vader ( red blade ) , luke skywalker ( green blade ) models . fluorescent lighting stores , vader maul blades not very bright actually rather pink looking . green blade luke saber much brighter comparison . volume sound effects seemed louder luke model well . i attribute superior brightness loudness luke model fact it takes 6 aa batteries , rather than 3 like other two models i played . maul also some plastic handle up near blade , which turned me off . luke model all aluminum , turned machined , no plastic except on-off switch . there nice chromed steel belt hook folds handle , but sword so long i doubt you use it actually hang it your belt ( it shame blade isn't removable ) . all electronics triangular cross-sectional plastic carrier batteries , which just slides out when you unscrew end . on-off switch works well , doesn't accidentally turn or off when you don't want it . my main quibble diameter handle near blade : due batteries such it can't fully choke down like real movie prop , section it painted orange rather than brass color , but you can't everything . pictures web obi-wan ( blue blade ) looks very authentic , but it only takes 3 aa batteries , so it might not bright or loud . all models you see electrical " sections " leds blade turned off - they maybe 4 inches long or so each . but scroll pretty fast , so chunkyness isn't too distracting . swoosh sound effect varies sensitivity : sometimes moving handle just little kicks it off , other times swinging it won't produce sound till you stop - but it isn't too bad really . sounds themselves authentic - bit tinny , you might expect small speaker , but well . one three clash sounds played ( choice seems random ) when blade sharply struck ( takes bit too much impact trigger it imo , i worry breaking it ) . like everyone , i wish blade could somehow retract , but it beats me how you could build something would work this well also retract , so it trade-off . overall , i'm happy i able find luke model don't any regrets	1
i got this uniqua doll compliment my niece birthaday some backyardigan dvds . price i pay excellent toy . it small but baby girl doesn't matter !!	1
i ordered 4 cuddle chimps my grandaughters christmas . they arrived few days though we wait until christmas real review i tell you they cute , cuddley love	1
i purchased several furreal toys 3 large , 2 small . they so realistic they always hit christmas -or birthday . however , all three larger toys , one arm doesn't work ' quite ' right due children picking them up kids pick them up ( arm ) . i noticed reviewer mentioned this well . kids fans these particular animals ( bear , koala chimp)and they still love them which why i still buy them ! i able take advantage sales but i don't think reg . $30 price tag necessary .	1
i bought this game my four year old who loves early reader i spy books . i wasn't sure if it something my nine year old might interested playing since he often bored playing games my four old plays . we decided play this game our sunday family game night it huge hit . i very suprised see how much fun my husband game ( he hard please ) . i admit i great time playing well . game play : everyone gets eye spy board takes turns flipping over deck cards . each card there picture each game board . everyone must find which picture they their individual board must ring bell ( included ) when they . fun part everyone continues find their objects yell second , third . each position there points ex . 1st person find object yells first gets 4 points , second gets 3 points etc ., family decides number they reach determine end game . us 30 perfect . we laughed alot during game , especially because my daughter who i afraid might not find many objects quicker than my husband i . it challenging fun , good addition family game collection .	1

i can't say enough these toys ! they so nicely made feel great your hands . small enough carry around big enough little hands . great quality , sturdy superior look . collectors buying these up like hot cakes ebay living proof people willing shell out cash these . especially ones harder find . people written reviews these no stores carry them . they sold out because there rush these toys even before movie release . hopefully time goes if they keep producing them they easier come . that what i am hoping . i don't all characters yet would like least one each my son , maybe even more collecting . good luck your search !	1

those you who new yu-gi-oh tcg , i suggest you start starter ( naturally ! ) , but you'll want get this other structure decks eventually . not only they contain many what we call " staple , " or standard , cards -- which found nearly every deck due their sheer unbridled power -- they built tough ready duel cards work one -- not so starters . unless you're experienced , however , you won't know how use ' em , so start starters . this particular starter deck , " blaze destruction " starter , comes some deadly combos . backfire burns your opponent 500 damage every time he kills off one your flaming beasts ; solar flare dragon burns ' em 500 every turn can't attacked if pyro-type play your side field ; ultimate baseball kid gains 1000 points every pyro-type your side field , possible 4000 points ; infernal flame emperor potential blast every spell or trap your opponent play right into next week upon his very dramatic entrance . really see destructive power this deck possesses , buy one try it out . it good place start if you want get into tournament play -- you won't win any regionals it , granted , but it good place start nonetheless . also check out it brother deck , " fury deep .	-1

i actually bought this expansion kit toysrus , but buy playzone itself amazon , since toysrus discontinuing it , it hard find this product local target stores . this kit great , makes big difference area covered playzone	1
compare shipping rates . you may find it cheaper buy two complete playzone kits rather than buying one playzone several extension kits . i highly recommend combining two playzones so mom dad play their toddler inside . smaller play zones ( any manufacturer ) simply cage-like feel them . i am * guessing * teddy bear sticker not included playzones any longer because they could peeled off , or partially pulled off , just cause problems . i really prefer playzone teddy silhouettes instead stickers	1
my 4 yr . old received this christmas we love it ! it stores easily under his bed . it great play doh ( contains mess nicely keeps play doh smell off our other tables ! ) comes lots cool tools , molds , etc . we put it floor i play play doh both my kids same time . however we also use table so many other activities like paint water books ( those stain easily so it great using surface we don't care staining ) , coloring , more . sometimes i pull it out my 4 yr . old 2 yr . old color table same time . there lots great spots around table keeping crayons pencils rolling away . we small house , so this fabulous toy creating work /play space our kids .	1
great product , play easy everything together you don't search , clean up breeze all you put things back desk pop top back . my 2 1 year old love i	1
this great set ! my son got this his 3rd birthday he his 6 year old sister enjoy it tremendously . they both play together since there so many things . set comes bunch play doh , cutters , stampers , plastic scissors little knife cut play doh . funnest part table top little molds make all sorts fun stuff . it also includes some crayons paper , but i am not really sure why ; they seem out place set . neatest thing this set when they , they use little tool pick up loose play doh pieces put all parts doh back into storage case very easily . this would great any child enjoys play doh , it so many features there fun anyone , more than one child play time . it also lot more space if you want expand buy other play doh toys store them box .	1
it fun because you your own icecream like mcdonald pakage contains mc furry maker , 2 springs mix , 2 flavors , 1 spoon , one cup . only things you need cream , ice , salt , water . i recommend these toy very fun	1
i read some reviews here i think other people just didnt read directions properly . my 3 year old son i make mcflurry all time our machine we love it ! it easy use easy clean-up . we never mess when using this we never gotten water everywhere . also , entire thing plastic able put water so clean-up super easy . this no more difficult than cleaning blender after use . i dont know why there so many negative reviews this- we havent any complaints all . also , you use 3/4 cup cream 1/4 cup mix so i would assume make 1 cup ice cream , which i feel plenty child eat . it not fill up cup entirely but if issue you , i would suggest either you use smaller cup or make 2 packages . super easy use . super easy clean . very yummy . it reminded me ice-cream maker we when i kid . remember kind , you put ice salt then turn crank like 30 minutes . maybe other people arent familiar ice-cream making process but this just like only smaller faster . my opinion , 4 6 minutes not long wait this yummy treat	1
this game fun way introduce geography . manufacture recommends this game 3 up , while amazon states 6 - 9 . our home it enjoy children ages 4 -adult . older children adults get tired bit faster than preschool younger school age children . it easier play game child who read - but even those limited or no read skills fun . game bright colorful . it captures your attention imagination . this game teaches good basic map skills . players state names countries looking them . if they don't know them , they quickly learn recognize them .	1
game rated 8 years above . it would quite impossible most 3-5 year olds play , since reading required . i believe there error amazon age rating . however , my 7 year old i enjoy playing . , after my daughter brought it her 1st grade class , her school teacher asked where she could purchase game , because it fun educational	1
this highest quality play money i've seen . bills more durable than most coins made dense plastic . realism very good educational purposes . my 7 yr . old gets lot use out it	1
i bought this my son when he few months turning 3 . he absolutely fell love . even his older sisters ( 9 7 ) joined fun . it allows children use their creativity imagination . all plastic pieces high quality last . only thing you'll eventually replace play doh once it through enough .	1
i love little people toys their durability their ability keep babies/toddler interested . my twin boys just got this their second birthday they play it all time . they love animals all sounds . they figured out how make farmhouse play all sounds now starting get interested which sound goes which area . i love it educational teach them thigns they need know hit milestones they haven't achieved yet . fun toy	1
this last little people set i purchased my toddler son . he most other " big " sets , didn't this one , so i read reviews decided buy . i say i am little disappointed my version not scarecrow or catapulting bed :( however , i find my son enjoys this toy . he loves place animals their " homes " hear noises they make . he enjoys piling all animals , including farmer , into horse cow stall . cute ! what you get : 1 barn1 farmer1 farmer cart1 horse1 cow1 lamb1 pig1 chicken1 removable rooster top barnfeatures : sounds everywhere ! there sounds each animal wherever animal " home " located ... ie . if you put pig pigpen press lightly , it oink you . course , it also oink if you place horse there , or any other animal , but i figure it great way teach children proper sound each animal makes . farmer bed also makes snoring noise when he sleeping , or rooster call when it time him wake up . there workbench makes sawing noise or hammering noise when pressed also . there merry-go-round front barn produces few songs such " farmer dell " or " old macdonald " when turned . overall , this great little barn , but i'm writing fisher-price tell them they should taken away scarecrow or bed feature because it obviously great feature !	1
we received this christmas gift my daughter when she almost two . we lots fun playing it together , she loves play it her own . however , if it batteries it she just compulsively presses buttons . we took batteries out we see real imaginative play .	1
i am not really complaining but add heading indicated i would receive more than 1 shovel . shovel big sturdy but no " sandbox toy " beside shovel box .	1
my son received this blaster treat he so excited play it . sounds lights terrific ( they're even better when played different room ! ) . i would definitely buy this again	1
i purchased this table chairs my 3 year old twins . just other day some reason one chairs upside down i noticed little plastic plug unscrews comes out . well , i found out chairs filled little sand so way they not tip over anymore . my twins both falling off chairs everytime they would go get them , but now sand holding chair down they little more stable . i hope this helps everyone this set . i am pretty happy this table now	1
purchased this our almost seven year old neice . she one doggy fur real loves it . polar bear makes less motor noises , which good . switch little hard reach , but also means it very well-hidden . child-size fingers get it better than adult-size fingers . some trouble getting it hug function . it think it supposed stretch out its arms ( which it ) then close them into hug ( which it didn't ) . our neice better this stuff than me , so maybe she got it work . everything else -tickling laugh , eating , burp , hunger grunts snoring worked fine . very cute . just remember turn these guys off when you're . otherwise they go into sleep mode , but batteries still gradually drained	1
hi . i'm nine years old i got this toy my birthday . i think it alot fun play . i would recommend this toy all kids who like interactive toys , because it lots neat things . however you should not get fur real friends any young kids . i 5 fur real friends i like collect them	1
this doll great dissapointment . once you take it out box , you find out doll body oddly shaped . half legs fabric , main body too heavy its extremities - doll cannot stand or sit . mine not recognize its cup , it supposed , it really grows too fast into toddler . most times it not respond when you give commands . also it not cute picture . i would not recommend this doll anybody	-1
i love suzie . she best doll i've ever !! suzie comes loads acssesories ! i use them every day ! when i change her diaper i feel like real mom !! she needs lots care love . i tell her my deepest darkest secrets she doesn't tell anyone , not even my best friend !! suzie talks me she plays funnest games me ! i bring her my best friends house she plays suzie much she , my friend wants her really bad ! when she drinks her bottle she makes cute noises ! long you don't press her buttons she absoulutly perfect ! i think everyone should get her ! i love suzie , she part my family !	1

my grandson lego fanatic . correct , starwars lego fanatic . he puts these things together faster than you open box . he loved this one . especially since you make wings move up down finished product so realistic . this came ontime , even though it said it may take longer , great gift	1
this set worth every penny !! if you someone who likes collecting characters , buy this !!! i don't recommend this set kids under 8 years old because this set takes around 38 minutesto make medium difficulty build . other than ... this set off da hook baby !!!	1
this great blaine doll your barbie collection . he much better than cali guy blaines . only bad thing him straight arm body . but i fixed prob swapping his body bent arm ken . now he more posable . add this doll collection today	1

i think it very creative young children . i got it my 5 year old grandchild who wanted it but i think she bit too old fit right vanity but it great each time they take out tool it talks what it used	1
our 4 year old daughter this christmas . so we bought it . it very easy put together . instructions very clear . it only took me 30 minutes or less put together . most time spent looking piece i dropped it rolled away . we also bought accessory set . which adds even more fun vanity . my daughter loves style her hair everybody else who walks into our house . she loves make ariel appear mirrow . only downside i see , they should used ariels voice " little mermaid " . i think my daughter looking forward , but instead we got different voice all together .	1
i bought this toy christmas gift my 18 months old boy based reviews posted other parents . what great toy this ! i pound ball delivered my work immediately opened it . it lot fun play ( even my co-workers played ) . balls little hard pound through first , but after trying couple times , balls went through fine . even my son able pound them no problem . i only wish there extra balls available purchase ( my son already lost two ) . overall , this toy sustain lot abuse , it easy clean keeps kids entertained hours	1
i sent this my daughter my grandson first birthday . she returned it emailed me this comment : quot ; i return pound-a-ball . it looked great , but balls impossible pound through . you couldn't it unless you strength adult . hammer coolest part , but useless getting balls , then when they went down they always took same track didn't really move any other things inside much . quot ; so live learn	1
we bought this our kindergartner who just not remembering how count her " teen " numbers . she our preschooler spent hours it- we counted numbers , guessed what number it , picked our favorite colors ... it bright cheerful gives them big , tangible number hold play . even our " puzzles babies " 7 year old found herself drawn into it we made up game her add subtract numbers it	1
my son received this his 1st birthday instantly loved it ! he loves playing songs , watching train move or just playing animals . he it 3 months so far it very sturdy . no new batteries yet everything still works great despite his battering it !	1
my little boy who 7 months old time received this christmas gift . he totally captivated music animals . he absolutely loves it . , several different tunes , you don't listen same song over over again . great toy !	1
i find it annoying preschoolers so limited what they " supposed " learn know . course , this because parents encouraged teach their toddlers skills required entrance public kindergarten . pre-k screenings across country , 3-4 year olds quizzed basic shapes , colors , whether they recognize their first name , variety other skills deemed " necessary " their local or state board education . while it okay , even necessary point , it also limits free wheeling learning young child mind capable . this puzzle allows little child enquire shapes beyond just square , triangle , rectangle , circle . my little claire loved them tracing . they served race cars . contacts work 100% time ? honest , i can't even tell you ! i not paying attention , i usually there saying shape name , if that what we doing , or if they race cars , saying " vroom " or if we doing colors , saying color name . so -- great puzzle lots shapes , multiple colors . enjoy	1
this great puzzle ! voice speaking names each shape very clear , my 2 year old learning his shapes using it ! puzzle says shape name , then he repeats it . teaches beyond circle , square , triangle ! very good learning tool ! seems durable , batteries lasting quite while .	1
i'm disappointed discover this game too junior myself my friends . question cards experiments way too easy . this game would only interesting somebody third grade or younger . i really hoping somebody invented truly creative game involving science , but this basically something like chutes ladders some very elementary mechanics questions thrown . plus side , game very nicely made cute drawings good artwork . i wish they would make adult version truly creative challenging	1
my almost 3 yr old loves this set . it great quiet activity . there ton beads several laces allowing you make several necklaces . everything fits nicely into storage case .	1
my 3 year old daughter loves this puzzle ! pieces sturdy picture just complicated enough her put together . i think this great puzzle preschoolers .	1
my 3 year old son received this puzzle gift friend he very excited carry it around thomas tin , look picture while he putting it together . great fun	1
we haven't put it up our wall yet , but my son thinks it great . good desig	1
this christmas gift my 8 year old daughter who into absolutely nothing but animals . she absolutely loves it . she turns it every night her our other children go watch it . i even watch it . it two settings . 1 . where it goes through phases moon . i mistaken how this works , i thought it went through phases moon , however , it blinks through them pretty quick . 2 . moon just set single phase moon . i seen them go through both settings , there small remote control child set themselves . only problem remote because its size it get easily misplaced , especially if your kids like mine would lose just anything . my suggestion this would put some velcro back remote stick it somewhere . also it sensor turns off when sun comes up back when sun goes out . it also runs off batteries . ours came cd , which i thought would something they could watch computer , but it isn't it just talking moon . overall it good purchase , i would definitely recommend it child who very hard shop	1
this great idea my 2 kids christmas , i thought . unfortunately giga hassle inflate 15 air chambers took close hour fill . then our first time pushing kids around 2 friends ( only one child time . each kids weight under 80lbs . it rated up 150lbs . ) one air chamber ripped seams . i now giga ball used 1 time duct tape holding one panel together . it ripped 3 four sides holding it together . most chambers held 5 seams . this chamber right one two openings . so my giga ball experience pretty flat	1
my daughter so excited use this toy her friend first warm day spring , but sorely disappointed . it took nearly three hours fill each individual chamber air , time i , her friend go home . if you leave it outside , it gets very grungy it pain clean all grass dirt bug carcasses out crevices . since you can't fit through regular door without deflating it bit , ours wound up mostly outdoors . some chambers leaked went flat . it somewhat fun , although i worried kids would roll over too hard break arm . it hard younger kids push around . my older daughter fun it during raging hurricane , sitting inside hose running . too labor intensive . looked like good idea , but reality pain neck	-1
i got this toy my son when he just mastered sitting up ( 8 months old ) it gave him activity would let him hone skill . he swings ball ( anything else ) little bat loves announcers voice --" it outta here ! " just cracks him up . i recommend it highly . mommy	1
i homeschool my three girls this fun easy way learn locations states . you also learn few fun facts . game says 3rd grade up , but we using it 2nd grade no trouble . it easy set up there only few simple rules . within minutes opening box you learning . fyi : more you need learn states more fun you .	1
this game so much fun , your children won't think they learning they'll want play it all time . because it repetitive easy , children learn fast . i would recomend this game all parent	1
i grew up loving monopoly , still enjoy it occassionally , but adult strategy become painfully obvious . land property , buy it . build houses soon possible . pray dice land right . this edition adds few minor changes completely change stategy winning , while keeping heart game same . if you enjoy board games , this one must	1
i bought this my 15 year old christmas . he didn't want any toys , only $ . i put some gifts under tree , so i chose this figure few others . he really liked it . he set it up immediately display his room . good quality , detailed	1
this horrible product . pieces won't stay together . it would very difficult child put this together without constant adult supervision . product very poor engineering quality control .	-1
not small kids , paint messy . goop good consistency , it would serve science project or so , but not toy	-1
this deck better than kaiba . people usually only buy kaiba deck blue eyes .. but if you want it so bad , buy it seperate . yugi deck actually strategy set . it got assorted variety off all types cards , no , i'm not only saying this because it got stupid axe despair black luster soldier , but because it strategic deck that put together us buy . but don't try using this tournaments because most people know this deck like back their head . wait , people know what back their head looks like ? hang , wait moment while i try andd see back my head .. =	-1
this worth buying go baby alive doll . my daughter loves not only doll , but accessories i purchased	1
my brother purchased this item magic convention , showed it me i one friend mind who kind sense humor . since buying it giving it her , she called saying they ball it . it greatest entertainment there . grown people crazy it . it creates lot laughter . other people wanting borrow it take gatherings/meetings they going entertainment value . you can't keep your hands off it laughter abounds . great , great toy !!! now i think i am going order one myself like my sister . she couldn't resist either	1
this great r/c model ... you need wide open space drive this .... parking lot , basketball court , etc . not driveway or house ... it packs lot speed you need wide open space run . it very responsive , very good proportional controls . no need hop-ups . battery goes 20 minutes full charge . recommend additional battery . i bought 3 , so family i resolve it track not worry bout no point battle !!	1
we bought our son this age 28 months . he'd never lovey or blankie or pacifier or any other those typical comfort things . weird , huh ?? we thought so too . but soon this elmo out box ... he became part family . he ever wants him bath . easy batteries truly adorable toy . it sensors or something so it actually interacts w/ child ... seems like elmo literally talking right you . reasonably priced well worth i	1
i played this my 9 year old daughter , 7 year old son ( who reluctant because it " girly " game , he loved it though wanted play more , but i help him because it requires reading cards play ) , 16 year old son ( who also reluctant -- he won't admit it , but he fun , i'm sure i " force " him play again ! ) it great way get your kids talk each other , laugh joke around , very family oriented . i would highly recommend this family game or game slumber party preteen girls	1
just what we looking . more durable colorful than " disposable " stuff drugstore . this beach set perfect anytime play playground	1
mat entertaining age appropriate . it provided hours pleasure my 21 month old granddaughter her older sister too . it travel-friendly wipes clean . i feel it good value cost item saved other children well . i would definitely purchase this item again gift others	1

planets made sturdy plactic but they not glow long after light turned out - less than 15 minutes . not include sun like some other sets . easy hang	1
my girls loved this doll . it nice her voice sweet not loud others . they try sing together annelise !	1
my daughter recevied this her birthday after i purchased it amazon , i can't tell you how excited she receive it . she plays it constantly , especially when she playing dress-up princess anyhow . i recommend this toy highly . record , she turned 3 her birthday , there no small parts me worry over her choking . most parents , that very important . i know it eases my mind know there really toys like this out there .	1
i didn't any trouble software , my son name list . someone else claimed it doesn't on/off switch , but that not true , it internal box you plug into computer . main problem this toy same problem lot electronic toys . it doesn't really much , nags your child constantly play it . it tell your child when it time lunch or nap or something , but it not like they're going carrying around 24/7 so they're around hear it . mostly what it say " let keep playing , shall we ? squeeze my hand . " then when you , it proclaims it likes same food or animal your child likes . then it asks it hand squeezed again . my son probably little young it , but i can't see him getting all much fun out squeezing teddy bears hand over over listening it electronic yes-man . it not terrible toy but you're probably better off toys engage your child imagination	1
i bought this toy clearance local store around $12 , got it home after reading box , realized i didn't even take it out program it . box flap back lifts up easy access toy , software you use your computer usb cable ! it came equipped everything you need download it ! i pulled cable out , hooked it up toy , turned toy " " position , hooked other end cable up one my pc usb ports , inserted cd rom into drive . software downloaded onscreen directions so easy follow . it took only 15 minutes all get it ready my daughter play . this christmas present , so after i got him programmed , i remember turn him " off " his box so once he wrapped under tree , he wouldn't " talking " , etc . only downfall i mention this toy he only programed 3 songs/stories . you get select up 3 songs/stories software . i wanted 3 songs 3 stories , but choose total 3 alltogether . so i chose two songs , 1 story . but it easy , he ready go ... it bargain me catch him clearance , able program him so easily	1
this one over 30 phonics games little one play . put it front any child 8 or younger they play it . lessons geared toward 6 younger crowd but it great fun anyone . when my son nothing i'll get out one leapfrog books we'll play sound game . this book especially great its letter sounds music . learning last lifetime , so get them started fun friends leap frog .	1
my son 4 finally learned sounds letters this book . characters funny songs so catchy , my son sings letter sound song all time . getting him knowing alphabet song actual sounds letters big leap , but this book really really worked ! i've already bought next 3 phonics books so far , he love them too . he also can't get enough book bob builder , teaching reading comprehension truly fun way he relate . great stuff !	1
harr , landlubbers ! raise mainsail ! hoist mizzen mast ! we're off treasure island mega bloks pyrates ! harrgh ! when i discovered mega bloks producing pirate line , i excited . this definitely something look forward , given mega bloks usual quality attention detail , their pirate islands crews would no doubt absolutely fabulous . well , wait over , pyrates subjected my scrutiny , here result . good news first . check out these minifigs ! this set comes one each type pirate -- sea marauder , privateer , skeleton crew . articulation these guys awesome ! ball joints shoulders hips super posability . legs bend knees , arms bend elbows . head ball joint well . these best minifigs i've ever seen . you pose these guys ways you could only dream posing lego figures . this how all minifigs should . but our good news doesn't end here . detail paint jobs these guys beyond fantastic . detailed outfits , pirate scowls , adventurous facial expressions , texture detail outfits , hats , faces . they're like mini action figures . accessories our three guys include cutlass , pistol , spyglass , ghostly harpoon skeleton , lantern , couple barrels , treasure chest gold . that good news . bad news smugglers fort challenge assemble . there good number large rocky cliff pieces here . i difficulty getting them stick each other . pieces refused grab onto each other . i look underside cliff piece ( where it supposed click onto ) discovered some excess plastic couple little pegs ( which supposed grab onto surface pegs piece ) . excess plastic prevents underside cliff grabbing onto piece . some scissors effort , i able shave just bit this extra plastic off get cliff pieces stick together . however , there just isn't much connecting each piece other begin , so they easily fall apart . it mostly single , flimsy line pegs holding cliffs together . this minimalist building set . assemble some rocky cliff pieces , place few plates trap door across middle , add few stock building blocks good measure , put two walls roofs there give it remote semblance " fort " , slap some ladders there , couple rocks , couple pieces foliage , palm tree , we've got ourselves very mediocre pirate island . behind fort ( i use term loosely ) tall lookout tower . working features include aforementioned trap door , spring-loaded cannon , ... that it . also included rowboat oars shark . durability less than questionable . presuming you're able get this thing built begin , don't expect moving it around much . i lookout tower cliff it built go crashing floor while trying move mine . aside design island rather lackluster ( it could use more foliage , very least ) , design cliff base pieces leaves much desired . let hope mega bloks next attempt pirate island easier get up running better designed . my verdict : one thumb up minifigs , one thumb down smugglers fort . my advice : stick captain cutlass stormstalker , dreadeye phantom , smaller island sets . put together , they enough those cool minifigs keep any pirate captain happy	-1
i bought these 13 year-old christmas . package impossible open . i forgot batteries . when we got batteries , we learned you only play drum one stick , you play cymbals other . so you cannot use them simply drum ! they not work all if you use them tap surface , so you must air drum . also , one two sticks missed every third or fourth beat . this product disappointing it could possibly	-1
when i opened this present , i like " oh great , useless present i never wnat play " well , i opened it up , read simple directions , began making music within next couple minutes . you plug headphones right into it or even plug it into your standard amplifier . i think if you just like playing music toys , then get this . if your actually serious thinking playing drums or whatever , i think you would happy this . even though there only 6 drum sounds , you actually make some serouis music this thing . instead buying $500 electonic drum set , just get these !!! also , since it just classified toy , you would think when you wave stick , sound would come out 10 seconds later or something - well you wrong ! this very very accurate , sound heard soon you wave sticki just think everyone should no these drumsticks amazing , i cant stop playing themnow , stop reading this , scroll up , click " add cart	1
i bought this my cousin who 3 years old . he loves how it talks him . he needs some assistance changing pages , can't figure out games yet , but he learning new words it . i love leappad products used them my children years	1
my daughter 6 leappad books - this only one she doesn't like . i am not sure why , but it just isn't good rest	1
bought this item my granddaughter . sure she love it ... she loves all princess stuff hard time finding this stores .	1
it hard hold his attention . but he loves this cartridge . he watch it 45 minutes straight . , me amazing	1
my 3 year old starting sound out words spell them - all thanks this cartridge . i take lessons he learned use them every day life - this amazing , i believe my son early reader , this giving him amazing boost	1
it doesn't work it states it should . my 6 year old doesn't even try get it work right anymore . christmas we followed directions closely . it doesn't really tell you when you warmer , even when we stood right front it , it didn't say we found it . this waste $30.00 . if your child really wants it , try steer her elsewhere . this not good toy . i suggest game hide seek safari alternative . it works great fun all ages .	-1
when item arrived it much better than anticipated . it super soft very cuddly . i bought it gift almost didn't want give it up	1
this so cute . same idea mr. potato head but more " current " times what kids like . i always love mr. potato head but since my kids enjoy spongebob so much , this perfect ! keep those little pieces together , though	1
i just bought this my birthday i play it lot i like how you change his expresions put gary anywhere . if you like spongebob you'll like this but beware small parts keep them away small children like my brother he almost got hold one	1
i agree person who said it needs cardboard backing or border . since puzzle so large it doesn't interlock , pieces move when my son adds state which makes him angry -- he not yet 3 . i hold down pieces when he adds states if i'm not available help he gets frustrated . addition , because some pieces so large ( oceans texas ) they tend warp more than doug melissa other floor puzzles . puzzle saving grace my son learned all states week	1
i bought this puzzle my 4 year old twin girls . they absolutely love it . pieces cut state lines , which makes this puzzle great learning tool geography . they currently know least dozen state names where they located within continental us . after half dozen times putting this puzzle together using box guide , my daughters able put it together memory . we great conversations each states learn little each one . example , washington state piece picture apple it , so my kids now know washington known its apples . they also understand when i travel where i am going how far i am going relative where we live . i highly recommend this puzzle	1
i'm going get this my nieces . i think comment puzzle not fitting together not proper comment . jigsaw puzzles those which you speaking , because they irregular shapes fit nicely together most cases . puzzles not all jigsaw . just little reminder	1
i'm sad see this toy getting such poor reviews . yes , it say " get out way " " slow down little fella " , but my daughter still loves it . volume control bottom loud louder , that definitely negative me - course it doesn't bother my toddler . but all all , this toy great . it well-loved still works like new . my toddler loves drive , this toy kept her interest over year . just because it not specifically designed education doesn't mean there nothing gained . we make it educational naming animals , shapes , numbers , letters colors toy . we also sing songs " radio " - my child gotten so good it , she hit button rapid succession get song she wants . fun toy	1
terrible . if i'd heard what it said annoying tone it always speaks , i never would bought it . it high quality , it won't break . i've tried . nothing like teaching your kid honk horn obnoxious voice yell " get out way ! " . " slow down little fella .... " why makers assume only boys would play this toy ? don't waste your money .	-1
i guess some these other reviewers got this toy 18 or 19 month old child ... well my mother bought this my 8 month old daughter she loved it day one ! out all christmas presents she received few weeks after getting this toy she only plays this toy . we take it car , we take it when we're visiting course we play it home . she absolutely loves it ! i guess i see where " rudeness " comments come but child this young it still doesn't really matter so maybe you should buy this toy if it younger baby rather than 18 month old .	1
i don't actuelly this set , but i want point out some options possiblities this set . 1 . you could take leaves ( there only 3 them)and realy good if not exellent replica clean x-wing . 2 . leaves tie fighters , bombers or darth vaders tie fighter you could recreate scenes battels both star wars 4 6 . i also want say how much improvment this set over original . first : color it much better . secound : " nose " swept . really missing original . third:it more proportional than original	1

i'm only writing this say my young children love these things great time them they very child friendly . before buying them , i read few places these too difficult children more appropriate adults musical experience . it toy ! if adults fun cool stuff them , great , but they made , sold used toy . why not 5 star rating ? no reason other than it not their favorite toy . :)	1
these markers great . my grandaughter loves them i like them because they don't make too much mess	1
what happened hot wheels tracks ? anyone else remember when you could buy box whole bunch track connectors create your own layouts ? sets available come paltry 2 or 3 yards track maybe bunch hard plastic pieces . only limited number configurations possible .	1
this awesome toy .... this my son very 1st hot wheels toy he loves it . my husband likes it well . :) it very sturdy toy cars fine track . only problem i it where booster batteries , it very light . when cars come around go thru booster , it really shakes moves around lot lifts off ground . it not effect track , but they could make heavier so it not move around floor ....	1
i just came back buying electronic battleship advanced mission game . first , i bought one comes blue box . after five minutes into game , i could see how badly this game . especially annoying voice announcer lets you know if you hit or miss target because not only he sounds awful but also you just cannot understand what he says . therefore , if you playing advanced weapons use tomahawk missile , when game announces spaces you hit missed you not able tell difference two no matter how many times you press repeat button . it so frustrating i immediately packed game went back refund . then i saw electronic battleship advanced mission comes green box i exchanged it one . wow , what difference ! voices , sounds , design , everything just excellent . here what you get this new revised game . remember , it one green box . 1 . original game play bigger grid ( 10 14 ) , salvo mission ( you fire one shot each one your ships still afloat ) target plus one mission , or bonus mission ( you earn extra turn every hit or successful scan until you miss ) . 2 . advanced weapons now used salvo bonus missions . 3 . voice announcer understandable . you no problem whatsoever understanding hits misses . 4 . attack squadron planes now move scan same turn , planes now scan space immediately underneath them . beware anti-aircraft missile battery , only defense against these pesty little creatures . 5 . aircraft carrier missiles eliminated . now attack squadron planes equipped one-time use only missile automatically hits every space where it detects enemy target . it first target found only , then it only scans . 6 . battleship one tomahawk missile hits everything 3 3 square where it lands . now called light missile cruiser two harpoon missiles covers three vertical or horizontal spaces . fast-attack sub two torpedoes travel one side other grid unless it hits target first . sub also scanner tell you enemy ship vicinity but not tell you precise location unlike attack squadron planes . 7 . new design brings game eye level but if you must you place it conventional way . ships redesigned place where you store pegs actually works ( you know , it not open after storage ) . plus pegs not fall grid easily . 8 . new sound effects cool necessary . before sound missile launching hit too confusing . now not only you distinguish two but also there different colored lights indicated launches , scans , hits misses . my opinion , this great upgrade classic game . small screen record your latest moves still necessary . i mean , more than once we found ourselves forgetting what pattern we choose our planes scan repeat button repeats only last sentence said . but until then , enjoy this beautiful impressive electronic battleship . it actually made me remember how i felt around twenty years ago when i got first electronic battleship made . i hope you much fun i then now . bye .	1
i really enjoyed this game first loved playing it our friends . but , after playing 6 games you're . what waste money . you basically get 6 hours playtime total you might well throw game out . big bummer . wish i bought scene it music edition instead ..	1
we really enjoyed playing riff . this real music trivia game , great challenging questions broad range music topics . we played hours , plus we could check inside hard rock vault see some rock roll memorabilia . highly recommend this game ( it also great value money ) . others just riff-offs	1
i bought this game order spend some quality time my family - cottage , sunday evenings . what great investment . best aspects this game it interactive ( players chase each other ) , it very quick learn ( great kids ) , outcome doubt right up until end . adults certainly substitute money tokens ball , kids just happy clobbering their parents or siblings . i highly , highly , recommend this game !!	1
major fun ! this pitching game attaches door interactive play . we hung ours door end hallway . backdrop nicely padded , so far all heavy pitching , there no damage door . led display keeps track strikes balls needs three aaa batteries . game come them but you want extras hand . our son enjoys playing this himself , his dad , grandfather , sisters . i hear lot laughter whenever he playing big boys . seems they like argue umpire calls . great family fun baseball fans .	1
i only got this toy this summer but we enjoyed it . we live river swim it constantly , my son ( 8 1/2 ) i . it so cool see fish lights give enough light see betewwn rocks . it fun . it so far held up well strap pretty durable but seems ealy replace if it break	1
my almost-3-year old daughter loves this toy . she also maid marian set loves 2 princesses ride carriage . she likes putting knight set into horse , she tell they all " go " together , versus her fp house . because my daughter princess fantatic , this set huge hit : especially since cinderella re-released * this * set carriage . who knew 3 year old would know what carriage ball ? i think it delightful she actually pretends go ball carries conversations princesses . imaginative play , i gave this toy 5 star rating . our princess bit well-loved ( some paint missing ) , but who wouldn't after continual living little girl pocket ? definitely recommended toy	1
this fun toy . our 2-year-old son like it , but it doesn't get played very often . fun camera though - when it gets played . ;	1
gorgeous doll . simply stunning . she so beautiful i decided not give it my daughter last christmas instead wait until she older . since she 3 , i decided collect these signature dolls few years present them all her when she 10-12 years old	1
we collect barbies our youngest daughter . we saw this advertised few weeks before christmas $14.99 then didn't see it again until 2 weeks after same price . gorgeous doll , great price quick shipping	1
i very impressed delivery time my order happy product . cost better then other places most stores sold ou	1
my daughter loved these . my only negative battery hard change since screw stripped so easily	1
this pretty nice little game . it keep you busy help pass time . there lot different puzzles , so you never play same one twice . i only draw back i found date depending lighting screen little hard see . overall this fantastic little game	1
i've wanted this while , but thought price bit high . i recently found it sale purchased it i say , even regular price , this fun item . i wasn't disappointed . even easy puzzles little bit challenge ( it definitely ny times ) . mediums ones great brainteasers . i haven't tried difficult ones yet ! two warnings : first , system itself very small . great travel ( fits nicely into small purse ) , but i imagine this would very hard older eyes . my father little difficulty seeing it he just middle-aged . i can't imagine how difficult this might elderly ! second , it doesn't mark which puzzles you've already ( or if it , i haven't figured out how it ) . each time you choose puzzle , you choose numbered list . would nice if it either marked ones you've or random generator . ( 1,000 puzzles choose , i think choosing numbered list eventually chore . ) other than those two things , it great little machine . i'm taking it me my next vacation	1
most reviews similar theme , great product but not exactly intuitive fold up put away . this should help : how fold - http://playhut.com/fold_instructions.phpthe dora hut similar screen room 200-500 series written directions but video only shows how put it up . taking it down watch " hideaway adventure " video watch closely few times . it much smaller but folds exact same way . here link video - http://playhut.com/images/fold/0bf7634b04a5fb7763f45c10fb847973hideaway-folding.wmvworst case scenario - toll free : 888-playhut	1
i bought this my child outdoor birthday party . it unstable . it falls over when kids play inside . it too hot , air not circulate inside . three short horizontal poles which you insert give it structure warped when it outside garden . it hot here but no excuse such poor quality . i am plannng give it away . maybe someone find use it	-1
friends out town introduced us this game , time passes so quickly this game . instuctions little laborious , but once you start playing everyone catches . it strategy game several levels . cards 1 ) pictures merchant ships differing levels loot ( gold pieces ) 2 ) pirate ships various ' power ' levels 3 ) pirate admirals ( trump card , effectively . ) game progresses players attempt capture other players ' merchies maximize gold pieces while trying prevent their own merchies captured . trust me , it fun family . course , everyone talk like pirate .	1
this line figures mcfarlane quite different take classic fairy tales . little red riding hood possibly best bunch . it great looking figure sm style red . she scantily clad dons spike studded boots ; sliced open wolf accessory pretty grusome but all-in-all this one fantastic looking display piece . that point , it display not really toy . red stellar stand-out piece this sadistic set	1
bought this my grandsons christmas . they 6 , they love this toy . it well made toy numerous parts put together many different ways . they love all mega rig toys spend many enjoyable hours playing them	1
my 5 year old son got this santa this year he thrilled it . he asking this months course , we scared it would not live up commercials . we plesantly surprised toy sturdy , easily assembled easy younger kids manipulate . this toy breaks apart into 25 separate pieces so you several different variations theme- it great see my son creativity come out ! plus pieces basically big colorful enough you won't constantly worry pieces lost . i highly recommend this , especially now i see price $[ ... ] less then what we paid	1
tinkerbell uno best game ever !!! i played this last year thanksgiving best time !! gotta love pixie dust protection card . come now , name like , how could this game not great ?!?!?!?	1
we use this timer clean up . it great b/c my kids love race against time they see . we also use it make them brush their teeth more than 30 seconds . i think it little expensive what it thoug	1
time tracker great idea , however , we've found it works best if you program it manually . it works well keeping kids task while eating their breakfast mornings before school timing video game play . i also bought ac adapter , but without batteries it sort flimsy , if you unplug it ( which easy , esp . if kids pick it up ) you reprogram everything . ( it not if it constant use except clock ) we've found since our kids 6 4 concept time foreign , this way it warns them when they minute or so left play it seems cure disappointment turning off t.v. etc ..	1
i purchased this toy my son this afternoon he hasn't kept his hands off it all night . he 3 1/2 loves puzzles computer games . he especially loves it handle looks like briefcase . he trying read directions inside cover tried almost all puzzles so far . i looking purchase extra card sets very soon .	1

mumble adorable , everything i thought he would . i am very satisfied this product	1
i purchased this safe 6 year old boy . it easy him use perfect his age	1

this stuff waste money . it too sticky anything . i threw it all away kids didn't even care . lousy product	-1
purchased it my girls christmas . tough assemble , but smooth ride fits my 8 yr old four yr old comfortably . deep wagon -- big wheels . i plan use it yard work when girls grow out it	1
my kids , ages 3 5 love this puzzle . however , i don't think it challenging ( i.e. it doesn't keep them occupied too long ) but i guess it age thing . highly recommended first puzzle	1
dread pirate ( second edition ) , front porch classics , one most attractive interesting games i've ever come across . it not game casual game-player , but real collector , this game perfect . front porch classics calls its games " coffee table games " , meaning they're attractive enough leave display while they're not played . game not come cardboard box , rather , it beautiful wooden treasure chest . game " board " actually large pirate map , printed piece fabric . each player gets solid metal ship ( which large-about 2 inches tall inch half wide stem stern ! ) which they move around playing board rolling wooden dice or drawing pirate card . object game collect doubloons treasure moving around board , raiding other pirate ships ports . treasures small jewels , much like those which often come mancala sets . doubloons real ( heavy ! ) golden metal coins which look quite like what one might imagine pirates ' booty would actually look like . each player keeps their collected treasures gorgeous velvet bags they play game . addition beautiful fun game , dread pirate also informative . instruction booklet includes excerpts 1691 journal captain arthur howell , each " dread pirate " card lists fun fact pirates . any avid game collector who appreciates attractive games incorporate real materials who enjoys clever strategy games love dread pirate .	1
i very happy service . items i purchased shipped good condition timely fashion . i would highly recommend making purchases through them	1
fun play friends , easy game people pickup you never out game until very end .	1
i'm one weirdos liked rodimus prime . his character depth , arguably most all g1 next star scream . so i buy this figure . excellent . transformation very smooth . acurate alt mode robot mode . love it . definitely worth $10 it'll cost you retail store . look out wild first	1
he voiced judd nelson , replaced optimus prime leader autobots , hated fans , called variety names : hot rod , rodimus prime , rodimus major . through it all though , he still makes one sweet toy longtime transformers collectors blast . since hasbro no longer owns rights name hot rod , rodimus here all his glory this deluxe classic figure , he looks sweet . looking pretty much like futuristic sports car debuted 1986 animated movie , rodimus , previous reviewer already pointed out , surprisingly easy transform back forth vehicle robot . robot form , rodimus looks pretty good well , albeit bit bulkier than he ever cartoon , but that nothing new transformer figures though it ? he comes missle launcher actually shoots easily put his hands . all all , rodimus great transformers toy collectors young old love , he deserves welcome place any collection	1
todd macfarlane it again this awesome tom brady figure . last , new england patriots get respect they deserve this incredible piece work always remind patriots fans their improbable super bowl xxxvi victory ! usual , attention detail amazing . i hope macfarlane consider making figure some other patriots . i think players like troy brown , adam vinateri , ty law lawyer milloy deserve much credit brady their success . thanks todd macfarlane keep up great work	1
if you new bionicle don't many sets , you won't appreciate iruini much . it still great toy it own- poseable , fun build , just looks cool . but if you few other bionicle sets , toa especially , you'll really appreciate this one . while his construction similar toa metru , it little different . most notably , round shield his chest his mask . mask hasn't used before or since , it gold boot ! all his gold pieces welcome new additions my collection . plus , his unique building techniques ( shield his chest , making his staff ) opened up alot ideas me use my other bionicle sets . his rhotuka-disk launching shield my favorite part all . it looks really cool ! it kind hard use it launch disks , so i just use it hold disks . slot holds ( not launches ) his second disk particularly interesting looking . like vent or sorts . clumsyness launcher doesn't take much away set , i don't launch them anyway . launched disks tend dissappear , only end up mangled cat toy pile .	1
i bought toa iruni my self spare allowence money it worth everything it cost . all i see way negatives 1 , spinneres rip cord always seem get lostand never found . 2 , i personoly am geting board toa metru desinge . enouge abuot cons pros . 1 iruni extreamly flexibal all toa . golden chronicle staff tip allown makes it worth measly $9.00 it costs .	1
this bionicle great . there cool peices including sheild fires out spinner . also , toa iruini brand new mask really cool . he also posed bunch ways . this bionicle one two special edition bionicles , so if you collect bionicles , you should get this set . this set definetly worth money	1
tank this small should only used betta fish . any other fish need good filter , heat , oxygenation . still it way small even worth it . my advice you save your money , go buy 10 gallon kit your starter aquarium . then you keep some realy fish . also goldfish should kept least 30 gallon aquarium , so i even if you get 10 gallon , please research fish before you buy them	-1
this very very difficult toy maintain . gravel extremely difficult remove clean without getting cardboard background wet . after one cleaning cardboard background gets wet that end . plastic scratches very easily pieces periscope broke off easily well . goldfish need lots water this doesn't lend itself many types fish . i never such difficult time trying maintain integrity toy while trying keep fish alive tank clean well . not recommended all . save your money " real " tank	-1
our son received video now xp gift , it kept him happy all weekend . he loves he'll able take it car long ( or short ) trips . i love it help our kids not fight backseat . there lots possible pvds we purchase future . much better alternative than our laptop or renting dvd player car or airplane trips . we're thrilled	1
" pistol " pete maravich could not big star n.b.a. he college , but because when he louisiana state university playing his father " press " maravich he greatest scorer all-time . but what made him legendary showman not only he score lot points , inventing ways put ball hoop his way basket , but also he threw passes like he playground . scoring machines not usually dribble behind their back or make passes legs . his day maravich considered hotdog , but he popular hotdog . he also legendary gym rat , who dribbled ball everywhere he went . l.s.u. he scored 43.6 points game freshman team . then he moved varsity over next three seasons he led nation scoring averaging 43.8 , 44.2 , 44.5 points per game . senior he scored 50 points or more ten times . . u . ' 31 games , setting n.c.a.a. records most points ( 1,381 ) highest scoring average single season . 1970 he named college player year , but tigers went nit because they played southeast conference dan issel kentucky wildcats ( remember when only one team conference went n.c.a.a. tournament ) . course maravich holds virtually every major scoring record n.c.a.a. , most career points ( 3,667 ) highest career scoring average ( 44.2 ppg ) , most field goals made ( 1,387 ) attempts ( 3,166 ) , most career 50-point games ( 28 ) . imagine what he would if they three-point shot back then . maravich selected atlanta hawkws 3rd pick 1970 n.b.a. draft ( behind bob lanier rudy tomjanovich ) . he scored 23.2 points his rookie season named n.b.a. all-rookie team . but case college , maravich scored lot points entertained fans , but his teams not win lot games exited quickly playoffs each year . when expansion new orleans jazz created 1974-75 season , they traded maravich bring him back " home " louisiana . but winning new orleans proved even harder than winning atlanta . but he win his only scoring title jazz 1976-77 . then he injured his knee following season when jazz went utah he ended up released finished his career coming off bench boston celtics during larry bird rookie season . maravich averaged over 24 points game his 10-year career , which pretty good until you consider it 20 points less than what he averaged college . maravich elected naismith memorial basketball hall fame 1987 , named nba 50th anniversary all-time team 1996 . but pistol pete died 1988 , suffering heart attack age 40 while playing pickup game gym . this 6-inch ( scale ) figure maravich bringing up ball jazz wearing purple home jersey team . however , if you make effort you find atlanta hawks variation well , but maravich greatest player history new orleans jazz ( karl malone gets greatest franchise history nobody new orleans hornets topped maravich yet ) . figure extremely limited amount articulation , basically neck right bicep , looks like pistol pete whip bounce pass someone . base basketball court , you might find some minor warping top layer . maravich part mcfarlane sports picks nba legends series 1 , which includes basketball hall famers julius erving philadelphia 76ers , larry bird boston celtics , bill walton portland trailblazers , wilt chamberlain philadelphia warriors , willis reed new york knicks . again , aware there some variants out there most these figures : erving net , walton white instead red , reed blue instead white . hopefully future series they continue go even more old school , which would mean not only likes bob cousy elgin baylor , but i think george mikan figure would totally appropriate	1
well , here i am one more dissatisfied customer ! you would think someone singer would read these something it !! " it really sews !

i first skeptical due manufacturer recommended age 18 mo . my daughter big 3 year old ( 41 " tall ) trike perfect her ( its eaven shortest seat position ) . she loves it !! its easy assemble if you experience , otherwise it comes terrible assembly manual instructions barely no pictures guide you . overall good , although no streamers .	1
my daughter got these christmas loves them . when we walk around neighborhood she wears them jumps all way . she 10 usually complains her legs hurting when walking running but not these ! rubber bands brake frequently we need replace them often but shoes came plenty	1
these seemed like such good idea my daughter her best friend actually willing spend their own hard-earned money them . so we bought them i spent hour or so assembling two pairs . within hour we knew they go back . first foremost , girls totally disappointed what they . blame box , it deceptive , but i willing chalk up real world education would let my daughter deal lesson . more disturbing we replace half dozen or more black rubber bands within time , they snapped . now i know why they give you so many , it not just heaviest kids ( who proabably too old toy begin . ) it so every time kids use them adult spend time putting new bands ... until you run out . needless say , they went back same day .	-1
it ok . i thought it would red laser dot coming out . it only makes sounds . they only played it few times . i little disappointed it . ( parent speaking	-1
my kids love this geotrax addition !!! kids love watch trains go through tower activate music . all you push button top when you start play trains light sensor set music trains pass though . after couple minutes no train activity , it turn itself off . only down side would it plus if you lots track it requires some elevation track . so i wouldn't recommend it if you only basic geotrax package .	1
yet great geo trax product . great pricing .. great value ! we love geo traxwe family get down play this product line .. great quality , great pricing , incredable imagination builder ! our little geo city grows grows every gift giving holiday	1
i love cabbage patch babies . i ordered this baby advertised page , thinking it would look just same . it red hair , but not purple outfit different hair style . my daughter personally picked this one out different one sent . i didn't know they send whatever may look similar . baby cute anyway - outfit probably not one i would picked if i saw it store .	1
this great set young experimentor . i bought it my 6 year old who asking chemistry set . it uses items you should already around house , like salt baking soda . they easy experiments . i would recommend this maybe 5-9 . younger ones need parental help , but it fun	1
this toy durable ! it survived my 10 year old son early childhood , now ( so far ) survived my 3 year old daughter attacks . both children love it , but others mentioned , some pieces loose it takes perserverence keep it together . my cure i hide it except trips doctors other appointments . this makes it quot ; specialquot ; toy , it easier keep track parts . many bright pages colors keep their interest , though they love pulling out snap-on pieces , they difficult little one snap . velcro balloons attached my daughter ( mine ) favorite part . buckle too difficult her , but she loves putting her hand glove unzipping lady-bug find quot ; babyquot ; lady bugs . i feel positives far outweigh negatives highly recommend this toy -- after all , if she not losing these pieces under couch , she would losing her barbie car keys , lego pieces , building blocks , lincoln logs ( etc ) under couch	1

this handheld game potential fun yet educational toy young minds but instead , it processes jeopardy quot ; answersquot ; scroll pattern moves quite slowly also provides quot ; questionsquot ; scroll multiple choice selections . device operates off two aa batteries secured backside beneath screwed cover takes eyeglass screwdriver access . i think screw cover great idea kids but wish screw larger size so time isn't lost picking up smaller tool . anticipation great toy entertain road trips but toy just didn't measure up jeopardy name	1

after three years dragons who walk all fours , we get dragon who stands upright . seems kind strange . stendhal one most detailed dragons date , sporting some impressive articulation dragon roar feature . he doesn't light up , but he variety growls roars activated button his chest . he lot articulation . his hind legs ( which he stands ) stiff only move back forth . but it gets much better when we examine his arms head . his arms move back forth , away his body . shoulder joint move two directions . we get two additional points articulation elbows wrists ( his wrists turn addition claws moving back forth ; really nice ! ) . his neck move back forth , his head move all manner directions . always , his jaw opens . his tail flexible super-posability , his towering wings . he also turn waist ( very cool ! ) . my only complaint this guy articulation his stiff hind legs . stendhal mostly dark red black highlights , white claws his feet , silver colored armor . mentioned , detail here better than ever , everything realistic look . armor his left arm different his right arm ( nice touch ! ) , his wings even some pieces armor them . he comes removable piece armor his jaw . i think he looks better without it , but maybe that just me . stendhal one most charismatic dragons i've seen ( it all face eyes ) . this action figure comes almost completely assembled . i just pop his head onto his jaw attach his wings . also included some parts building small tower torch light flag , odaku warrior shield weapon . i very pleased stendhal . he got my recommendation big thumbs up . i like detail articulation , especially movable claws articulated wrists . stendhal great addition any dragons collection fun action figure play around	1

if you're looking hours fun doesn't get " boring " , this game you . okay , enough pitch :) we play lot board games--we're sort fanatics -- usually we get tired game after while . carcassonne unique respect every time you play game , your objectives different ( particularly expansion packs ) so it doesn't get old . family fun almost everyone , carcassonne game engages logic imagination . game last several hours ( depending how many expansion packs you want put into mix ) or you play quick game without losing overall impact or any fun ( which unique board game arena -- where you usually " cut " rules or objectives play quick game ) . this game also unique fact multiple people play -- or just pair people play equally engaging way . there aren't many two player games out there , quite few other games become dull when less than 3-4 people play together . that simply not case here . set itself enviable anyone who basic carcassonne set , or purchased expansion packs seperately , i appreciate everything kept together one neat little box . if you're considering basic carcassonne set , spring " big box " you won't regret it . this would make great gift board game puzzle lovers all ages ( probably 8 or 9 up -- though younger kids love watch " help " ) . it would also unique gift readers fantasy , those good imaginations ( or need little imagination exercise :) . overall , this highly recommended product . fact , i can't think bad thing say it . first time i played it , i hooked . don't say i didn't warn you	1
this set includes all individual expansion sets game carcassonne . this provides two great advantages : price storage . first , i calculated difference list price each expansion set individually " big box " , it comes out 25% savings . ( this not take into account any discounts ) . plus , note these games not sold amazon , but third party resellers not free shipping , so i would add $10 extra shipping , which , if you factor everything , comes out 40% discount buying everything " big box " instead separately . pretty good . second , more importantly me , box single box ( instead 6 different boxes ) it well organized inside . i don't want all clutter 5 or six different packages . this keeps them all together , which nice ! there 5 different storage places box where you put tiles go each expansions . this makes it easy play original game alone , then add expansions you see fit . i never played original game when i bought " big box " , but i decided buy this anyway because all great reviews i read . i am really glad i . i love original game , expansions making it more exciting reinvigorating game play when we add new tiles . pieces ( box ) high quality , this makes games lot more fun look , fun handle . nothing looks poor quality . reason i like this game two players play this game alone , sometimes it hard find games like . you typically two owners game third person who plays less often always disadvantage . also , game doesn't last too long . you not going get bogged down hours , you " get game " before you go bed , or before you go out . note : you also may see some other " carcassonne " games : " carcassonne : castle " , " carcassonne : hunters gatherers " , " carcassonne : city " , " carcassonne ark covenant " . none these games expansion set carcassonne , they each individual standalone games . therefore , don't worry they not included " big box " , because they shouldn't	1

if you know lot trivia you'll like this game because you've got listen clue make decision - fast ! unfortunately people who don't know lot trivia , or who don't want concentrate so hard , make it guessing game/game chance . because every time they hold up their fact/crap sign they 50/50 chance winning . this slows down game such players rarely guess first right so no one gets pick up double chips . play if you're easy going handle both styles player or choose crowd trivia mavens fun out-knowing * stuff * . game takes hour finish , or you could start fewer chips it end soone r.p.s. i would not recommend this game children . it contains lot difficult words , like latin names plants/animals , odd place names , etc . some over-30 crowd game i played couldn't pronounce " catalan " ( language) ! i imagine would frustrating child	1
main tools great my 19 month old plays them daily . nuts , bolts , nails kind useless because they difficult hold work same time .	1
there no equal this game . taboo , outburst , scattergories , password - all good , but this great . minimum 6 people maximum fun . pick creative , smart crowd though . if word quot ; panquot ; then quot ; tinkerbellquot ; job faster than quot ; potquot ; . review below said they couldn't get 1 word 5 very sad . we always start bidding 7 words i've even seen 4 clues 5 words once ! there no board so i throw timer cards my weekend bag everywhere we go case rain/snow . inevitably friend say , quot ; you bring ' words' ? quot	1
warning : not purchase this game unless you willing continue host more parties . your guests request rematch after rematch . we play men vs . women . inevitably there ton laughter . game piques your creativity . time element keeps things moving , so time flies . we never stopped 10-card quot ; officialquot ; win -- it just too much fun	1
when i saw this toy it looked like it would so cute so i bought it my baby . coming sassy , i thought it must good . boy , i disappointed . you pull string , put water , it just sits there string going back . i thought we broken one until i read other reviews they all said same thing . sassy should ashamed putting their good name such poor product . it really isn't even worth 1 star , but you can't give 0 stars . if i could i would definitely give this loser toy 0 stars . how disappointing coming company who won toy awards so many other toys	-1
we bought this our 7 year old son . he wanted something went fast . like most 8 year olds he bit rough his toys , but this proven withstand abuse ! it go fast , sometimes so fast it hard him control , but then it crashes half fun . i highly recommend adding recharagable battery pack , it keeps fun going , charges quickly	1
i'm risk fan , but don't get many opportunities play . i find this version fun fascinating variation . it integrates very well movie theme provides dramatic twist where one side gets automatically take random territories certain point game . ( it order 66 if you remember sw episode iii . ) rules pretty well laid out easy understand if you already know risk rules . all new rules all blue so you skim quickly through them . if you aren't familiar risk , i recommend skipping all blue rules play classic game first . just keep mind it more fun all rules . some new variations original include : 1 . cards special thematic actions you take advantage 2 . powerful anakin cards which become useless republic player after order 66 . 3 . ability turn collected cards space ships lend bonuses your rolls ( instance , roll 8-sided die rather than 6 or re-roll any ones . ) 4 . special thematic characters republic catch ( separatists hide ) earn bonus cards . 5 . dramatic order 66 dynamic which gives seperatists chance convert territories ( armies ) their side . longer they hold out against card advantage republic more damage they . 6 . two player game actually fun unlike most other risk variations . low point star wars risk : clone wars ugly , ugly board . you might expect something gorgeous since it based such visually oriented movie franchise , but board definitely function over form . least it doesn't get way game play . i highly recommend this game risk fans more dramatic shorter variation . after playing few times when everyone gets rules , you might even get game under 3 hours . that very short risk . those who compare variations , i find theme artistry lord rings variation far superior it introduced some game play ideas this game use . however , i find star wars risk : clone wars much more fun overall . i've heard more complicated " hardcore " variations risk like godstorm 2210 a.d. better games , but i haven't played thos e.p.s. review here suggested separatists always win . hasn't my experience i've seen discussions forums opposite situations where republic always wins . it all strategy ... die rolls . :) later this year ( 2006 ) , there supposed risk game based original trilogy star wars movies . i'm very much looking forward	1
this best board game i ever playe	1
this set so cute , so true movie character outfits , etc . box used cinderella room . you close it up velcro flap it even handle . it cardboard box though , handled care . but i always feel these companies never fully test these products before they put them market . both sets shoes not stay , ever . they sort dangle . her two wigs not sit perfectly her head either , they constantly falling off . dressing stand bit clumsy . but ... i guess these things i noticed . my daughter hasn't bothered much , only shoes . canopy bed great though , it her favorite part set . price , i guess you're getting what you pay . i hope they improve way shoes stay , but now , we still continue buy disney princess mini playsets anyway . precious years our little ones into this phase so limited , i guess i'll take shoes don't fit lost few days . we're making memories playing set together , all matters	1
i bought this card shuffler i must say , it a-m-a-z-i-n-g ! i shuffles each deck 4 or 5 times every time it usually works flawlessly . i used it year . when i use it , i use it hours time . 9v battery works long time too . it noisy sometimes , but not often , gets jammed . but overall i give this product 5/5 because it so much better than hand shuffling . course it going noisy jam up time time because it automatic . think it . it shuffles deck card , cards extremely thin sometimes it gonna slip it . but it not big deal . buy this say goodbye manual shuffling forever !!!	1
this game hysterical fun . anyone 12 years old up play it . we play it every chance we get invariably end up laughing our a**es off ! drinking alcohol whilst playing may cause inability finish game due uncontrollable laughter . huge hit everyone we've played . makes charades look like fluffy , boring affair	1

i saw shout movies tv thought it would make fun gift . turns out i right , game fantastic great fun . trivia ranges quotes , movie stills scenes movies . only problem after you play title initial 3 games , disc useless . you see , shout movies gives you 3 games play start . each game same layout rounds , but uses different questions . sure questions different games , but if you replay game , you get same questions answers thus ruining replay factor . $20+ i would expect little more than 3 games . i really like game , but i can't justify spending $20 other discs zero replay	-1

it good toy , but sometimes vowels don't work . even when you enough money buy vowel push " buy " button , it doesn't work . it still fun toy you tote it where ever you go . this not complaint , but when you push volume button , sound , it goes mute instead lowering volume . sometimes it just little too loud .	1
i truly enjoy this handheld game . i find screen bit small my visual capablities this time . it fast accurate . i believe it played more one player , but not time investigate this yet . it capablity using sound or not , which great public settings . there subtotal button so you see how close getting extra points scoring 3 kinds top row . you able see your highest score touch button . this game much more enjoyable playing stratagies i learned over years . again , its great game but hard my vision .	1

these yahtzee jr. games wonderful all ages , including preschoolers just old enough identify pictures count 5 . i owned one several years , i never tire playing it my grandchildren neighbor children . only downside this particular version there more than one disney " character " each side dice , making it more difficult call out exactly which character you trying . all-in-all , this still great game all kids , young old	1

we love this puzzle but it 48-piece puzzle not 100-piece puzzle ... wrong info this site	1
i purchased christmas gift . item arrived timely fashion , well packaged well received . however , i disappointed find it my local store $8.00 cheaper . but there element shopping home .	1
this great product , our family loves it . car seat base work just like real thing . 1 . it heavy duty , this not some cheap piece plastic . my kids could not break it if they tried . 2 . seat pad removable washable , but more importantly it stays when kids play it ! 3 . 5-point harness chest clip let kids buckle up baby doll properly correctly just like any good parents would . harness quality better than most real strollers i seen . 4 . it even comes latch attachment cars car seat anchors . 5 . car seat snaps clicks into place when put into car seat base . hopes this helps , you won't disappointed my daughters love it .	1
although i'd love get my hands transformers i grew up , i feel these new updated versions definitely improved . others mentioned , they much more poseable than i remember them . prime got fully articulated hips , knees , elbows , etc . great keep your hands occupied while long phone calls ..	1
this still bit different than g1 cartoon where smoke stacks shoulders , no wind deflector cover which new all trucks anyway , least not trucks late 80 . but figure very anatomically proportional , joints mostly flexible , so i put it many really cool poses i come up , it would stand sturdily . both guns transformable integrates into truck which very good design touch . g1 robots look better staying transformed modes , but this one way cooler pose your room/cube robot mode . i admit not trailer box/command center like original version bit disappointing , i feel like i'm not getting my money worth :-) some rotating parts distinct clicking sound when moved , makes me reminesce when i played w/ older robots little kid , making my own sound while transforming robots . this might not suitable kids too young because some parts very stiff i afraid if i pull too hard i may break something . make sure you follow manual when transforming , until you routine memorized . overall , this very good toy moderately complex design , definitely keeper collectors	1
this good game plenty re-play value . travel addition small light helps long plane trips . i could quibble ... quality unit isn't great - it hard get pieces out after game little pieces small hard handle get lost . but why quibble ? it small light cheap fun	1
i luv it i just got it yesterday already played it although lil tip- people who cd player-burner computer , dont plug little cord bottom headphone jack if you it top one it works better it anyway i gave it five stars overall because its fun !!	1
this really cool . it bratz stage . it unessisery play but it make it funner . i reccomend this all . it also go bratz rock angels recording studio playset bratz rock angelz band instrumentz playset . rock angelz best all bratz . this completes my collection rock angel bratz . my opinion , this best . you noticed it also most expensive though ? use ebay save $$$ ( hint hint ! ) this not educational all dont worry , it doen't teach music	1
great horse , great toy . i love how horse moves so nicely , my daughter put saddle bridle horse . my only complaint i no idea why they made reins so hard keep . far i tell , they just hang end bridle , every time you move , reins come off . am i missing something ? this one little annoying detail detracts toy , which why i gave it only four stars	1
i got this because my grandchildren always wanting play ceramic manger my mother made . these figures just right size their little hands i still teach them what manger stands hands-on teaching instead always telling them leave it alone because it break . they great time it	1
view master still fun toy all . my daughter loves it . it durable always .	1
i bought 2 plasmacars my lower body disabled grandkids , ages 4 6 christmas . putting them together required hammer intelligence but essentially very straightforward . they portable , easily used very much enjoyed my girl boy grandkids . they unable use their feet so need use their hands locomotion , this perfect their needs . plasmacars also large sturdy enough so bigger kids family also easily use them without destroying them their larger size . so far they durable enough withstand active children , including 3 large boys play . grandma marily	1
i like light side . sith only use their anger . like anakin says episode iii , i see lies jedi . i don't fear sith you . so , i got blue . me my friend fight very fast . just like movies . blue lightsaber very good . you get fine grip it so you battle . it doesn't light up , but it still fun . i looks like anakin lightsaber . fulfill your destiny ! may force you	1
i think this cool . it much more realalistic then electric one since electric one part blade sticking out . thiss one doesnt this one much more fun play because it strong . electric one break so when you fight you hit soft thats not fu	1
my 3 year old got bella cheerleading christmas . she absolutely loves this toy . she now cheerleader loves cheer moves she learning . it first thing she wants when she wakes up last thing before bed . i love watching her learn moves doing cheers . i think this great toy give it highest rating . i wish i could buy cheer outfit girls wear video . would top off whole cheerleading experience	1
my son got this his birthday when he turned 4 . he actually very good it . it helps him gain better control his fine motor skills . unfortunately , my 2 year old daughter thought it looked like fun too . instead trying play game it intended , she decided chew little body part pieces . game rated older children , but 4 seems like ok age start . just beware getting this game if you smaller children around who may try hijack pieces eat them . they dont fit little slots very well once they chewed up	1
first this game downright frustrating maddening anyone any age . little practice strategy though it becomes easier lot more fun . though some pieces still little difficult but not too hard . course comes after playing game several times developing strategies how move pieces within their holes pick them up succesfully . so if you just thinkin you reach just take them out no strategy you wrong . so i difinetly don't recommend this younger kids . my 5 yr old niece only take out 3 pieces 12 which not very fun little kid . so if you're thinking buying this 6yr old kid forget it . i think this game should rated older kids because it too dificult young kids . reason i put two stars educational your kids come up strategies remove pieces successfully . also your kids learn parts anatomy like elbow , knee , shoulder etc . this game fun older kids but younger kids such my niece it may too difficult even several games practice . therefore i would only recommend it older kids adults .	1
my three younger children really enjoyed this game-it easy understand fun play ... there several ways play game so it adds variety also . great homeschooling , also educational game playing .	1

( more so than we expected ) our daughter 6 . she crazy elmo ( so am i , i must admit -- he much better than barney or teletubbies ! ) i know she want hold onto him long time . you find him her bed or floor her sitting or lying top him like pillow . he pretty sturdy . it great , unique present any one who loves elmo . if you want something special really gets wow ! 3 foot elmo your man . i also hunted all over net say this excellent price . don't get him confused really cheapo version fisher price ( fisher price elmo doll so poorly made . it cheap ugly ) gund one made out really nice fabric much bigger . i give this thumbs up all around quality - looks price	1
my daughter received this doll house christmas . my husband i tried unsuccessfully assemble it . this not project beginners ! we now hired someone who hopefully follow directions assemble it . person who bought it thought it came all paint , accessories , etc . it just box full plywood sheets . we very disappointed this product	-1
when it positioned your layout , it makes bright , orange underpass , but using it it intended purpose bit troublesome . little gray cement barrels don't always fall down when you press top , it gets my kids frustrated they bang it several times . also , unless you position cement truck just right minute position , you not going get cement piece into back it , it extremely fine fit . gate arm same used toll booth bridge , it horrible . most time , it doesn't work , rest time , you use extreme pressure your finger ( hard even adult ) get it work . forget your kids enough strength press it . 2 little cement barrels pretty small , bound get lost , then this thing serves no purpose . but , like i said , it looks nice big , orange tunnel !	1
my grand daughter loves her tonka dump truck . she put lot her toys it , then dump them out ... over over !!! truck durable fun . great buy	1
this ball fun . my 7 month old likes watch this thing go . one problem we it though when it lands number 2 , which square , it sometimes gets stuck there can't get moving again it own . you hear it trying go but it can't get off 2 without little help	1
while table looks nice enough yourself favor avoid this . assembly process nightmare you find yourself spending hours just trying get long screws ( there many too so prepared)to fit into nuts you also situate into cheap wooden frame . screws much my shock not thread into supplied nuts you now buried 3/4 inch into frame . no matter how much you turn them tweak nuts inside frame they often fail catch . you find yourself taking whole sides off just because other side would not latch due this . it looks like they packed thing box overlooked assembly process . if you hours nd hours waste this than buy it . product looks decent enough . myself i never saw it . it pieces all over floor nuts bolts everywhere . i could went home depo picked up countless screws slammed thing together somehow but this point i disgusted whole thing . avoid this buy something else	1
i just watch where they playing it , avoid water mess carpet . but they love it . i wish it came color , though . our girls light skin dark eyes hair , so it would nice find doll looks like all these neat things too . because , we don't want blonde looking doll , folks wonder why we bought them black looking doll , cause it darker than " you me " doll toys us , we also bought them	1
if your child enjoys acting out thomas friends series , then they should know emily one friendlier engines . she old-fashioned engine , large inner wheels . she first female steam engine , apart lady , who only appeared thomas magic railroad movie . she given 2 green coaches after saving oliver toad when they stuck tracks . before she her coaches , she borrowed annie clarabelle thomas , which made all other engines sad . emily just released last year " emily new coaches " already , she major role , mainly because thomas friends doesn't show female engines very often . i recommended learning curve sells emily coaches , because i don't think thomas approve emily always taking annie clarabelle	1
we bought blue her friends my dauhgter second birthday . she loves them . she carry them around her . definatley good buy if your child loves blue	1

there 3 new tool tech figures pull string motorized action : billly , jake justice , jack hammer . these new tools replaced heavy , chunky , battery operated powermax tools , but perform same actions , cut down few dollars cost . only downside plastic axe chopping tool very thin , durability becomes question . however , we've it while it keeps working hasn't broke yet . i just don't think it hold up much abuse old powermax tools	1
i am hooked whole shout ... series . it extremely fun play friends family . only downside if you played any other discs , they use same movies , singers , etc all discs . they just use different scenes , etc . but it still good game own .	1
if you're movie buff or just watch lot movies then this game you . best part this game somehow it keeps track score you . it fun , competitive game , extremely portable	1
anagramania , karmel games , fun new twist victorian parlor game which usually called " anagrams " . there three available editions game , junior , intermediate advanced . we found junior good place start get hang game , but quickly stepped up intermediate . i haven't played advanced , but judging difficulty intermediate , i think it probably pretty tough . stefan fatsis book " word freak " , competitive scrabble circuit , he described how expert scrabble players often quiz each other anagrams , giving all letters 15-letter word seeing who unscramble them first . any scrabble player moving into competitive circuit , i recommend this game practicing your anagrams getting hang art unscrambling . this game not just warm-up excersize scrabblers , though , it plenty fun its own ! play junior version your kids practice their spelling get them think words phonemes abstract way . play one tougher editions adult party game intellectual challenge . it very versatile very fun	1
robot i purchased very well made action walking , spinning , shooting very cool ... this very good collectable good price !! i say this my second purchase amazon , nothing but but professional ..... thanks ..	1
snorta fun game if you company outgoing , loud people . if not , everyone just sits around making lackluster animal noises actually sound like animals . overall entertaining party game	1
we pleasantly surprised flat-screen lite brite . my 4-yr-old quite enthralled . it great fine-motor it quite entertaining . complaints : storage drawer works ( barely ) but it sticks - it quite hard open close . i wouldn't surprised if it breaks soon . also , i dismayed templates single-use only . i don't know if i'd purchased it , if i'd known . i assumed they would multi-use . i'd love find some sesame street , dora or backyardigan design sheets out there ! i've hunting around web haven't seen too many interest	1
regards review above , it friggin doll . it cabbage patch kid . they look like cartoon kids anyways . if you wanted realistic asian-looking doll , there plenty them market . i sure hope nobody buys cabbage patch kid doll hoping it'll either 1 ) look like their kid , 2 ) look realistic or 3 ) represent necessarily what people __________ race should look like . if makers cabbage patch kids made kid entirely slanty eyes , i'm sure people would felt it racist . they made it similarly they could others added dark straight hair bit almond shape end eyes , unlike non-asian dolls . little kids love dolls typically regardless what they look like . getting adopted asian child asian doll isn't going get her " touch " her asian culture . i hope you other plans than . comment amazon.com service , i no problem ordering them . i typically get my orders mail earlier than expected . maybe there complications related your order various reasons	1
children really love action . amount track comes wiith set very good opens up new different layouts . smoking train safe . light spray water there no danger harm or fire . children got kick out sprayed water . not enough cause water problems , but it looks good	1

this ride very disappointing ! this gift my son 3 year birthday . his grandparents bought train extra track we set it up surprise his thomas party . we made childsize railroad signs , sir topham hatt harold flying over train track . he own island sodor . but none children party , including my son , could hold down handle keep train moving . couple children got their foot stuck when train would go around turns . huge waste money ! we returned it after 2 weeks aggrivation . it should peddle like other battery power vehicles , he no problem driving his truck he received his 2nd birthday .	-1
i bought it because it sale i thought it would cute party even if it didn't last too long . after reading comments battery getting wet , i put two layers strapping tape over battery compartment keep it dry before i used it first time seeems worked . i put fish pool start pool birthday party my nine year old daughter it big hit . some girls swam around it most evening . they weren't exactly gentle , either . they grabbed it pulled it under several times . they water three hours but next day i realized we didn't get fish out . i found it partially submerged skimmer basket . i shook it out tried it swim event it still swims .	1
i 6 these now they great . kids love swim them but we also use them decoration backyard barbeques . they look real look wonderful pool . great pool toy !	1
this very nice looking sturdy stool . it also very easy put together . i gave it 4 stars because i'm using it wood floor it slips unless i super glue rubber band strips bottom	1

second time , i'll send my husband store get new one ! i wouldn't even bother , but my 2 year old completely enamored this toy . he absolutely loves him . arm movement me not issue ; it no longer sing or talk all . it just makes strange clicking sound when it moves . this 2nd time this happened ! my son extremely upset his beloved " planenman " " broke " " mommy fix . " unfortunately , mommy could not fix ( even though i replaced batteries ) . i wrote hasbro first time it happened , hoping they could offer me solution or some offer replacement . i heard nothing them . so i just my husband pick up one . 2 weeks ago . now , just 30 minutes ago , 2nd spiderman won't sing or talk . i'm my wit end . guess what i'm going ? buy one , bring it home , return defective one new box receipt store ! ( don't worry ; i'll tell them it broken so some other child doesn't get it . ) dishonest ? perhaps little . but so selling defective toys kids ..	1
i purchased itsy bitsy spider man my 15 month old nephew christmas , he loves it . it easy him operate , so he plays spidey songs dances over over . i highly recommend it give it four stars only because it would cooler if there more than two songs . overall , great toy toddler boys	1
my 2-year old grandson delighted spider-man doll he received xmas continues play ( dance ) doll	1
i bought this my grandson . it still working after few uses . it moves around pool cute watch , but that all i say it .	1
it very nice last summer . i put it away after thoroughly drying it out ( 5 other swimways fish ) . this summer when i opened them up put batteries only one worked . others simply dead now trash . if you looking one-season toy , then this fun , but if next summer comes around you probably find they don't work	-1
my daughter received this set christmas gift . i going return it because i already purchased graco set . we decided keep it because we two little girls figured two different patterns would great . i must say , cabbage patch set very well made . quilting design nicely it looks like it going hold up really well . best part it diaper bag . this bag converts into changing pad opening it up . when open , it maintains main pocket everything placed into . this seems logical i know , but graco bag when it opened opens into one flat piece . it not keep any pocket , so whatever bag goes all over place . all all , we one each set my girls love them both . i just think cabbage patch one ( i admit this grudgingly ) little better designed . i highly recommend it . only possible downside older child might find pattern too babyish . us , it great . it greatly increased amount time my girls play their dolls because it gives them way really feel responsible . they understand concept diaper bags , etc . relate . ability take care their babies somehow changed babies toy gets tossed after little playtime into more member family . we can't leave house without them now . anyway , great set ... we love it	1
i really love melissa doug wood puzzles , we own many , so i bought two these boxes order store them better . i didn't realize until it arrived , md chunky piece puzzles not fit due puzzle pieces too thick sitting too close edges puzzle . most puzzles we own chunky piece puzzles , so rather disappointing , but i am sure we aquire many fit years come . now if md made sure all their chunky puzzle pieces sat inch border puzzle , then they would fit , but they not designed way currently - maybe future ! otherwise , great storage solution	1

i played this game few times over years , it fun , but not exactly something i felt compelled own . many years later , i came across jenga again , but this time it combined horror/suspense role-playing game . if you like playing rpgs , but don't like held down stats , die rolls , rules , i'd suggest checking out dread rpg impossible dream ( tiltingatwindmills.net ) . whereas other horror suspense rpgs , you say " my character feeling scared " , dread , you look swaying tower feel scared your character . now jenga game " must-have " my game closet	1
this era mobile psps , x-boxes gamecubes , classic game like jenga not only continues survive , but thrive ! my first experience my 2 nieces . i never seen them before since it always snows mi , we couldn't go out . break awkward silence pass time , my 4 year old pulled this tower fun out . next several hours we played this awsome game bonded each other . it most fun i kids . ok , now specifics . game works first arranging all pieces make tower then making each person pull out one piece time put it top tower . simple huh ? well i said it easy learn but idea select piece pulled out without causing collapse this where men separated boys ( boys usually win ! ) . you actually learn strategize your game pull each piece sequence make your tower taller . each piece made wood right size , finish weight support quite bit weight . if you looking game doesn't entail mindless button pushing or shooting those ugly monstors tv screen , go this one . your kids love it hopefully you too	1

my son got this gift his birthday . parents bought it didn't realize action figures not included . i most area bix box retail places no one sells them . very useless toy without figurines . i am taking one more day look them , if no luck , it boxed up returned . this probably one worst marketing schemes i seen where toys concerned . how crappy sell dueling playset no people duel . very very stupid my opinion .	1

my 2-year old received this present his birthday absolutely loves it ! but so my 5-year old boy so they fight over it . only problem this toy no other cars fit it ... none matchbox cars or any die-cast cars cars ... they always get caught around curves . needless say , 2 cars came product long lost , so it sits shelf unused right now . i just ordered 2 sets replacement cars $4/set [ ... ] . so i look forward both them set cars race down now	1

i bought this toy my 2 grandchildren , ages 3 7 . so far they love it . granted , my 7 yr old barely able fit it it won't long before he outgrows toy ( he wants know why they can't make it bigger ) . my three year old ball , especially " simon says " feature . i agree it not work well carpet . it tends slow down spinning , but all all , both kids love it !	1
smaller size than what i remember one my adult children some 30 years ago . grandkids love interactive game option . 33 year old daughter admitted her sit'n spin one her favorite toys	1
i first purchased havoc heli ( smaller cousin reflex ) very impressed even it limited control ability so i decided purchase reflex . i returned it next day but am still very pleased havoc . neither " real " rc choppers they don't use manipulation angle blades directional control ( not sure what technical term this . ) therefore limited maneuverability . reflex uses main blades hover 2 small fans either side provide directional changes . main problem reflex it always drifts one side ( not related adjusting trim manual states this drifting occur ) if you happen make turn direction unit drifting it sends unit careening out control into nearest obstacle . directional control stick not analog doesn't allow degrees motion but merely on/off click one four directions time making it very difficult control . i would highly recommend havoc heli ( again , smaller cousin reflex ) it great value it low price ( though it takes some getting used ) but those looking more fulfilling ( or outdoor ) rc chopper experience you should go your local hobby shop invest real fully functional rc chopper ( which purchased around $200 all accessories included most shops ) skip reflex heli . it not worth significant price increase over havoc heli .	1
this toy great i love webkinz . when you adopt webkinz you go ww [ ... ] enter code access webkinz world . webkinz world so much fun . you start off 2,000 kinzcash . you get play games earn kinzcash you spend it your pet . everything you need shop . you buy food , clothes , furniture , more ! arcade games so much fun . my favorite candy bash . also you go tournament arena vs other webkinz players . also you answer trivia quizzy question corner . also , there curio shop where you search gems . you also shop there , rare items available there . funnest part i think decorating your house . you also chat friends using kinzchat so no personal information given . then , webkinz newspaper which you read . also , if your pet gets sick or it needs checkup you go clinic . there so much you i can't list it all ! only problem webkinz recently prices going way up they too much money ! i bought my pink poodle 10 dollars march but now same one 30 bucks ! it very unreasonable . so i can't get one because they cost too much . overall , if you get better deal webkinz would great . i bet you or your kid would love it	1

great figure . it huge ! little details pretty sweet megatron gun scope , silencer , arm rest comes off vents prime legs open when he steps stuff . his mouth moves when you push button back his head ! matrix leadership cool well . it heavy too ! good solid construction die-cast parts . even after my 3 year old played it i wasn't too nervous it breaking ( like i would if it plastic ) . robot mode best . great articulation . all five fingers move ... wrist screens pop up megatron grimlock pictures . display stand talks makes classic transforming sound ( it not peter cullen voice exactly but it close enough ) . truck mode step down detail alternators but it still looks like classic truck . spring suspension rubber tires great . amazon best price . like $49.99 + free shipping . that $20 cheaper than anywhere else . it great addition my collection looks great my shelf next my lego yoda statue ( they're same height ! )	1

i originally bought this game something different play our grandchildren , ages 13 - 26 . they loved it couldn't stop talking quelf . they loved randomness game you couldn't predict what you going asked - they loved my version " chicken dance " . this christmas , i gave one game each family we hit christmas .	1
my family concluded our first annual thanksgiving game quelf , i surveyed table . my mother , who turns seventy this year , belt tied around her head ( look like ninja , course ) . my father , seventy-four , sock coming out his shirt collar his shoelaces tied together . my sister , thirty-nine , wearing bike helmet ( card called anything chinstrap ) , her pajama sleeves hung loosely her sides ( card informed her she now " armless " - we roll die her after ) . who these people ? i known them all my life , yet throughout this spirited game i witnessed surprisingly novel actions : my mother pantomiming she wearing flippers snorkel while attacked swarm bees . my father , physician , delivering moving eulogy his fictitious dog " scooter , " who , according instructions card , affinity coleslaw delighted playing large land mammals . never i seen my sister slap herself face , turn me yell " you must not defy king ! " four us agreed we never laughed so hard , or so consistently , we during hour play . i admit , i skeptical before purchase . after reading some reviews viewing pictures box online , it first seemed if quelf some sort wacky game needs certain setting , mood , or substance related enhancement order fully appreciated . this not case . there elements game , such trivia category parts , help quelf maintain its flow keep players grounded authentic board-game style competition ... this game sucks you then absolutely hammers you random acts creativity humor . player age , gender , personality non-factors . quelf uncanny capacity drawing out best ( " best " , i mean ability make other people laugh until they nearly soil themselves ) anyone .	1
i feel this costume overpriced quality . it not just like picture not really good quality . said , my grandson not take it off loves it . i guess what this all . thanks , ruth pose	1

executive summary this game very much like kerplunk old , lot fun . those you who never played any kerplunk simple theme place plastic sticks across game web , dump bunch marbles top web , then start removing sticks one time . obviously , person fewest marbles fall , wins . this newer version kerplunk adds 2nd level placing plastic sticks into yet web . this adds some game , however practice , most marbles not fall until you begin pulling sticks this 2nd level . one comment related my kids . my kids both 5 , they place most sticks holes make web , however web filled , it gets harder harder push them ( plastic sticks need bend if you want all sticks ) - needs big kid help :-) overall , this simply fun game inexpensive price	1
my son got this birthday present . after taking quite while set up , several cheap flimsy sticks breaking , game lasted but few minutes . since no one wanted take time set it up again , it got tossed . save your money ! buy blink !	-1
i love this but it shoots out marble too hard . it bounces offthe track . but its really fun shoot it too hard because you get run after it	1
this toy must !!! my daughter loves it !! we got it her little after her first birthday now year later it still one favorites . i actually bought one each grandparents house !!	1
these great -- fun kids play , easy clean up . absolutely my daughter favorite bath toy ever	1
kid opened it , pulled everything out , completely unimpressed , never play it . this 9-year old boy who likes putting stuff together likes science-kinda stuff , so he target audience this toy . if i guess , i would guess poor packaging put him off . it very bland boring doesn't look like it would fun all , judging box . if it colorful action people pictures , fun set directions , my guess would he would far more interested . it , though , nothing . fair , my coworker recommended this gift item -- he used one kid loved playing it . different strokes , go figure	1
i gave this " paint wild " set my 12 year old daughter . she loved it . she enjoyed painting all horses making them her own . she gave two out gifts family members christmas ornaments . our family loved getting hand painted horse hang their tree . i am looking more kits her paint . they make great birthday presents too ! if your child likes crafts this kit you .	1
i bought this kit my niece who 11 . she really enjoyed painting horses she loves horses crafts , so combination fantastic . i think kit great fun most children , but i little suprised how little there kit . my only complaint these horses very fragile broken easily . she broke one hers why painting it , broke already right out box . i would reccomend you keep mind when purchasing it . make sure kids very careful them , you might want inspect box before giving it them . all all , great craft kit my opinion	-1
this good game husbands wives play team . multiple choice options so " out there " you rarely know answer any way ! you find yourself using logic talking though situations your partner eliminate choices . you don't play teams , but we found fun . we alos altered scoring , because way directions ouline makes quite long game	1
if i could give this zero stars i would -- honestly , it deserves negative amount stars . lots people saying this game bad because many answers cards incorrect . major problem right there ! but regardless , this game terrible anyway . my husband i got it wedding present it highly recommended some friends ours . that last time i'll take their advice sure ! only people who would enjoy this , my opinion , people who enjoy watching paint dry . most boring game world ! all you take turns reading multiple choice questions -- most them aren't even interesting . not waste your money	-1

my family i love play board card games weekly basis . i am always lookout new games play . while barnes noble i found this game 10 bucks it looked fun educational . what i found this most fun card game i played since phase 10 ! anyone children adults play suceed this game . you start picking 5 cards per person . these cards nouns them such " car , boat , woman , spider , church , student , toy , universe " then you play 4 cards middle all players . you must lay card one 4 main cards . card you play either fit or object card middle . example : 4 cards middle " bus , baby , house , car " i " nursery , finger , spiderweb , thief , black hole " my hand . i play " nursery " top " baby " . baby goes into nursery . next card you play ... nursery would fit or card ( church , house , etc , nursery church ) you go until no one play bigger card person who played biggest last card wins hand . kids , this teach them reading , definitions , different meanings same word , you validate why you played card other players they vote whether you play card or not . i so much fun this game you can't help but laugh when other players try validate completely idiotic card ! i recommend this game anyone 8 or older . i definitely keep this game our shelf long time	1
war ring may finest board game i ever owned ( i own many ) . if not , it certainly best war game . it not just tolkien fanatic my talking ; this some most fun unplugged gaming you . this primarily two player game , but up four play . one player/team plays free peoples middle earth ( rohan , gondor , north , elves , dwarves ) , other plays shadow ( sauron , isengard , southrons easterlins ) . there two win : military ring victories . ring victory means free peoples player need get fellowship mordor cast ring into mount doom , or shadow player need get 12 corruption points ring bearers . military victory means you need capture enemy settlements gain victory points ( 10 shadow , 4 free peoples ... it not easy it sounds ! ) . thing i like most this game it stays interesting through whole game . every turn exciting . this due core mechanic . each turn , players roll dice symbols them . each symbol gives player variety options they take die . players take turns choosing actions based what they rolled ( one time , so there hardly any player downtime ) . number options available would overwhelming , but game includes two reference sheets makes things very easy . all options you'd want war game based lotr here . game starts all nine companions fellowship , but you'll able break them up , so they persuade nations free peoples go war . which brings me political track . game starts each nation political position they books . companions activate them , using dice or attacked push them closer war . combat similar risk , but few added twists , such leaders , characters , defending strongholds . there alot going this game , but it all fun . far rules go , there really isn't anything brings game down . odds against free peoples , but it possible win . ( expansion fixes this ) but there flaws production presentation . rulebook itself somewhat confusing . not until you've finished reading it you understand things you read beginning . this cause your first few sessions " feeling it out " experience . pieces problem . all free peoples pieces either blue or grey , all shadow pieces orange . it difficult quick glance tell which piece belongs which nation . add insult injury , there colored borders around each nation , so it make you wonder why ffg just didn't mold them corresponding colored plastic . i ( many other players ) paint their pieces fix this . but again , none flaws found really bring game down long end . game total blast , 2-3 hours it takes just fly . every aspect intensely interesting , fun regardless who wins . aside afore mentioned problems , rest production presentation extremely high ( what else would you expect ffg ? ) tolkien fans , this must buy , but everyone else still find alot enjoy . i love this game , give it highest possible recommendation .	1
my 2 year old got this chirstmas so far so good . its very nice , pretty . its kinda pearly-pretty . plays three songs able just play keys . my 5 year old likes it too	1

we bought this dollhouse ( after much research ) our 3 1/2 year old daughter ! she loves it ! rooms big easy play decor overall adorable !! we knew no furniture available , so we filled it furniture twin time dollhouse ( girls bedroom , office , parent bedroom , living room , family room , laundry room) ! kitchen , nursery playroom already complete ! furniture works perfectly ! our daughter loves sounds when people placed certain chairs . i highly recommend this doll house over twin time doll house !	1

far card games go , this up top far fun goes . couple weeks after my first play i decided i buy my own copy . it good those who simply want make stupid sexual innuendo jokes or people who enjoy social card games . i would describe it western , stategy mofia ... good stuff	1
this clever very fun card game . only reason i gave it four because when character dies player out game entirely . even though expansion there card brings player back life but , only one turn . plus its only expansion pack . but anyway , unless you out very early game which happen , its very fun	1

we twins our side side stroller getting old . i found these got 2 umbrella strolllers attatched them together . they very easy put take off strollers . we much more room van also , they take up much less space than original double stroller . only complaint i after they hooked together rubber pieces come out i put them back each time i attach them stroller again . ( but it isn't so bad . i really hope you enjoy this product , we !!	1
i'm not sure if some negative reviews roundhouse here actually kid-tested because this piece my son favorite geotrax piece , hands down . sometimes he'll just play this piece itself . it 100% compatible all existing geotrax pieces . here pros cons : pros -- great " geo-motion " automated turntable coordinated crossing signals which direct engine into garage or let it continue straight through . -- equivalent length 4 or 5 straight tracks , so this big piece suitable straightaways . -- great features kids who want pretend park trains ( la thomas) -- typical durable geotrax quality detail -- cost , i think this one best piecescons -- i honestly don't	1
we're fans geotrax series , expecially geomotion pieces . however , roundhouse designed very poorly , if all . there several design flawas which cause major frustration kids , i'll just explain 2 main ones : 1 ) roundhouse 3 tracks leading up it ; two it pass straight through one road which perpendicular . if train exits through perpendicular road , since roundhouse track facing direction , it cannot came back around enter through straight road ; same true if it exits via straight side . furthering this problem there no manual crank rotate roundhouse track correct port , so even if you wanted manually turn track accept train , you can't . train gets jammed up kids get frustrated . 2 ) many kits , including main set include additional cars aside lead engine . they attached behind lead . you cannot use train any length if you want it fit roundhouse - all cars must removed otherwise track gets jammed up when roundhouse tries rotate other cars attached behind non-rotating track . conecpt may good , but implementation horrible makes this worst toy my kids got last year . furthering problem , i can't take it back since it doesn't dissasemble	-1
i bought this because i love this episode simpsons . whats cool this you turn wheel back toy homer actually eats donuts , his mouth opens donuts fall his mouth . my son i laughed our tails off	1
although my granddaughter enjoyed playing dress up this product i don't think it worth nearly $50.00 i paid .	1
i purchased this " grand daddy " lincoln log set my 4 6 year old . i debated spending so much money , but it well worth it get " real " lincoln logs so many pieces them work . they make least 3 full structures set . storage case great storage , however little heavy side , but hasn't stopped my kids dragging them out play . because their ease , my kids feel so proud after they built ' homes ' complete chimneys !!! i recommend them anyone child who loves create things their own ( sometimes little help too )	1
game little confusing first , however it easy figure out second time around . gatekeeper little loud but game really good fun keeps everyone their toes - game timed . i own it all five my children love game	1

we similair toy melissa doug ( i think ) doors latches , but ... this one so much more fun educational too ! it shape sorter , doors open close , latches my son hasn't even really played yet ! he loves pieces putting them holes , taking them out doors , etc ... i'm very sad hear other problems it ... we bought it my son christmas - he 9 months old , but 2 older brothers , so ... we little pieces everywhere , so we watch him most all time he plays ... we leave it floor not problem latches , doors , pieces , or weight ! but again i'm him or watching him when he plays ! ( but don't feel this toy unsafe - others our house yes ... ) this one toy i wish we gotten my first son - best shape sorter my opinion we 5 ! my 2 older kids play baby all time ! it definitely baby ( maybe 4 6 year olds too ! ) latches aren't any more dangerous than one melissa doug so ... maybe why 18+ months age range !?	1
concerns negative reviews , both them gave toy labeled 18+ months one-year-olds . my daughter 21 months , this currently her favorite toy . she mastered her other shape sorters , this gives extra challenge latches locks . difference motor skills 12 months 18 months great . don't buy this toy one-year-old	1
i bought my 5 year old son pirates play set . he loves every part toy . there plenty play set works great both star wars pirates dolls too . it really allows your child use his imagination	1
wow , i can't say enough good things this item . you must buy this yourself or it would make great gift . music calming not too loud . lights design adorable . it durable - my son turn three it still his room . plus batteries last long time . i think i've only changed them twice . when my son baby this toy would sit his swing he would stare it hit it make it play . definite good choice	1
i bought two these my twin grandchildren . wish i bought more $9.99 price i paid hand gifts . great sound very colorful	1
this one neatest toys our kids . it extremely durable fun kids all ages . only thing negative this toy it difficult set up . but once it set up , there no maintenance . worth expense !	1
i bought this toy 5 years ago my children their friends still go it first backyard . it fun , fast safe great exercise too . ours through wringer 5 children friends other than replacing pulleys after 4 years tightening cable it withstood elements . i would definitely buy this again	1
i bought one these albums my first granddaughter , felt my second should one well . we lived state time first purchase , so i concerned she know her extended family . even though family lives nearby now , it fun pictures people you know book . both girls love look pictures . this particular album good quality cloth , pictures secure book , babies love chew play attached rings	1
what neat book this one ! it little more difficult kindergartener but definitely get them started this book . it teaches such myriad things - particularly hand eye coordination . one games them driving batmobile through streets gotham city trap bad guys ( joker , etc . ) but if you slip up all accidentally get off road , game over bad guy gets away . it definitely takes some skill attention so if you're needing , sure grab this book . this one those books gets ton play our house i'm growing concerned i'll buy second one soon after this one wears out ! highly recommend	1
master replicas known producing movie replica props expanded out disney franchise pirates o caribbean coin set . there several pirates coins produced elsewhere but not near quality price offered licensed pieces . detailing quality really top notch this set . you won't go wrong getting one these sets value cost quite high . i understand they problems sword compass quality control , my personal experience other products poor . given , this item still one their best deals well worth purchasing while you find them .	1
my 2 yr old son received starter track christmas 2005 absolutely loved everything it ... sound effects , working stations course train(so my 6 yr old daughter ) . he so pleased we took some his extra christmas money purchased working barrel lifter loader , additional engine bridge set . extra pieces we purchased he loves this most . he can't wait train make it around lift barrels watch them roll down other side finally unload them it all over again . his eyes light up when he sees barrel actually carried up side like magic . i afraid it may little too advanced him load barrels upon opening package but he manages it quite well no assistance me . my husband i can't believe how well it built how much kids enjoyed playing it . all train sets i looked purchasing this set offers most .	1

this new low , even our feminazi-drenched anti-culture . whole message this whore doll tell impressionable little girls superficial , arrogant , shallow slutty positive attributes , desirable healthy , contrast , true strength character , integrity , honor modesty ' losers . ' other words , looking behaving like skank tramp = " empowerment . " term so misued over last 30 years ( particularly last 10 ) , it ceases any truth it whatsoever . barbie used epitomize what it meant feminine , lady , fulfilled -- husband , home children . now standard completely perverted ruined onset dolls like this -- exchanging true values ( good wife mother ) false ones ( materialism promiscuity ) . even barbie face uglified -- grossly overdone mascara/eyeliner collagened-out lips -- resembling those hideous whored-out bratz dolls . realize -- this war our children souls ! mattel should ashamed themselves , hilt . this child abuse , pure simple . any mother who allows their child get one these monstrosities should jailed neglect her tubes tied	-1

this toy pretty easy assemble . it 35 pieces +7 ages . when i got this toy [ ] local ... store , it cool mini cd rom , but i doubt they make those anymore . coolest part set would either mask , or hooks . hooks used cling onto edgy cliffs , mask used breathe underwater . you go [ bionicle web site ] learn updates , bios , etc . great website toy . easy , fun , cheap ! =	1

if you looking inexpensive statue rock god . this one get . too sweet	1
we played this game family get together yesterday . it much too dry boring our family . we all intelligent people , but found this game laboring hard pronounce words obscure subjects . i guess if you enjoy slow moving trivia games , this would you	1
my kids played this almost every day since christmas . adults known pick it up play too ! only concerns i would mention : reload mechanism little hard my 4 year old use , i can't find anywhere buy extra darts . we lost one dart so far , i'm sure there more lost before summer . overall durable fun product	1
i purchased miele washing machine also miele stove christmas my 4 year old daughter . she absolutely loves them ! not one day goes she hasn't played them . i also bought small set steel pots pans fit stove . washing machine works water or without it not make mess if she uses it water . i am looking dishwasher fridge complete set	1

i'm agree most reviews . my niece saw commercial this really wanted it . my brother got it her birthday . it made spin master ltd . canadian toy manufacturer . it comes 3 beanie baby type bears , basically already made but no stuffing . fabric cheap delicate . one bear came 1 " rip it which my niece asked me sew up . operation success btw :) cute looking plastic mechanism you use stuff them cheaply made . zippers bears very bad tough . you stuff bear cotton only , therefore bear can't sit well like beanie baby . i recommend stuffing some beads his bottom . my mother said , " well price , you can't expect much toy like " maybe shes right , you decide . here jest toy : 1 . stuff bears w/cotton-like stuffing ( no beans/beads ) 2 . zip up bear your . 3 . most likely end up playing bears but tossing stuffer mechanism aside never use it again . toy would much better if it more inspired " build-a-bear workshop " allow us add choice eyes , nose , mouth ourselves . maybe some clothing too . i guess you get what you pay . but your better off purchasing craft kit make your own bears your child . much more interactive creative . or get some legos . legos plenty replay value you keep adding them forever . or spend day build-a-bear workshop . though it bit costly . :)	1
my two neices , ages 8 9 , received these christmas gifts they so excited get them they immediately opened them made three animals kits included could hardly wait use gift cards they received other family members go buy more kits ....	1
my mom got this my daughter this past christmas . upon opening little house bears came , i shocked just how much stuff came it . i didn't expect there 6 bears number one . number two , there actually enough stuffing fill all 6 them . it even came couple outfits bears . most shocking aparatus used put stuffing bears , actually works . you manually push stuffing down into arms legs , but i expected . turns out most important part this set up , key opens zipper back bear . you use key , or you not able open zipper . they anticipated zippers comming open , so they designed zipper not open unless opened this key . don't lose it , because zipper isn't comming down unless you key . we now ordering refills , we look forward doing it again . like little beany baby factory .	1
this one nicest doll sets i seen very long while . i really like they offering more than just caucasian version . they also this african american set ( awesome !!!! ) , hispanic set , asian set . now how cool ????? i give them all 5 big stars ! you get soooo many dolls each set each set so reasonably preiced ! i am ordering one each set ! this price how you go wrong ????? these sets wonderful . 5 big stars	1

this very good game . i started out shortz ' puzzles which why i bought this handheld . instructions stumped me day but since i paid $20.00 it , i decided call customer service numeber back book within 30 seconds i playing game . i no idea why they formatted gi gii figures all 8 . this what confusing . if you turn game it load screen all 8 . top , 8 form words g1 , then there space 8 form word gii . once you press set 8 form word gi , it take you first puzzle or you input puzzle number you want start . example if you want start puzzle number three then you enter 003 , if you wanted start puzzle 45 , then you enter 045 . if it puzzle 203 , then you enter 203 . once you've , then you press on/confirm button lower right hand side you're ready play . if you wasnt save or pause game then you'd press load/save button left . if anytime you want start game or redo one you're working , then you'd press undo/newgame button . it'll take you back gi/gii screen you just confirm game you want play . numbers 01 , 02 , 03 doesn't mean much far i tell . pressing any one take you same puzzle . i feel like i just wrote manual myself but i love this handheld i know game like this should not confusing , but once you know how operate it , it addictive books .	1
i think my mom likes these more than i !!	1
my son enjoyed auditory peek blocks when he under year , so i purchased this set when he bit older . i thought he would enjoy looking them since he absolutely loves any all types balls . well , instead looking them trying figure out how each ball moves inside , he just throws them . i could spent my $$ buying soft ball instead handing him hard block chunk across room	1

sometimes reviewers seem lack sense adventure . they surely know internet take them back history all over map ; thus , they easily discover lincoln logs honoring president abraham lincoln since 1916 /and/ continue win not only ' kid appeal ' but applause increasingly intergenerational group " toy connoisseurs " ! it happens i some ' grands ' could build right out their imaginations more convincing " prairie homestead " ~ but that what toys all , isn't it ? homestead comes bag horse some " real " cowboy types , reviewer mchaiku recommends you buy it /with/ stagecoach station in-a-can ! way , you all get down floor build this impressive two-story structure complete windows . . . or . . . you , reader , leave it kids use this great block time pursue your own back-log :~) reading : specifically , absorbing doris kearns goodwin book " team rivals : political genius abraham lincoln " ( isbn : 0684824906 ) ~ truly significant way celebrate president lincoln birthday .	1

... or you could get this now see tons footage return sith [ sic ] few weeks early . that really only reason i bought it , i not disappointed slightest . many questions form movie clip , there quite few questions episode 3 . none it 11/04 teaser trailer or regular trailer that out months . though if you really want see these clips , you're best off just playing dvds , rather than actually playing round after round tp them ..	1
my sons ( ages 2 3 ) received this tent christmas gift . they love using it their " hide-out " bad guys . however , rods used construct arches made wood . within first week , one rods broke splintered while boys playing . we tried fixing broken rod duct tape , but now rod won't bend very easily tent doesn't stay place it should . i wish arches made more flexible materials ( ' la pop-up tunnels tents ) so they could withstand normal play .	-1
this game my all time favorite ! my husband i play this game our children ages 16 , 12 8 . sometimes we play teams . it truly fun eductional .	1
i played this game years . it lot fun but my friends got tired it . i love fast passed action , which me less boring than scrabble , but not everyone thinks so . if you like scrabble you should enjoy this game . finding whom play different story . if you parent not hesitate purchase this game your child . i recommend scrabble dictionary close . if you you find out no time most your made-up words exist . since you not get penalties them try many you wish . game simple . you shake letter cubes when they all place you try make many words possible following continuous path through adjacent letters rack . ( diagonal counts adjacent ) path need not straight , but each letter path only used once . you three minutes ( sand clock included ) so . only words three letters or more permitted . you can't go wrong this game , plus it not expensive . it worth try . advanced players : if you look around you might find boggle master . edition 5x5 grid 9 more letter cubes . you still three minutes ( grid noisy ever ) but you make lot more points this one . happy hunting good luck .	1
if you just want expensive , cute little stuffed animal , all means buy away . if you looking nice place web your kids play , consider your kids may walk away very frustrated . there no way contact webkinz ( i find ) following issues : 1 ) your child use up half hour their alloted computer time just trying log webkinz . 2 ) there many error massages . most not make sense . webkinz technical support offers no support . it basically just blames any problem you your isp or your flash player not working ( even though it worked yesterday it work again tomorrow ) . 3 ) it sometimes logs your child out right middle game . my children simply stopped bothering webkinz lost interest their stuffed webkinz toys .	-1
this toy very cute but it stopped working after one week . handle also very hard turn get music play . this real waste money	-1
whole alphabet there 2 . this allows plenty letters teach your littles ones their letters , how spell their names and/or just teaching them words start learning how read . this toy better when playing it your child than him/her trying play their own . yet , what child remember their life - interaction their parents	1
my 4 year old little pony fanatic . we bought this her within 30 minutes crank broken . she not over turn it or mistreat this toy . i playing her when it broke . it impossible fix , my husband i tried twice it still won't work properly . cute this little playset , it not worth wasting money .	-1
don't waste your money this toy - it broke within first 5 minutes out box . it poor design hasbro not standing behind their product . twirling mechanism broke this toy 5 minutes out box . handle popped apart reveal small cog , screw metal spring . needless say , my daughter disappointed since " twirling handle " main function toy . i called hasbro they said " box it up " send it them so they could look it . so not only thing break but we deal hassle shipping it hasbro . customer service not very helpful . i asked them just replace broken toy - they would only if i would ship broken one them . we very dissatisfied this product fact hasbro not standing behind quality their products .	-1
we purchased this toy my 3 year old daughter . she absolutely loves it-it one her favorite birthday presents . all her little friends loved it too . it very sturdy product-my only complaint would cinderella arm come off few times , however it snaps easily back . songs very nice it volume control , which handy . i think this great product use introduce violin young girls	1
my daughter(then 5 ) really wanted violin christmas . we already firstact accordian which she loved . this , however , she not . i can't even make music using stick . heart front button you push down make music " beat prerecorded song " it impossible make song sound good even when using your hand . stick practically useless ( except weapon . ) kids usually just it play its own . everyone got sick three recorded songs very quickly . little princess front moves music ( first day ) she then fell off broke . kids played it few days , but it over year no one asked play it ... even when i take it out display it . big waste money	-1
i enjoyed reading other two reviews . it fun hear other little ones love this little stuffed pig much my 19 month old little girl . catherine picked it out when we vacation last summer it her constant companion ever since . like other two reviewers , i decided order second piggy . we almost lost piggy target other day when she asleep i'm not sure what we would . thank goodness 19 month old good eye her favorite stuffed animal kindness stranger seeing ground picking it up .	1

my daughter wanted movie soo bad christmas well doll . i saw black doll thought ... it good choice her my daughter same race . doll lot dances work promised . i'd recommend this doll any lil princess regardless which kind . sound little muffled so i don't suggest tv or anything too loud . nonetheless worth money	1

my son got these cars his first christmas when he 6months old . he now 18 months still plays these cars lot . fact , he his older brother ( 4 ) races cars . they soft , durable propel themselves . they also just right size - small enough hold but big enough not choking hazard . i given these cars gifts would so again future	1
we got one these our two-month old she just loves it ! you can't tell picture , but black lines toy stretchy ! it great gripping not too heavy ( our two month old hold it!)it worth every penny !	1
i put this rocket together w/ my 6 year old son fun project backyard . i very disappointed w/ construction . we put it together , i skeptical whether we would get more than couple launches out it . when we finally launched it , we couple premature misfires because i not put stopper tight enough giving us bit vinegar shower . we finally got stopper correct only see plastic bottle blast off leave fins behind . mylar tape failed stick after getting wet w/ vinegar . since this adult supervised activity anyway , we gone back estes rockets i flew kid w/ lot more success	-1
i used think ty made good toys ... but i wrong this one ! " fur " really weird material ( not plush ! ) awful " tacky " feel it makes it creepy touch makes toy look worn out old already . but even worse all blue spots actually painted ! you feel where paint dried it truly gross . i wouldn't recommend this toy , especially not give child . i yet decide if i should throw it into wash or throw it away altogether ! yuck	-1
our whole family loves this one . yes , volume loud but simply taping index card over speaker it muffled still understood perfectly , really . i found it loud first but we don't even use cover anymore now we two little boys house . product loaded information each planet giving kids choices find out history , distance sun , size , gravity/mass , year/day , temperature , space visits , moons , other fun facts each planet . they also make it easy child understand often making comparisons earth . anytime child may choose listen something else simply pressing easy use flat touch pad which plastic easy clean . when talking planet or moon picture lights up . if child chooses quiz his or herself gets answer wrong product correct them ask them again it seems within 10 or less questions . this product also happens lightweight , durable , easy clean if needed . it worth mentioning this product interface easier use than leappad . my boy already very interested solar system but this took it level fascination .	1

fun game family ( 10 up ? ) . mostly good mix randomness strategy . first it seemed too random my competitive nature , but once we really understood game , more strategies became apparent . i'd guess ages 10 up would enjoy , perhaps some younger kids too . i don't think i'd enjoy playing younger kids though because it long game ( least hour ) i play win . my son 13 handle ( beat me )	1

battery-powered thomas now replaced our 10-year old " sit-'n-spin " most-played toy our 3 daughters . we bought new thomas replace our old one , which endured trip through our daughter hair ( cut out never quite same ) swim toilet . old model went forward backwards ( cool ! ) but switch very difficult toddlers ' fingers manipulate ( not cool ) . new thomas goes forward only , but on/off button very easy use . we problems thomas . sometimes he just dies , then miraculously begins working later . also , since new thomas headlight ( cool ! ) , he battery junkie ( not cool ) . it common us go through battery every day . i now keep rechargeable batteries ready , i'm sick funding thomas ' indulgences . thomas jump track more often than he should , but doesn't seem upset our kids , therefore i don't care . problems prevent me awarding thomas 5 stars , but his popularity our kids earns him 4 stars . said , i'm going follow through one other reviewer suggestions buy brio engine next .	1
my son such great time first day then we change battery next day because it drained very quickly . i keep explaining my son , age 2 , it not good push it manually , because everyone else complained i worried clicking . we decided maybe take engine away until he bit older just let him track other non battery opperated car came it ( mine sir topham hatt set ) . but it too late unfortunately my son managed break it . he pushed down it make it go manually i think , bent wheel , or axel ? now it gets stuck back wheels stick don't move even slightest pressure . i works but not well . i think unless your child old enough just sit watch thing go round round keep wheels clean , it best buy non battery powered engines .	1

my daughter so excited when we brought out her special table chair plays it daily . it become spot doing puzzles , coloring , feeding her babies general play . it small enough she move chair table around herself , but sturdy enough she can't lot damage it either . all all , we very pleased this set	1
this table chair durable , classic , sturdy , " ergonomically correct . " best , there no assembly required ! chair came right out box , table only required me screw legs hand . it took two minutes . my daughter loves " cut out " her tummy well high back chair [ plus easy-to-carry feature ] . she enjoys drawing , tea parties her dolls , snacking this table ; so far it resisted all her climbing moving . i heartily recommend this product .	1

my son this toy when he only 6 months old ( christmas present ) he loves it ! he hasn't masted fact he should push down smokestack make it go , vs just spinning part train make noise , so right now it toy we both share . even my 3 4 year old niece nephew liked this toy	1
my 5 yr old daughter given this game gift . party they opened it played . all kids blast . you draw cards hop your bunnies hole hole . someone may draw spin carrot card . they spin carrot different hole opens up someone bunny may fall under hill . they can't wait spin see if someone falls . it says age 5 up but my three yr old plays her sister . if they count , they play . great fun !	1
my sister i ( both adults ) buy interesting card games play road or home when we want something , but just don't want spend hours playing other games . frog juice surprisingly fun . it little bit like rummy . it takes 20 minutes . older players i reccomend combining 2 decks keep things more interesting . otherwise spell ingredients get used up too quickly .	1
i agree all reviewers above . my 6 1/2-year-old 1st grade son adores this game . he needs use addition 12 developed planning skills . he picked up rules or more quickly than i . he now thinks his discards thinking strategically . game fun combination luck skill , great starting point young game fans . long your child basic addition , s/he should fine . importantly , it game parents enjoy playing too !	1
i orignal version this game when i little kid growing up . it great way while away hours long car trips or rainy day . i must say i'm really impressed mattel preserved authenticity game right down color casing , buttons sounds . those you who chasing your long-gone youth like i am , this great throw-back era . i highly recommend it	1
my grandson 7 years old . he loves game . whole family played it it enjoyed everyone . recommend it .	1
it nice educational puzzle more patient kids . reviewer said pieces weren't interlocking , so i warned , but i completely missed significance . bottom line pieces mostly cut shapes states , not lock together like traditional puzzle . it takes pretty delicate handling keep accidentally knocking states out alignment . positive side , pieces sturdy there none puzzle dust usually falls out	1
i don't know how they sell this so inexpensively , this puzzle very high quality would very beneficial kids all ages who need learn more us geography . i surprised how much my nephew enjoyed it , even though he just six years old	1
hands down game lasted generations . originally created 1960 , it so much fun it remained toy store shelves family rooms since . it seemed when i growing up my parents always included least one game when we children . hands down game left santa claus one year . my younger brother i looked box , we wondered if it dud or if it would really cool game play . we found it blast , especially if we could talk someone else into playing us . hands down cross card game board game . there slapping machine ( which lever facing each four players ) make sturdy plastic . when lever pushed down , plastic hand same color lever goes down card , which placed middle machine . luckily most parents this machine already put together so there no assembly nightmare ! deck cards other component this game . play begins each player choosing colored hand ( blue , green , yellow or red ) . then cards dealt - each player receives four cards remaining cards placed face down " draw " pile . each player takes turns drawing card pile - if you get match , you slap your colored hand down . last person slap gets one his cards taken first person slapped . slapping machine decides order because lever colored hand color coordinated " hands " lay top each other order they depressed . so colored hand top one who gets card taken away . here tricky part - if you draw card it doesn't match , you fake out your opponents pretend slap machine . if one other players slaps machine , then you succeeded faking them out get draw card them . boy my brother good faking everyone out - he master faker ! card taken one who faked out placed bottom draw pile . winner one most matches end game . end game when there no more cards draw pile . but let us not forget those special cards added keep game interesting . happy joker card wild card matched any other card form pair . sad joker card cost you points end game , so if you it , hope someone draws it out your hand ! simple game concept fun but get quite loud . when you're slapping machine , laughing , yelling carrying , neighbors hear you times . if you don't mind high noise level want play game children young six-years-old play ( but older " kids " like it too ! ) , then this game you ! if you quick reflexes you might even hands down champion !	1

everyone who plays this game says same thing : it masterpiece , it intriguing , it fun . there palatable depth game , too , opens up after few sittings . it quick simple setup - you turn off tv play round before bed . if you critical game , two things stand out . playing cards not laminated , which could taken lack quality construction . exploration theme game mostly irrelevant . players could just well building skyscrapers . neither my wife nor i found these ( 2 ) items issue . if you're looking unique challenging game play your husband or wife , then lost cities worth your money .	1

visualeyes , " what you see what you get " game . it dice game , sort . roll out large picture dice ( assembly required - possible " con " some homes , but big " pro " here - those my husband favorite words ! ) , try find 2-word phrases or compound words appear any pair dice . example , if you see 18 picture dice , one shoe horse , you might call out " horse shoe . " each die more than one interpretation . there die picture parent child next ruler one side , you could use it big , little , tall , short , measure , probably dozen other words picture . you could combine any those words any other pictures ... phrases anything common or known ( majority rules ) . possibilities endless . so far , we've only this game three days , it played kids adults , male female , pairs groups up 6 people . there no need " adjust " younger players . it always fun !	1

when my soon 6 yr old wanted this , i thought , oh now , $15 piece junk . i got it him after month him never forgetting he wanted it . 2 minutes out box , both he his 7 yr old brother ( both who completely different tastes toys ideas fun ) thier bellys floor playing thing . first 3 days straight , they nothing but play doodle doug his stamps . 2 weeks later they still love him but markers gone dry . i find more . how it works ! they've used appx 40 pages my printer paper . each one they fiddled button bottom made completely different designs it . i not see " messy " designs . i didn't find pens skipped or looked bad all . they look pretty close spirograph pictures old me . nice patterns different shapes . this my 1st review far i remember , that how impressed i this $15 toy . this first toy actually what commercial showed my boys both love it . ( also 13 yr old daughter who tinkers it ! )as " messy lines " people say it puts out ( guess i lucky , ours makes great lines patterns ) , while i wouldn't care what it looked like , isn't idea toys kids enjoy it ? not make masterpieces ? so , i give it 2 thumbs up price , keeping kids attention more then 5 minutes ( i've tossed many $50+ toy ended up junk ) ... oh joy ... actually doing what commercial says it	1
when i ordered this barbie , one navy blue dress shown , but instead one light blue dress showed up . she not look much better than off brand dollar store barbie , mattel should ashamed put out such low quality holiday angel barbie . general , their angel barbies stunning but this one stop short her thin wings ( looks like cardboard back ) , her hair mess , her dress so simple . her make-up simple well . also , she seems just stare off into space . i very disappointed this purchase . update ( 1/4/06 ) since writing this review playing barbie my daughter least once day , i found myself more often than not choosing this barbie mine when we play . i become fond her face even though first i not like it since it not what i expecting . it very nostalgic older style barbies , wider than it appears this listing . i also love way her arms pivot unlike some specific barbie dolls . her hair still messier than normal barbie , but i grown really like dress although wings hard stay despite velcro . i would recommend purchasing her simply because this unusual barbie mattel put out she add some diversity your collection .	1
i big pac-man fan growing up ( still am , i guess ) , so i very excited getting this play-at-home version . graphics , sounds overall game exactly i remember them , definitely not bad remake . but ... joystick , or how it connected software really aweful . 1 out 5 times you press joystick certain direction , game simply doesn't respond . ghost coming , so you turn other way ... but pac-man just continues run right into him . it really maddening , so much so after spending 10 minutes trying figure out what i doing wrong , i realized it just not made well . i think this cute " retro " gag gift , but not really made anyone who really wants play game or hopes get beyond level one , due poorly engineered controller	1
obviously this toy not recommended younger children(3 under ) but everyone else these things great ! i can't say enough geo mags ! i love them , my husband loves them all three kids love them too . they keep them busy hours inspire creativity . this set great too because you need large sets once kids get more creative their designs . my son 2 smaller kits they truly needed more . but these . you won't regret it . watch out magnets falling out plastic . if they discard them immediately . i've heard some scary stories regarding children swallowing powerful magnets . i like this brand ( geo mags ) better than magnetix because i think they better quality . hope this helpful	1

this awesome game requires basic settlers catan . game play last 3 4 hours . build cities , ward off barbarians , work other players but same time try win game . new cards rules make it great new game those who love settlers catan but getting tired it . great game not only high school college levels but older children adults well .	1
first time i played catan i taught cities knights . why throw someone pool before getting their feet wet regular catan ? because , my friend told me , once you play cities knights you understand why catan so addicting . it still . each week few friends come we watch movie play catan . none us really big " gamers " . none us own any miniatures , dice over six sides , or ever need create character . we just people grew up monopoly risk . said i now every version catan ever made we swap out things like volcano , great river , jungle other things last year we playing it , never gotten board game . it great its interaction others well worth frustration one might get when first learning it .	1
this expansion original settler catan adds whole new dimension game . after little time learning ( not much if you know original game ) you now playing game new depth . while it may harder than original younger kids , it so much more keep interest older kids adults ! each time you play you learn more game seems change " chance " elements game . our family highly recommends this !	1

i bought this bed my son who loves superheroes . i thought it would look great his newly redectorated room . it look great if you manage get it together . instructions came bed not clear or detailed . it uses hex screws assemble it , it include small wrench , but pain . me my huband working together assemble bed it took us 4 hrs it . we put togehter many beds , cribs , other things over years , this highly difficult . rails support mattress not manufactured properly . thankfully my father-in-law uses same type metal piping his factory . we replaced what came bed metal piping he made . piping bed came would not stay slots , piping cut half inch too short . so anytime bed moved , wiggled , or sat upon they would fall out . thus making mattress fall onto floor . my son so happy gotten bed , when we tell him he would wait day before he could use it he heart broken . all together once it assembled it look like photo . i would not purchased this item if i know it would require so much work us replace parts should worked first place . superman photos bed large stickers you stick headboard footboard when assembling product . bed also comes asortment screws bolts assemble bed . packaging they not clearly marked so you tell difference them . it difficult deciding which screws use , screw holes material not alienged properly . my husband re-bore most screw holes frame just so we could screw bold bed together . i not recommend purchasing this item unless you prepared work it . only good thing this item it ship quickly . i it less week order date .	1

my daughter loves all her weebles , she started her large collection this weebly wobbly tree house when she year old . she now two still plays it all time . first her favorite features slide secret hole tree house , when dropped down into , weebles pop through front door ! now she little older , she also enjoys whirly water wheel , spinning crow nest , removable swing . it no wonder why this award winning infant/ toddler toy year ! even my six year old enjoys it ! our only complaint tree house music very loud there no way control volume or turn toy off . also , it very sensitive slightest touch get it going . my husband i witnessed our cat walk past set it off ! it loud enough wake up our daughter ( very light sleeper ) , sleeping floor above , but since we aware how sensitive it , we keep this toy place where us walking won't activate loud music ! regardless how loud it , this wonderful toy must-have every playroom	1
great fun , interative but ... this toy would earn 5 stars if there either on/off switch volume , or some kind volume control . it way too loud ..	1
my 3 year old daughter recieved this christmas played it every day since . she loves slide features waterwheel especially , but seems play all accessories equally . it came lots extra weebles bikes ( it purchased sam club ) so she lots characters choose . music rather loud , but no more than town set . personally i think that one reasons she likes it so much . it great addition other weebles playsets i sure she'll gets lots enjoyment it	1
i like this toy although i feel it overpriced . it should stand $12.99 $14.99 most . i like it because it makes realistic sound . it no sharp or rough edges it nice size little boy . there aren't many western style weapons out there don't shoot caps make realistic firing noise . you always buy cap guns but caps give off smell loud bang not what i need right now . i prefer this rifle revolver combination their accurate yet not overpowering blast sound . set also bandana(small ) badge . both essential items recreate life old west	1
i absolutely love this game , yes it little different than original , but i like because same principal apply but it get little harder you get 30 seconds per round , you press button start , you get one word , if it gessed you press button once get point , if you think you enought time move next work you press button again , if word guessed before 30 seconds up you press button once get next point , other wise if it not guessed you loose entire points round . this makes it lot more interesting . only thing after while some same words start repeating , i would like see larger memory game . but it great	1
i no idea there whole kit ! i came here review crayola bath tub tints . all this other stuff ... who knew ? but i'll checking it out . i am life-long fan practitioner taking baths . my son follows my footsteps may well exceed my passion devotee good long , hot soak . we like look like cooked lobsters when we're . mere hot tubs tremble our presence . this crayola stuff so cool . i give it my full-fledged endorsement . there nothing quite like bathing nearly boiling purple water . ( or green , or orange , or blue , or red ... though i can't go yellow my son ... just looks too suspicious )	1
this excellent toy little ones - soft edges , no scary teeth or angry eyes . fisher price wonderful job this whole set : brontosaurus 7 baby , t-rex baby , triceratops baby -- however -- whoever priced this $29.99 must made mistake . fp own website sells it only $10 . it must buy toddlers	1

thomas train sets great modern versions classic indestructible wooden train sets . simple enough avoid toddler age frustrations getting cars run track yet complex enough engage wide range ages ( up including grandpas ) . all stories help imagination part .... books videos provide endless source adventures acted out , although most kids perfectly capable inventing their own episodes . here my advice , if you trying work your way through maze start-up options : first all , you spend fortune huge set .... even if you afford it , i would start something small give child joy receiving chain small but intriguing presents over long period time . it fosters joy giving/receiving helps teach them come back again again same toy ... watching it grow , asking specific items stories they hear , etc . several reviewers suggest painting old coffee table this great idea . i suggest figure 8 set ( most popular one ) or if you want spend little bit more , conductors figure 8 set . both complex enough interesting , but simple enough give lots room growth . almost immediately i would add new present one inexpensive engines ( you ask child which story they like best get engine them .... or buy engine go video or book same gift ) .... these would percy small engine , bill yellow engine , treavor , ( or bit more $ :) lady engine , james red engine , gordon express engine ( he one best stories , i think ) , or henry green engine . now good stuff ! give it month or so , then reward child something really cool like barrel loader or rusty construction 3 car set . i honestly can't see point huge multi hundred dollar system sets . if you want impress neighbors or something , go it , but i'm telling you ..... most kids enjoy large number small thoughtful gifts , not " keep-up-with-the-jones " effort your part . good behavior rewarded pick-your-own trip store ( there sometimes when real time shopping trip can't beat)by way , thomas stories based real restored engines run england mid-hants railway watercress line near winchester ( you read them even plan trip ride real thomas trains checking out watercressline.co.uk ) . they day trip london rail stations , although i recommend using bb winchester area staying overnight if you decide go . winchester center old saxon kingdom wessex king alfred well major early medieval site ( cathedral tombs many saxon kings well jayne austen izaac walton it where richard lionhearted crowned . )	1
when i saw this toy advertised tv then looked it up internet i very impressed rushed out buy it ... but i very disappointed . i admit i like all classic stories i remember when i kid it easy use but there way too little game . it four play options , first it just read story , which i am stay home mom so i don't need dvd read my daughter i myself . second option child read story themselves , which again if your child knows how read they it book don't need dvd . third option read play , this function i really interested . but it turns out there only 4 questions per dvd . i amazed !! how much your child really going learn just 4 questions . last option story games ... these vary per dvd depending what story there once again only 2 games . they could version classic game memory , putting story order , identifying letters , etc . those aren't too bad but i found some games , like memory game , you time pushing buttons just right time dvd loads your answers or you get it wrong even if you pushed right order buttons . i even problem getting timing right when i showing my daughter how it worked . overall i very very upset over how little there dvds ... 4 questions 2 games , my daughter got bored each disk within 20 minutes . if i could i would return game get my money back !	-1
my son 31/2 i got him this toy two week ago he play it everday he learning how read this toy so coolll !!!! my sister son birthday coming up i'm going get him one next week thank alot fisher pric	1
we bought this our 6 year old daughter christmas . it hit ! she really enjoys it . headset however doesn't get used . microphone feature headset works suprisingly well but it so heavy she finds it uncomfortable when trying dance . skill level wise - i think it perfect any child under 8 or 10 if they haven't years dance . our daughter taken some dance few years but she not very coordinated . this greatly increased her coordination ability learn dance steps . first it too difficult but she enjoyed watching it now she able follow much better . girls video also appropriately dressed seem like good role models . best benefit - 45 minutes workout while wacthing tv ! i'd recommend .	1
my 7 year old daughter can't get enough it . it teaches basic dance moves using mat numbers it then they put it music . matter hours , my daugther dancing away . she loves it . i highly recommend it	1
i purchased this clearance very good price say i am very pleased this item . it completely interactive lots fun my 3 year old son . we continue purchase many matchbox adventure sets this simply edition our growing collection . while i must admit his attention not stay this item long , he return it end . you enter wash turn lever move top elevator , here conveyor take car through rollers while it blows bubbles out well , then it down spiral track into wash tank spins , finally your out dryer spins also , hit release button off you go . pretty entertaining much evolved over anything i child	1
while doomsday figure looks pretty cool , it would nice bizarro , i really hate it they're dumping more batman , superman , wonder woman figures us . i already plenty those , thank you very much . notice box says doomsday figure exclusive this package , so if i want it i no choice but spend extra money figures i already . transparent amazo ? what kind sense make	1
my daughter received this game christmas although concept very cute game easy enough play , it very frustrating . gowns made rubber tear very easily . it also very difficult child dress undress princesses . other accessories also made rubber don't stay place , so you're constantly replacing them when they fall off . we now play game princesses already dressed play accessories only . this works out better princesses remain standing when fully dressed opposed using plastic stand , which tends fall off when princesses moved . nonetheless my daughter loves this game it one her favorites play , but personally i don't think it worth money .	1
i purchased this car christmas gift i very happy nephew because it . car works great i remember these types cars child . it works better than i remember any cars i played ever . great price too . great buy amazon	1
we two these sets go our larger geotrax collection , made elements up 4 units high . first i assumed they'd most fun elevated structures like clock or mountain , but actually these lot fun all themselves . other than ramps , green elevated track used either elevated or place regular track flat ground . these kits thoughtfully include some half-length straight pieces which give you many more options - example , now you use both arms 90-degree cross pieces come some other sets . i'm impressed design - even when we make 4-ramp roller-coastereque descent , train still stays track if you use guardrails curves .	1
new track really cool put together though little tougher then other track younger children . my 4 1/2 year old loves it but my 3 year old just can't put them together nor him understand concept . my husband i alot fun building large 3d tracks all over our living room . great toy but elevation series not 2 1/2 year olds maybe 3 1/2	1
this probably best magnetic construction set market . geomag much stronger magnets all other set . supermag also just strong but much more difficult play because varying lengths its pieces . geomags , you attach bars fashion which can't supermags . this set particularly nice because it also glows dark , you actually see metal bar magnets thru translucent plastic ! very cool . newer sets come booklet great magnetic science projects . this set not come booklet , but it viewed www.geomagsa.com website . this website also lots other great geomag products work well this set	1

this essentially one player version 2 platyer set . this pointless waste time . allow me explain , simplest terms , you cannot anything 1 lazer tag gun except listen sound effects . although , you say " what if i only need 1 gun " then i'd tell you price point this offered , you should just spent extra 20 get 2 . great game great system , but one pointless . read review 2 player system orthe irt-x2 review further product description .	1

this toy isn't what i wanted because it doesn't work tent it leaves small room playing . i don't really reccommend it	1
i love this product . i recommend advanced math kit , without packaging , since it seems best price per part any zome kit ( 1308 pieces i've seen it somewhere online $79 plus shipping if you buy it without case ) . you make really neat geometric objects ( find some these google ) , although my 3-year old too young zome he benefits too because i made him very nice bridge over which his toy train runs . it'll great when he bit older him play this pick up some math fun way	1

this trike just doesn't work . i wish i read reviews before i bought it . steering not work well . then if you try take adult handle off so your child peddle his own , doesn't work either . peddles don't catch . they just slip round round without turning wheels . big waste money . think twice before you purchase this .	-1

we hoped this would fun , stimulating toy our then 10 month old . christmas morning came , we tried it , touch-screen buttons didn't work . received new one buttons worked but only if you pressed very hard one particular spot . also , there not lot going , gets boring redundant very fast	1
i very disappointed this product . amount we paid xpv battery pack ( $100.00 ) it should last much longer . my son got it christmas played it couple times it pretty cool . but it so fragile , it already won't fly anymore . if i paid $30.00 it i wouldn't nearly upset it . i wouldn't suggest buying this product until either price comes down , or quality goes up	1
i bought cutter ebay scrapbooking . based upon crayola advertising how it " cuts where sissors can't reach " ( which bull ) - thought it would good cutting shapes alphabets -- felt $[ ... ] better than spending anywhere $[ ... ] $[ ... ] die cut machines dies . boy i wrong !! you hold button down continuously keep it powered --- which makes your hand ache after minute ( this thing give anyone carpal tunnel syndrome !! ) ( i am sure they designed safety feature kids perhaps , but i can't see how if it hard healthy adult use -- how little child hand endure this ! ) additionally , no matter what angle you hold it - it very hard get teeny blade perforate or cut anything properly . even when moved super-snail pace , no cuts clean . they look if you tore them out paper . i tried over over , using directions then trying many different angles , speeds , varying pressure , no avail . this thing piece junk !! total waste my money time . it sits my drawer gathering dust . i am tempted send it directly crayola headquarters i would like see them make 3-d picture intricately cut flower bird using this piece junk . yeah right . don't waste your money	-1
don't waste your money ! i not buy this amazon it unavailable , but don't bother find it elsewhere . you push so hard cutter get it cut it tears paper . my 11 year old unable use it effectively . i barely able get it cut clean line . can't imagine frustration people paid $30 plus ebay get one these christmas . i'm returning mine use credit some good safety scissors , constuction paper glue	-1
just got this our 11 year-old since she loves artistic this wonderful buy . it easy use comes 3 different stencils . ( 1 shapes , other 2 letters ) but , you purchase regular stencils ( plastic kind ) any local store use those . you also draw freehand what you want cut out hold it just your would pencil trace over it cut it out . you make so many neat projects this such 3-d cards ! or just cut out shapes then glue different color paper underneath . if you little artist your family , get it . it great adults well , especially if you like scrapbooking . it good bargain	1
service i got amazon amazing whatever i ordered came within days no waiting . products just nice if i bought them store shipping handling great also .. thanks letting me home shopper ...... barbara penna	1
please don't waste your time money this piece junk . it falls apart constantly not stand still while playing . plus platform top not hold many batman figures . i purchased 4 action figures none them fit top , so platform completely useless . my son who 4 gets frustrated because accessories come apart city falls back . it not sturdy . very disppointing toy ! not worth time money !!	-1
toy itself car great . my 5 year old runs it around all time ramming it things it very durable . however , when you try turn it into gotham city it becomes bit challenge everyone . first there no lever we could find lets middle pop down , so you literally fight it get latch let go . this fight adulta well children . second there these chains you latch floors city hooks attach chains too so small you really work it get them go . my 5 year old gets very frustrated when he tries turn it into city most time just plays car part . it bit disappointing him because thie toy he really wanted christmas it turned out not what he thought .	1
very cute dolls . kind small but rather durable . they sit or stand . arms legs bend . my daughter playing them nearly all time	1

i purchased this set figure 8 expansion set my son christmas 2005 . he just over 2 years old , he loves thomas tank engine particular , all things train related general , so this very easy decision make . quality learning curve wooden track very good ; pieces made hardwood , quite sturdy . while we expanded using other generic tracks which compatible brio/thomas track , there noticeable difference quality . i would offer one caveat . this set very similar conductor figure 8 set , which typically offered same price . while water tower comes this set pretty neat accessory , i think conductor set offers bit better value , it comes thomas two cars ( water tower set only comes one engine one car ) , well additional switch track conversion ramp . these offer bit more flexibility layout play , especially since my son not terribly interested water tower right now ( though this may change when he gets older )	1
we gave this our 4 yr old son his birthday . when he opened it - he yelled out " cool ! " . i don't think there could any higher praise 4 yr old . he wanted water tower , but since it retailed $25 alone - i felt it definitely worth it spend $15 more get whole set ! thomas products learning curve excellent quality provide years enjoyment your little engineer	1

when we puchased this here amazon , i read reviews raved how easy it put together within 2 hours . we consider ourselves intelligent people , but we found it quite different story . directions pictures , written explanation might more helpful . pictures not show correct direction pieces some cases , so when we got few steps ahead , we realized we piece backwards take it apart backtrack few times . finally we started checking few steps ahead make sure it work later if we this now ..... so , it took my husband i 4 or 5 hours i guess complete , we finished it flashlight just after sunset christmas eve ! but , we like outcome	1
i purchased this item my son his 1st birthday . my husband friend put it together 2 hours didn't seem any difficulty it . we purchased two infant swings replaced big kid ones came this item most our friends infants or toddlers so it seemed make sense 2 infant swings available . my son not much climber 12 months old but love swings . he appeared afraid slide down slides well . he now 16 months old expert climber lol . he loves climb his gym set slides down his slides over over over again . he plays this set often climb slide independently now course mommy close . this item very sturdy appears perfect fit him his age . we looked into more expensive wooden sets but they all seemed bit too big him such young age . i see him getting plenty use out this item until he 6 years old which time we plan upgrading larger wooden set . it seemed make sense buy this beginner set because anything larger would difficult him get much use out until he bit older . most larger items i recommend you purchase it your local toys us or target because shipping this item very expensive . buy this item store , save money shipping use it buy your infant attachment swings instead : 0 )	1

my 2 year old daughter got this present within month it broken . while it worked , she loved it very good it . it often frustrating though when she would push handle down over over get no bubbles . eventually , thing stopped working altogether . i figured batteries died when i went change them , i found bubble solution leaked into battery compartment . i initially chalked it up my daughter maybe i didn't see her something it so we bought her one . this one broken within few days due same problems . concept this great , but not worth money all	1
my daughter received this gift her 1st birthday . she likes it so much i came on-line purchase one friend decided look other reviews . i'm surprised negative comments ! after watching me demonstrate how use bubble blower my daughter able use it ease . once it primed ( few pulls handle trick ) bubble blower produces 10-20 bubbles each time handle pulled . course she doesn't always pull handle down far enough nor she always release it enough dip stick bubble solution but that all part learning . product leak bubbles if it tipped upside down but package tells you . maybe i'm just not critical enough but less than $15 my kid play something she loves - bubbles . there absolutely no way she could work bottle wand bubbles . instead bubble blower - give your 1 year old bottle bubbles you'll much bigger mess she probably won't able blow single bubble .	1

yes , controller mini wpt final table-how cute ... i've playing over year now(i paid $30 canadian still think it worth every penny-even though blue button now starting make clicking noises , it still works fine ) still play it once month even though i 5 ps2 poker games i enjoy more . characters this game don't speak but least it spares you hearing repeated phrases occur all other poker games currently market(though you could always just turn voices off , if you wanted ) . also , if you make final table(of 6)in tournament you'll get hear mono version wpt theme before round starts , which nice touch . a.i. later rounds blinds increase gets very aggressive . i would say it most agressive cpu a.i. i've come across so far(excluding pc games ) . ps2 wpt videogame checks way too much but still more fun play overall(tons variety)and it cards big , colorful easy read . ps2 videogames , world championship poker 2 , stacked world series poker come close times aggressive betting style(constant raising)that this wpt plug play game incorporates but still not consistantly wild . this plug play wpt poker game , even though i've unlocked ability access any 9 different tournaments 9 different satellites well cash games(the tournaments 50 over 300 people each)instantly because i got enough points become wpt player year over 14 million dollars ; it mostly cheating(the game auto save after you win or lose , but if you lose , you just shut off unit before it auto saves you won't lose your buy-in amount . you start beginning tournament again but this way you reckless your all-in still enough money enter again)because cpu players maniacs killer tough . cpu bluff all-in garbage one hand then all-in pocket aces very next hand . you just never know what cpu . even so , it play logically most time even slowplay top pair . cpu only make occasional questionable play but that allright since they all play different skill levels i assume(you only adjust cpu players individual skill levels multi-player mode ) . it , however , bit too easy times make small bet flop early position all 5 cpu players fold ; even big stacks(though , even ps2 game stacked , i sometimes get huge stack fold against my tiny all-in bet ) . this wpt plug play game you also go all-in frequently get them fold , but if they hand-look out ! so going all-in or limping garbage , very risky later rounds especially when you're playing against some top 10 players whose names faces always stay same so you recognize them(as opposed other characters who look same but different names ) . after all-in showdown cards turned over slow enough rate some suspense but i'd prefer able press button turn over cards after i figured out what percentages my outs(as no % shown like tv or ps2 version ) . you set cpu betting speed slow fast also just press blue button make them bet right away . rules-wise , one thing this game differently than ps2 wpt game turn river minimum bet supposed double big blind , but not this game . however , most casino tournaments don't double these bets no-limit games anyway . one minor thing i like , if pot currently let say $500 you then bet $200(making pot now $700)causing other cpu players fold , it show you won $500(because $200 your last bet never called , thus not officially part pot)whereas all other poker games say you just won $700 pot , which misleading my opinion . also , game only flash freeze if your four alkaline aa batteries get weak after 20 hours use . if you use regular aa batteries game freeze less than hour . that why reviewer probably trouble freezing . game save your career stats(such % flops seen while small blind , etc . ) also let you see your current game stats any time just pressing red pause button front side table . graphics passable color . well , cards big enough easy read . though none players bets shown beside their names(they only appear briefly betting window bottom ) , so if you cpu betting set brief delay(like i do)you'll only know how much you need call not example which players raised or re-raised or how much(if there more than 1 cpu player still hand ) . one more annoying things this game you only 30 seconds make your bet(it countdown circle meter-you hear clock ticking during last 15 seconds warn you)or else you forced either fold or check(if checking possibility ) . other dumb thing you can't save middle tournament ! yes , it makes it tougher cheat but it still annoying sit through 2 hours straight playing close match only realize it time work . that why i prefer my ps2 poker games(only world championship poker 2 hard rock casino don't let you save middle tournament . ) so , all means , if you're poker fan want test your skill luck against some wildest players ever(thus 4 star rating ) , buy this game after months practise you too should able win some this game tournaments without cheating(or least come close )	1
this very fun game definitely gives you " just one more game " thrill you're looking . you adjust speed so once you get hang it you don't wait nearly long game bells whistles . my problem during tournaments . game keeps running total how many players left . but it seems people dropping out like they giving away mansions down road . you start 100 players it down 85 just ten hands . becomes issue because money those players lose go somewhere , when new players fill empty seats your table they often ludircrous amounts money hand . few exits your table you go chip leader shortstack without calling hand	1

i bought this toy my daughter christmas , loved other parents brand toys we've bought her . my daughter initial reaction fear . it extremely loud , needlessly so . i suppose level noise supposed imitate real car , but it really just annoying if you're parent , little scary if you're one-year old . once she became acclamated level noise it made , it hold her interest . very least she found remote good chew toy , pleasantly surprised button it fact move car . assuming she close enough car . someone said range 15 feet . maybe they modified our model car even crappier . once car got 4-5 feet away , it hesitant respond acted bit squirrely even when it respond . 15 feet ( less , really ) remote became totally useless . i figured time my daughter would get hang all these nuiances it would probably provide few minutes entertainment here there . time not our side . toy broke less than two weeks after christmas . remote no longer works all - batteries fine . car turn , noisily sit there its flashing lights , but that it . needless say , small token fun value this toy gone . don't waste your money this toy - it guaranteed disappointment	-1

this shape sorted purchased my oldest child first birthday . he also special needs pt ot time . 4 years later after 3 kids , this toy still much loved looks like new . we also had/used many shape sorters this one far best . it appealing younger older children , younger ones may need more help getting 6 differnt shapes right holes , older ones like flip it back forth getting all shape then opening it starting over . far quality , this sorter made hard plastic . so even during those early teething years , this toy show no teeth marks . hard plastic allows it easily go dishwasher cleaning	1
my three year old loves this toy . she now control over her own music player , there no cd scratch . i highly recommend speakers -- we never use headphones	1
if you more than one child , or your child plays other kids , this must-have addition your fisher price fp3 player . my son finds it easy use , this way there no bickering over who gets hear headphones . they don't get too loud , but they loud enough provide music kid bedroom	1
we bought this truck our 2 year old he fascinated " trash trucks " , he loves it ! even months later he still loves playing it . my only possible complaint would it somewhat hard carry places back truck different opening points which makes truck flop open while trying pick up or carry , especially little one . this not big enough problem , however , me not recommend it . it sturdy there other pieces little tikes line vehicles coordinate well it	1

this such great idea kids ! tooth brush plays music when you start brushing your teeth . harder your kids brush their teeth , louder music gets ! kids love it because they like show guests how their tooth brush sing . you room while your kids brushing you know they're doing good job if you hear music . if not , you tell ' em " i can't hear you brushing ! " awesome , just awesome	1
my seven year old son thought this fish tank coolest thing he ever seen . it really , awesome coral formations various undersea creatures , course floating sharks . it lights up , which makes it even cooler . but , when we put water it , it leaked all over counter . so , heavy heart , i packed it up sent it back . i didn't dare order replacement tank , thinking it might same thing . instead , we went pet store , spent many more dollars 10 gallon tank , light , filter , heater , coral reef decorations , scuba diver , plastic plants , gravel . . . . oh , course , fish , still work progress	1
i got this my son last year when he 4 he really likes it . good boys who want adventurous but parents who little cautious ! it very sturdy durable he likes fact he use it scooter or skateboard . only con i see tires little bit wide back when he puts his foot down push it , his ankle gets hit wheel . he careful makes sure his foot placed wide enough out . other than , great toy	1
i bought this product my daughter xmas two years ago . it hasn't got much use because it difficult steer narrow sidewalk . even so , wheels become very loose their plastic trucks , i can't find way adjust them ! if you're looking scooter , skip this buy type scooter . if you're looking something train young child ride skateboard , this may you . i'd recommend this off-road model opposed one regluar skateboard wheels - off-road wheels take more abuse they handle riding grass bumps . because its limited speed steering , i wouldn't recommend this child older than 4 . older kids struggle keep up their friends riding regular scooters if they're riding switchboard	1
we gave this our 2 year old we putting up our christmas decorations . she loves decoration her own play , since she can't touch many other decorations . it enough pieces keep her interest , but not so many they all over house . also it cute enough leave out decoration	1

well we purchased this toy - slinky dog , because our son loves toy story this looked like best slinky we could find . we recieved it quickly my son blast it . even hugs it even though its not soft .. ha ha ! legs not move which i not expect them too , but those wondering this toy it wheels its feet string out its head thats 4-6inches long . there string upper torso backend through tail inside slinky parts so toy not over extend . ( helps keep slinky part not stretched out ) - those never slinky toy if they stretch too fast become misshaped hard reshape if all . also like add my son get it little slinky bent next body but its toy kids things like it really didnt ruin look or funtion toy all . its easy clean . ;) short : toy great rolls wheels	1
dog not slinky dog toy story but fact , authentic " slinky dog "	1

i given original jetfire present around 1985 , i remember very confused when watching transformers television show because jetfire called " skyfire " although coloring same , overall design definitely different . he same guy ? if not , where skyfire toy , why didn't jetfire appear tv show ? i not discover until 15 years later this something licensing . original jetfire toy not based transformers toy line all , but some bizarre cross-marketing scheme somehow ended veritech fighter macross/robotech getting autobot symbol slapped onto it . evidently hasbro/takara able procure rights produce toy , but not include its image tv show . cool thing this " classic " transformer its design no longer resembles original jetfire/veritech design , but skyfire design appeared transformers tv show . they would better off calling this skyfire , but probably banking popularity original toy help sell more units than memories tv show ... or there some other bizarre licensing thing behind scenes . definitely good piece tf history own any collector	1
easy plug into tv easy play . draw paint . there even pictures you color . shake cartridge start over . my almost three year old no trouble using cartridge .	1
i love building bricks . i love batman . i hate this set . this most disappointing " kit " i've ever misfortune purchase . i complained directly manufacturer their ill-fitting bricks , but naturally never heard back . most bricks fit together loosely causing them pop off most inopportune times . flat base pieces made poor plastic too thin , so unless you very flat very hard surface ( sometimes even then ) , bricks pop off . floor " upper level " completely warped because bricks so poorly shaped fit together so badly . thank goodness lego got batman license built decent kit . it too bad this set , building plan nice design nice . but it wasn't worth frustration nor price . not even mini-figs worth it . what up freaking lavender bricks anyway ? i don't recall batcave colour . ugh ugh ugh	-1
i got this last summer my two young boys they absolutely loved it ! there small but steady stream water comes each side every 3 seconds or so center erupts . likes - kids play this forever ! it easy screw off hose . dislikes - there not steady stream water going up ( since it bladder fill explode ) . you cannot adjust water pressure too low or it won't erupt , so it not good small lawn area . it not convenient shape store . because side streams , lawn doesn't get watered evenly kids play it . it very good value . there bladder fills water erupt inside eventually popped after year half use .	1

this game developing steady hands children well teaching them balance . dozens plastic penguins equally divided players . players then take turns placing penguins onto tiered board balances center like loose lampshade . if any penguins fall off during player turn , they become part player flock . knocking all penguins off not automatically lose game . first person get rid all their penguins wins . because fallen penguins re-enter play instead knocking out player , this game run ten or fifteen minutes . there some setup necessary penguins arrive three pieces need assembled . this pretty easy but some penguins seem go together better than others . because penguins distributed evenly players extras left out , loss penguin or two not keep game working . my kids lot fun playing this one , especially my daughter who currently very into penguins . check it out	1

we bought several these bionicle toas our 5 year old son who just loves movies . unfortunately , several these bionicle kits advertised amazon ages 4+ but when we received them kits say ages 7+ packaging . these toa kits definately not 4 year olds ... too many small pieces too difficult average 4 year old put together . i've ended up putting them together our son myself re-put them together whenever they come apart while played . other than age issue , if you buying them played action figures i think you might disappointed . they go together fairly easily but cannot played roughly since they come apart , just like other lego products . buy them you would other lego kits , not action figures	1

this toy works very well ! i very surprised magnetic pull darts strong it . granted , one magnets fell out dart after only 2 days , but not big deal .. bit glue job . i like this one much better than velcro ones ... every bit fuzz , pet hair ... whatever gets stuck those after seconds it out box . overall , i consider this good purchase . my son loves he play darts while we play our board	1
we got one these gift , it total failure . " vehicle sound block " toy supposed make sounds vehicles when blocks lined up correctly . we got batteries , but toy simply didn't work . no sound , no nothin . ' we also given one their farm sound puzzle toys couldn't get back panel batteries open . tried using small philips screwdriver , safety pin , etc ., it simply would not open . lack sound disappointing , though our child still liked pretty puzzle . this company seems well plain wood toys , but when they branch out into electronics , products fairly shoddy . i plan avoid their products future	-1
material printed , it not real costume . my 3 yrs son loves it , but i think you get something better amount money .	-1
leap pad systems wonderful learning tools . price family meal fast food resturant you provide your child interactive tool learning . not only book help your child read but they play games too	1
i bought this toy my 2 year old . yes , he loves it but i think it would better 3 or 4 or even 5 year old . it gets quite messy but it easy clean up . there large piece plastic comes box handy put beneath sand box it makes cleanup lot easier . there also many little pieces not good small children . i 10 month old who puts everything his mouth i watch he doesn't grab these little pieces . but overall , whole point toy my child loves it spends long amounts time playing it . he very enthusiastic construction equipment he loves play dirt so this toy he best both worlds !	1
we just bought this doll my daughter third birthday . she loves it ! less than $$ you can't pass this doll up . belle beautiful long hair your little girl comb(great fine motor skills practice ) . all her clothes removable easy washing well additional skills practice your child . she comes tea set cookies two . my daughter loves play tea her . belle only sings short song when her hand pressed . it very sweet , short doesn't easily go itself like other toys . if your little girl loves disney princesses this great affordable addition her collection . overall , this toy wonderful buy .	1
these toys great both gender children age 3 up	1
this one those really neat things every kid should try least once . city mini world great back drop watch these amazing little creatures grow . we still it fact now new generation living among our growing metropolis . we might purchase little more advanced set because when " monkeys " get big they sometimes get stuck when you trying oxygenate water . this no big deal because i can't imagine very many kids wanting keep them this long . my husband i love " sea monkeys " want see them thrive !	1
i bought this my grand daughter who turning 3 . she loves it . especially because she close it up carry it her where ever she goes	1
i got this armoire dora dress up adventure doll two outfits my daughter second birthday . she absolutely adores dora this her first doll she change clothes . she really loves changing clothes doll putting clothes inside armoire . armoire comes gown several hangers hanging up dora clothes . inside doors , there hook one door mirror other . hook nice hanging up dora accessories . there also handle top carrying . doors easy her open , yet they latch so if she carries armoire handle , doors won't open spill out clothes . there also room bottom armoire storing addtional accessories like shoes . only drawback armoire most it hold four outfits available dora dress up adventure doll because there lots accessories these outfits . thing clothes don't stay hangers very well . i found some stay better than others . overall , this good storage place outfits dora dress up adventure doll	1
i bought this my daughter 3rd birthday . i assembled it 20 minutes . box came mangled though it several scratches all white instead pink like picture . also some pieces didn't fit together all way , though it still seems sturdy enough . my daughter played it every day since her birthday . i love all melissa doug products	1
this toy keep my children engaged more than 30 minutes . thomas his friends wooden collection far best all thomas toys . it durable very effective . take toys nice , too , but magnets not allow you connect more than 2-3 cars time . magnet just too weak . track accessories take kind cheap . battery operated plastic ones nice , but track comes them simply horrible , especially automobile track . wooden ones gives you durabilty , playability connectivity . track very durable , connects very well ( even thought thomas brand very expensive ) , connectivity magnets far superior than take line ( my son connected 10+ trains without single one coming off . collectibility these things really gone up popularity , well . discontinued items sold auction $40-$50 times , one single train . only gripe i cost . one wooden train usually $10 . you get them free dvd much ( maybe couple dollars more ($12-$15 ) . larger trains , such gordan , henry , et al , even more . thomas track very expensive , generally hard spend much money . you get imaginarium brand ( which makes thomas stuff ) , considerably , but not thomas name . there other knockoff brands ( ikea one ) , but those not usually compatible thomas stuff . my children like thomas due personalities all engines , how they brought life dvds . wooden thomas just adds hands fun kids , if you don't mind spending little extra , you get great product .	1
my son target all his milestones until i bought this toy whole collection . he became obsessed it he would not want play anything else asked me buy more more thomas toys . i made tests him he showed developmental delays . two child psychologists two occupational therapists told me it statistically common children become too obsessed this particular toy they show developmental delays . therefore , i got rid all thomas collection my child now again track his age . but it took me some time correct his behavior therapies . i would not recommend this toy any child . if your child gets too obsessed it , discard it yourself favor , not buy collection	-1
i'm 11 years old i'm still huge fan thomas . i know every characters name number . only part i don't like little toy people company uses . characters telivision series so far : thomas , edward , henry , gorden , james , percy , toby , duck , donald , douglas , oliver , harvey , emily , murdoch , aurther , fergus , mighty , mac , molly , neville , lady , bill , ben , skarlory , rhenahas , peter sam , sir handel , duke , duncan , smudger , bertrum , rusty , salty , boco , daisy , mavis , diesel 10 , bowler , diesel , dennis , spattler , dodge , iron arry , iron derek , bert , spencer , stepney , jack , alfie , byron , kelly , ned , oliver(2 ) , isabella , max , eliethabeth , bertie , bulgy , terence , trever , cranky , bulstroude , lorry 1 , lorry 2 , lorry 3 , butch , thumper , boulder , canal boat , t.j. tyson lorries , frieght trucks , cargo cars , coaches , old slow coach , annie , clarribel , fire trucks , . . ruffy , toad , n.w. breakvan , city turou engine , flying kipper , sir topham hatt , lady hatt , harold , tigermoth , buster , nelson , monty , patrick , proteus , rosie , freddie , rocky , jeremy , sodor airplanes some minor people . we all know there more characters some day . i know who ever reading this like come how many characters there . who every believe me books rev . . awrdy wrote 10 times characters . i also every episode thomas that available time . well other words i think you should buy all thomas products . this site best prices . remeber me s.l.j.c.o.a.a.a.t.r	1
i purchased this set my 3 year old niece birthday . i knew eventually her younger brother could use it well once he little older . i works very well both sex children relatively easy put together . you may need more than one person hold pieces while you screw things together but once place it very sturdy set . my niece thrown just everything three year old this set it still looks brand new . we'll see after her brother it year or so , if it still looks good . now though , i'm very satisfied quality	1
this pretty cool set . so if you want just get it collectibility then go it . if you want get it kids play ? well depends ages , but it pretty cool collectible	1
springs this toy extremely tight , making it very difficult babies toddlers operate . althouhg it nice see dinosaurs instead all other familiar characters , all other pop-up boxes i've seen quot ; rewardquot ; child popping up much less hand strength required	1
my daughter given this toy when she one , she played it over year . firstly fun seeing dinosaurs pop up , then she grew little older she'd memorize which color dino under which color egg , see if she could get it right . i think this one best presents she got her first bd . definitely recommend it	1
my 4.5 year old son got this santa . he loves it . if it superheroes he love it ! quality toy pretty good compared other toys out there . only major complaint we cityscape keeps falling out starting get frayed put it back into slots all time . it would nice if either matchbox made cityscape fixed or out material or both . overall i still would buy this toy again	1
my son loves thomas i thought this would perfect game , but it not . trains not turn easy , he not it i ( mom ) difficult time getting trains go way they suppose go . i disappointed this game	-1
my 4-year-old son loves thomas enjoys this game alot . i agree turning corners tricky bit frustrating but my son not mind all but he tends longer attention span than even myself .	1
i bought 3 these various family members friends . all girls ( ages 5 , 11 , 12 ) loved doll ! i happy see ! parents already made children put dolls away , not taken out boxes ! it nice know dolls taken great care ! besides , kwanzaa barbie doll beautiful deserves placed pedestal , so speak	1
i gave this game my sister her husband christmas they loved it . it fairly easy learn games not require long time commitment , unlike many strategy games . i enjoyed this game so much , i bought 3 more - one my grandparents , one my mentor student one myself . it reminds me uno different " house " rules added make strategy more complex . i'm still looking efficient way " shuffle " tiles . it inexpensive game 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 players i play several times night .	1
there two ways play this game . you play it basic rules . this game last 15-20 minutes minimal strategy . second way play this game advanced rules . this game last 30-40 minutes much more strategy . best part this game it alows quick rule explanation understanding . worst part this game even advanced rules , there still huge amount luck involved . whatever case . this great game if you looking quick light strategy game	1
i start off honest . we don't lego james * yet * . he still waiting join lego percy tracks , but i wanted tell you how much fun lego percy , i am sure lego james just great . first , thomas lego trains cute . they very good size small hands , although they don't come very much track , it doesn't seem matter all . my son ( 3.5 yo ) spends all his time playing his lego percy floor , combining his new friend some huge coach constructions he made . ( really some them huge -- lol)he this virtue fact duplo size lego wheeled vehicles pulled lego james lego percy . so not only he get play his favorite steamies , but he also gets make things ( sheds , even cranky ! ) his duplo legos . [ mega-bloks work too)five stars . cute educational toys allow lots imaginative play . my one suggestion would buy other legos - particularly some wheels bases coaches- if you don't already own some . this way lego james his educational best . your child build all sorts friends equipment . note : our lego collection 3099 . i couldn't find it amazon but i think lego duplo 140-pc . bulk tub ( 5352 ) ($15 ) wheeled base vehicles connect thomas friends lego trains	1
i wrote this review anakin starfighter , but this same toy other than paint scheme , so . . . this great toy . it very sturdy weighty . there no cheapness or junk construction . i would gues it last long time , even when played our 5-year-old boy . even smaller , more vulnerable parts such cockpit canopy landing gear seem tough fit together well . plastic type not break ( least not easily ) . i accidentally stepped it dark night ( i weight 230 pounds - pure muscle , course ) it not even crack or warp . he loves playing it too . we run around house mock dogfights . ( hint : if you make your starfighter hover behind door wait your enemy wander past , you fire your missiles quickly behind before enemy chance tell mom it not fair . ) overall , best toy we purchased long time - all sorts reasons . i even let my son play it now then . :	1
this toy best-looking jedi starfighters . i think it better-looking than even bright green toys us exclusive anakin/darth vader ship . unfortunately , you wait until august buy obi wan pilot . until then , you might better off using obi wan figures aotc phantom menace " pilot " ship , because rots obi wan figures not fit into cockpit very well . especially " jedi kick " obi wan figure . anyone else disappointed few more cheesy figures released this film ? i really disappointed figures lightsabers molded into their hands actions don't work ( jedi kick obi wan comes mind ) . please , just give me basic obi wan figure , maybe cloth jedi cloak ! someone who owned several vehicles original trilogy when i kid , i vouch durability new vehicles . old toys , nothing worked . tie fighters solar panels wouldn't stay , millenium falcon , cannon satellite dish wouldn't stay . course figures not fit well original vehicles . hasbro seems worked out most these problems ( except maybe figures fitting ) . obi wan starfighter great buy twenty bucks , it looks great out box display . one other thing : instructions say you fit " most " r2 droid figures place r4 drone comes ship . i tried rots artoo figure , it would not fit all . maybe r4 g9 " preview " droid fits , but i don't own figure yet	1
i agree other reviews this product . it carry more keeps everything together one " package " . my son carrying case he likes backpack better	1

this best lego set ever made . lot stuff godd price	1
near-perfect translation nhl ' 95 , not-so great port madden ' 95 . i'd originally heard fifa ' 95 ( soccer ) supposed here too , but i guess it never made it final product ... i got this last night - hockey some ommisions original ( like players names - here you only get jersey numbers ; i assume there problem licensing , possibly related current nhl lockout ?! ) , but otherwise still same great game , ton fun play . football , however , barely playable . you barely read plays , there hardly any sound ( no crowd noise , poor ' maddenisms ' ) , even music title screen isn't classic music - it just re-used hockey music . design / implementation-wise , i thought they could've made it so you could daisy-chain controllers together , but no - single player version this completely separate product - if you want play two player you buy two-controller version - you can't add later date . this unfortunate because these games ( original genesis versions ) supported 4 players , which course ups fun factor lot , but isn't possible they way jakks decided put it together . i continue love this product hockey game , but i won't even look football game again . if you're old-school fan nhl'95 , then this worth cash , but i just wish they could left out football enhanced hockey ( like putting players names - it hard remember who who back ' 95 ! ) .	1
i bought this over xmas break . we original rummikub my ( just turned ) 7 year old hard time playing it . she wants included rest us , but can't quite keep up . so i got this game see if it would easier her if we would all enjoy it . it so great ! she totally " gets " this version ! everyone fun now . thank goodness this game	1

my 10 year old daughter received this gift ; all games she got birthday/christmas , this top five . game requires some strategy -- random draw card , you must choose which horse compete event . each horse varying degrees strength four different categories , but only used once game . players progress through each event , they must use weaker horses -- this where strategy comes , players must think advance best way use their stable horses . " right " answer not necessarily use strongest horse each time . additional complexity , there also equipment cards boost strength horse single turn . adults won't find this game particularly hard , but interesting enough make it fun play your kids	1

you clearly see your hairline under cap , not mention little triangular tip very obvious top cap , making you look like human condom ( pardon expression ) . also , most caps come small " makeup " kit help blend cap your skin ( highly recommended ) . this one course not . i fortunately only needed this cap one little gig , it served its purpose . but if you planning making bald cap part elaborate costume , i'd advise you look elsewhere .	1

we bought this our son fourth birthday . toy listed 8+ year-olds , but our son knack remote control vehicles , seen fly wheels television , really wanted one ( he no trouble operating toy ) . toy takes four aa batteries one 9-volt battery . regarding controls , although they look simple -- simply back forth -- each wheel independently controlled since truck designed flip over when it runs into something it can't power over , flipping causes " reverse " become " forward " vice versa . not deal breaker , but still bit confusing , probably take most kids bit time get used especially since toy designed run circles if you only engage one wheel time , since toy flips over very easily , even if you just stop it quickly ( not just if you run it into something ) . novice , it hard get toy run smoothly back forth . maybe design advantage some , but we found it bit frustrating . deal breaker us toy not work you might expect , nor like line remote controlled fly wheels advertised television . television commercial , fly wheels shown easily going over rocks sticks " rough " backyard terrain . not so reality . we took power claw outside our flat lawn covered leaves , toy immediately got stuck leaves ( stuck wheels seized-up refused move , and/or stuck just spinning its wheels going nowhere -- either way you go over pick it up move it area ) . it got stuck pine needles . it got stuck long grass . it got stuck short grass . it got stuck dirt . it run well our flat , cement patio . regardless if " claws " or out , we could not get this toy run well any " terrain " except carpet , cement , ceramic tile ( note , if " claws " out , they would pull get stuck carpet pile ) . additionally , we laid out pillows , blankets , sleeping bags see if we could run toy over indoor " kid stuff " terrain , , again , no luck -- it either pushed stuff aside or flipped over went reverse , or simply got stuck , spinning its wheels -- we never actually got toy " power " over anything , rather it would flip run reverse . after our son tried tried find somewhere ( besides patio ) play this toy outside no avail , he walked up me said , " we need take this toy back store--it junk . " this retailed target $29.99 , but clearance $19.99 . now we know why .	-1

my husband i bought this our son christmas who 8 months old time . we never bought vtech toy before , but christmas we bought 3 . 3 , 2 broken within 2 months after christmas . first one broke 2 weeks after christmas . i po'd because this not cheap toy . my son nothing break toy . he never broken toy he dozens fisher price toys some leapfrog . page center changes modes stopped worked all sudden out blue . we tried exchanging it toys ' us 4 times , they never got any back stock . i tried e-mailing vtech customer service my e-mail returned saying e-mail doesn't exist ?! aside all , issue babies ' hands fingers getting wedged under pig ridiculous . it shouldn't passed safety checks . i wish i realized this when i bought it , though i admit my son never tried stick his fingers there . he only tapped pig front make it swing . voice isn't bad . it didn't bother me all , but because i expect house full noise toddler around . final note , my son enjoy this toy very much month or two . now , 4 months later , he doesn't even bother look it or kicks it away if i give it him . save your money !!	1
i don't know what took me so long write this review , but we received this gift our son last year when he 7 months old , he loved it right away . we not . you've probably already read this here dozen times other reviews , but first foremost , it kinda dangerous . swinging pig just enough room little fingers get wedged , i only figured out when i saw my son stick his fingers there , notice they sort wedged , yank them back out his own . lovely . other problem ? guy singing so terribly off key it hurts my ears listen . what kind idiot green-lights toy their company off-key singer ? if you're trying foster musical aptitude your little one , this isn't toy you . issue , toy flips number color mode simply hitting theh " piano " key twice . so , you get one , red , blue , five ; rather than one , two , three or red orange yellow . not such big deal , ok . but then there issue orange pig . see , piano keys say yellow like sun or blue like pond . i guess they couldn't come up withh anything orange , so they made pig orange . only thing ... pigs pink . my son tired this toy now , thank goodness , cuz i'm tired supervising him so his fingers stay squish-free . please , folks , i'm telling you , you don't want this one	-1
i think this toy great , my son recieved it his first birthday . first he wasn't all thrilled but time when his interest skill pushing things wheels grew so they this toy . little door back really inrested him , he loves just opening closing , putting blocks inside hual around , nice gripped handle great too . really child friendly shapes textures , colors etc . he easliy carry it push train around enjoys pushing it construction dump truck one he well . he almost two now , still plays these . even though now he well put his older brothers thomas tank engine inside	1

entire line geotrax road ' ' rail toys great kids ages 2 1/2 up . they promote imaginative play creative design , they're attractive solidly-constructed , etc . however , while some add-ons better conceived than others , rocky falls tunnel among best . set consists hard plastic arched junction two flexible fabric lengths tunnel . these tunnel pieces detachable so they used separately or part this set . however , when they're not attached main base , it looks unfinished , i.e. you definitely tell pieces removed . also , when using fabric tunnel pieces any capacity , they're very picky curves - train oftentimes get stuck tunnel if it not used straight section track . so , it best use t-intersection middle straight tracks coming out all sides . set unfortunately includes no track pieces . set operation controlled train passing through , but not traditional geomotion way . when train passes through , it trips light sensor under archway which triggers water wheel well some cool sound effects . sounds include both train nature effects ; set randomly selects which sounds play each pass-through . set also occasionally throws out random nature sound even when train isn't coming through , which adds fun atmosphere overall landscape . sounds well-recorded volume just right . when completely assembled , set large side ( just shy roundhouse or mile high mountain base comparison ) , so plan your geotrax layout growing when you add falls . overall , this add-on lot fun versatility it offers makes it great addition anyone geotrax collection . pros * motion-sensor trigger sounds actions works very well * sound effects fun pleasant * detachable fabric tunnel pieces also fit into each other use elsewherecons * flexible fabric tunnels picky when used curved tracks * when fabric tunnels removed , main piece looks unfinished - why not include hard plastic caps look like rocks	1

this fantastic jump o lene . mine lasted over year ( cat house ) . come folks , why would you buy one these indoor jumpers then take it outside then complain it ? would anyone put together bedframe outside then try bring it inside ? this not tonka car ; it big , borderline obnoxious but totally fun jump o lene . kids love it . i this exact model couple years ago kept it inflated hand pump ( not recommended ) . whats really nice each octagon self contained so leak won't deflate entire jumper . two concerns you ponder : 1 . it big cumbersome inflate/ deflate it hard find place store it . 2 . chemical components pretty nasty prior magically transformed into plastic state . but if you indulge this one buy	1

we picked one these up our daughter when she started trying sit up her own . she wanted so badly sit up without our help , but didn't strength or balance it , so we figured this seat would help her , while giving her sense independence it . it worked beautifully ! it took only week or two using this seat ( 15-20 minutes day ) before she started able sit up without it ! some things we noted , though : 1 ) when we first started using it , we watch her carefully . she very small , used turn sideways it , putting one leg up over side , while other stayed put . she never got hurt or anything , but it frustrating her . this problem short-lived , however , only lasted first few days , until she developed better sense balance . 2 ) we wait while after feeding our daughter put her this . she would lean forward try reach her toys , pressing her belly into part seat comes up front . sometimes she would lean forward so far it would push her belly make her spit up if she just recently eaten . ( our daughter difficulty spitting up anyway , so other kids might not problem , but still i think it worth noting ... ) seat very easy clean though , so it no biggie perspective ... just bit annoyance us our daughter . 3 ) once she mastered art sitting up , she started trying kick her feet forward while pushing down , see if she could move seat backward . it not slide , though ... it tipped . she almost fell backwards few times doing this , we very glad we there catch her . she padded surface safe environment , so wouldn't gotten hurt anyway , but it probably would given her good scare if she actually fallen all way back . still , even these experiences , i recommend this seat ! i not know if other seats this type market would better any these regards , but i thought this seat just fine its purpose , especially since we only needed it such short while . big thing remember it -- this true all things this nature -- it needs used parental supervision	1
my 4 year old plays hard his toys . after 2 months intense daily play clay , dirt , sand , water , concrete scrambler great condition . i'm truly surprised it holds up so well . magnet holds trailer which flips over reveal bob tools only accessory take alongs my son thinks worth hauling room room , in/out bathtub , outside . its worth while toy	1

bubble machine absolute hit children party . it worked well produced lots bubbles flew through yard . there only one downfall . when wind didn't take bubbles into flight , they would pop concrete . this made concrete extremely slippery dangerous childern playing around machine . it just needed little more powerful blow bubbles further . after we moved machine , all fine	1
my sister i couldn't wait get this bubble machine because my twins girls her daughter love bubbles . when you get burnt out blowing million bubbles ... let this machine it you , lol ! kids so much fun chasing bubbles all over yard . only downside machine it uses almost entire big bottle bubbles dollar store it blows out so many bubbles spits soap so fast , you adding more soap like 15 minutes after you start machine . good thing bubbles came dollar store so we could buy bulk . we love this bubble machine know you too	1

first i thought these where greatest invention since legos mega blocks but after playing them i slightly disappointed . i really would given it 5 stars if they weren't hallow inside . also you really need buy least 2 or 3 sets since you really can't build much anything 22 blocks . then there problem storage . pros : -soft yet durable ( feels like smooth foam)-great colors-light weight easy hold-comes clear plastic container . it tight squeeze get them all back . i would look something else store them if they going used daily basis . most children no patience put them back exactly same way every time . cons : -they hollow inside so they don't `snap ' together like mega blocks or legos . -each piece must sit directly top same size block or bigger block otherwise it tip over	1

this joystick system much better than first 5-in-1 ms. pac-man joystick system two reasons : 1 ) control much better 2 ) it saves your high scores . ms. pac-man almost identical arcade version , more challenging than many " late-model " ms. pac-man super-fast ms. pac-man slower ghosts . previous 5-in-1 model this joystick serious control problems , it times almost impossible play ms. pac-man because controller . namco improved joystick responsiveness so it what you tell it . although i still noticed some problem it turning down unexpectedly , it vast improvement . galaga fantasic easier play new base . also , namco added memory game so it save your high scores posterity , which one drawbacks 5-in-1 system . other games : pole position plays just like original arcade game but not fun other , newer racing games ; xevious fun five minutes but that it ; bosconian mappy aren't worth playing ( anyone even remember these arcade ? ) . if this joystick dig-dug ( pac-man controller ) it would perfec t.t his great game anyone who grew up fan these games , it also great younger kids who appreciate simplicity ease-of-control " classics . " my 5 year-old nephew loves this well .	1

alphabet nesting stacking blocks great ! not only it teach children sizes space recognition it helps them learn their abc . educational fun these blocks provided lots fun my 2 year old . only downside they made paper not wood - which perfectly clear description . so , if you child chews things you should watch him/her carefully so they don't eat blocks while playing ! ;)	1

my son loves these toys ! i purchased them target clearance one dollar 90 some odd cents . what deal ! i went several target stores area found different pieces no more than three dollars . my son 2 � great dexterity start but these taught him even more skills using screw drivers , wrenches other little tools included set . my concern he could possibly fall metal tools hurt himself but now he careful them . i am also not overly pleased play sets but trucks themselves lots fun . play sets seem little cheap but die cast trucks worth money , so me makes up lack imagination designers part . he sit play them hours end , mixing matching different parts different trucks . this purchase well worth money , i just wish i would noticed them before now . this would make great gift toddlers .	1

hi . i recieved this doll my 6th christmas . she adorable . now i'm 12 . doll still cute ever , but mine stopped working when i 9 . me my mom tried everything , new batteries , shaking her little , but nothing worked . i very dissapointed . i haven't able play her years . i still don't know why she stopped working , it just wierd . me . but what cheered me up while i zapf creation.com today , i saw where new talking chou chou coming out soon . doll amazing . she says " i love you mommy , your best mom ever !

i bought rock-a-bye chou chou my 4 year old daughter christmas . she hardly left it alone entire week ! she really loves it treats it just like real baby . we dug out all my daughters old baby clothes our amazement all her 0-3 month outfits fit chou chou perfectly ! we saving money because now we don't need buy special outfits chou chou . me neatest thing it she wearing my daughters baby clothes which brings back so many memories . i think this doll very nice looking - but pictures posted customer amazon deceiving . chou chou doesn't any hair her eyes blue , not brown . i hope amazon comes realize this error something it , people expecting doll hair . some people say young children may get frustated doll , but my experience my 4 year old i not agree . she developed her mothering skills over last week i come admire her patience when doll cries . she talks so tenderly lovingly pats her back get her calmed down . it so sweet watch her interaction chou chou . i purchased many dolls my daughter past - but no doll ever developed so many responses my daughter . i am very glad i got it her !! she glad , too !!	1

i bought moon sand set my 4 year old nephew christmas . well , within minutes him opening it , i found myself setting it up him play . carrying case/play surface blowup which little difficult inflate , luckily air compressor available . there no way he could inflate this his own . but once it up , fun began . play area wasn't big it appeared pictures commercials i seen . but it didn't seem bother my nephew . moonsand it easy work . all you need squish it together until it easy work stays together similiar putty or clay . i ended up much fun he . molds come it good too . though sometimes sand hard get out them without it falling apart . it takes couple tries until you get feel it . sand little messy , if it not squished enough it literally like sand flies everywhere . i ended up covering table plastic keep it getting all over things . clean up easy though , what get carpet or own clothes easily swept up . when we playing we simply put all sand molds case , velcroed it shut it ready take anywhere . overall , it big hit my nephew . successful gift sure !!	1
both my girls loved this toy . i needed something keep them busy when i went out town i bought this toy they spent hours playing together this set . what i like most it all stuff comes it fits inside it it easy them clean up their own	1
i bought this christmas so we could try different sort game . reviewer mentioned , directions sort vague . gamepiece big plastic thing looks like flying saucer . one side there hole your hand ( draped plastic material , so you can't see ) , other side there window . top , there 30 second timer . when timer , light comes inside flying saucer so anyone looking through window see what going . game comes cards pieces . game cards sets pictures them . example , sea creature card would picture seahorse squid it . you spread these cards around flying saucer , face down , then put corresponding pieces ( i.e. seahorse squid ) inside flying saucer . play game , you spin ring around bottom flying saucer . ring pointer it , whichever card it stops , you flip over . set timer , then stick your hand into flying saucer feel around objects shown card . it not clear me whether you supposed get all items listed card 30 seconds or just one them . we've change few rules . we only use half cards items . my five-year-old doesn't like timer . it doesn't ring or anything , it just makes him nervous so we don't use it his turn . we allow one o-o ver per turn . my kids ( ages 5 7 ) play this together ( without parents present ) without fighting . they focus more fun feeling around objects or helping each other saying " hot " or " cold " than they winning or losing . sometimes they even play themselves . i feel like it money well spent , because touch both game toy . materials appear good quality too .	1
my 5 year old received this game christmas . although we found directions little vauge , we enjoyed playing it our own way . you definitely challenge your sense touch , which so often overlooked . you set rules make game harder or easier depending who playing . game durable but it would very easy lose little pieces which would ruin game pieces so unique . directions make no mention ordering individual pieces may get lost . i would recommend this game families who enjoy playing lots different games together	1
my 9 6 year olds love these ! they version 2 3 . this yellow one my sons it blue it too . version 2 version 3 connect each other even though 3 newest version ( coming out march ) . we got ebay since they weren't available anywhere any version stores . games version 3 different characters too . there more than one snacks treats , version 2 only one . you get souveniers passwords version 3 , not version 2 . it like taking care pet , including fact they die you get new pet pressing reset . you get boy or girl , but you can't pick , each time you reset . big it means you need new battery , which $3 . this new hot craze , elementary school kids playing them during recess bus lines . educational part it responsibility end learning how feed , nurse sick ones , let them sleep etc . otherwise , no educational value i see . they get addicted like video game they check them regularly	1
we love game . board came apart after 3 or 4 uses . game pieces stickers plastic . i know everything made china but it poorly made	-1
i bought this game lonely evenings my gf . we both 26 we play lots card games more . rules very , very poorly explained after playing game twice , we not even sure we got everything right . rules definitely lack examples visual details . definitely not recommend game , mine end up yard sale this coming spring . could good family-oriented customers , but not provide any excitement " young adults " alai	1
my 4 7 year olds love this book ! it lot like book it got lots silly sounds speaking it makes it definite winner dr. seuss silliness	1
my daughter great time playing online her new friend . she loves stuffed animals , but additional interactive piece makes it worth money . she learning " earning " money " paying " things . she reading lot website worries taking care her little charge . games diverse enough even her 12-year-old brother enjoys some ones challenging her . its nice little stuffed dog too	1
we love this hat . it excellent quality very easy adjust . it lovely soft lining looks very authentic . when my 3 year old firefighter took it out wrapping , he said : " now i fight fires because i this fireman hat ! " this style hat better than rigid plastic versions , my opinion .	1
our daughter chose this toy herself store when she saw chicken . it great fun easy take you car or restaurant . forewarned though ... she lost sheep requested they replaced	1
i love video now ! i am still saving onw but my brother one they so cool	1
each my three kids received one these players christmas love them . i think they pretty cool myself but major gripe operation this toy . we exchange one three right after christmas because players video screen would not work some time even though sound still playing disc . new one seems operate ok ( so far !! ) but now one other two players my kids received now acting just like first one we exchange this one . i'm going put complaint hasbro see if they can't ship these units better failure rate . my kids absolutely love them but if they don't operate properly , well ........? you dedcide	-1
i prefer lilani , but kiani cute too . they both long brown hair lilani brown eyes but kiani however bright blue ones . lilani comes pink black striped t-shirt " zipper " top netting sleeves . she blue jeans cuffed reveal silky light blue material . belt light blue glittery . her shoes black mary janes red decorations . kiani comes light blue ribbed tank top black ribbon sleeves decoration . her skirt blue plaid pattern black , pink , green . her belt pink . her shoes blue gym shoes orange decoration . i definietley reccomend these dolls . you'll lot fun them	1
if you're fan bratz babyz , interested checking out new kidz line , this great place start ! each sister comes her own purse , well matching outfit their original outfits . earrings removable , interchangable , so i wouldn't reccomend it 4 year old , but 6-7 should ok this item . while kiani could considered lost bratz babyz hair flair friend , her outfit exactly like her original , exception shoes . lilani pleasant surprise , after running bit water through her hair rid stiff crimping gel (?) she absolutely perfect , right now her mary janes . while kiani looks exactly like her promo pic , lilani far prettier than shown image , her hair loose , rather than tied back . accessories , aside purses , include two barrettes : small , silver butterfly barrette well pink , star shaped sparkly one could easily used your child hair . kiani sports usual babyz bottle , well her own monkey . this must buy any bratz fan , if only lilani , andretails most stores around $25(but i found mine 21.29 ) lilani , far , prettiest kidz girl out so far , your little one won't able put her down ! while you may hate or love original bratz , kidz actually look like their target market , each beautiful must ! all all , they great investment hours fun . happy hunting !	1

reward milestone accomplishment , my daughter requested toy camera . make good my promise , i began searching good camera buy . believe it or not , this far more difficult task than it sounds ! most i found actual real 35mm film cameras . others digital quite expensive fragile 3 year old . we found little tykes one local tru shape monkey face . it pictures animals view finder changed every time you pushed button made noises comments based what kind animal shown . it even winked each time you pressed button . it seemed kind cool , but when i showed it my daughter , she'd nothing it . " it not camera , it monkey , mommy ! " she also didn't like fact it made sounds . bottom line , she wanted toy looked more or less like real thing didn't pretending her , this one fit bill . it requires no batteries , it actually looks like camera , not some cutsie rendition camera . fact it actually spits out polaroid-like pictures bonus my daughter , since she plenty fun playing just camera . any toy , there some plusses minuses , i'll attempt list them here : plusses : 1 ) most " realistic " toy camera i've found2 ) not need batteries3 ) no annoying noises ! hooray ! 4 ) pictures laminated inserts plastic frame . these pictures turned over drawn crayons ( subsequently wiped off ) , or simply replaced family photos . 5 ) extremely durable . this toy dropped several times even fallen husky friend , doesn't look worse wear . 6 ) strap so camera worn around neck ( my daughter liked this feature ) . minuses : 1 ) button eject pictures little hard push little fingers first . my daughter her friend eventually got it , but only after hour or so fiddling playing it . putting three or four pictures time instead maximum five seems make button little easier push . ( probably main reason i didn't give this toy five stars)2 ) there slight learning curve load pictures into camera . my daughter her friend eventually got it , but they still needed little help time time . 3 ) strap goes around child neck safety break it . this good safety feature , but problem it it breaks if child starts jumping around . this isn't big problem , since all you need snap bead back together . so there it . this good toy child active imagination wants things just like mommy or daddy , but not so good one who expects lot bells whistles . hope this helps	1
this great sippy cup . one nice feature i hadn't aware when i bought it it skid-proof bottom . my only " complaint " there no ounce marker lines cup	1
my three-year-old obsessed mary poppins , so we got this surprise birthday gift she loved it ! my only objection , harried parent point view , would umbrella , which not perminantly attached doll easily misplaced if not vigilant . also pretty little red string tying cloth umbrella simply unties easily lost , allowing cloth fall umbrella stick . what mary poppins without her umbrella ? otherwise , lovely doll	1

there seems some confusion around which stock x-23 which variant . unless toy biz now stocking varaints 3 every one standard figure , black one variant . several stores i've seen 3 or 4 purple outfit , only 1 , if any , black . some this confusion proably stems card back . figure pictured there much closer black version , but closer inspection reveals it not actually either . body sculpt identical both figures , it heads paint ops different . pictured most likely earlier prototype . ( there even discalimer effect card back right next upc code . ) bishop variant doesn't scarf pictured card back , iron fist flipped ( dragon going wrong way , well hands wrong sides ) . graphic designer either made mistake or working earlier versions figures , either way , purple much more common . i previously stated , both x-23 use identical body sculp t.t he purple version head scuplt wilder hair , expression give her much more feral look . i believe eyes supposed brown , like wolverine . included comic book nightcrawler observes their eyes identical . black version straighter hair , much colder dangerous look her . green eyes , overall look taken her appearance x-men : evolution . she great figure , well female figue . toy biz tendency past overacentuate certain female attributes make figure look like girl . not so her . she looks like scrawny teenage girl ( claws her hands feet ) . both figures good , it up you which version you prefer . both come head apocalypse , 5 6 figures variant , you build two apocalypses only one duplicate figure	1
i bought what i thought interactive book it described . i received small cartridge looking thing but no book . i live europe so last ten years only recently adopted 4 year old boy , i no idea what i buying would require piece machinary or equipment . i it shipped my brother house states then only received it couple months later when my mom came visit , it too late return it . so it completely unusable waste my money . i feel information provided internet should clearly indicate order read this virtual " book " one requires piece equipment	-1

last year i told myself i would never , ever buy my children thomas train set . they expensive ! , our town library one must cost hundreds hundreds dollars -- more incentive all us go there . since my kids enjoyed set our library so much , i softened my position thomas looked into modest , figure-8 set additional locomotive . when this 60th anniversary set sale 25% off during holidays , it only $15 more than figure-8 set(about $40 ) additional locomotive small car ( $20 ) ... which not bad since it included thomas , two box cars , henry his coal car , station , covered , elevated bridge , stop go station , more interesting track layout . my kids absolutely love this thing ! , i love playing it much they ( or without them) ! they favor this toy over everything else they received this holiday . best part my son daughter enjoy it equally . my kids still very young i am excited they get more pieces their set over years instead large , cheap , miscellaneous toys they forget clutter our house . so far , it only toy i forsee saving my grandchildren . i love everything this toy .	1

my daughter earlier version one shown so it possible they addressed some these issues : 1 ) most games 1 minute time out which really frustrating my kids2 ) " oh that not so good " - if i hear barbie say one more time i may just throw this thing out nearest window . my daughter get score game she feels really good barbie says , " oh that not so good , but you'll better bit more practice " this broken my daughter down into tears more than once . 3 ) there no parental controls . i wanted turn off or lengthen timer . i expected those sorts features oregon scientific . right now most fun thing my kids it play flower fun game ( like hangman ) type " icup " if you looking newer version this i would strongly recommend playing demo few minutes check it out	-1
it seems like nice complete set playfood , except boxes really flimsy cardboard , i've thrown most them out already . it doesn't take much crush them . there much nicer sets out there , there separate pieces sold ebay , probably used but stand test your kids much better . not worth money	-1
this looks like such great toy , packaging really impressive , but don't fooled like we . i assumed paying close 25 dollars it would somewhat durable-just reasonable durability-i don't expect much plastic toys ... but this really really bad . you might also think paying much would give you things like closable doors ... you know , 99 cent matchbox cars ' doors stay closed , but space shuttle doors don't-which limit it " fun " factor . " movable arm " just free floating plastic stick simply stuck into hole .. it doesn't even stay . " launch pad " fuel tank/boosters down right horrible . they don't connect shuttle , which disapointed all us , especially my son . it so cheaply made , i really can't believe it wasn't bought dollar store . my son so excited this set . but after playing it just few minutes he hasn't gotten it out again . i would definately not recommend this	-1
i bought this my daughter her 11th birthday . after playing game once , she asked me if i could take it back . she said game boring because it so limited far what you could game . my daughter always played lot " simulated life " video games ( i.e. , sims , animal crossing ) online games ( i.e , club penguin ) . i suspect this why she found this game limiting . other games she played portray more intricate " life " therefore draw player greater degree . my advice would consider what your daughter used before buying this . if your daughter no experience these types games , this game probably fine . however if your daughter previously played simulated life games , she probably find this one lacking .	-1

when i first got it i sooo excited ! but when i opened it , it no instructions . even 10 things it didnt explain how work everything . sure it fun first but then i realized , " how am i supposed anyhting ?

this puzzle ( also known rubik revenge ) good fun - because it layer movement , it much more likely fall apart than 3x3x3 cube . however , puzzle reassembly also quite fun - requires no force ! clue reassembly - make sure last two pieces same colour edge pieces - they ( very gently ) snap into place . second clue : only centre pieces ( four flats pieces each side ) fit into grooves ball - gentle , your cube good new . start four centre pieces one colour bottom - build up cube layer layer . remember ! no force	-1

while my son enjoyed illustrations anf fun content books this set , i felt it disappointing learning tool beginning readers because it moves much too quickly . first book just letters letter sounds . very introductory . second book introduces three letter words right off no transition all like 2 letter blends . ok me since it phonetic 3 letter words , but page 2 we already " leaping " 4 5 letter words page 3 they already introducing sight word - " " double consonant word - " cannot " . i thought pace frustrating my son . i hoping/expecting book devoted just blends and/or 3 letter words . instead this program organized vowels letter introduced first . i don't see problem , but i expecting more phonetic 3 letter words start introducing harder 4 5 letter words maybe book 3 sight words coming later , like maybe book 4 . unfortunately , you can't see exactly what your getting until you open box . nonetheless , audio entertaining children music humor thrown reward stickers , poster , ribbon fun way recognize your child achievement . practice game basically just like word whammer fridge phonics product but cards instead magnets	-1
i high hopes this game , but played it friend last night appalled number confusing questions just plain incorrect answers . example , one question asks , " which these animals not found exclusively south america : ( ) chinchilla , ( ) sloth , ( ) guinea pig , ( ) spring buck " . ruling out zoos , my friend reasoned since zillions kids us pet guinea pigs , answer must . alas , no ; correct answer " ( ) spring buck " no explanation . they mean animals their natural habitat ? we aren't sure . question not clearly written . question asks , " word `berserk ' derived : ( ) norse god ; ( ) german `crazy life ' , ( ) tropical plant " . i read this my friend said , " none these right answer . " word `berserk ' comes germanic branch language tree means `bear-shirt ' . game says correct answer " norse god . norse mythology , god `berserker ' always fought state frenzy . " there no such norse god . who wrote these questions ? one aspects trivia games i enjoy prospect learning something process playing ; this game concerns me because i not know which answers incorrect . learning standpoint , badly written questions poorly researched answers make this frustrating intellectually dangerous game .	-1

i just finished world largest crossword puzzle last night . it one heck project -- approximately equivalent 200 slightly oversized daily crossword puzzles . i'm going love hanging puzzle my wall -- it really something behold when it all . but it also big undertaking requires great deal patience perserverance . puzzle itself moderately difficult , but made more so fact somewhere during revision ( it re-done once ) or perhaps during original construction some errors made . because this , many clues don't match answers . add fact author uses many hundreds , possibly even thousands , abbreviations specific certain field ( e.g. " abbreviation used electrical engineering " ) no lay person ever chance knowing , you've got what exercise frustration . you work hours one small section only later find out clue doesn't fit answer . i'm generally pretty dogged completing crosswords until letter perfect , but that not possible here . so i sacrifice bit my honor force myself give up after couple passes through ups downs . still , it 98+ percent solvable , which pretty good when you consider how intricate puzzle how hard it must create . overall , i enjoyed process am pleased result . if you've got time energy , i highly recommend this .	-1

" room " variable example , drops out . its not relevant . its who ait cake what time what drink . it just feels silly set up room pieces move room room if room irrelevant . idea probably change mechanics make game simpler . well , problem it pretty simple first place . change sort makes it more complex way . you need remember rooms where you already checked tokens . now sheet list rooms , you could use check off rooms where you checked tokens . but since rooms not otherwise relevant , its not intuitive track rooms where you checked tokens . game also incredibly cheaply constructed . example , " die " not numbers it , you put number stickers it . board isn't flimsy -- flimsy would improvement . anyway , not recommended	-1

i thought art certain charm , used strictly picture book children who can't yet read , i think it quite nice .

( granted , one those uses few hours ) . when level liquid low , machine stops making bubbles since it pick up enough liquid cover wand . we replaced it next year typhoon machine - this awesome , produced huge quantity bubbles worked more reliably since bubble liquid sucked up put wands , no matter how low supply liquid . it large reservoir bottom so you don't need fill it very often - it takes lot liquid though . our issue now getting liquid . gazillion liquid produce best bubbles - they last well , etc . etc . etc . however , very few stores stock liquid , except when i first bought first machine , o-o ne stocks large size bottles . even online vendors like toys.com who supposed them , never them stock ( i've their notify list long time ! ) i've ended up buying someone canada ebay - otherwise , buying smaller bottles toysrus , target , etc . just too expensive . both these machines don't really work if you try other bubble liquids - other liquids ( especially cheaper kinds very large size bottles ) much thinner liquid drips right off wands before it chance pass blower part make any bubbles . we're planning start making our own bubble liquid hopefully cover us . otherwise , machines useless now .	-1
i hate monopoly , but loved idea making my own game board . sadly , myoo so many limitations ! i gave it higher ed rating because you turn game into educational one , but it isn't intrisically educational . it doesn't print out spaces color bars , just little green squares you glue board below pre-printed color bars . background everything you print school bathroom green . you stuck lotto squares board ( bad me since i believe gambling evil ) . you only twelve good/bad news cards . i liked making my own money , though . i figured out how most same stuff word . here how : i took board " your town " clone monopoly measured big squares . i think individual squares 2.5 3.5 , but it doesn't matter , since your board may different . word , i used legal-sized paper ( i think that a5 you brits ) made table nine columns that how many my board ) two rows . then i messed it get proportions correct . you fit three rows one sheet legal paper , if return really small , like 5 points . gives you space cut . get color bars , get your cursor top row . type any letter . then highlight it , go up " format " click borders shading . click shading , click color , then make sure it says " cell " not text or table . i use only 15 percent most colors . click ok you should color bar . type whatever text you want . then click below type your property name . printing , i found last squares outside printing range , so i only eight squares next time print separate sheet " railroad " squares . corner squares 2.5 inches my board . i would recommend you make them bigger , then trim size , so you won't any dead space your board . cut glue board you picked up thrift shop or yard sale painted or covered . property cards . these actually easier than i thought . make table one column wide two rows deep . make it fill whole page . color above , type whatever you want . when you print them out , print out 8 or 16 pages sheet get cards . chance community chest ... well , what i came up using mail merge shipping label template . you just print out regular card or paper , cut . data file used merge would your classy one-liners . i don't know putting graphics . also , i can't figure out how use merge . i it once but can't figure it out now . money i haven't able . i quarkxpress adobe pagemaker but don't know how use either program . plus , i wanted make money paint or something simple . hope these directions help someone	-1

great company - terrible toy . my daughter got this toy christmas waited all day daddy bring home 4 batteries which not included . she excited until we turned it . 1 ) frame not secure open when you reach into middle change picture disk . 2 ) light not very bright not work mid-day light . 3 ) image quite small - only takes up middle 3 inches paper - not even close what pictured box . 4 ) clamps hold paper not easy tiny fingers use . 5 ) because small picture middle page clamps far edges , you can't shift paper re-use paper . you get one tiny picture middle standard size piece paper its waste . chalk board fine - but whole piece slides across table when you push draw . big disappointment . get some washable markers some tracing paper don't waste your money this suprisingly junky toy	-1

i bought quite few barbies amazon recently , including caligirl series , fashion fever series , barbie loves micky mouse . this barbie quite different all above . she not rubber skin like others , so we may see her leg joints if she wearing skirt or shorts . her foot quite flat ; only slippers this package fit her ; all other barbies ' shoes not . i guess this " pooh " might made " former generation " technology	-1

purchased 2 pairs my 8 9 year old daughters christmas . shoes made cheap pieces plastic . box includes bunches black , elastic bands you need really s-t-r-e-t-c-h onto shoes provide " bounce " . more your child weighs , more bands you use , but you double or triple them onto same hooks . they very hard install could dangerous if they snap back into your face while you installing them . once assembled , kids played them 10 minutes before becoming bored . they haven't played them since . don't waste your money	-1
oh my gosh-this terrible ! my husband i bought this game because i loved watching this child . this game uses same prizes games over over . if you played once you played too many times . games boring , prizes boring it waste money time . i don't know why box says " 13 up " because my 10 year old daughter could play this . this one going back store-i got zonked out my $24.99 ... if you want my opinion take cash run	-1

normally i am big fan little tikes name , but not so this product . i bought this my 2 1/2 year old daughter although concept cute , it not like other little tikes products . begin , train frequently comes off track . also activate it , you must press button where conductor goes . however , it difficult my daughter place figure this spot without it falling off . she often presses button process which activates train while she still trying put figure it which frustrates her . since this geared toddlers , you would think little tikes would put button activate motion different spot where figures go . also , age 2 1/2 she quickly bored it . she more fun letting it go floor across room than riding track . needless say , it going back . only good feature you " pack it go " away home fun	-1
don't waste your time this thing . time we invested toy , batteries , etc . we quite few dollars into it ... 15 minutes fun . toy can't just set down table , so when my son actually gone bored it ( my shock because he loves bubbles ) he tried set it down it spilled remaining gold solution all over . yuck . mommy promptly threw toy trash . this toy just gimmick - stick good old magic bubbles save your money	-1
idea behind this isn't too bad , my 4 year old really enjoyed them short time , but it some really ridiculous quirks . shoes not any type timer , so they stay indefinitely unless your child turns off each them individually . so what ends up happening , course , dead batteries within day or so . wand tiara both work fine , so maybe set wouldn't too bad , but it annoys me they would even release something ridiculous this	-1
i am very unhappy this product . handle hard turn , it takes too long clown pop up . when clown pop up it smells like forst fire inside toy . over all i would not recomend it	-1

this obviously re-release old " empire strikes back " kit released 80 . decent size kit ( approx 15 inches ) it gives experience modeler good opportunity super detailing . kit relatively easy build out box , but it many inaccuracies most notably inaccurate sensor/bridge deflector dome top ship . these inaccuracies addressed looking internet replacement parts articles addressing those inaccuracies . however , kit worth price . my only disappointment kit not scale new " republic star destroyer " " revenge sith " . new kit new movie over 19 inches long . order this kit scale current movie version , it would need 24 inches long . hopefully someone make " imperial star destroyer " scale .	-1

my husband i ignored many poor reviews choosing toys our 18-month old often pleasantly surprised see our son thoroughly enjoying such toys . unfortunately , this not case peg perego thomas ride-on train . he exceptionally tall strong his age , yet there no way his hand could possibly depress button required keep train moving , much less hold it down any length time . so operation train requires adult depress button spin circles while your child bats your hand away totally distracted experience . my son enjoys pushing train track more than riding it . however , train flimsy easily comes off track , so this usually lasts few seconds before he again frustrated annoyed . all this then you need get out screwdriver charge battery every time you " play " it . don't buy this toy or you kicking yourselves like we . it gimmicky piece plastic junk even major thomas-lovers probably not enjoy .	-1

my son ( now 4 ) loves cars , so when i saw this bed frame , i thought this it ! well , looks fool you . i also read many glowing reviews this bed frame , so i confident this must buy . but after using it while ( 1 year now ) , i am very disappointed . if i would buy bed frame , this one would not my shopping list . what i all my family don't like this frame : 1 . front end car frame shaped like sports car , so people hit protruding part all time when walking room , making people falter sometimes . 2 . since it made plastic , it gets really cold , it really feels terrible . i don't know why it damn cold all time . 3 . i exchange regular-height box spring half-height one , because regular-height box spring would too high sides bed frame would not provide adequate protection against falling . 4 . so many toys things fall mattress bed frame . i lift damn mattress then go into car frame pick up all junk my son loves shove into little openings . 5 . i think bed frame takes up way too much space twin sized bed . it waste space . 6 . my son disappointed wheels don't spin . i think he point , since this bed frame costs so much . my son now don't even think it cool thing . well , he stopped liking bed only after few days . 7 . head part bed also plastic , some reason , your head go under plastic , because head part comes over mattress . it quite annoying , we put pillow cover part frame . you can't even use it shelf since it not flat . dolls little toys we put up there would slide down hit our son or slide sides fall into corner where there big opening walls car frame . 8 . again , it very very cold , it really feels terrible when you want sleep night everything around you so cold hard . this miserable bed , i feel bad i bought this horrible bed my loving son . we gonna sell it 100 dollars ( we hope ) summer . only reason giving 2 stars because , it very solid	-1
my son received this gift . i love inside set up like " shelves " . my son loves organize his trains it . i don't like how thin metal . it dents easy cola . if it made better , it would worth money . save your money this one find something better made	-1
my daughter plays older round version sit spin daycare alot . all kids like it there . she got simon says version christmas her aunt it pretty much sucks . she tried play it every once while but got so frustrated we now just put it attic because she won't touch it it way . it doesn't spin very well all ( possibly due oval shape ?? ) no matter where my daughter sits it . also audio very loud annoying no volume control . also it seems much cheaper made than older style she plays daycare . i would say don't waste your money simon says sit spin - try find older one second hand store or garage sale . my recommendation playskool would go back original design - round sit spin , no sound - just pure simple fun	-1
my two year old absolutely would not leave store without this she still plays it year later . however , there two problems . one , it immediately needed repair basic connections , two , it pinching hazard basket frame . but course , my daughter never noticed either those . she simply loves play it , constantly , take it walks around block	-1

just everything negative said this doll said here , but i still feel i put my two cents . my daughter nine next month , always , she wants barbie doll her birthday . this one doll not only my daughter not getting , but one she never even see if i help it . little girls love things shiny sparkly glitzy , but this doll goes way beyond . doll looks like [ ... ] . clothes makeup just not make sense any other context . yes , it just doll , it parent responsibility -- not toy company's--to teach kids what okay what isn't . but you want your sweet little girl looking this imagining how pretty she look one day crotch-length skirt ?	-1

i bought two these toys my son , only child pretty gentle toys . it kept his bedroom away his playgroup . he not even played it regularly . yet both times these toys broke within months purchase !!! yes , it fascinating . like other reviewers , i've also some fun it myself . but i am disgusted it broke down so easily -- twice . there must reason amazon doesn't offer new ones sale ; please think hard buying new one elsewhere . unless you don't mind looking $30 you'll pay month or two entertainment , look other gear toys don't depend upon this lousy motor .	-1
my daughter , 6 , received this christmas . her 4-year-old brother also wanted play i t.t he first problem there no instructions included how put it together . this problem when you two antsy kids eager play it . i struggling getting various panels snap together solidly when , after repeated attempts , i happened look drawer underneath colored bulbs crayons , found -- what you know ! -- screws . then , after i put top , i realized i should installed light bulb first ( you need light bulb 25 watts or less , not included ) . then , when i thought i , i found i piece left over . arrgh ! extra piece clip supposed hold picture tracing . ha ! even after i installed it , there no tension clip very little chance it hold anything . there two drawers hold bulbs crayons . good idea . but some reason drawers catch stick . how hard it make drawers slide easily out ?	-1
i purchased this toy based excellent reviews it here amazon , it looked also like fun toy educational value . i am very disappointed . starters , my son finds it very frustrating front pieces eyes , face hat only go one order . he also trouble pulling pieces apart once they together , he very dextrous his age . also disappointing lack container store all pieces . without this , blocks loose my son toybox we never find all pieces . packaging could easily redesigned hold pieces . all all , it not toy he sit play without assistance , i thought it might . when he play it he enjoys it 15 minutes moves something else . we could without this toy under our christmas tree	-1

my daughter who turn 4 loves this game . she wants play it constantly . so it good their entertainment value but bad yours . dresses hard get dolls they rip tear very easily . it takes long set game up it take it . there also some sketchy directions such rolling dice but not go far die say but you can't go over numbers i.e. you roll 4 but you only want go 3 spaces then that allowed . that confusing when you're trying teach your kids their numbers how many spaces go but otherwise you'd rolling dice forever trying get one spot you're trying reach	-1

i got this gift my 18 month old son . it only produces one lousy bubble each pull handle , very sad . my son got very frustrated so i . i would not recommend this product .	-1
i consider myself fairly intelligent individual , growing up family where saturday spent working classic car garage , or watching football sunday , female , i know lot male stuff . even i couldn't answer hardly any " male " questions , since this game , men answer questions womanly stuff , women answer questions manly stuff . we played it twice now , even though men team always 1 male more touch his female side than most , women always gotten our butts kicked . it so one sided it not even funny . even men saying , it not even fun since game lasts basically 10 minutes . one men said he even think twice some " male " questions . if i anyone looking get good party game , i certainly wouldn't put my money out get this again .	-1
gave this heli my 30 year old son his birthday . it supposed easy fly . it rolled over crashed inches off ground its maiden flight , spewing propeller parts everywhere . all retailers out replacement parts it may never fly . if you buy this heli , don't buy it through mail or online but local dealer parts expertise help you get it back together	-1
actually , we love game very much but very disappointed pressman toys . here scoop : our game came only 20 pegs each color -- box clearly shows least 40 each color . we've called company 1800 80 0-0 298 186 several times but they refuse send us additional pegs . just bad business practice my opinion . saying goes , when you love something you tell few people , when you're not happy you tell everyone . i'll sure check i'm not buying items pressman toys next time . so instead returning game paying shipping we'll just win fewer steps . sigh !	-1

toy good idea , but it needs more user friendly , instructions hard follow , even adults , maybe not quite so much activities one time , could simplify some younger players	-1
3 stars overall only b/c we love c3 ! read ... batcave c3 set some rather intense structural integrity problems cause it next impossible put together without supplemental " fix-it " set distributed mfg . after many seasoned adults protested their frustrations its construction . since company now withdrawn all c3 items its website , it not known whether " fix-it " package still available ( it included thicker , stronger support pieces first floor , additional pieces stairway support column ) . without these , set tends implode well before you ever get 2nd level completed , let alone 3rd ! after all problems started surfacing , company also increased " recommended age range " 7+ previous 4+ . if you purchase box states 7+ age range , it should include " fix " parts ( no guarantee , we're only assuming ) , but even " fix " pieces , it still major headache put together , your true calling architect if you manage get it safely together first try . it takes most adults several tries over several days ( due frustration stress level ) get this piece fully assembled . there step-by-step construction guide showing problems ( " crash " pictures ) set construction , amazon rules say i can't post link here , but it shouldn't too hard find if you enter c3 batcave search engine , full write-up c3 forum . i know many people may still purchase -- it after all , batman , but i would least try see if you acquire replacement parts before ordering , you much greater chance success . or wait until you get package , if it says 7+ box , you just may luck . alternative , maybe you could use super-glue existing inadequate structural supports ? or , raid your kid lego stash use thicker , more stable blocks than ones supplied this set	-1

this best therapy game ever . my girls bought it me , gift because i love board games . we mostly played it their friends . i played my children several times found out some very interesting views they me . i decided bring it family gathering . i always distant my eight siblings . game started out kids my sisters ect . then when they saw i ok laughing myself they asked children leave just sisters played . we total awakening how we see each other . we never closer , since game our communication wonderful . this game best . we laughed so hard we ached next day . we played till 2:00 a.m. our husbands kept calling us asking when we going home . we started our game 9:00 p.m. told them we'd just hour or two . lol i instructed bring game this summers ge t-t ogether	1
it seems just every house our subdivision electric ride-on toy . there few " barbie " jeeps , few polaris atvs , one corvette three gators few others . my 4 year old daughter first gator owner . i must say , it expensive .. this thing far most expensive toy my daughter , bar none . should you buy your 4 year old $300 ride-on toy ? well ... that up you . but she loves her gator . she give up lot other toys get this one , but she extremely happy it . sometimes i wish i 40lbs so i ride this thing . she can't care less " barbie " thing , so this green utility machine fine her . gator slightly faster than others fat tires truck bed makes gator looks lot more serious than barbie jeep . truck bed really useful . although not recommended , she hauled two kids bed . 4 kids car , it still zoomed around street quite well . one time i loaded nail gun , air compressor , electric drill jigsaw panel saw all bed asked my daughter drive other side yard fix fence . i saw our neighbor hauling few bags mulch theirs . it made such funnt scene .. little electric toys carrying real tools stuff . very cute . enough fun stuff . problem 1 . battery location hassle recharge this thing . you open front grill sometimes latch pinch your finger . it hurts . problem 2 . left front wheel fell off while my daughter driving it . i tightened it again never happened . problem 3 . slipping tires . people complain tires very low friction . they slip very easily driveway grass . but this how it " protects " its gearbox so i don't really care , but i heard they expensive once they wear out . i think this best ride-on toy market today . if extra $[ ... ] won't hurt you too much , then consider gator . your children not disappointed .	1
i ought this my daughter her 1st birthday . she loves bead maze top she goes round round cube exploring all different sides ! so title would suggest , stickers cog wheels starting come off ( after 1 week ) . this doesnt affect functionality toy , just aesthetics . if you not bothered some bare cogwheels this still great toy ! it stands 2 feet tall top maze perfect height little ones . other 3 sides : abc pictures rotating blocks , abacus , sliding plastic pegs . only side stickers cog wheels so no worries other sides losing stickers . if they made cog wheels out wood or design painted or imprinted into plastic this toy would 10	-1

i looked everywhere plastic durable toybox , seems so simple but unfortunately no one kept anything stock look person . i took chance this one because price right , i'm very pleased . i like pockets front , my son loves putting his books out . if i would change one thing it lid . it lightweight not hurt little hands fingers ( which good ) , but never locked onto toybox , it lifts off very easily , so sometimes just bumping it causes it fall out shallow indentations it sits . other than we love it	-1

my daughters ( ages 5 2 1/2 ) given these dolls christmas . they love them play them every day , especially 5-year-old . i think littlest one may little too young really enjoy her fully , but she plays her when her big sister plays hers . i'm glad i didn't let some reviews discourage me getting these . all problems people limited english very easily remedied , if they read directions fully . first all , you must switch doll " display " mode , moving little switch her back . doll comes mode used so people try her out store . this mode , she only say one or two things english . one you move switch , you just " wake her up " hold button util she speaking english . point , she should speak english , even after waking up . however , if you turn her completely off via back switch , you switch her back english holding bracelet down . i really not problem , certainly don't spend time interpreting what she saying . that why they make directions - it tells display mode right front	1
this set perfect my daughter new toy oven ( miele ) she received christmas . pots pans sized just right utensils fit perfectly pots pans . one my utensils already broke apart , but happens . i 3 year old girl who loves cook , but she 3 not always careful . not sure whether utensil wasn't made well enough or it 3 year old play , but rest set seems fine . i would recommend this miele oven	-1

this large version michael myers lot beter than mcfarlane version released ever how many years ago . first pose better . second no blood stains ! don't get me wrong , michael myers movie killer , but he never got bloody ! my biggest complaint mcfarlane version . he slight oily looking stains his coveralls , but if you remember movie , he killed mechanic get those coveralls . finally third , pretty cool , sound effect diffrent . instead laurie strode whiny help me , you get halloween theme playing michael breathing . remeber end first movie , after loomis shot him , but body missing , closing shots shown theme music accompanied myers ' breathing . if you got neca boxed set michael myers loomis liked it , get this ! if you got mcfarlane version , get this ! if you just like halloween , get this ! you won't disappointed ! looks better person than picture	-1
we bought this toy our 1 year old son . it very sturdy well made blocks inside great . i agree other reviews wagon moves fast wood floors it not turn well . my biggest compaint , however , when both lids closed , wagon looks just like 2-step ladder . our son constantly tries climb it , like stairs . other day , he finally stood up top wagon wagon tipped straight over onto handle . my son fell over it crashed his face . there two rubber stoppers back wagon , but they not prevent it falling over . my son fine , but this toy very dangerous i not recommend it !	1

easy , straightforward interface ( instance , button each number ) navigation through cells . easy tell which numbers start puzzle which ones you entered . provides time-penalized hints any cell . pauseable saves your game ( aut o-o ff ) power sessions . most importantly , this device lets you make " pencil marks " ! i checked out least dozen products i yet come across electronic sudoku electronically lets me enter dots or xs indicate which numbers might ( not ) cell . it makes me wonder if people ordered design implement these games actually play sudoku themselves . closest i've seen let you enter multiple numbers cell it blinks through them , which i find cumbersome patience-trying . sadly , this thing doesn't electronic marks either , but their lower-cost solution involves dry-erase pen lets you make marks right screen , top little numbers printed each cell background . losing marks travel prevented recessed contours screen . why not 5 stars ? just fact marks aren't electronic , there no backlight , shadows cast dry-erase marks little disorienting . otherwise , well-done , fun , addictive product	-1

i bought this high chair my daughter second birthday because i love look it . similar chair made badger basket toys gets terrible reviews poorly constructed so i went this one despite it no reviews . i couldn't happier . this high chair solidly built easy assemble . i love white finish because it relatively neutral my daughter room may go through decorative changes coming years . i don't forsee her outgrowing this toy quite few years it sturdy enough last . she several dolls , largest her 17 " corolle lila , who fits beautifully chair . i would guess this chair could possibly handle up 20 " doll . while it solidly built , i am obviously discouraging my daughter sitting chair herself ( i've caught her trying several times ) because no doll chair should expected sturdy ! only real negative joke chair pad . i actually just tossed it because it doesn't really add toy play value anyway would probably just nuisance . i highly recommend this high chair child your life who enjoys taking care babies . it made me look kidkraft more toys doll furniture	1

my 2.5 yr old son loves this puzzle . i help him put it together he just loves challenge construction equipment . i like how tough pieces are- they held up even when stepped chewed baby . very nice	1
developers this game great job coming up questions designed appeal kids , questions like : if you could star movie , which movie would you choose ? if you could eat only one food rest your life what would it ? questions range simple bit more complex , so kids who like challenges well those who don't enjoy game . thing : although you follow rules play this strictly board game , we used it while we just sitting around table casual chat . sometimes kids asked question , sometimes adults ... but we all learned more one ... lot more ... many questions got us talking family history , memories , etc . lots fun ! it'd great take questions trip or while eating restaurant since they surefire conversation starters but not so personal anyone " personal boundaries " invaded . plus , there no right or wrong answers any information provided strictly voluntary , revealing much or little respondent wants . one caveat : you eventually go through all questions so this game won't last forever ... unless you able find new people participate . if so , it used years . terms fostering family closeness without any threatening or off-limits questions ( short , everyone play nicely together ) this great !	1

this set one most fun builds i've lego long time . adult fan lego , i highly recommend this set its minifigures part selection . they excellent additions any castle or general builder . builder , final construction impressive size ( 18+ inches long ) , functionality ( rotisserie chicken quite amusing ) , playability ( sea serpent posability incredible catapult alone stunning ) . catapult my favorite part . after seeing necrotic firing action lego exo-force mobile defense tank disk launcher ; rapid-fire , long-range viking catapult astonishingly fun play . lone drawback this set fragility ship hull . it should assembled hard surface ( i tried build it carpet ) slid floor , not carried ( it fold half air ) . few extra plate elements reinforce hull joints would probably improve this set	-1
i bought this set my son prior reading other reviews online but before i tried set it up . i admit reading reviews how difficult some people thought it put together they must exaggerating ... we'll apparently they not . i tried 10 minutes covered soap nearly hurt myself trying get first two pieces together ... so point i gave up waited my husbands help . two us spent nearly hour banging thing together every tool we had(after we washed off all soap b/c just made getting pieces stay together impossible)and once we center base up i pushed it it fell completely apart . we got it back together but there no way i felt it sturdy enought let my child anywhere near it . so desperation i called toysrus store where i got it spoke w/ store manager . she assured me this not how it supposed i should bring it back . i wasnt thrilled b/c it wasnt easiest thing get home first place ... but what choice i . i asked her if they would set next one up me make sure it worked b/c i wasn't go through this again . when i arrived store it all set up completely sturdy ... exactly what i wanted it when i purchased it . unfortunatly due its size we take it back apart get it home but once we my husband it back together 10-15 minutes just little banging rubber mallett ... just like some other reviewers said . so morale story ... if its miserable put together then its probably defective should go back ... but once its together properly its great .... now if my son would just show some interest darn thing all would good world !	-1

sooo cute . santa gave my 7 y.o. daughter dog cat versions this game . she i already spent several hours playing her " pets " . unlike earlier pets , there more than just care your pet . there games , activities interactions pet friends . there whole village homes places visit . you collect stickers throughout your adventures . instance there 29 stickers available making friends . it represented heart sticker . everytime you collect sticker , you taken your sticker book it indicates how many stickers available how many you obtained . there three exterior buttons use play , groom feed your pet . when your pet ignores you , it means it time grooming , playing or eating . sometimes your pet suddenly disappear then reappear their potty mat left little undesirable . my daughter thinks hilarious . kids ! only drawback screen not light up play while travelling after dark . maybe they'll improve upon next versions	1

i just got laser tag master blaster few days ago i love it . i've my eye it ever since i got deluxe my b-day back september . i looking amazon so frequently price drop i got tired watching so i stopped few months . then spring came i got into playing laser tag again my little brother . i suddenly filled urge buy ltmb . i looked back amazon ... boom ! 60 percent off ! 20 bucks ! i told my mom dad it they said i could get one . so next day we began ordering process amazon , through toys us . we checked shipping charges ... bam ! 15 greens ! so we just figured our next trip into town we could just go toys us see if it would same price . it ( minus 15 bones sh ) . so we picked up few went home . after reading instructions million times doing few tests i finally figured out how they work . i also found out they very much like deluxe , except shoulder stock , sights , fully automatic feature , 3 shot burst , shot range , text messages , who could ever forget rocket . let me explain laser tag master blaster you : this large tagger much better very large playing field . deluxe irt-2x models better smaller areas . ltmb laser shot range up one thousand feet . laser three different shot types : single ( fire one shot ) , 3-burst ( fire burst 3 shots , no overheatage ) , fully automatic ( fire non-stop ) . you also send text messages ( up 10 characters long ) your teammates opponents . retreat ... behind you ... gotcha ... ouch ! rocket awesome . just load , pump , launch , simple . just twenty pumps rocket sail over forty feet , blasting everyone 15 20 foot radius . there lot more ltmb but it would take long type , so you'll just figure it out yourself .	1

most old skool fans angry he not vw beetle anymore . i kinda never liked beetles anyway , so im happy new unlicenced thing . it looks like mix mini peugeot . he transforms better than most , picture does'nt him justice , it makes him look stiff . actually , how bulky he , he amazingly bendable , i particularly like his " door/shields " are'nt attached his arm , their cuffling rotates so they wont too awkward like many others " door/shields " . jetski jetpack adds unneeded extra flair already awesome robo mode . extra retro touch it tempurture sensitive decal his chest/top car must held minute before it reveal autobot logo [ just like his original 80s version ] . i wish he come some sort weapon , but i few other transformers this same generation don't really need both they came . what even more awesome me i bought this grocery store , one very few toys they thier christmas section , $10 if your looking just any one good transformer , bumblebee good choice . if you optimus , this one looks great standing beside him . transformer fans don't delay , pick this one up ! i can't wait see movie camaro bumblebee july	1

even though i'm convinced all monitors work differently different locations , this model treated us well . we got this monitor ( dual receivers ) my first daughter 3 1/2 years ago it always clear crisp . reception perfect basement , frontyard , backyard ... even neighbor house . one receivers konked out after 2 years but we survived only one . second receiver finally stopped working last week after doing waaaaayyyy too much internet research , i decided go same , trusty , inexpensive monitor it works great ! i've never slept monitor our room ( because our babies stay us long time ) so i don't know nighttime quirks . i keep monitor our kitchen area listen little one waking up naps .... spy girls when they play upstairs without me . :) baby #3 way i'm sure this monitor last 3 years until we don't need it anymore . so , $40 over course 3 children isn't bad !	1

this toy my son always wants play we've this dinosaur quite while now . usually , we buy our son toy he pleads ( he likes it soooooo much ) it looks like fun but then it ends up back his closet after few days playing it . this brontosaurus makes booming sound his feet when you pull trigger underneath which both my sons love ( 4 2 ) included figures great . this toy stands up brutual tug war accompanies our two small boys it quite bargain price . i highly recommend all dinosaurs cavemen this series . not only it keep my sons busy ( oh yeah ) but it also helps built their imagination i hear them tell each other all these stories their dinosaurs . imaginext even come out " new " dinosaurs this line which found target or other stores ( i found tru limited selection ) .	1
i agree denver reviwer totally out lunch . this doll greatly resembles my daughter friend jenny liu . jeeny born taiwan . chinese people don't look any one way expect them racist , like saying they all look alike . hair ornaments plastic but they look good . dress looks redder when you display her out box . fabric quality better than average mattel . her hair also much nicer more style than mattel giving us . i think this doll bodes well better things come this doll series .	1

this only figure apocalypse series dose not variant figure . kinda makes you wish it sentinel series , if you find them , most them variants you might actually want . i fortunate enough hit wal-mart time when shelves must just stocked , because racks full , all five variants right there front . needless say i bought all 5 . but maestro , far i know one appearance entire marvel universe , so what variant even possible . despite some protests this " hulk figure " this not some namby pamby rehashed hulk screaming action , fist pounding , slightly purplier pants we've seen dozen times before , but almost entirely all new figure . one reviewer said body based smart hulk figure , but i wasn't lucky enough snag one , so i don't basis comparrison . however , he well muscled , warty , weathered alot like he looks included issue captain marvel . if your wondering just what exactly him , fear not , captain marvel released series xv near end this year . then he go few rounds your maestro . now ml , where our legends 2099 spidey ? ( he also cm comic . ) he good figure , could little bigger , like more scale juggernaut series vi , but he come apocalypse piece whcich great figure itself	1
my one-year-old son great time playing these blocks ... he loved colors shapes . he really enjoyed knocking down my block creations . we such good time playing blocks i decided go on-line buy him some . i shocked price . i cannot believe [ what ] these blocks cost ... thirty-two foam blocks ?!?!?!?! forget it . it too bad these blocks cost restrictive ; they're great fun , but not worth price	-1

i've consistently impressed bionicle toys lego , rahkshi no exception . wish i young enough actually play this stuff . sigh . anyway , rahkshi take bionicle can-sold figures new new level articulation . total , joints found neck , shoulder , wrist , hip , knee , ankle , crank back swivels entire arm assembly side side so you whack things staff-like weapon each rahkshi weilds . then there opening case back so you flip spooky little rubber leech/slug things through air . each one these things appears come miniature cd full quicktime promotional stuff toys , game , web site , etc . voice bit melodramatic , but it still kind neat . i like 360-degree rotating model toy you just bought ... sort redundant , since you look one real life , but nifty all same . one thing mildly disappointed me rahkshi weapon isn't really independanly existing object - which say bar held " hands " only attached hands , not heads weapon . this isn't really big deal , except it means you can't figure hold weapon only one hand . this could rectified 2 small technic pieces , course , but it mean you'd add extra bits set somewhere else . overall , very cool build-it-yourself action figure could either set stand looming your monitor work , or actually played . educational value limited following instructions demonstration structural principles , any lego set . durability seems good so far - lego pretty sturdy stuff	-1

i think this toy just too cute . it bit pricey though . i would not suggest you purchase this toy young toddler ... maybe 2 1/2 3 year old . my daughter likes throwing it ground screaming delight ( she one half ) . she really likes it carries it around house . she little too young respect it properly i fear it may not last long . it really cute if you real stainless steal appliances your home . i bought this because my daughter taken keen interest my microwave i trouble keeping her away it . this toy solved problem . one minus it came no instructions how get table rotate . you play buttons little then you see how it operates . my daughter not systematically make turn table rotate ... her it happens randomly . she enjoys opening doors , pushing buttons , seeing light come hiding her real dinner there ( so parents beware ! ) . someone suggested it tiny unit ... so it , but all other toy microwaves i looked very similar size	-1

i understand people who install car seats who feel this item isn't needed distrust its lack crash testing , but my infant car seats hand-me-downs without latch . my car latch , but not seem kind seat belts stay tight . my car seat doesn't just get little loose ... you move it 4 or 5 inches side side if you try . it may car seat tech could train me better job locking clip , but i can't get it stop this . one seats given me without locking clip all . i no problem tightening seat belt enough - it just won't stay way . this product allows me tighten car seat enough meet " one inch " spec . nothing else . so it definitely adds my baby safety . finally- car seat techs- number these sold , it doesn't appear anyone come forward say it failed crash . just because it hasn't crash-tested not mean it unsafe . there absolutely nothing wrong aftermarket goods rule , tho manufacturers always tell you otherwise	1

i played " atmosfear , harbingers " vhs mid-90s several years later bought copy game through ebay . then , i saw this dvd update gave temptation when price marked down . here my judgement : 1 ) mechanics simplified . this it pros cons . it could made easier learn without removing many components . 2 ) gatekeeper less nasty/funny balance dvd update . 3 ) it major upswing his dialogue randomly disbursed . one reviewer seemed think game boring . i'll guess , instead , people he parties don't attention span board games . too bad them . atmosfear - dvd board game get b+ me	-1
this toy wonderful several reasons . one thing , it really only shape sorter your child ever need . it very basic shape sorting ( cut out holes sides one door opened any shape block go ) , plus pretty complex shape sorting when you open various locks . toy also helps teach colors animals , locks develop fine motor skills even further . overall , this toy very well made . it real wood , dove tailed together . it could , course , fall over , but if your child 18 months or older recommended this toy , he or she probably isn't small enough it hurt . locks this toy little more chintzy . they wobble , which makes locking or unlocking some them more difficult ... but you could look this just learning tool . my biggest concern blocks relatively small ; they could squeeze through toilet paper tube . this means they potential choking hazard , so you'll want supervise when your child uses this toy . all said , my 20 month old loves this toy plays it more than anything else she	-1

this game great way pass twenty thirty minutes . it very easy learn not any pieces lose , or money count . strategies , however , numerous , there equal amount luck skill involved good gameplay . i really liked how game could only played two people , i tired games could played two , but which really meant enjoyed three or more ... game contents : 1 deck game cards , one small board . note : if you want make this game really portable you don't even need bring board . it just place put discarded cards way help organize your cards . long you pencil paper scoring end game , you play it everywhere you table . ( i figure you need much space lay down your cards size typical monopoly board ) . playing note : one thing initially little confusing us when we reading instructions , instructions not explain you place your cards opposite side board your opponent . you each play all 5 expeditions , head head manner . we sitting couch coffee table , we turned board horizontally face us ( instead vertically ) instructions confusing until we moved board 90 degrees . game designers assumed you would play game one would play game checkers , sitting across one , but you don't actually play this way , even though you need turn your board same effec t.t his game really fun i would highly recommend other games same manufacturer ( rio grande games ) . they really knack publishing great strategy games . they even release expansion sets their popular games , they credit players who gave them ideas expansion cards . pretty neat	1

i bought this game two weekends ago both fun frustration it . i'm freecell junkie gone so far download better version ( more games ) than one came my computer . i lost track how many total games i've played over years since i've used several computers , but i play 10 games day average . i'm very competitive love keeping track my stats . unfortunately , weakness this version game . example , if you get into position you move only one card back forth two columns there no other moves , all you hit replay button or move game . if you hit replay button you don't get loss recorded , which course you should . consequently , it easy run up high win percentage this version game just resigning game when you think you going loose replay it . then when you finally win , you get credit win . course , not proper scoring either . also , there key combination when you lose game outright want replay , you don't get any further losses counted against you . that it should . only problem key combination very flaky doesn't always work . other than scoring inconsistencies , it great game ! it very easy use . although different use than playing mouse your computer , if you've played lot your computer you'll pick up operation this version almost immediately . display large easy see , there low light level sensor front automatically light screen when you playing area poor lighting . great feature . i love playing this game while sitting airport waiting board plane plane itself while air . it great challenging way pass time away if you like playing solitaire . next version this game , i hope they beef up statistics capabilities unit	-1
this christmas gift , person loved it . i so happy i chose this website purchase !!	1
after three years dragons who walk all fours , we get dragon who stands upright . seems kind strange . thoron debut appearance " fire ice " portal fire set . he makes appearance here metal ages , he looks lot meaner here . perhaps rigors battle wearing him . i bought stendhal first very pleased him . i found thoron somewhat disappointing . he got some great detail , but he not articulated stendhal . replacing standard light-up feature dragon roar feature . thoron doesn't light up , but he variety growls roars activated button his chest . his articulation pretty decent . his hind legs ( which he stands ) stiff only move back forth . but it gets much better when we examine his arms head . his arms move back forth , away his body . shoulder joint move two directions . we get two additional points articulation elbows wrists . thoron wrists aren't versatile stendhal ( stendhal wrists turn addition claw moving back forth ) . his neck move left right , his head move all manner directions . always , his jaw opens . his tail flexible super-posability , his towering wings . he also turn waist . my complaints thoron articulation twofold . it would've nicer if his hind legs posable , it definitely would've nice if his wrists articulated like stendhal . thoron mostly dark green white highlights his wings , white claws his feet , silver colored armor . mentioned , detail here better than ever , everything realistic look . he comes removable piece armor his head . i think he looks better without it , but maybe that just me . thoron one most charismatic dragons i've seen ( it all face eyes ) . he looks kind mean vicious . stendhal supposed bad guy , he doesn't look this mean . original thoron fire ice series better facial expression . this action figure comes almost completely assembled . i just attach his wings . also included some parts building small tower decorative blades flag , draigar warrior shield weapon . all things considered , thoron isn't quite nice stendhal . nevertheless , he gets thumbs up me . he good addition any dragons collection fun action figure play around	1

this first rc ( radio control ) aircraft i ever flown , although i raced rc cars quite awhile . it comes fully assembled nice manual even quick intro dvd get you air quickly . i started out my living room it worked just great . just little trimming out heli very stable easy which get feel . i've run it few hours now no incidents i'm getting pretty good hovering although i still tough time head-in flight ( controls thus reversed ) . blade cx rtf makes great first heli or just great indoor heli . probably fine anyone over 10 years old . i am getting 10-15 minutes flight time battery charge . only disappointment charging battery takes 60-90 minutes ( typical all lipo batteries ) . i'd recommend getting extra battery or two maybe even extra powersupply charger . also i tried training gear add-on blade cp/cp pro -- it fits cx just fine allows you use it later if you move -- it helps damage but makes blade cx slightly less stable hover my opinion but not terribly so . they're probably worth trade off first . few more hours i think i'll ready move up blade cp pro . highly recommended anyone interested entering rc helicopters or who just wants heli fly around house . two good sites further info [ ... ]	1

my 4 1/2 year old recieved this red engine last christmas , first couple months used practically every day . ( yes , i agree rest reviewers- buy rechargable batteries since this engine eats them , prepare disappointed since it cannot pull many cars up hills without getting stuck . ) i tell you i cannot believe my son not touched this engine since . his complaint all it go around around . instead , he enjoys playing out stories thomas , or making up his own train sagas . my husband likes watch engine more than my son . i don't know how other children play their trains , but battery operated engines just cannot hold his attention very long . nevertheless , first few months , watching it really mesmerizing , i could watch it hours . perhaps instead buying this one engine , purchase setup more cars track same money . it probably get more use end	-1

i love melissa doug toys , they're always well-made always thoughtful . they encourage learning their pieces , made natural material , not only hold up well but environmentally friendly . this game particularly nice example . it classic wooden puzzle twist . each vehicle puzzle piece magnet it players yank them out magnetic " tow truck " . melissa doug made two other puzzles similar this , fish puzzle butterfly puzzle , same concept . this one , however , might appeal more kids whose current fascinations lie more lines cars trucks . one our pieces ( fishing version this puzzle ) stick , but quick rub around edges some sandpaper loosened it right up . downside using real materials wood tendency warp humidity or dryness . that downside i'm willing live ! excellent toy !	1

i lot research internet regarding play food before i bought this set . this set offers largest variety foods , covering all food groups , minimal amount desserts ( i want healthy eater ) . this play food set eggplant , cauliflower , asparagus , chicken , steak , ham , hot dogs , hamburger , bacon , pineapple , lemon , honeydew musk melons , any many more items - incredible selection foods . i received exactly what shown picture internet . food very high quality just right size play kitchen fit play plates . my daughter , husband i great time this food . she loves making us breakfast , lunch , dinner , snacks . she also likes put it her shopping cart we purchased separately ring food up pretend cash register . comments packaging ... packaging costs money which built into cost food . why this food doesn't cost lot , because step 2 saves money packaging . plus most people toss packaging anyways after opening item . packaging clear plastic so you see all items . this set larger variety food than little tikes , fisher price , just like home ( i never saw anything kid connection play food during my research ) . person who received 8 hot dogs , 12 french fries , etc . should contact step 2 ask reship . there must mistake made when packaging ( probably rush holidays orders ) . you should get exactly what shown internet . i hope this review helps everyone . fun this food ! it great buy !!	1
if you looking play food like little tikes or fisher price , this not it !! there reason you get 101 pieces 19.99 !! these pieces much smaller made thinner cheaper plastic . not all what i expected quality company like step 2 . top it off , this set not come retail box but cheaply packaged plastic bags . i am sure my daughter doesn't mind these cheaply made or small but i sure heck . i could bought kidconnection set walmart less money maybe even better quality	-1

" microwave " so high she can't even reach it small stool i bought her use just kitchen ! back little bins open , you can't store anything there . so , i don't know where they came up lots storage line ! i just expected little bit more kitchen -- would changed some features . overall it proven fun toy , but hard use unless you really tall	-1

parents find songs really annoying !! :) my baby thinks this greatest toy ever ! he 10 months old these two months so far . he loves taking pots out putting them back getting them play music , over over over over .... we put it away every once while so it doesn't drive us crazy , but baby , it great !	-1
my son loved learning table so i really thought pots pans would big hit when i purchased them when my son 8 mo old . i could not get product say anything but , " red pan , red pan out " . i called hotline fisher price they told me change battery which i already . while i phone , my son dropped pot it began sing alphabet song . cust . service rep. told me pots said sang things random it reponds when manipulated like child would . i disapointed because toy responds very randomly usually only sings if it shaken very hard or dropped . i really feel i wasted my money this one	-1
i've got this thing my twins ne = ew year , they've enjoying it one day so far . we two sets , it much more fun than just one - going one shooter against two robots indeed deathwish . i don't know how durable it prove - robots suffered some tumbles without ill effects , but it only one day . one drawback i found toy inability go shooter shooter - some reasons pistols , when set team team , refuse shoot one . but it fun toy nevertheless . only educational value i discern this set little bit understanding just how stupid computers , may realization light " bullet " gets reflected off white surfaces , so robot canshoot you even when its back turned toward you . otherwise , not eductaional all . thankfully :)	-1

( i watched " little princess " believed all dolls alive ) but baby born me more than doll . i recamend baby born all little girls- women who said baby born ugly- well i dont know other adults but adults my parents knew thought my doll real baby- until they would see me spin her they would heart attact then realize its doll ... they all thought life like adorable . i love baby born i am now going buy one my cousin jordan her first real baby doll .	1
i purchased this kitchen last christmas my girls . when it arrived , both my husband i amazed quality . assembly instructions(although it takes few hours ) very clear all parts pieces color coded numbered . i consider this piece " furniture quality . " top it off , it absolutely adorable my girls ( 2 4 ) love play it . it definitely type piece passed down generation generation . if you considering purchasing some kitchen sets pricier mall/catalog stores ( you know which ones i am talking ) , consider this first .	1
we bought this our girls ( 4 2 yrs ) last christmas so we last year model so i vouch how well this held up . they still love it play it daily . great wooden design sturdy construction , but let me tell you this no small undertaking assemble ; it easy but time consuming . if i only could paid santa assemble ! other than , compared other wooden kitchens , it great product this price point much better quality than plastic ones make noises etc . it larger reality kids use their imagination don't need all other stuff . my girls cook , bang , open doors shove stuff it it takes it like champ ! only drawback primarily made feminine colors so if you little man loves cook target now carries great little wooden kitchen blue stainless steel look it plus they carry great wooden food accessories .	1
i just purchased this game my 3-1/2 year daughter . she dora fan , so she wanted play it immediately . she sat there played entire game one sitting . basically , dora boots adventure help find pieces tico aircraft . swiper makes his regular appearances well . i help her understand how something couple places , but otherwise it right her level . she knows her numbers colors she very excited she able progress . best part game , my opinion , your little one able make jumps without any problem . pooh game her other favorite ( great game ) , but she needs help making some jumps . dora game , dora won't fall if you keep walking when you supposed jump - she just leans over his tippie toes like she going fall . my daughter especially proud fact she able jump swinging vines . i highly recommend this game !	1
i waiting this game come out my daughter reward potty training . my daughter just turned 3 this game very easy her navigate , previous poster stated some other v-smile games hard control . graphics characters voices if your watching cartoon dora . this game also very educational teaching spanish english colors numbers . also they teach animal sounds recognition animals ( both underwater farm animals ) . today first day we it so i'm sure i'm missing lot this review , but this game far best v-smile game them all we all v-smile games ( we keep up date when new games come out ) .	1
we bought this kitchen my 3 yr old son christmas . after searching through other kitchens we decided this one many reasons . first we liked it not huge overbearing , minimal sounds electronic functions there still plenty room using his imagination which important us . both burners light up , one makes " frying " sound , other " boiling " sound . it compact enough move around easily , we like keep it kitchen well living room outside nice days . secondly we liked chicco got it right regards usually discriminating gender biased kitchen sets pinks purples . subdued primary colors used chicco kitchen making it appealing both genders . lastly price this kitchen bargain compared others out there , especially since we not sure how much my son would really use it . although my son played it company child ease , i would reccomend getting something bigger if you two children constantly playing kitchen it rather small or conjunction other kitchen items placed near it like microwave or coffee pot , so focus not just one item given time	1
my one year old son loves play toy kitchens whenever he sees one , but i not want pay big $$ toy kitchen . i am so glad i found this one . he 13 months old it perfect him . very inexpensive but very cute fun . he not yet walking , so i just put it up against wall . so far , it not tipped over once . it perfect kitchen him . he already pretends cook eat play food included . my husband also liked fact it not girlie any way	1
i ordered this particular bunco set because company description said it pink ! i received very ugly cream red set .	-1

very interesting spoof original game . i found first one boring after few plays , but this one still interests my kids i after 10+ plays . it bit convoluted put it together initially , but well worth it	-1
this extremely fun addictive game . you shuffle cards , place three ( room , weapon , person ) secret envelope . every room you go into , you make accusations . if someone card you accused ( like room ) , then they show it you you write it down your notepad . game changes constantly , so it never gets boring . character pieces teeny details , like mr. green straps buckles his briefcase . i gave it 4 stars education because it teaches you focus really think . oh , good problem-solving skills too . coordination ( you add all clues up see who it ) . all all , terrific game . great rainy days or playdates . i mention weapons ? very realistic . cute	-1
i bought this game long time ago but unfortunately all my friends busy until x'mas . there 5 us once we started playing , we all addicted ! i heard some other friends commented clue boring game , but we all found it fun challenging ! apart strict logic thinking , keys win ask right question make good , well organised notes ! last time we played we 5 players , so some us got 4 cards hand some got only 3 hands . bit unfair because players 4 cards more clues beginning so their chances winning higher . so we tried one game open 3 cards table , game finished lot more quickly . but we all found it less challenging . overall , great game !! train you brain logic thinking much sudoku mastermind	1
child , i myself grew up candyland . now i children my own , my house wouldn't same without it . we got this game when my son 3 my daughter 2 . both kids understand concept game enjoy playing i t.t he best thing this game there nothing really complicated . kids don't even know their colors play . they just need match up color card color board . game simple enough kids often win which makes game more enjoyable them	1

i eyeing this kitchen two christmas ' . we knew this year we definitely going purchase kitchen set our 4 y/o , 2 y/o , 10 month old . it just matter finding one durable , fun stuff , options fun all three kids . we wanted something big enough two kids play , something would grow our family . this kitchen definitely met all my expectations . we purchased this directly manufacturer they offering free shipping until end last year . i took advice other reviewers made sure put stickers first . step 2 website great video demonstration putting this together . electric screwdriver nice , but there some tricky angles might require regular one . i would definitely expect spend least hour putting it together . but just think , you only put it together once . i it alone , but it would helpful extra set hands . kids love this kitchen . our 10 mo . old isn't old enough truly understand cooking , but she loves open close cabinets oven , pull drawers out , put things out sink . our 2 y/o more imagination enjoy actually pretend cooking . he understands it loves all space available . our 4 y/o isn't really " cooker " , but he plays this too . i like all storage space this kitchen provides . doors cabinets aren't all sturdy , but they get job . they definitely aren't quality countertops or main structure . there sounds microwave , dishwasher , oven , phone , stove . said , first three mentioned basically same " sound maker " , just different sounds coming out . stove neat , especially clear pots . i'm sure there many other kitchens out there more " wow " factor far " lights sounds " . i am definitely pleased this kitchen , it worth wait . it take up some space , but nothing i didn't measure out before we decided purchase it .	1

i thought this would toy my daughter would grow into not excited first . this first toy she opened christmas only 19 months not interested any others rest week ! she enjoyed collecting fingers " counting " them . she also grown last few months putting puzzle together herself although fingers might not make it correct hand just yet . very durable , love it traditional wood toy doesn't flashing lights or needs batteries ! she still loves it months later . only downside any toy like this , we collect pieces after she put them various places around house .	1

if you interested this kitchen because you would like expose your children new languages , i would keep looking . my goal expose my daughter french , but quality voice so poor i barely understand what said english ! quality construction fine but , frankly , you're paying added bonus languages it simply isn't worth it . i would recommend looking regular kitchen , whose design you like , finding way introduce language	-1
we bought this kitchen set our daughter christmas . thinking since it little tike it would best buy would stand up young child . i bought little tike before . but i'm not sure i again . refrigerator door doesn't even come close fitting . oven door warped one side doesn't close . it repeats same phrases over over . tape shipping left ink doors . we very disappointed whole kitchen set	-1
i purchased this my 2 boys , 5 3 , february . got it clearance walmart $19 , but would not wanted spend much more it . i debated whether get this or kitchen made cooking sounds but didn't speak 3 languages , since we're trying raise our children bilingual ( least ! ) we thought talking kitchen would preferable . unfortunately , voices hard understand - not they're soft , but there seems lot mumbling static , so if you don't know exactly what voice saying already , you wouldn't able learn , example , spanish word bacon " tocino " - it sounds more like " poseena " . beyond , however , both boys enjoyed it . it little small 5-yr old now but they both still play it . they occasionally get frustrated only cookie sheet fit into oven ( you can't put pot or nearly any other cooking vessel our other playsets ) . reason this obvious- sensor talking feature top oven , thus order close enough food sensor respond whatever there , floor oven raised rather high . if i it again , i would probably look kitchen set only cooking sounds not talking feature , it just not used often this house .	1

what bunch junk ! upon opening megaland , i noticed it ripped seam one area . this pretty large rip i might add . after inspecting it more i noticed dozen more places where it ripped . i noticed parent said same thing . now i know why it half off ! don't waste your money .	-1
it good toy but balls rather small youmust check seams when they arrive poor sowin	-1
let me start saying my son this toy over three years it his absolute favorite . since he it so long i tell you its very durable . we haven't any problems . this one only toy he used every single day since we bought it . he uses it pretty much everything , but especially cleaning up . he uses it gather up all his toys take them his bedroom put away . he also loves use it play store . only problem this toy : when his friends come over they want play it too ! maybe i should get few more them ! i would highly recommend this toy anyone !	1
this product fun my 2 year old . she loves push it around her dolls riding inside . parents , it easy thing use help clean up toys it decent sized basket it rolls pretty easy	-1
i remember reading lotr i loved series peter jackson version . once i heard monopoly edition lotr , i excited . i soon won lotr monopoly edition . i came home , invited some relatives soon great time ! you know , monopoly game inwhich you ultimate monopoly . you buy sell property , if you own mt . doom bara-dur ( boardwalk park place original monopoly ) then you get monopoly . you build strongholds ( houses ) fortresses ( hotels ) everytime rival lands your property , then he give you power ( money ) . if you can't pay rent then you'll become bankrupt you out . you also avoid jail . there some new tokens resemble characters lotr . if you look screenshots this monopoly game then you'll notice lot changes . but there new optional rule you play this version ; everytime you roll " eye sauron " ( also counts one ) golden ring move one territory per eye , where you add strongholds . if you land territory ring , you may get it free ! if you land owned territory ring it , you pay double rent . so , if you 100% die-hard lotr only enjoy books , then you miss . but if you looking monopoly board or lotr stuff , i recommend this game thennote : if tolkien lived see this , he would died immediatly . infact , i think he rolling his grave i am typing this review .	1
i hard time finding dishes someone under 3 years age . these perfect 2 year old . she really enjoys them , loves making " soup hot " her daddy . it includes pots pans little spatula serving spoon so she learns how use these things . it helps dexterit	-1
my one year olds twins received this christmas discover sounds kitchen . my daughter sticks her hand down ball drop hole pick up ball instead getting ball side pocket . once she ball her hand , she cannot get her hand back out hasn't figured out drop ball . this happened three different times . once , she walked off dragging workshop behind her until i caught up her . she not injured , but very upset . i sit right next her when she playing workshop , or put it up . my twins use discover sounds kitchen more often we not any problems it .	1
my son received this workshop 8 months still plays it all time 19 months . he mostly enjoys dropping balls through chute cramming things into overhead compartment . we also bought discover sounds hammer sold accessory , but it really too heavy him use first . he still doesn't pay much attention it . light-weight hammer comes workshop just fine . workshop durable also . my daughter sits nails , so far it held up well	1
my son received this toy christmas last year when he 9 months old . he now 18 months old still doesn't play it . it just doesn't hold his interest . other hand , he could play all ; day plain old little tikes workbench . this definitely not worth money - there more entertaining work bench toys out there	-1
i purchased this game 5 years ago searching more because all my family friends wanted their own copies ! we familiar fundex toys ( phase 10 ) wanted family game ages 6-86 could play together this game ! rules easy , game never same , everyone fun	1
this my son favorite toy . he playing it since he month old . he loves here it jingle , open flap see panda bear . he now 4 months old it still his favorite toy . i give him this play his bouncy seat it keeps him occupied long time . i've also attached it his baby gym he loves grabbing it . highly reccommend it	1
i know amazon description says this babies 3 months 2 years , but i just buy this early after i read all great reviews . when it arrived , i attached it activity gym ( i uploaded photo it if you interested seeing how i this ) . my baby boy , benjamin , immediately grabbed it . he only 6 weeks old time , so i am sure it just coincidence , but it made me feel bad i not offered him toys level he could reach before this . throughout first day , he became fascinated toy . he quickly learned how grab ( even though his depth perception still off ) i believe this toy helped him develop his " grabbing skills " faster than if i not purchased this toy . i am sure this toy going get lot use my baby boy . he now decided it more fun kick it than grab it . personally , i believe this toy should lower age recommendation . he only half way there i know i could given it him sooner .	1
i bought this my 5 year old son christmas . not only he think it great but also his 7 9 year old sisters . there so many games there something all them . we took toy us grandma even older cousins found it very fun entertaining . i really like they play all games spanish too . once they got hang game english they it spanish it helps increase their vocabulary . i little nervous if it would worth $50 because i seen barbie laptops some others radio shack . this one seemed like best choice hoping this would worth it . my opinion it much better than others we tried store i would definately recommend it	1
my two little girls , 2 3 years old , love this table use every day . i bought it month ago it still their favourite toy . they love it so much they want eat their meals it also . it expensive but well worth money . i love fact there enough space benches their friends sit create . table also large enough each child their own drawing space	1
i ordered three sets these dora dolls . they cutest thing i seen . i know my 2 4 year old granddaughters love them . they appear well made . fabric stores carry fleece " dora " material . i bought some made doll blankets it just cutting fringe around outside . i can't wait until christmas see their eyes light up when they see dolls matching blankets	1
my children i very happy big sister dora . my 18 month old baby sleeps dora baby brother sister her hands . my three children enjoy playing doll , they love putting babies dora carrier . i wish they also sold babies separately	1
i bought this my daughter when she 6 months old . she played it absolutely everyday since then ( she now year ) . six months she didn't really play it way it meant played but she enjoyed banging pans around listening music . now she works stacking them using shape sorter . great toy grow	1
i bought this because she age stacking things . i thought this would perfect her . however it not enough . there only two things stack spoon doesn't really place it . also numbers it doesn't any interaction it , meaning it just printed toy i t.t he sorting shapes great idea however it very durable . she bang it spoon well . i guess price i disappointed . but she fun it	1
i am now college- studding teacher . i however got orriginal " baby born " doll when i one . it my first doll ever i still her . i named her molly when i three would carry her every where . i course orriginal didnt much todays baby born- mine not cry , make noises , go potty but i imagination my eyes she real . ( i watched " little princess " believed all dolls alive ) but baby born me more than doll . i recamend baby born all little girls- women who said baby born ugly- well i dont know other adults but adults my parents knew thought my doll real baby- until they would see me spin her they would heart attact then realize its doll ... they all thought life like adorable . i love baby born i am now going buy one my cousin jordan her first real baby doll .	1
it beautiful kitchen - my 3yo loves it - i bought lot food stuff go it she gets total kick out it . microwave plastic came cracked it so involved putting it togetherthat we didn't bother un assembling it sending it back	-1
we bought this our girls ( 4 2 yrs ) last christmas so we last year model so i vouch how well this held up . they still love it play it daily . great wooden design sturdy construction , but let me tell you this no small undertaking assemble ; it easy but time consuming . if i only could paid santa assemble ! other than , compared other wooden kitchens , it great product this price point much better quality than plastic ones make noises etc . it larger reality kids use their imagination don't need all other stuff . my girls cook , bang , open doors shove stuff it it takes it like champ ! only drawback primarily made feminine colors so if you little man loves cook target now carries great little wooden kitchen blue stainless steel look it plus they carry great wooden food accessories .	1
i just purchased this game my 3-1/2 year daughter . she dora fan , so she wanted play it immediately . she sat there played entire game one sitting . basically , dora boots adventure help find pieces tico aircraft . swiper makes his regular appearances well . i help her understand how something couple places , but otherwise it right her level . she knows her numbers colors she very excited she able progress . best part game , my opinion , your little one able make jumps without any problem . pooh game her other favorite ( great game ) , but she needs help making some jumps . dora game , dora won't fall if you keep walking when you supposed jump - she just leans over his tippie toes like she going fall . my daughter especially proud fact she able jump swinging vines . i highly recommend this game !	1
my son neo ( 4 1/2 ) got this game yesterday we opened it he played all way throught learning adventure out stopping . controls this game seem alittle more responsive than older games . dora speaks both english spanish : colors , numbers , animals . if you going get smartridge this one get	1
no more quick-swingers sitting pitches , frustrating even most creative movement pitchers . now , quick twist red centerpiece , wiffle ball added new pitch - real fastball ( without wiffled movement ) - keep those batters check . this ball amazing things little changeable ring . i just wish quality little better so red ring wouldn't fly off easily after well-hit pitch , which also sometimes causes ball start cracking around center . but said , junk ball easily lasts least one 7-inning , tw o-o ut game . , oh , trickery	1
even my 4-year-old play this game ease ( albeit someone older reading cards until he got familiar rules ) . skills required play game skills transfer easily everyday life ... decision-making , strategizing , taking setbacks stride ... plus it tons fun ! i highly recommend this game both kids adults	-1

i needed kitchen my 3 yr old daughter would fit into very small space ... but one enjoyable play . we received it very quickly , time her birthday , although she not played it yet ; i test run it it seems made very well ; especially price . it small but many different little areas she work either slide out or open up . it would probably difficult more than two children , max , really play this same time ( again b/c size ) unless they some other accompanying toys like table chairs so one child could chef others could help preapre food table or customers , taking turns , etc ... tipping over part reviewer mentioned , hers against wall ; i think most people their toy kitchens so i dont think would problem . all ; good basic kitchen great price	1
my 3 year old my 1 year old play so nicely together this toy . my only complaint it could heavier bottom ; it toppled over couple times . otherwise , it great ; they love ' burners ' which make noise light up . i bought some more accessories because there not too many included	-1
this kitchen everything larger play kitchens , but it takes up third space . my daughter received this one her second birthday she enjoys cooking daddy breakfast it almost every morning . when her friends come over play , it usually first thing they go -- even older ones ! i highly recommend this anyone wanting buy their child(ren ) small , but very functional kitchen	1
my oldest daughter got older version this product her 5th birthday . she could only play couple games time , but she loved it . three years now it her all-time favorite car toy . it dropped , banged , kicked , stepped , fought over , everything else two kids could it 3 years , still works great ! drawbacks : pixter leapster caught kids might actually want play their toys past 5pm car put lcd lighting , but this company hasn't caught yet . also , no headphones jack -- some games make incredibly annoying noises ! one more thing -- ages not appropriately labeled . closer first grade up	-1
i am mother two elementary aged children who love art projects . this christmas gift i never so disappointed quality this item . it arrived crayons broken ones weren't , you couldn't even use paper . markers dry caps don't stay . this terrible product price ridiculous !!! definitely would better off purchasing these items elsewhere !!	-1

i loved electronic talking battleship kid 1980 anxious recently play this game again . i always excited looking through back play booklet when picking out board . i also always nervous when opposing player would hit red button , firing their missile . you hope they'll miss but you'll get bit nervous once they manage hit one your ships . you also hope they won't sink all your ships before you figure out where their ships . other hand , when you're one pressing red button , you're eager hear crashing sound - hitting one your opponent ships . good feature this game you play someone or you play against computer . when someone plays against computer , one usually loses . but i recall kid beating computer few times so that not case here . all , electronic talking battleship worth money bring many hours entertainment . great investment ! - donna di giacom	1

my son three yrs old 42 inches , we keep it next last highest setting it enjoyable him we probably need put it highest setting soon probably need bigger one next summer . he alot fun it although it not very tall or not ability go tall some other models , he still fun trying aim shoot hoop so we use it practice these skills before buying . you definitely need fill base sand before using ( not use water substitue ) it tip over repeatedly without sand per directions . overall just like any basketball set this one provides great outdoor/indoor fun well exercise durable compared others its price point . we not problems height adjustment bar or any parts falling off my son rough this toy b/c i not fill sand right away it fallen numerous time seems wearing well . so i think it great deal price	-1

i agree previous review you get what you pay . but future i would highly recommend paying more once instead replace this food few months or so . we received this gift outside it looked like great choice ! i very happy . but we this package food one week i am already taping boxes packaging tape keep them together . little hands pull apart milk , juice snack boxes no time . cans food so small they topple over easily play kitchen . pies , pizza , such food all actually hollow underneath . there no base them . they tell you 101 pieces but our kit it counted 8 hotdogs ( without buns ) , 12 individual french fries same potato chips . not necessary especially since you also get two french fry packets french fry container you get hot dog bun separately . why would my child want four jalepenos too . so much this food not they type thing small child would familiar . anyway , my opinion spend money smaller quantity higher quality food or go online find " vintage " fisher price or little tikes food . now those made last good size small hands .	-1
my daughter recieved this kitchen today , she absolutely loves it ! bins left side really need back them so things don't fall out . i would recommend putting this toy together ratchet equipped screwdriver bit adapter otherwise you sore wrist because it takes while get screws through thick plastic parts . this toy definately designed durable . i am sure it withstand whatever my daughter could it . overall i think it good investment very cute toy	1

i bought this our three-year old daughter . this product not made three-year old headpieces not fit properly into actual head . my daughter became frustrated trying play this toy so her 10-year brother tried help her out . he couldn't even get head pieces fit . you force piece into head squeezing plastic forcing it . decided throw whole thing away after my finger pinched forehead headpiece . again , don't waste your money	-1
my 6 year old son got this his birthday it first toy he wanted play , so once his guests left we set it up started playing . it comes six different themed 9-hole courses , we played all six once , they all fun their own way unique obstacles . lowest score each course gets saved player gets input his name future bragging rights . design toy unique . you aim turning dial top toy , you use club long-handled lever so you don't need bend over strokes . once your shot set up you swing club over " golf ball " part toy , how fast you swing determines on-screen speed your putt . unfortunately my son managed whack toy several times during our evening play , when we set it up this morning round he hit toy couple more times . problem compounded because while real golf you watch ball intention actually hitting it , this game you feel compelled watch on-screen action while swinging above ball . our game this morning ended when on-screen picture started flicker toy finally froze 9th hole ; freezing much same way your windows computer locks up . turning toy off resolved problem but our next game we got just 4 holes when problem returned game froze once again . while i'll acknowledge toy take several good whacks my son , i'd expect more toy designers should anticipated would get hit , hit frequently . we'll return this our local toy store exchange it , perhaps we just got faulty toy . we'll know within couple days if problem just we got faulty toy , or if mb dropped ball this one	1
christmas approaches , i thought i would give counter argument all these wonderful reviews gator . i received gift my two boys ( aged 3 5 time)2 years ago . initially gator great . apart major traction issues ( it terrible any type moistrue grass ) , guys loved it , it worked well . after 3-4 months , it began fail . gear box started slip . windshield cracked clean off . seat adjusters lost their screws . bunch other stuff . it very fragile toy , needs taken into account anyone purchasing this good , hearty kids like good time , but extremely rough toys . general , i am fan peg perego , so makes this even greater dissapointment . price , i would look elsewhere	-1

my son received these christmas his 1st birthday . he loves it when he matches up animals or vehicles makes them make sounds . he hasn't mastered it but more fun it . now he 2 1/2 he even more interested how it works . although word caution . when he teething he thought these blocks great scrape his gums . which would fine because they smooth but they little rubber dots contend . he managed pop off one now ambulance doesn't sound . he not swollow dot ( which easy happen ) . but these essential cause effect toys all children love . we gave our neice farm set she still plays it daily . great toy but little thing remember rubber dots ... supervise count dots	1
this sad . game ton potential ( who doesn't want play golden tee home ? ) yet sorely lacking . i can't believe golden tee people put their brand name this . hope someone company made buck off this lousy game cause they sure cheapened their name this junk . fact this game runs off batteries should warning sign . it just plain weak . complaints : graphics lousy , there only one course , putting looks/plays awful , trackball bad , whole interface slow , sound effects seem era pong . it really really bad . i don't know why they made this game . golden tee such cult following they could probably charged 100+ bucks real trackball console bit memory choice courses w/ good graphics . something replicated full-size game . i bet people would bought it , too . now nobody trust them when/if they ever . [ ... ] i don't even like video games but i excited prospect this thing . it totally let me down . i'd give it zero stars if possible	-1

quite few reviews compared zoob legos which compare apples oranges . i major lego fan since i could assemble two blocks , already purchased sets my son , but legos more building buildings , boats , man-made things general , whereas zoob much more organic allowing you create living movable things such dinosaurs , spiders , snakes , creatures all shapes , including primordial . you also build cars motorcycles , but point this toy more building singular objects rather than cities villages i used build legos . toy sturdy if handled properly . it entertaining adults children our family	1
zoob car design works other zoob pieces allow so many possibilities . loads fun , i think age recommendation right . my 4-yr-old needed little help this one first couple times . this toy take beating monster trucks fly down steps into walls without broken piece date	1
this great toy . very durable . this batmobile built last ! my son looooooves it	1
i bought this version batmobile instead rc version because it not pricey didn't require separately-purchased , expensive battery . this version great batmobile . electronic lights sounds cool , rockets hide great inside chassis , everything looks great . it great roll across floor startle any sleeping pets . only problem ? battle gear batman figure i not fit cockpit . cockpit way too small , requiring you bend jam your batman action figure limbs trying unsuccessfully force it into cockpit seat , even then it doesn't fit . i like take care my things , since i see them more collector items rather than toys . i wanted this batmobile safe place my batman figure , which normally lies out open . so unfortunately , this big disappointment . oh well , rest batmobile looks great	1

we bought this hot tub few months ago we really love it . it so easy fill just plug play . waterfull especially pretty night . ( this one only tubs its price range colorchanging water fall seats built we seen ) . our first hottub we alot research decided we not want rewire our electric case we want move it around . it made great price shell very sturdy . it take quite while heat up ( we live near chicago so it cold here ) . but once heated it retains heat well . if considering tub this price range i would definately consider this tub . we use it every day , even freezing weather right out back concrete pad . only thing we kind wish we would bought x-500 model which seats five lounger seat it , but i am sure we getting our moneys worth this	1
i am generous giving this thing star , it more like -10 stars !! far , absolute worst toy i've ever bought !! i paid $19.99 this piece garbage . within 5 hours setting it up it collapsed permanently . no bottom support it . it these silly plastic tubes you put over both door ways ( supposedly support it ) those broken less than 24 hours . wire holds up tent very flimsy bends easily so almost instantly my kids bent it out shape once thing won't stand up . four years ago we bought plastic hello kitty tent yard sale dollar friend gave us plastic house shaped frame it thing lasted years , i expecting too much this one i suppose . makes me mad since i paid retail dumb thing . don't buy this toy unless you money throw away !!! yours soon turn garbage like mine !!! absolute trash !! before purchasing this my son christmas he really into making forts , so i set up card table gave him 2 old sheets some pillows blankets inside he happy camper , thought this would add his enjoyment since it spider-man !!! i throwing spiderman out setting up card table again !! i repeat .... don't waste your hard earned dollars this one !!	-1
this toy great so far . i purchased it my 7 year old who just it christmas . i found battery pack right rack best buy $20 . 2 boys laughed played hours it . my 7 year old took his christmas money purchased nsect also tyco ( all battereies included ) he loves too . only problem now radio frequencies conflict so they cant play them same time . i should checked . i would recommend either these toys boys their age . i love watch them light up	1
first let me say this ... anyone who not know purchase or least check make sure batteries come any toy these days idiot . second ... if you half brain , you'd charge thing before you wrapped it up . way it ready go . yes ... $100 alot cash .. but we all end up paying it see look kids ' faces . however , all just stated mute point when addressing this toy . it absolute junk .. if you gotten more than hour play out it , you one few lucky ones . it takes very little pressure " fins " overpower gears while morphing . point , gears break you $100 paper weight . now ... you send it back .. amazon absolutely took care us ... but what you going get return same piece junk ... only new shiny , broken hour again . we purchased two .. one each boys . gears broke one first hour . while using it inside . amazon replaced it very quickly . i think it lasted couple hours . second shocker same electrical problem others stating . doesn't want power up . we even went trouble finding battery ... local wal-mart all places . still not work . save your money this one .. it looks like couple people lucked out theirs .. but read all reviews . majority people same problems . unfortunately , we purchased ours early ... there no reviews read all .	-1

i'm 21 year old my little pony collector recently friend work brought my attention " ponyville " mini ponies , which i initially skeptical . but oh my gosh ! i think i like them more than regular ponies ! sorry , girls !! ponies small , but sturdy you don't worry their hair getting tangled because they all moulded plastic , but fabulous attention detail ! pinkie pie balloon house such wonderful playset , if you're going buy one playset , buy this one . it more fun than sweet shop , my opinion . froggy adorable , removeable his fountain . house itself snaps shut so your little one carry it her . tiny pieces either pegs hold them place or put tiny drawer bedroom . i love how precious bathroom , even though we're left wonder ; where my little ponies answer calls nature ? there also " add ons " you buy , such triple treat ice cream thingie sunny swing . they each around $5 ! conclusion , this playset sturdy , well made , clever doesn't take up nearly much room regular mlp playset , you infinitely add things , making it more fun ( i embellished mine new mccdonalds toys other ponyville accessory sets ) . make sure you get one your little girl	1

i love my first leappad system my son so much fun using it . unfortunatly , spongebob square pants best friend adventures i purchased defective . what i first noticed pages just tad too wide fit into system . i could tell comparing it other books there extra space one side . i tried remedy this myself shaving off tiny bit make it fit into system . once it fit we tried out book i found all sensors or touchpoints way off , inch or so some cases . i called companies customer service department through conversation also found pages out order possibly missing . gentleman very nice helpful sent me replacement book . but book didn't fit ! it same problem pages out order . i emailed company asked replacement completely different title . i think 2 defective books same title enough hassle we move onto new one . this only book we trouble . all other titles fit worked just fine us . kudos their customer service department though !	-1
my son ( 5 yrs ) recieved this christmas . neighborhood girls love play it him . we also sleepovers 4 extra boys ranging age 3 yrs 7 years they all loved it . we put heavy book each side end track , like directions say , it works great . we also put pillow front/behind door keep it moving . these kids gone so far make cardboard target place it so they ' get points ' each time it comes zooooming down hits it . we get big screams when cardboard'ring fire ' used car goes thru without hitting it(this comes set ) . this elevator great invention . only thing i would change grey piece under track holds end track up . it often comes loose car jump off end straight instead jumping up . i guess we tape it until we get more track add this baby . great fun !	1

i showed my 20 mo . old daughter this wal-mart she adored it ever since . it worried me she forcefully bent back characters all time , but 2 months later they're still going strong . this piano 8 songs , one each character . each bit 10 seconds long approx . " wigglegroove " " rolling down sandhills " " music w/ murray " " where jeff ? " " vegetable soup " " all i need food " " play your guitar . murray " " calling all cows " . that more than enough entertain child age . she follow some what they're singing like " clap your hands spin around " . also it nice there two volume levels so not vex harried parents . worst thing happened toy got liitle wet underneath some piano keys won't work anymore ... she hardly pays them anyway pull guys jump recorded songs . ages 1-3 this toy fun , if your kid loves wiggles like mine .	-1

we bought this book our daughter because she loves all characters associated winnie pooh . we quickly discovered what others noted , namely , it rather slow-paced when compared my first leappad other books . songs slower , story , activities much more laid-back . so while it doesn't hold our daughter attention long normal times , we found it good slowing down pace rainy days or just before bedtime . which she not learned much this book others , slower pace seems calming effect her , which any parent four year-old attest , blessing	1

" experiments " all pretty tasty , especially kids . this toy really big hit our house .	1

" one answer " condom ... " negatives - some answers i considered way off , like " what complaint people valet service ? " all answers revolved around too expensive , or driver drove too fast , took too long . i thought answers like , " he adjusted my seat , changed radio presetting stations , moved side mirrors , stole cd ... " so , some answers unreasonable . question asked , " what appliance you might ask help moving , " number 1 answer sofa , but washer/dryer wasn't even listed . didn't make sence me . also speed round , i dissappointed when speed round came around only top rated answer each question revealed worth points . television version , more than one answer valuated points . positives - screen " how play " icon thoroughly walk you through object game , it simple point . game fast paced , completely self explanatory , very compact , would great go vacations , takes no set up time , easy learning curve , game prompts you what when . bright colorful display attractive screen game menus makes it fun play " elevator music " timing your responses . conclusion - it really fun game play if you least 5 minutes sit your family play game . it go anywhere , creative , thought provoking game everyone enjoy contributing	-1

you know , i found this game quite annoying ( there lot singing each players turn)- but my 5 year old son loves it . there no dice , no spinner ( so none those pieces lose :) , but it tells you how many spaces move . so , one player easy question may get move 8 spaces , while player hard question only gets move 3 spaces . i guess that plus because you can't cheat ( it even tells you which color you land ) , but process , it makes game rather simple . my son would rather play himself so he doesn't lose . questions not challenging my son ( he just turned 5 may ) , so i guess it gives him since " hey ! i'm smart , i know all this stuff "	-1

i can't think better toy . there gazillion ways use this toy , pre-walking through kindergarten . it set blocks , bead maze , walker , pretend lawn mower , pretend shopping cart , pretend car , pretend doll stroller , step-stool , storage chest .... it wheels lids , which best inventions earth far our 15-mo concerned . if you hardwood floors , i recommend quick fix slow cart down pre-walkers ... our hardwood floors , this walker rolled too fast our pre-walker control . so , i super-glued foam-rubber kidkushions ** onto corners back edge . kidkushions ( sold babyproofing supplies ) drag floor just enough slow cart down . [ ... ] now our guy walking pretty well , he still loves this toy . i recently used some bicycle-chain lubricant wheels so they would stop squeaking so much . however , i'm not sure i'd recommend doing if you still pre-walker . wheel friction also helped slow cart down bit	1

i bought this my daughter fourth birthday because i remembered similar big red blocks my own kindergarten years . it her favorite present . she built towers , beds her stuffed animals , hurdles , set up restaurant table chairs her dolls , more . it classic toy , great creative play . i wish it more big red blocks ; vast majority small yellow ones . you assemble blocks , which not too difficult if you two people it . it really takes more than two hands	1
we bought this our 3 1/2 year old daughter store assortment barbie items we inherited . divided lid great tiny objects like shoes , perfume bottles etc . stays closed surprisingly well even while it slammed open shut reach items inside case . case stores barbies upright which keeps hair getting tangled etc . clear case great seeing what inside wheels handle convenient our daughter . we weren't sure what expect far quality , but plastic case money we paid , we think it great buy	1

i played yahtzee kid my dad forgotten how much fun it . while looking some non-electronic games play my kids , i stumbled across yahtzee instantly remembered good times . introducing game family tonight , i hoping they would enjoy it much i years ago . they not dissapoint me after playing several games they all complimented me choice . reviewer called yahtzee " quietly educational " , i completely agree term . my oldest , who since his school started letting him use calculator algebra geometry lost ability math his head , suddenly rediscovered his math skills when his score line . only thing milton bradley wrong this game cheap size pad score sheets they include . other than , this classic game not lost anything over years . turn off television or computer play this game people you love .	1

honestly , i not familiar sudoku before purchasing this game . i heard it knew it new " craze " but i never played it . buying christmas presents i picked up several these decided keep one myself . i find it completely enjoyable . i not use dry erase pen yet but i appreciate it there case i need mark screen . i not any trouble viewing screen - it not light up i know some this one things i considered when buying this particular game , but i find i see it just fine . buttons easy use . after playing it several times , i am not sure i would even like model touch screen instead stylus instead . this fun highly addictive . it great item when you waiting anything - nice little time waster actually uses your brain cells but not so difficult take away entertainment ( there several levels choose so you select level you comfortable - admittedly , i only ventured second level this point ) . anyway , nice priced diversion . i recommend it whole heartedly	1
this thing awsome . though i wish it litlle clearer directions	-1
i bought these my 5 year old son who huge car fan . he using matchbox cars pretending they lightening mcqueen friends , but when he recieved set these he so excited . these cars larger than matchbox cars , heavy their size , good quality !! great car fan your life	1
legos great they always , there endless things them they fit together perfectly ! fact legos not made china ( some sets 1 or 2 small parts but bulk their goods made elsewhere ) gives them extra points this family :-) only reason these not earn 5 star rating description amazon gave described set containing " gold " ( color ) bricks which set we received not contain	-1
i initially bought this set my three-year-old but thought better it since he almost 4 . so , i bought him regular set legos going take these back . however , after much frustration smaller legos , i.e. not able get them apart very easily , etc ., i brought these out well , it true love ever since . i really recommend these younger set - i bought smaller ones because i didn't think he'd get much good out these since they indicate they're only age 5 . don't pay any attention age these . they expand older kids use these since they smaller ones say age three , i wouldn't pay attention either . grab bigger ones ages 2-6 or so , they able use them fun well	1
this best toy we ever bought our 3 year old . he plays non-stop this both outdoors our basement . i worried it might go through alot batteries but hasnt case . he learned hit so well i'm little scared he won't find t-ball very stimulating . adults alot fun this too ! if we paid 4 times what it cost i would still say it worth every penny ! this one wont get left behind huge pile unused toys . definitely great toy thats easy pocketbook	1
these durable , well-constructed wooden puzzles big hit 18 months + crowd . i believe my son love trucks started this educational puzzle . pieces easy little hands grasp attached pegs , puzzle easy yet developmentally sound toddlers definitely worth money . yourself favor though -- get puzzle holder if you plan purchasing few these types puzzles ..	1
we pretty much all potc toys made ! megabloks black pearl pirate ship lot detail lot pieces . we two these they each took 20 minutes build . ships fragile so if your child likes play rough they come apart . my 7yo 4yo boys love them anyway . they rich detail my kids into their imaginary play hours them . we also zizzle black pearl pirate ship . it doesn't nearly many parts ( not " lego " style like megabloks ) bigger . it some cool electronic noises trap doors , but not detailed megabloks version . megabloks version real sails too . zizzle ship no action figures , so you order 3 " figures separately ( my kids just use their megabloks figures ) . their other favorites megabloks flying dutchman ( built lot like black pearl ) dead man chest . these sets must potc fan	-1
my daughter got this read me system her 3rd birthday . she madly love george dvd . there fun games addition very cute story . if you this system , your kid love this story	1

great starter set . however , 2 year old i would recommend buying second train without batteries - it help them play set better . overall great buy	1
every year parents grandparents search ultimate toy - one kids love spend hours playing while others piled up under tree still their boxes .... well , this toy ! first all , it easy assemble while two 3 1/2 year old waited impatiently . they both mesmerized quickly began piecing tracks together help . it quickly assembled into figure eight shown box , no instructions needed . two little ones spent hours playing .... no derailments either . these cars stay their track even when pieces aren't perfectly aligned . this equal opportunity toy i loved seeing my 3 1/2 year old daughter play something wasn't doll related change . she her two year old boy cousin each separate set , which some bigger " boys " turned into one bigger track , but each their own set two cars - so fighting minimal . if purchasing multiple children share i would recommend adding additional engine cars passenger cars eliminate competition control . there enough room multiple cars different intervals track simultaneously .	1
my 3 year old received this toy christmas . she enjoys putting puzzles together very much . however , she trouble getting them apart - wooden pieces not come apart very easily . we already 4 or 5 pieces broken - layer wood come off , either off picture part or back piece . i disappointed when piece broke after we only puzzles few days ! wood very thin . shapes back great sorting pieces , but compartments hold pieces aren't big enough . if pieces don't go " just so " - lid won't close . puzzles nice , but i would not purchase this toy again due quality	-1

we got this my son 2nd birthday ( since he loves his duplo blocks ) he really loves thomas train track now 2 1/2 put it together himself , i just wish i could get more track , especially straight track pieces make this set bigger more interesting than simple oval or bean shape ( all pieces curved this set . ) percy/toby/james sets cute but only come few pieces track , i might buy one anyway since whenever he little friend over they fight over train so it would good 2 trains . my only compaint it hard my son keep trains track , wheels lined up exactly groves track , i often push it around him no problem , but he gets so excited he usually runs it off track before even getting half way around , hopefully he outgrow this ! i would recommend this older toddlers preschooler , it very durable . if anyone knows where get more track please let me know :	-1

my 6 year old got this guitar three kings day ( precisely today , january 6 ) . my opinion songs only appropiate girls age 6 up , since it 2 cartridges 6 popular rock-pop songs you find comercials kids bop songs cartoon network . volume control great , so way you don't get headaches loud constant play , but headset kind confusing . i posted some images my daughter ( brunette one ) showing " i guess " correct way wear headphones . overall , i like this guitar anyways . hope this help other moms .	-1

whew ! i just put this thing together i say it coolest . it took me probably hour ( only because i am not good nautical knots ) i am really impressed quality this toy . detail incredible . price very affordable , especially considering quality this ship . i looking muti-purpose " pirate ship " bought this particular ship because playmobil name , great price , fact it floats well rolls around wheels . it really hard find bath toys five year old . i can't give you feedback far my son ( soon five ) conserned because it bithday gift ( now how i wrap this ?? ) . but honestly if he dosent like it ; i am apt keep it myself ! i plan buy maybe castle or vacation home next . i just hope he lets me play them once awhile !!!! tip : most playmobil sets , give yourself hour or two assemble them if you would like your child able play them soon they get them . p.s. this toy come 5 hand guns . since this concern mine , putting it together before giving it him i opportunity toss these before he gets his hands them . plus , i tell him swords knifes come it cutting up fish fruit keep away scurrvey . oh yeah , course all treasure stolen pirates distributed poor !	1
response : they ( bratz ) teech kids act like some gangster goes around kills people ! babys wear chains , goodness sake !!!!!!! " reply : last time i checked , bratz dolls . nothing else . parents , listen me . if your parenting skills so dismal your kids acts like doll , then you need counseling , not ban bratz dolls . kid , i played working woman barbie , if you knew me , you'd know i'm farthest thing coffee-chugging , business-suit-wearing blonde who goes dates ken thinks " going work fun . " like most people , i developped continue develop based influences around me my own personality , not some doll . true , dolls might present some little girls ' dreams . they used marketing ploy well . but most part , bratz won't turn your kids into short-skirt-wearing , hair-obsessed lolitas . one way or , your kid discover mtv all destined give parents headaches . how your kids turn out up you them . dolls used fantasies , if you try limit your kid fantasy , then you're creating " forbidden fruit " , which actually encourages rules broken ! if your kid wants bratz , buy them bratz . if want barbie , get ' em barbie . both end up naked bathroom floor . you should worried if your precious princess wants play undress boys , not dolls . finally , bratz not gangsters . all you know , they might representations nice girls who just happen like fashion . whatever happened don't judge book its cover , hm ? erm , all . chow ! don't touch sushi . xoxoxo , roxann	1

truth , raider tower really brings nothing new megabloks dragons line ( other than new faction , iron raiders ) . all figures dragons repaints , no new pieces included , far i see . said , it still way better than newest line , metal ages , whose constructions pieces mostly useless making your own creations , whose figures come much smaller amounts per kit ( largest comes only 6 , much less than older kits like dragair castle ) . older kits like iron raiders simpler , yet they come many more pieces , more figures , whole lot more playability , you see my review . first all , kit comes large metal tin , perfect transporting pieces elsewhere . when i opened tin , i surprised find many more plastic bags than i expected find . opening all them took few minutes , but i soon all pieces layed out , started build . i expected ( i've other unenjoyable builds megabloks kits ) construction process not nearly fun standard lego kit . it often took lot effort snap pieces together , once , i even take down part assembly fix mistake , due sometimes unclear instructions . still , tower came together without too much hassle , everything else kit . once completed , though , tower something gaze . construction detail pieces excellent , tower whole really good looking . i especially like bridge leads tower little details like torches dragons heads . interior whole different story , however , it virtually non existent . this came downer me , i hoped something more than just ladder trapdoor . good thing megabloks compatible legos , so you easily create your own interior ! ( i added table food chairs , throne , some weapons racks . ) dragons , course , included , since this fairly large kit . red dragon named ignistrafe monster named grovel found this kit , both which need assembly . pieces , once again , often hard snap , but once together , don't break off very easily . dragon very detailed , painted over 6 different colors , monster . they both great display , since they both features ( dragons wings flap his claw pick up minifigures , monster jaws snap shut when opened ) , they great playing well . minifigures also well detailed , although they fewer colors than dragons . kit comes 10 , 6 iron raiders 4 draigar warriors , enough good battle this kit alone . they , however , simply repaints dragair , norvagen , vorgan minifigures , all which came previous series , krystal wars . their fingers also fairly fragile , 2 my figures only hold weapons or shields one their hands now . one other thing : while iron raiders came apart easily , draigar warriors seem glued together , although their joints still move . other things included catapult , harpoon launcher some sort , 2 horses , large selection weapons shields . weapons come all sort shapes , clubs , swords , axes make up most them . now , one most important parts kit pieces , this kit aces area ! pieces include basic corner triangle castle walls , rocks rock walls , ladders , dragons heads , torches , 2 stone arches , stairs , few basic bricks , lots baseplates , flag pole . everything needed make castle , bridge , or some other medieval structure here , making kit great parts building pack . there also crystal , which , when inserted into holder , lights up flashes . effect neat , you also plug it into red dragon saddle same thing happen . last thing i judging this kit playability , even here , kit well . you great battles all things included , young kids love features like catapult trap door . since kit figures also disassembled , you simulate battle damage you play , knocking off walls or torches while playing . overall , i think kit definitely worth it . i would not recommend it someone under 6 , due difficulty construction , but anyone over age who loves legos megabloks love this kit . even someone who new building sets appreciate large amount figures playability , although i still would recommend lego set over this . i leave you this final thought : i used consider megabloks poor quality , but after buying this kit , i changed my mind .	-1

my son 5 years old big fan pirates toys . when i saw box i extremely impressed display . box advised toy kids 6 older . ship " lego " type structure requiring some assembly . i prior experience assembling lego models i felt i up task . what i learn this definitely isn't same quality lego product pieces would not lock together . upon assembling main structure , pieces would snap out place out warning . after 20 minutes stress trying keep structure intact during assembly process , i decided it time take break . returned 20 minutes later , portion structure i able lock pieces together again started fall-apart . i proceeded shove pieces back box rush it back department store refund . maybe i patience 6 year old , but i can't see my 5 year old enjoying playing toy which collapses when moved . pros : box packaging impressive . look feel pieces very detailedconsinstructions could clearer . although lego concept isn't difficult , lot trial error required . quality control not what i'm used . son never chance play this item it never assembled . i replaced it playmobil pirate ship my son really enjoyed playing this product	-1

humpty dumpty sat wall . humpty dumpty great fall . all king horses all king men couldn't put humpty together again . although humpty dumpy anthropomorphized egg who appeared well-known mother goose rhyme , he also pops up lewis carroll " through looking-glass , " where he most interesting discussion alice regarding semantics . his origin there theories humpty dumpty ( ) powerful cannon mounted atop church colchester defended city against siege 1648 during english civil war , ( ) reference king richard iii , supposedly hunchbacked monarch who fell off horse named wall battle bosworth field , ( ) roman war machine called testudo used cross moats climb over castle walls , ( ) medieval slang short , clumsy person ( idea explanation story humpty dumpty egg , which , you note , not mentioned rhyme ) . none those explanations suffice when it comes mcfarlane toy " twisted fairy tales " version humpty dumpty , who just suffered aforementioned great fall . if you thought cracked shell bad thing , wait until you get gander maggot-infested insides this humpty dumpty . this figure not breakfast , sure , but idea bit better than execution . again , you really want insides humpty dumpty so gross you would swear you smell rotten egg ? i think not , which why i consider this least compelling figure twisted fairy tales collection . this hit or miss figure far i am concerned . twisted fairy tales fourth series mcfarlane monsters , rest menagerie consists red riding hood , peter peter pumpkin eater , little miss muffet , tag team hansel gretel ( who sold separately not set , just clear here ) . once you look humpty dumpty you know these sick , twisted figures , intended only mature audiences . because if you old enough know english civil war , richard iii , roman war machines , medieval slang , then you know most nursery rhymes originate such fun things black death . you youngsters probably just thought mother goose twisted sense humor , mcfarlane toys certainly confirmed your suspicions these figures	-1

after reviewing several ball pits , we chose sesame street ball pit our 19 month old ; mainly because it elmo , decent size ( although it rather large once it set up ) , under $40 shipping . my son loves ball pit . he jumps through back doorway side opening . he plays basketball hoop push-through hole , buries himself balls . there not slide which listed amazon description . although we lot fun pit , there some drawbacks . namely : it comes only 75 balls ( 200-300 more fills it nicely ) , it constructed cheaper plastic , blow-up rails bend down so our son jump or out where he not supposed ( he loves it ... i correct him ) . overall , it lot fun if you room . it fit 2 children comfortably , up 4 squeeze	-1
i give this ball pit 4 stars because my niece loves it ! however , i would agree it looks bigger than it after you get it blown up - you need more balls ! i bought this my 13 month old niece - she absolutly loves it - however after only 2 months it - it starting rip seams some areas - this could due fact she doesnt care use door it - she just climbs over edges . however , i gave it 4 stars because it one her favorite places play - its like her little playhouse ! also great buy since i amazon prime didnt pay shipping !!	-1

my 5yr old son loves this toy , he always loved build things . but most educational toys 5-6yr old needs some guidance . this isn't kind toy you just plop your kid down front walk away ( see " playdoh " ) , they'll just end up hating it . you need take time show them how it works , what they it , pretty soon they'll get hang it , bonus you get spend quality time your kid . everyone talks quality time vs . quantity time use it excuse spend less time their kids . simple truth you cannot spend quality time without spending significant quantity time !!	1

we bought this our son when he 13 months . he loved pushing buttons ( numbers ) colored animals get toy talk him . he learned his numbers this toy ! he now 18 months , reliably pick any number toy asks or i ask . he also knows animals colors them . toy 3 or 4 different settings ask different things , such " find number 5 ... " or " which animal says " moo " ? " , or " find orange cat " . it respond animal sound , voice saying " this orange cat " . our son gets them all every time ! we haven't used spanish setting , though our son loves flip it , then he no idea what voice saying , but he keeps doing it anyway ! great toy , well worth money	1
i bought this my one year old granddaughter christmas . it little too old her . she press buttons but could not play games . now she 18 months she press buttons more knows names animals . this great toy sit child interact . it durable so far not needed new batteries after 4 months . i would consider this toy 2 year old	-1
you tell reviews , this game awesome . my girlfriend i love play it together , it works very well two players . lots great strategy games work well 4-6 players , but carcassonne manages great only two well	1

my daughter received this birthday gift thrilled when she saw box . however , after taking pieces out putting them together , putting them together , then putting them together again , she lost all interest it . she loves 2 cats movie most excited they included . wedding arch falls apart if you look it wrong . i would not spend my money this unless you intend sit there your child reconstruct thing every time she moves .	-1
i am satisfied product . kids enjoy it . only thing i noticed picture web box , show part shoots ball down lane made partially metal . i guess changed ball shooter all blue plastic now . it works fine though , so it not really issue . i'd recommend rack roll bowl	-1
much needed our rc car . we purchased rc car unable find battery pack store . result we purchase normal aa while we searched out battery pack . after 2 days replace batteries 3 times we told our son wait till this came . it great once it got car . like others said car worked much better . it faster , more powerful , lot more fun my husband son . it lasted hour then just died when it lost power . excellent product .	1

my son loved his r.c dirtbike . it rides really well esp . dirt asphalt but broke first day he played it . sad him	-1
first all , it not toy , it hobby plane i agree people who say it not 10 year olds . every one who wrote bad review either too impatient fly it didn't read instructions which say it pro level plane fly it , you need read instructions or you'l regret it or they're just not good pilots . my experience storm launcher excelent . you need drive it ground first 8- 10 times so motors get used it . then , before flying , you need some small jumps practice . before you know it , you fly it almost 6 minutes loops .	1
products made almost entirely flimsy styrofoam . pieces break every time it used . plenty glue packing tape available keep it together . you need buy separate battery charger $30.00 - which doesn't last all long . all all - its $100.00 tissue - you blow it once its trash .	-1
i just recieved this game yesterday i love it . first time i played it i won million dollars , bad it wasn't real . thing i like this game unlike some other hand held ones i played you turn it off , it little blue button top turns it off . it save your game too if you turn it off some reason , which me great cause i 4 little kids don't always let me sit very long . i got electronic game too but haven't played it yet , i like watch show but i love play game , i got tired playing it website so i purchused this see if it funner it .	1
i can't praise this product without stepping toes 40 other reviews ! i'll just say my 5 year old daughter big dinosaur buff she knows her stuff . she nature videos , books , everything ! she thinks this set a-okay . she loves setting up " dinosaur land " bright colored mat comes , too . my 2 year old son , who not " paleontologist " my daughter also loves playing these cool dinosaurs .	1

well worth extra money this game format . purchased closable travelling soap dish cards , better ziploc� bags chips - throw everything into tube . read some comments flexible board curling gave some hesitation going this route . this solved rolling board printing outside , so when board unrolled natural temporary edge curl downwards . only possible negative tube not handy travelling or storag	1
friend bought this table my daughter when she 18 mo old . she now 3 i 8 1/2 mo old we throwing this table trash . first all , cookie monster part not work - it never . secondly , odd times e.g. 3 o'clock morning , it start making it noises singing songs no reason . finally , most importantly , it falls over whenever my son leans it . we going give it away because it kind annoying but because it also dangerous we now just throw it trash . not buy this toy	-1

this too difficult my 5-year old work . initially i couldn't get it work ... it took 20 minutes rubbing get it lick . now i get it work much faster ( 5 minutes ... still pretty long child ) rubbing extrememly hard fast . first tongue not wet , but eventually after getting it work several times , it become wet ( guess it takes while water work its way into tongue ? ) . don't waste your money or disappoint your child	-1
this good toy keeping your brothers sisters out your room all times so get this if you don't want anybody going taking anything out your room !!!!!!!!!	1
i high hopes this game , but unfortunately , this product average best . use dvd slow game questions limited how many times you land wedge before it stops giving questions tells you just ask deck . also questions lame , what faze moon it when golum climbed down cliff eming mul ' ( sp ? ) , what color someone dress particular scene , how many days gimili , aragon , legolas track hobbits ? who cares , questions movie making even worse , really .	-1
we bought this trike our daughter first birthday . she loves it ! she little small reach pedals but she loves hang onto handle bar swing her legs . only issue i trike there no seatbelt . if you getting it older child , it doesn't matter but we made seatbelt camera strap help hold smaller kids seat	-1
my son received this trike christmas present his grandparents . he only 14 months old , but big his age , any case he cannot pedal yet . best features trike it easy mom or dad steer , it seat strap , its just plain cooler than going walk stroller . my son loves it anytime he gets peek it he points it squeals , if we don't let him ride it he gets upset . he feels like big boy , especially since he always sees older kids our neighborhood their bikes . features you live without include sun shade , which i haven't noticed actually blocking any sun , cup holder which doesn't really work out well , slightest turn drink tips spills . this only detracts slightly overall impression trike , but you could save some money buying model without useless sunshade . seat doesn't seem adequate five year old , which age trike supposed used until . i don't think we'll use it much past three years , but all all it sturdy little trike my son loves it	1

this one games my friends i played death . it very fun simple , yet some mathematical skills probabilities doesn't hurt . purpose game fill your score sheet much possible making different combinations required . more you higher score , multiple yahtzee ( five kind ) scores you bonuses . there different editions this game but this one best . here why : redesigned : this edition yahtzee comes felt-lined cup tray . remember how loud it use plastic cup original edition ? well now it very quiet tray keeps dice going everywhere . dice over size which nice touch . it also dice keeper where you place dice you not re-roll . playing materials : folio comes score pad engraved pencil . but it also room store more pencils pads . you even store triple yahtzee pad if you any . triple yahtzee kind yahtzee advanced isn't sold anymore although you still find scoring pads instructions net ( which all you need ) . portable : you drag this game anywhere . since you play solo it great take your doctor appointment . if you don't mind people asking where you got cool yahtzee game . it perfect travel zippered case very nice durable . overall game great this folio edition must buy any yahtzee fan . way i saw someone once roll three yahtzees row finish ten yahtzees six round game . i know you better ... if you try . fun !	1
i loved clue growing up , so when my mother asked me gift ideas my 8-year-old son , i suggested clue jr. among other board games geared his age , he received clue jr. christmas present thrilled . ( he likes mysteries just like his mom ! ) unfortunately , our glee short-lived . my brother girlfriend , her 12-year-old son , my son , i sat down play this game . my brother girlfriend read instructions , we tried figure out what color coded stickers -- how even begin play . now , let me just say both us board game aficionados who played zillions games clue our day . i genius iq she pediatric nurse . short , we ain't stupid . yet , even mid-game , we hard time figuring out how move game pieces , how discover clues mark off checklist , so . you see , each player not specific game piece regular clue . instead , you peel off small stickers place under white bases ( green " crumb " label indicating culprit five time labels ) yellow drink labels five yellow bases . then , you roll color-coded die determine if you should look under yellow furniture pawn , under white character pawn , or move any character forward up number rolled dice . if character lands yellow space , look bottom furniture piece that room ( example , plant patio ) . then , secretly look under furniture pawn that next room . even now , i'm re-reading instructions , i'm hard time understanding what ! ( so it doesn't make easy reviewing , let alone playing ! ) not only , there not lot room game board putting furniture pieces beside room ... let alone it ! we so frustrated bored all four us agreed quit -- play pictionary jr. , instead . if you're feeling nostalgic tempted buy clue jr. child , resist urge . you'll wasting your money time my opinion . ( we're returning game this weekend , fact . ) pieces chintzy , game play confusing , it doesn't even come pencils	-1
my 2 sons 3 1/2 5 years old they both absolutely love this game . we play it everyday . they never seem get bored it .	1

this excellent game but it much better cities knights expansion . i haven't tried seafarers expansion yet , but i would imagine would add dimension added fun level . ( although manual note only certain scenarios seafarers added cities knights due fact it would too hard protect against barbarian attacks fully explore sea)the neat thing this game island different every time due island tiles shuffled upside down before they turned over placed . players start game placing settlements roads near resource tiles . tiles covered randomly drawn numbers people receive resources based whether number their resource tile rolled dice . goal game attain 10 pts before anyone else building more roads , cities or armies ( this harder than it sounds ) . fighting each other really not element this game . army built drawing " soldier " cards more these cards than other people . biggest component this game bartering . some people more one kind resource than others , everyone needs cooperative some level bargaining order build . key not helping your opponent too much while not making enemy . my niece who 7 years old able pick up rules catan right away . knights expansion probably take her little longer but i see no problems her able play her own eventually . if i remember correctly , i think box says game takes 2 hours . it takes my family more like 3-4 hours play game . learning rules knights expansion turned game into 8 hour game , but i am sure now we know rules it go down back 3-4 hour game . biggest downside this game how critical it beginning choose where place your settlements . depending what numbers rolled most next resources determine who gets most resources . this lean advantage more towards certain players . there also things called development cards which purchased resources which add component game . they used steal resources other players , build roads without spending resources , etc . game pieces made wood , island tiles made sturdy cardboard . this enjoyable game , but far simpler than i expected , i enjoyed added dimensions knights expansion because it added barbarian attacks against island ability purchase knights protect island . knights also chase robber away block others roads . there also more interesting cards drawn ( progress cards ) add more action game . it seems easier get more resource cards . overall , there just seems lot more ways win game much more action each hand . there lot rules expansion it little challenging first remember all them , but regardless , i would still buy knights expansion right away this game . expansion i would rate this over 5 stars .	-1
my kids their friends love playing this game . it game strategy	1
really 0 ( zero ) stars but not option . this game awful dvd player but found if you could keep it freezing up x-box , it moved little quicker ... until it froze . what wrong it ? i don't think i read one good review wished i investigated before buying second one after thinking maybe i just got bad one first time . why everyone buy two ?	-1
past 4 months , we played this twice . it poor graphics slow response time . i really didn't expect whole lot price , but pictures grainy hardly recognizable . it isn't exciting my daughter learns more watching show . i am disappointed since i really hoped little better this kind game .	1
i bought this item my 3 year old daughter she loves it . her room one her less favorite places house , until this game arrived . it so many different cool adventures she can't seem put it down , it keeps her entertained hours . this game includes : dig dig dig .. tunnel through dirt stones reach bottom before swiper fox . steer clear reaaly big rocks ! river river race adventure .. how quickly you race swiper fox down river ? saltador , jumping star help you jump over frogs , crocodiles whirlpools . rainbow balloon race ... sail across sky rescuing stars butterflies swipers bubble machine . avoid grumpy rain clouds way ! puzzle bridge repair ... oh , no ! swiper fox remove pieces bridge mix them up . you help return each piece ?. cool thing this game up 4 players play help solve puzzles , win races stop swiper fox . this game early childhood intended children 5 older . my 3 year old her 10 9 year old sisters her side help her way . this game definately worth it i would highly recommend all who thinking purchasing one . this definately going one most requested christmas so dont wait till it sold out buy now	1
other than larger than i would liked , this toy fantastic . my 2.5 year old obsessed pushing buttons . remotes , cell phones , you name it . we've trying teach him alphabet since he year old , limited success . child doesn't doesn't attention span anything we've tried ( flash cards , drawing , associating words , etc ) . he'd watch dvds like leap frog letter factory , but there still no visable improvement . we picked up little kiddie laptop during our time here holland , but it only speaks dutch . we realized while nothing we helping , he getting very good dutch version alphabet ( same letters , different sounds most ) engrossed this laptop . my husband i talked it nostalgia brought up old speak ' spells we children 80s . we soon found out they discontinued , so i came amazon hunt something similar found this produc t.t wo weeks ownership later my son now very good not only recognizing alphabet , but also words it teaches basic shapes . i actually heard machine praising over over again last night went searching my son my husband , who i certain helping him . imagine my surprise when my son sitting alone doing it all himself . i so terribly proud impressed . we've put piece tape over speaker , note , because it terribly loud no volume control , but it small price pay how much it taught my child so little time	1

we large group friends gets together regular basis our usual game choice 80 or 90 game ! we play ' guys against girls ' , usually we make guys answer 80 questions girls answer 90 questions . ( i think 80 questions little harder just because you think back whole decade ! )if you lucky roller you really get ahead game using " free jump " . also , if guys land sports questions too much they usually end up beating girls . best part these games questions aren't too serious or too impossible like trivial pursuit . if you lived 80 or 90 , you should know answers - hard ( but fun ) part just trying remember ! ladies , you remember song joey mcintyre ( former nkotb ) came out solo 1999 ? i recommend buying both games - its fun intermix questions ! fun , fun , fun	1
if you're like my friends me spent your teens early 20 90 , you'll love this game . great questions dealing music , movies , tv , events , sports . great thing most questions really make you think bit ( it not super-easy no-brainer like some other games out there ) . we set up 3 teams 2 game took hour , hour half ( obviously , more teams = longer playing time ) . this game definitely staple all our gaming nights . sure bet	-1
after torrential rains june , i bought 90 game this summer rainy day activity my beach house . but we didn't just play 90 game rainy afternoons , my housemates itching play this game when they woke up , beach before going out night . 90 game fun game groups -- never dull moment , even if you didn't watch every re-run 90210 melrose place ! everyone dominate least some categories -- whether you music buff , sports fiend , movie aficionado or tv nut -- but it never too easy win , nor too difficult cause boredom	1
my father made me some wooden dolls furnature when i younger . i wanted pass it down my daughter ( now 4 ) but needed house few new pieces furnature . my daughter loves house , its perfect size preschooler ( more complex house may come bit later ) . rooms open its easy make it however she wants ( we actually attatched garage it , but she uses it bathroom or bedroom ) . its very bright beautiful , most pieces large sturdy enough 4 year old handle ( some smallest most complex little things i couldnt even handle ) . there arent any stairs ( really bothers her , we still studying it see if few adjustments could made :) . i love house sturdy alows fun play ( even my 10 month old twins " play " it)the people ridiculously cheap . they felt soon fall apart . my daughter makes them " nextdoor neighbors " ( which usually ends up annoying or bad guy family ) . most other sets wont fit ( ie loving family little people dont fit well , although we old hand-me-down plastic house downstairs . furnature held up surprizingly well , but we many other pieces my old house , so they dont get much " action " . they also really hurt if you step them , but goes most any house ... all all i love house , hate people , think furnature mediocor quality ... pretty good buy , but maybe not ideal choice child over age 5-6	-1

pretty expensive but i ended up splurging getting it my 8 year old nephew this coming christmas . i ended up giving it him this weekend instead ; i wanted see it go too couldn't wait 4 months ! my nephew really likes it but , oy !, video bad -- what they show online commercial quite bit clearer contrasty than what we see our actual unit . i think infrared aspect blurs things bit its sensitivity pretty low any case . you can't read any writing thru video , regardless size print , etc . still , video link minimally serviceable ( adequate manuevering little bit practice ) my nephew big time sitting his " command center " sending it out " remote missions " using only onboard video link . seems fairly robust sturdy so far	-1
we bought this our daughter right after she began crawl . she absolutely loved it . several key points : 1)she truly enjoyed feedback she would get when she would make basket . especially if others room cheered game . then she would really start hammin ' it up ! great self esteem ! 2)the baseball component her least favorite first but once she got hang it i noticed her concentration unbelievable ! she determined hit ball if it last thing she would . excellent hand-eye coordination . 3)the football wasn't most interactive part game , especially our daughter aged , but when she younger sound motion certainly stimulating her developing mind but no way overwhelming her . 4)yes whole set small but if consumers read box they see it not meant taller more mobile children not height adjustable . little tikes other products meet those needs . this great toy crawlers , those pull themselves up standing , early walkers . we would buy this again heartbeat far our daughter favorite toy her transition infancy toddlerhood . we planning getting adjustable hoop christmas hope she enjoys it much !	1
my son recieved this gift 6 months . even though it rated 9 months up , he enjoyed it still enjoys it . here what we like it : 1 . he likes spinning football unassisted , even while sitting . i spun it him once he " got " it right away . it something he sitting without help . 2 . he likes sounds/music when you put ball through hoop , even though he couldn't it seated , he loved it when we'd hold him up let him dunk ball . 3 . he loves bat , though he not able connect bat ball just yet , he likes banging floor bat . 4 . even tough he can't hit baseball bat , he likes pushing ball hearing clicking noise . 5 . it definitely helped hand-eye coordination he learned drop ball into hoop or put it hole . it also some cause effect , because now he drops ball knows where look it . 4 . unlike roll-a-rounds toys , which we generally like , basketballs just right size him pick up one hand . here what not great : 1 . it fairly large , but not heavy/stable enough him pull himself up or rely standing ( now he ) . he almost pulled it over several times trying this . 2 . it really hard put together , even though there no screws , etc . it basically " snapped " together , but me , my husband his best friend all fight get pieces place . 3 . sometimes basketball doesn't push lever all way register basket . while my son can't count doesn't know score hasn't updated , he likes sound , so i end up hitting it my hand , which he now started copy . overall i give this 4 stars . he enjoying it almost 3 months now , i anticipate it continue one his favorite toys	-1

ok , i'm waaayyyy too old writing pogo sticks . but i'm hooked , so here goes ... if you going spend big bucks pogo stick , then you should take good look what available . yes , this one cool it very good . but dig deeper before buying . this particular pogo stick designed vurtego/etoy ** cheaper ** version their top-of-the-line sticks ( pro series , " ultra " series ) . if you like this specific design you plan drop significant dinero stick , why not get one versions higher quality components ? , since company makes stick 2 sizes , why not track down one provides best fit your needs ? design this stick bit unusual . it doesn't use spring like time-honored sticks , it doesn't use sling-shot surgical tubing like flybar sticks . it uses large air cylinder , which you inflate you would bicycle tire or bouncing ball ( using air compressor or bike pump ) . so feel not necessarily what you'd expect . this not bad thing , but it definitely doesn't feel springy like old sticks . it really more like brisk bounce , like super ball . when you switch jumpers ( e.g. , if you skinny your friends weigh ton ) , it drag make adjustments . then again , it wasn't really possible make adjustments old sticks . i strongly recommend xpogo extreme pogo website source information . they up-to-date reviews all pogo sticks market , members ' comments each sticks . if you thinking buying stick , consider one flybar products ( 1200 , soon-to-be released 800 ) , motostik , or one other vurtego products .	-1

we bought this toy our nine year son . i say , we expected whole lot more . while frog internal organs interesting , reasonably true life , there no schmatic diagram any kind . so , once child " dissected " frog removed organs , it matter guesswork how they go back . more like just fitting them best you rather than really understanding how various pices/organs fit back into frog . it would far more useful if there schematic diagram which child could follow reassemble internal organs . such this turned out " play it once " then put it shelf item . too bad it great idea . just needs bit more terms directives	-1

this item highly requested item both my children use their ' regular ' pixters . my children very excited get one , because ' now ' they could play their pixters car during night travels/trips ( or any time it difficult see screen , which pretty much most time ! ) . well , long story short , you not use light ' regular/original ' pixters ! it not state anywhere package exactly what pixters they compatable . it only says it not used all pixters , statement not very visible ! light needs able plug into top pixter game unit ' regular/orginal ' units not made this . my kids extremely disappointed , i	-1
this 500-in-1 kit more features than average attention span handle ( i won't re-hash list here . you find complete list projects online somewhere ) . so , this not " well , this looks like good gift johnny " product . whoever going receive ( if it gift ) or purchase themselves , should fairly serious learning electronics . if not , start much smaller kit , work yourself up this one . far construction , it pretty sturdy . breadboard centrally located layout perspective , i no trouble setting up any experiments . ****** note ******* there ton resistors , wires , caps , etc . i ended up buying couple plastic partitioned containers hold everything still wasn't enough . pretty much everything comes individually marked plastic bag , tesla help you if you don't take care replacing everything back into correct baggie , or you'll quickly memorize resistor identification chart ... though , may not bad side-effect :) ********************* i some trouble breadboard itself , some slots really tough punch into my big sausage-like fingers , i ended up bending few leads wire ends here there settled using some needle nose pliers feed tough slots . experiments split up into 3 large softbound manuals ( aprox 10 " x14 " ) cover very wide range projects . there " you know " type blurbs throughout which makes them informative . ****** note ******* my biggest problem this kit text experiments . i found myself wanting more " this what happening why " type information , but what you get mostly just how set up project . imho , it missing 1 or 2 more paragraphs talking why project . ********************** ironically , most use i actually got out this kit , prototype test some circuts devices ( motors , lights , solenoids , etc ) using breadboard variable resistor pots , but i've since purchased breadboard r.s. some basic wires/resistors/caps/etc allow me all . my add only allowed me trek through first manual before i saw shiny object left this kit gather dust closet . if you serious using kit learn electronics , then this probably you . if you looking it hobby view , i'd recommend starting something smaller . ( sorry long review , but since no one else submited one , i figured i'd try some help )	-1
i bought this my granddaughter go her new cabbage patch doll she thrilled it . she immediately packed her doll clothes into case pulling case all over house . case big hit her	1

i paid twice price this item location . i wouldn't say it great price but it steal just over $6.00 . it sturdily constructed only six pieces put together(which little difficult uncordinated snap together first ) . once together , pieces stay together nicely . it not game kids play hours ( which why it only received 4 stars ) but they play it repeatedly short bursts time . my advice , give all newcomers chance see how " knock-out " both opponents then play away . even grown-ups end up wanting turn	-1
ball very durable it took me 2 days kicking it hitting it baseball bat break but its heavy hoop handle it but any thing else room	1
my friends i absolutely love this game . i consider it cross outburst trivial pursuit . it all fun spouting off answers like outburst , but you play individual trivial pursuit . smarty pants come game just make it much more clever	1
fabulous twist your average trivia game . one player reader , announces category card rest players . most cards 2 categories - example " characters lord rings : two towers countries belong nato " . reader chooses start player , players take turns naming things they think list . reader uses nifty little device mark correct answers . first player give incorrect answer gets 3 point chip ; next 2 wrong answers get 2 point chip , last few wrong answers get 1 point chip . once all items guessed or all chips gone , round over . each player moves forward number spaces equal their chip value , except smarty pants , person who gave last correct answer - they get throw away one chip . next reader person last place . game ends when one or more players goes over end line board ; winner player closest start . forget trivial pursuit - this much more fun . plus , who wouldn't love game comes pair rubber pants	1

we really enjoyed this game . my dad , me my 4-year-old played together , figuring out solutions . i admit it bit hard my 4-year-old but she ready this eventually ( meantime we play together ) . i would buy one my 6-year-old niece . i wish there replacement pieces now i am little apprehensive losing one essential logs included . instructions easy playing fun ! highly recommended .	1
this game seems quite difficult first , but becomes easier once you realize exactly what rules allow . my 4 year old 7 year old kids enjoyed it short time , but unable grasp complexities past first few levels quickly lost interest ( not surprising this below manufacturer age limit ) . i'm sure older kids would find this fun . adults this game quite addictive , after few days i able solve all 40 levels . if you look inventor site [ ... ] you find much harder plank puzzles . however my 4 star rating mostly because 40 included cards just bit too easy master . " equipment gripe " there exactly minimum number plastic " logs " required cover all games no extras . we now lost one two shortest logs over half puzzles require two these so these can't played any more ( you try substituting other items but real logs fit nicely magnets inside them which quite helpful playing game ) . fortunately thinkfun offers extra game pieces fee ( see their web site ) . i now river crossing 2 , but without missing piece i can't really play it .	-1

tamagotchis awesome ! when i first introduced tamagotchi , i wasn't very interested it until my friend borrowed one classmate . she played jump-rope over over over over - well , you get my point . she loved it ! after watching her play it over over over , well , i got interested . " i wonder how she got glued little video game thing . i'd better find out . " i thought . so when i wal-mart my mom brother , i selected 2 tamagotchis toy section . after i played it while , i thought , " these really cool ! monday i tell my friend i one . " before we got one , my mom said my brother could too . " what ?! no way ! those girls ! " he said . but when he played ... " where my tamagotchi ? i play it please ??? dad , you what cool tamagotchi ? " all i heard him . he never consentrated his homework ! i especially like infra-red communication	1

i very skeptical after reading reviews , but i ordered it anyway , we gave it our son christmas 2005 . he loves it ! i warned my husband what i read how people said it so hard put together . i however , know my husband , he very good way , he no trouble all . i suprised how easy it . it daunting looking millions pieces we opened box but they went together very easily also came apart if we needed . out son loves it , reason i afraid people said , reviews once again , you must find ' mission select " rescue heroes no other ones work . they not readily available stores , not way readily available . so i trusted reviews bought them ebay . but reviews wrong , you not need mission select rescue heroes . you need ' talking ' rescue heroes which readily available toys rus else where . i think amazon it marked , when we bought it , (...) because so many people gave it bad reviews , it bargain our son even uses other people animals it , elevator . he endless fun it . it sparked his imgination .	1
my son this toy year still plays it . he other three r.h. command centers ( older blue tower aquatic command center ) . he loves use them all his missions . it took some time put together but expected . luckily , my son already most mission select action figures , truck police car before getting this center . they hard find stores , but most still found ebay . keep mind , this not include any figures . it keeps him busy still keeps his attention after all this time . we bought it sale it back sale so it worth price any rescue hero fan . great addition this center dvd " rescue heroes : movie " it all mission select guys it this command center seen so after watching he play m.a.c.c. act out missions . this great all rescue hero fans	-1

my daughter got this set her first birthday . all kids enjoyed playing it , it held up extremely well . it appears very heavy-duty , ready years wear tear . only flaw i see , compared other sets , tunnels not attach center section - they just fit inside openings . this makes easy set up , but they also come apart too easily , making center collapse . one rambunctious youngster made game tearing set apart . when my toddler falls against either center or tunnel , they become disconnected . if i hadn't already destroyed packaging , i'd return it set uses velcro ( like playhut ) attach tunnels tents	1
i wish i could give this cube 5 stars ! if it based how much our twins adored toy , i would definitely give it better rating ! however , i feel need mention we initially purchased this toy our 6+ mos old twins within few months battery cover cracked right next on/off switch , leaving batteries easily accessible . duct tape would not even keep cover securely , because cover under so much pressure batteries springs underneath . when our twins 1 1/2 we decided put it christmas wish list , because they both adored first one so much . much our dismay , exact same thing happened battery cover second one ! what huge disappointment ! obviously this toy manufacturing defect i only hope munchkin fixes it future production toy . concept excellent our twins really love it , especially our very musical little girl .	-1

this deluxe version monopoly in-cre-di-ble . sometimes we play it so much we stop don't play it ages , but after few months we play it this deluxe version made playing it so much easier . first , wooden houses hotels . they lot more fun use much easier handle . they're not hollow look real nice , even if they're not so detailed plastic ones . second , gold pieces . pieces absolutely elegant their simple designs their beautiful shiny gold . not real gold , but it makes them all look incredible ! plus , their extra token . it train token , i find it one my favorite tokens now . ( money bag also included)third , banker tray . some people may not like this if they too used taking money out individual trays , but this keeps money together much easier . their slot where you insert money like you would drop envelope drawer , you take it out easily . plus , it three little compartments houses , hotels , small one tokens dice . it really wonderful . fourth , propert carousel . if you ever got angry keeping properties order , you don't need anymore . it small turntable slots each property including railroads utilities . you spin it around whenever you're searching particular one . it extremely handy , you spin it very easily it never wears out . ( if you take out all properties spin turntable smooth surface , it spin ages :-) ) fifth , community chest chance cards not paper . they're now plastic cards coloring their pictures . it looks real shiny new , they're much easier shuffle handle . board also large specially colored rich uncle pennybags middle deluxe edition below him gold letters . really gives whole thing brand new work .

this book so beautiful outside it pity words so incredibly hurtful wrong . story fish who covered beautiful scales . fish comes up asks given one scales beautiful fish says no , after which none other fish play it . fish advised someone " wise " give away its beautiful scales so other fish like it . it follows advise gives every other fish scale so end book page filled bunch pathetic looking fish all one shiny scale everyone supposedly happy . me this terrible moral ! it wrong prettier or smarter or more talented some way ? you should try make yourself less pretty or dumber or ignore your talents so other people won't jealous ? it ok demand other people give you things you covet ? yuk !	-1
" long way out deep blue sea there lived fish . not just ordinary fish , but most beautiful fish entire ocean .

i purchased anakin skywalker model couple months ago very pleased item . hilt well-detailed , maybe too well detailed , proper weight make it feel like real thing . blade very bright , sounds crisp loud . only problem i saber activation switch : it located right center hilt gets way very easily . you hold saber just right avoid bulbous switch . also , it very easy accidently turn it off while you're swinging it ( very annoying ) . still , i loved it anyway you learn handle it better almost right away . i loved anakin model so much , i just get one : it toss up mace windu model or darth vader model . i chose dark side . when it arrived ups today , i immediately wanted grab some aa batteries compare two sabers . vader model just bright anakin ( it red , not pinkish ) but noticeably lighter weight . also , digital sound effects different than anakin model ( that good ) , but vader saber not loud , it also takes moment longer power up power down . it should also noted blue anakin model 4 different clashing sounds ..... red vader model only one . again , activation switch right middle hilt which makes it awkward handle first , but you learn cope it . i guess it makes them more " authentic " . however , actual lightsaber props used dramatic fight sequences not activation switches middle hilts ( it would difficult coreograph fight scene those switches way , so they removed give actors nice , smooth surfaces ..... you wouldn't able see switches since their hands covering up most hilts anyway ) . all all , i am very pleased vader model well . i recommend filming yourself pitch-black area then watch it your tv . it looks cool ! they worth price ? my opinion ..... yes , but careful them . they not toys . one more thing : few people reviewing these items say sabers louder when they chash eachother ..... not true . you're simply hearing two clashing sounds once which makes it seem louder . sabers don't any sensors know specifically when saber smacks it anyway . strike strike . next step ..... mace windu saber	1
i owned many lightsabers , but none quite like this . star wars episode iii anakin skywalker lightsaber complete copy vader actual saber . one push ignition blade surges life , illuminating room everything around you . it great item fight , too , if you bored . i suggest buying two them , namely vader anakin models duel . it awesome	1

lot people complaining bumblebee no longer vw bug . hasbro liscencing reasons why they chose not use car , but same time they could chosen not re-release this character new , highly poseable toy too , so don't complain too loudly ... anyway , yes this car no longer looks like bug , but said , original toy lot smaller didn't actually look like cartoon character either . this version toy very well made headsculpt nearly perfect match what we all saw original cartoons . he door shields , just like new optimus , but bumblebees case i feel they better , since optimus kind flop around when you move his arms . bumblebees not . they lock into place very solidly stuck his arms robot mode . my few complaints , reasons i didn't give this toy 5 stars instead fun , he comes silly " waverunner trailer . " i don't know whose idea this , but trailer/waverunner really feel like afterthought toy . more like " gee this toy needs accessory " type addition than something really thought through . quality plastic paint wave runner not same class quality bumblebee figure area where it hooks onto car just look awkward overall . like someone else mentioned he really should just come gun . my second complaint his " knees " which formed two front seats inside car . it really great car front seats adds additional detail which makes vehicle mode look great . however flaps above feet my toy tend get caught under seats when posing , making it occasionally irratating move legs making me worry i might chip paint leg or seat . its minor thing but it coulda fixed just making seat slightly shorter . all all i am very happy this toy , its great addition puts original bumblebee shame	-1

we got this store i work , we all enchanted ! this very first time any us seen set play food young children sushi ! three kinds sushi come shrimp , tuna , salmon roe , egg pieces . proper condiments included : ginger , wasabi , soy sauce , course , chopsticks ! round " dots " sushi rolls velcro , so you stick pieces together slice through them play cleaver , velcro even gives it almost authentic chopping sound ! it just lovely look . all pieces solid wood , beautifully painted . box black details cherry blossoms , it " menu " back restauraunt pretend play ! i plan get one friend child , but i admit i'm really tempted buy one myself , too	1
i love melissa doug toys , they're always well-made always thoughtful . they encourage learning their pieces , made natural material , not only hold up well but environmentally friendly . this game particularly nice example . it classic wooden puzzle twist . each bug magnet it , players given " butterfly net " magnet hanging it use draw pieces out puzzle . one our pieces stick , but quick rub around edges some sandpaper loosened it right up . downside using real materials wood tendency warp humidity or dryness . that downside i'm willing live ! excellent toy	1
i can't say enough these toys ! they so nicely made feel great your hands . small enough carry around big enough little hands . great quality , sturdy superior look . collectors buying these up like hot cakes ebay living proof people willing shell out cash these . especially ones harder find . people written reviews these no stores carry them . they sold out because there rush these toys even before movie release . hopefully time goes if they keep producing them they easier come . that what i am hoping . i don't all characters yet would like least one each my son , maybe even more collecting . good luck your search !	1
i love phase 10 . this edition comes handy scorepad . it take little longer play than other card games , but it definitely lot fun . my husband i play it alot together also slightly larger groups .	1

this version old fashioned doodle board exceeded my expectations . i purchased it impulsively because our two year old grandson loves both movie " cars " drawing . however , doodle pad larger size than i expected made impressive gift presentation . larger size also makes it easier him draw than he smaller doodle pads . " cars " movie graphics surrounding it really cute , stylus also " cars " character . it arrived my doorstep second day after ordering - regular shipping - perfect shape . all all , i think this my two year old grandson favorite christmas gift - certainly it " hit " him	1
bought this my 3 year old cousin . he opened few other gifts too , but this only one he played night . he didn't use template , though his 9 year old sister picked it up enough coordination use tracing template . maybe after he plays it while he try template . but mostly he just " drove " car screen draw , not mention driving car all over living room floor well	-1
i bought this my almost three year old daughter already knows her shapes , colors , all her letters . this good reinforcer those skills i like handle portability . only downside this laptop tiny led screen . too bad these toys can't made better screen . tiny square middle barbie picture really ridiculous . i would rate this five if it werent tiny screen	-1
this car great purchase . i bought it my one year old . reason i tired wind up toys make them go and/or drive them backwards so they would go forwards their own . this car awesome because even little kids make it go themselves . literally you just shake it it revs up . more you shake it faster/farther it goes . it go really long way . i ratings toys based required parental invovlement . toys require two hands parent not my favorite only used certain times . this zero hand toy parents - best kind . :) i see him enjoying this car few years	1
i love this little car , i bought it my little cousin he absolutely adores it ! it works like magic , you just shake it it runs , kids seem like it	1
i bought this my nine year old who thought she knew her facts , but couldn't her tests them fast enough . one tell shark exactly what skill test ( example , subtracting " 3 " all one digit numbers random order ) . it sets ten questions ( each one either vertical or horizontal format - one can't specify ) , provides immediate feedback child enters each answer . it asks any incorrrect questions again . once all questions answered correctly , it provides time , example , 43.3 seconds . my daughter enjoys seeing her time get better each time she repeats skill . we agreement she 5 sets each day ( total 50 problems ) . she usually 3 sets same skill , each time gets faster . then she reviews two other skills she already mastered . my only complaint display screen hard see , especially side ( so i can't tell what problems she gets wrong , sitting beside her ) . sometimes she'll get problem wrong because she thinks number something else . i think problem might when led right next edge screen , it shadow or something . you turn off sound ( which isn't all loud anyway ) . i really like how specific you setting level challenge . this valuable tool drilling math getting immediate feedback .	-1
math shark fun play because it helps you learn math . math shark educational kids all age	1
i bought this my 2 1/2 year old , she really loves riding it . it good size her she control it suprisingly well . it alot power when fully charged , i even get back she rides me up down driveway . only thing it not reverse	-1
my daughter 2 years old first i thought it would too big her only find out she able ride it no problems . i also thought it would too fast her since it her first battery operated ride-on . but she proved me wrong . it like treat her . when her dad comes home work he allows her ride it down couple blocks him following quickly beside her . only thing he suggested helmet safety procaution . but she really seems enjoy it we get kick watching her ride it . it came pretty much assembled which really nice avoid fustration putting such large item together . i'm very happy i made choice buy one i strongly recommend it my other family members	1

i picked one up local target today general grievous starfighter droid battle pack , both which i've also written reviews . i'm lovin i t.t his set comes 4 clone trooper minifigs , 2 white , one red , one yellow . markings pretty nice . there only 2 blasters set binoculars four clones , but blasters speeder andgun turret you take off if you need extra . blasters new , shaped like normal clone trooper blaster nicely detailed . speeder cool . it seats two clones , driver gunner . turret really isn't anything special . gun isn't movable , but it larger than other blasters looks cool clone scout . i would swapped turret clone minifig blaster , butthat just me . basically , you get 4 clone troopers , mediocre gun turret , nive speeder just $10 ! it great building clone army since it so cheap , it really cool if you already clone turbo tank or republic gunship . pick few these up , you won't regret it	1

without doubt , flip `n play table chicco my son favorite " baby " toy ! fact , my boy wasn't willing give it up until he 3-years old . i could probably write pages , pages flip `n play table , because it so well loved , developmental qualities endless . i emphasized word " baby " first sentence review , because i think age recommendation could easily altered 9-months up . william 8-months old when he received this table christmas , he needed very little introduction . he played spinning sphere beads , clock spinning hands , because developmentally he wasn't able other activities . sphere rattles makes lots noise , which always entertains little ones . phone , button makes choo choo sounds early favorites too . we didn't use leg supports probably 3-months ; because william wasn't walking yet , i concerned he might fall forward . once he steady his feet , leg support went he would stand , or kneel up toy . then , when he started climbing , he'd climb right inside bin all blocks , play . it cutest thing , although , i put stop because i wasn't comfortable him 13 " off floor even though we carpeting . i'd take legs off table , he'd climb bin while it rested floor . he just happy way , i didn't worry him falling . once he understood lever activated train , he heaven . it makes loud winding sound , which startled him first , but then he enjoyed noise . we'd wind track time , time again . time he started playing shape sorter too . unlike other shape sorters , this one requires you sort shapes properly . there only three shapes , circle , square , triangle so it rudimentary . i think last activities my son able flip book , manipulating rotary dial . he didn't stack blocks quite some time either . he'd play blocks , mostly twirl them floor , bang them together . he almost 2 before he started stacking , building blocks . his first birthday , i added supplementary set , light `n sound circus train , which really added play value this toy . it gave him more blocks stack , since there no stacking order , designs endless . i'm especially satisfied performance flip `n play table . it extremely durable , easy care well . i've placed bin , legs , blocks dishwasher without concern . due mechanisms , tabletop should cleaned damp cloth . chicco make exceptional toys developmental yet , fun . i highly recommend this plaything , chicco line products .	1

my wife i wanted get radio flyer our 4 month old son christmas , but we wanted only best so it could grow him . i researched this alot . this largest wagon radio flyer makes . bottom sides all wooden construction siderails removeable just lifting up them ( although thight fit ) . we though wesley would like ability take sides off little boys love disassemble things . this wagon also pneumatic ( air up ) tires , it came tires inflated . we it put together 30 minutes opening box , although i cordless drill phillips attachment run screws . all holes pre drilled instructions very easy . we found there no stores dallas/fort worth area carried this wagon . rf makes wagon metal base wooden siderails , but sides bolted onto it not easily removable without tools -- we didn't want one . we also disappointed wal-mart target because they only carried plastic wagons seats drink holders our area ... we wanted real wagon . anyway , amazon came through product we wanted , significantly lower cost other online stores time ( we paid $119 , while several places same wagon $150-199 ) delivered it great shape . our 4 month old ... now we prop him up some pillows wagon he loves pulled around ... but i'm sure this wagon still fun when he 10 years old	1

my [ ... ] loves this desk . he really works book came leappad , loves his art desk now . he usually wants interact only other people involved , but this , he focus so much his desk , i dare not bother him . i would given it 5 stars , but chair makes me worry little . he pretty careful , but admittedly , style chair makes it too easy tip . he hasn't tipped over , but parents should still keep this mind . i am very happy this purchase	-1
my son loves this desk ! he 3 it hard keep his attention . this desk it	1
our first foray into leapfrog when our oldest turned three . she both loved learned my first leappad ( ages 3 5 ) we got her . so when she turned four , my mother bought her full-fledged leappad learning system you see here . according box which it came , it suppose age appropriate kids 4 up . compared my first leappad , my daughter finds this version older kids more difficult manage . not so much activities learning activities , but rather larger sized activity pad , activity books not durable , cartridges more difficult four year-old-to handle , basically host other small things . so while my four-year-old use this system when my wife i ( or other adult relatives ) around , her own she prefers my first leappad she finds much more manageable four year old . said , i still give it four stars because some my daughter friends , who year or two older than her , love this this system handle it just fine . also , month-by-month my daughter starting handle this system lot better . anyway , if your child over four you don't version younger kids , it would probably worth it start them this system . if you child only three , however , get my first leappad . if you version younger kids thinking up upgrading this version , wait until your child outgrown first one .	-1
this first leap book my son would read . although he likes idea tad other creatures gladly sit read hour , 3 other books we get maybe 5 minutes his attention . this first one he sit down read/play himself 30 minutes or more ( he super hero obsessed ) . i wanted superman one but after reading reviews it decided this because it read individual words more his level ( just 6 starting 1st grade fall ) . there some great games encourage visual distiction some really interesting facts spiders some good letter sound stuff too . i love it , he loves it , i wish they would more comic based stuff it goes over great here .	1

i love room this wagon ... but way handle made dangerous . it hit my 3 year old head couple times . it designed fold inwards instead out isn't greatest idea . it also might just defective one i received but i found it too tippy . which also dangerous . i really researched these wagons i thought i going getting best one according all reviews i read but i am not satisfied it all . i am now working researching some more new one i decided i would probably just better off going store personally check them out myself .	-1

we just got this mail , it went together very well . took while get one we ordered it right before christmas . i used their screws my own screwdriver - screwdriver comes it small , so i see where others may problem . didn't any screws break , one strip out , but my fault i tightened it too far . remember folks , you dealing soft wood here , so don't go crazy your screwdriver . not use screw gun ( power drill ) , you defintely problems . my 3 year old using it right now loves it . so far drawn cat dog , going some trouble separating it go bed . money , this winner .	-1
year half , our daughter went through phase where she wanted mommy keys all time . enter this key ring , so she could her own keys . good points : - they metal-looking keys klink , instead plastic obviously-fake keys . - they're easy handle- sounds lights fun during car trips . only downside : sounds very realistic . grandma gone get door few times when door button pushed . dad freaked out when driving car , she pushed honking horns/traffic noise . tip : she didn't want play them until i pretended use them car house . once she thought they " real " she interested	1

i bought this item two years ago specifically my then-5yr-old daughter . she wanted drum set , i didn't want spend lot money one . my daughter enjoyed pounding drums , but drums not great quality electronic crash cymbal or thump drum pad hardly heard above din wooden drumstick against hard plastic . unit top-heavy easily bumped fall over . footpad essentially useless . sum , i should either paid more money get nice yamaha electronic drumset , or real drumset , or just forestalled decision entirely . after i couldn't take rukkus my kids pounding ( not playing ) thing , i hauled it up attic there it ever since . interestingly , my kids never asked it again	-1

i wasn't sure what think this when my 9 year old daughter picked this out birthday present . after setting it up , reading simple directions , playing few games it , i'm pleasantly surprised i'm hooked it ! object move your " mirrors " one time cause your laser cannon reflect your mirrors onto your opponents " tower . " first one hit opponents tower their laser winner -- evidenced flashing lights explosion sound . kids really get big kick out this . although rules say you only make one move or adjustment your mirrors time only test fire your laser once after each move , my kids flexible rule . they make several adjustments per move which makes game faster keeps them getting frustrated . my 9 10 year old play this each other but it little too difficult my 5 7 year olds . careful lasers though , they real low-level lasers should never pointed anyone eyes . so if your kids aren't responsible enough handle , i'd stay away . otherwise , give it try i think you'll like it too	-1
my son loves this little colorful house . it great teaching tool get your young ones learn their colors shapes also because use keys open lock doors , it also improves their fine motor skills . my son 2 half help this house , he knows all shapes colors how match keys right doors . wonderful purchase	1
just case you wonder if it collection , it same metal cars " normal " or regular edition . it only country or provider ( i guess ) . but they brilliant idea develop more cars movie . well , not more cars but more variant models . example , they this version mcqueen ( it looks last part movie ) . they first mater ( not re-colored one bowling game ) complete nose ( you get ) , dirt mcqueen ( like one one track game ) , hudson hornet ! yellow ramone . i uploaded back cover box just your entertainment . it whole catalog ! peru it costed me $9 each but they so hard get . it happened here they just disappeared regular stores .	1
this item very cheaply made . some parts not stay together , etc . i am happy price i paid it through amazon --- thankfully i didn't pay what it selling stores ! but notice right after christmas it clearance approximately 70% off . alone lets you know it not best quality . my daughter tried enjoy this toy , but pieces falling off she just got fed up . it least played her toys . she owns numerous little mommy products really enjoys dolls . retail prices toddler doll activity center certainly led me believe they would better quality	-1

i no idea how tiny these dolls going . there should something advertising let collector mcfarlane nba dolls know these not normal size ; , fact , miniatures . they hardly look like anybody , let alone allen iverson chris webber . huge disappointment me my son	-1
i've read several reviews this item quite honestly , i don't understand why so many people posted negative reviews . this wonderful toy allows children creative . my 5-year-old son thoroughly enjoyed this product . i gave him wet rag use clean it which work better than sponge comes toy . i am not big stencils since they restrict creativity but he used them trace designs onto doodle pro board which encourage fine motor development . overall , great toy take car or resturant or simply use make brilliant drawings home .	1
my daughter 4 years old loves trace so i decided her doodle pro glow . outside it looked like snap wipe clean , what mistake ! first you make sure your child not smear marker ( which stains ) all over place , second they provide you tiny sponge ( not same picture box)and you wash it clean after every stroke across board . i don't know you but i get tired running back fourth trying keep it clean . third you then wipe board clean dry cloth since wet sponge never gets all it off . take my advice pass up this toy go simple doodle pro , much easier all around .	1
radio flyer seriously messed up when they designed this trike . part concept great ... it folds up ! second part concept telescoping handle not steer , kinda jiggly start , isn't wide enough you really steer your kid . problem lies design . you can't ability co-pilot like other radio flyer trikes because it folds up . disconnects handle rear front wheel , which what steers . it jiggles around because it telescopes out , meaning all those little spaces where one segment fits into next equals lot room time you pull it out all way . you can't easily steer ( you pick up back or lift front turn if you steering locked ) , you push back forth keep it going straight . this hard small handle they put this thing . save your money get one their other ones , which all great reviews	-1
i bought this trike my one year old grandson although he out town my daughter says he loves it even enjoys pushing other people around it . so it seems great present probably first many bikes he his life	-1
this your best way purchase these ! these all we use we love them !	1
i bought this bike my daughter 3rd birthday . she absolutely loves it . she rides it all time it one only bike she reach get peddles around all way . this bike wonderful littler child who can't seem quite reach peddles other similar size bikes . way it built enables child reach without uncomfortable sitting way forward . it great !!	1
i got this my son 9th birthday . it looked like so much fun , but it just bunch colored ping pong balls top hair dryer . lots tiny pieces . they invented lot ridiculously complicated games disguise essential boringness . i almost returned it but couldn't face repacking . no one plays it , i'll probably pitch it into trash few weeks	-1
bought this christmas although it assemble easily looked great my daughter able turn handle bars get them out alignment . i tried several times tighten handle bars but no matter what i it always easy turn handle bars they slip out place . also front wheel out alignment not perpendicular ground ( review mentioned same thing so apparently it not just one i bought ) . very disappointing i returning it	-1
i requested this cart my 2 yr . old last christmas - it cute " goes " her dolly , but i really wish i'd asked more sturdy cart . she likes basket separates , but handle so flush basket , she only put smaller things it . i thought it'd fun basket seat detach , but they difficult child put back she ask me it . plus , both her dollies ' legs get caught seat so she can't get them out either . most food things cardboard , which i yes , laminated packaging tape , they still not hold up . banana , milk dish cute , but i don't think they warrent choosing this cart	-1
my husband i just bought this toy my daughter today . she loved her cousin ' similar ' toy ( different brand ) , but we thought this product cuter , although more expensive . well after 20 minutes play , we decided it needed go back several reasons : 1 . wheels very cheaply made not turn ( her cousin cart turned like real cart ) . 2 . basket way too small . 3 . basket comes off too easily . 4 . cardboard boxes obviously silly wouldn't last minute if we given them her , but cuteness other food items outweighed this negative point us . due numbers 1 3 above , my daughter became easily frustrated cart not turning . but good sport , she moved around other side trying turn it way , but then course basket ( which almost falls off anyway ) , gives way she fell flat her face . shame us choosing " cute " over sturdy ! beware - this product may unsafe . we're taking it back today exchanging it same one her cousin 1/3 price - we already know it turn , basket large , it won't fall apart !	-1

we attached imaginative minds keyboard extra computer we put it children playroom . they love it ! teaches them colors , what color combinations make ( red yellow make orange ! ) , shapes they love music . initial software bit limited older children ( we 1 , 2 4 year old use this)but just fine younger one . buttons nice large little hands manipulate but i think children little disappointed phone didn't work i fear it lost quickly since it not attached . all all little pricey but very solid entertaining product . definitely plus you switch other language well !	1
my daughter plays this every day . awesome toy . this only toy i know you play so many languages . very educational	1
we purchased this toy becuase my husband one when he toddler - 51 years ago ! while we still toy it gone through many children hands not very playable our own kids now . i thought remake would alike but it isn't . " grun-grun " sound not same much toy made plastic instead wood . string quite short so not practical even my two year old pull unless i add longer string it . overall it cute dog durable looking toy -but i wonder it last well 50+ year old original ?	-1
i purchased this game highest hopes expectations . it turned out fun 15 30 minutes . most audio just cuts off many places , movement very choppy overall , boards they give you write down amount prizes you've won , yeah well , it would nice if they gave you amount ! they give you nothing kind pricing games , so what boards ?! i could go , but i won't . this game could so much better , i am not thrilled all	-1

i find this set exactly set i played 1970s . five pages shapes spiral bound book - there tons shapes which great . my kids , younger than suggested age 21 months old , really seem enjoy this toy - they love stickers , however unlike stickers , colorforms don't ruin furniture when stuck wood ! our colorforms not stick well two included boards all - fact , they fell right off . i saw reviewer mention this well . i called manufacturer they sending me set - hopefully these work better . i am hoping these isolated incidents not overall product problem . all all , good toy good play value !	-1

dvd version this game terrible . syncing up buzzer remotes dvd player lengthy process . if successful , once synced buzzers seem effective only half time during game play . however , biggest problem game if you play game more than once , several questions repeat which makes repeat playing game unfun	-1

first off , i address issue choo-choo sound constantly going off . same thing happened our puzzle , constantly ! i realized sound light-activated ... when all pieces put together , " sensor " goes off because darkness . if there any pieces missing lights go off , same thing happens , because sound triggered light/darkness . great product - fun brightly colored . however , little pegs serve handles each individual piece may come loose disattach , posing choking hazard child . use parental supervision	-1
this must if you geotrax starter set . my son received basic tracktown railway 2 1/2 we immediately went out bought him elevation track packs . adults set layout up , its little bit trickier 3 dimensions , but elevation what makes geotrax way better than any other train set ! only drawback you can't just buy one elevation track pack . this one would most logical buy if you only buy one set though . it ramps get up level 2 , but this much more fun if you get up level 3 . i would recommend adding ramps this set . we 1 each 3 elevation packs that enough connect all elevation accessories we ( clock tower , suspension bridge , mile high mountain ) . definitely add your geotrax , its worth it ! your child love it so yo	1

this toy godsend ! william received this activity center his 1st birthday , he adored it ! when he little , i'd place bear ville activity center center living room floor , he'd play 45-minutes or more . this toy never got old him because i rotated his toys . moreover , this plaything keeps kids interested , because there so many activities explore . progressive learning great too . children understand almost instantly how get garage spinning , it probably highlight unit . shape sorter entertaining too . unlike other shape sorters , this unit requires shapes sorted properly , which i like . it led bit frustration early , but he caught , enjoyed aspect enormously . stairway one activity took while catch . he didn't understand how operate catapult movement until he probably 2-years old , but then he'd snap bear place continually fling him off platform . this produced many fits laughter ! william now 4� outgrown toy ; however , he still asks play it when he full service garage out . i'm not sure why , but his mind , they go together . only safety concern we've encountered bear ville activity center shape sorter . soon after william received toy , he tried retrieve circular shapes forcing his hand entrance point , rather than flipping door open . his hand stuck , he cried , but it didn't discourage his play session . he continued play if nothing happened . i think if there any room improvement , i'd suggest company they eliminate circular shape exchange maybe diamond , or heart-shape so children can't wedge their little hands circular opening . if you've read any my other chicco toy reviews , you know i think they're fabulous playthings ! they heavy-duty , developmental , toys children seem love . bear ville activity center dropped , even stepped upon umpteen times , shows little signs wear . it easy clean too . just apply soapy water cloth , minutes , it ready play . definitely winner our household .	1

my two-year-old son loves all his wooden thomas trains ! they keep him busy hours extremely durable . someone gave us some metal/plastic thomas trains , he plays them too , but their plastic parts break quickly ( ie : harold plastic helicopter blades , plastic " link-ups " , etc . ) wooden ones magnets seem last forever , only minor paint wear resulting lots lots playtime ! used conjunction videos or books , they teach things like proper behavior all those good " moral " examples . plus , they teach colors numbers because design each individual train . he loves james ' bright red color . fact they not battery-powered not absolutely require track huge " plus " me . they go anywhere , anything house serve railway track . it only limited your child imagination ( climbing ability . ) we visit friend house recently who battery-powered thomas , my son enjoy it also , so we may possibly getting few those add collection holidays . reviewer felt they " dinky " disappointed size trains . me , one best features . i said , they go anywhere ( keeps him busy restaurant ! ) they perfectly proportioned fit very well into small hands . plus , they don't take up so much space your house , especially if you start whole collection ! however , warned they underfoot all times because your kids love play them so much , so watch your step . sometimes simplest thing best thing , i think that definitely case thomas trains	1
i bought my son james reward because james one his favorites ( it might james my son middle name , but who knows ) . james , other big engines coal cars , they my son favorites . fact , he take all coal cars , put them together one train pull them . he figured out only one train pulls cargo , not pulls other trains . anyone who complains price isn't thomas fan . thomas pricey , plain simple , but you also getting lifetime guarentee . if anything breaks , they send you new one	1
my daughter got this when she 9 or 10 . she now almost 12 still uses it . it true nail polish not same quality adult polish , but because it thick opaque it makes it easier designs . even if polish runs out , book designs instructions still used . my daughter always using it decorate her own her friends ' nails . it probably helps if your child fairly good fine motor skills .	-1

this board game awesome . you get create your own monopoly game using computer paper more . although , it take time patience create it . you need computer create your own monopoly . without computer , you'll write property names boards create your own deed cards . if you don't computer , i would recommend getting one now . you can't create one without computer just incase you sloppy handwriting . you also need creative . without creative , you never think title call your opoly	-1

i love game pente . it one those games deceptivly simple . i learned love this game one old style paper boards . you would weigh down corners prevent curling . not so this version . instead paper , it mat so it stays flat . bottom grips table , so there no slipping . i even believe mat resistant spills . yet , it still simple roll back up so it easily fits back into tube . i highly recommend it !	1
i ordered this item excited relive some childhood memories game very disappointed . what i hoping would reproduction original instead ugly , overpriced mousepad ! print quality board joke . very blurry ugly blue instead nice cream color original .. instead thin piece leather-like material like original , board same thickness mousepad thick rubber backing everything . ok , no big deal , right ? wrong ! imagine how disappointed i when i rolled up board discover board stones not fit into tube ! no wonder they ship it outside tube box ! glass stones much like original , but very light color -- this only good thing going set so i'll give it 1 star . i sent this item back immediately upon receipt would encourage anyone else interested pente find original set not buy this joke reproduction	-1

i purchased pink one major toy store $319 . what $600 price here ? i thought $319 lot . anyway , everyone loves this vehicle it worth price because children just never get bored it . it powerful drive grass up down gradual sidewalks . i bought it my 7-year old she her friends all love it she still fit into car until age 9 , i guess ( she normal-sized child ) . radio cannot heard when driving though . " seat belts " velcro them " decoration only " so they don't really secure child into car . passenger , my 2-year old actually fell out door onto sidewalk when car driven up gradual curb . so i went fabric store purchased plastic buckles ( like ones strollers ) also purchased nylon belt ( like strollers ) which sold yard . belt easily threads through seat works well . i didn't sew -- just tied knots buckles stay . really , putting these " seat belts " so easy monkey could it it necessary children who younger than kindergarten . i walking right next car but my toddler fell out so fast even my quick reflexes i could not catch him ( mom nightmare ) . manufacturer probably not include real seat belts liability purposes . again , this car may expensive , but well worth it we probably sell it after my child outgrows it . btw , my son shares this computer so there some reviews him under this name	1
let me start off saying we love this toy . however , we our 2nd one . we bought our 4 year old black one christmas . we problems our radio day one . march i stopped toysrus talk manager tell him problem . he easily swapped it out gave us new pink/purple one . which awesome . however , again we started problems radio . it started shutting itself off when you hit bump , then decided stay not go off until batteries ran out . i called buyers protection plan people asked this problem . i informed they getting almost daily calls radios not working . they suggested store manager get touch manufacturer see if there fix . obviously we still fun without radio , but it very nice feature . we would still buy again because my daughter best time it	-1

there simply no way anyone could like this safe . 1 ) drawer cannot take * any * weight . forget even putting few coins it it because once you , it won't open ! 2 ) it eats batteries like 500lb man eats hamburgers . literally full pack aa batteries every few weeks ! reason , this thing flashes lights even when nobody near it or it not use . 3 ) cheap construction , this thing engineered fail . half time drawer fails open , keypad fails work , it flakes out other half time . avoid this junk all costs	-1
i gave this 5 star rating toy not safe !! my 9yr old daughter received this safe christmas gift it her favorite out all toys she got . best part combination easily reset so when it forgotten you still get your stuff . alarm security code she loves hiding away her gameboy her younger sister . this not secure functional safe -- it toy drawer easily resetable combination code . great younger kids . my 4yr old wants one her birthday now so she hide away her treasures her siblings	1

sigh . brings back memories . this exactly same i remember my childhood . metal sounds , strength , cool light reflections , durability much better than you find newer plastic models , price right . my only complaint it comes shipped absurd amount packaging several times size actual toy , which wasteful annoying wade through . but once it open , it bring hours entertainment -- yes , it still walks down stairs	-1
every household needs one . my son spent hours watching his slinky go down our staircase . we all giggled cheered when it made it all way . simple toy needs no bells or whistles . just good clean fun	1

my daughter recv'd this ant farm her 5th b-day . we ordered ants , unfortunately they came when we away vacation . basically all dead . i called company they resent more ants free charge . we got our new ants within 2 weeks . i absolutely just love watching them ( maybe more than my kids ) . i also 3 year old . it so interesting such learning experience . they so maitenance free . i definately recommend this ant farm .. it interesting fun . ants very social creatures . i also purchased whole kit . it many interesting things learn it .	1
all i say she rocks all dolls ! they all so beautiful ! someone said roxxi weird shaped head she ugly . what mean ?! all heads same ! i think they all so attractive ! buy them all ! rock angelz forever ! -courtney , rock fan singe	1
first when i saw rock angelz bratz i thought it strange jade cloe white hair . then i saw rock angelz movie began like dolls . i found them sale bought cloe doll rock angelz sasha my friend birthday . when i got cloe out package i realized her hair actually very pale blond instead white , brown streaks . her eyes brownish color . her rock angelz outfit consists white top , black jacket , denim pants , red hat , red boots . i didn't really like boots over pants first but now i've gotten used it . after concert she change into black top red mini skirt . my opinion both outfits look better without hat . cloe also comes some things . main accessories include shiny red doll stand , microphone microphone stand , guitar , mini cd containing rock angelz theme cloe song , " you think . " i liked second song best . smaller accessories include orange sunglasses , jewelry , lipstick , cell phone , red star shaped hairbrush . parents should know doll supposed pierced bellybutton . there small jewel her stomach . i mentioned this because some people may not want their kids see doll . i rate her 5 stars durability , but i don't play mine , so i'm not sure how it would hold up if child constantly played doll carried it around , but bratz dolls i since i younger held up well , except slightly faded clothing chips lipstick . i only give it 1 star educational , because it doesn't really teach anything . i give her 5 stars fun , but i'm not really sure , either . i am almost teenager i collect bratz dolls instead playing them , but my older bratz dolls fun when i child . i recommend this doll , especially older children or collectors . younger children can't really keep track small accessories included .	1

my 2 year old granddaughter loves bear . she little young it so we watch her carefully it . she so excited when he starts talking telling stories . only problem we when you open package , it not clear there no cartridge comes bear book . first story already programmed into bear . i didn't realize until we went hasbro website .	-1
i 5 year old son he loves books read . i can't devote all my time reading him ... don't get me wrong i still every day but tj my big helper . while i am cooking dinner or cleaning house my son listen stories i my hands free but best all we still getting storytime together he loves it . speech comment made one review i look it tj supposed 5 years old . i personally think it adds little something special toy	1
love this bear . soft , durable , so cute moving head , ears , arms . cute story , like you purchase more stories . thought it great price such nice product . i got it my 10 month old granddaughter christmas . smiles expressions my granddaughters face she listened him first time pricless made my daughter cry she watched her . says it all	1
my opinion this way games supposed : rules easy understand , easily learned 5 minutes . typical game takes 15 minutes . mastering game takes much longer --- i can't tell you how long , because i haven't mastered it yet . i've played this game quite few times now , am amazed complexity involved game play . every move you make , you judge tradeoff knowledge you gain knowledge you give your opponent(s ) . you even try fool your opponent(s ) , making move would seem obviously wrong your point view ( but confusion may pay off later ) . i would say it much more interesting game than mastermind , or most games , because it depends less chance more skill . it great lesson logic reasoning game theory . i would say coda almost interesting complex games like go , bridge or chess , but much easier learn quicker play . i concur one other reviews i read : coda classic making . highly recommended	1
awesome present- my 4 year old nephew loved it . he got it christmas this past year it still holding up strong . great , realistic , paint job holding up well many ' crashes ' . they great buy also . i highly recomend them .	1

i am 26 i played this game my husband my grandparents while vacation we loved it . we rented beachhouse it one games there so we decided purchase it more family fun	-1
i didn't read fine print missed " accessory boxed set " . this contains mask , very small cape , light saber . it not include any pants . cape 4'8 " boy only went down waist -- not down knees , so label it one size fits all very deceptive . not sure why " accessory boxed set " would include cape top portion costume . accessories would items like saber gloves , perhaps voice changer add . anyway , this rip off don't waste your time buying this anyone over 3 feet tall . i'm returning this one .	-1
this great toy teaching little ones cause effect . we got it my son 6 months he loved it since very beginning . he figured out two buttons right away able trigger them himself , unlike similar toys other companies which much harder trigger . he so excited see animals pop up hear music when he pushed little lever or pulled little ring . now , 16 months , he still plays it sometimes , know animals their sounds . overall it great toy last your child long time	1

my son i great expectations this game ; our expectations quickly turned disappointment . this " game " really hard call game . it more like one long reading exercise . unlike many other l-max games , wherein you learn modules through interactive play , this one you read read read same story over again . once you complete story , you then go area " unlock " game . then order play " game " you read some more . this not type game where you standby provide guidance when needed , i found myself reading page , after page , after page , just figure out myself objective " game " then try explain it my son . i felt money i paid this game waste , no wonder when i went purchase it , it only one stock . buyers beware	-1

( it * * however improvement books i remember when i younger ... just white marker ... picture lots black gray changed colors when you used marker ...	1

i thought this paddle edition jakks retro atari games improvement over their joystick edition . it easier control game options thanks lot interactivity on-screen lets you know difficulty settings such . this one includes arcade versions pong warlords boot ! i found control pretty easy use , though not great i remember atari paddles working ( but i so much younger then , possibly better eye-hand coordination ) . this great collection atari games including night driver , street racer , video olympics ( pong ) , warlords ( atari arcade versions ! ) , steeple chase , circus atari ( also found joystick one ) , demons diamonds , breakout , super breakout , casino , canyon bomber . nice mix driving , tennis , arcade shooters , breakout style games ( pretty much what you want paddle ! ) . there two-player edition available makes pong better game . but computer not unbeatable , there several settings all games make them what they always - simple play classics . i've enjoyed every edition tv games so far ( atari , activision namco -- no , i don't spongebob or blue clues ) . nice thing they portable load quickly . i like not unpack fire up my video game console every time i want quick diversion . overall this great addition my growing collection retro games .	-1
this so far our favorite gamewright game our family . it took little while our 5 year old learn game , but he now play his own known win , really annoys our 13 year old . this some strategy involved this game . you easily play two people or 6 people . we 5 our family . it nice game we all play one time it isn't time consuming monopoly . each player dealt 4 cards face down . you line up cards front you face down . you allowed look two cards end , but not cards middle . you take turns drawing card pile middle(which face down ) or picking card top discard pile(which face up . you try exchange your higher numbered cards lower numbers . you try get all four cards low possible ( 0 9 ) then you shout out rat ' tat cat . everyone gets one more chance then you add up points . score keeper records adds up points each player . object game get lowest number points adding up all 4 cards end round . we ussually play 50 or 100 points , people get 50 points they would out game . each time there round dealer shuffles entire deck passes out 4 more cards per player . each person gets turn deal . there peek cards , allowing you peek card you may not now . there draw 2 cards , giving you two chances get low number card , if you don't want card you draw you just place it face up discard pile . there swap cards , allowing you swap card player , so paying attention important . all 4 cards always kept face down . you only look two end cards before play begins , you look card you draw just one time . after no peeking allowed , so you try remember what infront you sometimes you take chance two middle cards , since you don't now what those cards unless you get peek card or you just risk it discard card . it isn't complicated it sounds , but it take while our 5 year old beable play without partner . our kids beg play this game us . cards could made better , they aren't very well laminated .	1

wake explosion number baseball card sets produced each year i , like anne father jane austen father , retrenched . only set i pick up each year " basic " set put out topps . i not this because topps provides more " first year " players prospects eternal quest official " rookie " card some future hall famer , but because i currently complete run topps baseball card sets going back 1968 ( i also complete sets 1956 , 1961 , 1964-66 , four hall famers go finish 1953 couple dozen high numbers complete 1967 set ) . all these sets arranged binders beginning leader cards , then highlights , post season world series cards . then all teams arranged they finished , beginning world champion red sox , all those aforementioned first year prospect cards back . so i am here history not gum ( not there gum anymore , but you get point ) . 733 cards 2005 topps set broken down into 534 veterans , 30 managers ( 267-296 ) , 35 first year subjects ( 297-326 ) future stars ( 327-331 ) , 17 season highlights ( 332-336 ) including postseason ( 349-55 ) world series ( 731-34 ) 12 league leaders ( 337-348 ) , 24 sporting news all-stars ( 356-367 , 719-730 ) , 30 team photos ( 638-67 ) , 25 draft picks ( 668-87 ) prospects ( 688-92 ) , 2 combos ( 693-94 ) 24 award winners including rawlings gold gloves ( 695-712 ) , cy young ( 713-14 ) , mvp ( 715-716 ) , rookie year ( 717-18 ) . then you also get 5 cello-wrapped prospect cards featuring players who not part topps series 1 or 2 . aware you get set those five cards prospects few select teams , namely new york yankees , boston red sox , chicago cubs , san francisco giants , detroit tigers , washington nationals . i supposed such cards might considered key inducement buying complete set , but fact you get complete set without open dozens packs series 1 then waiting same series 2 should enough ( unless , course , you like opening pack see if you might find rocket , a-rod , or ichiro ) . two things remember 2005 topps set . first , reason there 733 cards but last card numbered 734 because topps retired card #7 honor mickey mantle after he passed away . it made sense since mantle 1952 topps rookie card ( which also high number ) icon baseball card collecting . honus wagner t206 holy grail just getting see one would thrill but forget every owning one ( whereas you sell you card get 52 mantle ) . second , release series 1 series 2 , barry bonds made deal topps . why he not appear front ( nor he mentioned back ) 2004 national league batting average leaders card ( 343 ) , even though he led nl batting ( his name appear back nl home run leaders card ( 345 )) . but you find this year he both regular card ( 500 ) 2004 national league mvp award card ( 716 ) . he should shot giants team ( 662 ) , but i would not swear it . bonds must gotten swear deal since his logo appears below mlbpa logo bottom box .	-1

my daughter loves elmo , she excited see her new elmo toy her 2nd borthday , she loves when it plays music she dances around , but when you turn pages it play follow light game instead just playing music , she found bit frustrating	-1
personally , i don't like this toy all ready return it after we it home two hours -- my toddler , however , different ideas!!elmo head moves very stiffly slightly different color his body . sound very " tinkly " just doesn't sound like high quality toy . fact , one point i thought elmo speaking different language -- it wasn't until my husband listened toy we able figure out elmo saying " follow lights . " however , my 21 month old loves this toy played it multiple times day since we brought it home . she even wanted take it bed her first night wouldn't go upstairs until she put her elmo piano " night-night " family room ! she no problems pressing keys turning pages piano book . she also quickly found on/off switch sometimes startles herself turning volume onto loud setting . one games ( lack better word ) this toy " follow lights " game where child plays song they press lit up piano keys -- this way too advanced young child she no interest this feature . even though i'm not fan toy , based my daughter love it , i gave this piano 4 star rating	-1
you see jackie robinson hit ball ? he hit it boy , ain't all . he stole home . yes , yes , jackie real gone . front packaging this cooperstown series 3 figure jackie robinson brooklyn dodgers , it informs us he " first rookie year mlb history . " course , not exactly why robinson hall fame or why one smartest things they ever major league baseball retired robinson #42 all teams ( there only one active player still wearing number because grandfather clause , mariano rivera , who also heading cooperstown ) . suffice it say this bit understatement regarding importance jackie robinson baseball history . first thing said this mcfarlane toys action figure they picked perfect pose remembering jackie robinson , showing him stealing home , just like it talks woodrow buddy johnson song , " you see jackie robinson hit ball ? " quoted above . it also how jackie shown 33 cent stamp issued commemorate 1940s 20 cent commemorative stamp honor robinson post office put out 1982 . not only robinson break color barrier when he joined brooklyn dodgers 1947 but he brought speed game negro leagues major leagues , stealing home 19 times . this time it makes sense not only jackie uniform but also home plate covered dirt slide . figure held base single pin you want sure adjust it so left shin nestles up against little raised pile dirt front home plate . this means jackie left foot touching home plate so he clearly safe . this smaller pin already base where you stick jackie hat , which fallen his head . there limited articulation this figure : head two arms both adjusted slightly . however , pose you see above basically what you going end up when you display this one . finally , additional bonus points sculpting job they jackie face , which one best mcfarlane toys turned out date . it lists robinson playing 2b , which main position 1948-52 ( he played 1b his rookie season mostly 35 his last years baseball ) . far i am concerned all baseball fans should figures babe ruth jackie robinson , because they two most important players baseball history it not matter who you root ( babe series 2 , although there sepia toned version figure out there well ) . other five action figures series 3 cooperstown collection mickey mantle new york yankees ( 3-time american league mvp ) , roberto clemente pittsburgh pirates ( 11-time all-star ) , carlton fisk boston red sox urging his famous home run game 6 1975 world series stay fair fenway park ( 11-time all-star ) , nolan ryan california angel ( all-time strikeout king ) , don mattingly new york yankees ( yankee captain 1985 american league mvp ) . it great figures great players past there certainly some more members dodgers both brooklyn ( e.g , roy campanella , duke snider ) los angeles ( e.g. , sandy koufax , don drysdale ) who i hope see future cooperstown series .	-1

hasbro making some quality star wars toys this no exception . few weeks ago , i looking this my son could not find it . i find non-star wars version maker . other gun all sorts sounds , some which sound more like elevator doors than laser blaster . it irritating . we finally found this blaster bought it . ( silly string version all over place , but who wants clean up silly string constantly replace canisters ) . laser blaster solid . plastic used construction strong solidly put together . you never get feeling it would easy break ( though i didn't test its limits ) . when you tap sides your finger nails , it almost sounds like solid piece plastic , rather than molded sections . also , sounds realistic . while there only two sounds , they what you expect laser blaster sound like . lighting barrel looks good . however , it seems ' light ' too long . i guess that just realism thing let face it , laser blasters not yet real . even so , i still think flash should shorter . overall , i think it best laser gun toy i seen . it looks cool , its sounds make it play cool , it tough nails . don't fear expense . i think it worth every bit $20	1
no young star wars fan effectively re-live scenes star wars movies without blaster ! my son already 5 lightsabers , but could never pretend general grievous , han solo , or storm trooper . then course , when i played padme or leia , i needed gun . now he blaster , he happiest little jedi ever . so far , it seems pretty sturdy . it lights up sounds realistic too . cool toy	-1

my 2.5 yr old loves this bear . she received it christmas present . she feeds it , takes care it carries it everywhere	-1
i give this doll 2 stars because least she very well presented box she brought delight my 7 year old day . after 1st day , suzie no longer worked . we tried replacing batteries but no avail . we should heeded advice some other reviewers . if you want suzie her looks , great . but if you actually want doll works , consider different purchase	-1
my 6yo wanted this doll christmas , but i resisted . when she kept asking , i made deal buy it her , exchange clearing out substantial stash old toys . she her 3yo sister all work select toys donation or trash . , i am grateful . but susie doll bust . they played it day or two , then novelty wore off , she sitting corner ever since . she not particularly cute or cuddly doll . she little odd shaped , due growth ability she limited interaction	-1
our 2 1/2 year old 4 year old boys playing this vacuum over year now-it gets played every single day . it only way we vacuum because it just like mom's! forget styrofoam beads-it more noise it makes ( not too loud ) controls attachments . i am glad it not actually " work " or " suck " it completely safe kids this way . fabulous i would recommend it highly everyone	-1

this x-wing so cool !! you could turn it luke x-wing or wedge x-wing !! luke comes lightsaber ! it comes 6 minifigs ! x-wing compartment luke could store his lightsaber !! this set takes 30 or 40 minutes complete , but it worth it ! must any child !!	1

this number one short list christmas gifts my daughter produced santa . she loves it plays it everyday . construction okay , chair little flimsy . interactive feature cool but if there lot background noise ariel doesn't always hear you correctly . overall it big hit my kid !	1
my nephew enjoyed this toy , however i found balls touch bit too difficult hammer down , thus making it much louder than need . i think age group should set higher because strength needed , overall well built toy . his older brother no problems playing it	-1
our daughter received this toy gift , her arm got stuck one holes top while reaching ball it went down . she nearly broke her arm trying get it out ( luckily we supervising stepped ) . also , balls hard pound through holes since base not attached main piece , two separate constantly . this toy huge disappointment	-1
we based our purchase this toy feedback previous listed . toy appears durable my son enjoy it , but there some things forcing us reconsider our purchase . balls really need pounded them go down holes - my son can't it yet it takes my wife i above average hit . balls also got stuck en route down occasion - we haven't it month . unless you believe your child really wants this , your $20 may better spent elsewhere	-1
my twins got this toy their first birthday , they now 17 months . they like train all animals ; it just not favorite toy . they like train , but we turn moving function ( thumbs up able turn off wheels ) because my daughters kept stopping it moving away them . songs annoying , but upbeat . we all like animal sounds you get when you push bell or place animal engine . i just wish some animal sounds more identifiable which animal says what ( what animal says " chomp , chomp " ? ) . all animals except monkey comes train give satisfying clicking noises when you move arms/legs around . bottom feet/hands all different colors sometimes beads added interest . twins like play animals move their arm/legs into all sorts unnatural poses . my favorite flying giraffe . we since bought/received most rest this series toys they seem all similar . polar bear monkey set nice because they electronic animal sounds when you move head carrying cases	-1
adorable , bright , strong , big train set ! larger than i imagined . i purchaed this my new grandchild . i , myself , 3 sons who train set similar this but smaller . all 3 them loved it played it years . i'm hoping my grandchild gets much joy entertainment . this particular site offered it $5 less than fisher price site , ( i am comparison shopper ) . it arrived within 2 days !	1
my daughter , who just turned 1 , received amazing animals sing go choo-choo . my 2 1/2 year old son my daughter both enjoy this toy . it catchy song animal sounds great . we also bought zebra lion their cars . only problem wheels don't seem work well our carpet or ceramic tile . wheels tend spin not make train go anywhere most time , but both my kids still enjoy it	-1

this fun game , but play more challenging levels you build some machines ( like scale , race car , ramp)that used over over game . unfortunately , materials provided not very sturdy . dowels too big fit into some required pieces consequently , my husband broke one dowels trying force it into discs necessary build scale . then we couldn't use scale , which really disappointing because it central game . also , my ten year old found error one question cards - answer provided incorrect . said all , we still enjoy game play it alot even though we can't use scale . it very interesting , especially if your child inclination towards logic , mechanics , or physical sciences . my son loves it , because he mechanical minded ( i'm not ! ) , he gets kick out getting answers right mom gets wrong	-1
my son loves his tractor . he rides it several times day . it definitely his favorite toy	1

i copy original game before it changed after four years its present format . it simple , got job , fast-paced , cost less	-1
this version added quite few dimensions game we our house playing non-stop over year now . while original monopoly staple , we all know its subtilties ( sp ? ) , this game all flavors original added lot game . i dare say we might playing lot more it upcoming months . highly recommended , however we adjusted rules bit ; game seems unfairly make boardwalk property ( usually not great property ) single most important property . look discussion section this listing rule changes we come up fix this problem . i'd like other opinions . - jl	1

i bought mega bloks dragon mountain set myself few months ago yet put it together . only things i put together dragons . instructions putting it together well . they tell you exactly what you need each step . improvement would some views above make building process little easier . completed structure actually two separate structures joined bridge mine car . impressive this set , it holds together quite well . key build , any other mega bloks set , good hard level surface . i've moved it couple times one smaller base sections fall off , but that no big deal since there nothing underneath hold it place . it'll take two trips move it so don't move it all once . just make sure you carry larger structure holding onto floor second level take your time while moving it . one other nice improvement would addition second cannon . i love idea mounting cannon onto dragon , but it would nice either second cannon mounted smaller structure it shows instructions or even better yet , harpoon lancher . other than , i feel dragon mountain great addition mega bloks dragons series	1
i very pleased bead kit . children loved it	1
this deck not like original yugi deck . its much better . you get cards like black luster soldier , swords revealing light , much more . ( i also put my egyptain god card winged dragon ra this deck , sold game dawn destiny )	1

i don't remember age range this game , but i would recommend 10 up . i played this my daughter her friend . some wishes explained , because girls never heard some things . like , " hosting charity ball . " but over all this good game , you learn lot your friends short amount time . i think she able play it years come . really good sleep over game	-1
my nephew little over 1 year he absolutly loved this toy . it seems like it would pretty stupid , but some reason balls popping out one end rolling other really captivated them .	-1
it numerous sound feature . music tune it fairly entertaining . however , touch sensor aren't sensitive . you press it numerous times make it work . it didn't entertain my child all .	-1
my 8 year old bored 5 minutes . don't waste your money . screens hard see . volume control but reset every time it restarted . overall this game very dissapointing	-1
my daughter received this doll christmas erica two years ago both dolls still going strong . they both voice tracks which still working , they both great shape , even though their hair gowns taken beating . unfortunately after two years changing exchanging gowns , bodices now ripping apart ( they already sewn once ) . loss gowns reason rating 4 stars instead five . aside , it one nicest , if not nicest their video tie-in products .	-1

she such pretty doll , my grandaughter really loves this barbie . my grandaughter loves movie , i love it too . i believe it teaches little girls good values , it ok intelligent , use your head . all all this very good doll little girls	1
don't waste your money this pooh . my son got him christmas didn't really care anything him . i know you change songs but our pooh says happy birthday my son every day . i probably change , though . he doesn't keep time . every day he got more more off until he singing talking middle night nap time ! well , needless say , he he no longer us ! he lives garage . my husband put him out there after he woke my son up , again ! i storing him attic soon . i wouldn't recommend anyone purchase him . he says my son name really funny too . i extremely disappointed this	-1
i hear you , guys ! after choosing all my son " favorites " i finally get it just how i want **** thing keeps giving me " not connected . try again . " message ! i unplugged it , plugged it , unplugged it ... my computer ( os : xp ) doing " i'm connected something " bong-sound , but alas , nothing ! i give up , but tried usb port it worked ! :-) i too so excited this toy . how cool pooh say " ryan " sings cue ... well , almost ... he says everyting random order ( okay , i understand it toy ) pressing his hotspots won't change what he already saying ... it primative talking toy say least . who doesn't like pooh though ? he adorable . battery box sticks out little too far back , which causes hard spot , his shirt doesn't fully cover opening , so i see future problem ... i eagerly await future software updates well . it would nice if pooh would eat meat since my son favorite dinner chicken not cherry pie ! what " haycorns " anyway ? :-) go ahead , buy it . give it whirl , but keep your receipt . my son yet see it ... : -	-1
i always praised leappad products this just add it . these only things i get my 4 year old interested	1
i bought this my son he loves using these pillows when he goes bed . he loves it . thank yo	-1
avid music fan , this real cool toy play your favorite tunes . i am big audiophile , but i couldn't complain too much sound quality drum sounds . they sound pretty good considering there really isn't much competition market electronic drumsticks . if i my way i would design pair sticks simulated real " hi-hat " sound instead ride cymbal sound , i would also make hi-hat sound default sound right drumstick make ride cymbal bass drum two buttons right stick . i would also like able snare drumroll both sticks , but currently due design , you only make snare sound left stick . i would probably add button onto right stick able hit both sticks same snare sound . what would also real nice sticks adjust volume based how hard you hit sticks . lot keyboards nowadays ability it really make difference drums , especially when doing crescendo song or when drums played quietly . it takes some getting used , but i feel like i'm pro drumming these sticks . i recommend this anyone who listens music while tapping anything they find . it good practicing rhythm well really add lot your songs if you choose record your work	-1
my friend brought it over he got it christmas . he likes play drums so i . it cool . , unknow	1
we gave these our daughter christmas . she not put them down ! they sound awesome she so much fun them . her only issue when she lets someone else try them , they won't give them back ! she fourteen , loves music , dabbles our real drumset , but beauty these no one else hear them . we not tried them any other mp3 player , just her ipod , but we love them . definitely worth $30	1
my daughter 2 1/2 when she got this loved it ! my son 5 1/2 usually doesnt play his sister leap pad but loved this book .	1
our 3 year old not like this book very much . colors shapes too small . there too much other information around those items make it clear what they supposed learning . it says it supposed teach numbers , but it only goes up 5 . if i it over again i would purchased leappad book instead this one	-1
we bought this our 4 year old she loves it ! inside very soft outside her favorite disney princesses it . it great sleepovers indoors . i would not recommend this outdoor , camping sleeping bag .	-1
my son received this video his 4th birthday his aunt . after watching it over over 2 days straight , not only our son know sound every letter , but also learned create words . i only wish there video continue after this one , however , it taught my son start creating words his own , within few short months , he reading 1st grade level . he not yet 5 reading 2nd grade books little no help . definitely worth price	1
this absolutely best leapster cartridge ! it includes video putting words together my 4 year old son watches over over sings . there also many word games easy enough my son but also challenge him he learns more ! great product	1
this terrible ... first they control box wired into box it came , so we literally rip it out box get it out ... it not tell you you warm or close unless you 1-2 inches bear ... not buy !	-1
nice , cuddlely stuff toy . great toddlers . it doesn't talk - plus my book	1
pretty boring . body squishy rubbery any lint , fuzz or dog hair sticks it . only few different ways position him little accessories . after few minutes , kids . lie down because it won't stand up . we gave it away because my kids didn't play it wanted somebody else it . they friend who always took it off our shelf when he came over play so we sent him home it .	-1
i am glad this birthday gift not something i spend my own money . spongebob collects alot dirt quickly pieces not stay very well . far obscene gesture ... i understand why some people may turned off it . my 2 year old who loves spongebob pays no attention it	-1
puzzle needs cardboard backing insert pieces . pieces warped they not stay together . this puzzle very difficult put together out backing	-1
i disagree review says this puzzle not good little kids . i daughter who just turned 4 couple weeks ago also autistic . she loves this puzzle learned how use box cover properly place states . i am glad they individual shapes states . it not jigsaw puzzle . it teaches kids where states located terrific little ones older ones . even i good time this .	1
i bought this puzzle my father who alzheimer disease . he now living care facility where caregivers work keep residents alert engaged activities . some residents don't track well enough even this level puzzle but dad several others enjoy it greatly . today 4 residents ( including dad ) i worked puzzle they thrilled successful placing states where they belonged . while doing puzzle each participant would add bits their personal history when state name familiar them . once puzzle complete each participant stated ( located ) state which they born ... state where they attended university ... other states they'd lived or visited . get this level interaction required my assistance but they all great time ! plus next time we puzzle most them forgotten they've already this so experience success using it all over again . ( family members ad victims look small victories . ) i'm going take them solar system one next	1
my 1 year old given this his birthday . some phrases rude . songs sung off key . rollers don't always play special song when there 3 kind lined up . car sounds enough make me batty . i don't see where it teaching child anything since it might say any one three things each picture . it number ? it shape ? maybe this time it going animal . low volume setting still too loud . only reason i've given it 2 stars instead 1 because my son likes this toy despite fact loses interest after few minutes ..	-1
first glance it seemed perfect gift baby thing all things wheels musical . normally i really trust vtech name - so i didn't look item too closely prior buying it . but it didn't take long me realize what mistake i made . yes , he likes it very much uses it well , it performs well etc . however , i agree there nothing nice how voices speak or what they say - i would never think i would such ' prudish ' view baby toy ! but it rude , it obnoxious i don't like message - if you say there one - i mean - they could much more endearing snippets . there little education it really - songs short lyrics abc song half cut out ?!?!? i could without education toy - but coupled bad attitude - i one thing say " outta ' my house " older version this toy much better friendlier voices helpful ' neighbors ' . vtech should go back old version	-1
this great toy . it comes r2-d2 , luke yoda . it comes yodas house . lukes x-wing fighter awsome .	1

i bought this my niece she absolutely loves it ! she play it over over , since it doesn't stick surfaces . if colors all get mixed together it like big ball candy sprinkles . looks very pretty , instead looking like some ugly mess you get play dough or other playing compounds . she wanted floam , but gooey sticky mess so her mom said no . i found this it even better ! it kind reminds me rice crispy treats , how marshmallows kind string away you break them into pieces , only not so sticky . if you considering this your child , they love it ! not recommended little ones , my daughter 2 she just wants eat it	1
this fun kids , although they tired it quickly . no bad scent , sticks pretty good - stays together enough hold shape , although i wish it bit stickier . not messy	-1
this given my daughter third grade , first she intimidated questions . it starts out challenging you easy questions , but they get harder , i see her try harder too . it gives you several answers choose , praises you when you pick right one . it gets harder harder , but kids seem love it . it great long car rides , isn't very loud annoying . shut off switch save battery life . very fun toy , extremely educational ! i even bought one teaches addition my first grader	1
my 8 year old found it rather boring , even after i showed her faster games . she only used it three times , it sits closet . she loves all other leapfrog , but found this drab . i would get one others more than just multiplication	-1
this horse named paciica . she dark peachish color skin brown muzzle brown stockings . she comes 20 red beads , 10 shell beads , 10 rubber stoppers keep beads falling out . her saddle bag pinkish reddish color . it makes great space store beads holds rolled up beach towel green orange flowers . saddle blanket light , washed-out yellow different orange flowers than saddle bag beach towel . saddle red-brown some silver dark brown parts white seat . her stable see through beach scene back , drawn hay stable floor . stable small enough top fit under most beds . if you get this horse you should satisfied , you get your money worth . i recommend cali girl horseback riding barbie go this because she items horse , because she fits perfectly ontop pacifica . thank you reading my review	1
my daughter wanted easy-bake oven this great alternative . they learn make cupcakes frosting scratch , no pre-mixed stuff here . recipes makes 18-24 minicupcakes , nice small snack ! they are-super stuffed cupcakes-peanut butter cup-cakes-colorful cupcake boguet-cream-filled cupcakeit great them learn fractions(cups ) measure tea/tablespoons . addition , we lots fun decorating them frosting	1
it too bad previous reviewer such negative experience . these work great us ! maybe clean windows our new mini-van factor successful installation ? pros : 1 ) setup super quick . i even able peel reapply order reposition/straighten shade . shades never fallen off or started peeling edges , though we've only them up maybe 4+ months . 2 ) fabulous keeping out sunlight , better than roller shades suction windows because it actually shades or dims light rather than diffusing brightness through tiny holes like suction kind . 3 ) since they're static clings , we put up 2 shades side-by-side our mini-van not any gaps like we when we 2 suction roller shades next each other . 4 ) we actually roll down window these , without wrinkling shade ( or worrying suction cups popping off . btw , one our suction shades won't even stick window anymore ) . but we don't really roll down those windows , anyway , so i can't speak its durability after frequent opening/closing . cons : 1 ) only think one ; it quite effective keeping out light , it bit dark see out , particularly night , ( or gray , rainy days ) mini-van , i need extra careful checking my blindspot . ( thus , 4 stars ) . ** edit/update ** after such great experience first set , we purchased set back january . however , they didn't seem much " cling " , didn't last 12 hours before they fell right off . suspected , it turns out cold chicago weather culprit ! after waiting weather warm up , i'm happy report success ! my husband cleaned windows ( just precaution ) , able re-install shades despite fact they practically crumpled floor our mini-van number weeks before we rolled them up again store remainder winter . lesson : don't install these dead chicago winter ! btw , we've never any problems first set , even throughout winter ( they installed aug/sept ) . this second set looking pretty good so far ( it month ) . if anything changes , i'll update	-1
i enjoy this set because i feel it much different than anything lego ever put into . i like how they fused technic peices , regular legos . i wish they put more detail inside	1
my 10 yr old daughter her friends blast this game . tho , sometimes , there should reward knowing answer without using choices . sometimes they get it lucky guess .	-1
i love playing trivial pursuit junior . questions made kids , so just going school 7 years i figure out many answers . i don't reccommend getting this kids different ages play together , though , because older person almost always wins . like other people said , once you play game 10 times you end up memorizing most answers , it would much appreciated if trivial pursit made booster pack cards . only other bad thing game cardboard wedges get bent handling them	-1
game christmas gift . it shipped right schedule arrived a1 condition . you couldn't ask better service	1
only thing my daughter really liked microphone . rest it just sits there . it doesn't really anything i would not recommend this anyone else . if i it again , i would just bought her sing-a-long microphone .	-1
my children , ages 3 , 4 , 10 , loved playing these puzzles our pediatrician office so much , it difficult get them leave . when we found this set amazon.com, we purchased them immediately . each puzzle comes plastic tray , full-size black white photo outlines each shape , one-piece foam frame outside edges . smaller children put puzzle together right over top black white photo , making puzzles simple enough toddlers assemble their own . older children put puzzles together without using photo backdrop , making puzzles little more challenging they grow .	1
cool ! i bought 5 magician force packs last week i got some really good ones ! i got 3 ultra rares , 1 super rare 1 crappy rare . these ultra rares : luster dragon ( mfc-058 ) , chaos command magician , xyz-dragon cannon . super rare i got z-metal tank , crappy rare ante . you gotta get this set	1
adorable item . my son loves this . it our special teddy bear we use only night . morning he tells me " put it away " until nap time or bed time . very soft . after my son stayed my sister house , her son wants one now too ! after i bought this , i realized you purchase wand it turn light show location . i wish i would known before . yes , others said , battery pack bit hard . it adorable . i just bought this month or so ago , price almost doubled . i don't know if i would purchased it this price - it much better	-1
our 3 year old loves this bear . she carries it around it reassures her night . it so bright she carry it when power goes out gives off reassuring sphere light around her . i didn't give it 5 stars because it battery pack back kind hard . it would gotten 5 stars if they better job cushioning this apparatus	-1
my son loves his glo bear . he 3 just started some trouble getting sleep , strangly enough not due afraid dark . but still this bear trick . 5 different lights fading slowly into one just seemed relax him into sleep . i'll getting my niece who afraid dark this great little friend .	1
i want this my nicece nphew i could play i	1
my daughter received this gift when she turned five . not buy this game unless you willing spend hour putting it together figuring out how play it . while you're doing , your child(ren ) whining it taking so long . i doing okay until it came time put two stickers spinning wheel . directions this part incredibly confusing , directions how play game same . i also couldn't believe i put stickers die ( first time everything ! ) . said , once we finally figured it all out , my daughter loves it . i think it " secret " aspect game she enjoys -- pick three things out box without peeking look your match your princess w/o showing anyone else card win game . still , i rate this 2 stars poor construction game	-1
i received this game present my wife . however , after few games , one buttons stopped responding , making game difficult play . it returned amazon exchange . one note game , make-it-you-take-it style 24 seconds odd , but addition 3-point shot awesome ! game good i remember especially pro2 . when quiet time necessary , sound on/off terrific . i gave it four stars because durability seems weak ( fifteen minutes christmas morning action results bad button ) instructions written poorly . just followup , amazon shipped me new game even before i chance send defective one back . kudos amazon customer service staff job well ! i'd give game five stars , but cannot seem figure out how change rating	-1
i 7 month old he really enjoys playing this toy . it great babies just mastering sitting everything they need enjoy themselves within reach ! sound effects easy parent ears , too :) this purchase well worth it !	1
my kids i absolutely love this product -- obviously , careful re pieces if you small kids household , but it wonderfully addictive play	1
i just wanted share everyone this one best educational toys you purchase little one . i got this my son cameron last year christmas . we just love this toy . he play alone . he listen watch story tv or after listening story he go back it ask him story line certain page or asks him objects he pick correct answer ... very entertaining . i am hoping they come out more stories besides first 8 introduced . i am surprised this toy reduced sale . i think they need remarket product more stories offer future long it still works this original player . this great toy buy child loves stories or reading . a++++++++++++++++++++++++	1
read me dvd wonderful tool add list many items help children learn love reading . programming remote not too difficult . my son got this christmas when he almost 3 ( january birthday ) we waited program it until he taking nap so he not frustrated while trying set it up . it only took 10-20 minutes program , but i would still recommend waiting until child asleep or busy . my son figured out how work it very quickly first it more reading comprehension . questions story children select correct answer . we also got him couple other stories like green eggs ham little engine could ( we now all but one story ) . although words highlighted quickly , they same pace if you reading story , he still able pick up many words . my son fascinated words within few weeks using this he able read book green eggs ham himself . we thought he memorized it , but he actually corrected mistakes knew words if i pointed them individually . he now 3 years 5 months dvd system 6 months now reading level 1 or 2 ( my first reader books ) reading same level his 5 year old sister . he loves play his " video game " i say i am happy let him play it . recently he even started asking words when watching movie ( closed caption subtitles ) he watching movie he listen point words bottom screen . i would recommend this toy anyone children 3 up . again it just one tool should used help child learn read , comprehend what they reading begin enjoy reading . it not itself necessarily going teach child read but used other items help . i would recommend you buy actual books go dvd , we already most them but way they story read them slower , or able work learning words parent help . my son always takes his books bed him reads using light his nightlight . learning how sound out words basic reading concepts check out website starfall.com it wonderful tool .	1
i purchased this top my granddaughter , who 2 , christmas . she brother who 5-1/2 cousin who 6 . they all loved it played it most day . only drawback , told me my daughter , it sounds bit like train while it spinning , which i am sure kids love , but after while got adults nerves they turn kids attention other toys . other than , i would given it 5 stars . my grandchildren love it , course now it now christmas day , they don't play it constantly , so train noise not such issue	-1

there only one problem like someone else said , jewelry box hard open !! it hard me open times , my 4 year old daughter never able open it . we got it her part her christmas . other than , she loves it . it plays bippity boppity boo .	-1
my daughter loves this lil ' quad . however i don't think age range correct it ( 1-3 ) . i don't see how 1 year old could ride this . my daughter 2 yrs old she really enjoys riding this around house . great thing it it very small so it no problem it house rather than only use it out side . what i like most it . i am happy purchase !	1
i brought this last christmas my daughter , i also recommended co-worker mine same since her daughter also two years old . two days after christmas two front wheels fell off while she riding it they continued fall off every time she would drive off sidewalk into grassy area or bush . there plastic round piece holds two wheels place , but this piece doesn't fit properly prevent wheels coming off . two weeks later i went visit my co-worker home she experiencing same problem . i got so sick tired putting wheels back while my daughter outdoors riding it i don't let her ride it anymore . not worth money or time ! buy dora explorer big wheel instead , my daughter loves it it very durable	-1

i bought these my music lover when he 4 years old . he loved them so much he wanted take them preschool share his friends . his teacher loved them so much she wanted order some class . kids blast playing them all morning . my boys now nearly 6 3 these always guaranteed fun when we play them . i really like how each person hold tube you whack them floor play songs together . yeah , they plastic tube , but they fun plastic tube teaches them music entertains them	-1

i played this game my kids it way fun . game set up red blue " teams " but it just two people ... answers not obscure i thought they would but varied enough fun child or grown up . i even got one gift my friend who total music buff	-1
this game lot fun . , most impressive thing me everyone get involved enjoy it . it challenging enough music lovers , but simple enough casual music fans . battle bands portion probably most fun got everyone involved . everyone given one topic ... like ' bands start letter . ' then , you go back forth naming bands until one team can't think any more . it good fun money .	-1
i played this game my 13 year old daughter my wife friend . this wonderful addition our boardgame collection . it really game pursuit - reminiscent packman way . great fun chasing everyone around trying escape traps you've set others - gotten caught yourself . easy learn great fun . perfect adults , entire family	1
twice played catch 22 friend house during this past week , i happily say it not strategy game dull , two-years-to-learn-the rules way . it fun . blurb back box describes premise - accurately my opinion - " take money run " . board you're moving around labyrinth-like , token-filled jackpots seemingly positioned every corner . what called `blocker cubes ' effect empowering players ( not mention they fun hold ! ) , they provide real twist play - these devices used players trap/thwart each other . when we played , we avoided temptation using quarters other forms ' real money ' substitutes play tokens ( largely because there children playing us ) , although i easily see why others might not able resist . i also appreciate , unlike most other games i've played this genre , which only designed two players , this game played up 6 people ( our first game involved 4 players , second involved 6 ) . last but not least , you're always using your brain figure out your next move . this gets my recommendation	1
my 6 year old boy obsessed baseball this item perfect him . he absolutely loves it plays it all time . it great toy . only complaint i things you secure it top door little flimsy but it comes velcro added stability . velcro , it very secure not moved . i highly reccommend this toy .	1

this additional set lil kingdom . it includes pink carriage , princess sonya lee , prince michael horse either connected carriage or horse ridden all itself . also included dance area so your little people dance spin morning away ! i've said it before i'll say it again , imagination play so important your child ! any little people set or additional set create hours fun both you your child !	1
my daughter recieved camera gift when she 3 . we only replace batteries once two years regular play . she lost interest it age 5 when novelty using " grownup " digital camera supervision won out over fun sound effects red led flash smile camera . it still looked like new after time , so we happily passed it younger relative	-1

i thought this very cute my daughter loved playing it . then , when she her carseat she threw up , which very unusual her . then i figured out what happened : right after , i noticed she sticking keys all way into her throat . i'm sure she gagged it why she threw up . i now let her play it little , but only if i am watching her closely make sure she doesn't . i wouldn't recommend it .	-1
my dad just loves his new birthday present . we up visiting him over holidays i saw him use his game every day without fail . good job amazon	1
really fun pastime , well presented all sorts concessions people who excellent this sort thing people who need lots help	-1

owoooooooo ! who i see walkin ' these woods ? why , it little red riding hood . hey there little red riding hood , you sure looking good . you're everything big bad wolf could want . listen me . little red riding hood i don't think little big girls should go walking these spooky old woods alone . owoooooooo ! okay , so there not specific nursery rhyme little red riding hood way there peter peter pumpkin eater or little miss muffett , but one look mcfarlane toy twisted fairy tales version fairy tale figure song sam sham pharaohs going through your head well . i think this best looking figure set . ivory white her skin contrasts nicely deep crimson black her outfit , there some nice silver trim cape , accents all silver spikes snaps her outfit . so we pretty much talking little red riding hood mistress bondage or something alone those lines ( which certainly fits requirement twisted ) . i just think mask unnecessary touch . meanwhile , song still going through my brain . what big eyes you , kind eyes drive wolves mad . so just see you don't get chased i think i ought walk you ways . what full lips you . they're sure lure someone bad . so until you get grandma place i think you ought walk me safe . i'm gonna keep my sheep suit until i'm sure you've shown i trusted walking you alone . owoooooooo ! red comes long knife , which fits into her right hand , sliced diced wolf sitting pool blood base . red stands alone without base , but clear intent here you position her so while she continue her assault wolf knife her right hand she use her left so it looks like she holding up wolf continue fun ( my , my , how much inside stomach wolf ) . accordingly figure offers limited articulation : her neck ( although limited hood ) , left shoulder , right bicep , both thighs . you only going find couple poses which she looks good , so sure scope out results various angles before you decide what you want go here . plus you play song while you pose figure same way i am playing it over over again while writing this review . little red riding hood i'd like hold you if i could but you might think i'm big bad wolf so i won't . owoooooooo ! what big heart i have-the better love you . little red riding hood even bad wolves good . i'll try satisfied just walk close your side . maybe you'll see things my way before we get grandma place . story little red riding hood remains one best examples explainig such characters narratives terms their archetypal significance . symbolism woods apparent all , especially when red make her journey into it , which makes it easier explain wolf archetypal embodiment wild . once upon time wolves sacred animals , but now they demonized society trying clean up its brutal past . now wolf identified trickster , well obvious metaphor sexually predatory men , which makes his eviseration symbolic something else well ( but let us not go there ) , so this figure might appeal some customers level well . fourth series mcfarlane monsters , twisted fairy tales menagerie consists not only little red riding hood but also peter peter pumpkin eater , little miss muffett , humpty dumpty , famous tage team hansel gretel ( sold separately ) . given origins most classic fairy tales providing twisted versions not really off point , although these figures certainly takes twisted next level . even if you not want entire set , there should one these figures captures jungian dark side tales we all raised once upon time most appeals you . little red riding hood you sure looking good you're everything big bad wolf could want . owoooooooo ! i mean baaaaaa ! baaa ?	-1

my son came home his first week kindergarten speaking this great timer his teacher -- if timer went off , snack time over . period . he seemed so intrigued i decided i needed get one . it awesome - least my two boys ( ages 3 5 ) . i give them 20 minutes get out bed dressed morning 20 eat breakfast . timer shows green , then turns yellow when time almost up ; then turns red . you customize sound effects each color ; amount time allow during each color . my kids responded fabulously timer -- we always time school . i also use it sharing timer ( if they fight over toy , i set timer they take turns ); use it play-time ( you x# minutes play before dinner , bedtime , etc . )	1
time tracker good , once you know how program it . you program standard setting , say you always give child 15 minutes play , you set 12 minutes green three minutes yellow then red . you sounds each segment or slience . if you change times frequently , you either frustrated set it every time , or become really good doing it without instructions .	-1
we got this our 3 year old 5 year old love it . there two different levels play- one shapes without ( so you place shapes your own make larger shape ) . both boys feel challenged enjoy both levels . i think level 2 work much older children because even i work through figuring out shapes spatially . also , shapes magnetic , so great toy road ! all all , highly recommended educational toy many ages- we haven't gotten adult version tangoes yet , but plan	1
out block sets , this one my son loves best . he fifteen months loves jingle bell rattle some other blocks . young child , sound probably most amusing sense	1
i adore this mini changer ! i don't lug baby , diaper bag my purse . now i focus more my daughter ! i wish it shoulder strap , but wrist strap works fine	1
i it it lated awile(1-2months)enough last till it wouldn't open ! other things happened i didn't like don't get it pease it waste !!!	-1
this product much messier than they show tv . it not mixed up well when you get it then goo sticks everything !! my kids mix mix work stuff together , then they didn't want play it anymore . real flop	-1
i bought this my son 2nd birthday he loves it ! i classic radio flyer when i little , so i'm starting tradition ! every kid should red wagon growing up . this one especially great because wheels all-terrain ... great everywhere	1
our kids love this wagon ! they pull each other around yard it next impossible tip over , dog even pull it her harness not tip it over ! it held up very well , we've it 5 years it still holding strong ! only sign wear it got scratch paint ( my husband fault ) it rusted just touch there , we planning fixing few weeks make it look new ! it also works great yard work ! my son loves using it help him his job picking up sticks yard , he piles them high finishes his job half time	-1
this game so much fun ! you learn so much people playing . sure play people you trust honest their views	1
my son swept away description this game he found mail-order catalog . playing it less enchanting . game goes , those who not winning not particularly good time . although dread pirate extremely beautifully made , it not favorite . we've amazing amount fun better games , such zendo chrononauts , playing game after game . there certainly much worse games out there than dread pirate , but there also few tremendously better . buy this game if you more interested quality feel game pieces than how much fun rules	1
great price quick delivery . it great game all ages play together . fast moving fun	1
we so much fun this game . you many people you want play everyone stays playing until you winner . whole crowd gets involved . i would love find other games much fun this one	1
after getting both star scream rodimus , seeing others shelves , i'd ahve say rodimus second most accurate his cartoon form . his cor form dead accurate teh cartoons , one issue i avhe this toy si head could larger teh robot mode wella sthe fact his chest seems higher up than his head , wich detracts his accuracy . other head , toy both modes very well detailed articulate . i never owned teh original hod rod or rodimus prime toys so i can't really compare his transforming those lines , but general rule his bit complicated change i would definitely not recomend him 5 year olds , maybe 7 or 8 eyar olds but i think hasbro shot low this line because i ehar some fot eh others bit easy change more like " shell-formers " tahn good ol ' transformers :p , peeve i this hasbro opted use name rodimus instead hot rod , he wasnt calle3d rodimus until he become teh new autobot leader end movie when he took full name rodimus prime , but i ' am not rating toy it' name , this jsut tiny thing i supsoe doesnt matter much given technically both names used him .	-1
original transformers movie released again few weeks brand new movie follow , new old fans alike delighting seeing some cool new transformers action figures store shelves just time christmas . hasbro wrapping up cybertron toy line needed some new figures release until next july when new movie premieres . their answer create line called " transformers classics " which features exciting new molds many classic transformers characters first appeared 1980 . i know lot us who grew up collected toys those characters pretty excited see them reappear store shelves . it great chance us relive our memories also share them children now our lives . said , meet rodimus . he gone many names over years , including hot rod , rodimus prime rodimus major , even similar character loosely based him energon toy line , but whatever you want call him , he one more well known figures transformers lore . old school transformers fan like myself quickly tell this figure based off original 1986 toy which known " hot rod " . course , hasbro no longer name " hot rod " copyrighted so rodimus next best thing . i always like hot rod/rodimus character because i saw lot myself him . he young bold bit reckless times , but deep down all he wanted chance prove himself . i think lot us indentify . this toy , it obviously takes lot its design original , especially futuristic car form . there few differences but not lot . robot form also somewhat similar original , but little more streamlined . one cool addition this toy missile launcher which actually fire missile both car robot mode . car mode , launcher doubles tailpipe , giving new meaning term " backfiring " . far difficulty transformation , it actually rather easy compared many transformers . instructions they give you aren't best , but once you change him back forth once or twice , you'll see he actually much easier transform than majority cybertron figures also classic transformers . i would definitely vouch this toy few levels . $9.99 isn't bad price all , especially when you consider find original any kimd decent shape would cost you least 3 times much . there re-issued version original but it too become rare again , near impossible find under $30 . this toy also quite fun . i mean , who wouldn't want drive futuristic red race car orange flames hood ? course , us " old timers " , there massive sentimental value well . my advice pick this up while you i fully expect them fly off shelves .	1
go figure . i picked this head because it seemed significant size , lot silky-looking hair , real lashes , fun ( rather than tacky ) features make-up fairy rather than teen . however , her hair very fine actually glued together parts retain her curls . it painful watch my three year old twins struggle get included brush through her hair . impossible . i tried give it once-over help them out , but it tears ends up looking frizzy uneven -- i re-trim bottom . head also tips over easily when you try working her hair . ridiculous waste money	-1
i resisted buying these because they seemed so cheap ... also usual question we parents always ask ourselves ... " what they going them ? " my son received his first bionicle friend his ninth birthday ... it cleverly " bow " birthday present . i now regret overlooking this wonderful line " lego " so long ! my boys love these ! they best time building them even better time playing them . they priced reasonably so you always pick-up one treat during trips out " shopping " . if you encourage your children " save-up " some their " wants " , cost these low enough it doesn't take them months months realize their goal . please not make same mistake i made misjudge these toys . you denying your child great experience . although manufacturer suggests ages 7 up , i not feel child younger than 8 or 9 would able independently put this toy together . my 7 year old needs some help putting these together , but he loves try all himself . point lego , construct play . primary benefit , my opinion , satisfaction " doing it " yourself ! definate a+ our boys ! rosemary	1
toa iruini awesome . i got it earlier comic-con . rhotuka launcher , you take off get better grip . reason they're only two coming out because if all them came out , it would too far past . i truly reccomend this set	1

" customers who bought this item also bought ... " . that bit easily overlooked when one orders item . once toy arrives you surprised know number accessories also needed . it takes lot time finding some , lot more creative thinking others ( gravel ! ) . then this compound starts getting highly educational you teach child handle his/her birthday present way nurse would normally deal patients under intensive care . whole thing little disappointing overall . actual comment this item nothing les than " this package sure nice " . maybe idea interesting , but offer more headaches than fun your family	-1
my 6-year old son received videonow xp his 6th birthday my sister . she also bought him scooby doo interactive movie . he enjoys movie , but gets frustrated getting past each point . overall he enjoys his new toy . my frustration , however , i looked online more videos , it shows them , but says they currently unavailable . i seen past few weeks . target very limited number pvd most i don't feel appropriate my six year old ie , older kid shows . i would like see more educational interactive movies , because after getting through scooby show , i think my son become bored it ..............	-1

this fun accessory basic geo trax system . tower chimes plays music when light sensors triggered moving train . young engineers like how sturdy how easily tracks assembled . just one warning ; it wise also get raised track so 2nd level tower used ground level track	1
our 2 4 year old boys love this tower . it chimes when trains pass under it ( there light sensor points down onto track ) . my 2 year old especially loves he rotate picture wheel it plays songs . this held up remarkably well since we got it christmas . many little hands pushed top button turned picture wheel . it also dropped knocked over million times ( boys ! ) . our windmill broke within few minutes rough boy play crane didn't hold their interest . it chime clock tower saw mill constantly played	1
i purchased this doll my son he absolutely loved . he plays it everyday so me it worth every penny ! great toddlers young ones heart	-1
we bought this our 1-year-old daughter , although she can't all activities , she loves try ! this one her favorite toys her crib , she playing 1 out 2 mornings when i go her room get her up morning . one review said you make this your own . i agree , extent . i * could * make this , but time i gotten everything look nice high quality , i would spent hours hours lot more money materials than just buying it . my daughter loves it , i am extremely pleased it	1
this not what we thought it would all . it very difficult small people use . i would look into book money	1
set very small pins so small they not even stand up their own . it cheaply made , choose bowling set	-1
i bought this my mentally challenged brother after playing it friends house . it great keeping your arithmetic skills honed . it just plain fun you adapt game meet users needs . my brother throws dice then puts appropriate key or keys down . he doesn't keep score but it kept him occupied using his counting skills . we heard box shutting all christmas day	1
great lego toy . we bought this set go lego city train deluxe set we purchased earlier 2006 . only draw back amount tracks included city train starter set . it only enough create oval . i recommend buying additional tracks increase joy playing this wonderful toy	1
this toy fun not difficult build seven-year-old i bought it .	1
this action-figure unlike most others . normally when you open box , you get molded guy who karate kick pressing button not much else . such not case here-like all lego sets , this little beauty comes peices ( warning , choking hazard here little kids)that you must construct together form you figure . construction not difficult , but it enrapture kids least few minutes if they experts lego , probably lot longer if it their first experience building . they practice however , following instructions seeing where things could go form new parts become second nature , thus giving this figure high educational value . real beauty you also ignore instructions your own thing , combining its parts other sets form new creatures . however careful storing your spare parts case you want reconstruct original figure again . this piraka when constructed cool zamor launcher fling small marbles over several feet ... but they easily lost , so careful where you this . overall this great toy , if you or your child fan mythos they surely enjoy it .	-1
intex baby float bright yellow inflatable pool float weighs around pound half . one front part float , there logo says pool school : step 1 ( pink ) , step 2 ( blue ) . step 3 ( aqua ) . this particular float step 1 , meaning more learning float infants toddlers . back side float ( behind head rest ) words baby boat float step 1 appear . little yellow head rest inner part float , making it little more comfortable . instead normal round shape so many floats , this float square shaped two different air chambers . first air chamber outer region float . second chamber if inner seat region . inner/seat region float designed " diaper style " , making it easier those wearing little swimmer diapers fit easily . there 5 different leg holes fit little ones into , seating made thin but sturdy vinyl . there 25 pound weight limit float , should not used babies/toddlers exceed recommended weight . assembly baby float simple . mentioned before , there two different air chambers ( one outer float one inner float ) . after finding each valve , open it up inflate float . hand pump not really necessary this float only takes few minutes inflate mouth . after inflated , push valves into place float ready used . experiences intex deluxe baby pool school step 1 i clearly remember how easy it use this float . my daughter chubby little baby , so most other infants floats didn't really fit her . ease , we slipped her into intex float . while float water , she seemed attracted bright yellow colors tapped patted float lot . float worked fine no leaks plenty room lift her out . we used this float entire summer never once any problems it . there also repair patch kit comes float just case hole or leak . however , we never use it even once . float remained sturdy kept its bright color despite many many hours out sun pool . there few things this float i thought could improved upon . although my daughter loved bright yellow color , i thought there could something extra added keep her attention . we've owned floats before little toys attached front where babies could play them while swimming . this float offers no kind attached toy . also , there not handles side parents hold , or even babies . once again , there other floats built arm handles . this made it much easier get grip float while pool . it wasn't difficult keep grasp this float , but it sure would made it lot easier . recommended ? considering trying times we just finding float would " fit " , i would recommend this all chubby babies . also , fact material sturdy we never one leak reason i would recommend this float . i seen better floats out there little extras make floating bit funner , but this one i felt completely safe . if emergency happen , getting my daughter out quickly would not problem . so if you without little extras couple other trivial things , then this great little learner float .	1

near-perfect translation nhl ' 95 , not-so great port madden ' 95 . i'd originally heard fifa ' 95 ( soccer ) supposed here too , but i guess it never made it final product ... i got this last night - hockey some ommisions original ( like players names - here you only get jersey numbers ; i assume there problem licensing , possibly related current nhl lockout ?! ) , but otherwise still same great game , ton fun play . football , however , barely playable . you barely read plays , there hardly any sound ( no crowd noise , poor ' maddenisms ' ) , even music title screen isn't classic music - it just re-used hockey music . design / implementation-wise , i thought they could've made it so you could daisy-chain controllers together , but no - single player version this completely separate product - if you want play two player you buy two-controller version - you can't add later date . this unfortunate because these games ( original genesis versions ) supported 4 players , which course ups fun factor lot , but isn't possible they way jakks decided put it together . i continue love this product hockey game , but i won't even look football game again . if you're old-school fan nhl'95 , then this worth cash , but i just wish they could left out football enhanced hockey ( like putting players names - it hard remember who who back ' 95 ! ) .	1
it ordered my 13 mo old niece christmas ... it ordered tuesday here friday	1

" us , only down side this organizer it rather large bulky . it not problem home , but my daughter loves bring her leappad car her when we're go . we end up taking leappad couple books+cartridges throwing them bookbag " in-the-car " use . especially her young , it makes it easier her get them out takes up less space back seat way . i am , however , still very satisfied organizer at-home use	-1

karaoke machine i bought not " offensive " songs mentioned other reviews . we find songs tape fun my daughter hears them radio anyway . there ymca , funkeytown , hillary duff , skater boy . this good music children . plus if parents find songs offensive i think you right put tapes you want your children listen hid or dispose ones it came . i bought this machine her more educational tapes . those tapes just added bonus . there not very many tape recorders out there choose i found christmas time . so we bought this one . my daughter 4 i find age range bit high . she understands how use it thought it easy use 4 year old . sound definately " mono " i bit worried wire canerous one review said , but all wires . even my curling iron said . overall i am glad i bought this my daughter , she loves it	1
i recently bought this toy my daughter , who , way , age range listed toy ( 8-12 ) she loves it . i didn't find anything offensive songs she already hearing radio almost daily basis . i explained my children it not appropriate speak way people , i've never problem . my 5 year old even knows difference songs conversation . when two them play together , they listen music appropriate both . i think its very cute toy fun everyone when proper parenting used	1
i read other reviews before purchasing this product ( thank goodness ! ) decided i would just remove tapes considered offensive . out curiousity , though , my husband i played them after my 4 2 yr . olds gone sleep . i am utterly blown away someone approved this ! i'm assuming only adults reading these reviews i can't held responsible quoting lyrics included this product , but i think everyone should aware just how offensive these songs . one song all how teenage boy doesn't want date girl he singing , stacy , but instead her " mom got it going " he saw mom just towel when he mowing lawn could tell she hot him well way she standing ... i not want my 4 yr old singing those lyrics . but even more mind-boggling outkast song followed -- guy kept telling his girl " give him some sugar " " shake it like polaroid picture " then said " i don't wannna meet your daddy , i just want you my caddy , i don't wanna meet your mama ( said " mumma " ) , i just want see you cum-a . " oh my gosh ! you can't believe my husband face upon hearing this child toy !!! i'm disgusted would encourage everyone call complain this ! if i hadn't read reviews , my daughter would singing ! someone needs lose his or her job over this	-1

this great step up . smile . you tell graphics how much faster game progresses , it intended older kids . very educational game content . my only complaint lack games company released . highly recommeded , all games released great	1
we bought this system ( three game cartridges ) our 6 1/2 8 year old sons after doing much research . we would preferred purchase leap frog product ( our sons each own leapster all leapster cartridges ) but we disappointed leap frog didn't offer anything comparable this age group . we couldn't find many online consumer reviews vfalsh system so we counting vtech reputation . my husband i " tested " system before christmas just make sure it would work our 13 year old television ( we plug it into our vcr work ) check out quality system . our 8 yar old wanted game boy christmas again this year ( fourth year row ) we knew we could get vflash system same cost . past three years , we able keep him entertained leap frog leapster system ( which we described " educational game boy " ) but this year , we move away leap frog because he already all leapster game cartridges there no new games his age group . we bought vflash system because it educational features . both our sons absolutely love vflash so we ! i think they low expectations because it educational system but once they got into each games ( scooby doo , spiderman sponge bob ) , they kept saying " mom , this fun ! " they even like jumping bean game , which gotten so-so reviews . thing i really like system they play together non-competive way . vflash system determines whose turn it ( player 1 or player 2 ) corresponding controller becomes active/inactive so there no arguing boys over whose turn it or one " played " other turn . way games structured , it advantageous players help each other because scores cumulative based each player contribution overall score . this system win-win both children parents ! i am already planning buy " incredibles " " cars " game cartridges when they released early 2007 .	1

cage well made . wooden balls nice . however , i re-write numbers balls because printed numbers too hard read . there nice cardboard all numbers holes , so you put balls called easily . i am not happy cards . numbers meant punched out , so you only use cards once . so i use cards cheap set their markers use them more than one time	-1
i couldnt find lead time until it too late . i got tubes after i needed them . i tried email true value customer service , since there wasn't number amazon said they couldn't really help . i haven't used tubes yet , but don't want pay shipping/restocking fees . so overall , i am sure product fine , service terrible !!	-1

this not toy my son awestruck , but rainy days or very cold days , this get it use . i think more indoorsy type kid , this toy ideal , but my son enjoys more outdoor activities , this toy doesn't suit outdoors play much . towing aspects mostly looks not actual towing , it keeps disconnecting frustrates my son[and myself well ]	-1
this toy everything - my opinion ! not only it truck ( which all boys seem love ) but it dinosaurs what my son calls army guys ( but they much better than little plastic unicolored ones some his friends play - more like tiny rescue heros ! ) it building toy too !!!!!!! pieces all mix match other megarig vehicles ! my mom bought this toy my son ( who now 6 ) last year it def . gets played most any his toys ( way more than little plastic dinosaurs ! ) - i didn't think much it when she gave it him , but .... now we looking rest vehicles ! we love oppenhiemer toy award toys this should def . their list	1
my son loves school busses , so i thought he would love this . it good quality , but he isn't interested cards come it , he just wants draw , there isn't any place pen this one .	-1
i thought this would great my 2-year-old . it would teach him letters eventually able draw letters . then he received it christmas ... it cute concept , but i so frustrated educational aspect toy . there feature it ask you draw letter then push button . it doesn't matter if you draw letter right or even all . it gives " hooray " either way . that not educational . how kid going know if they're doing it wrong aside us telling them so . if you're buying it educational aspect , i'd say save your money	1
my son 4 1/2 absolutely loves this . it great learning letters numbers . it very durable . it even thrown few times still works . i would definitely recommend this toy	1

i purchased dvd remote my 7 yo daughter today . remote programmed using your dvd remote . this should 5 second process but took good five minutes it finally program . once it finally programmed we tried playing games dvd . first we went fairytopia , using remote . no problem . then we cross wall bubbles . remote completely ineffective . we even tried using dvd remote , it also ineffective . so , it impossible go fairytopia gameland under mini game selection . then we tried bibble dancing game . yeah , remote works alright .... but response remote so highly unpredictable . it might work or it might not . barbie waved repeatedly it work sometimes . other times it works just fine . yes , we paid attention our distance dvd player aimed barbie correctly . there no such thing repeating steps bibble quickly . dvd remote works just fine this game .... barbie remote too unreliable . save $24.99 buy some other barbie item . only good thing remote wings barbie flap . but , i think it possible purchase barbie cheaper price flapping wings . if anyone figures out how cross wall bubbles let us know .	-1
it true it not quite what i expected ; it looks like series musical instruments it more like soft puppets happen make noise , but if you realize that what it , it so much fun ! octopus " drum " soft enough drum any-sized child , its song ( press one tentacles ) catchy enough we wore battery out . maracas shake rattle , lobster chimes when it shakes . these simple " instruments " smallest children , not realistic music makers . our child loves hitting " tambourine " " drum , " he definitely dances when we play octopus song . so , no , not musical virtuoso your house . , there better . but simple cute noisemakers ( all easily fit back into their own carrying case , way , form octopus ) , this keeper	-1

thing amazes me magnetix strength magnets . my 3 year old loves playing them , learning basic physics regarding opposite poles magnetism attracting each other , same poles opposing each other . i wish price lower though . i made mistake buying " magnetic construction set " not magnetix brand , it turned out chinese imitation magnets just 20% strength magnetix brand , so they hardly stuck together you couldn't build tall structures . so if you your child into this concept , stick recognized name brands watch out cheap imports	1
somehow we avoided letting our little guy take this shops or playpark - but that only time day or night he bear parted it . real hit any little truck enthusiast	1

my son got this thing christmas . what waste plastic money . capabilities thing not match what box shows , while you might think it works like spray brush , it not . you use their sheets activate solution it sprays . it doesn't even spray ink , its some kind glorp smells bad . additionally , it says " mess free " , bull pucky -- you spray so much get any real color you make mess just buy mass amounts glorp you spraying . i very let down crayola this product . we cutting toy , it works fine , but this thing just crap box . proprietary paper , light colors , pre-defined pictures general weakness strength colors made me chuck it garbage , where it belongs	-1
my " almost 7 year " old daughter got this loom christmas thrilled . one best things it it comes small project already set up started so young child jump right into weaving . before my daughter got this loom , she making home made looms out old shoe boxes which means her projects could not get longer than shoe box , but brio loom allows you lengthen project long you like . loom complex but since it comes already set up , you get preview what you need when it comes time start new project . patient 6 or 7 year old master weaving part which rhythmic theraputic motion my daughter finds fun relaxing . however , setting up loom complex involves lot measuring strings tieing each individual string off , so most likely mom get stuck duty . older child long attention span should able handle setting up loom herself . directions clear but please don't lose them -- i keep consulting them . loom quite impressive looking , much better than expected . it looks like miniture real loom ( which exactly what it . ) it made all wooden parts , even very small delicate parts -- this makes loom somewhat fragile . sitting loom or stepping it break it pieces but it appears durable enough handle normal wear tear . all wooden loom looks nice enough leave out part room decor . but if you not want leave it out , loom folds down flat slides right back into its box keeping project intact ready work next time you slide it out . large balls yarn not fit into box but , still attached project , sit next box . box easily fit drawer it approximatly 3 inches wide 21 inches long . this loom cute but it much more than toy ! it would make excellent gift older children even teenagers because you make projects simple or complex you like -- teenager very creative this loom . i believe this loom also appropriate adults -- fact i would like try it out myself , if i could get it away my daughter :) i hope your child much fun this loom my daughter	1

thank you rio grande !!! this fantastic game this collection fantastically updates clarifies rules ! i slowly collected various carcassone expansions throughout years . problem figuring out how expansions interacted each other ( dragon eat tower pieces ? ect ... ) . after researching expansion interactions on-line , i only got more confused ! this game , originally germany , exchanged manufacturers way . scoring rules also changed ( pretty signifantly ) well . so carcassonne online forums you find contrasting information " correct " way score end game . anyway , this box stores each expansion it own slot . scoring tiles ( 50/100 ) starting tile grouped their own slot . " trader builder " tokens there own slots respectively . " meeples " other wooden pieces share two large storage areas come zip-lock baggies separation . underside box colorfully maps out where each expansion should go back when finished playing . rules extremely well detailed full color . tiles marked ( tiny symbols ) so you know which expasion each tile belongs . scoring board kind locks top plastic tile storage container so things don't shift around if you taking game your friends house . i gave 5 stars but there some things point out : box seems unnecessarily large . there lot dead area isn't used . they include " river " ( not my favorite expansion ) but no specific storage slot thse 12 tiles . this disappointing because i mentioned there definately space included slot these . they could also made some slots future expansions or expansions they decided not include ( count , king scout etc .. ) . all all i can't complain . anyone starting out this definately way go . those you who collected various expansions throughout years i highly reccomend upgrading this product . me it worth investment	1
it given gift 2 year old ( out state ) so i not see him when he received it . i understand his parents he found box before christmas opened it . he got it out box rode it . every day it first thing he goes when he gets home . it big hit him	1

this word game came out hampered word restriction when i played . two players bid down 25 how many words it'll take them get their team say five specific words . success gains card failure forfeits it other team . it tough get people say any words even without time restriction . someone would always win bid some ludicrous number like 5 just take bet , then not get one word correct . fact number words restricted prevented it blurting game like outburst or taboo . i would recommend this game large parties only	1
25 words or less fast-paced fun . i brought this game party crowd such good time it hostess ran out buy her own copy next day . this game keeps you edge your seat really brings out competetive edge . yet , it also appeals those who don't usually enjoy playing party games . let bidding wars begin	1

i love more thorough reviews . i've only played it once but i really enjoyed it . traditional risk too drawn out extremely predictable . i really appreciate order 66 rule . risk 2210ad you artificial 5/6 turn game , while order 66 keeps game happening long you want . it takes real cahones hold against aggressive rep player better order 66 roll . how cool game mechanic forces pace play covertly rather than overtly . you attack chance it or consolidate ? very thing many reviewers across net hate game i think it greatest asset ! also game length always change according chance aggressiveness players . well hasbro	1
i always liked starwars risk . so when this game came out i very excited . only bad thing it it unbanaleced . but it still geart game	-1

we bought these toys when our daughter 10months old , her first christmas . she just loves them . she also recieved some old-fashioned " carved " blocks letters cut into them . unlike these , she quickly chewed paint off some old-fashoined blocks . she chomped these pretty hard they seem put up it little damage . she bangs them together , chews them occationally stacks them . though they recommended older children , i think we made nice choice she able play these years many different ways her skills develop . also , they bigger than standard blocks , so i dont worry anything she should able manipulate them little earlier	-1
this attractive item , but great care must taken red harvester ant colony mailed you . these ants aggressive they bite sting . their venom dangerous those people who tend allergic . pain harvester ant sting compared paper wasp ! check it wikipedia . ouch !! i can't believe these kids ! give ' em ladybug kit	-1
set up this toy little more difficult than i expected . there lots velcro snaps tie closures work , but if your patient , you figure it out before too long . products included much bigger than i expected . main tent huge what i thinking it would . lots little toy balls included , golf club . after few practices little more than glance instructions , we figured out how close tents back up storage . anyone who owned playhut toy before would no problems closing it back up . this our first playhut structure , so we learn ins outs taking it down putting it up . overall lots fun , my daughter loves it .	-1

we bigger version magic rainbow fish . my 4 yr old loves it it lots fun . it little high maintenance due fact you take batteries out dry out battery compartment when you through playing it . if you don't , then yes , tiniest bit water cause compartment start rust . then when you ready play again , just put batteries back screw it back . it rather tight fit 2 aa batteries but it works it fun . far fish swimming lopsided , you give fish chance fill water it ballast or you like my 4 yr old son totally submerged it so it fills up water quicker .	-1
we bought this our 8 year old daughter christmas . she plays it all time . she wont put it down . i don't know why she wanted it first , because we more dog home than anyone would ever want , but she loves it . nose really gets cold , i thinking buying her two these , but am glad i only bought one . it make noise wag its tail , if it anymore it would gotten my nerves . so if you thinking buying this child loves animals , go it . i think you happy purchase , i know your child	1

game really fun play . thing i don't like it only gives you three games play you only play them one time only . questions same don't change . price could lower . i think i would consider buying more games if price right .	1
... make sure double check color , size voltage battery you're replacing or you'll end up eating shipping cost something you can't use . try explaining it 4 year old	1
this ball great my 8 1/2 month old loves it . he also one taggies books which his favorite we cannot leave home without it . ball super soft plenty tags put his mouth . taggies products all really great i would recommend any them	-1
until now , only movie games i found i could enjoy broad spectrum people scene it ? movie dvd/board game reel clues . both these games their advantages disadvantages . disadvantages these games largely overcome shout movies . this game fast-paced , diverse , generally well-conceived . variety questions creativity presentation make this game tons fun . i played large groups ( 7-10 people ) whose movie knowledge ranges movie buff casual viewer , although there some who frustrated because they didn't perform well other players , everyone least couple questions where they first shout out answer , most importantly , everyone fun . everything handled dvd interface . i particularly like way it keeps score . first time we played , we assumed we would remember how many points each team scored during 10-question rapid-fire rounds . but our pleasant surprise , after each round it complete dvd question-by-question re-cap asks which team answered it correctly . this actually enhanced enjoyment quite bit since not only we not count answers during actually game play , it also gave group chance relive excitement occurred when shouting out answers . game only used three times , which disappointing ( hence my durability score ) . but when we thought it , $20 our group seven over two hours excellent entertainment evening . our case choices table ) all go out dinner ( very interactive , least $8/person , probably much more)b ) all go movie ( no interaction group members , $8/person)c ) play shout movies ( very interactive , $3/person)so it seems pricey , but when compared these entertainment options it really isn't bad . it provided much more fun than any other options probably would . obviously , there always place games played many times , but i know i welcome shout movies gift suggest it future large-group gatherings	-1
i purchased this item after reading other reviews thinking it would good way get know friends better , but after reading some cards it seemed like most cards asked same questions or rearraged wording most . i disapointed cards , returning them even more fun ... i pay $9.00 ship them back company over month later still waiting refund , i finally email company find out what taking them so long they emailed me back saying they charge restocking fee order issue me refund although package only opened , not used . i'm still waiting my refund won't order this company again . overall it cost me over $20.00 try return this product .	-1
i originally bought this my family christmas dinner , where conversation lackluster , but i never busted it out . then i went dinner bunch people who knew each other , but not well . we played cards all night long . people there really seemed like it , it created some great conversations . highly recommended .	1
these table topic cards great conversation starters . better mid- large-sized groups . you're guaranteed learn something new everyone who participates . it great way get ' outsiders ' feel comfortable within new group . some questions funny , others thought-provoking , but all sure spark conversation or two . cards themselves substantial quality heavy-duty plexiglass case , so don't worry them wearing out after few parties . perfect host/hostess gift , too	-1

i only bought this set get two skeleton figures included , but quickly became very attached playset . it very simple straightforward , takes roughly three minutes assemble , no secret details won't show up picture , but it very imaginative too . something castaway setting , its sparse yet sufficient accessories , just inspires fun stories survival battle shelter . i should also add i like rowboat included , find dock look surprisingly realistic . use this man o-war , ice fang , or captain cutlass pirate ship you tell elaborate story marooned characters washed upon small island cursed become walking dead . i don't think any other small " booster " sets pyrates or dragons fosters this level imagination . they're mostly simple battlegrounds fight . maroon gally stands out quite different res t.t he three pirates included fantastic too ! each super posable ( far moreso than figures dragons series ) , each highly detailed face body . amazingly , two skeletons real personality coming through their faces , even without benefit eyes . one looks quite ruthless while other vacant stare simple-minded subordinate . third pirate look ruthless determination his face . these guys just begging star your ( or your child ) own epic adventure	1

collector simpsons games it bonus find this updated version original operation i loved kid playing it brought back lot fun memories . this one better simpsons ' games my opinion . sounds great this its not hard all understand what homer saying . also buzzer isn't loud it original game . don't feel guilty buying this if your adult no kids because i said if you enjoyed original its bit nostalgic . not hard really get even smallest pieces out after you brush up your " operation " skills . children its great eye-hand coordination well .	1
i've bought three these already cord connecting tweezers board come off each when pulled even slightly . also i friend who builds computer chips , steadiest hand you've ever seen , he could only get three easier pieces out after much effort . pieces slip off indentation tweezers which makes frustrating game . i can't see any kids able successful this version game . sounds great , though , very clear	-1

this very pretty unique look yasmin . i love dark hair , dark clothes dark make-up , especially purple ! i love purple ! i like how her purple lipstick matches her shirt perfectlty . i like her jeans blue streaks her hair ( though they should purple streaks i think ! ) i really love mask . i said my review midnight dance meygan doll i think she looks more like she going masquerade party than dance but okay . i would like these dolls eventually . they very unique i like they fully clothed !!!! good !!!! i give this doll 5 i am adding her my wishlist . yasmin you look marvelous darling ! simply marvelous ! go bratz !!!!	1
my initial reaction bratz doll line something like , " uagh , how hideous ! " i decided i would buy couple modify them just see if i could make them better fit my idea what appealing fashion doll . i bought two who original concept i liked extent , so i would willing hang onto clothes , meygan genie magic line , cloe campfife set . i wished less radioactive pink , but they alright . meygan now dressed renaissance maiden ( my first face repaint ) , cloe her way becoming nordic warrior princess . midnight dance yasmin fortunate luck beautiful , me , right out box . she reminds me my days art school where " gothic " style took entirely different meaning it manifestations most other schools . this doll certainly not sort rebelious kid who scratched poor poetry devil into her desk , or doesn't her homework because she out smoking park her fellow freaks . she one people who dresses match cool quiet calm autumn night , prefers philosophical conversations state religion if she antisocial standards her highschool councilers it simply because she bored constant babble most teenagers . many my shcool , she probably fashion design student ^_^ . this not keeping identities other bratz dolls , or even other yasmin dolls , but it sort person this particular doll reminds me . so she sits my customized dolls , her cute shiney black shoes very well made blue jeans ( unusual fashion dolls ) , frilly purple top just so cute ! exuding dark beauty rather than sexuality i think she represents herself well . she one i would not mind gifting younger child , she certainly makes sweet addition any older doll collector little family .	-1
you just can't seem go wrong sweden . they good laws maternal leave , produce safe fun drive volvo cars , continue churn out these wooden wonders year after year . era when toy trains dying breed or made cheap plastic , brio continues produce wonderful magnetic toy train systems i remember my youth . wood very high quality toys " free expression " toys sense . there no flashing lights or talking voices , just blank piece paper child whatever he pleases them . possibilities grow these trains over time well . this good starter set ( i got my starter set 1991 it similar this one ) you add . i know playsets they make vary year year anymore , but i school hospital among other things . furthermore , track placed many different ways , more track added , items such drawbridges tunnels placed train your young civil engineer training . i'm 20 years old still use my old brio set . today it what i place underneath my christmas tree ( my grandfather same his old lionel sets his youth ) . obviously this toy i'll around years come . i got good number years out this toy actual toy back day ( before i started using it decorative piece ) . cost might bit shocking people who not familiar brio toys , but you definitely get what you pay . read brio website ( one i found english uk ) you'll see just how well-made these toys really . you can't find some cheap plastic knockoff	1
i bought this game my son when he almost four learning his letters preschool . it provided excellent way reinforce his letter recognition letter sounds he learning . now he six , we still play regularly , but we've able adapt game make it more challenging him . game comes instructions play two modes : 1 . preschoolers learning letters 2 . older kids working spelling rules include several variations play each mode , so game easily adapted skill level all players . either mode easy setup play . beginner level : object collect many letter disks you you move your ' critters ' around board . each letter disk letter one side cute bug other . players pick bug call out word starts letter back . if correct , they roll dice advance board , they get put bug their soup . if they don't get word , they put their bug back ' pond ' . player most bugs their soup winner . littlest ones , it great way start recognize letters phonetics go them . my son mastered this , we made game more challenging - like naming state or type food started chosen letter . there also variation where die used determine how many letters choose during player turn . player says one word each letter disk selected . game lively fun , we usually let everyone say word each letter . we always end up getting silly giggly , kids never realize they kind doing homework ! there also opportunities ' taste ' other player soups , so you get steal bugs your soup . also causes fits laughter friendly competition . older kids , object game earn most points spelling . player rolls die turns over same number letter disks vowels . all players try spell many words possible selected letters before timer runs ou t.t he age recommendation says 5 10 , but i think even younger kids play if they're learning letter sounds . i highly recommend this game	1

while my daughter ( almost 5yrs ) loves her new " baby " , it isn't worth price . i find doll half price target . " crying " just big mess clean up going " potty " , not even worth hassel ! we got my daughter baby born wooden highchair , but baby sits up it she slightly laying down order feed her !! doesn't make sense build highchair can't used doll !

my first impression deck it going most powerful deck ever . i wrong . toon world seems like waste time me . they take long time get going magic jammer or card like , opponent could stop your toon monsters right their tracks . however , if you get lucky you actually get some toon monsters field , you good shape . my favorite card here far relinquished . ritual monsters sometimes pain but it worth it if you get relinquished field . overall , this deck probably just many losses wins if left alone . you may simply want take out various cards place them different deck . if this your first time playing yugioh , not buy this deck . i reccomend begginers buy kaiba evolution deck . hope this helps !	1
i'm 12 years old i play yu-gi-oh !. this deck awsome , but it really isn't starter deck it more like deck higher ranked players like me . but it great deck i would recomend it	1
its very cute , but sound speakers kindof raspy when you volume up high :^( but it still cut	-1
reviewers point out below , dvd good three games . once you played all three , that it . but those three games lot fun . all instructions screen very easy follow . setup time under three minutes . game moves very quickly . there enough variety games keep everyone glued screen all time . even if team opens big lead during game , last round , where teams bet points ( including all points ) , makes game competitive up until last round . game keeps track points screen . it great feature . we played round four people ( two each team ) couple nights ago . it lot fun . i can't wait play bigger teams . bottom line : $8 per game , it great investment	1
i got this game i agree this blast play . however , there only three games one dvd so you only play game three times . so i think $19.99 , you'd better off playing scene it , which way more questions younger players play well because it tad easier	-1
i tried space sand i loved it . kids still enjoying it . they play it over over again . it reusable throughout year next . i gave them each portion it . they measured snow water out bowl mixed it up . they played it , i taught them all snow , water , polymers , etc . forget notes : i gave them mine , so they could good time . i teach school blind visually impaired . i also gave bag it , mars sand , my daughter class school . they played it hours . it pure hands-on discovery .	1

we received this game christmas played it day . our family never laughed so hard during game our lives . later day we " adults only " game 8 adults . amazingly , game still full laughter fun . some adults complained their stomachs hurting all laughter ! we play this game all get togethers now	1
working surface area this unit smaller than original lite brite , but its compact size probably more convenient little hands attention spans . this newer model also features some improvements over old classic including drawer pegs , colored pegs joined into units two , three four pegs making faster plugging easier handling ( see customer images ) . multi-colored array pegs offered format far behnd ? this version lite brite line not same impact original ( which not sale amazon ) , battery-powered light , while low glare , not nearly long-lasting or strong . my thoughts hasbro : 1 . make more theme sheets such examples pictured customer images ( customer images under item picture ); 2 . make mutli-colored joined pegs ; 3 . distribute lighting more evenly behind working area ; both old new models capture all light center frame . but under ten bucks , it still one most engaging solitary games market	1
this review not toy , but service you expect receive amazon.com . if you buying this gift , only so if you months wait , even if item listed available . amazon.com allow you pay your money under guise sending your items , then days later , inform you delay shipping , then week later inform you item just shipped take up additional 10 days delivery . despite site claims item would ship 24hrs delivered 3-5 days . mind you , they're sending it via ups or american home .... honestly , there other retailers out there who more reliable than amazon.com i strongly recommend using them - unless you're okay disappointing little girl your life . i know i hate tell my neice gift i promised her still won't there - even though her birthday passed , almost week this poin	1
my grandson loved thomas engine . he safe using it because there no heat . only drawback it emptied after every use . sometimes time isn't convenient	1
my mom got this my son few weeks ago . i surprised how much he enjoyed it ! he loves his thomas big loader set , but because this set didn't move many things around , i worried he wouldn't enjoy it . i wrong ! he loves it ! he loves pull thomas into station fill him up steam . steam comes out illuminated red light so little ones see it . it also cool steam , so you don't need worry burns . thomas also makes noises it goes , blowing his whistle chugging . track fits together easily , several switches , tunnel bridge . thomas his trains stay track 90% time , but easily knocked off . there isn't much way interactive play this toy - just filling thomas up steam . other train engines ( sold seperatly ) go much slower than thomas , so you need quick fingers switches sure they don't collide ! we found james goes 1/2 speed thomas ! also , small switches thomas make it hard small children control thomas - our 5 year-old niece even some problems needed adult help . adult supervision definatly required . my 2 year-old son loves this toy , but it what it - not too interactive , but he loves make it go push his wooden trains his train table around next track	-1
[ ... ] . overall i'd say it good buy . first i thought my son would lose interest it quickly but after two months this still one toys he plays every day . battery still going ( i only initial charge ! ) . also it hit every time we playdate well . yes push botton difficult manuver so you'd either get some kind clip or teach your child use his/her palm push it down which my son got fairly quickly . some revier mentioned , train go off track if your child moves around too much .	-1
normally , i'm not big fan barbie dolls general , but there always exceptions rules ; this one them . i saw her walmart ( clearence ) i fell love her . her dress just stunning her hair beautifully . her face also lacks typical " barbie " smile , replaced slight , gentle , peaceful expression . she even comes stand so i display her outside box her true glory ; she simply masterpiece . if this just pink label , i honestly wonder how masterful silver , gold , platinum labels	1

after my daughter so much fun reef fish ( which i highly recommend ) , i thought turtle would provide enjoyment well . unfortunately , it no fish . movement minimal making it less interesting , it sluggish water , when you grab any fins , they get bent wrong bent back . it only redeeming value she learned say " turtle " . buy reef fish instead , you won't disappointed .	-1
it ain't cheap price , but it ain't cheaply made either . handle other similarly sized puzzles other manufacturers but it not handle chunky puzzles ( one thick pieces ) , so keep mind . overall , helps us keep puzzle pieces puzzles while non use , it helps keep them organized available easy access	1

i don't know why " movie buff " fofee2r3 " gave this bed such lousy review ??! it excellent bed , i used regular twin size mattress box spring sides still high enough keep my son who move all over place falling out . i've also never bumped into it or notice it cold .? i don't think bed problem there .... anyway , there 2 levels adjust height . my son loved this bed , he 6 now really wanted bunk bed we needed consolidate some space so we got him nice loft bed desk under it . i'm sad see car bed go ! it very sturdy , easy clean ( not really big deal reach down mattress pull out fallin ' toys ) . it great bed worth every penny ! i think recommended age should go high 7 or 8 , most kids would love this bed very long time	1

this first go board i ever , ten years ago ( looks like it still same it then ) . game go itself wonderful , everyone should learn teach all their friends . this equipment , though , poor quality overpriced relation lack quality . board itself cheap wood laminate -- i carried mine around backpack few times , corners started coming apart . it basically plywood , won't survive ungentle use like solid piece wood . stones cheap plastic things , whereas basic set good ceramic/glass stones not expensive . lastly most importantly , this go set * tiny* ! while make it more compact , it very hard manipulate . fingers constantly bump ( very lightweight ) stones accident , it hard avoid messing up board layout , whole " feel " game lost	-1

chenga great game whole family . any family member old enough understand idea trying not knock down tower old enough play , which usually means anyone over three . there good deal skill children learn slow , calm , careful when pulling placing pieces , which makes this game very educational , least sense learning self-mastery . game also fun suspenseful , each time someone takes turn , everyone hold their breath little while they wait see if tower fall . super-nice feature chenga it allows entire family play same game , without subjecting older members silly baby games like candy land ( which nice , but gets old ) . best all , chenga great value money . this game doesn't cost much begin , super-durable ( almost impossible break ) , unlikely out-grown any time .	1

i bought this toy my six year old christmas , since he saw it magazine somewhere very insistent getting it ( he put it top his " wish list " ) . unfortunately , i could not find it any store leading up christmas , so i purchased it amazon through highlights children , it arrived bit later than expected ( not amazon fault , problem supply highlight ) . it however , very much worth wait ! my six year old my eight year old blast putting blocks together then watching suspense they unexpectedly fly apart . great imaginative play opportunities them crashing hot wheels , other cars , or rc vehicles into wall or tower constructed blocks watching them " blow up " . they also build some their creations then drop them carpet few feet up which also causes " explosion " blocks fly apart . blocks so far amazingly durable . sometimes springs come out , or hinged brick halves come apart , but they put back together relatively easily , both boys this themselves no problems . very satisfied this toy i would highly recommend it , but you likely trouble finding them store , so look get them on-line ( they light so shipping not excessive ) . if you more than one child , you may want consider getting two sets , since this provides enough blocks two children play together sets combined build larger structures	1
horrible product , very cheap . put cabinet together , played it one night product never worked right again . never forget old saying , you get what you pay , stay away	-1
my son got this gift he loves it . he never seems tire racing cars round round . he even likes try push cars up ramps . our experience it worked almost all our hot wheels matchbox cars . there only few either too long make it around curves or two wide go down , but majority worked just fine . some cars go faster than others , which makes racing more fun . only annoying thing track makes race car noises says things like " speed , i am speed " " you're one gutsy race car " . however , you turn sound off or just remove batteries if sounds make you nuts .	1

just got this figure ( via amazon ) i must say i'm very impressed ! huge fan g1 transformers , i felt like kid christmas when this arrived my house . detail extremely impressive it looks great standing next my other transformers ( especially alternators/binaltech figures ) . only problems difficulty getting prime hold his gun correctly ( which other people already mentioned ) slight difficulty i transforming him ( although it probably because i just got figure it doesn't transform exactly like original prime figure 1984 ) . good , however , highly outweights bad there isn't much you knock this toy . parents , i would not recommend this toy kids under 10 but i definitely recommend it any adult fan transformers , especially fans generation 1 .	1

i horrible experience this toy . email i sent company , which follows , explains it well . because it long email i sum it up ( those who don't time read such lengthy review ) saying quality this product amongst lowest i ever encountered any consumer product . many pieces not fit well together , other too tight , one piece not work , piece intentionally made not operate correctly . i enjoyed capsela child , which wonderful high quality toy back then , but now i utterly disheartened garbage now manufactured capsela . dear educational insights : there moments my childhood remain forever blissful . reminiscence playing capsela ranks one my all time favorites . i played enjoyed capsela many years child starting 500 set . later , i got 5000 set , then i finally got 1000 set . i not know what happened my 500 or 5000 sets , but i still 1000 set when i got older . five years ago , i accidentally left it behind when i moved . i daughter who now eight-years-old , i decided purchase 1000 set so she i enjoy wonderful way her learn science : through timeless play capsela . i am appalled what sits front me . i am so disappointed i actually feel nauseous . quality this toy utterly horrific . this horrible experience started motor capsule . connection output motor unbelievable loose ; toy falls apart during operation . it so loose lightest piece , coupler , connected octagonal connector fall right off motor capsule . i thought perhaps this fluke , i originally going contact you see if i could exchange this poor part better one . upon playing more parts , it obvious this no fluke ; almost all piece spectacularly bad . i played half parts , here list problems i found : -- there connections which so loose amongst many capsules other connecting parts capsules parts disconnect during normal play . -- there connections which so tight some capsules other connecting parts it would impossible eight-year-child disassemble . ( i hurt my fingers disconnecting some these tight parts myself . ) -- there octagonal connector connecting two transmission capsules together , octagonal connector connecting two capsules ( empty ) together , octagonal connector connected single capsule . i actually remember my first 1000 set these connections when i first opened it . i surmise this during packaging so these capsules , which separated into two halves , stay assembled during storage . problem octagonal connector single capsule cannot removed . i not try use any tools remove it because i suppose it possible union intentionally permanent . it should not permanent connection , octagonal connector should able removed . -- one crown wheel capsules not work : gears not mesh properly . reason this next problem . -- speed reduction capsule , worm gear capsule , crown wheel capsules , internal gear capsule , clutch capsule all internal piece supports some gear shafts . these support pieces loosely fitted each capsule which causes lot vibration ( gear shafts not stable because it ) excess amount noise . problems vibration noise very bad worm gear capsule ; it so bad noise almost intolerable . -- some chain pieces not connect tightly . result , these loose pieces disconnect during operation , chain falls off gear wheels . ( chain gear wheels used my favorite part this toy . ) -- capsules ( empty ) separated into two halves . these two halves fit together , but not so well . when only one side these capsules connected , opposite end slightly ajar due imperfect alignment . this really not operational problem much it aesthetic problem . there few projects where capsule only one connection , ajar end makes it look ugly . -- there design change wires way they connect parts which receive these connections . first glance , it seem like improvement . connecting ends wires now shrouded . these plastic shrouds tooth which fits into notch either motor capsule , rotary switch capsule , or switch box . teeth shrouds red wires not big enough , such , teeth not fit into notches which means wires not line up when making connections . this not problem since wire not actually need connected certain way , but it low quality attribute this experience . -- although not problem , i disapprove battery cases now fastened screws . this not make easy exchange batteries ( infrequent it may ) . -- it may trivial , but cardboard separators inside box flimsy , lousy job organizing pieces . original foam packaging much better . -- this final problem one which prompted me actually contact you all these problems . rotary switch capsule not work . reason it not work not because some horrible manufacturing . it not work because there wire inside capsule connects electrical connectors both ends capsule together ! this unbelievable ! this totally defeats purpose rotary switch capsule . even person who not any sort analog electronics experience plainly see through this transparent capsule this wire provides uninterrupted current . whole point this capsule interrupt current it spins so create blinking light . why , omg , please answer me why , there wire inside this capsule allows current pass right ? i course analog electronics , this connection makes no sense . you totally ruined this capsule this connection . why you this ? i know educational insights not original owner capsela . it apparent your purchase capsela name only monetary gain . you not care quality product you brand nor scientific , learning experience which this toy provide . you grossly ruined wonderful toy . now instead my daughter learning science through educational play , she gains " educational insights " into substandard commercialism caused corporate world greed	-1

fisher price recently discontinued this dollhouse so you should get it now while you ! i love kithen few other furniture peices built . this dollhouse comes special family speaks when placed special spots house . i gave this item 4 stars instead 5 because its hard find special bonus packages furniture enable house talk . i able buy all them ebay . just expect pay more than retail . i like this house better than twin time few reasons : #1 twin time house boring ! twin time house comes empty- whats point buying dollhouse looks like bunch plastic squares ! #2 you spend more filling twin time house because sweet sounds comes kitchen , family , few furniture pieces . #3 sweet sounds dollhouse larger rooms . even if you cant get all special feature rooms , its still worthwhile get this house because it larger rooms family , cat tape recorder make house talk which more than twin time house	-1
we purchased this dollhouse our three year old daugther last july when she turned three . fortunately , time , i went bit crazy ordering furniture bought almost all furniture sets made activate sweet sounds dollhouse . i just recently discovered , however , you cannot buy loving family furniture made dollhouse department/toy stores . instead , you buy it three five times original price individual ebay ( i.e. , $54 up one set which originally cost $12 ) . if you decide buy this dollhouse , furniture you actually need activate some 200 phrases must contain item called " bonus feature " . bonus feature furniture sets come certain furniture item ( i.e. , wrapped gifts balloons , parrot , blue television , tea set , blue teddy bear ) pink or blue ribbon attached . those items activate dollhouse sounds . yes , you still buy doll furniture fisher price twin times fisher price dollhouse same size scale sweet sounds dollhouse , but furniture not activate dollhouse supposed 200 phrases . personally , i think it atrocity fisher price continues sell this dollhouse marketing claim it over 200 phrases . majority those so-called phrases activated extra dollhouse furniture you used able purchase . hence , claim fisher price ( aka mattel ) makes dollhouse over 200 phrases misleading false advertising because dollhouse only comes few pieces activate dollhouse sounds ( i.e. , adult female , adult male , child female , cat , tape recorder ) . that it ! someone else put together list all sets you used able purchase so you see what i'm talking here ( although representative picture displayed furniture left not always same item boxed picture right -- boxed picture right shows correct furniture activate dollhouse ) . please see : http://mydreamdollhouse.com/fpdollhouse_sweet_sounds.htmlobviously , fisher price and/or mattel believe parents we stupid we don't pay attention details . they incorrectly assumed we not recognize although they sell sweet sounds dollhouse ( probably because they lot left deplete their inventory ) , they don't sell corresponding furniture activate house . why then spend extra $20 pay electronic dollhouse sounds when you purchase fisher price twin times dollhouse much less ? although i already own almost all sweet sounds dollhouse furniture sets , i now developed great disdain unscrupulous business dealings manufacturer who no longer supply corresponding furniture this sweet sounds dollhouse . lastly , today i contacted supervisor within mattel customer service ( 1-800-432-5437 ) . although she very nice , i could hardly believe their computer datebase not reflect corresponding activating furniture discontinued . she totally unaware people across globe cannot purchase it anywhere but ebay ridiculous prices . i not realize when i spoke her there this message board so many complaints this regard , however , i pointed out her i unable find furniture sets ( " bonus feature " ) any stores everyone ebay bidding them up three five times original price ( i think fairly convincing her ) . dare i say omittance word " discontinued " mattel database completely purposeful because they don't want their customer service representatives telling consumers you we no longer get activating furniture because they want you buy up inventory remaining dollhouses ! i'm sorry , fisher price , but not all parents quite dumb you think they . mother two toddler girls ages 2 3 , i am going boycott fisher-price altogether because i think this unscrupulously deceptive marketing their part . i cannot return all unopened furniture sets sweet sounds dollhouse , but i certainly continue raise awareness via internet . final word : if you don't care whether or not dollhouse makes sounds talks , then go ahead spend extra money , although feature otherwise useless . truth , you're wasting your money because you buy dollhouse doesn't electronic sounds considerably less money . signed , mad heck mattel sunnyvale , californi	-1

this game very addicting ! more players you , better , more fun . i say this game played up 14 players if two willing share turn . objective game kill sheriff once sheriff killed , whole game over . this game involves many strategies , which makes it very challenging . what makes this so strategic you could killing wrong person , like mafia instance . there two vice sheriff who protects sheriff . there 3 outlaws , whose goals attack sheriff , one renegade , who basically tries outwin everyone . it may little tricky beginning but once you get hang it , you'll love it . i didn't enjoy it first but after two games , i'm hooked ! try it i'll bet you'll like it .	1

this starscream toy so much better than original there no comaparison . jet mode , which how figure comes boxed very convincing toy jet , unlike some more recent transformers figures which only resemble vehicles because they wheels or wings . robot mode where this toy really stands out , even over optimus prime megatron same toy series . this version starscream almost perfect match character original generation 1 cartoon series . its amazing ans shame other toys this line not close their animated counterparts . robot mode figure pretty poseable , legs nice range movement , arms . head little hard move because air intakes , but it good enough . only thing i really nitpick it length arm cannons . they go too far back ( up over shoulder ) so order guns point straight out you need bend down wings . thing strange , why need firing missiles ? cartoon they not missiles , but laser guns . optimus prime doesn't firing weapon , why starscream need one ? if guns didn't need room springs they could made fit arms closer negating need move wings gun point forward . not huge deal , but little annoying nonetheless strange oversight otherwise increadible transformer	1
girls love all versions bratz . mom , i think bratz dolls look too mature their presumed ages . makeup way over top their clothing only compare " ladies night " . big babyz underware only described thongs . however , finally kidz version improved upon . makeup still strong , but more acceptable . clothing closer what kid would wear overall look more innocent than other bratz dolls . if you've also found bratz dolls objectionable ( even though i still buy them ) , kidz version much more acceptable my 7 y.o. daughter seems like these better than any other version .	1

this game great classic game . but what happened big boggle ? it provided more letters longer words . reviewer wanting lights applause her daughter ... puh-lease ... :	1
my grandmother bought boggle family over twenty years ago , when i elementary school . we loved it , both kids adults ( i still own copy ) , played it often . my grandmother her friends continued play it even after we grew up : her original set her " game night " stuff when we sorted through her estate ! ( it still good shape , too , though obviously much-played . ) course , boggle highly educational ( especially spelling vocabulary ); it lot like word find puzzle . but boggle , letters don't straight line . this encourages players look things different ways , which course helps problem-solving skills . more than educational , boggle really fun . it suitable families or all-adult groups . " grown-ups , " course , easier time finding words ; scoring takes this into account , though , so kids fair chance . timed rounds keep pace up , three minutes per round , it easy play quick game or turn it into marathon session . one cool feature boggle only unique words count towards your score , so it race find long , unusual words or words unusual configurations . ( adults get quite competitive ! ) only drawback : shaking cubes into place very noisy , so don't play it while youngest family members asleep	1
my family playing boggle since i 10 yrs old ! i am now 46 . somewhere line we graduated big boggle ( 5 letters or more ) we always played after dinner , even my grandmother . we needed teams beat my dad ! our set seen better days . we can't seem find replacement ... anyone know where big boggle gone	1

my daughter loves this simply because it princesses it , it violin . however , sound quality not great , cinderella arm fell off within day or two opening it . also , 1/2 time , it doesn't play automatically when she runs bow across heart . she 4 loves it despite it shortfalls parents perspective	-1
this excellent product introduction instrumental music . kids " play " music programmed violin , or use buttons finger board any variation major scale . bowing action finger buttons great " reality " playing violin . our daughter loves pretend play orchestral instruments music dance . this perfect toy her so she could actually make her own music or " play " orchestra . provided song book quite limited simple melodies . toy durable forgiving . little princess icon seemed only fragile part toy . it not easily breakable much more durable than real violin ! seeing our daughter wanting play more music her own , we decided rent violin started her lessons . toy , this great creative child it also great introduction playing real violin ! otherwise we would never known	1
i agree other reviewer . my daughter received this small baby i didn't think much it time . 2 years later , its most beloved toy she . i couldn't explain appeal , but boy she love it ! we also ordered second since shes already loved it year doesn't seem sick it(such small price pay case pig number 1 disappears ) . we now ordered bear like it her brother . we'll see if he likes them much .	1
my daughter love care bears over 2 years most them . course she new ones . this bear very soft , fur different than original bears . he also very colorful " tutti frutti " scented . since he floppy posed his hands feet stuffed but not his arms legs . it same size all other regular size care bears . he fast taken #1 spot her favorite care bear list . his multi colored body very cute . he also comes dvd wich #133 care bear library . it episodes " gift caring " " i , robot heart " . it runs apprx . 24 min . hope this helped ! this definitely must any care bear fan	1
i don't usually get taken commercials , but apparently i blindsided this one . although this such great promise wonderful outlet creativity , it proved excercise frustration . we even read followed directions ( dilute paint ! ) . nutshell : it takes long time paint travel down tube splatter out end ; adding too much paint create runny mess ; funnel easily becomes unbalanced , shakes , stops difficult control ; colors very weak , contrary commercial ; my kids ( ages 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) all quickly moved ; paint congealed now appears permanent part inside tube ; last ( but not least ! ) it stains even promptly laundered clothing . i expected so much more trusted name like crayola . your money would better spent buying basic chalk . you'll even enough left over treat whole family goodies ice cream truck . perhaps melting popsicle would provide better entertainment than color cyclone	-1

yes , we complete entire game which probably shows our stupidity or boredom . painfully played this game six 24 fans . you read every review challenges using remote arbitrary best . you basically guess when you going decide move your player . some other challenges quite good . why they board this game ? it only used if you get past three days then you get play challenges again . someone who completes several challenges gets enter ctu most anti-climatic ending imaginable . if you 24 fan , not buy game . if you enjoy dvd games , not buy game . if you enjoy frustrated because game stupid quirks no one ever tested , this you	-1

i gave this my 6 year old his birthday he loves it . tricks very simple learn perform . product description says it multiplying coins secret change bag , but it doesn't . set includes following 4 tricks : 1- " sword stone " trick where child uses secret ring get sword out stone . 2- trick where child change color string white red pulling it through wooden box/gadget . 3- illusion box where items " disappear " when they dropped inside4- trick box dice where child guess side/color dice audience member chosen . anyway , even though tricks don't match product description , i think set perfect 5-7 year old . ( any older , it may not so great . ) set wooden which nice durability .	1

i agree previous reviewer these kelly dolls both fun cute i would add : wholesome ! these dolls great ! yes some them may become collectors items over time . but they're only really valuable if you leave them their boxes unopened . ( which what i am trying now ! ) but they so cute it hard resist opening playing them . i love all my kelly dolls this set very good value . i give this set 5 big stars . we love you kelly !!! kelly dolls always young sweet ( unlike big sister barbie sometimes ) always appropriately dressed . it really hard go wrong kelly doll !	1
this great game whether you 2 people or 10 people !! it make hours enjoyment . i've never seen game like this before wish there more like it . anyone play it get pretty competitive !! i love it !	1
you not disappointed this game . i recently , christmas eve , taught two " virtual reality " boys , 13 16 , play this we played 2 1/2 hours then when they left they asking when they could play again if they could get game themselves . wonderful family game . i love this . playing years sometimes pass 6 - 7 hours fun laughter .	1
i actually quite surprised how much fun this play . you play batman one 5 episodes . each episode new criminal . you must unlock first 4 episodes play fifth . i unlocked it , won't give criminal away , but it only 2 levels . every other episode 5 levels before you meet criminal face face . all episodes lot same concepts graphics . you may running room room solving mysteries beating up bad guys . other times you bat boat shooting baddies obstacles . sometimes you outside fighting bad guys trying reach end level . once you played first level , same music you get rest game . repetitive it sounds , it actually fun bat-a-rang beat up bad guys , solve mysteries open locked doors , other puzzles . it wasn't just mindless repetition . grappling hook helps batman climb levels or swing spots too high jump . very cool item . controller saves your progress after you finish each level mission . it not save after " bat " checkpoint . checkpoints only save spot game case you get killed . this prevents you starting whole level over . nor could you save any point . controller shape very good so i didn't comfort issues it . it engage you quite bit some game levels challenging , if not frustrating . it engrossed me long while now find myself wanting solve levels play last episode . there objectives here mild story lines . short , this potential far more robust game , but made late 1980 retro look feel . i wish tv games would gear up us older , more serious gamers . they need start using tv resolution 480 720 . 16 bit color sound would help . i only gave it 4 stars because they could much more this controller game . music wasn't very diverse but doesn't get your nerves either . all things considered , definite " must " your tv games collection . tip : some point jump rooftops . few those spaces too far apart jump . you need grapnel hook . press hold " " , aim diagonal , then release " " fire . swing safety	-1
absolutely adorable playhouse , i get many compliments it . my husband able put it together 1/2 hour i able move it around myself	1
our 17 month old loves these playhouses , but we live texas , most not well ventilated . i didn't want spend few hundred dollars one she could only use inside , or outside handful months per year . this playhouse not only pretty snazzy looking , but also extremely well ventilated -- one completely open door , large window , but it also closeable door window shutters , so she still play open ! shut ! open ! shut ! her heart content . [ see photos get better idea what i mean . ] i expect she able use it though most summer here	1

i like " classics " line transformers . without exception toys this toy line , which made resemble original g1 toys , superior many ways . astrotrain no exception . he transforms into 3 modes , space shuttle , bullet train robot . space shuttle mode he looks part . only thing weird sides bullet train flanking hte fuselage , but it minor doesn't detract shuttle all . train mode , well first off lets say original astrotrain turned into steam engine , which , if you think it what kind stupid , since year original g1 set , most trains diesel ( still ) . i mean why would you combine futuristic shuttle museum-relic train ?. now he turns into bullet train , although not perfect not bad . only strange part if back end looks like it sits up stilts since wheel tips folded down shuttle wings . now robot mode where this , most other " classics " shine . this toy extremely poseable , looks like his g1 cartoon counterpart . only things keep it perfect cockpit sections outside forearms also either side feet . they not too distracting , but they just little wierd . compared poseability original astrotrain toy , however , this new one much better , much more fun	-1

we resisted buying these because they seemed so cheap ... also usual question we parents always ask ourselves ... " what they going them ? " our son received his first bionicle friend his ninth birthday ... it cleverly " bow " birthday present . i now regret overlooking this wonderful line " lego " so long ! my boys love these ! they best time building them even better time playing them . they priced reasonably so you always pick-up one treat during trips out " shopping " . if you encourage your children " save-up " some their " wants " , cost these low enough it doesn't take them months months realize their goal . please not make same mistake i made misjudge these toys . you denying your child great experience . although manufacturer suggests ages 7 up , i not feel child younger than 8 or 9 would able indendently put this toy together . my 7 year old needs some help putting these together , but he loves try all himself . point lego , construct play . primary benefit , my opinion , satisfaction " doing it " yourself ! definate a+ our boys ! rosemary	1

myself five other people sitting around living room area cabin after breakfast one morning february trying decide something . we didn't want go out because it far too cold nothing open yet anyway . so someone asked if anyone room wanted play game phase 10 . everyone readily agreed play game . rules explained , cards dealt four or five hours later we finally winner . game lot fun time goes quickly . time we realized how long we sitting there playing it , nobody could really believe it . girl who brought game cabin said it more fun if you lot people playing but it also takes longer play it . it goes quicker less people . this first time i ever even heard this game . after rules explained i still big confused how play , but after game gotten started i caught pretty quickly . this good rainy day game when you can't go outside . or one those days when you're stuck home few friends , your siblings and/or your parents don't know what else . it'll definitely kill few hours or so boredom . i love games . i closet full board games i can't get hardly anyone play me . maybe i'll better luck getting someone play phase 10 me since there no board drag out set up	1

my 3-year old got this his birthday beginning september . when asked what he wanted , response invariably , " castle . knights dragon . " well , we got him dragon rock castle , well dragon rider several additional dragon knights . castle itself comes several knights already , so he ended up good collection warriors start out . first all , i've seen this castle listed variably dragon rock castle , dragon castle and/or rock castle . not confuse it smaller cheaper dragon tower found toysrus . this castle big ! it 26 " tall takes up good deal floor space if you want room really play it . play 2 3 hours build castle - especially if your child younger . older children , building it part fun . it constructed * very * strong plastic uses two types connectors attach wall segments together . there actually additional connection points not used if you follow included plans . this gives flexibility customize castle . castle holds together well , but just lose enough under rough play , parts come apart before they break . this good thing - especially when played extremely immaginative 3 year old . note roofs towers simply rest place rather than locking . this also good thing , once you see this toy play conditions . notable point this 3 storey castle . there sufficient ladders doors knights get any location real path . there no " magical " jumping required . other thing note accessories provided . there lot parts many them quite small . ladders , pole arms , shields , swords , but also daggers , beer mugs , torches , fish bones , even some rats scurry . if you're not careful , it would easy them end up vacuum . fortunately , our son really likes all detail , so he very good making sure all parts put away when . far play concerned , this toy gets play daily basis . sometimes solo , sometimes friend , sometimes parents . it visible helped his fine motor skills serves springboard his imagination . he used some his own " pennies " buy princess he could lock dungeon rescue . sometimes dragon good dragon escaping castle or maybe helping defend castle , sometimes it bad dragon they fight . flexibility play limited only child imagination . he now asking santa " good knights castle , " which his term knights errand castle . he want able two castles wars , rescues , etc . summary , this excellent toy hold child imagination . it not politically correct , which i find refreshing relief . it definitely boy oriented lots weapons , armor shields wars , sieges , chaining prisoners dungeon . makers this castle paid incredible attention detail quality	1

recently received this our 5 year old i really cannot recommend it anyone . master mind terrific game concept developing logic , but this version game few problems . most important , slightest bump furniture or board , game pieces not stay shallow indentations board . game over . it really simple pretty much inevitable . also scoring peg tray overflows into secret code location so every time one digs out scoring peg wave pegs flood secret code cave . other comments : pegs scoring pegs color coding not too different size , both come red . pink light purple there also purple - confusing small kids . if you know original master mind , you'll know there 4-peg code , scoring it such " code breaker " doesn't know * which * his colored pegs correct spot or correct color . kid mm 3 peg codes , but scoring indicats * which * peg correct spot which correct color . thus after few plays it close impossible child who " gets " trick not guess 3 rounds , it seems discourage logic exercise since feedback any old guess just well . what i'm trying say even if gameboard well designed i wouldn't recommend game kids over 5 . but given tendency pieces fall over , i would send manufacturers back drawing board	-1
kids enjoy seeing progress plants growing . took little while longer than we thought , but they fun watching their ' science project ! i water more often than directions say , might help speed up growth ! it window gets sun every morning , great spot	-1

sasquatch fine marvel legends figure . he really tall looks great ! we certainly don't see alpha flight characters come through marvel legends often enough , so he really worth picking up . his body sculpt same man-thing marvel legends series 8 , so articulation/poseability very good joints tight well concealed . paint looks good furry details head toe really bring him life . nicest thing this figure he looks like he right scale most other marvel legends figures . character 10 feet tall this figure appears tall when compared other figures . maestro hulk ( also available this series ) doesn't appear right size . he right width , but not tall enough . i think if they get it right sasquatch , they get it right everybody else . sasquatch comes copy alpha flight #10 . it excellent comic shows you him action . comic , sasquatch battles fantastic four villain , super skrull . it good kids read . this series called apocalypse series because , past series , 6 figures piece 7th , larger figure-apocalypse . apocalypse 5,000 -year-old mutant arch nemesis x-men . he turns out 14 inches tall he looks really , really good when he all assembled . he best one series . most people probably won't consider character selection this series best , so it good idea toybiz release these figures this fashion . personally , i love character selection idea building , larger figure . they should continue it future releases . everyone want put together their own apocalypse since he very hard get when he made his 6-inch appearance marvel legends 7 . sasquatch pretty well stocked , so if you want him apocalypse piece or not , you're still getting great action figure who plays displays well . there version this figure available , but it harder find . ( this one series lots different versions figures ) variant figure called " frozen " sasquatch . instead his fur all orange , it all white make it look like he out canadian snow while . it exact same figure different paint job . you're not really missing much all if you can't find it . orange version every bit good , if not better . if you want white fur , paint over orange version . i highly recommend this figure marvel legends/alpha flight fans .	-1

this expansion pack base settlers game puts some twists into classic version . i believe classic version still much better , but this nice change pace those who like variety . keep mind , this not allow you play more than 4 players still , so if you think expansion pack enable you bring more folks into fun , you should consider other expansion sets . game itself pretty well constructed . there these little resource " flip charts " spiral bound seem bit flimsy . we'll see how they hold up over time	-1

my 21-month-old daughter loves this sandbox . it perfect size her friend play . ( today there three toddlers playing around it , it tad crowded . ) my kiddo sits little ladybug head when she plays but if she friends over , they stand or kneel around or it . kids don't seem mind too much since they're just happy playing dirt . :d even 100 lbs sand it it lifted dragged if necessary . i'd say 4 or 5 years old this might too small , but toddlers it wonderful . only drawback me lid not watertight , so when it rains quite bit water gets inside . no problem my daughter though , because just makes sand more fun play !

these cute fun play . my daughter loves fisher price little people . side note concerning eductional value discussion - evolution theory - not fact . it not bad theories go , but it doesn't answer all questions , many holes need filling ( lacking fossil records , inability verify carbon-dating , not one example " missing link " ) . people who believe creationism get put down " non-scientific " going blind faith , but evolutionist exact same thing name science instead faith . there lot real science out there concerning creationism ( this coming skeptic ) , it worth taking look . scientist would tell me not take creationism face value , that fair , but don't go complete oposite way blind faith either - ask questions ! either way , this toy sure conversation starter kids adults !	1
i don't think anyone say humans weren't around when dinosaurs unless they around back then tell it now . information comes same people tell us we came monkeys ... i'm no ape ! anyways , i think this toy lot potential spark your child imagination . little boys ( some girls ) love dinosaurs adding cute little person it just makes it even more interesting . i don't think size egg any reason knock off point educational value . it made fit dinosaur if it actual size it " should " compared momma dinosaur , then it would choking hazard . order create " accurate " portrayal this toy clearly not ( lions , tigers , bears , oh my ! ) , then dinosaur would nearly three times its size smaller dinosaur egg safe size babies toddlers . i think we all know who needs extra point education .	1

i really think you never go wrong mr. potato head ... it teaches kids problem solving creative thinking , while also letting them practice their small motor skills . plus , it fun ! i've caught myself reliving my childhood playing this toy well . i say , 18 months , my daughter still puts few pieces her mouth . so , we took away earrings flower so she didn't try swallow them . one dissapointment suitcase . i thought it'd great way keep all pieces together , but ... first , case falls apart regular basis . it easy put back together , but it pain deal . second , it difficult simply throw all pieces into case - they really put certain way all fit properly . i it few minutes work , but i can't see my 18-month old enough patience it . i gave up suitcase after few weeks , put pieces see-through bin . case nice idea , but it didn't work us . problems case would not stop me getting this set though - it offers lot variety	-1
i bought this toy my 20 month old daughter she loves it ! it turned out very educational . she verbalizes body parts figure out where they go . i also like carrying case it comes . it makes it very easy travel . however , my daughter needs assistance when playing because mr. potato head not very sturdy his feet falls over when trying put or take out pieces . pieces also hard get out once they inserted into head . overall , it great toy	-1

this far best deal i've seen thomas set . water tower retails alone $24.00 bridge $18 ! my son absolutely wild thomas water tower bridge two things he plays most . i am thrilled they combined them into set track , plan give this gift my nephew . water tower contains liquid appears quot ; drainquot ; when you lower spout ( this alone worth hours entertainment toddler ) . bridge 3 parts very easy young hands assemble . it reasonably stable , although top piece not held place anything other than gravity knocked over accidentally . there plenty room underneath trains track . some cheaper sets bridges so low trains don't fit underneath . thomas brand track excellent quality features indented quot ; ties , quot ; unlike less expensive versions . however , it fully compatible brio , imaginarium , several generic brands market . this set also includes thomas train cargo car start your thomas collection ( watch out ! it addicting ) . these would retail $10 apiece if you bought them separately . if your child already thomas train , don't worry . 2 or 3 year old , two identical trains more fun than one . simple figure-8 track layout best young children who introduced wooden train sets first time . you also rearrange pieces make loop or simple circle . i highly recommend this set first train set any boy or girl age 2 up ! great companion thomas wacky track , which allows wider range curve diameters , reduces frustration level beginning engineers	1

my grandson enjoys exploring many options his dj center loves talk working microphone . it seems well-designed , well-built sturdy . parts it simple enough he fun it now age 3 1/2 years . it includes enough options complexity , however , it also appropriate older children . i expect children grow into it play it several years . i sufficiently pleased it i plan buy same toy my younger grandson when he gets right age . my only disappointment overly simple instruction booklet ( mere 2-3 pages each 10 languages only 2-3 lines each feature ) seems lost something translation english . it not clear how use " guide button " feature or take full advantage other options . so one need explore experiment which not all bad , but little confusing	1

i can't believe how critical some reviews this product . first , this product meant small toddlers . my son 22 months loves this toy . it only blows 10 bubbles time but 18-24 month old child need 100 bubbles ? it easy work my son figured it out after just few tries . it doesn't produce bubbles every time because sometimes he doesn't let handle come back up high enough but 90% time he gets some bubbles . you say wand ? we all blown wand no bubbles come , right ? imagine toddler frustration using wand , it impossible . this toy allows little ones accomplish something enjoy sight brilliant bubbles he made ! final thought , you need prime pump twenty times before any bubbles come it sputter first but it takes all 1 minutes this you're good go . it affordable toy we love this product my house	-1
i could not believe negative reviews this product either . we bought our daughter one she absolutely loves it ! we no problems it whatsoever . only bad thing bubble solution spill out if it tipped over , but bottle bubbles spills hole lot faster . our daughter no problems figuring out how work it it quickly became her favorite toy . it well worth what we spent it	1
i gave this my 24-month old birthday gift . though yet too young really want spend time game , he still enjoys matching up puzzle pieces . this age , it good 5-10 minutes time floor my child . i like fact this game comes tin box rather than cardboard box	1

this nice wagon but we same trouble others - wood sides just don't hold up . they fall out all time it just gets aggravating . wish i would thought all-terrain wagon - certainly would lasted longer i wouldn't so aggravated . assembly okay , but i just think money , you could get something little nicer would hold up better . i'm thinking replacing ours something more sturdier . our little one quite rambunctious things this wagon really trouble keeping up our little one	-1
we this wagon year now . it still wheeling , but paint peeling off there few spots rust wooden stakes sides almost off too . review says not use it rocks firewood because rails small . i would add list 28 pound 2 year old just can't sit still because made wood railings come off also . i guess one their lower end wagons it good deal while it lasted but i am looking into larger more comfortable one now . wheels this one quite small hard manuever unless you street . ( it nearly impossible get up down off sidewalk if there no built ramp ) don't even bother pulling it through grass . spend extra money get one all terrain wheeled wagons .... it worth it !	-1
i just got this amazon because top it cheaper than other online stores i got free shipping it . unfortunatelly my little guy not old enough it yet . i guess i got little too excited it since i so pleased two other toddler plan toys we've gotten him . now it looks very cool sitting top my son bookcase . i really hope he likes playing it future because i would love get him more plan city toys . wood surfaces very soft well finished . it little painted details ( not decaled like plastic toys ) like arrows pointing " baggage , " " departure " " arrival . " baggage belt elevator hand cranked . easy assemble drill or phillips screw driver . simple but very cool . not much more expensive than similar playsets made plastic . used hot wheels or other matchbox cars . only negative thing might blue top dense foam so younger sibling might prone damaging it .	1

remember shrinky dinks when you kid ? well , this same stuff . it still works like it used . get creative - make some custom earrings or keychains . follow instructions ensure good results . also , when you bake them make sure your colors up , otherwise they stick your cardboard . kids ( adults too ... ) still love this stuff	-1

we received it gift our 15 month old runs all over house it . it takes beating stays standing while it yanked around living room . we not any problems screws wheels or leash . initially we let him play it without leash b/c he would get tangled it , but now he run easily it just fine	-1
purchased my grand daughter ... she loves it takes it everywhere . well made very stable she loves wiggle action	1
this looked durable but proved quite lame my 2 1/2 year-old . it rickety there no automatic power off . batteries last only few hours if left . this truck also not work well manually , it clicks no fluid movement- quite disappointment . i bought traditional tonka next week we use this one store other toys . hand-push truck much more fun imaginative toy	-1
she so enchanting . breitta beutiful wings , but me they only come off if i bang her into something . her crown lites up looks so pretty if your playing night . her hair looks very nice when you first get her out . only thing she hard box open , but dont let stop you geting one best barbie horse ever . baribe fan	-1
i purchased this matching barbie kelly dolls my five year old . although no toy ever easy get out packaging anymore , these most difficult . pegasus most difficult three . i cut my fingers twice trying get it out . my daughter very excited receive this pretty horse but quickly became frustrated because , others noted , wings saddle not stay put ! eclosed instructions recommend replacing batteries upon purchase . problem it takes button cell batteries . i think most people ( like myself)do not keep this type battery hand ! barbie also takes same kind battery . although it very pretty toy , it extremely frustrating . i would not recommmend this toy anyone	-1
while i'll admit it took little trial error set it up fly correctly , i never so much fun r/c plane . once tabs horizontal stabilizer taped correct position i reinforced wings some more tape , this thing just took off sky . my 7 year old i got it up well over 500 ft yesterday spent good 10 minutes just trying bring it down . $10.00 + shipping , you can't beat it . i bought 3 these what it would cost buy 1 , more expensive plane . those complaining material these planes made , most r/c planes ( including very expensive ones ) made same material . i crashed 2 these planes least 5 times simply glued pieces back together flew them again . this great plane money	-1
we several other planes estes fly very good . we decided get this one nothing but problems . one day we flew it it flew away fortunately came back . few days later we flew it again ( perfect wind conditions ) it flew away again this time it not come back . my 8 year old son so upset . all other estes products we tried great but not this one . it seemed like radio couldn't control plane reliably	-1

even though my four year old daughter loves this barbie , it huge disappointment when my daughter friend broke tail off . my daughter this barbie less than day before tail broke . mattel should forseen making tail looks bendable but isn't bendable would cause huge disappointment many little girls . our daughter wants " new " dori . i probably break down buy , but least we know now very careful tail . if you buy this barbie , warn your child not twist or bend tail	-1
neighbor bought this little tikes truck my son christmas when he just 6 months old he playing it literally every day last 11 months . truck no sharp corners -- everything rounded smooth surprisingly not scratched any furniture . i'm bit surprised reviewers children injured themselves this toy . my son , now one half years old , injured himself other toys , but not this truck . we've found it very safe , stable toy my son loves scooting it around house , pushing it back forth me , or hoisting it onto our coffee table . lately , however , truck source increasing frustration him . holding bed truck large , but access top ( due handle ) rear extremely limited . he often put something back only extreme difficulty pulling it back out because openings so small . this only reason why i not give it 5 stars	-1
we owned this zip line two years now . set up much more difficult then directions would you believe . pulling wire around tree tightening it far possible requires lot strength . then , each year wire sagged bit more ... although tension increased easily enough ' turning ' bit . however we now its tightest it still sags . my kids only weigh 50 70 pounds so we aren't stressing it . i am now point where i ' rewrap ' wire . like other reviewers , angle must higher than directions state order ride not stop middle . we 15ft down 5 ft . wish i higher ladder so i could set it up bit higher . even my wimpy girls they wish ride bit faster . ride stops good 8 feet bottom tree so its pretty short ' ride . ' i'll my best since i rewrap it anyway . ( long it doesn't send kids into tree ... ) i am not looking forward job , but all said ..... once it set up - ride worth it ! after 2 years easy use everything still running smoothly - although we oil wheels retighted hand piece couple times during year	-1
this best toy neighborhood ! everybody loves it . i never seen my kids play something so long . we bought it august december they still want play everyday . it well worth $ .. investment	1

hi , i purchased one these pools my then 4 yr old daughter she enjoy it shiort while , then one morning i went check pool which covered large blue tarp since it not come cover my surprise pool totally deflated whole middle bottom pool gone , apparently crows liked how it tasted ate pool just sides pool . millions millons tiny bits plastic ppol left all over our backyard it took hours my daughter i pick up . i would never guessed pool would eaten ! it fun few days she played it but maybe seeing this review just maybe they also provide hard cover this pool . we left without pool since this gone . maybe manufacture shoud make bottom not so tasty birds more durable so kids enjoy it longer . i heard one other person who this experience well . warning : kepp this pool away birds ! i advised rep amazon purchase reflective tape place around pool ward off birds ! we hoping we not same experience when we purchase family size center pool . best regards , youngs family .	-1
i bought this pool mainly because we short storage space i liked idea how it folds flat storage . mother 4 year old 1 year old , i am somewhat saddened pool . they love pool . i would preferred different one . it hard get sides stay up i find myself pushing them up more than enjoying my kids playing .	-1
my two year old daughter adored weebles since her first birthday . every few months we give her set weebles add her collection . this set , like all rest , big hit ! set includes three weebles figures : little red riding hood , wolf , woodsman . she plays them weebelot castle weebly wobbly tree house , which both loads fun	1
my baby enjoyed this toy infant now toddler . movement encourages hand/eye coordination ball removable . it also plays music sings abc , she really enjoys it .	-1
we love love love this barn ! my two daughters play it every day it held up great . wood smooth well painted we no problems wear tear issues . said ... animals cheap not so friendly looking ! they remind me cheapo plastic animals you buy dollar store ! not high quality we used melissa doug products . so .. buy barn toss silly animals ! we replaced ours nicer rubber animals .	-1
i am not sure what previous reviewer thinking ! course there no nails - this company clearly knows what they doing ! they only make safe products .... i also found barn very durable . my son very rough his toys this barn stood up test	1
these words my son , who 8 years old bionicle enthusiast : he this really huge axe , that double bladed . he this really cool mask which really tall point top . scale 1 5 , 5 really fun ... building axonn : 5 ! i love really hard bioncles buildplaying axonn : 5 ! it really fun play . you play axe , or throw axe make it come back . it humongous bioncle , he really cool	1
i recently bought this my 19 month old who absolutely loves it ! she'll actually sit down play it good 30 or 40 min , take break , then come back it play it again half hour . shapes perfect size her little hands . each shape also rattle , so they make fun noises younger babies . parent easily open sorter twisting either top or bottom , but i think it would very difficult baby or toddler open . other thing i like this sorter it three shapes either end , so baby becomes more confident toy , they learn how flip it over find opening they need rather then mom turning it them . my daughter started out sorter bucket flat lid 4 different shapes top . this worked when she younger ( though she still liked all sorters ) , but since masteed it therefore grown tired it . this new sorter adds new challenge , so it still interesting her . nice feature each shape opening color coded making it easier child find match shapes . it obviously also great chance teach colors . only negative i mention minor one . hole round shape isn't very tight , so sometimes circle falls back out . it doesn't bother my daughter ( i don't think she notices ) , she just pops it back . some shapes need pushed little harder then you'd expect , but that just helped my daughter learn word ' push . ' all all , i'd say it excellent toy , if bought early 8 months , easily last you year if not longer	1
i bought these speakers my [ ... ] daughter her birthday month after she received fp3 player christmas . she already enjoyed listening music , but she uses speakers all time now , now my [ ... ] son listen too same time . speakers so far proven very durable , they dropped our hardwood floors many times no problem , very simple use , my daughter it down less than 10 seconds , so i'm not always help her it . speakers also get loud enough group enjoy , but not so loud i'm concerned she could damage her hearing if she very close . i would definitely recommend these anyone , especially siblings !	1
i wasn't sure whether we needed these speakers but they used fp3 player more than headphones . only issue we button release fp3 player top near handle my son kept accidentally hitting button when he would pick it up , course player would fly out but it kid tough !! once we figured out problem he more careful . speakers seem kid tough too - they dropped few times well no damage . it appers maximum volume like fp3 player which i didn't know when we bought it - highest volume easy hear . we love fp3 player speakers would recommend them all kids !	1

this toy pros cons . description it sounded like only toy we'd ever need , course baby gets bored it after while . he 8 months now we've it couple months . it very durable it dropped several times doesn't seem worse wear . if you forget shut it off , wobbler very sensitive so it eats through batteries like nothing you've ever seen . i two older children so we'd tried out higher settings , seems like they liked it . i don't know if they really understood " pods " when surrounding light bright you can't really see light queues well . overall we're pleased it , if it lasts his first 3 years it worth it .	-1
it very easy paint . planets two pieces so they sit nicely table while you painting . there plenty paint . planets labeled inside , so you make sure you painting right one right color so you put them together right . it easy put together hang . it comes glow dark paint , so night it glows my daughters room . she loves it . i would highly recommend this .	1
both my son daughter loved their leap pads . there many " books " out there each them teaches something different . we took ours long car trips keep kids busy . battery life pretty good you buy replacement " pens " leap frog . but , this big one , they very brittle . i give service life this model 2 yrs tops . you don't break outside , but computer guts machine seem easily ruined which cause system shut down unexpectedly , mis-read cartridges , mis-read pages , or completely not work . never , ever buy one second hand because there 99.9% chance unit broken	-1
this great idea my twin boys love it . my problem books hard find . those i able find more geared towards older kids meaning those kindergarten or 1st grade learning read . secondly , few books like thomas friends i able find their age group wear out really fast . cartridges come book start malfunction after only few months old . i would skip this one just buy regular leap pad	-1
i lucky enough friend let me borrow this my first son when he 3 months old ( he now almost 2 ) . we hesitant first but immediatley this this toy replaced his expensive bouncer swing . this toy amazing . he loved it . i could finally dishes , clean ... he extremly happy loved music . he would lay there kick laugh .... my husband i also realized after awhile , when we would lay josh bed he looked up celing fan starting kicking . it really appeared he trying make ceiling fan move like toy . when i found out i pregnant again i find one these our next son . we could not imagine life without this . i vowed this would gift i would buy any new parent . it really something you not know you need until you try it .	1

every body says phoebe sweet twiin why ? phoebe my opinion just sassy her sis ! i don't them but i saw them toys ' ' us site only $0.14 !!! i geuss them two , goin ' three years !! i also think these most detailed twiins . oh , foxxi roxxi she not bad . one thing spice my collection she sorta sasha place four original bratz . pic sugar+koby makes them seem like couple , witch i think should happen	1

product very well packaged . shapes fit very easily into openings . only small complaint i top comes completely off . i guess it easier toddlers but i just find it one more item get lost also makes it impossible turn out it falling open . $ i think it worth purchasing .	-1
this one my son favorite toys . he loves hammering it very interested concept getting shapes into correct hole . string attaching hammer so short it makes hammer very hard use , even daddy . if string longer it would probably strangulation hazard , but there no good reason hammer tied . ( if you're worried keeping all parts together there already 6 shape pieces could come out get lost under furniture . ) i cut string off both ends make toy usable	1

i purchased this game gift fellow lover original settlers catan game . after playing this expanded version i'm not sure we'll ever go back original game . this version take some getting used take bit longer play than original game few times we've played thus far . this expansion set offers additional variety original settlers game there many different set scenarios you play which differ number victory points you need win methods you use gain victory points . it simple learn how play this expansion , but i playing it while before i feel like i mastered my method winning .	1
very good add-on original game . adds nice twist makes it so players work together periodically , not just against each other	-1
this toy comes so many different pieces , pretend play possibilities endless ! there several different poses each major characters - dora , boots swiper - all minor characters included well . there may too many pieces younger children , so parents put some away until those children older ready more complex scenarios . this great toy children who beginning engage pretend play	1
i ordered this my 2.5 year nephew christmas , it probably his favorite gift out hundreds he received my overly-enthusiastic family . its great several reasons , 1- it looks cool ! his eyes lit up when he saw it because it looks like realistic construction vehicle , just his size . he recognized it right away his construction books - he immediately screamed " its estibator ! " ( excavator ) 2- its easy use - it took him maybe day really become good controls , which easy move joysticks . so , its not too complex or frustrating work . evening he transporting his fisher price zoo toys scoop one end room other . 3- its easy put together . yes , moms dads , aunts uncles , it takes 3 easy steps . you just attach scoop , plug it riding part , then pop batteries . 4- aside scoop , rest it kid-powered . so , he scoots treads move . it goes fast or slow your child handle . , since it treads , rather than wheels , i don't think toy could speedily roll down hill . ( although , we only played indoors it)negatives - like any other toy , its kind loud " construction sounds " but i think that half what my nephew loved . its durability - i can't really say , my nephew only it week . either way , i am very happy my purchase	-1
who'd thought pinball mixed basball could equal this ? this antique " piseball " game where players take turns batting , object like baseball ! get most runs ! teams 1-9 players long should prove grand-slam game any audience ! japanese game super nintendo that based off this exact game ! this great game all ages	-1
my opinion this doll " ilike raven simon " . but doll doesn't come enough acessories 19.99 just doll clothes like fashion fever dolls just 10.00 more , i'll wait get her clearance	1
my daughter likes it b/c she like " barbie type " dolls but if intent get doll looks something like raven ... you'll truely disappointed .	-1

this condensed version monopoly might actually better than original . playing time usually less than 15 minutes per hand , there no cumbersome board deal . spirit monopoly ( capitali$m ) remains intact , but game goes much quicker - you don't need set aside whole weekend actually determine winner . i bought this last week hardly able put it down . if you buy one game , this should it	1
my husband bought this our son few weeks ago . my son loves toy but its cheap flimsy . superman figure split side after just one day playing it this keeps it filling up air launching . not it matters b/c launch button never seemed work anyway . it would either not push down or you would push it down superman would just barely lift off . don't waste your money	-1
it fun game . expansion set allows more people join fun . set arrived very quickly -- within couple days . i recommend product provider	1
if you game other couples . no doubt you need expansion settlers . this it . downside it slows game down terribly . more players equals more decisions more downtime turns . but if you got six . you got six . so get expansion . but if you want play better 6 player game , play transamerica , or carcassone expansions . good luck !	-1
picture it doesn't say anything tent twin size fitted sheet . thank yo	-1
my son loves play " pegs park " . premise basic it gets . pick card move number spaces your path it says . first get ice cream truck you win . everyone their own path . trick there positive negative numbers so you move forward or backwards . it couldn't simpler yet it exciting when you're very close winning get -10 ! it great number recognition counting . so simple , but very enjoyable . no branded characters , nothing jumps out you , just moving forward backwards board .	-1
once put together , this toy great looking pirate ship . just don't try playing it . lego pieces not stick firmly together , so even slightest touch results entire ship falling apart . after several frustrating attempts play toy , my five year old gave up it . we finally used model glue glue legos together so it wasn't complete waste money . if you don't time or patience same , this toy isn't you	-1

i got this doll , blond haired one , my daughers christmas . i admit , they don't play them much i'd hoped , i think i got dolls more out sentimental value - remembering them my childhood - than anything else . part fun cabbage patch doll name they come , so i little wary buying them online since some names downright weird , but cpk website allows you change doll name print new birth certificate , so helps lot . amazingly , one dolls came same first name one my daughters ! dolls made same way , hard plastic head , soft body , yarn hair , outie belly button tatooed backside , but facial expressions cuter than older version , hairstyles updated , thankfully	1

we got this bed my son when he 22 months old . we moving bought this his new room . excitement his new bed made move happy time him too . he now turning 8 refuses turn bed over his little brother so i guess we need look into one ! we started out mattress bunkie board lowest level so he couldn't roll out , then moved it up next level when he older . toy box front holds alot headboard gave him place go stuffed animals other stuff . i would recomend this bed anyone , it alot fun my son he still very proud show it his friends when they come over	1
we got this game two others this far favorite whole family !! my sister , dad i willing play this game . it plays more like real video game then others , math learning included . this only game i willing play leapster . i remember playing sonic sega handheld thing few years ago it still fun now . game counting numbers . through each place map there three levels play . each level you get 99 rings get jewel . you don't get anything special if you though like i thought , no secret game unlock , just satisfaction getting them all . through each level it ask you find correct number comes after what ever number they give you , like 123 ... what comes next ? you find 4 . if you touch wrong number it make right number glow . so if your child doesn't know right answer , they aren't running you tell them . then there robots catch you you some special math game , every place map different game . most adding subracting you can't move till you get it right . this might hardest part , even i trouble this because one game you circle some robots add them your bucket but they moved so it hard draw cirlce around something that moving . overall this game must !!!! this game get your kid use leapster sure maybe even dad or other kids .	1
my family game family ..... this good one ..... directions bit complicated ... but even my youngest eventually caught ..... dice cheater card fun twist card gam	-1

parents who judge education systems/software ability keep attention today add children regardless actual educational content may like this . they'll only ones though since there no educational content . " i love birthday parties , yeah " - " they're here , let party begin " - " oink oink " . this all we here these machines when we use them , which isn't often . kids click pictures elicit related often unrelated noises - it . there little actual phonics training . phonics " games " only ask one softball question per minute surrounded lot add attention getting fluff . these entertainment systems , not educational systems . we should note leapfrog brand dvds we not like leappads all . dvds very good . leappads worthless	-1
bit small but great price . works great wooden train sets .	-1

i thought it made wood but it more pressed particle board . screws end up breaking " wood " if you screw them too tight . part chair broken when it got it . i already started put other stuff together when i found it so i glued it together moved . two screws not go all way because slot screwdriver got stripped . one screw molded incorrectly so bad it just flat piece metal . i find screw my own . i essentially build this thing myself . i liked colors table chairs would fine if all worked accordingly . wouldn't get this again though	-1

i'd like echo other reviews -- this toy ( yellow matching fighter , natch ) really excellent . age 37 , i so smitten this toy i bought it other one , , er , play my son , yeah . only problems , fake r2 unit ( although i plan see which my r2 figures fit , based comments others made ) , stickers rather hard put . general , this toy indicative extra effort hasbro made ep iii , compared , say , crap they made ep 2 , disappointed me so much i stopped buying figures while .	1

this backpack great ! my son keeps his leapster equipment all together . easy find , travel store	1
my daughter received her l-max christmas this year i wanted place neatly keep her cartridges ( toy us buy one game get one free week after christmas ! ) . these backpacks very popular ! i first noticed ton them december 23 while picking up something else , but december 27 they none ! toys us only place i've seen backpacks . finally , after three atempts trying different stores , we grabbed last pink backpack yesterday . my daughter so excited . only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars because i think (...) bit much- i think (...) would more fair- like backpacks my first little touch leappads ( which work hold up very well ) .	-1
this very cute dress up trunk -- however , glenda witch crown fit me , bad witch really little shirts all three outfits really short -- which problem my daughter . she likes her shirts long enough tuck these definately weren't even close . if isn't problem your little girl , this would probably fine -- just deal size difference witch hats	-1
my kids love this uno . my kids ages 10 12 . we spongebob uno , but they rather play nintendo one . we never play regular original uno anymore . cards very colorful easy see . course , each character uno all unique rule just play particular game . so , it different than regular uno and/or sponebob uno etc . it makes playing uno lot fun new twist each time . highly recommended	1

i'm happy report risk still timeless wonder it when i kid . 6th grade ( when i received this christmas present ) 10th grade ( when other priorities arose ) , rainy weekend or summer day often meant getting together friends epic game risk . we would absorbed game hours . it enough strategy involved we could convinced our generalship , enough chance we could blame defeat dice . we played it enough i absorbed geopolitical lessons questionable truth : iceland kamchatka not keys controlling north america . ukraine not nearly big . our family given risk game gift few years ago . i always trying interest kids game , but my daughters ( 13 10 ) not very interested . finally , my son ( age 7 ) though he might like play . i torn . one hand , i loved game , other , he bit young . i didn't want ruin it him introducing it too early . end , we gave it try . he needed bit coaching , but he grasped basics game play pretty quickly . we blast . next time we free hour or two , he asking try it again . my observations : 1 ) risk not ruined forces time or political correctness . game almost exactly i remember it . small pieces now shape soldiers ( 1 army ) horsemen ( 5 armies ) cannon ( 10 armies ) , but they function exactly like old triangular pieces plastic i used use . map still 19th century feel it . dice attacking defending even still same color . 2 ) my son bit young age 7 . he needed some coaching , but he caught enjoyed game very quickly . 3 ) game still takes long time play . plan taking two hours sitting or putting game aside finish day . 4 ) it more fun more than 2 players . only drawback players eliminated one one ( like monopoly ) , leaving 2 players fighting it out end every game . this means person coming 3rd , 4th , etc ., likely get bored . 5 ) " library " case allows easier storage bookshelf . still , few minor flaws aside , this game classic . i give risk my highest recommendation .	1
i bought ceratosaurus skeleton my 7 year old christmas he sat table all day . he loved finding bones one one . we gave him paint brush wiping away sand he chisels . my husband i can't believe how involved he . he loves dinosaurs , but it activity finding bones makes this worth money . he already asking more . one note : we big flat box shallow sides took one side off put it kitchen table . it great summer outside activity	1
we got this sewing machine my 10 year old daughter christmas . kit comes materials make skirt handbag . we handbag , my daughter fun doing it . she felt great sense accomplishment sewing her own bag ! i help her through project though . this definitely item requires some adult supervision ( patience ! ) depending age child . i would not buy this child any younger than 8 or 9 . my 10 year old young enough she fun it , but old enough she grasp basic concepts sewing using machine . i go step step her through directions , but included patterns not overly challenging . i am somewhat experienced sewing machine , so someone little no experience might find this toy nuisance . overall , machine itself seems well made easy use . it comes foot pedal power supply . my only complaint there no light . even well lit room , we found it difficult see our work area . i found desk lamp basement we set up next machine . overall , fun toy older child .	-1
this game i play my kids or alone my husband - we're all hooked . it simple quick learn , without lot gimmicks you find other prepackaged card games ( " no , mom , floppit only go quirzy pile when it gorpin turn otherwise you pass limburger . " ) i like skipbo because kids often win , not because we're letting them but because they've got better hand , better luck , better strategies ; whatever . you don't feel like you're letting them win - it happens naturally . then they feel naturally smart , or lucky , gloat hours . if adult win , kids usually accept it fair square . my only complaint this game there thousand cards come deck . shuffling no simple matter me , small-handed person . i generally separate deck into two piles , shuffle those , then shuffle them together best i . but it impossible kids their own , makes game setup little tedious very beginning . skipbo flexible you choose play full 30-card game ( takes while , so bring snack choose comfy cushion ! ) or quicker game only 15 or even 10 cards . you play two players or more , though i recommend using fewer cards more people because otherwise game take forever - not entirely bad thing !! why it low-tech , deceptively simple games toys ones we keep coming back time again ? invest ten bucks this game or buy someone set birthday present . you'll thanked many times over form kids asking politely if they cream you once again ... :-))	-1
ever since i little girl i loved this game . not only kids enjoy this game but adults too . my family still plays this game every time we get together youngest us 21 ! i love fact this game strategy component it not just based luck . i'm always edge my seat planning my next move . my family i introduced this game several friends over years they've become just hooked we . it always " just one more game .

considering overall age this game it still quite entertaining . graphics acceptable replay device let you see what happened fairly well . would nice playbook or function see diagrams larger longer than play calling mode . i play against computer allow game generate action so i don't use all keypad responses . it takes bit time get grip strengths weaknesses teams 1994-5 but game consistant when certain matchups repeated . all all it not too bad	-1

if your child enjoys acting out thomas friends episodes , gordon one main characters . he senior member engine team , his job pull express full important people around . gordon boastful sometimes , he wishes he could only pull coaches never pull freight cars , but he use his strength help thomas other engines out jam . you might want get gordon fact he express engine , but i would also recommend getting him because he help other engines whenever they get into jam	1

i love this game ! although it doesn't teach much horses themselves , players learn different disciplines . very cute pictures horses ! like herd your horses , this deserves classic horse game you play again again horsey or non-horsey friends . use strategy determine which horse enter into which class which accessories . ' horse show ' takes little while learn , but after it moves quickly . if i could change one thing this game , i would put information personalities , talents , etc . each horse backs cards , like herd your horses . but it fun make up personalities , breeds , experience levels other things horses pick your favorites . if you're looking exciting horsey game play , try ' horse show '	-1

i am sick writing online reviews , but i feel obligated write this one because knex 50 model set too amazing me not give it credit . my son 7 ; we lots knex sets , lego sets , every kind construction toys you think . 50 model set totally amazes me ! clever design simple engine , catapillar crawls ( not roll , crawl , just like catapillar ) , turtles " swims " across floor , shark opens closes its big scary mouth , fish flaps its tail , bird flaps its wings , helicopter propeller goes around , course , truck runs . it ingenious ! i am frugal parent , i think $50 lot money , but this set worth it . it like getting 50 toys , except child gets build them himself , so there lot more " fun hours . " instructions great ; my son built most advanced level structures never required my assistance . all construction toys i own , i'd say this one best ! buy it please ! p.s. please don't get knex pirate ship park . i got it because it sale , even though it low ratings . piece junk doesn't work - stupid design . i don't know why , it same company , but i suppose all their designers aren't created equal	1
it frustrating try put pegs board . whenever you put them , they fall out .. peg board shape not fit size peg properly .	-1
show new generation fun burp ! works well , shoots straight , great burp sound . easy use reload . balls smaller than normal ping-pong balls , so buy extra balls when you buy gun	1
i read all reviews this product almost didn't buy game until i saw it sale 19.99 toys us couldn't resist . i am so glad i . if you star wars fan ( which i assume you if you're looking this game ) this game must . sure some questions easy but some questions extremely difficult ( but considering fandom obsession star wars even these questions may seem easy ) . prove my point here sample question i though very hard " who darth sidious talking when he says ' i don't want see this stunted slime my site again' ? " most people would initially think nute gunrray but it actually nemodian standing next him whose name i still don't recall . only way anyone could possibly know this dudes name if they studied books . next lot staid repeat questions . game comes 3 decks cards i played game 3 times first set only 1 or 2 repeat questions . far dvds go , they set up 20 games . say you play 20 games before you get any repeat dvd questions . that not extensive scene it games but that still lot questions only 6 films material . overall this game must casual obsessive star wars fans alike !	1
you better know your stuff before you plan purchasing this game make sure you know 2-4 people who know more than they should well star wars universe . some these questions extremely tough there very few easy ones . i used play decipher star wars card game , so my memory those cards actually helped me lot remembering certain characters barely mentioned films . this truly great game we knowledgeable star wars fans finally deserve	1
price , i am quite pleased this product . it used or without headphones . without headphones , turned up all way , there minimal noise distortion . headphones , turned up all way , it not too loud little ears . " play " " stop " buttons easy little fingers operate . my son little bit tough toys , but i expect this stand up his enthusiasm . buy your child cd , record it tape let them listen it their own cassette player ( they can't ruin cd way )	1
my little girl loves music her own cd collection so i thought id get this so she could listen them over over her room ;) this cd player just frustrated her . it doesn't work well , buttons don't always work even when you could get cds play , volume doesnt go up over whisper .	-1
love playing this game ! this great take trip . my husband i rv , we travel lot , this game greatest . this great fun . you not worry pads , pencils dice , just play fun . if you love playing yahtzee , you going love this hand held yahtzee even better !! my husband i fight over who plays next . i need buy one	1
i've mine five or six years i'm quite obsessed it . i've played probably several thousand games it ( high score 738 ! ) , smacked it against wall when its pissed me off , kissed it when its nice , obsessed over hairy dice probabilities , appreciated crisp , functional design every time i use it . only major beef : no " undo " button , so if you hit wrong score mistake you're screwed . luckily seldom happens , this thing more than makes up it number small considerate features built into interface . instance , when you go select where put score , if you make mistake select " full house " when you meant select " small straight , " machine displays score you'll get . so if you see " 0 " when it should " 30 " that good warning change your selection before you hit " score " button . once you hit button you're committed , but least there bit advance warning available . other good : 1 . you use it one-handed either hand , so if you're holding drink or sleeping baby ( or both , it you're type ) , it still playable . 2 . beautifully designed interface , quick learn use , very intuitive . would all handheld games this good ! 3 . very long battery life . i've probably changed batteries ( 2 aaas ) two or three times over six years thousands games . 4 . tough . mine older model ; i don't know if new ones quite durable . but this thing dropped stone bathroom floors ( ricocheted off walls ) more times than i remember it still going strong . few buttons become touchy age use , but this price i absolutely no complaints . highly recommended	1
mcfarland toys pretty good job rendering elvis which difficult thing because his features not easy capture evidenced so many poor looking elvis dolls out there . this doll very much captures elvis action movie completes set i so far .	-1
we got this game 10 years ago , i've just brought it out basement so we begin playing again . ( i'm board game enthusiast house ... but my husband coerced into playing once while ! )for those unfamiliar , outburst " blurt out " game comes 800 topics ( 400 cards since they're 2-sided ) , 6 blue pass chips , card viewer , sand timer , two dice , scoring device slides . object game reach 60 points before other person or team . one die features numbers 0-9 while other green die 1 , 2 , 3 it . players roll dice beginning every turn . blue die refers answer # while green die refers bonus points you get if you happen get particular answer correct . so you may get extra bonus points addition amount questions you correct guess your turn . say , example , you roll 6 blue die 2 green . you then pick card topic words describe police . now , you can't see answers because they're obscured ( kinda like color blind test you take when getting your driver license ) . card viewer red ' decoder ' window helps other person see answers . so let say you answer : fuzz , cops , heat , pigs ( 4 out 10 possible answers ) . they match answers , so you get 4 points . fuzz happens #6 answer , so you get 2 additional points ( 6 total ) . there two plastic sliding " arrows " side keeping track points , so this game very portable . you 3 pass chips you use during game . if you think topic too hard , you pass ... but you must play next card drawn . then , your opponent must play passed card . this sometimes come down psychology because if you think you may awful topic , you decide if person may good it . if they , they really rack up points ! it may better risk only getting few then your opponent getting 10 or more ! not only , you may pass what you feel tough topic , only get card tougher topic ( which happened my husband other night ! ) i really enjoy this game can't wait get newer remixed version ! if you're fan word games like scattegories , taboo , password , you'll likely love this game	1
i am real fan snoopy . i loved see all different roles snoopy plays around monopoly game board . this game fun because you earn monopoly collecting groups snoopy prize possessions . only draw back i there not enough dog bowls ( houses ) , dog houses ( hotels ) , money go around if you playing 4 or more people	1
i just got this figure yesterday local walmart it last one hiding behind all other figures i also found galactic marine but it ripped open all accessories stolen , anyway figure pretty cool it comes figure , blaster pistol , stand , exclusive red hologram figure ( i got darth sidious ) . figure pretty cool , but it should came blaster rifle like commander cody . figure pretty colorful cool blue . add extra detail it few scuff marks legs elbows . shoulder armour , i think removeable i tried but it wouldn't come out when i put helmet back armour loose , so i don't recommend taking it off , unless you want it 501st trooper . but overall this figure fun !	-1
although , yes , questions supposed hard , it not fun if noone ever gets any right ! fun original others some know it others don't . this one takes too long play becasue it takes too long get any answers right . i'll stick my other versions .	-1
my husband i got this game christmas 03 already used all cards . we weekly game nights friends ans everyone loves this game because all questions happened since 1982 . only thing they need more cards this time	-1
batteries lasted 2 days . it center room . even then , images blurry . you would it placed high able see images clear	-1
very cool ! reading some other reviews before i purchased this product i went out purchased some sticky tack put these up but i able cover both my son ( 18 months ) my daughter ( 5 years)ceiling w/ tack they gave me . you don't need bunch huge gobs per star get them stick . i just put few small goobers stuff each piece so far they doing just fine . stickers not great though . when i opened package bunch them fallen off their sheet all over . my daughter fun sticking them back her door though .	-1

bionicles lots fun because they so intricate they kind thing i like . they make me use my imagination because i'll never discover all history they . they're ancient that one main things i like them . they very durable when they put together but pieces very easy lose when they aren't	-1
while color scheme , weapons , spines kraata different , vohrak same his brothers . unless you're talking powers but that story . rest rahkshi , they're first bionicle figures knees bend , which seems insignifigant but trust me , if you bionicle fan or know friend who , this gift get	1
this my first review so bear me . i compelled write it so others wouldn't buy this toy . my younger son who 2 received this christmas his grandparents it truly piece junk . let me count ways : 1 ) made flimsy plastic . 2 ) barn not close completely . also , just few moments ago i " closed " it grey roof fell off when i picked it up handle . all parts came falling out . 3 ) yellow cart doesn't stay tractor . always unhooking . 4 ) hay loft falls off too easily . i'm always re-attaching it . 5 ) animals not balanced . they fall over easily . 6 ) fence comes apart easily . 7 ) when barn " closes " parts still fall out because windows doorway . ridiculous!i'm am so disappointed this toy . don't waste your money	-1
this my new favorite game , although i understand it old game . it like scrabble , but you get change letters middle words make new ones . tiles click onto board so they don't shift around like they scrabble board , they're more securely place . you so much more creative words you make . it more challenge . it also lot easier keep score . if you enjoy magic words letters , you love this game .	1
i really enjoyed upwords once i got used differences scrabble . i think it good game kids when they get little older , too . only reason i didn't give it 5 stars because i wish board little bigger . also , there no cloth bag hold letter tiles , so you really make sure they're all face-down lid while you play	-1
we bought this our son last christmas it broken within 3 weeks !!! this unacceptable any toy , much less one i paid $20 !! page middle switches modes just stopped working no reason whatsoever . my son never broken toy we own many fisher price leapfrog toys . i tried exchange it many many times store never got it back stock . i tried contact vtech via email my email returned undeliverable . it cute idea , especially how song " voice " changes when you touch different animal , but safety issue pig how hard it little ones move sheep , it just not worth it . we bought vtech toy last christmas well ( sing discover piano ) it broke within 2 months . i never buy vtech toy !! there much better toys out there . don't waste your money !	-1
before i start my review , i noticed latest version this toy apparently differs slightly visually than one pictured here amazon . my guess there may two versions this toy out , or one i purchased most recent incarnation . my review this current version march 2006 . short , this excellent toy developing infant , because it provides good panoply learning sound effects songs go blinking lights , functional keyboard learn new music skills . advertising this toy states , ' discovery nursery farm ' many developmental benefit functions , such developing motor skills , visual awareness , language development , imaginative play thru realistic animal sounds nursery rhymes infants love hear . even though our infant only 7 months old ( box it came says it infants " 9+ months " ) , she loves this toy , evidenced her many smiles , giggles , ' razzing ' , overall attention she pays it . we thankfully no issues fingers getting stuck , or other safety issues . perhaps newer version effectively addressed this previous safety issue some reviewers brought up here . addition , ergonomically , this great toy infant who loves spend lot time his/her tummy . toy their level physically , they play it easily while lying down well sitting up , all buttons keys well within their reach . lighter subject singer wee bit ' off key ' , strange voice ( some reviewers mentioned ) , this really ' non-issue ' . fact , his interesting voice sounds kind appropriately goofy perfectly fit fun child toy . then again , compared hearing english language butchered ' raped ' so many times ever since moving state ohio 10 years ago , his voice excellent ! great job ' vtech'!!	1
we this toy less one year both our boys got their hands stuck piggy door . thanks good company like tech they replaced toy . i would definitly tell anyone considering this toy move ....	-1

i looked everywhere truck working wench or crane it . none our local stores one - neither any store internet , except amazon ! my nephew loves it ! this his new favorite toy . we little disappointed crane not motorized part this truck . motorized part crane itself - it rotates . down side this truck crane not strong enough lift most other toy cars . anything heavier than hot-wheels size car too much it handle . but all-in-all great item	-1
bought this my 2-year old grandson . it quite large makes it easy little hands push , pull , tug it around house . plastic construction eliminates cuts , scratches " ouchees " associated similar metal constructed toys	1
my five three year old daughters fought over this store , but three year old won we placed it her room night-light . thing so loud she asked her music turned up so she could hear it above lamp . needless say , lamp only decoration now - no one could actually sleep it .	-1

although , i am sure doll shown photo would delight many girls , doll not one described . description stated she would swim like mermaid , this why i bought this particular doll . when i recieved it , it doll legs cloth mermaid outfit . some how picture product description two different items . i hope this or corrected since my purchase early december	-1

this game so much fun - yes , some songs pretty old , but categories diverse . there traditional tunes like christmas carols , family songs , broadway tunes , tv/ movies most contemporary tunes - i'm pretty sure they maybe late70s - early/mid 90 . if you're 10 years old , you may not recognize much more than traditional - even my three year old knew some those . point you die laughing person who tries so hard hum their tune no one clue ! even absolute worst singer or hummer matter blast this game !!! we play guys against girls - that awesome . my sister 20 she knows most songs - they aren't prehistoric tunes . this game so much fun - you should totally get it	-1
our 6-year-old son just loves this game ! it super easy assemble , easy learn how play , games go fairly quickly exciting . plus it doesn't make all those noises almost all new , electronic toys make . it seems pretty durable well-made we're very happy what we got price .	1
ok , not getting anything else . this game played solo or friend . great hand/eye coordination . great game	1
this sounds like such good idea , but actuality , it doesn't work . sidwalk chalk stencils work fine , but stencils don't work " stomperz . " chalk dust comes flying out these things every direction lands everything * except * stencil you're trying make . your child ends up covered chalk dust ( including up their noses ! ) , but stencil still un-chalked . we so disappointed this one !	-1

these kidkraft sets so fabulous - my four- seven-year-old girls love them ! we bought toaster set baking set . ( look more sets matching kitchen online , they're sooo cute ! ) pop-up action toaster works great . colors really pretty painted finish held up 9-month-old chewing it . my only complaint set i received knife broken velcro one pat butter came off first time we tried " cut " it . both simple repairs - hopefully it doesn't indicate general lack durability . ( you'd think solid wood would very durable ! we'll see ... ) bottom line : great toy , fun play beautiful look . beats chunky plastic stuff any day . i plan buy more	-1

i love this set , my 3 year old who received it last year . make no mistake though ... this real set , not play set . i didn't read recommended age when i bought it ( got it when it sale must too eager purchase it ) didn't realize pie plate ceramic . so obviously 2 year old cannot play it alone . my daughter uses it her play room now she old enough careful it we going try actually bake something it before too long . great grow-with-me set	-1

this esweetie . whole genie magic collection great . seeing theese dolls stores shows you how pretty they . i want all collection . thanks lenzie , you nice !! [ ...	1
iron fist very good action figure . i think he one best this series . his body sculpt appears new one . articulation great joints tight well concealed . paint job details this martial arts master just fine , too . i'm sure it wasn't too hard because he doesn't real flashy costume or anything . but , toybiz stay true his look comic books . i'm very thankful they didn't airbrush this figure death color all light areas shadows-like they past couple series . iron fist comes copy iron fist #8 . it very good giving you glimpse him action what drives him . he also couple plastic " flames " fit his hands simulate his power making his fists impervious ( hence , name " iron fist " ) . they don't fit well , but look nice if you get them stay . my kids don't really use them much , so you take them or leave them . this series called apocalypse series because , past series , 6 figures piece 7th , larger figure-apocalypse . apocalypse 5,000 -year-old mutant arch nemesis x-men . he turns out 14 inches tall he looks really , really good when he all assembled . he best one series . most people probably won't consider character selection this series best , so it good idea toybiz release these figures this fashion . personally , i love character selection idea building , larger figure . they should continue it future releases . everyone want put together their own apocalypse since he very hard get when he made his 6-inch appearance marvel legends 7 . iron fist pretty well stocked , so if you want him apocalypse piece or not , you're still getting nice action figure who plays displays nicely . there version this figure available , but it harder find than this one . ( this one series lots different versions figures ) iron fist red costume instead green head sculpt his mouth opened few tears out his mask . you're not really missing much all if you can't find it . green version every bit good , if not better . only thing missing power man a.k.a. luke cage go alongside him . here hoping heroes hire teamed up soon marvel legends style	-1
this game perfect . works well gives hours fun !!	1
my 4 yr . old daughter got this christmas this year . it great ! best small child game i think . it so easy her follow she tons fun ! i highly recommend this game !!!!	1
what waste both time money ! i bought this jumper after our other , heavier dutier one deflated . what nightmare . it took me hour half just get this item blown up i heavy duty electric air pump . all individual compartments ( octagons)were real pain they not stay inflated , because valves keep popping open when my daughter goes jump . even after if secure them , pushing them all way inside ! not only , bottom portion not strong material - it never fully inflated like you see picture . it these indentions which i believe due shape item itself . picture jumper very deceiving !! not good buy any amount money !	-1

when my son first wanted this toy , i thought he silly . he loves this thing , he seven . first i thought noises this toy made annoying , but after seeing actual baby panda t.v. , hearing it , they sound exactly same . whimpering little noises it makes sounds just like real baby panda . if i hadn't seen this animal planet , i would thought this toy annoying stupid . he blinks , sucks , makes cute baby panda sounds . he even moves his paws . he some mechanical noises while it gears run during leg movements , but other than , it adorable . my son loves taking care " baby he saw animal planet " , likes interacting it . it easily shut off switch his back , his skin baggy enough his back , we open velcro back there when not use , we store panda bottle his back skin . it fits perfectly back there , ready used when you switch him back , you just open his back velcro his bottle ready too . it good way not misplace such small item . we this item since it came out last year , it well loved .	1

1 . what purpose this seat ( seats like these) ? seats like these marketed " infant positioning support " or similar . intent help you teach your child sit up . it tool you use while your sitting your child floor . you shouldn't leave infant side when they these seats , because they liable tip over . directions state seat should placed solid surface , so you need there keep your baby tipping bumping his/her head floor . you don't want use this seat table or any raised surface . you cannot use it your bed , because unstable surface cause it tip right over . 2 . when would i use this seat ? i'm sure you sat floor your baby supported your legs . maybe you used couple pillows help you support your infant . this seat same thing . if you want feed your child infant cereal this seat , remember set seat floor -- never kitchen table . 3 . my child right developmental stage this seat ? there very small window which you would use this seat . it approved infants 9-22 lbs , but i think gives wrong idea . your baby need strong enough " supported sitter " but not developed into " self-sitter . " i'm getting these terms gerber infant cereal box . " supported sitter " hold his/her head up his/her own . i don't know any 9 lb babies " supported sitters . " " self sitters " too strong these chairs . " self sitters " likely rip off front pummel and/or learn flipping thing over gets big fun reaction out mommy .	-1
my baby loved this seat ! it perfect 4-7 month range when babies they aren't content lie around anymore , but can't yet sit up . fun feeding , reading books , playing teething toys more ! design genius - no cumbersome straps once . i love unobtrusive green color ..	1

paintworks produces quality paint-by-numbers kit , this one no exception ... however , i wish they'd package these smaller brush . there no way monster-sized brush useful filling anything but largest sky pieces . you better off ditching brush buying smallest acrylic brush you find . i also bit disappointed size cartoons this one . finished product little blocky which not what i come expect paintworks kit . also , usual , number wear off paint-pots long before you finish piece so you better off getting permanent marker marking numbers bottom pot before beginning . 4 stars	-1

my three-year-old this doll since she 19 months old . she sleeping random baby doll her crib while , but we didn't think much it until we took trip . we didn't bring doll . first night , she cried all night long --" baby , baby , baby . " it pathetic . next day i took her store find baby her . when we entered baby doll aisle , she ecstatic . " baby ! baby ! baby ! " she excited all them , but when she saw this one her reaction different . gasp followed serious , solemn , " baaaay-beeee ... " while desperately reaching it . she tried hug it , still box , all way checkout . after paying i went customer service counter borrow scissors so i could get it out box her right away ! this doll her constant companion ever since . she won't go sleep without it , doesn't like leave house without it . it very , very slightly scented , just faint baby powder smell , which kind nice . you can't smell it unless you're holding it really close your face . it doesn't anything , which actually means it anything since she use her imagination ! doll mouth slightly open which she loves , since it lets her give it bottle or pretend feed it . doll body very soft squishy ( huggable ) , it " beans " its bottom which helps it sit up . it doesn't sit well its own , but it least helps keep it upright doll highchair or stroller . head , arms legs soft plastic very well attached cloth body . it just right size little one hug , hold take care . doll body isn't really showing any signs wear . bit " paint " come off face upper lip where i think my daughter rubbed face into wall ( while sleeping , or supposed ) too many times . clothes ( hers came pink white sleeper ) gotten kind ratty after all this time . i machine-washed them many times they come through okay , but they've now gotten kind pilled velcro doesn't hold so well anymore . i swear i saw clothes this doll store not long ago , but haven't able find them recently . wish i'd gotten them when i saw them ! this absolutely perfect doll little one . there lots accessories it now , too . if we didn't already different doll highchair stroller i'd get little mommy ones so they'd fit doll perfectly . it doesn't sit up well highchair we , it made bigger dolls . i think my daughter probably continue play ( sleep ) this doll several more years , i think doll hold up anything she it . i just hope i find some more clothes it !	1

this car pictured could base or first version defintely not worth 299.00 these going 100.00 less web . if you havent noticed differences packaging it wouldnt suprise me . lots people dont notice . heres differences below ... these 5 cars there two versions each driver(5 different drivers ) made . first versions or base version second versions or " added features " version . first versions no " added features " stickers you cannot race any two ( or more ) cars 5 different drivers ' cars same time ! dale sr. dale jr. , jeff gordon , jimmie johnson tony stewart cars first versions ( no added features ) cannot race together ! transmitter frequencys cannot changed . speed steering straight function .

teething two molars cold croup-like cough over week made my little toddler ultra-grumpy zapped his energy . poor fella couldn't even play blocks or puzzle without falling pieces frustration . i going buy 100 balls put his baby pool summer , but this whole thing sale less expensive than pack balls . he shuffles around , rolls balls down ramps , dunks them through rings hours . no mental challenge , no frustration , it doesn't zap all his energy . it made same weak plastic 99 cent beach ball made out overnight whole thing visably less inflated -- wish it little more substantial . sides not sturdy sit or used pull-up . 31 inches , he barely get out safely . balls inconsistent -- one thick hard next so thin you squish sides full inch . we're not trusting it last long time under everyday wear tear . our plan store it out way until next rainy day , he sick or worse , if mommy gets sick ! no need air pump . two us huffing puffing we got it inflated under 10 minutes . take note some these ball pits free shipping -- shipping this cost more than sale price	-1
only thing " deluxe " this addition glossy foil cover box , which designed make you think you getting something special paying more money . nothing could further truth . this edition screams " cheap " second lid comes off . let go thru hype above set record straight all " deluxe " features : board quad-fold affair , redesigned presumably allow smaller , less expensive box . it much less rigidity than single-fold board " classic " version . when it left out extended period time , especially overnite , ends board curl up refuses lay flat . houses hotels completely featureless , just small blocks wood . they looked dipped some type vegetable dye rather than painted . this probably attempt eek out few extra cents corporate profit . " bankers tray " " property wheel " flimsy plastic jokes . neither would last under play children much more than few games . this edition sad legacy great game , cheapness set detracts joy play . additional cost , all you really getting fancy foil cover one extra play token , plus board curls up edges : whoopee ! my advice : save extra money buy " classic " version .	-1

start button too difficult even three year old hold down . battery tedious re-charge ( required after every use ! ) . dangerous . when child leans slightly side entire engine turn over . all your time money you only see child bored expression - or frustrated child who can't operate start button alone . you could tape down button then child must ask you stop it . total supervision required any way you look it . real expensive , gimicky toy !	-1
it never worked - period . not even second . get disney fish - it doesn't look real but least it works .	-1
i bought this my son fourth birthday because he superhero nut . it cute toy except one critical flaw : it doesn't come anywhere near fitting around waist my average-sized 4-year-old ( wears size 4t ) . i'm talking three inches waist gap even smallest setting . yet belt adjusted size would fit teenager . if you 9-year-old who loves running around batman costume , go it . my 4-year-old , he still plays it sometimes , but we keep it him pair firefighter suspenders . update : thick plastic belt now ripped halfway apart . we've only it two months , he hardly played it abovementioned reasons . not so great batman , but perfect playing super chintzy toy man	-1

features this toy cute , just not planned out very well . my boys love music bubbles , but micky goofy go up down sides broke off after couple days . voice recorder very hard work because short cord . ride my boyslike radiio flyer retro rocket more . overall , our house this bubble machine .	-1

i support comments others make : this game so poorly designed , it laughable . i cannot imagine designers or writers even sat down play game once . forget trying follow directions ; they left out many important rules . board doesn't work , especially way pieces fit into it , what terrible ending spinner doesn't even work like spinner . what up ? forget this game	-1
i'm sure this would fun toy , but us it didn't last long enough find out . we this our pool 5 minutes one guns stopped working . boys very disappointed ! i taking this back store tonight try exchange it new one hopefully works	-1
this very cute set however , it not very well made holders free-standing so when ball knocks against it they fall over . regular croquet wires pushed into ground so you don't problem . kids . . . stands knocked over frequently so you run over set them back up order game continue . i wouldn't buy this set again if i it over . disappointing	-1

this new low , even our feminazi-drenched anti-culture . whole message this whore doll tell impressionable little girls superficial , arrogant , shallow slutty positive attributes , desirable healthy , contrast , true strength character , integrity , honor modesty ' losers . ' other words , looking behaving like skank tramp = " empowerment . " term so misued over last 30 years ( particularly last 10 ) , it ceases any truth it whatsoever . barbie used epitomize what it meant feminine , lady , fulfilled -- husband , home children . now standard completely perverted ruined onset dolls like this -- exchanging true values ( good wife mother ) false ones ( materialism promiscuity ) . even barbie face uglified -- grossly overdone mascara/eyeliner collagened-out lips -- resembling those hideous whored-out bratz dolls . realize -- this war our children souls ! mattel should ashamed themselves , hilt . this child abuse , pure simple . any mother who allows their child get one these monstrosities should jailed neglect her tubes tied	-1
ok , i don't this doll , i won't buy this doll ... if i ever little girl she never anything like this . i saw some girls saying how doll appropriate 10-13 i almost fell out my chair ! this doll -in-appropriate someone under 21 ! short skirts short tops . how heck mattel think this good idea ? i'm 23 years old i would never dress like nor would i allow my child dress like . bottom line : shame you mattel !!	-1
toy makes extremely loud animal noises , screeching motor when backing up or top speed going forward . my son enjoyed heck out it 2 minutes before my wife said it going back store , which exactly what i thinking . least 3-4x louder than any other toy i've ever seen , let alone purchased . also when performing its " flip " maneuver , it gets stuck 70% time then makes same screeching motor sound while it repeatedly tries reset its " flip arm " . might okay just outside use if you stand lot high pitched noise . controller extremely toddler friendly compared other rc toys . toy also seemed fairly tough .	-1
i agree first two comments . we went check it out after my 4 year old saw it tv liked it because bear glasses just like him . product seemed decent store , so we bought it . he only played it once or twice since christmas . only time he fun it when i got mad yelled thing because it wouldn't what it supposed . save your money don't buy this junk	-1
just what world needs , clone worst board game ever sell like hotcakes . i not think any reason recommend this game . winner determined luck , there no skill involved winning this or any game monopoly . game hardly fits into single evening play , few unlucky players who exit early means either sitting around watching or finding something else ( this may blessing if it means not playing anymore ) . so anyone who buying this play it ( not because you huge dog fan must own everything dog it ) i recommend you look into better product . i would start going google searching " board game " . follow 1st link you find	-1
i purchased this my sons birthday this year . he three . he so excited play tent but when i took it out box started put it together i noticed stitching not straight missing some places . it took him no more than 24 hours brake it . plastic supports cheap fabric horrible . there also center support pole no place put it . he likes it but quality craftmanship zero .	-1
i bought this christmas present my 4-year-old daughter . she huge my little pony fan . ponyville lives our house fact . we got it out played it couple hours . we didn't problems described hand crank . seems very durable . problem flower zippee goes . pony steps flower open flower then you wind gear counter clockwise close it . after couple hours , flower petals now broken can't repaired . toys certainly don't quality them they used . hasbro quality general declined . this demonstrated newest my little pony castle well . this toy some neat features . crank works well braiding mechanism useful . breezie lives flower goes story my little pony video series . colors vivid bright . i would liked suggest pink stage daffidazey stands should built-in storage hold hair accessories . some additional clips would also nice addition this set . 4 clips set designed all your ponies ' hair bit skimpy . braids nice tight even young child operate this toy .... bit assistance . ( hint : putting suction cups or velcro hook loop bottom makes it even easier little ones play minimal adult assistance )	-1
i bought this product my children because it looked neat ! what they don't tell you paint must diluted before you use it ( why not include pre-diluted paint ? but i digress .... ) . even after thinning paint , product hardly spins . if we could get it work , it seemed like neat concept . but it just doesn't work . i no idea if it because it needs very thin paint or motor weak or what . we returned ours refund	-1
my stepmom bought set these each my three kids ages 12 , 9 , 6 . all i say not buy these !!!! my six year old great first page but other reviewer said film gets all over markers . we even tried washing them off it no good . also when my 6 year old coloring he would rest his arm bottom page when he would pick it up it would covered black . bottom line 30 minutes after they got them my kids arms faces covered black smudges my hands somewhat just holding their pictures look them . messy messy messy . my 12 year old finally just went stuck one papers under running water washed off all black see neon underneath this proved least messy but least rewarding way it . good idea bad execution . my kids who crazy any kind arts crafts hated these things . save your money buy regular papers markers crayons	-1
start , description this kit false . there not 75 pieces ... only 11 . detail very , very poor ... large soft-edged raised blocks only vaguest resemblance death star seen films . you'd honestly better off starting smooth plastic ball making death star scratch , rather than buying this kit .	-1
barbie plug play 12 dancing princesses thing joke . my daughter only wanted christmas three months . after one christmas morning not function all , second one so terrible she gave up after two days . graphics straight 1981 " dancing princesses " even make roboty bendy noises they move . very strange disappointing	-1
santa gave this our daughter this year . i am thoroughly disappointed it . we put batteries started it up . after reading how part , graphics terrible . i prompt her which flower step , not necessary . princesses started dancing without stepping flower , it just made funny sound . dancers go fast fuzzy . you can't tell sure what foot work doing ballroom steps . i even went mat " tried .

others stated dvd mini-games nearly impossible play due wonky controls . i also no idea what cards or pieces , other then they may come into play if you " win " main game . they should just choose your own adventure type game . it would less high-tech , but you could least laugh when you choose " set up perimeter " terrorists once again escape . not buy	-1

back day ( 1970 ) these made stiff , strong plastic , rigid " insert " w/ poly-rope outside . this gave " leash " realistic , " tight but curved under own weight " appearance , believable / realistic " bounce " " dog " most imperceptible wrist action part " dog walker " . however , this piece crap thick soft wire inside leash , this gives leash very phony , fake-looking , too-heavy , all bent-up look . piece junk piece junk piece junk !	-1
there many significant shortcomings this interactive dvd game . i not recommend it all . it not all like real feud . most frustrating shortcoming you must get answers right order , since it reveals them order , or you lose . no steals , no strikes . sadly , i can't return it since its dvd game	-1

my wife i purchased videonow xp interactive video system my son this christmas however when we walmart out headphones . well i amazon one day decided look here . i ordered them seriously disappointed when they arrived . my 5 year old son attempted put them all they fall his shoulders . no matter how we tried all they would . my 12 year old daughter decided try them her mp3 player same result ! i am able wear them however even my 30 year old head ( size 8 1/4 ) it still loose . these not adjustable which course makes things all worse . i would just go ahead pick up some other company aftermarket headphones your child . if tiger reads reviews their products all then they need ensure they rethink engineering this device	-1
we looked trash truck our 4 year old boy could play . surface , bruder looked part . not cartoon-looking some , fact it looked like real trash truck but few obvious breakable parts made it seem like ideal choice . actual play testing though shows this product isn't very well-built , least not enough withstand normal wear tear . this truck wasn't subjected thrown down stairs , jumped , etc . it just played , but it started coming apart quickly . hinged door back truck poor design . plastic hinges truck too thin , break easily . plastic hinges door start bend after multiple open/closes , plastic weakens breaks off . hinged front compartment rear sections difficult operate , stick easily . items put into cab ( like essential green army man who drives truck ) easily get caught here very difficult remove . worse though key point this toy , ability latch trash lifting/dumping mechanism . this way complex child , intricacy getting solid connect difficult even adult . if it not hooked up right , falls off when you try lift it ; very frustrating . some little pieces ( rear view mirror , etc ) broke off easily early , but we kind expected this . parts simply too small fragile last long . i don't hold this part against design ; part attraction it looked like real truck , i don't think there easy way add small details without some fragility . while this orignally one my sons favorite toys , he can't really play it way he'd like . while he still enjoys driving it around house , he can't pick up trash dump it without adults help , that shame . price , i expected so much more .	-1
this item looks great theory , but it just isn't worth it . pegs made all different sizes - some fall out , some don't fit , some stick out too far , leaving you messy look your lite art . one crayons neon broken when received , but it didn't matter , since it just looked like regular crayon drawing black paper anyway . if you buy this item , sure purchase 25w light bulb isn't even included	-1
kids got it christmas , it looked like fun . however , one we got doesn't work all . i'm not sure if we just got bad one or if this problem common , but i can't even get it turn without changing batteries , then i can't get it go into game mode . plus , rules electronic version different , you lose all your points if you keep acting out words . i prefer rules old version better . i'm planning return this get old version	-1

this paint brush globs out paint , doesn't spread make any kind picture brush barely holds any paint . we went through both provided things paint five minutes no picture show it . not mention bottle small brush fit so when paint half way down you can't get brush it suck paint up . i am so disappointed	-1
we purchased this our daughter after she loved original ballet version so much . i expected same quality original product very disappointed . mat very cheap flimsy my daughter broke headset trying get it her head	-1
these figures look pretty decent first glance but when you take them out box you see how bad they really . my superman broke half ( waist ) when i took him out box ! add fact there only average six points articulation each ( only three wonder woman ! ) you see these aren't very high quality figures . amazo transparent , which makes no sense whatsoever . he isn't invisible character . i also don't like , while superman belt stick out his uniform , bizarro merely painted . only buy this item if you love doomsday its sale . it not worth its list price long shot	-1
we bought this game yesterday our daughter . dolls very difficult her dress . we it her . also , two dresses torn already after playing game only 4 times . she loves game princesses , it teach memory , but it could made much better .	-1

purchased this 3 1/2 year old boy . hesitant buying any large , plastic truck , but we not see any alternatives time we purchased this . we should stuck our instinct . when it arrived , we immediately struck fact plastic seemed flimsy , many small plastic pieces attached grader appeared felt so cheap flimsy we doubted they would survive 5 minutes play , our humble opinion . we not going wait find out , we decided send this back . you get steel tonka 18 " grader off ebay less than what amazon asking this plastic thing . that exactly what we . good luck	-1
my daughter almost 6 we got her this christmas . commercials made it look really cool easy kids , no more scissors ! well we opened it today it too hard her hold button down any amount time move it around slowly enough actually cut anything . i'm it all her my hand gets tired too ! they should made it " pen " cuts when just pushed paper or something . i 9 year old also trying use it it wasn't all easy him either . seems more like something teens or adults scrapbook would use	-1

i just bought this game tried 3 hours make it work 3 different t.v. sets - no luck . i can't even give it 1 star because i don't know how fun it ( or might ) . i tried every " input " available every t.v. , i tried changing batteries , i tried hooking it directly t.v. well thru vcr dvd player - nothing worked . i guess i know why it only cost $5.99 .	-1
don't buy this unless you plan attaching remote your forehead duc t-t ape ; if you lose remote you cannot operate moon . moon also automatic time it comes ; it supposed when it gets dark , but it comes way too early any good , because nobody their room early , it only stays 30 minutes . when it comes itself , ( because its too early ) you barely notice it .	-1

after returning three defective tonka hands power shovels , ( aka crane , ) we decided try different piece machinery brought home dump truck . so far dump truck doing fine . it not exciting crane or digger , but it work seems holding up . my son loves turn it amp ; it quot ; followquot ; him around room . however motor strains , truck moves very slowly , so i'm concerned load too much motor . he likes loading action front end shovel into dump bed , dumping bed . he disappointed it doesn't steer like crane , but only goes either forward or reverse . but working toy better than non-working toy , i'm hopeful this one keeper	-1
i think this doll incredibly fun beautiful , but somehow tail broke off very first day my 4 year old daughter played it . she loves it anyway , she insists . she just screamed pleasure after seeing hair turn purple tattoos appear after 3 minutes freezer . i don't know how it got broken , or how rough my daughter might , but it seems strange it would break so quickly . disappointing	-1
my son loves cars trucks so this looked like it would big hit , but like other reviewers , we put this toy away because all injuries . he used handle push it , but toy unbalanced , so any pressure back causes it flip up hit him face . he several big bruises one cut lip . since posting this , i've spoken rep little tykes . she said they would look into this toy bit more sent replacement toy my son play until he able ( if ever ) use dump truck again . if you've problem this truck , please call them so they get it record	-1

i bought this carry case my son l-max . it works well carrying unit all games he it . i wouldn't advise dropping it hard surface any sort . it not nearly padded enough carrying hand held gaming unit any sort . my son likes take his l-max school him mornings before school begins . i place it carrying case then place carrying case inside his backpack give it some extra cushioning . if i known how little padding there this particular carrying case i probably wouldn't bought it . there carrying case out nintendo wii similar style but much more padded . i almost purchased it but then thought i should get something designed leapster l-max . if i it over i would purchased case wii . it might little big but extra padding would made up it . overall , it not bad purchase but money you should get something little more protective . after all , leapster starts $69.99 price goes up accordingly l-max	-1
it almost impossible turn times . instead moving one right , you go three left , or fiddle it so it lines up properly . you still solve cube but it gets annoying when it doesn't move way you want it . i hoping it'd better cause it really cool it fits your pocket . it just too hard turn . i ended up breaking thing trying get it turn one way . i cant put it back together cause one pieces missing . i really like this product ( i'm buying one ) , i just wish it wasn't so stiff . maybe they made it stiff so it wouldn't turn your pocket but if you know how it , you finish rubik cube 5 minutes , max , so i don't see need prevent it turning . apparently they thought people would solve like half it finish it latter	-1

don't buy this price increased version . i doesn't work any better than $19.95 model . plus it uses twice amount batteries . concept great , graphics great that end it . this just like first plug play ms pacman ( which i also bought ) joy stick issue . if manufacturer would take off games need twisting action joy stick maybe this would actually fun play instead frustrating . while playing ms pacman which only reason i bought these plug plays ms pacman mind her own , turns corners her own runs into ghosts her own . it impossible use joy stick without twisting it during play then you're out control . it extremely frustrating . popular pacman ms pacman their day still these plug plays would sell merit alone so take off games needing turning action joystick	-1

we enthusiastically played candy land each our three kids . it easily best starting point introducing child board games . players take turns drawing deck moving their pieces around board . cards one or two squares particular color ( such red , green , yellow , etc . ) players move pieces ahead path next matching spot same color . no counting or reading required . there also special cards move player ahead or behind , they indicated picture spot board which player should move their piece . play continues until one player reaches end . some my observations : 1 ) most kids probably start playing enjoying this game before recommended 36 months age . if you child attention span desire sit down 10-15 minute game , i'm pretty confident they could enjoy it . 2 ) among lessons our kids learned candyland : taking turns , recognizing colors , dealing disappointment . luckily , games quick enough it usually possible play multiple games one seting . this makes it possible keep playing until each child least one win . ( very helpful managing little egos)3 ) such simple game , it manages perfectly balance possibility changes fortune without seeming arbitrary . game literally doubt until last card played ( one " special " cards might send player back near start ) . this great teaching most valuable lessons : " never give up " . 4 ) most simple games , it almost impossible get older kids play after they reach certin age . we not found true candy land . we've games adult kids ages 3 , 6 , 9 playing together fun . if you more than one kid , you know how hard this . parent three , i give this game my highest recommendation	1
both girls , ages 4 2 loved this	1

since i always wanted " mad scientist " lab when i girl never got one , my husband purchased this my 4 1/2 yr old son i together . overall , it fun . everything but water included which plus . " lab " comes interlocking pieces which assembled variety ways . i like this component because it helps children problem solving , creativity motor skills . kit also comes recipie cards its own measuring spoon beaker . it really taught my son learn how measure . however , recipie cards tend generalize direct you refer other recipie cards , which my son would not able figure out without my help . steps cards come both words pictures which plus but they omitted some details probably only grown up would catch . other hand , " experiments " or recipies go simple gelatin molds bugs more complicated creatures progressively build upon previous experiments . they also encourage creativity giving further suggestions mixing colors , flavors . i also pleasantly surprised how well " experiments " actually tasted toy kit . other hand , if made directed we found it difficult actually fill monster molds amounts directed " recipie " cards . overall , this great gift because it got my son i spend some fun time together	1

bought this our girls , 2 4 . huge hit , even before batteries put blow dryer . this set great several reasons , i'll try list top few . first , dryer actually little fan it whirrs loudly enough seem real , but not so loud disturb cat when she getting her fur . ( uncommon kid toy ) also , nail polish eyeshadow both made open " use " , but no mess . once you removed inner packing materials , bag large enough headband tiara storage . must today princess . one thing i caution you curling iron . if your child longer hair like my girls , it get tangled when hair " curled " . fortunately , curler no moving parts , so tangles discovered long before any permanent damage . all all , pretty sturdy little set $15 . great practice make-overs such , but probably not experienced princesses , there no actual make-up involved , just imagination . perfect my house ! no glittery door handles or perfumed pets !	1

i so glad when my little sister got this game her birthday ! unfortunaty our version wasn't like version i when i young . some reason people stand didn't open or close very well . so while some you could smack down , others you jiggle wiggle get lay flat . not only but when we would start new game , you're soppose able just flip board over all stands would flip out . well red board they didn't flip so well , fact only few would flip up out help . could my fault when i put pieces together . game still fun , althought it hard teaching my six year old sister not exclaim out loud she glad who she got because she likes her hat . although i didn't problem her picking her person instead doing it randomly , ( like you're soppose too ) i still love this game forever .	1
two grandsons ( 4 years 6 years)have truly enjoyed this cartridge . recommend it highly !	1
i got this game my then nearly 4-year-old daughter year later she still enjoys playing it . game very simple not require reading . all parts pieces high quality . it good opportunity work numbers measuring , plus game goes fast so you play it quickly if needed or multiple rounds if you time/inclination . object create tallest character mixing/matching 5 parts ( feet , legs , body , head , hat ) . character pieces brightly colored fun include : ballerina , doctor , fireman/woman , policeman/woman , cowboy/cowgirl , clown . roll die determines which part you select . die both pictures words -- except wild side which printed red . after characters assembled each player measures included ruler ( you choose centimeters or inches ) see whose character tallest . it sliding ruler base so kids actually fit their character inside line up top corresponding number ruler . i wouldn't recommend this game kids beyond 5 -- it may little too simple . but 3/4/5 it great game	1

we recently played bonkers our game club . we read instructions we hoping going bonkers would fun it . bonkers game based asking players questions . questions not trivia knowledge-based questions , but instead word-based questions . instance , question might ask you " come up words end bell " . during your turn you 30 seconds " go bonkers " trying blurt out answers like : barbell ; dumbbell ; doorbell , cowbell etc . your goal would find many answers possible order hit any or all four answers provided game card . every answer you hit , you win scoring chips . just one category questions called add ons - where you find words begin or end certain word . other categories : what blank - where you find words complete blank ; rhyme time - where you find many rhymes possible order match those provided game card ; letter perfect - where you would find words which begin or end certain letters . game play interesting because there some strategy thrown . beginning round , one player ( card reader ) peeks question answers game card decides how many scoring chips each answer worth . so , example above , card reader might allocate 5 scoring chips answer cowbell , four chips barbell , three chips dumbell two chips doorbell . this placing chips gameboard under target answer " " ; " " , " " or " " . object card reader decide which answers hardest place most scoring chips hardest answer . this because if players not hit some or any answers provided game card , card reader win scoring chips leftover advance board . however , if players hit all or any answers game card , they win scoring chips correct answers provided . i really like strategy part game , it adds good deal spice . bonkers provided entertaining evening . we play again !	1

i bought my seven ten year old daughters moon shoes christmas . i read all reviews , so i immediately instructed girls always wear their bicycle helmets when playing their moon shoes . yes , they dangerous , but few precautions , i think kids more fun , safer , parents peace mind . 1 . don't let kids start jumping right away , hold their hand or them put their hand your shoulder they practice walking them . 2 . once they've achieved ability balance , them practice bouncing place just little bit . this help them learn balance they move learn how moon shoes respond way they move . 3 . set ground rules , no bouncing when there lot debris around , no bouncing while holding objects , always wear helmet , no bouncing near each other , if you feel or hear any rubber bands break while bouncing sit down immediately take off shoes . my kids spent first half hour/45 minutes getting use their moon shoes . they now bounce around stability confidence	1

this well thought game . game where players play dvd gatemaster gives you commands , rewards , or punishiments while they playing game . players also watch rules setup instructions dvd . six keys six different types laid out some spaces , your goal get one each type rush center before 49 minutes up . if neither player wins 49 minutes , gate master defeated you . beginning you write down your fears reveal them end which always fun . board six territories . each character owns territory which set same keys . you pick up key landing key space , card telling you , gate master telling you , or winning duel . duel when you land battle space 2 players wager key dice roll see who gets both . there two types cards ... time fate . land skull head get fate card which allows you something certain situation . time card you get if you land clock . time card allows you something if you play it exact second it tells you . sometimes gate master give you power banish someone . when there reward , there also punisment . if you land cursed key , you pick it up whenever you it , you cannot win . if you landed into black hole , you cannot participate until you freed . also , you lose keys . during game gate master says " stop ! " frequently players lisen what he says or punished . all all , it one best games out there well worth money .	1
mother 5 , this toy proven one my favorites all time . my son received it christmas ( age 2 months ) it wonderful . we place it his bed naps night , he goes sleep watching listening it . when he wakes up , it there him play . he grown ( he now 7 months ) , he become increasingly more interested sounds textures toy , now puts corners his mouth which helped teething . i impressed sound quality ( it not annoying like most musical children toys ) i anxious see if it causes my son love music different level . love this toy !	1
this doll cute fun play . my daughter loves it . i like these dolls better then bratz . they need make more dolls dressed way kids . i think lil . im happy my daughter toy i think around long time .	1
i got this yesterday my daughters ( 3 6 years old ) , they like it very much ... let see how long lasts . space kind cramped , but both them fit there few dolls , so i wouldn't complain . setting it up pretty easy , although it almost no stability ( it gets toppled every couple minutes or so ) , doesn't seem take away fun it . however , there couple surprises me : ) product i got very different picture advertisement . it still shaped like castle disney princesses all , but it just different . i am not complaining , my girls like it lot . ) i said before , setting it up fairly easy ( just keep your face away you take it out box , it spring out you very fast ) , but , trying disassemble it putting it away completely different story . , you remove 4 rods ( which not so easy insert first place ) , then , you fold thing away twisting it way only experienced snake handlers would expected able so ( i don't care how easy it should according instructions ) . i tried it 20 minutes until i gave up . , if you don't keep box this thing came , just forget storing it folded , it would like trying keep " jack box " compressed without " box " . think it . so , if you don't mind adding this permanent decor your house , go it , your girls probably like it .	1

we bought my son couple starfighters , tri-fighter , at-rt , wheel bike . he loves starfighters likes at-rt little . he rarely plays wheel bike . i think starfighters just simpler , sturdier , easier play . wheel bike ( smaller extent at-rt ) more complicated , thus less fun 5-year old . we run around mock dog-fights starfighters , but poor old general grievous sits toy box . overall , probably good older kids who more expertly manipulate legs other stuff , but not all fun younger guys	1
my daughter trouble concentrating school . i got this her birthday her grades instantly improved point where her teacher stated there noticable improvement all areas her work . best thing it i don't tell her use it because she loves it . i told her it just like laptop because she always wanted computer her own . this close i'm willing get concenrning her her own computer her age , plus it minute fraction price personal laptop . children who don't hard time school , this may not them but my daughter it whole lot what i needed help me help her learn . i just wish i could find adapter .	1

this pony proved ( princess promenade ) one most popular my little pony we bought . it comes pink skirt , pink crown high heel shoes . most popular item dressing table revolving mirror after several months it still hasn't broken despite harsh treatemnt . pony white silver strands through mane tail . it very pretty but rough treatment really make mane matted very quickly . also , think getting white pony very seriously younger children , while coloured ones drawn pen stains wiped off least partly concealed - white ponys it impossible hide . younger ones ( 3 year olds ) it hard get them not first . desert rose very pretty but now bit stained sorry looking . never less she integral my children games still which nice . one more popular ponies we bought . generally very hard wearing , including accessories , only item which broken crown which didn't last - it too thin got badly bent early	1

i purchased this expansion set , thomas friends water towr figure 8 set , my 2 year old this past christmas . expansion set afterthought , prompted no small part manufacturer promotion running time ( 50% off this set purchase figure 8 set ) . conclusion many initial hours intense playtesting ( ongoing process , no termination sight ) , my son agrees this essential choice any but most basic ( read : boring ) wooden railroad layout . this expansion pack comes switch tracks , allows little train engineers ( their dads ) reverse directions or explore different parts railway . retrospect , i think i would dissatisfied i not purchased this set complement basic figure 8 layout , promotional price or not . far quality , learning curve wooden track made hardwood , more substantial than many other brands compatible track ( i.e. maxim , first learning , etc . ) . this consideration when your child insists taking track apart him/herself put away . we already broken couple pieces generic track this way , since male end connectors bit weaker than rest track . overall , we quite satisfied this set , look forward many more hours enjoyment	1
we bought this set my seven year old boy we bit dissapointed . there better magic kits out there price older children .

i started playing this game it original german version . which , went through some revision expansion decks put out . result , english version may end up little more together you get expansion decks . talk wonderful game play two people ! it absolutely well put together , though certainly different playing than boardgame version catan . it uses same notions , but far more dynamic involvement within game play itself . expansion packs absolutely great , overall add lots options twists play game . it takes couple hours , signicant amount table space . it travels well enough it box , but actually play it you need time lots space . i highly recommend it , especially if you only two people looking game you play fun , involving , certainly full strategy . this one many wonderful games made klaus teuber , i hope he keeps coming up winners	1
i stumbled upon this game years ago , my family enjoyed it -- even my adult friends , who seemed balk first playing kids ' game . this past year , i decided purchase it my sixth grade classroom . i must say ... wow . i allowed kids play it while during homeroom , kids would waiting early outside room get snag frog juice . they would even play it over other outdoor games recess . anytime you heard " noooo !

chaturanga oldest known form chess . it dates back india seventh century a.d. front porch classics carefully re-created this game it now available everyone ! game itself beautiful . it played fabric playing board ( all games once played fabric , it extremely portable cheap , cardboard wasn't even invented until late 1800's!) . unlike chess , game played two four players . each player gets 8 playing pieces , made clay : raja , elephant , horse ( cavalry ) , ship four infantrymen . these pieces kept beautiful velvet bags . each piece loose equivalent modern chess . raja most important piece , much like king . elephant acts much like rook . ship bishop , you cannot capture raja ship . cavalry moves exactly like knight . infantry , which this game look kind like tiny buddhas lotus position , like pawns . big difference chaturanga chess chaturanga played four-sided die ( it long rectangle , instead perfectly square cube ) . die tells you which piece you move . game somewhat easier learn than chess , but easily much fun . game should used teachers parents introduce their children history culture india . rulebook includes lots interesting information india well history game . game comes convenient bookshelf edition , where game kept beautiful book-shaped box looks great any bookshelf or coffee table	1
this first game i've tried venerable reiner knizia . i really taken combination simple rules , but interesting strategy . since then , i've purchased several his games . those who like lost cities , but also soft spot poker , try battleline . samurai great introduction sometimes complicated world " tile games " , tigres euphrates much more complicated cousin ( although again , rules aren't complicated ... difficulty comes via strategic decision making . ) so far , my all time favorite knizia game ... frankly , one my favorite games period , modern art . game mechanics fairly simple , easily explained 5 minutes , some more complex bidding rules explained trial game . essentially , it game playing auction ... who best playing market , guessing art values , spending money wisely . it also true crossover game ... non-gamers , or those only exposed standard monopoly , trivial pursuit , etc , quickly learn how much fun it ... probably asking play again	1

this without doubt best [ ... ] we spent toy our 7-year-old son , but it isn't toy . it highly functional , albeit inexpensive , metal detector . we've it now 3 years take it camping , etc . it easily find something small rusty staple , detect railroad spike far 4 1/4 inches down , very good if you consider how small detection coil . when camping kids love find dig up ancient tent stakes , rusty nails , occasional coin . adjusting sensitivity trivial , just hold it away any metal , turn sensitivity knob until red detector led just goes out . other reviewer noted three-piece shaft breaks easily , which happened ours , but little duct tape goes long way this shouldn't stop you buying one . if you get one , make sure bury some coins other treasures garden kids find . ps it also really works great locating studs plumbing pipes walls	1
my 9 month old son loves this toy ! it easily his favorite toy . he'll gladly tummy time hitting piano keys hitting dial characters . he great time making it go , now sit up scoot car little . his other toys good couple weeks best , this one he only seems enjoying more longer he plays it . music not nearly loud or annoying most toys actually little fun . well worth purchase price	1
pixter fantastic learning tool ages 3+ . parent , i love many learning activities based around drawing creating so child not only gaining knowledge but also creating art same time . my son who 2 few weeks pixter , though he far below age recommendation , he absolutely adores drawing his pixter . he very gentle it it keep him entertained hours . compared leapfrog leapster , pixter many more creativity-based activities leapster tends more arcade-style system . however , leapster cartridges much easier find there bigger selection titles . i plan purchase leapster my son his 3rd birthday because l-max play games tv well handheld . also , contrary popular belief , pixter not discontinued this writing . i spoke representative fisher price myself she said they redesigning system new colors but not discontinuing it or any software . beware when purchasing these games ebay ridiculous prices people claiming they discontinued . wait stores restock after holidays it different story	1

i went online look other little tikes toys handle saw this truck - which my 17-month old son loves - only two stars i wondered why . i disagree most other reviews . handle top makes it easy him push around carry - he run it up slopes , ground , anywhere . he never fallen or injured himself it . fact his frustration occurs because he only pull dump truck end up 50% time . usually he just hands it me , points he wants it open . i agree handle make it difficult put large items back opening end dump truck makes it difficult items fall out . this only reason i'm not giving this toy five stars . but my son loves this truck pretty much playing it constantly since we got it month ago . i'm planning get him train handle because he likes this toy so much .	1

why people purchase toy tikes when it specifically targeted older kids beyond me . always look box minimum age toy best . said , all ltto taggers , including this one , simple " grab go " game called ltag . all you pull trigger twice you're your way . this early manual , way before all complicated games frustrate 6 year olds their parents . i love ltto . i even run club uses it here auburn , wa . but i * always * start new players out ltag , then move up hosted games , then more complicated games . never try start out hosting team hide seek game , ' cus it just too much young or completely new player . but that why ltag game exists ! just grab it play ! no messing control panel . don't take low rating based inapproprate purchase worth much . similarly , take my rating grain salt since i'm huge fan . but kids 8 up adults , ltto taggers wonderful , durable , long lived toy gets you moving thinking	1

if you know movies inside out , this game fun dedicated fan . i play my son knows so much more star wars trivia than i but find game enjoyable . only minor annoyance when you land pie question too many times , dvd portion game runs out questions tells you use question card deck . not sure why they could not load up more questions dvd but maybe game not intended poor old mom answers so many questions wrong	1

if you hardcore family guy fan like me ( i am actually one few people watched family guy when it originally air ) , you not disappointed this monopoly version . box beautifully designed griffin family pictured center , some easter eggs look around . board not most impressive one especially compared simpson muppets monopoly versions but it pretty nice griffins center . what you love board properties , which include everything chris ' closet seamus ' lighthouse james woods high geronimo palace clam channel 5 news mayor west mansion finally petoria , all both old new seasons plus some scenes stewie untold story movie . property deeds somewhat disappointing though . not color watermarks like those found simpson version , but i guess they . peter fishing boat , hinden-peter , peter-copter pope mobile replace railroads . i bet you not laughing too much when you pay $200.00 ( income tax ) volcano insurance or $75.00 workplace sensitivity training ( luxury tax ) but hey , you can't stay mad long salesman guy , right ? it would cool joe swanson go jail space picture quahog prison jail space but well , what you ? pewter tokens nice . you chose tv junkie peter , mug hand brian , nose picking chris , lois , stewie high chair meg ( who looks like peanut character ) . you also order four more tokens include giant chicken , quagmire , joe evil monkey . coolest changes chance community chest cards replaced what deuce ! giggity ! giggity ! giggity ! cards , respectively . they beautifully full color you find things like ; made sheriff bumblescum advance go , get liposuction implants pay $100 , confederate civil war veterans after you go back 3 spaces , take big fat paulie movies favor collect $25.00 , help death get girlfriend collect $100 , many more . money goes follows $1 - meg , $5 - chris $10 - lois , $20 - brian , $50 - stewie , $100 - peter , $500 - griffins there no special rules this version , which weird since it norm some time these special monopoly versions . wrap it up i must say even though they could better job this beautiful wonderfully monopoly game . family guy fans love it making this great gift . fun	1

ms. pac man always my game back day . she just seemed less clunky than her male predecessor . i just received this game mail today after mad scramble eight ( count ' em eight ) aa batteries i got down business . i admit i bought this game ms. pac man , exclusively . here what i found , nutshell : pros : 1 ) graphics sound faithful old arcade game minor exception placement score , lives fruit . no problem . 2 ) old skool joystick . nice touch . 3 ) plug ' play set-up . no brainer . cons : 1 ) i honestly don't mind cords one bit . eight batteries bit logistical problem i don't usually dozen-or-so batteries lying around any given time . 2 ) my main gripe joystick frustratingly unresponsive habit moving ms. pac directions i don't want her go . i understand , however , previous version this game worse this regard slightly improved this version . fair ' nuff . all-in-all neat little contraption every bit addictive it my youth .	1

both my kids got these christmas - great idea ; not expensive dvd player car ( especially those us who don't want portable one/plan get next vehicle built ) picture really better than i thought it would . however , i only got my children two discs piece start . now , no discs worthwhile found anywhere . only ones ever racks/online en masse star wars 3 pack ( none today kids really want ) , tony hawk skate park ( obviously they aren't interested there either ) fear factor ( let face it , if you let your kids watch ff you need take videonow player hit yourself head - hard ) . even if i find couple ebay , selection so limited . i wish i'd just bought cheap portable dvd player . hasbro really missed boat this one - it could great thing but they didn't make enough discs ones they produce need put more shows out kids . my advice : don't buy it . i am very disappointed disc selection - this already bottom toy box .	1

i bought this game my new family christmas . this not all game life i remember playing countless hours child . first all , my old game all mountains , houses , spinner permenantly attached game board . new version , all these things attached each setup , which takes 10-15 minutes they easily knocked off board . also , spinner hard spin frequently comes off its pivot . cars less sturdy people pegs not stay car so you constantly put people back car . finally , rules game gotten more complicated yet meaning game become more trivial . i think i put this top closet or yard sale go find my old version game play future	-1
i got this message recipient mother : he loves it , really ! well-made drawer - shelf design . it heartwarming when he settles down industriously using his art supplies	1
i loved electronic talking battleship kid 1980 anxious recently play this game again . i always excited looking through back play booklet when picking out board . i also always nervous when opposing player would hit red button , firing their missile . you hope they'll miss but you'll get bit nervous once they manage hit one your ships . you also hope they won't sink all your ships before you figure out where their ships . other hand , when you're one pressing red button , you're eager hear crashing sound - hitting one your opponent ships . good feature this game you play someone or you play against computer . when someone plays against computer , one usually loses . but i recall kid beating computer few times so that not case here . all , electronic talking battleship worth money bring many hours entertainment . great investment ! - donna di giacom	1
my 9 year old son just started understand this game , we bought it when he 7 . he would get confused how call out other persons ships . he would say where his ships . this game helps kids understand they need pay attention coordinate where their ships . it depends how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing this game .	1
sorry excellent game working my first second grade boys well my sixth grade girls . boys practice counting reading while everyone lessons sportsmanship . excellent choice	1
concept more or less same standard monopoly . product good worth price . its nice family members sit toghther njoy	1
what makes this monopoly version special large tokens difeerent styles houses hotels . i love how they made tokens bigger heavier . also four different styles houses hotels little variety housing . money holder felt it make it little more fancy then standard plastic course case metal instead standard cardboard box . other than it same game . only complaint i i thought looking tin shelf it silver gld colored tin , but it only siver . gold only plastic around tin .	1
my 6-year old daughter her friend got one these christmas . they love it !!! it tons learning games 5 levels each game . i can't tell you how much this helped her reading writing skills . once you complete level , you get " prize picture " . i've looking all over expansion cards because she noticed they slot them . i no luck . i would highly recommend this product	1
i know alot impressionist already . so getting this game just add my collection . i actually impressed i learned something new . writing explanations pretty simple , because it geared towards children , but i still enjoyed it .	1
i bought this my 5 year old son who loves draw . crayons cheap , compared crayola . we tested 10 different reds searching correct " spiderman " red , but they all looked too pink , pretty much same color . also really waxy . oil crayons terrible , totally waxy - no oil all . markers ok ( so far ) , but why provide two each color same thin tip ? they could given broad thin tip marker each color instead . case seem pretty sturdy , so worst case i'll replace contents better quality art supplies . i'm going look around something better ... if i find it , this going back toys us . any ideas ?	-1
my daughter received this christmas when she 20 months . she loves it !!!!!! it perfect size her she now tall 2 year old . it conveniently one piece very durable . easy clean . you need buy some food pots pans it not come any . highly recommend any little tot	1
i bought this gift my daughter 2nd birthday . she really loves this kitchen . abby reese spends hours hours cooking up storm this fridge . she so imaginitive - i love how it teaches her pretend play . this kitchen very compact - fits almost anywhere . i'd recommend this kitchen anyone	1
my 11 month old son received this christmas . he loves it , goes it more than all other toys he got christmas . easy little fingers , entertaining , great practicing fine motor -- pounding , pushing , turning . little tykes really hit mark this one ! much better than kitchen my daughter	1
this first real toy we bought my son ( other than real baby toys ) , he 6 months time . moment we brought it home , he loved it ! it comes three balls you drop slot they come rolling out - he never got into part even this day but he loved loves hitting different parts workbench hammer hearing sounds seeing lights flash . it also winding crank some other great little features kids love . now he 20 months although it no longer one main toys he plays i see him go over give it whirl here there i still see same excitment his eyes just like first time . i don't know if i'll ever able get rid this toy not because my son so attached but because i am attached memories his very first toy would hate see it go	1
shopping puzzles over last few years i've noticed manufacture age recommendations seem bit off . when puzzles too advanced , simple solution put it up later date ; however , when they too simple , they're waste money . unfortunately , alphabet art puzzle one those disappointments . puzzle encourages thinking , matching , but i'm not sure it helped teach alphabet . addition , some images too goofy this age group . instance , piece rope shaped into letter " , " but 3-year old don't associate such thing . example this , letter " " yarn . wouldn't yo yo better solution ? raised pieces offer new motor challenge plastic knobs , but they too shallow board . i can't seem move this puzzle without dropping several pieces floor . my son found this frustrating well . what more , i think age recommendation needs adjusted . i purchased alphabet art puzzle when my son 2-years 4-months old . it recommended children 3-years up , so i thought it would make good choice . it didn't challenge him all . second time he worked it , he completed it less than 4-minutes himself . said , my son benefited puzzle . he likes working it , continues ask questions pictures . i recommend it children 18-months up , they find it more challenging than 3-year old .	1
this puzzle one best we found age 18m - 3.5 yrs . it now used our second child great condition , very sturdy wooden pieces . it fabulous learning all sorts things - alphabet , hand coordination , new words , you use it play i spy well . it visually appealing well	1
play game itself great -- similar scattergories you'll coming up words fit certain category looking them start certain letters alphabet , but several twists make it even more entertaining . one beef i really this game deck available categories too small -- just two or three games you'll begin repeat categories . so , you may wish augment deck categories your own	1
i purchased this game 5 years ago searching more because all my family friends wanted their own copies ! we familiar fundex toys ( phase 10 ) wanted family game ages 6-86 could play together this game ! rules easy , game never same , everyone fun	1
my daughter loved color pencils sketch pad comes this set . crayons , however , not survive shipping , those broke shortly afterwards first use my seven-year-old . overall , lovely kit , but crayons not well crafted rest kit .	1
grandchild loved this gift . her her friends made tattoos everyone . there so many styles choose they really lasted . would buy again minute .	1
i agree previous review you get what you pay . but future i would highly recommend paying more once instead replace this food few months or so . we received this gift outside it looked like great choice ! i very happy . but we this package food one week i am already taping boxes packaging tape keep them together . little hands pull apart milk , juice snack boxes no time . cans food so small they topple over easily play kitchen . pies , pizza , such food all actually hollow underneath . there no base them . they tell you 101 pieces but our kit it counted 8 hotdogs ( without buns ) , 12 individual french fries same potato chips . not necessary especially since you also get two french fry packets french fry container you get hot dog bun separately . why would my child want four jalepenos too . so much this food not they type thing small child would familiar . anyway , my opinion spend money smaller quantity higher quality food or go online find " vintage " fisher price or little tikes food . now those made last good size small hands .	-1
my daughter 2 1/2 when i gave this her . i use it teach her food groups encourage her taste real version . pretend " invisible " food fun , but little one who lot learn different foods , touch see worth 1000 words !	1
i bought this kitchen my daughter her 2nd birthday . she didn't seem very interested first i just figured it would take time her like it . i showed her how play it how sounds work but she still very uninterested . i think she needs little bit older fully enjoy it . she plays it long someone there playing her . she can't reach top shelf yet gets upset everytime something placed up there . tell you truth my 4 year old sone loves it . he loves pretend cook things clean dishes . this kitchen withstood my daughter climbing all over it , my husband falling it my son standing it . it tough toy ! i love it so small ... it doesn't take up whole room like most other kitchens i love it moved easily . i would recommend this toy anyone who shopping 3 year old or older . i am sure my daughter enjoy it more once she little bit older	1
i purchased this kitchen my daughter christmas . it arrived i started assemble it only find few minor manufacturer defects one pieces compramised way it assembled way it would " wear " over time . i called little tikes ' customer service phone number after explaining problem they said they would send me new part immediately . i haven't received it just yet but they said they would try get it here before christmas . i dissappointed when i found defect certain , one week remaining before christmas , i would difficulty getting someone respond my request help . i spoke nicest man little tikes so impressed how company stood behind it product sent needed part absolutely no hassle ! they didn't require me prove part defective or even return it them ..... they simply took my word it . i am impressed , more than ever , little tikes company appreciates their customers ...... even it they aren't making " large " purchases . this not one their most expensive kitchens yet they still stood behind quality their product !! i'll try update this review once i've recieved new part entire transaction complete .	1
we 2 these toys - they both same problem others - only says " red pan in/out " if you slam it hard floor it occasionally sing , but this also random . fisher-price rep. not seem surprised when i called report this - told me keep toy i sent me voucher new toy .	-1
my seven month old thinks pots pans best thing ever , i'd definitely rather he bang plastic ones than real ones . but i say songs little irritating i find them running through my head when i'm trying sleep	1
reading all reviews different toys it still come down individual child .. my little man got it christmas 8.5 mths .. he like it .. he takes them apart . shakes pot balls it .. he also loves just pressing button .. makes it talk .. overall not bad price ..	1
we got this my daughter 3rd birthday it such hit ! we no issues chalkboard thankfully . it really simple assemble very sturdy . she able use this item many years come !	1
my daughter received this her third birthday . she loves it . i would agree insert chalkboard not work so well . dry erase , however wonderful ! i cannot wait get paper so she start painting next ! i would recommend this three above . there some small pieces height could pose issue smaller children . but overall , great product ! only downfall , they not provide even few sheets paper get you started chalk/eraser etc .	1
we bought this our 10 year old grandson last christmas he loved it . he interested animals he wrote book ' dangerous ' animals . he great time doing it . finished product great . his parents copy book printed seller sent it us gift . we always cherish it	1
great idea ! bound book sweet , not cheesy all , nice quality . makes great gift grandparents . my teenagers even enjoyed making them .	1
my three year old grips these perfectly . array colors make them such enticing reason try learn write . great set markers . really really great	1
very interesting spoof original game . i found first one boring after few plays , but this one still interests my kids i after 10+ plays . it bit convoluted put it together initially , but well worth it	1
this extremely fun addictive game . you shuffle cards , place three ( room , weapon , person ) secret envelope . every room you go into , you make accusations . if someone card you accused ( like room ) , then they show it you you write it down your notepad . game changes constantly , so it never gets boring . character pieces teeny details , like mr. green straps buckles his briefcase . i gave it 4 stars education because it teaches you focus really think . oh , good problem-solving skills too . coordination ( you add all clues up see who it ) . all all , terrific game . great rainy days or playdates . i mention weapons ? very realistic . cute	1
i bought this game long time ago but unfortunately all my friends busy until x'mas . there 5 us once we started playing , we all addicted ! i heard some other friends commented clue boring game , but we all found it fun challenging ! apart strict logic thinking , keys win ask right question make good , well organised notes ! last time we played we 5 players , so some us got 4 cards hand some got only 3 hands . bit unfair because players 4 cards more clues beginning so their chances winning higher . so we tried one game open 3 cards table , game finished lot more quickly . but we all found it less challenging . overall , great game !! train you brain logic thinking much sudoku mastermind	1
my daughter received loving doll house christmas loved it , however our family consist mommy , daddy , girl , boy golden retriever . when i spotted this item i so happy see i could duplicat my daughters real life family . she absolutly loved it . she actually played just dogs accessories 3 days . it hard find stores so i just ordered it amazon/toysrus . it out stock so she not get it until after christmas , but ok she said " more presents " when it came mail	1
varry good board game . i played it first time over weekend . game we like strippopoly 5 stars them bot	1
first time i played this game my co-workers happy hourand then again my family members our summer vacation thebeach house . although we already close " thought " we knew lot eachother-this game only made us closer . i don't remember laughing hardas i once secrets started become revealed . next morning atbreakfast , no one could even make eye contact without laughing ! this game perfect play group friends or family willkeep you laughing all way thru ! it would make perfect holidaygift-i highly recommend purchasing this game if you up somelaughs !	1
i bought this my 2yr old grandson his birthday so he could motorcycle like his grandma . he loved it ! wheels wide enough keep it tipping it light enough just right size throw car take . he make his own " motor noise " , but that plus my book . no batteries replace or noises annoy ! also his very tall 3 1/2 year old brother ride it comfortably , so i look it last long time	1
this little motorcycle cute . however , it very lightweight similar quality ride-on toy could purchased much less any discount retailer . stickers seem high quality date , none peeled off . extreme shipping price added $10 $19.99 price tag . this definately not $30 toy .	1
idog very cute , but he takes long time get going sucks batteries down record time . too bad , because he nice way play your music .	1
i've trying get some sort way listen my i-pod without earbuds . i not going spend $100 bucks boom box just i-pods . so it caught my attention while i herbergers noticed i could listen music through dog . it cute so i grabbed it . you put two aa batteries dog leg . then you just plug your i-pod instant music . sound isn't good stereo system which makes this good me since i live condo not want make lot noise . dog cute its head turns its ears go up down beat music . there also lights go off beat music too . it also cries barks . kinda gets annoying after awhile . it demands attention . if you pull its tail it growls . you control songs volume through your i-pod . this cute cheap way listen your i-pod without spending lot money or lot hassle .	1
shuttle bay door fall off no time . booster rockets next . ability stand it up launch pad last few days best . robot arm cheap garbage . this my experience 4 year old boy , but it applies all ages	-1
this more costume item adult or older child than toy young child . there only two working buttons , one open visor one repeats single message through crackly speaker . there some padding top , but not enough . manufacturer acknowleges this including note suggesting more padding added . overall not good value all price .	-1
my twin boys ( 16 months ) love this toy . i would suggest getting least 100 extra balls . ( i 250 our ball pit it really looks fun )) connections aren't best , but they work better than other company models don't velcro straps . our kids play this off most day . cautionary note , this fairly large system tunnels tents so make sure you plenty room . course , you use pieces separately make several smaller play spaces instead one large area . overall , i am glad i purchased this i didn't wait until recommended 3 year old age range .	1
what bunch junk ! upon opening megaland , i noticed it ripped seam one area . this pretty large rip i might add . after inspecting it more i noticed dozen more places where it ripped . i noticed parent said same thing . now i know why it half off ! don't waste your money .	-1
it good toy but balls rather small youmust check seams when they arrive poor sowin	-1
we bought this shopping cart my daughter birthday replace cheapie one she'd before . her previous one cost under $10 ( gift ) there no comparison one little tikes one . old one flimsy get go , faded quickly , when it broke , left sharp edges plastic . little tikes cart much , much sturdier safer . i put it together less than 30 minutes , even my daughter ' help ' . there nice deep basket holds good amount pretend play food or whatever else your child wants push around . seat doll folds against cart just like real shopping cart , easily holds good variety different style dolls . empty shelf under basket nice touch , perfect stashing more groceries . this cart definitely worth extra money , i'd gladly buy it again	1
without doubt , this best shopping cart available ! 1 . sturdy2 . little seat baby doll- easy get baby doll out it makes it more like real thing . 3 . holds ton food . both our kids , 26 mo . girl 15 mo . boy love this !	1
i bought it my niece , she love it , play it instantly . i not buy accesories because she use any single toy she put it	1
we got this cube before my son born . he enjoyed playing it since he very small . first he would just look it , then he started moving flap bullseye now he grabs all different parts it really manipulates it . different rings sections grab make this great toy child learning reach . my son now six months old he still enjoys this toy	1
our 3 month daughter loves this toy . it multiple shapes colors visual devlopment enough different textures keep her busy while i write this review . very good product	1
it very educating entertaining toy ; my baby only 6 months old he loves it ! he shakes it scratches it !	1
i came across this item accident while doing my christmas shopping yesterday . not only am i sure my 6 year old son love this ... i love it ! lol ! it really cool . you push top it pops open while wings shoot out . there flashing lights sounds . you put any number codes all beginning bat access games activities . it keyboard it just like real laptop which i am thrilled . now my son type his computer instead mine ! lol ! i played it myself probably half hour . sure there some things he wont able but it wouldnt much fun if he already knew how it . it definately something him awhile . only small complaint i would screen could bigger . size top laptop actual screen used very small . i dont see why they could not utilized more screen still room list bat codes . either way , i am sure any batman fan would love this , any little boy love this ... any mother who looking cool , fun , educational toy love this ! best part me lights you turn . there probably 2 or 3 settings lights help you see screen so much better . great feature well wings which dont really add much except it make any young boy think he something batman might actually use ! i totally reccommend this " toy " anyone boys ages 5 7 or even 8	1
my two little girls , 2 3 years old , love this table use every day . i bought it month ago it still their favourite toy . they love it so much they want eat their meals it also . it expensive but well worth money . i love fact there enough space benches their friends sit create . table also large enough each child their own drawing space	1
my daughter adores dora asking this toy . she received it christmas thrilled . i love it because it very sturdy toy . babies heavy duty plastic dora half plastic , half cloth . my daughter sleeping dora . she enjoying pretending feed babies put them dora carrier . this toy great play acting well wonderful if you trying get your child ready little brother or sister , although you might want educate your child they won't able carry their new sibling around carrier like dora until they much older	1
my daughter 2 1/2 she loves dora . she loves playing dora babies	1
let me just say this : my 4 year old certifiable dora nut . she loves her . you could give her bag dora it she'd think it cat meow . but , i must say , mom-mom came through big this toy her 4th birthday . she loves dora feeds twin babies bottle attached her hand . she loves little song dora sings big sister when she presses dora hand . she already singing it around house . feeding accesories cute durable well twin babies themselves all too cute themselves . also , since my four-year old daughter twin well - she twin brother - i think she really relate this toy level well . great toy	1
unlike all bad reviews this doll , i want say how wonderful this doll she everything it says box , i know lot people says she doesn't cry but she it takes while if your child plays her lot feeds her right way she cry , our doll cry every time my daughter squeezes her hand , even my 8 year old son loves make her cry , it over all great doll my daughter dresses her different outfits take her everywhere she goes ...	1
this best kitchen out there . my kids it year now . ( 4 2 , girl boy ) they love it . they play it everyday . we tons kitchen accesories they all fit . freezer one open space , fridge one shelf , stove one shelf pantry one shelf . so this doubles your storage too . my husband put it together , no problems . i must add ... box came very damaged ( it very heavy i guess ups guy wasn't happy ) . it ended up 4 major pieces badly damaged . i called kidkraft they sent brand new pieces ( big sides ) no questions asked !!! so top off great product great company .	1
my girls love this kitchen . they play it everyday . it lot storage so you store play food , dishes , etc	1
i bought type fridge attached . my daughter loves it . i researched kitchen sets well , this far most reccommended ! love it love it love it !	1
i bought this my 5yo daughter . it actually one better dora games i've seen . runs very similarly television show . offers little bit more spanish than show . it probably tad ' easy ' side its age group though my daughter didn't find it particularly difficult , but didn't phase her interest any . it now become one her favorites smile games	1
i needed kitchen my 3 yr old daughter would fit into very small space ... but one enjoyable play . we received it very quickly , time her birthday , although she not played it yet ; i test run it it seems made very well ; especially price . it small but many different little areas she work either slide out or open up . it would probably difficult more than two children , max , really play this same time ( again b/c size ) unless they some other accompanying toys like table chairs so one child could chef others could help preapre food table or customers , taking turns , etc ... tipping over part reviewer mentioned , hers against wall ; i think most people their toy kitchens so i dont think would problem . all ; good basic kitchen great price	1
my 3 year old my 1 year old play so nicely together this toy . my only complaint it could heavier bottom ; it toppled over couple times . otherwise , it great ; they love ' burners ' which make noise light up . i bought some more accessories because there not too many included	-1
after surveying lots kitchen sets , i decided buy star kitchen my kids( 1.5 1.2 years old ) . it turned out great choice . my kids love it , i love it , too .	1
set great rule book refreshed my memory . item not come color shown . i wanted pink one i got red taupe set . kind disappointing	1
i bought this my 3 year old daughter . she loved it store i thought it cute . i also agree other reviewers there should instructions stickers , but you don't need genious figure out where they go . i chose not sharoen pencil because she 3 i didn't think it necessary . twenty dollars it good buy . i know my daughter loves it lot fun it	1
overall this nice toy . my daughter loves animals if your child this would one they would enjoy playing over over again . it comes everything you need care puppy . puppy soft very huggable . only thing i would suggest it should come small bag keep all pieces . my daughter ends up throwing all pieces into carrier dog it they jiggle spill out sometimes when it carried around . it would also help avoid losing those small pieces . other than , we love it	1
i always thought clue looked like complicated game i'd never touch ! until i played it my friends house ! now i'm clue fanatic trying collect all versions ! this game never get old because it different outcome every time ! i strongly reccomend it anyone 8 older	1
this little difficult figure out beginning - actually read instructions - but it very fun very disney . fam loves it	1
i always loved b-wings told myself one day i would get one . these new releases caught my eye so i spent my own money get one . i not disappointed . b-wing awesome !!! it copies design features fighter movie very carefully , so it good-looking model actually , b-wing movie pretty ugly , this copies ship movie , but i've played enough video games respect its firepower . i guess it doesn't look too bad . it nice lego , but nothing perfect . here pros cons . pros : good 15 inches tall , this thing monster ! it looks really neatthe service tower nice thing realistic playwith tower display stand , this thing looks cool your bedroomfor huge fighter , it actually easy play withthis thing would probably rock star wars ship battles kids like me its 7 guns . not too hard buildcons : kind expensiveit doesn't break often , but when it , it tough repairit not too hard build , but it take whileit doesn't balance too well service tower/display stand because it so heavy . don't touch it though you'll finethe ten numb minifigure doesn't look too good my opinionyou open s-foils manually . you think lego would little gear-wheel open it . missiles zip range , but lego never really came through missile department anywayengines look bit tiny compared rest modelthe mechanic minifigure(whichever one you choose use , i like use ten numb minifigure)doesn't lot room stand onthe pilot minifigure kind hard fit inoverall , most flaws tiny it really cool ship worth $35	1

my daughter loved it her birthday . it really cute	1
we bought this our son christmas present . he not quite two yet , i thought he might not totally get concept this would toy i could put up later . boy i wrong . he loves this puzzle set . i find he plays it longer gets less frustrated if i first let him pick out which picture he wants " build " then take necessary shapes out place them next him . he very proud himself once he gets pieces then he'll give himself big round applause(which mommy daddy also ) . great self-esteem builder fun way teach shapes	1
this brightly-colored , sturdy pattern block set . i would give this set child 20 months 3 years . my 22-month old just loves it . soon he saw it ( hidden away , intended christmas gift ) he kept me open it . i finally gave , i am so glad i . he perfect developmental level this toy ! he tries match up shapes colors , even starting name shapes his own . this such exciting age ! i like how solid wooden boards double-sided very sturdy . there more than enough pieces go around- even if few lost over years . few pictures arrived some scratching , but i think this more annoying me than it my child . don't forget these patterning blocks also used independantly boards . this enables your child come up more challenging creations she or he developes greater skill this area	1
my sons love rock fold chair . they use it when their friends come over they play games long time . they watch tv rock love chair . i love fact folds i just store it closet room play . thank you this product great space saver great kids	1

" game life one first games i purchased , but i could not more disappointed quality " new improved " game . game i grew up buildings , bridges , houses , etc . permanently embedded into game board . new game , these 3d decorations come off placed board each time you play . this my main complaint new game . every time you accidently knock board or brush one buildings your sleeve , they fall off . add this age-old problems people not staying cars spinner not working properly ( it worse new game , way ) game life becomes game frustration . after one game new game board , our family decided we would not play game again . i am now looking auction sites trying find one " old fashioned " game boards . they really took step backwards this one	-1

this looks like such great toy , packaging really impressive , but don't fooled like we . i assumed paying close 25 dollars it would somewhat durable-just reasonable durability-i don't expect much plastic toys ... but this really really bad . you might also think paying much would give you things like closable doors ... you know , 99 cent matchbox cars ' doors stay closed , but space shuttle doors don't-which limit it " fun " factor . " movable arm " just free floating plastic stick simply stuck into hole .. it doesn't even stay . " launch pad " fuel tank/boosters down right horrible . they don't connect shuttle , which disapointed all us , especially my son . it so cheaply made , i really can't believe it wasn't bought dollar store . my son so excited this set . but after playing it just few minutes he hasn't gotten it out again . i would definately not recommend this	-1
i've got this thing my twins ne = ew year , they've enjoying it one day so far . we two sets , it much more fun than just one - going one shooter against two robots indeed deathwish . i don't know how durable it prove - robots suffered some tumbles without ill effects , but it only one day . one drawback i found toy inability go shooter shooter - some reasons pistols , when set team team , refuse shoot one . but it fun toy nevertheless . only educational value i discern this set little bit understanding just how stupid computers , may realization light " bullet " gets reflected off white surfaces , so robot canshoot you even when its back turned toward you . otherwise , not eductaional all . thankfully :)	1

play game itself great -- similar scattergories you'll coming up words fit certain category looking them start certain letters alphabet , but several twists make it even more entertaining . one beef i really this game deck available categories too small -- just two or three games you'll begin repeat categories . so , you may wish augment deck categories your own	1

ok , so my daughter appears like toy , but it driving me crazy !! music singing voice incredibly annoying -- far most annoying all her toys ( which saying something ) . furthermore , whatever educational value there may voice saying " red pan " when red pan placed top yellow one subverted when my daughter figured out ( within 2 minutes opening box ) how press button get same result . so we just hear " red pan ! red pan ... red pan ... red ... red ... " over over . i personally am suspicious these toys so many sounds lights music voices etc etc not encourage development imagination .	-1
parents find songs really annoying !! :) my baby thinks this greatest toy ever ! he 10 months old these two months so far . he loves taking pots out putting them back getting them play music , over over over over .... we put it away every once while so it doesn't drive us crazy , but baby , it great !	1

okay , original b-wing little under-scaled wasn't very accurate movie . lego gained alot popularity over years , alot more than before . alot people asking new b-wing because : 1 . they weren't fans time get it . 2 . b-wing just so cool . here my review : b-wing , well , just looks so nice ! i don't know why it called b-wing , since it resembles more than anything else . oh well , still cool ship . you get two minifigures , b-wing pilot dressed nice looking red . you get sullustan pilot named ten numb . ( yes ten numb real star wars character , he dressed red return jedi . ) i think ten numb looks great . if you see his actual picture , i think you would agree . b-wing pilot classic smily face what looks racing helmet . shweet ! two pilots you only need one . b-wing masterpiece . not only it look more accurate than it previous self , it more accurate . b-wing itself very sturdy . two cons come b-wing though . one them missiles shown not fire properly . you must tilt b-wing so , which very annoying . those dreaded stickers . you never really get them right . oh well , i don't even put stickers anyway . b-wing comes nice yellow black service station tools so you display b-wing . i don't use it because reality , b-wing lands horizontally . but it still nice used other sets if you like . all all , this b-wing literally destroys old . you get two pilots when you only need one . price isn't bad considering pieces . i think every fan should own least one these . i'm still trying figure out shape though ..	1

[ ... ] my sister i thought we would able instant message using these across neighborhood . so we split up , loading " chips " . our displeasure , we walk all way back , switch " chips " put them . this not very good toy . first , you annoyingly scroll through each letter . example , type , you press select button 25 times enter it , so messages take least 5 minutes . then you physically hand these little chips your friends . it would 100x easier just talk them . there ton little gadgets like these , but this one worst . you better off just talking or buying toy this nature , nobody wants walk , switch " chips " walk away .	-1
my daughter loves open close microwave , refridgerator door , oven door . she also likes sounds this makes . my older daughter different model 5 years ago which she just adored . both seem really good , although prior one bit better ... door sturdier it came shapes " ice cubes " - they would put them shape sorter door , then push button they would come out . this one , you just place food shapes slots they fall out . also , there slot phone ... this model it just comes phone , no real " place " it . anyways , all all , this one good she enjoys it ( just turned 1 ) . definitely good buy 9mos+	1
my 17 month old enjoys playing this kitchen , mimicking mommy . however , past few months she really shown interest kitchen playsets 2+ child stand while using . she doesn't go this kitchen often she used . her , this toy seemed it prime 3 months ( 12-15 months age ) now she moved next level play . it cute toy introduces toddlers kitchen " ideas " , but it either needs more intrigue or younger age start . i think when she 9 months old or even just sitting up she would fun playing parts it-opening refrigerator/microwave/or oven , hitting stove make music play or turning " water " sink make music play . she may more trouble shape sorter then , but i think toys good grow into . i not recommend this 12-month toy . wait few months buy one 2+	1

this puzzle great , i'm glad i bought it my 2 year old , claire . however , like most toddlers , she prefers things her size . i find hands this puzzle slim adult sized hands , like my own . maybe makers felt " mommy " sized hands way go , or simply they wanted fill space standard sized wooden puzzle . i think it would nice make hands toddler sized , chubby palms fingers . said , it great tool . we don't use it much counting , though it intent . this more prop song fest " where thumbkin " even more exciting prop game " dr. claire " wherein she repairs " owie hand " . all all , fine addition your wooden puzzle collection	1

we bought this set over year ago my daughter still carrying it her everywhere . most marker sets you find stores only 24 or 36 colors . here you 100 colors choose . they come zippered case opens into full circle markers arrayed beautiful rainbow . each marker pops into case so they all place you instantly see if one missing . markers withstood endless pictures but now getting bit dry so we replacing them . $15 it seriously may #1 value all toys we ever purchased our children over years .	1

first all i would like point out mr. i-was-40th-in-australia kind jerk . posting up reviews bash all other reviews page rude arrogant , frankly its pretty egotistical him act like his opinion better than all others this board . although it true , itself , this deck wont winning any tournaments , you dont insult people point out . just remember this customizable card game , so dont worry switching around cards this deck enhance it bi t.t hat said , i would like say this deck some really fun cards . my opinion , not only cards some great powers ( marauding captain able special summon monster just summoned example ) . one other thing note this deck it only 1 monster you need tribute summon . which means if you get monster your hand , you play it . my opinion cards this deck also some coolest pictures structure decks too . obnoxious celtic guards mid-evil look , beautiful warrior lady waste land , each card really colorful detailed . folks who design yu-gi-oh ! cards definitely went extra package this . other thing i want mention this deck its warrior specific . yu-gi-oh ! there more warrior-type monsters than any other type game . what this means warrior-type most flexibility , most customizable all monster types due massive amount abilities warriors . so when you go customize this deck , dont worry lack monsters , spells , or traps add it . final statement : warriors like rpg characters . some may start out weak , but get far better adding equipment them . so here my suggestion , look around different equip spell cards get idea what abilities you your different warriors just adding some good weapons . combine equipment right abilities your warriors wipe out anything your enemy sends you	1
well , i these cards while i love them ! i mean i thought 5 combos won duels all them . if your fan warriors i recommend you buy it . plus all you add few elemental heroes you mini jaden deck	1
my bought this hoping my kids would able finally sing one songs . effort " jazz up " these kids songs , many them difficult sing long . seller great . i'm just not impressed this fisher price system . neither my kids .	-1

i very tall 4 year old almost 2 year old . they constantly fighting over foot room big step 2 wagon . i broke down bought this $[ ... ] radio flyer navigator wagon . after using it couple months now , it well worth money . it considerably bigger ( wider seats , slightly more room feet ) plus storage seat boot . it much nicer ride ( nicer wheels , longer handle , feels less likely tip over even sharp turns ) . i use this wagon cart my kids everywhere , fromt mall museums . since this wagon holds up 150lbs , i figure i'll get couple years out it . very much worth money .	1
i purchased this wagon yesterday my 3-1/2 year old daughter . i absolutely love it . she over 40 inches tall fits it comfortably . i love cup holders storage area under back seat . you take this wagon anywhere place put snacks or other items . it very easy pull handle longer than most . alot room 2 children sit without constantly kicking each other . my parents purchased radio flyer all terrain wood metal wagon her her first christmas . its great wagon but now she wants one sit . it also fits back my van so we taking this parades walks now	1
when we looking wagons i tried so many them out store . i finally settled this one because i wanted plastic durability little flip up seats seat belts because i not too sure my 1 year old would sit still ride wagon . i casually mentioned this wagon described it my grandparents saying i putting it my son christmas list . 2 days later my grandpa called found wagon brand new yard sale $8.00 . you imagine ! my son got it birthday gift , it remained his favorite toys ever . he immediately climbed it sat down . we wouldn't fasten straps , but we usually . i like fact he can't fall out wagon backwards when we go uphill or if i start pulling it too suddenly . fact it converts flat bottom wagon also nice hauling stuff around garden or laundry one end house other . we typically keep wagon our garage , i move it side car opposite door house because every time i would let my son out house get car he would climb wagon cry when i got him out . every chance he gets he pulls it out its parking spot wants go ride . few times i brought it inside he played hours it- which 1 year old remarkable . steering little more difficult due handle atached wagon tires rotating instead traditional design , but just means it less likely tip over . it light even fit trunk our volkswagen passat lot luggage few other birthday gifts . i surprised ! we taking it trips zoo now . definitely worth money- it investment should last years	1

i love this game would suggest it any family gathering . it possible suggest poor answer just make point ulltra-conservitive sister or free spirit brother who needs get job . great way unite two families or holiday event would otherwise drag . put kids bed invite their friends . i don't want tell you more if i reviewer something what would i review ? then every one guesses . accounting statements ? books ? pornorgraphic movies ? then i select one i like best . play continues . trust me keep kids away if you really fun	1
this game winner , especially those who shy away solo performance ( required pictionary or charades , example ) intense competitive aspects other games . imaginiff requires insight attention personalities other players invites interesting conversation how we perceive one . many questions hilarious clever . great family or party game	1

i bought this toy my 3-year-old daughter who obsessed cutting hair . i am happy purchase . inside chamber easy my daughter fill , she easily switch scalp attachments herself . she occasionally needs my help attach person base . right now she too young use press molds hairbows , mustaches , etc ., but she gets older i think she enjoy them . my only complaint pink lever/stand not click firmly into larger yellow base holds accessories . they frequently come apart . minor problem but annoying nonetheless	1
i purchased this toys us after reading reviews here amazon ( i could not purchase through amazon ) . our boys ( 21 , 16 , 11 4 ) blast . other choice golden tee which i also wanted purchase but quickly changed my mind after reading amazon reviews . this great gift price i paid , which less than $20 , graphics aren't bad either !! i'm extremely pleased .	1
we bought this item 5 years ago while my son only 1-1/2 years old , then he couldn't reach pedal but wanted ride it so bad , since i'm petite ( 102 lbs . ) i drove it around our yard together my son . it great ! now my son already 6 years old little sister ( 2 years old ) they fun driving it together . my yard not smooth , it gravel driveway but i say this gator surpassed my expectation ! i noticed plastic wheels kept spinning uphill surface but just little push it works , other than my son loves driving it our dirt round-about it runs fine	1
i bought this my 5 year old march . after reading all reviews i figured i either going get lemon or not i not . this thing run into fences , swingsets , gas meters , house , sand boxes , trees you name it my kids pretty much ran into it im not just talking head either they run into poles axle nothing gone wrong . battery lasts atleast hour half around 100 lbs . ( 3 kids ) it riding so so slope . my son weights around 40 lbs . started problems getting started hill because he doesnt enough weight back but figured if he put it fast he get going . one thing i didnt like peg perego website makes it look like seat slides but you take some bolts off move it , also instructions like everyone says took me little over hour put together i think reason mostly because they only pictures no words . fact this hold up 130 lbs . amazing my children able use this years . my daughter ( 2 years old ) starting drive this now instead her little 4 wheeler . we thinking getting something else peg perego her . cant really think anything else im sure im forgetting stuff but i hope this helps your decision . i never contact customer support but sounds it other reviewers they seem pretty good	1
my 4 1/2 year old son got this his 3rd birthday it still going strong ! even after his uncle put tow hitch it he tows any thing he , including his sister barbie jeep . he " 4x4 "' , slams into things just generally very hard it ! compared his sister jeep cousin ride toys , turning radius best i seen , two front seats quite roomy battery holds better than i expected . it rides pavement , gravel grass ease running start make it up some decent grassy hills . it well worth extra money . only con i could find it isn't big enough me drive !	1

my husband i recently purchased this item our 3-year old daughter , although toy recommended ages 4 up . advised if your little one prone sticking small objects his or her mouth or if there baby house then i would probably pass this product . pack includes small , button-size " click-in controllers " which choking hazard . my opinion , real fun this toy comes rocketpack itself so small pieces always stored away smaller children . our daughter could not get enough out her new rocketpack . she even wore it when she brushed her teeth ( well , we pretend earlier our bathroom moon) ! reason i highly recommend this toy because it helps child use their imagination fullest . pack also includes activity card space mission activities which helps aid their imaginative play . rocketpack very durable good amount storage space . it even useful outside house . instead putting her newly found " treasures " ( a.k.a rocks flowers ) into mommy pockets , my daughter now place them her backpack . it so much fun our daughter , yet still practical . your little one pretend zoom into space no matter where they turbo rocketpack	1

i bought this my boyfriend he avid fan playing golden tee countless hours bar . actual joystick game very similar bar version , although graphics somewhat reminiscent nintendo circa 1990 . regardless , fun , well priced way simulate game your own home	1
i looking forward this game quite some time . i so happy finally get game . after installing 4 batteries i hooked game up my tv disappointed before i even started playing . graphics horrible screen shaky . besides look control panel this nothing like real game you find bars . i am surprised incredible technologies willing put their name this product . trackball joke . it barely spins you can't get any power your shots . you never see golfer like you real game when you putting you can't adjust hill , terrain , or anything else . putting too easy . there no way miss . driving fairway shots unreliable because weak trackball doesn't respond what you intend . i don't money or room my place buy arcade version so i figured this would good substitute . boy i wrong . there no course selection course you play absolutely boring . i am going return this unit tomorrow . it way too frustrating there no way get any enjoyment this game . i think i am going head bar now , play real game , drink until memory this cheap imitation long gone . i side note : i wish you could give product 0 stars . it doesn't seem fair 1 star lowest you go . one star gives this product way too much credit	-1
i got this my oldest three children ages 11 , 8 , 7 gift santa opening " balance " . children loved idea write checks now when they want something they write their " bankers " (aka mom dad ) check we buy it . so they learning once it spent its gone , so trying decide should they save or spend . since they no actual money its not burning holes pockets or getting lost . they actually thinking diffrent things when we say get your check book re-think decision wheather they really want it or not . i'm hoping it not only keeps them " borrowing " one but make sure they really want what they buy , so it not stuck toy chest within week . would given more stars but it early tell how this work long run	1
i adore my railroad rush hour , but it now taken over my 7 year old who discovered he puzzles too . he up intermediate stage very proud his problem sovling ability . ( am i ) terrific game relieving boredom , don't tricked into thinking it only kids [ ... ]	1

my initial reaction , " this stuff horrible " but came after my two-year-old threw it all over family room . course , it my fault thinking i could leave him under supervision his four-year-old brother while i changed my clothes . after destructive two-year-old went bed , my four-year-old asked me play moon sand him . few minutes later , i realized stuff really wasn't bad i first thought . yes , it messy , no doubt it . but upside , it vacuums up off carpeting very , very easily . moon sand not play doh . you can't roll it out like you play doh . you can't really use cookie cutters make shapes like you play doh . i would suggest getting one moon sand play sets or making sure you molds use it . when using molds , you pack it really tight kind tap , squeeze , tap get it out . only very gentle pressure destroy item you just spent all time creating -- moon sand very crumbly . i find it almost therapeutic squeezing it into big lump then breaking it apart fluffing it back up . consistency this stuff pretty cool . so , expect mess expect it going take little practice get hang it if you -- errrrr , i mean your kids , used play doh or clay . but , if your children enjoy crafty things or creating things their hands , they'll probably enjoy moon sand	1

assembled , this toy very pretty . especially when all dolls ( sold separately ) posed it . it very cute ! however , design/quality very poor . mattel needs keep mind parents sometimes need relocate or store toy , this playset cannot moved without falling completely apart . it falls apart when it played too . also , backdrop made out cardboard . cardboard ! it doesn't attach firmly keeps falling off . i don't think mattel bothers test market their toys actual children anymore . if they , they would know this needed more work before release . i guess it cheaper rush toy market before christmas than perfect produce quality product . if i able examine one these playsets before purchasing , i wouldn't purchased it	-1
i am pleased other people found this calculator useful . however , i cannot recommend it . i see two major problems it . most obvious very poor quality screen . lines make digits math symbols too thin , too light , very hard read . i cannot understand why they would make calculator young children such truly terrible digital display . cheapest calculator rack drug store better display than this one . second problem it gives answer division problems decimals rather than remainders . there * * calculators give remainders instead decimals . such feature would suitable such calculator this one , which clearly designed early grades . concept behind this calculator great one . calculator itself , however , poorly designed	-1

when you first realize 2006 topps baseball card set 659 cards it , numbered 1-660 , you probably thinking you know which card missing card . because wake mickey mantle death several years ago topps decided honor mick retiring card #7 . today we say modern era baseball cards begins 1952 topps set , which mantle card biggie , not just because it his topps rookie card but also because it high number 1952 set , which jumps value way up well . however , there actually card #7 2006 topps set , it mickey mantle . what kind cool card it just like all other cards set there nothing distinguishes fact mick no longer active except his career stats ending 1968 ( he stole six bases his final season those ruined legs ) . card missing #297 , alex gordon , who turned out not meet new gold standard rookie card . there some cut out versions card floating around out there you want really complete series 1 collection ( opposed four incomplete collections same price ) . intact version sold $ 7,000 because clearly it rarest card around this year . topps cut outs because under major league baseball players association rules former university nebraska star , who second pick last year draft , not sign contract until september . after years baseball cards players who never spend day major leagues , mlpa changed rules so rookie cards now only put out players who make 25-man opening-day roster or played least one major league game year before . topps anticipated gordon would make royals ' 25-man roster , but third baseman assigned wichita instead . then again , when you get complete factory set you get 659 cards plus five exclusive bonus rookie cards , so now you up 664 deficit more than made up . solves mystery missing card 2006 topps set . personally , i think this rule change great , because i like see who playing each team each year . granted , difficult today because this set already johnny damon yankees ( #185 ) , but coco crisp ( #12 ) still indian not damon replacement red sox . tom gordon ( #163 ) appears phillie photo back , but his card still says yankee matt morris ( #238 ) seen cardinal front his card giants . main thing when you get rookies , cards 296-325 series 1 #616 -45 series 2 ( jason papelbon , #355 , one two exceptions ) , you actually find players who major leagues right now , including prohibitive favorite american league rookie year award , francisco liriano ( #309 ) twins . this beats going back couple years looking all rookie cards finding only handful made it show this many years down road . topps set remains set me each year because it one history behind it , so if you feel same way it must your collection . cards #243 -59 american national league gold glove award winners , set missing a.l. catcher , who not i-rod but jason veritek , who not topps card again this year . we then award winners two leagues cy young , most valuable player , rookie year awards ( #260 -65 ) , followed team cards/managers ( #266 -95 , 586-615 ) . what they doing here interesting , because they teams arranged alphabetically arizona diamondbacks washington nationals , what you hear manager card or team card each , but never both ( e.g. , you get mets manager willie randolph new york yankees team card ) . series 2 , you find appropriate counterparts . there team stars both series . it interesting me both series 1 series 2 when you look three checklist cards each cards series end front second checklist card . rest checklists devoted insert cards available . series 2 they list seven trading places autographs trading places autographed relics each , 27 trading places relics , 20 trading places cards , 40 signers constitution , 31 signers constitution cut signatures ( includes franklin , hamilton , madison washington ) , 30 hit parade cards , 15 topps stars , 100 mantle home run history cards ( " mhr2-mhr101 ) , 100 mantle home run relics , 18 walmart cards , 15 opening day relics , 15 opening day inserts . me trading places hit parade cards interest , because they sort basic reflect what actually happened 2006 season , but rest surely takes us into realm glorious excess . no wonder i am " buy complete series " rather than " tear open hundred packs " sort person , because i really not want position hoping autograph roger sherman rather than billy wagner ( or visa versa ) . topps one baseball card set i get each year because history company not because extras	1

we thought this game bit pricey , but you get much better-made game than plastic-and-cardboard ones nearly same price . glass ' jewels ' , metal dubloons , metal ships , velvet purses , cloth gameboard all stored very well-made wooden bookshelf case strong magnetic latch . game play not limited preset course or path , but up player determine direction route . treasures gathered raiding , trading , or attacking other players . extra powers received becoming " dread pirate , " but this lost combat player . rulebook includes basic rules advanced variations keep play interesting . like all games , die rolls luck sometimes play large part but always changes . i expect it eventually become monotonous , but long after most other games would become excrutiatingly boring . rules easy alter ( such more or fewer jewels gather ) experiment other variations keep it interesting . bottom line : much more - both fun ( especially ) quality - than other games same price . we no ' buyer regret ' purchasing this game all . top-notch all way ; we could ( ) gotten far less same price . highly recommended	1
i got this my grandson ( 6 ) who wanted it because commercials . stated most other reviewers , it just doesn't work . everyone who bought it should able get their money back , or mattel should send each one free car work . it piece junk . terrordactyl works very well , but you'd crazy buy crazy croc . maybe we should all send them back company out complaints .	-1
i got this my daughter she really enjoyed it . it came 5 pieces weren't hard put together , but you make sure they snapped together well . little head came off first time she played it , but i found i hadn't pushed it together hard enough . it hasn't fallen off again , yet . it made little mommy dolls , which 14 " long they work well it . it even place behind ears doll hands hold . price , i thought it good deal	1
we two boys ages 3 20 months . they throughly enjoyed this toy . it took my husband i only 1 hour assemble . my older son enjoyes higher slide while my yonger son enjoyes lower slide . they also love hiding underneath . it very durable well made . i know our boys enjoy this years come .	1
i just got webkinz my kid last week . he loves his puppy webkinz very much . however , this website keeps all kids hooked . what bothers me most some pop-up games allure him play keep coming back webkinz site daily order earn kinz kash ( virtual money this website ) . one gimmick this website entices your kid addicts them similar gambling websites , they really game no different slot machine !! this makes my jaw drop seeing what he playing !! i couldn't believe it !! beware your kid might learning how play slot machine very early age when you let them enter webkinz website unsupervised !! my wife need pull him out tell him this not good kid play something like slot machine or gambling-like games , even though it originate webkinz website . please make sure parents always supervise your kids when you let play webkinz online . this website not 100% safe kids . they seem hidden agenda alluring your kids become addicted their games their sites order make sure your kids keep their membership once their first yr member expires . some ( or most ) their games non-educating games really not much different gambling websites . this webkinz website not safe kids . beware addiction , crave earning more kinz kash which makes it indifferent gambling websites	-1
this cute little guy big hit christmas morning . he arrived early packaged well	1

only difficulty i this bath toy sometimes water doesn't drain out jet ski quickly i would like . my 2-year old son loves it , though plays it every night bath tub . he huge diego fan	1
this game really great i highly recommend it . my 3-yr old girl my 7-yr old boy both really enjoy it . even though my daughter doesn't know all characters , she search color match pictures her bingo card pictures screen . because it random anyone win which , course , kids love . this also great grandparents who know nothing nickelodeon characters want fun , low-key game play . spongebob little video tutorial beginning , so there no difficult instructions understand . also means it takes just couple minutes before you're actually playing . there little montages throughout ( like 2-min . shorts ) featuring various characters keep their attention . we play this again again . they should come up version magnetized chips so we play car	1
this toy suggested my son physical therapist help him improve his wrist strength ( writing problems ) . he lot building toys but this one works wrist more super fun . he made dozens different vehicles contraptions it really likes it . i would recommend any zoobs , but car designer set real hit	1
my " not quite four year old " received this product christmas gift . he loves building toys , loves cars , enjoys putting together toy cars . this easy four year old manipulate , but allows child create his or her own designs . it works manner similar k'nex , but pieces easier snap together , therefore less frustrating	1
i recently gave this car birthday gift four year old boy my home daycare . he loves it so much ! it very detailed yet still very rugged . he two problems it but older child would more patience . it difficult getting his batman sit all way down seat . unless he all way down , top won't close popped off ( it looks difficult pop off , but this kid it ) . it easy adult pop back . second issue getting arrows shoot out back into guns . you rotate them until they pop . these pretty minor problems if you child little patience overall quality far outweighs these issues	1
my 5 year old hooked this toy when it first came out . now movie just released dvd it contains lot batmobile footage .... he hooked all over again ! my kid really hard his toys most missing heads , arms , legs , broken or dismantled within day . this toy still working 100% still one piece ! this not junk toy well worth money spent	1
product impressive but it more delightful if miniature batman included . i thought miniature batman included this product . well anyway , product impressive	1
we recieved this part gift box my mom bought costco . i didn't think much it when i saw it but it bright colorful . also package blue hippo blocks inside it plunger push them out . frankly speaking my 6 month old ( time , now 7months ) didn't know what it , it didn't capture his attention . however wow ! this gadget triangle ! my goodness !! there so much look , he captivated it . :) he'll play one side triangle so long he forget it activities other sides . so every 10 minutes or so , i'll flip it he gurgle renewed enthusiasm start playing ' new ' side ! when my son gets sleepy lies back his nursing pillow , often i'll hold it up turn it back forth so he watch 2 gears race up down . one them moves zig zag pattern other spins , its even fun me watch . side note , its great exercise your wrist . it also makes pleasant sound , when tiny balls rattle , sounds like your shaking box salt , not too loud , perfect drowsy baby . i also like : 1 . it so many toys it but just one piece , so no lost parts or cleanup . 2 . no batteries needed . 3 . its not loud toy , just loud enough . i highly highly recommend this toy , its really bargain ! one update : 9 months , my child still crazy triangle . i believe whole infantino gift box both toys $[ ... ] . no batteries needed . :) what bargain !	1
gift my sister 6th birthday . i over-joyed because i one when i her age . i ended up decorating crown , although i'm sure she could handled it , i just think she wouldn't thought make pattern make it look nice . setting game board up little hard . you remember how colors go otherwise it won't fit just right . it like puzzle almos t.t he jewlery just like classic game , simple easy take off . yes it cheap that good thing seeing how both my sister i forgotten take off one piece well after we played game . jewlery even fit me 22 so even us big kids play ! there isn't much difference this one original except you cinderella themed board edges clock tower . if original cheaper then get one . it won't make difference girl because game still same . only downside when we played just two players it hard get rid clock tower ( which you need , win ) . we would just end up going around around board either trying get rid tower or trying get " take any piece " circle get crown . we ended up making it so if you landed clocktower after you already it you put it back game board . i think three or more players we could just keep circling but just us we use cheat . thing us when i tried open one earrings it fell apart this first time we played it . it didn't break , i just pop it back into it tiny holes but it still sucked since it new game .	1
my daughter loves this game . it not educational , but usually better than watching tv . advantages- box takes up little space . i actually like how board 4 puzzle pieces this reason , not find it flimsy . - jewelry seems durable other play jewelry me , but i not bought disney jewelry before . - spinner/ jewelry box seem very durable , such great idea . - my daughter loves just playing jewelry dressup . disadvantages- not very educational ( little strategy involved ) . - many fathers would not willing play this game . - game pieces so much fun apart game , they may become los	1
my daughter received this gift christmas play kitchen . she just loves putting her apron oven mitt baking things . she even uses towel like daddy does- like oven mitt .	1
we love this case because it fits all cars , even big ones . we actually looking buy one because so many more cars come out they don't all fit one case	1
tamagotchi connections very cool . they usually sold out lots places because right now they so popular . they're really fun play because you play games enter codes online , buy stuff , feed them like real parent would . they're not best bring school though because they distract you class . it usually best leave them home put them pause . most people think they're pretty dumb so if you like playing electronic toys , then you should maybe consider buying one these . if you decide buy one these you might want buy extra set batteries case yours runs out . they're platinum batteries tamagotchi hold two	1
my friend three tamagotchis they so fun play wit ! minis make no sense but still v3 so awesome	1
my 3 year old grandson wild cooking shows especially emeril . so his mom . he would set up large ottoman his mother pots pans . now he his own utensils loves them . his favorite his own timer which only times one minute	1
i this ant farm child loved it . it very educational entertaining . ants created their own little community , connecting " highways " ( tunnels ) , graveyard ( they carried dead ants one little area farm buried them ) , even food " cellar " ( they stored all their extra food one little area bottom farm ) . my ants lived several months only died when my mother cleaning house tried move it . tunnels all collapsed ants killed . i am currently 4th grade teacher purchasing this my classroom . i am going use it teach habitats communitites , but most importantly lifeskills . ants exemplify so many lifeskills ... patience , cooperation , perseverance , endurance , caring , effort , problem solving , etc . wow !! so much we learn one tiny creature .	1
ant farm wonderful educational toy , but quality disappointing other reviewers said . plastic rough , unattractive edges manufacture , bottom not perfectly flat , so it wobble little bit . none this matter my nephews , but certainly manufacturer should better job	-1

my son received this gift his 2nd birthday fell love first sight . he only eyes this fire truck rest his party . two days later , it still his favorite toy . i like it not require batteries , but still makes some noises . i really think this toy staying power because there some features toy my son not figured out yet . i think he'll fun it long time	1
our 5 year old daughter got this holiday gift . it turned out favorite game entire family friends . it clever , fun , fast creative game whole family . even our 2 year old son loves it - however it changes whole out come game . he stands back just throws toppings wobbling pie but he entertained 15 or 20 minutes so that worth lot ! we'd recommend this birthday gift kids because it unique fun	1

i used love playing 3x3 rubik cube kid decided get it my son christmas . i mistakenly ordered 4x4 , but decided it didn't matter - still same kind fun challenge . day it opened , stickers started come off when i tried use it , within first 30 seconds , four pieces came off , one which broke can't fixed ! i just went online order 3x3 , but finding similar reviews stickers , etc . what disappointment !	-1
i bought cube , it ruins week later . one center pieces broke off , it irreparable . i saw it coming , though , because cube started showing signs flakiness second day : some stickers ( mostly orange ones ) begun peeling off , pieces getting very loose , very fast . cube burst side pieces out two occasions before its final destruction . i gentle possible , but if you learn how solve cube , then you'll performing thousands turns it . both 3x3 5x5 cubes seem hold up lot better than 4x4 . i'm hoping i find manufacturer . i've played 3x3 cubes many manufacturers over years , some obviously better-made more durable than others . this isn't one good ones . if you're going make serious attempts solving your 4x4 , i recommend lubricating it something . cube-solving sites seem recommend silicone spray ( whatever ) . when i high school i'd take them apart put vaseline them , which smooths over " catches " happen you turn rows slightly misaligned , also slightly glue-y effect holds it together better	-1
i bought this dissapointed . it not good turning all eventually i got angry threw it straight up watched it fall crash into nothing . most fun i've plane . if you're looking easy plane fly buy tyco rc sky scorcher it way better	-1

my daughter absolutely loves this playset . it fairly small compared ' normal ' sized playset comes different mini-ponies ( depending where you buy it ) . mini-ponies size littlest pet shop figures , without bobbling heads . accessories however tiny , i wouldn't recommend this set around any child younger than 4 . mini-ponies themselves fairly sturdy solid . there lot attention detail playset . also lots cute accessory sets purchased under $10 . i like fact you buy packs mini-ponies around same price regular sized pony . this great way good sized pony collection your child , without give up lots room . all all , i think this ponyville theme line mini-ponies hasbro keeper nice addition my little pony world	1
we given this gift when our son 5 months old . he loved it ever since . first he would lay under it kick toys , then we changed it so he could sit bumbo seat hit toys , then we changed it so he could stand it , now he walking 10 months loves walk over it his own . i think our son active guy probably destined early walker , but i credit this toy keeping him interested many stages his development helping us encourage his interest standing . it always easy change set-up this toy so he not bored it . whenever we play dates other babies , they love it too ! after it his life 5 months , he still loves play buttons rattles . i'm sure he'll continue use it he gets older art table or something . highly recommended	1
this monopoly game exactly what i looking . i impressed durable wooden property houses metal player pieces . " chance " " community chest " cards neat too because they relevant 1930 history . there only two things i think they could better job . first all , there aren't enough houses hotels . i played full-length game several others , end game we using household jiblets signify houses hotels . secondly , property prices not printed board . game comes paper sheet lists property values . it cumbersome keep referring easy lose track .	1

i'm not sure what people talking three foot radius . that how mine first , but i finally figured out how make them work . they more or less average 2 mile radius . i wouldn't expect too much , come people ! these kid toys ! they aren't going give 7 yr . old pair hundred dollar talkies , now would they ? main trouble getting battery . after we batteries , it came testing time . they work pretty well , except if it below 60 or 50 degrees . then , only one work , not even well . but , i figured out how make them quiter without turning them off ! hold you're hand over mouth piece really tightly ... it should elimanate most static . but , ten dollars , these very good pair . i am however saving up uniden ten mile radius 20 dollar adult walkie talkies	1
my son received this his 4th birthday . he his older brother , age 8 , spent lots afternoons playing this toy trying out all our cars . they great time i think this great product , much better than some other hot wheels tracks we gotten past . this would make great gift	1

i like handle carry this keyboard around , but it kind awkward little ones use unless it sitting table or other flat object . characters set off when they moved you get jumbled mass sound coming out it if it resting against something causes characters pushed all once . i know my 2 year old not like sitting still , so using this table not really option her . because height characters , it not good " bring " toy since it doesn't fit bag well . same price , go wiggles guitar . it many more buttons songs they carry it around play it same time	1
my 3-year-old grandson loved this ; only problem it it breaks apart little easily when he plays little hard it . it beautifully designed few months he should able handle it little more carefully . playmobil makes great toys	1

this toy purchased birthday gift our 5-yr old son . great toy . instructions story . we bought pedal type exercise value item . it scoop/lift front trailer back lots yard fun/work . i'm rn put multitude toys together over years . my husband engineer built our home , our son " treehouse " bed multitude safety features , fixes people air conditioners computers after experts fixed them they still don't work , etc ... we both use reading following assembly instructions . ( three children grown married . ) basically saying , we're not rocket scientists but we reasonably intelligent people . instructions come written words drawings show assembly . no where parts identified what they or how many included . there parts list if you need reorder something . part 4 ( shown drawing ) spst3215n . instructions don't assemble it numbers , just name . ( " insert screw , attach retainer " . ) there assorted screws different lengths . instruction simply read " insert screw ... " you wing it this one hope select right screw . instuction number nine reads " insert retainer special device . " seriously , " special device " . no where it identified what special device . i started it , my husband finished it it together working only one mystery part left . our son enjoying it loves helping yard even more now . great toy ! poorly written instructions . people who wrote instructions should return their salary hours , days or weeks they they employed write these instructions . very poor job	1
my 3 year old got this christmas . seemed like neat idea until he figured out if he picked it up it just really great , big tamborine . it also just encourages my kids get wound up . faster they move , more wild music . we never use it , i'm just waiting appopriate amount time pass before i sell it e-bay	-1
i trouble getting this product work , but only because i too eager play hadn't read enclosed instructions . initially , i set sensitivity all way 10 frustrated when it didn't work all . instructions say turn down sensitivity until lights turn off . once i , it worked great . sensitivity too high , it interpreting everything one constant movement not picking up changes , so it wasn't identifying my movements . now i understand instructions , i get it work anywhere . it such great toy , you can't not buy this one	1
we got this game something new family after thanksgiving dinner . this great game if you looking something just any age play . only limitation only 4 play time . we overcame this playing teams .	1
i so looking forward playing this my kids . i 9 3yr . old , big age difference hard find games we all play , so i thought kerplunk would perfect . older one would fun it something little one could play without stop mommy read card tell her what next . boy i wrong . first all while trying put thing together , where top bottom suppose fit perfectly together , they didn't , sticks suppose go through tiny holes couldn't because top bottom would not stay right some holes closed up . sticks also really flimsy two big top bottom pieces . i remember when i younger played it wasn't this soft plastic , it hard durable . end we tried play , first time after second stick pulled all marbles fell out so i never even got chance play . second last time we tried top fell completely off ! maybe , i just picked wrong box but i won't try convince myself it buying one	-1

i bought this my girls 64% off price , pleased purchase . she takes 2 aaa batteries , which not included . batteries go into each her thighs . we've her 2 weeks , she still spinning lighting up , gets played regularly . one thing note if her arms down , touching dress all , dress not spin . her shoes come off , but my daughters havn't figured out yet , since they fit so well . she cannot undressed like other barbies , but she gorgeous princess dress , so my girls don't care slightest . when my daughter saw her , she so very excited genevieve ... until she watched movie barbie . it point she realised movie genevieve blonde . doll still cool ( she medium brown color hair like my girls ) , lot fun , but just not quite like movie . i wish movies would more diversity . all all , sale price , i'd highly reccomend it any 12 dancing princesses fans , but i wouldn't paid full price any 12 dancing princesses dolls . they fun price , but i don't expect quality last very long .	1

based previous reviews written other people , screenshot this product ( also rediculous price ) , i bought this thinking i going get something replica . i wrong . this product biggest waste my money i long time . first all , one i recieved very rough texture card table part it , not smoothe like i expecting . second , spelltrap card zones rediculous , cards fly out back it simple flick your wrist . thirdly , place it takes your arm horrible . show , disks clearly attached duelist forearm close elbow , leaving plenty room hand movement . these attach literally your wrist actually require you hold disk one hand , making it very annoying hold , let alone look your hand . best feature it life point counter , even isn't great . it easier me callate math my head than it change numbers mark life point damage , couple calculators work much better than this pathetic system . all all , this definately not worth money . buy something else	-1

my 6 year old son got this gift christmas immediately wanted make " food " . all recipes gummies basically same , you just change flavor suit your taste . we never find flavor or combination flavor he liked , ended up throwing out all treats he made . drinks equally bad tasting . there no directions how set up your " lab " , just lot connector pieces didn't seem fit everywhere you wanted them . other reviewers stated , you need adult there help mixing . he grew bored kit , put it away , not asked play it again .	-1
we thought it lot set up . lab not seem stable . my 9 year old could not snap mold covers molds not fill up all way mix , which left him 1/2 gummy worm . it messy , awkward not worth money we paid it . it trash . we wouldn't buy one . also piece used mixing - what odd design . i could barely pull it apart clean it make batch . save your money buy supplies make goodies bowl home	1
i got this toy my cousin who 6 . he loves it . course i help him it , reading experiments all but ok . it pretty messy sticky so adult around helps . he didnt like taste some experiments so we ended up just throwing them away . i also didnt really understand whole thing connecting lab together stuff . luckily he didnt care setting it up he just making food . overall it not bad toy . just few hitches	1

we needed storage system our 2 year old . this perfect it just his height , it great storage both toys books . i'm glad i read reviews first thought . i knew right away look hardware one bins ( although i can't imagine why customer service doesn't know tell you look there instead sends more)also , first time we tried putting it together , i couldn't get sides fit . we would get one screwed , but other side would then other side would off . we really trying force it , finally gave up after 30 min . i then read review one sides ( ) always faces you since other people put it together so easily , i thought i something wrong . we took then whole thing apart carefully followed directions , making sure we matched peices according picture given . this time everything came together nicely we 15 min . so other than installation ( which easy if you really follow directions carefully ) this great product	1
before you call little tikes order your missing hardware ( it arrives 1 week ) , pull apart trays make sure its not hidden there . since installing trays last assembly step , we just set stack aside never thought it again . otherwise , assembly took 1 hour not difficult	1

it took several tries before i realized " trick " setting this game up more quickly . branches enter one side hive exit through hole other side . first , i found it frustrating get all leaves through exit holes . then i realized once you've inserted dozen leaves or so , rest don't exit . then just popped quickly find support properly inserted brances . i didn't think directions clear they should . i definitley fell prey " award winning " sticker box when i bought this game . however , more we play it , more i see educational value it . my 3 year old simply thrilled learn turn-taking we try make bees fall out . my 7 9 year olds definitely more into logic competition game . all told , once you've mastered branch issue , it really fun game worth space your family game shelves	1

we love this game . my girls ages 8 6 i play this game evening . they both struggling math , which not uncommon girls their ages . we tried reduce gender bias math skills providing materials enhance math understanding young children , unit blocks , sand water play cooking activities . we just couldn't break through wall . last christmas i bought dino math tracks other math related games . this breakthrough we needed . both girls math skills understanding math concepts improved leaps bounds	1
this game great ! tiny dinos spark my 5 year-old son imagination enable him so much fun he not realize he learning . furthermore , he not want stop !!! he learned place value up thousands during our first game . after each roll dice player uses all four dice make number then s/he reads number aloud ( i.e. if you roll 6666 you say six thousand six hundred sixty six ) . we move our dinos around board t.r. looks forward our pieces landing same track so we " showdown " . " showdown " you simply roll dice person who gets larger number wins . however , we move our dinos middle board miniature battle . player who rolled larger number wins battle . loser sent back home winner gets move ahead . after playing game couple times without using cards - which simplest level play this game - my son asked use cards . so day 2 we began using cards . again he uses his imagination great deal role play he carries out instructions . it fills my heart delight see his excitement see he truly learned how read numbers up thousands . ( t.r. learned read when he 4 so he independently reads dice reads cards . ) parent i highly recommend dino math tracks because kids quickly learn lot while loads fun . this game played three levels , so it grows your child	1
it amazing how something so simple spark excitement enthusiasm babies toddlers . friend this out her 1-year-old party all kids loved playing it carrying it around if it long train . my 8.5 month old watched all other kids crawling through so much fun he crawled over peered down tunnel . i thought he'd too scared go through , but since he seemed curious i decided sit him up one side while i ran other spoke him . instantly , he smiled me started crawling toward me through tunnel . he laughing seemed enjoy interesting view sensation going through tunnel . since he still working his crawling seemed love tunnel so much , i bought one our local toys us store he loves playing it!what great : - folds up compact ring storage/travel - approximately 19 " diameter ( size tunnel ) 2-3 inches thick . - see through windows allow added fun/peek-a-boo- velcro tabs connect tents other tunnels gives added flexibility how it used- encourages crawling/floor time babies - my little guy also likes sit up look around it , or just lie around rock it ( since it free-standing ) . considering he just discovered standing can't seem get enough pulling himself up everything , it good way keep encouraging him strengthen his crawling/sitting skills . durability : - it seems relatively sturdy , really " pops " open nicely . don't know how it stand up long-term . - careful velcro mesh windows - it stick windows snag it bit . - my friend party , i notice older kids ( 3-4 years old ) really wanted jump it smush walls - not good idea case there kids still crawling through tunnel and/or because tunnel walls not meant withstand kind play , but their point view , i see how tempting it may jump it see tunnel pop back up .	1
my 15 month twins love this tunnel . they giggle chase each other it every day . definately would recommend this toy	1

my daughter ( 4 ) absolutely loves this train . we've it year , i found her sleeping it other night . sounds great , she likes it moves bacwards forwards ( although it needs help mastering steep hills ) . my complaint ours sucks life out batteries extremely quickly ... it doesn't seem normal . i don't know if its just ours or if all them work same way , but most time batteries dead she just plays happily it making her own noise . if i it over i would consider one without batteries -- i really think she would loved it just much . however , she overjoyed when i put fresh batteries quickly wears them out again	1

my 9 month old granddaughter loves this pool . it perfect size great way her cool off summer heat . i can't believe i found perfect pool such low price . it worth every penny more	1
my son great time playing this pool . i bought this item when he 7 months old , now he almost 11 months old still enjoys playing all inflatable extras pool comes . every time he pelts one stars rainbow bar , bells inside jingle -- which he thinks fabulous ! side poles hold colorful rings squeak when you squeeze them , so he good time gripping them just hear them deflate . it overall safe toy your child enjoy long they supervised , course . only difficulty i inflating pool itself . blowing it up would taken forever , using bike pump would workout . just find one your buddies industrial pump their garage or take it local gas station it take less than minute--it way easier	1
when we aren't using this ' officially ' pool outside , we keep it blown up use it inside -- makes great area play keep toys . our son loves it	1
my 6 year old daughter absolutely loved this item ! she left all her other toys played this 4 days straight ! she used it so much , i go back store stock up extra supplies . i found she more creative used her imagination lot more than any other toy she . i'm little leery using word " toy " relation pottery wheel because it more than . thank you making such great gift kids .	1
i bought this last year my son christmas . i didn't buy pvd until some time later , because all age appropriate titles or ones he would like sold out everywhere . ( he now 7)anyway , time i finally got him some pvd , system , although it unopened until time , not work . occasionally i would hear sound , but i never saw picture . i very disappointed since i purchased it quite while before we used it , i didn't bother trying return it . i gave bought video now fx player today , so i am hoping we better results this one	-1
my kids really enjoy vidoes but they tire short episodes quickly . it costs lot additional money keep up w/ videos interest them . we 12 pvds only " interactive " feature trivia quizes show . i thought there games or something more interactive . overall , i wish i bought portable dvd player . it would cheaper more interesting them	-1
purchased this train set , not knowing what it ( christmas gift request ) . turns out my 3 year old grand son loves it ! he move train track it so easy remove or add cars train . we even purchased some other train cars since purchasing this . thomas friends provide him lots chugga chugga choo choo play time	1
my son got this set his third birthday he loves it . it our first " real " thomas train set ( we track ikea bj ) it * * lot nicer than other brands . wood track railroad ties etched it straight track flips over reveal roadway . my son loves thomas this set keeps him busy hours . my son favorite part thomas go under bridge ( our cheaper tracks bridges much lower ) . he also loves move conductor gate up down keep thomas passing . trains track thomas wooden railway collection durable beautiful . my son also got " water tower steam set " ( electric thomas set ) his birthday but he chooses this one over every time . it uses his imagination keeps him involved absorbed way no other toy	1
this great game , my whole family , ages 6 65 , enjoyed thanksgiving	1
after months my friends son saying all he wanted x-mas huge elmo doll . i seen this item claiming " large " 25 " doll i agreed spending 60 something dollars get it . when he opened it my friend said it small looked sick . all they extend his legs few inches his belly strunk . needless say i highly disappointed dish out 30 something more dollars one alot bigger cheaper . so if you think your getting your moneys worth this doll forget it . i suggest " large elmo soft plush doll " fisher price .	-1
my 6 year old informed me shortly after opening this gift christmas morning it exactly what he asked santa ( thank goodness since he insisted keeping his list secret) ! we got his 3 year old brother remote control mator boys thoroughly enjoyed both toys ! i thought this especially interesting since they other remote control trucks , but there something characters cars movie really seems capture their imagination	1
i got this spare money me my brother my older parents . i only played it few times , but it worth money . some rounds fun challenging while others fun easy . usually last round , bonus round , easiest . it doesn't 10+ . my brother 8 he no problem playing it . it lots fun whole family , ages young old . my aunt it too , because she so obsessed wheel fortune , she wouldn't share it us ! so we took advantage bought it . boy , tv plug video game people made great hit this ! it truly one kind ! i also like childish constantly spin wheel controller even when game hasn't turned :) but now , this second , i am trying get it . it not turning ... could this end my game ? maybe ... i might check batteries . ok ? now , i must my way ..	1
i wrote this review because i not think this game should rated so low . my son picks cars play everytime we get vsmile out . i like it because he able drive car road out difficulty bigger systems or arcade games . he learning while he playing , too	1

i love this desk only $[ ... ] ! my son 1.5 yrs old loves read color we didn't small childrens table him sit down these kinds activities ( we live very small 2 bedroom apt manhattan ) i took my chances ordering this desk him , hoping it would comfortable ( right size/length his body legs ) we this desk now 2 months i receive so many compliments it . my son loves sit it all activites/reading even eating his snacks it ( crayon marks come right off simple wipe ) .!! his little legs don't yet reach ground , but little blue cubby below little lip allows his feet rest just perfectly ! ( this also how he gets up sit seat all himself ~ stepping blue cubby lip ) . it very easy put together well . box came without nuts bolts accident , but i called company directly they fed-ex'd n/b very next day ! great company great product ! i definitely give it thumbs up	1

we bought this tunnel over year ago our then-crawling almost-one-year-old . i figured it would encourage her crawl more , which it -- she loved it ! now she running , screaming , jumping , independent 2 yo who still drags this tunnel out back corner play area ( where i've tried hide it ) squeals excitedly when we pop it out her play . her older sister , who now 3 1/2 , also loves tunnel . she copies her aunt ideas stands upright tunnel pretend she monster , or hops it around her pretends caterpillar or frog . we don't yet any tent accessories , but we build our own tents sofa cushions sheets , then stick one end tunnel gap , you secret entrance special hideaway . this one those classic toys children all ages find lots uses -- it sparks creativity imagination , gives mom few minutes ' break go clean kitchen . ;-)	1
i ordered this tunnel my three year old she very excited it . she loves playing it . however , main picture product shows two tunnels joined together , so i expecting longer tunnel than we got . it still provides lots fun , just wish it long it looks picture	1
i really wanted baby doll my daughter ( 14 months)could take tub her brush/wash her hair , etc . this ok . it serves it purpose ... somewhat . dolls hair up band which i thought could just taken out but it actually " sewn " into her hair/head . so she can't really wash or brush dolls hair . water seat it comes also too difficult child put doll into . not worth money my opinion , i wish i would spent extra money gotten her gotz baby bath doll	-1

terrence probably not made track - since he tractor meant used fields , or plowing snow . said , this little guy goes everywhere our house we haven't any trouble tire treads . if your child prone pick such things like mine , just see if he get them off , then i suggest maybe advising otherwise . my little one figured out how get them off very quickly , but became aggravated they not when he " plowing field . " so , i put them back well , they haven't come off since . some neat role playing occurs terrence . he just opens new doors working outside track especially all new construction guys introduced lately like alfie jack . terrence lot fun our house he comes highly recommended	1

this dora lego set generally high quality . my two year old likes play it -- especially dora boots figures . he little young put all it together himself , but he gets it out lot . my only negative would mat legos placed only made flimsy cardboard , but it not really essential set .	1
i not following technic series quite while but when i saw this i knew i get it . get it i . it might bit pricey , personally i don't like motorized pieces because uncertainty ( might go kaputt anytime ) , but this sure looker ! however it not all perfect , imho ; outriggers could made more powerful ( how so matter ) . turntable could geared . there could pair wheels ( imagine ) . there could suspension wheels . dummy steering wheel front looks rather ridiculous . but nonetheless this still master piece . what next , giant fire engine ? count me	1
4 kids , ages 2-8 , we least 3 or 4 bins these blocks . this size really nice because they easy handle build . finished product not come out tiny . this size nice also because it not small enough really choke hazard my 2 year old not so large my 8 year old feels like she playing baby toy . i said previous review , duplos absolutely most played-with toy this house . everyone enjoys them . possibilities endless when you million blocks ! when doubt , buy duplos ! no kid doesn't like them there no such thing too many . . . ** description says something gold blocks this set . i no idea what they're talking . we bought 2 our sets this listing here amazon i assure you we absolutely no gold blocks .	1

this cute idea , but materials used make this cheap . if it weren't my daughter getting this her birthday friend , i wouldn't spent money it myself . it cheaply made falls apart easily . ropes hold swings , broke off within one day . my daughter loves this toy , gotten other sets go it . she plays it often , but isn't made well . babies homely , so tiny they hard dress . she loves it all same . she six her sister ten , they play it all time . i am hoping this toy continues grow new sets coming out , but i also hope assessories made better than this item	1
my husband i purchased this toy our 5 year christmas . we unfinished basement so we let him play this downstairs . ( it too cold play outside now . ) toy fun when it actually works . many times balls get stuck . it very frustrating constantly trying get them actually pop out . when they sometimes they too low hit . we haven't yet tried play t-ball it . it fairly light so it possible it may tip over many times . i find pieces pretty durable . my son continue play it but he often stops cause it gets frustrating . he sometimes just plays balls bat so it wasn't total loss	1

my son received read me dvd system all dvds early christmas present his uncle . after week this dvd dr. seuess one his two favorites . this dvd charming story curious george visiting chocolate factory . it fun game where kids make their own chocolate candy design machine . it also teaches new vocabulary . one part story teaches children what " curious " means so they understand why george his name . i like my son learning new words , listening entertaining story , enjoying himself same time . i would recommend this dvd purchased if someone wondering which ones series buy . it much better than some others .	1
i owned this doll over six months now . she wonderful condition . i'm not sure where start , because everything this doll takes my breath away ! i describe my doll you . lindsay lohan , popular actress singer , now beloved collector doll millions homes . i'd like start saying this doll not onlt resembles , but looks exactly like real lindsay lohan(before she died her hair blonde then brown ) . everything her looks like real lindsay lohan-from her long red hair , her freckles , her eyes , even her smile ! $30 wonderful bargain collectors doll so beautiful so much durability . her coat super soft , easy get . her dress beautiful . it flower pin . her extra outfit many possibilities . extra skirt may used dress , or it matched blouse , or it paired white shirt . all these options may used coat or wrap . top , there two pairs shoes choose . all clothes match , so you don't worry combination outfits looking weird . both shoes easy slide , but personally , i don't care pink shoes . they make lindsay feet look large pointed . but that only my opinion . lindsay amazing accessories . her director char red-carpet ropes look fabulous when display . all little accessories , i won't get into . they somewhat useful , but not so important . i would like describe one them . laptop cd drive opened . dvd cases then opened , dvd inside them may places into cd drive . nothing happen , course , but it great pretend . so , i recommend this doll ? most definately ! what not love ? ( ...	1
my 7-year old loves this . it tons extras very unique	1
i quite disappointed phone aspect this toy ( hippo game fine 3-year-old ) . entire number pad presses single unit makes random tone each press ( you cannot press different numbers individually ) . also , when you close flip phone , it doesn't hang up like real phone would , rather it keeps dialing/talking until it finishes its conversation . buttons outside phone merely decorative ( other than phone game switch ) . also it bit large child hand . positive : voices fairly realistic , not too annoying . hinge seems pretty sturdy , i expect it withstand quite bit abuse child	-1
if you put tracks carpet or even area rug i'd definitely get " sure tracks " hill , we problems trains getting stuck either before or after . however , if you train table , or any hard surface it not neccessity . battery-powered train nice though not super fast any means . also , switch top hard my son 2 1/2 turn off , front forward , middle off back backwards , kind tough get it middle off so when i tell him go turn his engine off if he going leave room , i help him or it myself . also invest some rechargable aaa batteries they only last day or two if they run lot . this mountain adventure set definitely " cute " factor going . love mountain/tunnel bears cave . all pieces seem high quality , even plastic mountain bridge .	1
all stories offered read me player all great classics . this one new one us , cameron enjoyed it . i think my son really enjoyed this story . someone also gave him hard back book his birthday , he loves this one . i think any read me dvd offered it great one . they either new or timeless classics they learn read , follow while they listen or play games relating story after . it makes learning fun . buy all them , we own them all . great concept i hope they offer more future . i think they just needed market it better during year before holidays .... awesome learning toy	1
our son ( 2-3/4 ) plays this over over . , putting pieces back into box much part game putting pieces together , so clean up not issue . who would thought 6 months playing 4 puzzles almost daily basis you would no missing pieces ! sturdy colorful well built ( other " melissa doug " products we've found ...	1
tonnes fun . comes booklet step step instructions solve puzzle , although it seems instructions might missing couple moves which makes it frustrating . i've playing it non-stop since i got it . it fun even after you solve it because it fun try improve your time i think it quite relaxing . it durable but edges stickers beginning peel . overall it great product i recommend it all ages	1
i bought this toy my son i figured if it turns out too ' girly ' i would give it my niece . it turned out , it definitely not adequae my son but it definitely more adequate my son than my niece ! it also gender neutral issues . let me give couple examples if i time one day i give more specifics : this toy sophisticated electronics but design behind it seems lacking . example , it give negative feedback choosing wrong answer but i not give any feedback if you chose right answer :-) toy designed encourage vanity other undesirable traits feels like it designed someone who sterotypical negative view what american girls like . more later got go .. probably designed some insensitive backward male out there .. my apologies all good guys out there . i know there lot you out there i am married one them :-)	-1
my son ( who just turned 2 ) received this christmas . he also received lot other thomas things . he enjoys playing it very much - we obviously teach him how connect traks build knapford station , thomas , etc ... it goes his other duplo blocks bonus his 5 year old sister also enjoys this toy . it doesn't very many " bells whistles " which why i didn't give it 5 stars , but he still enjoys it very much	1
i got this toy my 18 month old , who loves trains blocks . however , i found , much my chagrin , she insisted disassembling various lego items ( light , tunnel , station , trains .... ) . so , we could never really put set together more than 5 minutes . assembling elements also required following directions , so it wasn't really fun her play . i think this would great toy slightly older child , fact we gave ours friend who just over 2	1
this toy bit silly . my daughter likes roll balls floor , but it isn't nearly much fun some other pull-toys she . balls immediately fall off caterpillar when child pulls it , it isn't heavy enough even stay upright . it just sits toyshelf , looking cheesy . i'd recommend investing quality wooden pull-toy , instead . only great things it they didn't try jazz it up annoying flashing lights or terrible music ! reason alone , we didn't return it	-1
this toy wonderful addition roll round line , which up until this point consisted solely dinosaur , gumball machine turtle , so it certainly welcome addition . rounds come toy very cute , but not related toy they normally . instance , gumball machibe comes candy themed balls . still , rounds alwasy cute . toy itself , it very very cute . it easy pull or push or drag , moves around quite easily . only issue i it how easily balls fall out , whcih frustrates my child , i also believe pull string should bit easier hold . all all , great	1

ok , i read all reviews decided get it my 4 year old her birthday ... it hit party . she loved it !!! headset , all reviews said it really small but , my husband figured out it actually goes around back your head microphone front not worn like headband- if you put it like it fits great ... my daughter says comfotrtable too !!! love it ! i think other reviews simply wearing it incorrectly :	1
i bought this my daughter fifth birthday . she absolutely loves it . i highly recommend it but heed warnings other reviews . headset doesn't fit real well if you don't want your children listening britney spears or christina aguilera , you might want reconsider . which brings up question : where i buy additional cartridges different songs ? if you know , e-mail me [ ... ]	1
my 5 year old daughter got this guitar christmas . she couldn't wait get guitar out box start playing it like her daddy . she just rocks out it . she constantly asking her daddy play guitar her . they go into music room rock out together . guitar just toy , but 5 year old whose daddy plays guitar she just loves it anyway . my 3 year old wants one now so guess i go out get her one her birthday now . i agree mircophone poor quality . it not stay my daughter head anything . she actually gets it stay but not correct way . she tells me wiggles one these sing into it .	1
my granddaughter loves this game . she 3 1/2 yrs . old . it perfect her . i am very pleased	1
these cases perfect protectors hot wheels car . i recently went through 10 year old collection found quite few treasures there , so i ordered these give them some protection . all cars i fit cases they very sturdy . my only complaint they don't seem close completely bottom where it hinges , but i don't think affect protection much	1
this great pirate ship young kids . we bought it my 5-year-old , who loves it , his 3-year old brother . lots details pirates . i looking this ship , more expensive playmobil pirate ship . i'm definitely glad i bought this one -- all details my boys adore , but better price tag . i definitely recommend this great toy . my boys playing their playmobil toys few years -- they still toys they play most . , they so great their imagination	1

i wrote this review product same company same applies this : we purchased item hoping it would reasonable size , meaning food would closer " real " size rather than miniature . it . we also hoped it would made well stand up hopefully more than one generation use . remains seen , but stuff made well i cannot see it breaking unless you deep-freeze plastic pieces hit them hammer . nice texture , nice flexibility , pretty realistic looks . child it intended ( age 4 bit ) plays happily it , even older boys ( 10 13 ) few moments goofy fun it	1
we got this swing replace my daughter baby swing her 3rd birthday . it perfect her . she difficult time getting herself but time she grow . she feels like big kid now . swing very durable reasonably priced	1

my 15 year old daughter her friends fun making selling these bracelets . we even made up pattern our own . it fun working all different color combintions	1
main reason why i purchased this set because red dragon . there very few red dragons released dragons building toy lines it bright color drew me . i no idea toy encased metal tin , which terrific convenience storage . many other pieces repaints previous dragons collections , but i never able purchase them time because mega bloks only one production run any set . arches staircase really make this piece stand out viewing front , but back really forgetable . catapult siege weapon bonus winged beast ( moment i cannot remember what they called ) nice touches . over all i would say it would fabulous starter set anyone getting into dragons	1
it even works wiffle balls ! i bought 4 pack dollar store . their weight much lighter than foam balls it comes so you'll adjust angle test distance base/hitter first . only problem using wiffle when it windy , wind picks it up quickly so we use original balls windy days	1
i guess my husband like toy much my 3y son . they play together all time . highly recommended father-son bonding .	1
my son received this when he 12 months old played it right away . i agree figures fall over lot , but they perfect size small hands play . instead using them fire truck , my son plays elmo , big bird , dog themselves . sound voices volume buttons fire truck really draw my now 20 month old son this toy . this toy hit our house	1
great sticking high chair try entertain your child while you make her dinner !	1
i bought this particular version pictionary because we playing same version many years , so i felt it time upgrade new materials , new items draw , ect . first thing i liked this version more portable box , which no more than 9 inches long . previous version i 24 inches long major eye soar . course , presentation isn't everything . i got it home , opened box , so pleased find more than adequate supply paper tablets write pencils . also , board shrunk just slightly portability . cards now include 20 phrase cards , which state phrases instead objects . also , there now option there more than 2 teams ( 5 if i am remembering correctly ) . quality game seems increased remarkably . said all , only major thing i dislike game , while it says it 3 or more players , extremely unenjoyable without 4 players . sometimes , one wants play pictionary because it very addicting game kids , teens , adults , but 3-person-pictionary lame use such well-thought game . i highly suggest buying this game . if you don't use it daily basis , it terrific addition parties family ge t-t ogethers -- almost necessity . kids love it because it allows you draw what you get your card , but since they children , sometimes they don't know what object card ; however , pictionary necessary addition any household	1
my 5yo daughter received polly pocket sticker maker hanukkah gift beloved friend family , thus i feel terrible writing such bad review this product because gesture so kind . generous gift aside though , product sucks !!! seriously , no matter what anyone might tell you otherwise , not buy this product . first , it nearly impossible put together directions not comprehensible . i shocked i actually got it together ( it took me 30 minutes although there very few parts ) , but sure enough , soon i , my daughter made one or two stickers whole thing just jammed up broke completely . believe me - there no way fix it . i threw whole thing garbage . she really sad it , but believe me , i no other choice . it not gift ( i no gift receipt ) i would returned it full refund . please not make same mistake my very well-intentioned friend who bought this product my child . avoid it . it not worth your money	-1
this xylophone kept my then just 8 month old entertained over 4 hours straight , only one break nurse . month later it still her favorite toy .	1
me this means my son loves play this puzzle . he likes all his melissa doug chunky puzzles . this one isn't his favorite but he becomes older ( 16 months now ) more interested vehicles , this one capture his attention more . his all time favorite still pets one i never find black white cat because he carries it around everywhere	1
we purchased this puzzle our son when he 1 year old . now , one year later , he still enjoys playing it . this such wonderful starter puzzle because it teaches little ones pieces only fit one way . this seems so basic , but it lets them early success , which builds confidence doing more advanced puzzles later . also , chunky wood pieces easy small hands recognize , remove , grasp , manipulate . this puzzle not challenging our son anymore , but he really likes talking all vehicles , sounds they make , etc . like all melissa doug toys , this puzzle very well-made . one bonus this company if you lose or break piece , they'll replace it , usually no additional charge . that quality service !	1

my 3 year-old loves it ! it most realistic toy trumpet i've come across , but it still toy . we it month one keys no longer plays . it still good buy , though , it great alternative other toy trumpets don't play like real musical instruments . overall , i am very happy this purchase !	1
i'll admit i bought this my 4 year old who not only blows into it but throws it bangs it agaisnt tv . so although he wanted it i probably should've waited few years show him just how cool trumpet . i think kids who show signs interest music enjoy it . it actually sounds like harmonica but what you expect $14 . still , valves work produce different notes so that really point it . getting them familiar how instrument works . they even musical pieces back box color coded notes so your young dizzy gilepsie follow . aw go ahead grab it , why not ? my son miles approves this message . . t.t exa	1

my grandchildren love this water table . it very easy put together it sturdy . they play it until their hands prune up their mother drag them away it . grammy got point this gift .	1
we liked this toy got much use it over summer backyard my 2-year old son . accessories came it good . kids also used fisher-price little people made " water park " them table . plenty room imaginitive play this toy	1
i bought this item because i 2 kids , 3 18 mo . my 3 yr old fine kiddie pool , but i worried my little one . i figured this table would good him play water without worrying him falling :) my 3 yr old ended up loving it well . i even used it my unfinished basement when weather got too cold outside use . it great because you don't sand making mess out water portion like some tables . no complaints this product - very stable	1
this game lot fun . my kids ( 6 3 1/2 ) really like it both play it . it very fast-paced game similar slapjack , so it takes few times learn how play it , so it hard new player jump . kids love slap cards shout - it not quiet game . if you lose some cards , this game still very playable	1
i older version this game i use counseling/social skills groups elementary school . i am always looking games keep everyone engaged actively involved , slamwich fits bill perfectly . kids absolutely love it , especially when " sandwiches " disgusting ( e.g. , peanut butter onions ) . , even though game theoretically competitive ( player get all cards wins ) , kids usually enjoy game play so much they share their cards anyone who runs out . great fun , very entertaining	1
i'm not sure what other reviewers looking , but bottom line this product finger paint . it labeled finger paint , even though clear , it still paint product . it messy your fingers , like any finger paint , you should cover your surfaces- throw down some news paper or place-mat first . voila ! easy clean-up . said , i think it great product recommended age . my daughter started color wonder products 18 months . now , almost 3 , she actually enjoys them ( somewhat ) responsible them . we take marker sets everywhere : airplanes , restaurants , grandma house , stroller , etc . true , paint vaseline-like consistency , but traditional finger-paint like pudding anyway . color wonder finger paint clean up well , colors blend nicely create really interesting swirls colors ( think easter egg dyes ) provide hours fun age-appropriate child who handle waiting moment color appear . part fun anticipation magic picture show up . just try it , what could you lose	1
we moderate success color wonder markers , made next logical leap paints . don't it ! first all , your child start out digging their fingers all way into paint - it just human nature - so paints used up very fast . they'll empty little troughs within half hour . secondly , these paints almost messier than colored paints . these aren't hard-until-you-we t-t hem kinds paints you're used . these soft paints all way through , consistancy chapstick , just greasy . after rubbing paints all over paper , paper left heavy , greasy , transparent feel - days later , paper still not dry . weeks months later , paper still too disgusting pick up . yuck ! i agree prior reviews which site child lack creativity , etc ., but i think it okay just messy sometimes . said , this just too messy yucky deal . go get some water color pencils or better yet , stick grade-school acrylics	-1
i found item well made easy use . it clever idea my grandson enjoyed it lot . using amazon also plus , no crowds contend	1

polar express set really unique . train beautiful ; bell fun feature , i love way scenery works . it really clever , i think , snowman tree hold up houses . very unique distinctive ! tunnel , like brio mountain adventure figure 8 set tunnel ( which same shape but different coloration ) , beautiful but bit short . our maple landmark name train little engine could clearance issues it , but that pretty common since they're so tall . my big beef this set there no magnets engine . order connect engine train , one must hook engine its tender use tender connection . bit frustrating , particularly if you're kid who just wants hook train up . still , i said , this set very unique , its combination features makes it irresistible desipte drawbacks	1

i scared after reading reviews whe we origionally put this our wish list . but my intial thought\hope reigns true . this amazing set . i cant imagine how rough child would play this it fall apart every 5 minutes . unless pieces not securely fastened . it simple snap together system , meant taken down rearranged kids . design concept how they followed though , definately they earned 5 stars . i see younger kids taking awhile really able build castles themselves . my son perfectly happy letting us build castle him doing all playing right now . i see my 5 year old 3 year old practically sitting on\in toy worst " jail " bars get knocked over . i lifted it up carried it across room , very sturdy !! course i may see problem here if some " make up " sa castle dont pay attention building floor plates secured together wall systems . imo it sturdy when properly built snapped together . cant wait add more !	1

i think barbie looks fabulous her hot pink beach outfit ! it very hip trendy . my fave extra little bonuses come barbie like sunscreen ! i really appreciate barbie modest wearing lace beach cover-up ! this must low low price	1
i would never bought this item if i read other poor reviews first . toy made very cheap looking plastic it much smaller than it appears box . pieces just not fit like box displays them ( what appears large command center where transformer slide down wire just little over index finger long ) . i wish i could take it back but my son already broken couple cheap pieces . my 4-year old so disappointed because he could not stop talking how this would first toy he would play christmas day	-1

my daughter received these her 1st birthday . she loved them immediately , particularly enjoyed bucket they came . she would fill empty bucket , over over again , putting lid , taking it back off , trying other toys see if they fit ( your ball too big ! but look , block fits inside ! ) , putting beads into other containers ... you get picture . she learned lot these beads . now , 15 months , she just started able snap them together , getting whole new experience them . these one first toys she pulls out her play bin every day , they get played throughout day until it time put toys bed . while i agree these beads heavy , i find they stay together without problem ( but aren't hard her pull apart , either ) . me , they feel like good quality toys , you won't find them denting easily like cheaper snap-beads . i highly recommend this toy toddler	1

this game easy learn strategy develops longer you play . it doesn't take very long play growing potential expansions	1
when i first read description carcassonne , i dismissed it something i wouldn't really enjoy ( i've never really liked how luck dominant element tile-laying games ) . but there so many fantastic reviews mentioned how `strategic ' it , we decided dig into our game fund buy it ! it instant hit family friends including my wife daughter , who not avid game players . i won't waste time explaining rules or details gameplay , but i say learning game very easy . game plays half hour ( bit more expansions ) , which great because people come go they please - no long term commitments here . even adding `the river ' ( included basic game edition we bought ) `inns cathedrals ' expansion rules isn't burden . only area bit confusing scoring farmlands . we it incorrectly first night , but i re-reading rules clarify it , it became clear how they should scored . mechanics gameplay tinkered produce variations you may like . instance , we don't use standard rules placing river tiles beginning game . we shuffle all 12 tiles , picking laying tiles build river only until two ends ( spring lake ) placed . this way , length river ( 2 12 tiles ) varies one game next . tile laying aspect this game , course , mostly luck . there no strategy give you tile you need - you'll either lucky or not . one game , my son i both waiting finish cities near end game , needing identical pieces . he drew tile scored , i ended up zero city lost game . i drawn tile , i'd won . course , more players you , less chance you getting tile you really need . placing tiles carefully key strategizing . should you build bunch small cities , or lesser amount large ones ? should you finish road or try build it long possible ? should you expand your own farms , roads , cities , or `steal ' points player ? there no one strategy fail-safe ( least none i've found ) . strategy comes not only where tiles places , but also placement your followers (`meeples ' ) score points roads ( thieves ) , farms ( farmers ) , cloisters ( monks ) cities ( knights ) . since you only small amount meeples , so managing them wisely utmost importance . . when it all put together , these elements combine make fun unpredictable game different every time you play it . we purchased " inns cathedrals " expansion , which inns double value roads cathedrals score you additional points cities . but if those cities roads remain unfinished end game , whole city ( or road ) worthless ! this set also comes large follower ( worth 2 regular followers ) each color , complete set followers sixth color ( gray ) , `50/100 ' tiles make keeping score easier . there several other expansions carcassone , each adding twist here or there , well increasing number tiles . we hope add some those our collection over time , but we don't really find game lacking anything way it , either . while these expansions aren't necessary enjoy game , additional tiles , rules , strategies really modify game up nicely . there also `big box ' available which includes base game plus five expansions . i recommend this game highly . while i can't say it replace game nights taking out large board game 2-3 hour showdown , this game stands its ' own merits , fine game 2 5 players ( six i expansion ) . but more importantly , it kind game entice non-gamers into fold , every person i introduced game ( both gamers non-gamers alike ) loves it . carcassonne proof game doesn't massive or highly technical rules challenging fun .	1
my family i all love board games bought this after reading great reviews . it lived up all expectations . my husband read instructions easily explained game us . strategies quickly realized but varied . game different every time played under hour . this game comes free " river " expansion pack so you play or without . i like river better . game most fun two players , but we've played up four still good time . strategy changes more people	1

while i'm not big fan " deal or no deal " , i seen show understand why it overwhelming success nbc . game brilliant yet simple , fun watch . however , its even more fun play this handheld version not disappoint . even though unit comes instructions , interface very simple operate most users won't even need consult them . " old-school " lcd game , graphics sound obviously very simple , yet adequate enough convey all excitement dond . gameplay presentation well you need not fan show become addicted . this one most entertaining handheld games i ever owned ! my gripes product mostly minor . on/off button not responsive times , but unit automatically power down after five minutes idle time anyway . while batteries included , they disc-type ( lr-44 ) instead standard aa or aaa . aside these two insignificant issues , this product very enjoyable ... i'm admittedly not big fan dond . i only imagine how much more exciting it would someone who fan hit game show	1
we got this our son third birthday . he knows dinosaurs ' real names he his older sister play these hours ! i love how they sized they their own storage bin ... except throwing away boulders , which fit neatly into three year old mouth also kill your feet when stepped , we enjoyed everything this toy ! well worth money , very much recommended , i already told 5 other mothers them !	1
my 4 year old recently experienced " dinosaur month " daycare teacher bunch larger scale dinosaurs my daughter fell love . i couldn't find anything comparable any stores , so i took chance purchasing this item . i'm glad i they very comparable dinosaurs daycare . they look real very durable . it comes mat well plastic mountains , trees rocks so it allows her imagination go beyond just dinosaurs . i'm very pleased this purchase	1

sequence game i've playing over decade , am still loving it . friend introduced it my family during vacation when i teen . following christmas , both my mom i unknowingly happened give it each other gifts . we love gave so much we kept both them . i'm glad because i've able keep mine me i've moved around . now married , my wife become hooked we play all time . we live south america now introduced it friends we've made here . we literally get phone calls asking if we come over bring sequence us . it great because it so fun , easy learn , there no language barrier . i standard edition , so i don't know too much deluxe or jumber editions . but through years much i've played , folding board still great condition . also , i've read other reviews chips deluxe version painted white bottom easily show where sequences made . you if you want , but me , part strategy not let your opponent(s ) know you've already made sequence . if they don't see it , makes it easier you get your second one . so i think standard version just fine way it	1
we love this game .. it great ages 10 up .. nice family game include many people !!... concentrate entire board !! challening fun !	1
we've playing this game my family few years now we all love it ! it addictive ! we play prizes which makes it even more fun exciting . we players/teams age 12 up 80 years	1

i 1 year old girl 2 year old boy both them love this toy ! my youngest loves sounds it makes my oldest loves changing tiles over reveal new piece puzzle . they don't understand how make new picture ( flipping tiles until you get matching piece puzzle . there 3 puzzles ) but come time . it keeps them busy car which great , its educational because its puzzle , but it doesn't lots pieces would get lost . i think it totally worth money great itea !	1
i bought this toy my son when he 7 months old , he loved it ! it still his favorite toy - he 12 months old now . he used crawl over it pull himself up . now he walking , he make beeline it whenever he sees it . he loves little spot under cookie monster , he likes hide things there . he also likes press buttons front dance music . i found it pretty sturdy , since all chewing , pulling , banging , etc . haven't broken it yet . he now starting try climb top it , which problem , because it tip over . other issue sound really annoying . maybe it i hear it so much during day , but whole " eyes ! they help us see our friends " thing echoing my head while i try sleep . there off switch sound , but then my son gets sad elmo isn't talking him . overall , great toy	1
my child loved this toy . my only problem it , it tipped over easy . so i just set back up against wall or something kept eye my child .	1
since matchbox now mattel item , these same 24 car hot wheels cases found target every other year ( it seems ) . these far superior what hot wheels line right now . they " throw back " design black wheel they dreaded 100 car case wheels . both those allow cars bang around hard sides scratch them . these classic soft trays stack . even couple slots longer cars . exception ebay , this only place i've found this type case . excellent your redlines or latest pegs	1
yes , case itself made generric flimsy plastic they used make halloween costumes out back 80 . however , so far , i not any durability issues it . big selling point me , though , it included two plastic trays put cars . i first got hot wheels car carrier made solid plastic , but it not hold cars securely while carrying case , cars would move around inside scrape each other up . removable divider trays this case perfect not allow cars move all , even if you tip case upside down . i highly recommend this portable case	1
so we just got this gift christmas our 8 year old . took me almost 10 minutes get it " lick .

excellent game . i not want get console game system my son because i knew i'd never see him again . this game however gets him up moving .

my son this toy almost year used crayons every day since he got them . they still 1/2 their original size ! i really surprised some reviewers who said their crayons melting away fast because i amazed durability ours . maybe they haven't letting them dry out baths ?? my son no problem getting them out little fishbowl . only bad thing i say although my son loves elmo doll hasn't really captured his attention , i'm absolutely sure that just personality issue him . doll great shape , still looks like it when we first got it .	1
i don't know if this happened using hook hang dry elmo , but now his neck ripped half way around stuffing falling out . we using this toy 5 months , since my daughter got it christmas gift . she really enjoyed crayons even coloring elmo . crayons still holding up haven't worn down fast other reviewers said . she draw our bathroom wall , though , which not too pleasant side effect tub crayons . we plastic tub crayons not problem far staining goes . overall it nice while it lasted	-1

i love this new edition clue jr. it actually looks like clue now . my 5 year old little slow strategy , but she might better playing against kids her own age instead her older sister her parents . :) easy set up , no shuffling cards , you put each characters " stand " different time bottom it put different things room ( like plant or pool table ) stand beverage bottom it . extra time beverage stands go middle you try figure out what they . no one character so you move anyone around rooms making it more equal everyone . you don't hold any cards your hands so its easier kids keep track . still comes clue sheets places mark off what you find out .	1
finally i found clue junior version original clue atmosphere ! this version comes famous clue suspects classic looking board differnt rooms . it perfect game get my five year old daughter ready original clue she so curious	1

i purchased this snake my son 6th birthday . i am very dissapointed this item . starters , snake not move very easily . you make sure you only hardwood , even then , it somewhat difficult control . remote control very long antenna , which kids very careful . it unusually long such small remote toy ! also , second night he it , snake broke . we already problems last joint snake coming off . not big deal , it snaps back . but he playing this snake , it actually came apart . now , it only held together wires . my husband trying repair it . i saw toy break , our son wasn't rough it , it just very very poorly made . it not worth money buy . i feel i should come up birthday present our son , since this one barely lasted past his special day !	-1

my 5 year old plays these hours	1
mace windu legendary lightsaber unique due its purple crystals/blade . subsequently , one first force fx sabers i sought out master replicas this one . appearance elegant hilt not disappoint . one older force fx sabers , it slightly heavier/bulkier than newer ones , it takes 6 aa batteries instead 3 aa or 3 aaa newer ones . unlike typical blue , green or red force fx lightsabers , color not striking because they not use purple led lights . perhaps future , newer model , sleeker , lighter , brighter , purple leds made ... sound effects adequate , perhaps not sharp/crisp newer sabers . polycarbonate blade sturdy , good enough light-duty dueling . nevertheless , this one more unique designs ( master replicas often chided coming out sabers too similar design ) , entire line force fx sabers not really disappoint . star wars fans , force fx saber must your inner jedi ..	1
i've this dual disk more than year , this what i say : 1 . if you going play this item , you'd better make sure your friends one , otherwise it not much fun yourself . 2 . many people complain you cannot put cards protectors into slots , but you realize this would make it hard regular cards played . 3 . many item descriptions call this " dual disk launcher " " launches your cards . " i tell you right now this item not launch your cards , but it fold outwards " standby " dual mode , which might what they referring . 4 . people say your cards get bent , but not if you play them carefully . pros : ~ fun play friend who one ~ just like show ! ~ hold just all different types cards ~ it folds outwards into battle position ~ it life point countercons : ~ graveyard slot not hold very much cards i find myself haveing empty it place those cards aside while i refill it ~ graveyard slot very slightly too skinny fit width your yu-gi-oh cards , so cards get bent while they're it , but they come out fine end ~ dual disk " standby mode " not very compact : two halves hang out very far annoying . plus , it looks little silly standby , battle mode cool ( show 2 halves retract slightly , then extend out fold together) ~ deck zone doesn't hold ton cards , but if your deck reasonable size , not too big , it should fit just fine . overall , i am very pleased toy , i think some people critisized it little too much . it not easy make this sort thing into toy , i'm surprised mattel even it ( still it look cool ) . just remember either you'll want get 2 , or make sure your friend one , because these no fun themselves	1

i am 37-year-old artist mother 4-year-old . i , too , remember original , truly classic spirograph product -- originally manufactured kenner ( which part problem its current iteration , i suspect ) . call this current model " deluxe " cruel joke . i would recommend klutz product ( relatively new company sterling reputation quality , way ) instead . " spiral draw book " doug stillinger ( published klutz available through amazon.com)is not nearly elaborate old spirograph , all its cool , gimmicky-shaped gears . $19.95 , klutz product certainly more expensive -- but it works !! klutz says it " not intended children under 8 years " . my 4-year-old daughter require sustained assistance it , but she * loves * it . i , too !! marketing geniuses hasbro should pull their heads out their collective rear end tap into huge market nostalgia-tripping parents ( grandparents ) made up discriminating people like ourselves . if you still insatiable jones late-60s kenner original , go ebay !! you'll need deep pockets first-edition or " mint-in-box " versions , but you pick it up pretty cheap if all you want something original parts works .	-1

our family thrilled operation this toy ... it most interesting toy ( imaginext , k'nex , hot wheels ) we constructed so far . we got this toy markdown toy store , concluded it best deal we've ever gotten . construction : my 8 year old son needed little help build this , which 10 year old sister unable provide ( too hard find mistake , she not good spacial skills little bro ) . good spacial skills required , so recommended older kids and/or experienced builders . oversight : it took little parent correction complicated build ( checking firm clicking good angles ) tweaking ramp heights get this working perfectly feeling surprisingly stable . instructions fully detailed drawings steps , fairly easy follow , but little difficult tell orange red ( deducible length ) . operation : run three tubers fascinating watch ( least hour ... ' til bedtime ) . there only one ramp not quite enough slope * always * get tuber down , but he goes off himself ; occasional flips tubers upright bottom pool before lift helpful but not required ( 25% time ) . less than 10% time tuber flip cause tuber run off ramp . we've 2.5 hours operation without mishap ( once we tightened lift belt lift sticks ) so far , looking forward trying alternate build . we very impressed engineering ; particularly since we'd build our own machines scratch class assignments , kids know how hard it plan something actually works . reliability : cannot yet speak reliability , we haven't yet encountered problem . missing parts : unsure whether parts missing , or whether kids just lost two rods when tearing open packages . we able find same length color rods our other k'nex sets , there some " leftover " /replacement parts most pieces -- particularly unique pieces	1
i am 14 i could this very easily it worked great i reccomend it everyon	1
this premature overly ambitious design . my 7 year old gifted builder , worked several k'nex building models easily , begged something more challenging . when i bought this most expensive supposedly most advanced model toysrus , i expected it would give fun not only building , but also motorized operation box claimed . i totally disappointed . whole system appeared weak shaky , sliding connections not smooth , riders get easily stuck anywhere , or fall off . it not broken yet , but it never operate full round without some manual assistance . system also looks cheap clumsy . it now occupies big corner room , waiting disembled . we leave it there few more days , only sooth boy remorse his effort building it . my recommendation , buy it only if your life overwhelmingly happy , so you need balance it spending $80 buy few days frustration	-1

great thinking game " think fun " . i belong homeschool " strategy labs " group , which run former gifted talented public school teacher , she introduced me think fun games . my children thoroughly enjoy them , more patience than i would expected try solve puzzles . previous reviewer said this game good " gifted " children , i'm sure it , but i think it great game any child who likes solve puzzles , regardless their giftedness them . i would even buy this game ( or perhaps river crossing jr , or rush hour ) child who doesn't particularly like puzzles , because some adult encouragement , child may really enjoy it ( thus learning he/she like puzzles ) improve his ability think visually plan several moves ahead - quite nice bonus .	1
i received this game christmas , i hadn't even asked it . i absolutely love it . game consists main puzzle tray , plastic stumps , little magnetic man , 5 magnetic plastic boards different sizes , 40 puzzle cards ( ranging difficulty ) , carrying bag store everything ( which comes handy ! ) . this game really gets you thinking , you actually find yourself thinking ahead many moves . object game get little man one side river , other . you so , moving planks stump stump . sometimes you drop plank off convenient location , just pick it up later when you need it . i started playing it couldn't stop ! once you start getting hang it , you find yourself wanting continue you figure out easier puzzles . i must say , they become more difficult , you really need think ahead looking pieces you need towards " end " crossing . don't drag boards you don't need ( don't drop them places hinder your crossing ! ) . i definitely recommend this game people who enjoy puzzles , or games general . harder puzzles may too difficult younger child enjoy , they may get bored it . also- there many small parts could choking hazard small children . make sure you keep parts bag , keep it out reach	1

my eldest daughter received this gift when she month old . after four years love , use abuse , it finally wore out . let me tell you , three bedtimes it took get new one delivered very rough . if it not really dark her room ( like naptime , when sun peeks around her blinds lets little light ) , projected images harder see . when battery starts die , we see same thing - light isn't bright , images hard see . we also set it bookshelf ( 4 feet tall ) get brighter images . they aren't bright when low surface , like nightstand . what i think finally killed our first one , we would often overwind music box - point where inner mechanism would make awful clacking noise because it refused wind any more . although 4 years twice daily use pretty good run , we obviously trying bit more gentle this one , so we don't make emergency order when she turns eight	1
while playing this game first time , using less than one quarter supplied cards , our family found four cards incorrect answers . example , one card claimed grand prix races take place not road but oval track . claimed radar , not sonar , uses sound waves detect objects . spelled ebola virus quot ; boliquot ; . fourth card answer correct , but not only correct answer , claimed . makers this game would well hire fact checker	-1

this cute toy many small accessories not mentioned product description . each doll blanket , toothbrush pillow well mask coordinates her pajamas . there little dvds popcorn , cookies , soda , cups ( only three cups five dolls , though ) . if you three year old like i , cute accessories get lost within hour . these dolls not brushes their hair gets very frizzy quickly . shoes mule style fall right off . it might not easy tell racial variety dolls picture , but all but one white , other ambiguous race . living ethnically diverse community , i found this disappointing . all all , it very cute set many accessories it very good buy . forewarned very heavily packaged you spend least half hour freeing dolls accessories box . i would say this would more accurately 5+ instead 3	1

my toddler son loves anything wiggles thus , this dish set his favorite . he follows me into kitchen all time asking " where go-go ? " ( he calls wiggles " go-go's!)and just likes looking dishes ! i limit use them sometimes because often he'll just dump out plate or bowl just look wiggles ! cup also good helping encourage my son transition lid-less cup learn how drink something other than sippy cup . one draw back , though , set no matching flatware . i know you use any flatware , but matching set would also help encourage some toddlers learn use fork/spoon , too . anyway , must-have set die-hard fans !	1

we bought this jeep our daughter third birthday , after reading all reviews here , i very excited . it so easy put together took me hour assemble due many small pieces . my daughter little intimidated first , but after few minutes , she zipping around yard patio . ( still needs some work steering part) !! only two things i would work , 1 . flower decals lights little difficult peel off shift inconvient place . other than , it great !!! i would definetly get second battery so kids play longer periods time . but well worth small investment !!	1

i love this book , especially working pre-schoolers who typically struggling concept sharing - crayons toys snacks . i disagree some other reviews . rainbow fish loses friends first because he vain , snobbish rude because he thinks he most beautiful fish sea ( based upon external shiny scales ) . when he gives away most his scales , he learns greater happiness comes giving friendship than beautiful possessions ( scales ) . i especially like large version book which makes it easier share it groups kids .	1
give this ' book ' child should considered abuse . communist propogranda disguised innocent book fish .	-1
this best pirate ship i've seen . everything it speaks volumes great craftsmanship quality . this set includes everything you need pirate adventure , more . there quite bit assembly required . set aside couple hours , least . boat goes together extremely well . every part works like it supposed , they all fit together easily . result great-looking ship two masts , four sails , opening aft cabin , working winch intricately designed pully system . aft cabin features bed , table , benches . there also some room store some myriad accessories . staircase ascends main deck , ascends deck above cabin , where steering collumn . large grates floor deck open up , offering access ship hold . ladders ascend sides boat , offering our crew way get crow nest . there also optional weight attached bottom boat so it float water . i mixed feelings rigging sails . there lot it . fun string ! trying tie knots string isn't exactly my idea fun . ship didn't look bad without it . taken time assemble it , i say it probably worth effort . it certainly doesn't detract ship appeal . there rigging holds mainsails steady , string connects masts , one steadying forward sail . string also used winch anchor . assembling it all time consuming , but result pretty impressive . our swashbuckling crew three guys female pirate , latter which i find very appealing . how many pirate sets woman board ? all figures top-notch quality , although articulation leaves bit desired . straight arms only move back forth ( i think it would look more natural if their arms bent bit elbows ) . stiff legs move one . heads move left right , so wrists . figures all look great . their hats stay their heads . they also cowls , belts hold cutlasses or other items , cuff-links , neckwear . detail these guys great . now , here where this toy really sets itself apart rest . i've always fondness accessories . tools , weapons , animal friends ... stuff figures interact . well , there more accessories here than i know what ! sheer volume cool stuff here amazing . cutlasses , swords , rifles , pistols , knives , harpoon , barrels , baskets , serving tray , jugs wine , goblets , lantern , shovel pickaxe , spyglasses , accordion ... there varity fruit ! sack flour . treasure chest ( it nice locking mechanism ) . two manual-firing cannons plenty cannon balls . there more cannon balls here than i know what ! racks storing cannon balls . parrot . monkey . chicken coup three hens ! wow ! four rats . this impressive array accessories . my verdict : thumbs way , way up . they awesome job designing this ship outfitting it great crew loads accessories . i feel like i'm looking toy designer magnum opus . takes while assemble sort out all cool stuff , but it more than worth effort , definitely worth price admission	1
this toy classic ! i first got this ship when i 9 . i'm 28 now , would just much fun it now i then !! i plan building entire pirate kingdom very soon . playmobile tops my book . i wouldnt really recommend it kids , though , they might get cannon ball jammed up their nose or sumpthin'!	1

lots lots honeypots one first leappad books my son received , so it clocked good many hours play . story straightforward , easy young preschoolers grasp . although , it games really occupy my boy . there loads praise right answers , repeat question when answered incorrectly . i like this aspect play , it encourages learning . activities challenge children listen instruction , recognize items , follow through touching pictures pages . it difficult get 3-year old listen any great length time , but this toy promotes listening , focus . alone deserves decent rating me . i recommend this book children 3 up , but caution parents it may require some supervision . go button must touched every time you turn page , so leappad identify page . this alone may cause frustration . pages sturdy ; yet , little ones may get over anxious crinkle pages , or worse , tare them off binding . i've repaired few pages tape , but it not desirable . i don't any complaints lots lots honeypots ; however , i've discerned over 6-months time these books mastered quickly . if there more pages per books progressive learning i wouldn't cringe so much price tag . overall , i'm satisfied content this book . i recommend it young children who haven't mastered counting 10 .	1
nice book it keeps my little boy keeps busy following story game	1
bath time my son favorite part day . this product actully made him throw tantrum because he so frustrated . something i've never seen during bath time or art time ! basically paint doesn't adhere any surface wet . sponges work if parent carfully applies paint straight tube presses it part bath hasn't gotten wet . however , my three year old son could only get blob color if anything all . i would take this product back , but it given us family member . i think i'm going put it arts crafts area away bath . i'm sure it work better away water . this first review i've ever written . i wanted share my experience so others save thier money	-1

i got this game my wife x-mas . my family excited play it evening . game excruciating play . we average snl viewers seen most episodes some point time ( there reruns everyday ) , but questions too difficult . you would watch show 12 hours day take detailed notes get most questions righ t.t he dvd only plays few questions each catagory so when you use up questions it refers you back written questions . lastly dvd plays same few snl theme notes over over again . we pause game make it stop . we returned game following day	1

all but two pages book work just fine even if all cards missing . it might best if reviews based actual experience not assumptions made people who " almost bought book	1
my son received this xmas when he 18 mos loves it . we keep it his crib he always playing it . he wont go sleep unless he hears his elephant	1
this product very difficult set up due vague instructions . i struggled hour then after reading reviews online i discovered tip hooking it together prior inflating which makes all difference . you also understand how brackets work pushing them through past hard plastic piece then rotating 90 degrees . if hooks aren't properly place bed won't set up correctly . once set up , my 22 mo . old loves it , but even lots bedding she gets very cold which common problem all airbeds . surface always very cold touch we keep our house temp 74f . after her 1st 45 minute nap she woke up purple lips shivering . we lay lots blankets bottom top her , even though her crib she only needed bottom sheet one snuggle blankie . we also roll up few blankets mattress sides due 6 " gaps which small chid could get wedged into while sleeping possibly suffocate . it warning pkg not used under 3yrs age . now we'll make it work because she loves it so much would heartbroken if we took it down	1
we purchased this bed intention using it vacations , sleepovers etc . however , we soon came realize setting this bed up no easy feat . it comes four seperate inflatable pieces . you need first assemble footboard headboard which fitting plastic pieces into each other turning them . only problem they keep falling out . battery operated ( 4 cell batteries ) pump included painstakingly slow . even electric pump which we used , there many different air chambers need filled it quite time consuming . this bed not set up minutes they claim far taking it apart , fit it back storage bag you need completley deflate it . i would not recommend this bed somebody looking travel bed . we ended up returning it	-1
i think this toy not educational all . it way over priced it breaks really fast . it usless toy thjat expensive buy but cheap when it comes playing it . i bought one my little sister christmas two day after she playing it , it broke so i thought ok maybe she it so i took it told them whant happened then i got anonther one her then next day it broke so it really cheap toy my eyes . you might say ooh .... your sister too young playing it well my sister 14 years old . so my review pottery wheel	-1
while i wouldn't expect professional quality wheel child starter toy , i would expect wheel powerful enough least turn . even my daughter 7 year old hands well wetted lump clay proved too much resistance this wheel . it kept stopping dead slightest touch . lack power frustrating any child , making balanced bowl impossible . kids would better form bowls hand . we took this toy back	-1
easy bake oven great , i want career baking cooking , so this really helped . my little sister loves it well	1
grandma purchased this monkey my daughter her 1st birthday . it instant favorite she doesn't travel anywhere without it . i love when she put it down somehwere can't remember where it . she'll walk around house saying " monkey ... where aaaaare yoooouuu ??? " my daughter likes sucking tail so he get rather nasty smelly but luckily he washes really well stays relatively soft . monkey goes everywhere us , i thought one necessity . i accidentally got large version dangles when i pulled him out box handed it her , she stared it , picked up real monkey walked off . ( mommy think she could pull one over me ?? i think not ! ) so , since large monkey won't , i'm buying real monkey ... just case . i gave dangles 5 stars cause i know how much she loves him how happy secure he makes her feel . definitely worth 5 stars my book	1
i haven't any problems these ball pit balls . they very soft , which i like safety reasons . very brightly colored seem hold there shape very well . we haven't any them crush or dent . instructions say if they dent , place them hot water they should return their original shape . we're glad we purchased these . only reason they only got 4 stars because price . $19.99 too steep price , expecially considering 100 balls doesn't go very far . we bought 200 balls it doesn't even cover bottom our small ball pit . you definitely need lot balls make fun play . 100 seems like lot , but don't fooled . it not many you think ... toys us 100 balls $9.99 , which much more reasonable price , but i haven't purchased any yet , so don't know what they like ..	1
this game definitely amusing one play amongst group friends . buzzer adds perfect obnoxious factor arguing over tweaks rules trying get people get your point leads some very funny moments	1
though product says blocks suitable babies young 6-months , keep mind they talking how safe they ! not necessarily kid like them early ! ( they may they may not . ) i bought different set 6 blocks my daughter because * i * found them adorable . beginning , she just wasn't feeling them . even when she old enough hold examine them , i think i found them more interesting than she ! but ... after putting blocks out sight while , then pulling them back out , she much more love them ! remember kids develop different stages , not mention , they little humans simply different tastes interests ! my advice : don't write these blocks off not very good simply because your child doesn't like them . start one small set ( re)introduce it your child intervals . after age 12-18-months , they may into them whole lot more	1
i easily put this house together . it looks good kids love it . staircase not used becasue it keept falling off . very worth price .	1
my daughter asking large dollhouse since she 4 but we waited until we knew she would able take care it use it properly . we finally decided this dollhouse when we got it we found thing made cardboard particle board very few actual braces made real wood . there isn't enough hardware keep thing together it broke almost immediately despite very gentle use my mature seven-soon eight- year old . she devastated . i found much better dollhouse imaginarium almost same price this . me extra 10.00 worth it knowing my daughter dollhouse she actually use . please don't buy this dollhouse , you dissapointed . instead check out glitter dreams dollhouse or uptown dollhouse both imaginarium	-1

game , spelling primer , spelling practice " free all , " this overall good value money ( shop around : $5 - $15 range out there ) . couple big downsides when using letter cubes anything other than supplied cards : 1 ) many simple words cannot formed because needed letters same cube , 2 ) all letters not represented ( not " cool " when your child can't even spell out his own name ) , very limited 3 4 word cards ( trim 3x5 index cards supply your own cards , but make sure word spelled provided blocks ! ) it would nice additional letter cubes available , especially all letters !	1
my 2.5 year old son our 4 year old neighbor played this game almost thirty minutes tonight . i think long time young children . yes it teaching tool needs parent involvement , no , there no snazzy sound effects or anything fancy this game . it brain work , plain simple , good children . if you excited children follow your example blast ! our children jumped up down hugged each other every time they got word correct they worked together helping each other find letters . competition fun , but not needed good time learn . if you want help your child improve their reading skills or get jump start reading , this wonderful tool it way teach children learning fun .	1
this best game i ever played party . you not regret it if you buy it	1
i thought this game might horrible fact or crap game , but no way ! this hilarious !! it tame enough play my mother-in-law while same time dirty enough play my friends . like other reviewer said , you need plan your sips drink carefully . also , head bathroom before cards read . i look forward playing this game again again . love it	1

quarto given our family 5 ( kids ages 13 , 11 , 7 ) hours great play time . it challenging enough mensa adult easy enough our 7-year old play . besides warranting all awards it received , it looks lovely enough keep out quot ; artquot ; piece livingroom ... thus luring erstwhile tv viewers . company makes this also makes other games just fun attractive . i considered giving it 4 educational value because it doesn't go much farther than develop conceptual thinking/outside-the-box skills ( feat itself ) . scrabble might more quot ; educational . quot ; but its category , it definite 5	1

overall , great toy . our 2 y.o. son got it christmas , thrilled . however , he not satisfied boots wall sticker , so we go buy him separately , he not even close same size . he also got very frustrated dora diego kept falling over . we solved problem super gluing poker chips their feet- works like charm	1
my son , who loves dressing up harry potter capes like , loves this . so far , it durable , although he not terribly rough it . very funny watch it inflate	1
even though my son now lost interest this daily source enjoyment , 2 weeks he would spend 45 mins - 60 mins just running around house yard . price this if your kid any interest superheros , you can't go wrong . my son still grab this time time use his imagination it fullest . it definitely money well spent	1
first all , dark beginnings tight all , but sometimes i'm not lucky this pack ... only once while ... example , last week , i pulled big shield gardna ... personally nice card , but i bought 3 packs got only 2 holos ... other one coth woot ! it kinda worth it but basically you get crap	1

i am 18 recieved this set christmas .. believe me .. this not fragile toy if built correctly .. although i don't really approve way lego company decided attach forward rear ' round ' segments . landing gear , yes , they fragile indeed . but if you big hands like i , you should no problem getting them back . all i hold whole bottom ship , grey section ( imo : center weight ) bottom my palm . it took me all hour get this thing built displayed . i like this one so much more then original lego released . escape pod more ... realistic ? occupants not going die oxygen starvation . it lot more parts then original . i think it cool way if correctly , you effectivly take whole ship split it two .. if you jedi minifigures .. you use space assembly above boarding ramp ( grey 6x4 plate comes off reveal space just big enough 3 or 4 lightsabers)i love this set	1
i think this best lego set your toy store thank you	1
if you love trivia james bond films , this dvd game younote this game before daniel craig became new bond . so i guess you stuck just five bond already out there . this dvd game hard trivia game even truest bond film fans . it game you not need board , you just play it dvd . it great just one or group . . you know before you watch bond film friend , round scene it would great bit enjoyment . this game good 8 89 this game fun , just totally funbennet pomerantz audioworl	1
this lightsaber really look feel like " real thing " . it wows everyone who sees it . it quality realism actually match my vader costume much better than popular $9 saber you see everywhere . my only complaint mechanism detects motion seems lag quite bit , sound effects often several seconds behind your action , sometimes coming after motion already stopped . still , if you $100 spend really cool toy you would killed when you 8 years old , go it !	1
ever since i first saw luke power up his first lightsaber episode iv , i knew i wanted one my very own . this replica closest i'll ever come , i say , it well worth my money . my brother , sister i each one , we're all very pleased them . craftmanship remarkable these things ! they all made metal some plastic rubber very high quality . this anakin skywalker replica feels very solid my hand--it same weight mace windu slightly lighter than single darth maul blade , but anakin feels most comfortable my hand ( not say others all uncomfortable though ) . we dueling ( carefully ) blades lately , they held up surprisingly well some fairly solid clashes . however , manual clearly states these not designed dueling , nor they toys . what they cool hell . side note , blue red sabers shine much more vibrantly than purple , all blades look much better low lighting conditions .	1
anakin skywalker ep . iii fx lightsaber essential star wars collector . lightsaber butt end handle tip blade very well made . blade made very durable plastic handle alumium(forgive misspelling ) . powered aa batteries , lifespan one set batteries impressive length . sound effects great , i love power-up power-down feature , which incorprated light sound . although , this patictular lightsaber birthday gift , i own three fx lightsabers myself . i am impressed satisfied all them . thank you	1
i love this game i hate sing , how ironic !!! only bad thing timer allows 20 seconds only , we bought minute timer make game little longe	1
okay , these games cheap but not excuse how bad they . xmas my wife bought me two titles endless games ( family feud deluxe encore ) . both horrible . it seems if people endless games skimped everything possible keep game cheap produce possible . instructions appear written 13 year old . i would not recommend either these anyone would instead spend few extra bucks get game some thought behind it	-1
it looks really cute , im saving it x-mas though . polly her friends going love sleigh . pieces small so if you little ones careful . my daughter just getting into them . because small pieces her brother getting older . so she it now good price it free shipping rock	1
i'm gearing this review mostly people who grew up transformers 1980 would either like relive their memories or introduce their kids same things they enjoyed . if you're not familar original bumblebee character or toy , then nutshell i'll say " yes , it cool , your kids like it ! " okay , now old school fans ... reviewer mentions , volkswagen no longer allow hasbro produce toy molds likeness their cars , because they don't want their vehicles thought " war toys " . when lot transformers fans heard new bumblebee figure going released something other than vw bug , they shuddered . i one them . however , this figure really won me over . car mode so-so , i'll admit . it not only not bug , it not any " real-life " car . i also didn't like all white it because i'm used bumblebee all yellow vehicle form . i'm also not big fan trailer/wave crusher . i don't think it adds anything because while it transforms into jetpack , it takes 3 years change it over jetpac trailer , doesn't seem stay hitch well . other hand , robot form out this world . this bumblebee how long-time fans always hoped he'd toy . he very posable lot fun . he bends all over place , you twist flex his legs arms into all sorts positions . either way , i think he good buy , whether it sentimental purposes or your kids play .	1
my granddaughter 3 she actually pollys magnetic clothes . this great value	1
i would not recommend this globe . i bought this my 3rd grader first day using it , equator peeled off !! i thought keeping it anyway but decided deal hassle plan returning it . it also feels too flimsy fall over easily	-1
i paid twice much , i wouldn't happier this product . it much easier use more complete than flat map . it great value money	1
i so excited see this sale , especially after seeing picture baby inside toy under customer photos . when it arrived , i very disappointed . picture clearly larger version this , it doesn't tell you . this actually quite small . when i ordered , there no dimensions listed description , i'm not sure if they changed it . it only 15 inches tall wide . also , toy isn't really great . bead thing neat , but sliding puzzles sides pretty pointless you only slide them inch . music drum thing attached very short cord , so it hard use it xylophone . it relatively durable though , made nice wood , so it probably last . but then again , my son barely plays it , so he wont chance break it anyway .	1
this monitor so much static ! we would always move it all over our bedroom just find good spot . sometimes you hear other babies crying ! when it comes through our monitor we can't tell if it our baby or not ! then top it off , cord broke so we ended up tape it monitor keep it plugged . otherwise it would unplug itself we would wake up morning find it off ! only good thing this product lights but you find other ones . don't waste your money .... keep looking	-1
my daughter ( age 4 ) loves this toy -- especially fact you wrap seaweed around make different rolls . also , knife big favorite . only drawback felt pickled ginger keeps getting lost ...	1

service great , delivery quick , but product just good . box nice tin box , card holder high quality , but actual cards flimsy won't last very long .	1
my husband family always plays phase 10 when we get together . it longer game you get chance chat , eat , drink while playing game . we enjoy it . we games stretch over couple days . doesn't take any real talent , just fun game play group	1

i purchased this car my 4 year old son . when car shaken it makes real engine reving sounds , it allows enough time little children put car down floor before it takes off . it go very far . it works much better hard surface than carpet . we created some ramps out cardboard car jump , it actually gets up enough speed jump ramps . this fun car . i would say only draw back little kids won't shake car long enough it go very far . when my husband i shake it we get car go great distance further than our kids .	1
i got this car my 2 years old nephew , he loves it , colors bright , noise its makes movemensthank yo	1

our 6 yr old enjoying this product . she needs help getting quicker drilling addition subtraction this helping . she likes when green light lights up tell her she correct . levels very good since my niece ( 8 yrs ) , nephew ( 10 yrs ) adults all tried it . if it durable enough , it should last her years she gets multiplication etc . she doesn't think it fun though - it just something when she bored . this reason we keep it van . our plan working though because she climbs into her seat immediately turns it . we it our home awhile but there too many other fun things besides math ! if your child enjoys challenging math facts , they think it fun though - our 8 yr old niece so myself my husband	1

my son loves backyardigans we've now begin collect all five stuffed animals ty ( he began tasha since he loves hippos ! ) . tasha girlish yellow hippo flair dramatic . she often plays lady tasha manor or volcano princess ! well-stitched adorable , ty version tasha her wearing non-removable dark orange dress flower motif -- well fabric shoes ( also non-removable . ) distance , ty backyardigans may look like they're made rough , itchy fabric -- but they not . fabric soft smooth -- somewhat like chenille . if your child loves backyardigans , enjoys fantasy play ( like tea parties or role playing ) , or perhaps needs friend keep him/her company bedtime -- tasha would make wonderful present	1
this my little grandaughter - who never watched backyardigans . i gave her tasha she just loved her . she now watching show faithfully . my grandaughter loves dance so we always see her dancing tasha during shows	1
i'm my second soothe surprise nature light because first one squeaked so loudly . amazon replaced it quickly but moving parts second one also started squeaking . first it quiet i decided i'd just live it , but noise gradually got louder louder . it too late return amazon so i contacted v-tech e-mail followed their troubleshooting instructions . when didn't work , i called them . only way they replace it if i send back mine first . since i can't get my baby sleep night without it ( despite noise ) i really need replacement first . they not willing bend this policy even when i offered give my credit card number so they could bill me if they didn't receive replacement back . i guess i'll just keep it hope my baby continues enjoy listening squeaking ! despite all , i like toy . my baby didn't take it instantly though . it start act flaky when batteries start getting weak , so check first if you're problems it . but i can't recommend it others two now squeak so loudly .	-1

this cutest little baby carriage . our two year old daughter got it christmas . our daughter uses it corolle lila baby doll , which i also highly recommend . carriage fits up 17 " doll ( snugly ) very sturdy . i like fact bed part lifts out baby basket , it nice stroller fold up like real one . my complaint - bed part not fastened well enough . there two velcro pieces sides , one back , two snaps . that it . i would liked there little more holding it , because when kids push baby down carriage , it tends sag . i probably add some more velcro my own front carriage see if it helps . my two year old daughter not stay stroller herself , but if we take her carriage her baby lila , she pushes her baby stays right me . we get lot comments how cute she how cute baby carriage . i recommend this toy would purchase it again	1

i've playing scrabble almost 2 years now , i profess completely know only 2 3 letter words . scrabble really expands your vocabulary , but don't expect it use them daily life , or more commonly , not know meaning all . you see , achieve scrabble ' cramming ' , top players rarely , if ever memorise word meanings . they memorise them utility . so while you may triumph many word game , it not significantly improve your english . fact , 2003 world champion panupol sujjayakorn admitted his english still poor spite what must massive vocabulary numbering over million . i highly recommend one scrabble dictionaries , cut out those niggly disputes when person invents insists word exists . i myself use collins 2005 edition . among word games , this king . just don't waste all your time memorising words - there better things out there . really :)	1

just description says , marvel universe yours ! using square colorforms every imaginable marvel character spiderman venom spidergirl . bad guys , good guys , superheros you've never heard ( scarlet witch ?? ) ! there only 20 characters you need select put board , but over 100 characters choose . you name it , they're there : hulk , dr. octopus , red skull , silver surfer , iron man , fantastics , x-men ! it take little while setup , but it fun everyone sit around deciding who gets go board . once they're board , you decide keep same lineup several games , or go back make minor adjustments . maybe dr. doom shouldn't expensive spots ... maybe replace him professor . you also obviously need take heading character put it property cards . example if spiderman put boardwalk space it referred space# 40 ( 40th square board ) . there colorform word " spiderman " you need put onto blue property card space# 40 . chance cards called " thwppt ! " " snickt ! " . only bad part these they obviously refer " space #40 " or " go space #12 " rather than saying " spiderman " or " go hulk " . tokens cool : spider-man , ghost rider , phoenix force , silver surfer , kingpin , wolverine . railroads replaced flying machines . utilities replaced dr. doom mansion x-men place . money same ( except pictures spiderman hulk them ) you still collect $200 when you pass go , or go jail , free parking . i kind wish they would spiced those spaces up bit more . least picture dr. octopus jail ( spaces all traditional pictures regular monopoly ) . it brings whole new dimension though monopoly . really fun . you feel like you're playing different game each time	1
my husband i bought this some friends ended up opening it staying up hours just reading cards eachother . some sick twisted some gross but some start really indepth conversations . then some just make you laugh till you cry . they divided into catergories such eating , pain , embarassment , ethics . we haven't actually played game rules but just cards worth it .	1

it got bells -- whistles ! plays train sounds clack clack bell sound train crossing . you wind up track train manually , put train it away you go . i love fact this toy not battery-eater like most his others , it double duty block-building table , too ! alex 17 months still plays this ; we got it him 9 1/2 months . he loves take top off sit it , or sit floor his knees front it use inside area little table eat snack off . he his own table chairs , but sometimes he prefers use this . there no songs play , none advertised , despite previous reviewers comments . there two versions this table available -- this one , so-called new , improved , electronic , musical version , which i think pales comparison this original . who needs one more musical toy everything but allow kid use their imagination play ? not me ! if you want good old-fashioned toy , your kid love long time stand up type use , get this . you'll glad you . i only wish i could find more plastic blocks come this themselves , rather than playsets sold separately	1
this compact , easy use game . it not anyone who already basic math skills . i bought it help my eleven year old son improve his i when i received it i realized it geared more first time math students . i ended up giving it my grandchildren who 6 4 . it more age appropriate them	1

we gave this our granddaughter(who 2 years old september 20th)at her birthday party yesterday she likes it alo t.t he screw battery compartment fairly small , but we no trouble getting it open using small phillips head screwdriver . puzzle itself thick looks durable , pictures well sounds fairly decent	1

good king looking someone take over throne he no children . he decided ask people locate magic treasure prove their worth . board made up twisting branching paths lead village , through forest , into castle . cards used determine what king looking . card scene popular fairy tale picture desired object . players move their pieces through forest looking trees . each tree pieces treasure hidden under it . players landing tree get secretly look treasure . once they know where desired treasure , they head castle tell king . first player successfully find three desired treasures wins game . magic also used game . certain rolls dice , players teleport any tree their choosing , go castle gate , or randomly change desired treasure card . movement little different than most games . two dice used but they not added . instance , roll 5 4 get you nine spaces but it also get you five spaces one direction four . this way 4 5 used move one space . thus subtraction skills become important addition skills . while my two kids love game ( ages four seven ) it elements make it palatable adult well . check it out	1
my daughter loved this game since she six years old . craftsmanship game itself beautiful . game-pieces little trees wooden , illustrations old-fashioned fairytale variety , very intricate colourful . cards good , thick cardboard stand up years use . it looks like very old game one would find attic trunk . winning depends such variety strategy , memory , just plain luck combination ages play concurrently feel equally challenged . i recommend enchanged forest highly . it feast colours , delight behold touch , it provides good mental exercise . what more could you ask	1

shape swing , curved like sling , makes my 2-year old son slide down . he can't sit up straight slides into slouch . colder weather , when he wearing more than light jacket , bulk jacket makes it impossible even get him stay swing . since there no way him sit up straight slide his rear end back ( even without jacket ) , he ends up right edge swing when wearing jacket , his body basically straight position which causes him slide right off . plus , harness straps not very long when adjusted their maximum , so heavier jacket they don't fit . i'm not talking big child here either . 29 months , my son still only weighs 25 pounds . i'm taking this off our swingset getting little tikes toddler swing	1
i bought this swing put new variety climber swing set extension we just bought . my 7 month old 22 month old fit perfectly it . when my best friends 20 month old boy came over try out new play set he just bairly fit . he not overweight toddler , just tall muscular . there no way bigger kid would fit . so i am going tomorrow buy little tykes high back toddler chair our bigger guests . one really nice feature this chair it 5 point harness belt . really comforting . i really feel my babies safe sitting it .	1
there nothing like waking up 2am few nights row voice saying " o olive " . keep mind it takes you few moments before you correctly determine it puzzle talking , not intruder or " voices " you now hearing . ( i completely panicked first two times ) . it keep repeating phrase 20+ times ( i counted ) , so you get out bed , middle night look screwdriver , so you take out batteries , because there no off switch	-1
these playmats fantastic . they cushion yet sturdy durable . my son chews these mats like candy yet they kept their shape . they great little new crawlers need alittle padding resistance their little knees . [ ... ] just warning new parents thinking playmats . we three sets ( large family ) these our favorite far . all other sets we shapes numbers them come out . it huge pain when our son plays w/ these mats because you end up your knee trying find missing pieces all time . save your back , money , time just buy whole pieces without all fancy decor ( letters , numbers , animals , elct . ) comes out , they just end up missing or other side room out mat you pick up figure out where it goes mat . also pieces get old when you move mat around all pieces fall out everywhere , everytime you move it you put whole puzzle back together .	1
we knew we needed something our little one play , this what we needed , thus bought . it bit thicker than multi-colored ones . she fallen her head without hurting herself . it , however , get expensive , we buy 3 sets cover her small play area . but we can't put price her noggin	1
we purchased this wagon after reading other positive reviews . our little two year old girl loves it . it probably bit big her , but it didn't take her long crawl . it took her little longer ( couple falls ) learn get back out . she loves riding it gathering things our " nature walks " bring back home . she also pull it herself . solid construction very easy put together .	1
my daughter just loves this wagon ! we rented it local amusement park she not want get out . we knew we one . we loved fact it actual axle easy turning . our previous wagon wheels directly connected wagon super hard turn . they would get stuck sideways you could not get thing move . this only plastic wagon we could find front axle which made this top choice us ! this great choice children too old stroller but too small walk . we loved storage underneath cup holders . we also like it holds two children plenty room all their stuff !! lastly , we loved surface flat so children nap if they tired !! (our last wagon seats each end so this not option)*we planning buying attachable umbrellas offered radio flyer this summer protect our little ones sun ( great plus !	1
this wagon fantastic . you fit 2 - 3 kids it , plus put food it . there cool hidden compartment you flip up . it fits 6 cans soda . this wagon also comes cup holders . we've used it zoo which perfect especially if you like bring food . we've used this go park , too . it largest wagon available	1

my three year old loves her new fisher price " ipod " . she loves pink color choose her favorite songs icon pictures(a great feature ) . my only complaint volume its highest level still very low which makes it difficult her hear while riding car interstate while traveling	1
screws pain screw little screwdriver they provide , but when i tried power drill , it stripped screws no time . so i went back manual screwdriver two blisters later , i think it really quality easel , storage space excellent idea . most easels just don't seem worth space they take up . wheels great idea take it outside when weather nice ... makes easy transport . overall , i am very satisfied this item , but i agree other reviewer cheap screws	1
balls added ball pit . i expected balls bigger not remember dimensions listed	1
i bought this my husband who absolutely loves golf ! plus i thought it would cute fun . overall product what i thought it would he thinks it great . my only problem , if you even would call it , display hard read . you know triangle thing " answers " all your questions , well it sometimes little hard read . it looks great my husbands " man-cave " goes well his other golf stuff . i would recommend it anyone who humorous side love golf .	1

if you thinking purchasing this car , note seat small length pedals short . thefore , it suited small children . description says children 3+ , but when our 4.5 year old ( who very small 4.5 ) tried it out , it way too small . it extremely difficult our child pedal comfortably . it alot interesting buttons sound effects , but i would say based size seat length pedals this more ideally suited children 3 or 4 only .	1

first all , yes markers stain , so keep mind when your children sit down play this . good news stains come out . those you problems try adding whatever clothing stained bucket hot water ... pour 1/4th -1/2 cup hydrogen peroxide into bucket let sit 30-45 minutes . stains come out .. this product excellent pre-schoolers who interest drawing . i love trace mechanism this quite frankly it one best " trace " teaching tools i've seen . children love " flourescent " look it hard get this away them ! you also add pictures them draw making your own ..... just use white crayon or marker highlight picture voila you more pictures ..	1

works well enough once your kid pedal themselves , although both my kids tipped it plenty times . steering bar isn't effective . it too much give prob fact it designed collapse . plus it doesn't actually steer bike ( some fancier models this option ) . pin lock handle bars doesn't always stick . there no brakes this thing . good pushing your kid around when they haven't figured out concept pedals . dangerous if your kid old enough ride themself goes careening down hill because they can't stop don't want use fred flinstone braking method . not worth money , imo	-1
my son 2 half this his first bike . he looks adorable bike but unless i want go over help him he can't seem manage his own . why ? well darn trike impossible steer one secondly it tips over very easily . it really unsturdy . also what up no breaks ? this cute bike take some pics looking cute but serious bike riding .. forget it ! -mom orlando ,	-1

my daughter loves this little radio flyer tricyle !!! she rides it around house constantly it seems sturdy well made . great buy	1
looks nice , but remember this inexpensive toy . so stamped steel pieces hardware show their " made china " origins . front wheel not true ( straight ) , thereby making aligning handlebars front fender wheel impossible . very aggravating . so handlebars now straight reference frame , but front wheel tilts over tiny bit , front fender sits crooked . that best compromise . paint seems nice , though	-1
thank you your prompt mailing little mommy shopping cart . it received good condition	1

my two-year-old daughter loves her computer ! we started 1-3 software- one came it , let imagine home hunt . those more interactive it seems than 3-5 software , but she really enjoys world colors anyway . she thinks it funny make purple banana . only negatives older software use word " dummy " " move " review mentioned . also , world colors just one level . younger software provides more variety levels . software comes overlay frustrating you your toddler first . my daughter wouldn't leave it keyboard first but after couple times learned accept it use it appropriately . now she knows which overlay she needs which game . all software easy change into language which great reinforcer her spanish class well . rude comments software actually opened up discussion her what would better say or what nice what not . my daughter spends least hour it each time she sits down it which once week ( i don't allow her use it more than twice week ) . main thing it reinforces colors shapes creates fun environment holds her attention . plus , she loves control happenings . i don't feel guilty setting her front it while i try get something else because it provide some learning . it better than just watching tv show , but course never compare human interaction .	1
my son 22 month old he absolutely loves it . he literally not want go bed wants play morning soon he wakes up . we set his computer his desk our office , now mom , dad , son play/work computers together . he finds it amazing this " big tv " actually responds him when he hits keyboard . right away he started repeating words , became more interested expanding his vocabulary watching our every move too . i bought let imagine birthday party . some cds choice portuguese , which my first language . he speaking both english portuguese , softwares helping his language development . he not stay front computer too long , he very active needs always moving . but he lot fun 10-15 minutes time he plays it . i strongly recommend younger toddlers .	1
i got this product my 2 year old granddaughter christmas . she lot fun it while i let her play it . however , soon i heard thewords " move " instead excuse me please , sun calling moon " dummy " . it . we taught our granddaughter polite . she says please , thank you , excuse me . i think this toy teaching wrong things small children . they learn rudeness soon enough school , they don't need learn it home	-1

money , gears great . gears wear out kids manually turn gears opposite way .	1
my son enjoyed this toy since i got it him 15 months old . he couldn't turn it off himself til maybe couple months later , but he liked playing w/ gears . now when he plays w/ it once while , he usually leaves it running , but we haven't change batteries very often . not sure why it rated 3+ , probably small size stickers , but smallest gear 1 1/2 " diameter would pretty tough choke . it well made . stickers haven't peeled off after lot handling magnets firmly place . gears turn very smoothly . it works great fridge or magnetic dry erase boards	1
we believed this greatest purchase our twins it offered two seats , extra cup holders , storage . then one my sons ( 18 mos . ) stuck his finger hole designed canopy . we could broken his finger after attempting grab him ( screaming ) out wagon without knowing it lodged . i called radio flyer since it very scary difficult remove my son finger . i liked this wagon very much decided try it one more time , but my kids still too curious holes . plus their fingers not getting any smaller . now wagon going back radio flyer . company offered pick it up full refund . radio flyer so far treating this isolated case . company not currently recall wagons canopy holes . my issue still suppose escalated throughout radio flyer executive management . so there might future design changes , but not now . i cannot imagine this issue isolated problem . canopy nice use really sunny days , but not all time . nothing else could used plug ( 4 ) holes since may pose choking hazard . we're very bummed giving up wagon , but it makes sense safety reasons .	-1
this great wagon- easy handle , my girls love it ! i 18 month , 4 year old , they both fit very comfortably- lots room spare maltese dog we have- though top could made sturdier , little more coverage- but all all it worth money sure	1
i bought frog habitat before doing any real research into frog keeping , now i feel i wasted money i would deprived my daughter actual learning experience i continued use it . i ordered " free " tadpole ( $7 shipping/handling fee ) . it came four weeks later mail . i put it habitat following directions it lasted maybe 4 hours . they promptly sent replacement which lived slightly longer . heartbreaking my daughter . i've since learned kind tadpole they send notoriously difficult care age . i later bought same kind tadpole , but much older , local store it conventional aquarium filter aeration . boy , sucker hardy compared what they sent ! i put frog enclosure away . i may use it crickets or something . kind tadpole they send leopard frog . leopard frogs jumpers . based my research , habitat really too small this kind frog . i since built terrarium my daughter i plan house current tad when it reaches frog stage . it nice green plants dirt rocks . short , it much more appropriate home frog . we lot fun building it we got talk environment how things depend each other . much more educational it prettier look . also , this thing leaks if you get any water plastic layers , which very easy when you fill it	-1

my daughter ( 9 time ) received this last year absolutely loves it ! she started building it one day finished next , instructions easy follow she loved building process more than playing it end ! she built other 2 rides well , but enjoys ferris wheel most	1
nothing beats original . this one pretty good , but not near sturdy . plastic parts slip , so you just need extra careful when making your designs take it slow ! other than , my 7-year-old like it	1
my poor 9 year old daughter used her own money buy this item they didn't even work first time she tried them !!! they absolutely no reception worthless !!! don't waste your money !!! if i could given it zero stars , it would gotten zero stars !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
these great . my 4 yr . old grandson loves them . we older set smaller blocks decided add these . we also bought 40 pc . set . they good quality , sturdy blocks . he just so much fun building towers , garages , houses , etc .!	1
my 3-year old boy plays these blocks often . they roads , towers , support race track , buildings , etc . they easy put together , after figuring out first one . i like fact they no batteries encourage imaginative play . great tool stay-at-home-mom	1
my son who 5 , loves pretend he got one christmas . he loves it so his friends . there feature it you calculate . very cool	1
my daughter loves little mommy dolls , asian hispanic harder find , but amazon made it easy , this great price . her collection now complete	1
i just bought this doll my 4 year old daughter . i found it very difficult find doll brown hair brown eyes wasn't african american doll . this doll also very comfortable carry little girl . it isn't too big or too small soft body she smells sweet . my daughter over moon her new ' baby ' looks like her . she carries her new " baby anna " ( her name this doll ) everywhere acting like quite little mommy . this fantastic doll thank you fisher price realizing not all little girls blonde hair blue eyes	1
vmigo everything promises be- virtual pet . i bought two , one my 6 1/2 year old daughter , one my 11 year old sister . they both love them . very simple set up , very simple learn use . my only complaint handheld piece not very easy see screen , not easy turn off . said , i am happy this purchase !	1
i bought this my son christmas he really likes it . better than getting real dog , least now :) note - it took while get hang working docking station . when we first connected it turned it , nothing happened . there little led light would not come no matter what we . i almost given up it when my son re-inserted game into it today light came . then we played around figured out game powered up totally ' play ' mode ( not just powered up ) it work correctly . docking station makes world difference , especially my 40 year old eyes - can't see thing tiny screen ! instructions come it next useless ( company web site just bad ) , but i've come expect when buying fairly cheap items overseas	1
i purchased shake go mater race track lightening mcqueen . my son loves playing it . we get it go around racetrack four times	1
this little car wonderful . my son loves it won't put it down . we also lugi car . he plays them together absoulutly loves it . i would recommend it anyone . he almost two it safe him play .	1
game itself kinda silly but questions thought provoking times gross . great fun those like thinking outside box	1
my kids love die cast cars these disney/pixars just success here	1
my 9 month old twins love this ! music fun ( you adjust volume high or low ) , although they can't quite get blocks holes yet , they love pushing doors make music go . two blocks rattle texture perfect teething . real favorite since santa delivered this christmas ; two months later daily play , they still intrigued	1
this great toy . it volume control which nice feature . baby loves sounds lights always surprised when he opens barn door . makes great gift	1
after reading reviews here i figured it worth taking chance price . most time all mine slop lot solution everywhere . sometimes it would make one bubble would float couple feet die . i would advise caution one respect if you decide buy one these . bubbles consist lot solution one popped my 4 year old nephew he got it his eyes which stung enough make him cry . lack it creating bubbles even more disappointing him . personally i don't think there any good bubble makers out there . latest toy i bought my nephew starts out fun but ends up making huge mess after 10 minutes using it	-1
my son received this his 3rd birthday after seeing commercial nickelodeon asking it every time he saw commercial . it really neat , actually makes huge bubbles like commercial , its easy . my 3 year old no problem holding wand opening it letting wind blow bubbles out . warned though , this kind messy . wand so long huge when you dip it into container bubble solution it drips quite bit . so adult supervision needed smaller kids . i usually hold container let him dip wand into it . but he loves toy , he loves chasing bubbles . haven't run out solution yet , its only few weeks , but probably just make our own when it runs out . overall i think this good toy get kids up out house , which kids need more today . its inexpensive , fun whole family	1
this absolutely worst babyproofing product we ever wasted money time ... like other reviewers , we cleaned contact points suction cups until they gleaming it just wouldn't stick . we tried it 3 different toilets , all which slightly different design , it instantly popped off all three . my 6 year old now uses it rescue tool his rescue heroes ..	-1
i bought this my son christmas just something different . we played this most ! i knew nothing them so snapping them together all different ways creative fun . then we realized they make noise when snapped together certain way they slide open extend then push back small . they make joints similar ball join t.t he learning/creativity just goes . my son made patterns , art bugs . i highly recommned this toy	1
my kids ** love ** this game ! i ordered " yo ! sacramento " same author , we found it extraordinarily easy learn states capitals . but , he still hard time remembering where states . this helped great deal , it loads fun	1
my kids love this game , learned so much united states . there 50 state cards , even more game cards . everyone receives 5 state cards , then game card read which say something lines , " touches pacific ocean ; capital 4 syllables ; nickname plant or animal it ; etc ... " first player call out appropriate state his hand wins round . it amazing how information sticks young minds - i admit i look enclosed map every time card ' touches tennessee " comes up , but even my 4 year old scan his hand almost instantaneously call out correct state - if he one . kids love this game so much they want design their own game cards add game ! someone else noted , reading skills helpful , but my 4 year old didn't let deter him ( although when he started playing this game he strong pre-reading skills ) . i also recommend book scrambled states america - this game plus book would make nice present child up through 2nd-3rd grade .	1
i used this game many groups 5th graders fun activity conjunction their study states . kids actively engaged , using enclosed map locate specific state , reading cards learn state capital , nickname ... after few playing sessions , students become more proficient knowing state location it capital . each time game played , there different outcome , unlike typical board game where everyone follows same path . playing cards duplicate same quirky , whimsical illustrations laurie keller " scrambled states america " book . game fast-paced ( avg playing time 10-15 mins)and students love it so much they often want stay during recess play some more !	1
this tamagotchi so cool . it tends more needy than others very sensitive different tyeps food . it loves play games . if you get this tamagotchi it soon get job so i highly recommend banker . i not taken my eyes off this tamagotchi since i got it . somtimes i acsadently neglect my tamagotchi . you buy this item amazon or " toys us	1
my second grader loves this puzzle ! he put it together several times since christmas . wood base shows capitals , but not states or their shapes , so he really learning where each state goes starting even learn capitals . would recommend ages 7-10	1
thought this would provide fun my 12-year-old her crew valentine day , but product arrived three days after holiday ( 10 days ship even though it stock ) when you shake it turn it over see answer , you barely see words . sounds like something inside broken , but i'm not going bother returning it this point . it thought counted . cute idea , but execution me lackluster	-1
okay , tried this out five seven year old . both them tired it within fifteen minutes . i mean , how many " snowflakes " person make	-1
i've sea monkeys before never lasted long . i got this one , after 6 months they all died . but i completely forgot tank , so i never flushed it out . two weeks went , suddenly there tons babies ! it happened few times now , they all die , but after while , new ones born . i've it year half . so if yours die , try waiting couple weeks	1
i love my sea monkeys so much ! they so cute ! but they very , very tiny . not sad if you not see them right away . they still there even though you can't see them . i began see them second day you too ! million bubble air pump very important because they die without air . this set comes everything you need ! i'm going feed them first time tomorrow i can't wait ! i hope you fun too !	1
i bought this after hearing how much my son ( then 6 monthos old ) loved stacking cups his ' school ' . he now turn 3 still enjoys them , his baby sister . it wonderful see how both them played these different times . you see little engineering minds nurtured they nest , stack - knock over towers ! i would love it just - but this also includes sorting shapes help them work problem solving too ! some cups wee shapes holes , which adds fun bath time . buckets would fun bath time anyway ( useful rinsing hair little bodies ) but it great them explore way water goes through holes some them . then we've got help learning count ... each inner cups/buckets number it , ( large bucket lid un-numbered #11 , but still stackable ) appropriate number * things * each ( stars , kitty face , etc . ) this set very durable - we've it over two years only handle bucket broke ( i stepped it ) but not big deal . one annoying thing handle bucket kept coming off . i stepped one cups also , it some white marks where plastic bent , but it still basically fine continues stack well . pieces well made enough , if you cups right order , they stack make very stable tall tower ... which just so much fun knock over . my son still loves these cups , my daughter really enjoys them too - she just learning joys knocking down towers . course my son other toys he plays , especially now he growing older , but i've heard people say they don't want ' waste ' money toys babies - this money would not wasted . it great developmentally - helping build variety skills understanding world - it one those great simple toys infinite number ways played .	1
what great chair ! i got it my daughter it just it says , pink snuggley chair ! sturdy very easy set up take down . loved furry cover ! would recomend minute free shipping too good pass up	1
i love this game i love it so cheap . only complaint i i didn't choice shipping , it took longer than i wanted ... i would paid extra but didn't even option	1
this game really fun , easy carry around especially good large groups . we played it christmas day it great	1
i one these sorters over year no problems . i use it without wrappers so there no jams . when i get home each night i just throw change my pockets there once week hit sort button . when i see full chamber i wrap coins put safe place until next time i go bank . its so easy use . i one each bedroom my house so everyone use it	1
primary purpose coin sorter put correct number coins into appropriate wrapper so you take it bank . that what i bought mine , anyway . this thing so imprecise you never really know how many coins wrapper . result , if you really want sure you count them . that huge drag sort defeats purpose owning this machine far i'm concerned . also , " overflow " reservoir where 25% coins end up whether tubes full or not . i previously owned coin sorter similar this one far its simplicity etc . but much more reliable . don't waste your pennies ultra sorter	-1
my daughter loves this toy plays it all time ~ we it over year now ! a++	1
overall game pretty good my 3 year old . graphics pretty good game fun . time , when he masters game , there no additional levels expand game .	1
my daughter loves this game , few others she , like care bears , winnie pooh , alphabet game , lion king older cartridge : little mermaid . she got it her birthday figured out how play them very quickly ! i'm impressed ! i think learning tool this great help her . she speach impairment it made learning fun her . i find it better than ps2 games my husband plays she taken liking . it more her age not just mindless games . it makes them think they learn all same time . it gives us something both sit down . learning tool i find it well worth money , well time put into it play it	1
this toy not good children just learning walk . back handle falls off constantly if pulled even slightly . mickey mouse ride-on/push toy much better choice ... my 12 month old son pushes it all over house loves all buttons	-1
i found this purchase reality what i expected it advertising photo . it reasonable size ( eggs 1 1/2 " long ) , likely stand up many years play	1
i bought these sale (...) it more than worth it . i would even say they worth more than . my sisters their kids my house ( 7 kids ) we all took turns making different recordings ( even adults ) we cracking up . i wish i would gotten extras christmas gifts	1
this product loads fun . my daughter loved hearing her own voice making sounds book . we never problem microphone , just pen when she decided chew through cord . no worries leap pad replaces them 5 dollars	1
we've purchased this doll my 3.5 years old daughter . she loves it goes sleep it . she presses ribbon when she under her blanket see glow ... truth me it just doll ( one too many ) , but she adores princesses , so her it real treat	1
this furniture made very nicely , very durable . it nice addition any little girl ' just moving ' , but i wouldn't buy it this site , because it extremely over priced , $49 bucks , you nuts ? you get this set any store $7.99 . it not like it collector item hard find , get real ! i would recommend getting this somewhere else , you get way more your dollar . other than price , set cute well made , but don't buy this seller , he over priced	1
this well made product . great design . good materials . no sharp edges . well worth money . my daughter loves it . it strong enough i sit it time time ( 150 lbs ) . easy assemble . we got it our daughter when she 1 1/2 years old put pillow under it so she could climb up it . she really loves it . lots smiles giggles	1
my 6 year-old son i tackled this project over series days . finished product truly work art , my opinion , looks better than any pictures . pros : outstanding detail , including working turbines engine you see above . feels solid when complete it rolls . ( most lego kits my son fall apart some point . not this one . ) cool flip up front turn steering wheel . cons ( these minor ): unfortunately , steering not turn actual wheels . no cool lego batman sit seat . instructions tough follow since almost 90% this kit black ! ( we few times where we redo past section because we installed it improperly . ) flames back very fragile fall off easily . quibble ... its original design doesn't look like any batmobiles you seen movies or tv . if you patience ( its 1,045 pieces , two instruction books 85 steps ) batman fan , this kit lot fun looks great when complete . well , lego !	1
my toddler enjoys this fisher price read me dvd very much ! she asks chicka chicka boom boom frequently . she learned match her capital small letters age two using this system . it easy operate -- she runs system herself . she watches story one time through , then goes right learning games every time	1
great educational toy . i 2 kids special needs this great way them learn read . i am hard time finding more dvd books system . found some here . hope they continue make them	1
i don't completely understand appeal this toy , but my son loved it moment his grandmother bought it him whim nearly two years ago . now , his younger sister cousin play it almost daily . one problem someone snapped off one doors shape-sorter part toy . also , " bed , " " chair , " other unidentifiable item go house part pretty goofy looking . kids would just happy without them . still , money well-spent	1
we visiting my inlaws europe they bought this toy our 20 month old daughter . out all toys we brought over she played this everday . we actually ship it back us . now she 3 my youngest 1 this still most popular toy house . it typical shape sorter hammer combo , but stairs where bear pops out cars big hit . i would recommend this toy anyone . very durable , washes it up great , still fun even after it over year . we bought many other chicco toys this still winner . i never written review amazon , but believe this deserves five star rating	1
we've this ball over 6 months our little one won't give it time day . i never seen her so disinterested toy before . i brought this because we several other manhattan baby products we just adore . this one huge disappointment . it much smaller than picture posted there no textures or anything really engage baby . it also odd because our ellie loves " taggies " but she not teeniest bit enticed many tags this . i would not recommend this product	-1
i agree everything madam pince review , but would just add they quite expensive add up really fast . my sons some plastic thomas trains they breaking batteries always fall out . wooden ones last forever , although paint chips off edges pretty fast . they so easy connect . my two year old knows how make sure they going right direction so magnets attract . i started small wooden train set toys us ended up becoming addicted thomas characters . now my sons probably 3 dozen wooden ones . if you want cheaper alternative , metal take thomas trains very nice quality also connect magnets . i think they actually look nicer , they more detail . they little smaller might just little more breakable ( some plastic parts ) . only possible downfall metal ones track . they only fit little plastic take track , which i don't like well wooden track , but more portable . anyway , if you don't mind paying twice much ( or more ) wooden ones last longest wooden track gives you many more options expanding creating new destinations . we spent hundreds these trains track , but my sons love them so much , i suppose it worth it . everyone always knows what get them birthdays christmas	1
james great job pulling coaches track . he pull pretty much anything fast pace . i've my jame sfor 9 years it looks almost new . he great engine you live episodes these trains	1
i bought these my 13 month old grandaughter . they make crinkly noise she loved them . she kept trying put baskets her head . it kept her entertained	1
this car extremely fast . steering car very responsive . kid love it , actually ordered one so kid race each other . battery only runs 20 minutes , order extra battery packs . this hobby grade car , not base version .	1
my seven year old got this track christmas . most challenging part putting it together getting loop ends hold together long enough snap loop connectors . i found tracks fit together well . remember use track joiners . if car jumps track , check see edges joined track smooth . tracks flexible so you bend them bit . make sure you wind cars until you hear loud clicking noise . this high quality toy , which it easier find	1
just gave this track our 3.5 year old son hanukkah . he very excited it minute we pulled it out box . tracks parts look very impressive . it took me , relatively intelligent 37 year old , 20 minutes put it together . once we it set up , it difficult get him away bath time . i definitely would recommend this toy kid who loves cars	1
this great learning tool kids learn skate . if you bad back it kills you trying hold kid up while they learn skate , but otherwise great learning tool . very sturdy love levels they give beginners already knowing how skate . little hard get feet out but i give it 4 stars	1
skates real hit my daughter . only negative i relate weight restriction skates should stated shoe size requirements . my daughter weighs more than 44 pounds listed , but i could not take them away her soon she opend box use them first time	1
like reviewer , sand bound up moving parts it largely frustrating my twin 2 year olds . boom release too hard my children release . bucket not pivot wrist-so it really not scopp up sand -- it just kind paws it . i suggest spending few more dollars getting better functioning toy your child	-1
i bought this my son 2nd birthday , since he construction truck fanatic . after reading other reviews , i prepared minor tweaking this toy required ( ie , taking apart locking mechanism , which very easy if you follow other reviewer advice ) . this definite must , my son frustrated immediately toy manufacturer made it . but after locking mechanism removed this toy incredible he plays it sandbox all time . it far his favorite toy held up wear tear sand pretty well . great buy one very cool toy	1
i bought tamagotchi amazon , it won't link up other tamagotchi , i bought 2 1 works 1 don't , can't see spending more money this piece trash get it fixed	-1
my son went nuts when he got these birthday gift . we would build up blocks he blast knocking them down . he loves playing these . fantastic gift item	1
i only wish there more blocks . my son who 3 enjoyed them continues enjoy them build build build . love these blocks	1
we purchased this toy our son last christmas . first all eight year old not able put this together . it might even difficult adult . when we finally finished it we put it it major problems . gears kept skipping . we called company see if there something we could they told us " well , really this toy not ment last " lot help they . so over all it giant waste money . it made it final resting place dump	-1
purchased radio flyer little red wagon my two year son christmas . we all love it ! it perfect all our needs . our son pulls his stuffed animals , toys , dirt , rocks around ease . i appreciate steering turning radius wagon , it enable our son maneuver wagon this own . we all know this very important two year olds ! mom dad love it haul child longer walks , we pick up pace get dome exercise . it also makes running errands around neighborhood great ! wagon large enough our son two bags groceries . we live rainy northwest occasion left wagon out side , no rust or water damage . there reason this wagon classic ! note : i would also purchase pad well .	1
this toy favorite . i love tune , it stuck our heads we all bob our heads quacks . my daughter also walks around house saying " wack wack wack " also it whenever she sees bird any kind . it really cracked us up ! red connectors get bent easily , so watch how you leave it box , but it fix itself easily too . ducks fall over lot beginning . she would actually get mad me when i righted them her . result our ducks no paint one side . but now she it herself manages pull them just fine . it very loud when we first got it but i think batteries dying i'm very sad i can't figure out how replace them . i used dread putting toys away because something would hit it it'd start quacking , amplified toy bucket , wake everyone up . sometimes string gets wrapped around wheel doesn't get pulled enough quack , but my daughter supply sound effects just fine . she loves push carts drag stuff behind her so i'm sure this last ... but i miss quacking !	1
i bought this 1-year olds birthday 7 years ago . my husband spent month before party , pulling string . he sad when i took it birthday girl . i looked high low one him . after 8 months , i again found it . he loves it . it such stress buster you simply gotta smile when you hear quack , quack , quack . when my aunt cousin ( both adults ) came visit , they too fell love it . unfortunately store i found it out again . this 3 years ago . i found it again today bought both store left . i plan get some additional ones hand . i truly believe every adult needs " feed " kid him/her . so , if you think this toy only children 10 months - 5 years , think again	1
this great little ones who like my little pony . pony walks says number different phrases . she good not getting stuck against walls , etc but she doesn't run very well carpet . my only complaint there no volume control since she runs best our hardwood floors sound quite loud .	1
i think this toy awesome !!! she sometimes gets bit confused where you want her go but overall she fun play . she really move her legs so amazed me but basically it because metal attraction . her talking cute but some times wierd . this pony my second most favorite toy	1
my 3 year old daughter got this doll chirstmas present . it not worked correctly since first day . i would not recommed this anyone . every time she tries use doll book i just get frustrated tell her just play pretend doll . doll it self very cute . it shame technology so poor	-1
my 2 1/2 year old daughter immensely enjoyed her dress-up trunk . she one four princesses loves parading around house her new clothes . heck , just one disney princess outfit usually costs over $20 , so this great buy . trunk itself flimsy cardboard , but it job . definitely must buy any budding princess	1

we got this our 1 1/2 yr old 3 yr old boys x-mas . i don't know who loves this car more , kids or my husband . my favorite feature abou this toy how remote control fits into car becomes part car when not use . my toddler loves carrying handle . we not experienced any operational problems mentioned several reviews . downside , this car little fast recommended age group . our house open floor plan so we not experiencing many crashes . i would not recommend this car if you tight living quarters . also , i would recommend keeping your pets out way when car use .	1
we bought this car our son 2nd birthday . he initially elated it really cute . after couple days he tired it but it still really cute durable great first remote control car . he found it really easy use no problem playing controls once we showed him how it works . he occasion plays it still . thank you	1

this toy such hit my son i still purchase it gift other toddlers . it amazing how much fun they it how long it holds their interest . this must	1
concept behind this toy great , but engineering/design not . looking picture here , i believe they may redesigned since we got our son one 6 months ago chute attaches differently pictured . perhaps this works better because chute constantly coming apart ours . we've also problem balls getting stuck or just kind swaying back forth . music horribly loud . we turn it off if we're trying watch tv son playing room . many musical toys least low high volume switch . this one desperately needs one !! positive , our son love watch balls grab them they pop out or go down chute . he chase balls when they go flying . he not quite old enough know how put them back toy once they out , but he'll get there . he'd probably play it lot more i more tolerance music	-1
kids love adding panels their creations . expands what you geomag sets . this also good starter set , but you'll want add more sets this one , sure	1

my daughter loves this thing .. she would sit watch ants hours if we let her ... we bought it teach her little bit responsibility so far its working . i'm glad we didn't just get regular ant farm , this one more entertaining	1
first , only one ant arrived alive . we sent off more total five living ants . these five great week then slowly starved death because they wouldn't come out sand tunnels . my seven year old so disappointed heart broken when he realized they all died . it really hard even see their tunnels because instructions say not move farm fear collapsing tunnels . now , we're waiting spring gather our own ants . guess what ? " sand " starting mold !!! total waste money , thanks uncle milton	-1
i ordered this my son 6th birthday . i knew experience we order ants wait spell good weather them arrive . here what worked me : i opened box when i got it sent ants right away . ( fyi : order tube ants , nothing else , it $3.95 . includes shipping . get ant farm club kit , which includes ants , food , magnifying glass , bunch other fun stuff , it costs $10.95 . includes shipping well . i decided splurge club kit ! ) ants arrived week after his birthday . he extremely excited get them ! while ants waited fridge ten minutes , i put sand/water combination ant farm . i put few drops sugar water then shook ants tube . while watching ants grow accustomed their new-found space , i decided i'd count . i think there 29 ants tube ( plus few spare body parts --- yuck ) . i counted 19 them living . few them died first day , but now i think we 13 live ants . that plenty small little space . i think i've more fun watching them than kids . it awesome see them grab sand move it elsewhere make tunnel . they're really fun ! i plan order more ants after these ones die . ( order form conveniently shipped ants . ) buy confidence ! this great gift	1

i same problem others . it only works upside down . it only works outside . it chugs inside . it works great disney store . when you get it home . it huge dissapointment	-1
first all , this product not work all -- if you read other reviews , you'll see it quite simply stutters seems run when held upside down . it supposed chase infrared beam . so there absolutely no excuse disney sell this . i am shocked appalled they so , my case it made exceedingly upset three-year-old this christmas . i suggest bootlegging much copyrighted disney material possible make up this outrage . i am kidding , but disney should clean up their act	-1

my son really enjoys his mater r/c towtruck . it even pulls his lightning car around house . my only complaint mater too fast , little slower or lower geared mater might better indoor use	1
my 5 year old son throughly enjoyed this recent addition his remote control collection - it extremely fast easy control . actually b/c it so fast takes moment stop we've ban certain areas house . i wish i gotten one my daughter she too loves mater when we're racing w/the other rc cars , we can't catch mater ! tow line ok , needs little sturdier i wish you could control it rc , it manual hook , little flimsy , but otherwise , i would purchase this any cars fan or children who like rc vechiles .	1
my son loves this dvd story . i think any read me products winner parent or child loves story time or reading time . i hardly believe they slashed prices or it didn't really sell much . i think society today should buy this type educational item more than video games kids ... my son cameron really loves this , parent , this great concept . all means you should own this item .	1

while this tv game cartoon-like graphics , it lot better than dvd game . it lot faster cases all lined up where you see which ones you haven't opened . you also start career mode where you keep track how much money you won total . it also bonus round end game where you win more money , even much $ 1,000,000 . game also features voice howie mandel all sounds music show . this definitely worth money , unlike incredibly slow dvd game . only bad thing game howie repeats same thing several times one game it starts get old . but considering how small controller/console/game , i'm just glad it voicework music it . definitely recommended anyone who loves show	1
grand daughter wanted drums .... she starting thesecomparable keyboard	1

this such cute picnic table boy or girl -you can't beat price too ! table top swivels so it becomes art desk which great artist family -if you one , which we ! not extremely easy put together , but it doesn't take genius or mechanic , either . also , don't plan seating four little ones , only two , but us , that great !	1
i use this game classroom math support teacher home my kids . all kids love it it moves good pace . i appreciate how game doesn't just let kids always decide what combination coins they'll use represent certain value . when they spin spinner , it sometimes land no dimes or no nickels , so . so they need figure out how make certain amount without those coins	1
we bought pair these handy easel paper pads pull them out rainy or snowy days . kids love using markers , crayons , foam stickers , glitter glue , whatever they get their hands , large 17x20 inch working space they create their masterpieces hours . this great price you afford buy one each kid everyone happy ! we didn't bother buying easel stand since our kids like spreading out floor space . stand up easel better used when painting	1
our 2 1/2 year old loves this product ! my only gripes so far jump sensor ( interactive games)requires constant readjustment , it takes up lot space ( not foldable ) , assembly instructions horrible ( took two people hour assemble ) . product itself sturdy most-used x-mas gift my son received this year	1
this different format than other shout games we played past . it even better than before ! we played teams enjoyed 2 full games without stopping . it brought back lots memories shows we all loved past	1
i played this game 20 adults 40th birthday party . we all great time . we divided into two groups : men vs women . great ice breaker people who don't know each other very well . we all something talk afterwards very informed . i bought rest shout games	1
i don't recommend this product . it gets locked up easily it hard 4 year old figure out how get it unjammed . my son got so annoyed it he doesn't even attempt play it anymore	-1
i thought this toy adorable . it great learning toy math , but it also fun dramatic play ! two toys one ! this toy also great practicing fine motor skills . all cookies big white number bottom , directly correlated number mm top . so , you count top mm or work number recognition using bottoms . my 18 month old daughter also still obssessed " put take . " so she spends lots time just doing this cookies . i one slight issue this toy - top cookie jar doesn't fit well i'd like . it never truly sits place correctly , although it sit top cookie jar . i'm not sure if this manufacturing problem or if it shipping problem . it looks like jar very slightly bent into oblong shape , which why i think top won't fit . this could simply shipping issue just me though . i've tried bending it back , but haven't any luck . either way , educational fun toy	1
h(oward ) p(hillips ) lovecraft wrote whole bunch short stories pulp magazines such " weird tales , " many which talked great cthulhu , supremely powerful force evil who laying dormant deep beneath pacific ocean , awaiting time when he would return power turn earth into waste land . lovecraft stories great old ones , cursed book called " necronomicon , " scholars miskatonic university , elder gods developed into what now commonly known cthulhu mythos ( term coined august derleth ) . other writers added cthulhu mythos , which continues expand this day , but heart it all cthulhu himself . so idea he turned into 8-inch plush toy takes concept cuteness damp , dark hole where it not seen light day countless years . cthulhu ( a.k.a. fisherman god , great old one , him who lies dreaming , him who rise again , etc . ) described lovecraft follows : " monster vaguely anthropoid outline , but octopuslike head whose face mass feelers , scaly , rubbery-looking body , prodigious claws hind fore feet , long , narrow wings behind . " addition " fearsome unnatural malignancy , " cthulhu described " somewhat bloated corpulence , " which certainly explains why it ended up plush toy , although i am not certain how accurate green part ends up . given literary heritage cthulhu , it amazing how much fun lovecraft greatest monstrous creation . there cthulhu president t-shirts , campus crusade cthulhu , marvelous on-line comic strip , " misadventures hello cthulhu " ( yes , think " hello kitty " unknowable evil walking around ) . i even seen cthulhu made out lego parts ( lego squid makes such things possible apparently ) . so cthulhu plush toy seems rather reasonable , one those brilliant examples how commercial impulse manifest itself diverse sections popular culture . plush toys nyarlathotep azathoth far behind ? stay tuned , boys girls .	1
classic fire truck -- large enough , some details , my boys feel like it real fire truck . i like fact it doesn't move its own -- you push it . sounds not too loud ( some may disagree , but i've heard louder ) . ladder hasn't broken yet , but it pretty thin plastic , so it probably break eventually . doors open put small characters .	1
he spends hours his day playing firetruck . it worth money . gives me couple hours sanity everyday !!! angie hac	1

i daughter going into kindergarten next year . my wife i bought her leappad two software modules it christmas last year thinking it would help her get bit head start before starting school . while my daughter doesn't play this her own , she likes using this software me or my wife . it seems like she introducing us characters she liked cars all things they this software . allowing her " show us around " , she learned quite bit this software . she seems fun it kid , fact she learning very satisfying me parent . i think leappad good job here	1
excellent toy interactive too !! reviewer gave it bad rating obviously bitter uninformed she obviously doesn't any hands experience this toy looking outlet vent out her frustrations	1
i read reviews " " sounding like " " . my son got this christmas gift pronunciation clear appropriate . perhaps they changed it newer ones	1
my 1 year old granddaughter got this bear christmas . it not worked right except day . after reading all reviews i am beginning think i just happened purchase bad one . course , she not age she use this toy herself . but we took it out box turned it her , voice startled her first , but she gotten used it . next day we turned it her it skipping pages . we took batteries out put new ones i turned it her today now it just keeps repeating page one . i older grandchildren very rough kept tj out their reach because i am afraid they break his arms . anyone else any problems this toy ? i am afraid buy any more books until i see if hasbro replace this bear one see if it works	-1
we bought this our daughter when she younger . it too frustrating . ants not made like they once it near impossible get them into pants . we would cheat her pretend they went after long while trying . even we could not get them . plus material so cheesy they break very easily . save your money buy better game instead	-1
i can't say enough these toys ! they so nicely made feel great your hands . small enough carry around big enough little hands . great quality , sturdy superior look . collectors buying these up like hot cakes ebay living proof people willing shell out cash these . especially ones harder find . people written reviews these no stores carry them . they sold out because there rush these toys even before movie release . hopefully time goes if they keep producing them they easier come . that what i am hoping . i don't all characters yet would like least one each my son , maybe even more collecting . good luck your search	1
where begin ??? this toy after setup , didn't last 15 minutes before breaking . ball return quit working literally after 15 minutes . ( my 2 6 year old very disappointed ) . " floor " bowling alley painted garbage bag -- how thin material . plastic tubes running sides only rest few plastic holders only place stickers/ velcro . nevertheless , these tubes constantly fell apart come undone . there 3 power wires running all over game . 1 scorer , 1 ball return , 1 pins --- ones pins ball return don't fit into their female receptacle properly ( they hang loose stick out 1/4 " . pins aren't pins . they aren't round , they cut half hollowed out . two bowling balls come this smaller than softballs plastic . i don't know what else say , i 1 , 2 , 6 , 8 year old thousands toys . this first one i said quality this toy complete garbage i must take time get internet figure out how leave review , because this toy wins award biggest piece garbage ever !!!!!	-1

we bought two - one 1 year old ( 15lbs ) 20 month old ( 35 lb ) . we also tried use it 4 month old ( 13 lb ) . only baby actually could use it 1 year old . 20 month old kept throwing himself out it ( he monkey anyhow ) ended up not wanting anything float . 4 month old just little too short could put her face water seat area . 1 year old absolute blast	1
we found this great toy . it actually works , unlike terrain twister . shell shocker durable , goes fast , spins around , opens closes its fins goes through just anything . it actually power . this fun toy . i dont think i would put it through mud or water though . i wouldnt want clean mud out it most rc type toys dont work well after getting them wet . we chase dog around yard it too , pretty fun . you need buy battery it cost $30.00 we've it 6 months love it , really cool toy	1
this bionicle visorak series stands among best ideas lego ever pursued . it clever , inventive , just plain fun ! i haven't kept up bionicle story over years . i always just liked action figures . bohrok very cool , rahkshi . i began lose interest bionicle when vahki came scene , but i still collected few them . far i tell , dynamic bionicle stories usually same . heroic , robotic toa versus horde monsters . that pretty much what going here . visorak cute four-legged monsters large pincers . there nine them here , they fighting against six elemental toa ( humanoid robots ) . it should noted toa figures not posable like other lego minifigs . they're more like mini figurines . each guy stands his own heroic pose , each guy carries his own unique silver weapon . there spears , halberds , battering rams . i'll forgive lack posability here because rest this set so cool . there six different visoraks ( they different styles pincers ) . this set comes nine them ( i get extra one mistake ? other sets come eight ) . three cute little monsters duplicates . they're made semi-flexible plastic . you push down monster back spring him into battle knock down robots . very cool . visorak also glow dark . both toa visorak figures some great textured detail , visorak some very nice color detail well . we also get larger visorak who i haven't seen before . he no pincers like his smaller buddies . just small tusks like elephant . like other visoraks , he four-legged monster . he constructed technic bionicle parts . pushing down his back raises his head reveal spring-loaded missile launcher sof t-t ip missile ( it also fires missile ) . colors dark blue , dark gray , he gold head piece . this guy isn't quite cool visorak queen battle metru nui set , but he appealing uniqueness . backdrop our frenzied melee monsters robots tall tower big black mask front gateway . above entrance tower grated window flipped open reveal spring-loaded missile launcher turntable . this one fires silver sof t-t ipped missile . launcher turn left right , raise lower aim , it also move back forth rails . high atop tower target our large visorak aim hopes knocking it over . tower also opening doors ground level , manually operated catapult launch flaming boulder . finishing touch some vines our little monsters use scale walls . little visoraks snapped firmly onto vine . going into construction tower mostly regular lego pieces , just few technic parts used catapult . colors primarily dark gray black . tower also ornamental blades silver spruce up look , toa mask , some torches , some really nice flame pyres , we get decorative decals opening doors mask gateway . this set lot tiny white horn/spikes . i found construction here easy enough . nothing too challenging . finished model sturdy easily portable . this set isn't quite action packed other bionicle visorak playsets , but it still visorak charm . added plus tower connected metru nui . i say , all sets this series great ! this kind thing i like most . lots guys cool weapons , lots cute little monsters , really nice techno-stronghold cool action features so i stage epic battle . my verdict : thumbs up	1
i got this my son he fun it , but i spent lot time trying unjam coins mechanism . actual coin sorter it stinks . number coins ( or even types coins ) end up each roll fairly inconsistent . also , it comes top keep little fingers out it , but there no way keep top , so my son got his finger caught rotating coin sorter once pretty scared until i could pry his finger out it . i wouldn't reccomend it	-1
easy install , side pieces attach low or high , i went high so pad would cover top wood sides when bent over providing more comfort passenger , see photos i left image area	1

okay , concept this game cube great , believe me : you spend many hours trying solve this puzzle . now reality ... i first tried this brain buster eighties when it came out . upon its first release , stickers stayed , plastic squares didn't break off , it just seemed like higher quality piece . i beleive plastic might heavier . but now , twenty years later , stickers peal off , squares pop out . junk , junk , junk ! if this made usa it would now cost more than it manufactured over seas , however ... it wouldn't junk . you get what you pay . stephen john becciaauthor treelanders	-1
they're stickers , stickers peel , get over it . what , ya expect paint job like car or something ? what next , pimp my cube ha ?!?! ( like reality tv show , pimp my ride) ?!?! i really like cutely packaged anniversary edition . makes very nice display . if you get anniv edition ya don't want ruin it , then i suggest ya keep anniv edition displayed shelf also buy 2nd cheaper version . no biggy	1
i recieved this shower gift before my son born . toys included great throughout his first year . we use toys beach toys now my son 2 . his favorite part alligator sprays water . i like toys all brightly colored instead usual light blue or pink most baby toys . only down side i found storage containers no drainage bottoms so you dry all toys before putting them away	1

i gave this my 10-month-old niece , she loves it . it really three toys one , so it hold baby interest long time	1
first all , price listed here amazon.com cheaper than toys'r'us or even wal-mart ... otherwise , i think it ridiculous pay more than ten bucks this toy . medium large cubes each opening one side , so you place small cube within medium cube , medium cube within large cube . they stick up out each other just enough little fingers pull them out , or you just dump them upside down . if you turn them upside-down , they become stackable . we got this our son when he four months old teach him hand-eye coordination ... he learned stack them before he could place them inside each other . ( my son kind kid who learned open our dogs ' kennel latches before he figured out how get rings his cone toy . ) he still plays cubes , he thirteen months old now . his favorite piece always small cube because it rattles inside . big cube mound " bananas " inside , medium one tree stump - both great exploring tiny fingertips . he likes putting some his other peek-a-blocks inside medium large cubes ... small cube works toys like peek-a-block goldfish . this toy also easy clean , which makes it great " sharing " toy playdates . it also nice way carry " three toys one " your diaper bag without taking up much space	1

we just purchased this game our 3 1/2 year old daughter she got pretty bored it after few rounds placing beans top pot . explaining how game works doesn't really matter - she just thinks if beans fall her side , she wins ! alone priceless . i like fact this game teaches her wait her turn when she playing someone only place one bean time - patience . i played this game kid , it seemed entire plastic pot holder so much thinner lighter than 30 years ago . i guess comes technology newer raw materials . scale 1 10 , i rate this toy 5 . it great toy if it around 30 years ! just keep things simple your little ones - they may not engage this toy more than 30 minutes , but it better than alot other games out there 3 year olds .	-1
other magic sets all too difficult my 8 year old son , so we tried this one mainly because it stated it " beginners " . my son loves it now working mastering his technique performance rather than spending time frustrated because he cannot tricks begin . i disagree others who felt some items flemsy . i feel all contents built well enough easy assemble use . instructions easy understand tricks fun watch .	1
this kit directions equipment ten magic tricks . some items made paper seem bit flimsy . i agree previous reviewer who said stacking boxes needed some reshaping . however , overall , this great kit . my son worked hard practicing practicing showing off his magic tricks . we one day few days running . it taught him work practice it helped him practice his speaking public ( since he performed everyone ! )he able complete most magic tricks little help after one demonstration . lots fun . enjoy .	1

my family i avid scrabble players looked forward trying new super scrabbble edition . we , however , sorely disappointed . only thing " super " it it super-long . while it great idea add more letters , higher points per word larger board , end product seemed inferior edition , hastily manufactured largely untested . manufacturer simply added border existing scrabble game board . new higher point squares all near periphery so it takes some game time able use them . board itself flimsy too large comfortably swivel each player takes their turn . it would better it turning pedestal similar deluxe edition . there many more tiles this board . it would nice tile pockets board hold them all place - again like deluxe edition . score pad too short length this game increased number tiles should larger bag same size bag makes it harder pass mix . we tried giving each player nine , instead standard seven , tiles but tile holder too short this comfortable . short , we not recommend this new version . it compares unfavorably deluxe scrabble edition	-1
family already loves scrabble super scrabble great addition ! gave it gift it received joy . it opened immediately game underway . great fun . higher scores	1

we " original " big wheel ( not really same original way ) it holding up fine but kids don't really like it much because wheel doesn't grip so it doesn't go fast . we bought this radio flyer my four year old he loves it . he figured out how twist it trike chopper back first day . he rides it everywhere . it last long , long time . it well built well balanced . it goes fast	1
we three boys -- ages 3 , 4 5 . this great toy because they all use it ( fact , they fight over it ) . we bought it 3 year old because it grow him . it hasn't gotten tons use yet b/c we're minnesota it christmas gift ( it not snow toy ! ) . it seems very sturdy rugged , twist unique high quality . i don't think we regret spending little extra it .	1
my 4 yr . old son obsessed his cars trucks especially cars movie . he constantly racing his growing collection cars trucks around house i began think he might enjoy track race them . my husband fond memories hot wheels track he when he boy suggested some friends family might make good gift him . he receive couple different hot wheels tracks , but they proved too complicated difficult my son set up run himself my husband afraid constantly buying batteries would prove quite expensive . after doing some research , i finally settled this cars lightning fast speedway track set . i knew it would only work his diecast cars cars movie not smaller hot wheels cars , but i figured it would good way introduce him using race track his cars we could worry getting track his hot wheels cars when he older . besides i knew he would love it , because he loves cars movie so much . i right . this definitely right track my son right now . it one piece which means there no complicated track pieces him figure out how assemble him scatter all over house . it also folds up which makes it easy store move around . on/off switch bit stiff but he it himself . he also place cars start ramp himself he loves watch them race around track . he also loves when crash middle . track works best 2 cars time , but it also works reasonably well 3 or 4 cars time long batteries fresh . only thing doesn't seem work advertised hand pedal increase or decrease speed . it doesn't seem really anything all when he pushes it down or pulls it up , but my son doesn't seem care this all . he just likes watch cars race crash . not all cars diecast vehicles work this track . ones designed race cars work great - lightning , chick , king , doc etc . some cars aren't race cars but similar shape also work fairly well - sally , sheriff etc . - though they sometimes get little hung up their way around track slow things down or crash . other characters such mater , filmore , ramone , luigi , guido , red etc . don't work all . however , doesn't seem bother my son much . he just turns motor off races them around track hand . he races his hot wheels tonka town trucks around track hand well . overall , i'm very happy this purchase i believe my son too . he played it every day since he received it over week ago , i haven't replace batteries yet - though i think they slowing down bit now . i definitely reccommend this track set any child 3-5 yrs old who not ready traditional hot wheels track who loves cars movie cars	1

my son loves this toy . it bright , durable , it plays lots songs it easy batteries ( our first set toy came lasted almost whole year frequent use ) . one key moves elmo head back forth , one key spins dorothy ( fish ) around her bowl , other keys move whistle-shaped figures up down . song book flips three different levels fun . only complaint i key spins dorothy also key moves elmo head too stiff baby or even younger toddler push himself . ~ sta	1
neca continues get very cool licenses their movie figures , continued where mcfarlane started . fact i prefer their figures mcfarlane ones . however they some problems . sometimes their figures won't stand up . such this one . only way get him stand lean him up against wall . design this figure his feet positioned weird angle . fact whole stance figure looks off . pushing button back figure play freddy jump rope song . yes , thats cool , but it pain activate due fact you lean this figure against wall . it also comes optional demon head , which you replace freddy head . honestly , if you want large freddy figure display , track down older mcfarlane one . you pay lot more , but it lot better sculpt than this one it based better nightmare film ( nightmare part 1 ) . or just buy 7 " figure neca recently re-released	-1

( if you've gone through conflict mommy-my-toy's-arm-broke-off ) if your child loves build things , remarkable immagination , likes various colorful action heroes , ( my apologies those going through power rangers phase ) bionicle toa toa nuva worthy title , " must-have " . educational well , your child learn few basics simple machines motors well . thank you reading my review , i just hope my mother reads it	1
we leappad plus writing couple years now . when it works it great my kids love it . durabily awful ! we now our 5th or 6th pen it . this must problem most them since last time i called company they autimatically stated one phone options you get up 2 free pens it ( cost $5 s/h each pen -another $10 bucks down drain when it actually only costs them probably $1 ship mail . ) pen so sensitive sometimes it seems work ok then others like bones body- you touch bone it give you wrong answer . books lot fun educational but we paid $80 this when it first came out we own probably 7 book ($15 average per book)and if leap pad isn't working books waste ) . last time i used this my son it started off working fine then all sudden pen wouldn't recognize anything . i called co . they told me they would give me 1/2 off new leap pad plus writing book . i thought kind stupid considering i already one obviously isn't working wouldn't spend money getting new one same problems . they suggest when problems pen clean prongs alcohol - this never worked me . it might okay buy if pen wasn't attached book because it seems every little tug you need new pen . i am debating getting new leapster l-max , but am worried it also problems . very disappointed leappad plus writing	-1

if you planning serve your eager children half cup chilled but still liquid halfhalf sugar seaweed it but thought making them wait half hour first would increase enjoyment , fine . but don't bother buying this item because assembly , clean up expense waste your time money . two cautions : because it child oriented activity it not those who use occasional swear word everyone should wear safety goggles case you decide smash device into even more pieces . this review based several trials . thanks refill packs , gift giver	-1

this toy really rude ! it says " outta way " other very rude phrases . i can't believe anyone would produce toy like this think it okay . this toy got home bottom garbage	-1
i wish i seen these reviews before buying this obnoxious toy my 10 month old christmas . i agree what other reviewers saying ; this toy barks rude orders like " outta way ! " demands you " fill ' er up !! " extremely snotty voice . it sing couple traditional tunes , such alphabet song , but even singing voice attitude . so unless you want your little guy or gal learn poor driving manners , steer clear this toy ( no pun intended) !	-1
this my fourth lego star wars set , i must say , i enjoyed it very much . not only it fascinating piece together , but i even fun playing it after it assembled . i started x-wing . intricate set gears rubberbands work mechanism slowly opens closes wing formation . it so interesting watch pile plastic come together into working , simple machine . i find it bit repetative assemble all four parts wings , however . details ship include variety appropriate colors textures . i pleased final look . however , anyone wishing any excessive play this toy should expect some less secure pieces pop off occasionally . i then moved yoda hut . this my favorite toy set . it opens closes , either formation looks like appropriate home yoda . it includes little fire pot , mug pitcher , barrel , even small bed . my favorite thing hut bed top swings away reveal yoda hidden light saber . even yoda himself highly detailed head appropriate shortened body . i pieced together hut , i issues pieces falling off , but completely finished model perfectly stable . this set very enjoyable put together . it variety moving parts play . details pieces make it seem right out star wars universe . it perfect lego set either display or playtime .	1

i love this stuff ! it really fun just hold your hands while you watch tv or ride car . my children ( 7 4yrs . old ) also enjoy it . it bunch tiny styrofoam balls stick each other feel sticky but your hands perfectly clean comfortable once you put foam down . not appropriate toddlers who put everything their mouth	1

this set composed five main sub assemblies dragon , should take 4 hours ( or more ) complete . it comes six mini-figures number operational catapults , inner keep , main gate . lego integration technic parts never better than last few years , like all their recent sets , number one feeling one gets one extreme cleverness . ( one point building this set i said aloud " this exactly what vikings would if they technic parts back then . " ) concerns rest this series , ship similarly awe inspiring boat , catapult , wolf sets make excellent additions battlefield . only thing one could wish enemy series pit vikings against . though all mythical creatures well designed look impressive , it would nice array viking sets ( boats especially ) against competing force , none current sets good match	1
this great version game . we got this our 11 year old son it fun play . it easier than regular edition ( no surprise ) . really nice thing it multiple choice -- each question three options choose . instructions simple questions good , wide range interests . definitely recommended children families	1
display only stayed bright enough read clearly 3 weeks . i turn sound off so writing would " appear " . otherwise , it wonderful ! second set batteries already going out now . i recommend playing without sound so they last longer	1

i got bear wand my son . bear button it hand , each time you press it , you get different light show . colors fade out change . bear turn off after 15 mintues , so it great kid take bed night . i wish bear more uniform lighting , you could stop light show so it would just glow one solid color . way lights positioned inside bear , when it , his cheeks , hands , feet tummy glow . i think it bit over priced what it	1
my 3 year old daughter loves this bear . bear so soft light show controlled child , even small child . it greatto play before going sleep	1
we bought this our 7 months old she not like it all . there really nothing amuse her . we placed some toy it , but still nothing her . if you looking somewhere place your child listen them scream boredom ... then here your two stars . far bouncing , this not good idea . there really no support walls this item . bouncing 18-20 pounder not good idea . bouncer never sat straight , it always tilt it . maybe packaging . also , toy hung wrong overhead well . we now 4 months later ( not much use ) throwing it out !!! somewhere , it sprung leak we cannot seem find it either . so , overall ... this not one our better choices	-1
this worst children game i've ever seen -- bar none . i am few months away completing phd i can't understand/remember confusing directions ... you imagine how frustrating it my 4 year-old her friends ? game so complicated so devoid fun we never finished it , whenever we play it , everyone ends up unhappy . ditto what everyone writes cheapness construction pain-in-the-butt set-up . i hope disney pulls this market -- it so awful i am not even going give it goodwill , i'm just going trash it	-1
my daughter likes it , but only because she unusually high level patience . her friends refuse play it after they tried unsuccesfullly finish game . 30 minutes into it they nowhere near even middle game set friends who quiet calm . i would never pull this game out some her other more rambunctious friends . please not this game	-1
my daughter got this toy when she 6 months old . time she could pull out shapes , bounce birdies push big counting button . now she 16 months old match shapes into correct spots still enjoyings bouncing birds counting pond . great toy !! one few she enjoyed nearly year ! rare ! not worth paying $60 here though ... go bru or walmart	1
both my handicapped 8 year old son my 15 month old absolutely love this toy !! it taught my 15 month old sort now he uses his block box sorting instead throwing !! even older kids i take care enjoy playing this toy . music warm nature sounds very clear . only problem i tips sorting blocks break when stepped ... * lol * other than this wonderful addition our toy collection !	1
i toddler who very picky toys , i hard-pressed find one keeps his attention . he received this little tool set christmas loves it . he into more mechanically oriented toys , naturally , so it up his alley . but set well-crafted easy him use . drill actually drills screws interchangeable bits . our little guy pretends he bob builder yellow hard-hat . i can't vouch longevity this toy , since we've only it month or so , but it neat little tool-set held up lot abuse so far	1

i've playing kismet my friend house since childhood , what great game ! they recently taught me easy way spice up game ... add strategy required win ! here it : each game sheet columns six games . instead playing one game time , you play 3x or 6x . obviously , each longer time commitment other . say you're playing kismet 3x - you play three games all once . when you're finished , game 1 column score remains ( 1 ); multiply game 2 column score 2 ( x2 ); multiply game 3 column score 3 ( x3 ) . then , add those three totals together - this your final score ( could range 1500 - 3000 points or so ) . key here choosing which column input your different rolls . obviously , good rolls w/ high scores should fill up your game 3 column , b/c it going end up multiplied 3 . you want put your poor rolls game 1 column . try it , it fun !	1
my sister i played this game every night two months . it almost exactly like game yhatzee , but it colors thrown . there list sets get like : three kind , all same color , two pair . after you roll , you pick which dice you want roll again . you roll total 3 times see if you get any sets . it so fun because it so basic . not lot rules remember . we usually play 3 games night . also good travel since you really only need dice score cards ( maybe rolling cup ) . not good play when your parents trying sleep though ! dice really loud when rolling them cup . really fun game	1
i bought this my nephew christmas it one those toys he opened right away end night there dominoe trains all over kitchen . he kept us entertained	1
fun toy kids 4 up but wish it come few spare parts . some dominoes clip special way if you lose those , it no longer all it supposed . but it works better than you would think still used even when piece or two disappears	1
these cars so much fun ! just name says , you just shake it up it goes . my son several these they all slightly different reactions . some faster than others . they work best hard surface - cement , hardwood floors , tile . they go pretty slow carpet . cars very durable . one my son favorite games launch them off deck see if he get it land grass below . if weather isn't nice , he likes send them racing down stairs . so far , nothing broken its over six months . these cars easy my daughter ( who only two ) play too . kids love shaking cars racing see who car goes farthest .	1
i agree first review , it tough open . my daughter puts all her hair ties things like inside , so when we're getting ready school , it pain get open . music adorable , design itself well . necklace comes it , course cheap fell apart quickly . overall , if your daughter loves cinderella , she love this toy	1
car fun toy our 22 month old . she little trouble steering it but she getting hang it . it moves just fine our berber carpet also works fine outside- even grass . overall it great little car perfect young toddlers because it doesn't go too fast very simple operate . cons : back tires spin zero traction . also , stickers already peeling off it 3 weeks old	1
this game two four players , more better . there not too many games you play six players . this keeps all ages interested , even my seven year old . we thought he too young , but he won ! he seemed think most money way go , not buying much it . it total pokerface , he bluffing whole time making us think he really didn't get game he felt most money would win , but he ended up tricking us winning . we all stunned . we so much fun we actually continued game whoever left game . even parent it challenging play against kids . some games you sake interaction your kids , but this one hold your interest	1

i really wanted like this game , but there serious problems version comes blue box . 1 . pegs fall out vertical board . this serious game play issue because you cannot tell where you fired or scanned . 2 . voice very difficult understand . i cannot emphasize this enough ... not buy version blue box . it stinks . i able contact hasbro ( not easy feat because their phone line constantly busy , you wait hold ten minutes their operators hung up me twice [ accidentally i hope ] before i got speak them ) , they sent me entirely new unit green box . buy version green box ; it great ( just don't use it elevated mode ; keep it flat table )	-1
this dvd contains six rounds . questions same everytime you play round . so once you've played one rounds , you know all answers . price , sux . i expected different random questions every game , not so . i bought this game because it packaged like it rock based game . ( guy les paul guitar front box , lollapalooza sample question back , it comes hard rock cafe poster which box game their logo all over it ) so i bite . then game questions country artist clay aiken rapper 50 cents . what up ? plus game main theme music c+c music factory " gonna make you sweat " . it still rather enjoyable , except dvd kept freezing up . so overall , avoid it unless you find it five bucks or less !!	-1
we hadn't played any new dvd games until this past weekend . one party we played shout movies riff . we hated shout ( i am posting our review ! ) we loved riff . riff completely dvd . you play teams use dvd remote . best part battle bands questions which went people screaming laughing . high or lower fact or wack parts game most original stuff we seen . loved this . then there music videos , picture questions , music . what really great how much stuff current music this game . how much stuff we managed actually remember . there other stuff too . look inside hard rock collection very cool . so poster included . but star game . we went out bought our own copy next day . we can't wait play it again ( this weekend . ) riff amazing !!!	1

this renditionof hot rod ( also known rodimus ) one gems transformers : classics toyline . this toy suprisingly solid both forms attention detail quality impressive . his car mode looks most like his g1 cartoon/movie version than any other classics transformers except perhaps starscream . i especially like way his gun turns into jet engine ( like one batmobile ) rear car car mode . one worst things original transformers keeping track their accessories , but this latest line toys weapons usually integrated into vehicle mode somehow . this one best examples integration . only thing i could really find nitpick this toy lack autobot symbol hood , but isn't nearly enough keep me giving this toy 5 stars its great transformation , solid feel amazing poseability ( especially compared original	1
rodimus homage generation 1 autobot hot rod , who later became rodimus prime transformers animated movie 1986 . transformation bit tricky , few connections finagled back forth before they become lose . one careful when putting feet position , it not readily obvious it stabilizers within main part feet flip out behind robot . once correctly , rodimus stands quite nicely stablely . gun shoot it missle , but not more than 18 inch range . all all , nice solid toy .	1
this such cute little box , but , most importantly , chocolates great ! they kinda squishy melty , they taste like they're custard-filled . why spend your money something see or sweet factory when you just buy this ? besides , it educational . when you chew chocolate it gets all mushy ... that what i call " cause effect ! " my only complaint it smells little poopy . this product you must buy !!!	1

im not understanding how so many parents outraged songs tape . " stacy mom " song sunny delight commercials pete sake ! when i hear it , i picture boy innocent crush stacy mom . im not over thinking it neither kids . kid thinks " stacy mom got it going " so what ?? what you people thinking ? outkast " hey ya " song .... song virtually everywhere , its even few kids bop cd . you really think child knows what meant " dont wanna meet your momm-a , just wanna make you cumm-a ? kids know what word means ? no , my children certainly dont ! so why worry ?? i think parents definitely over think project their adult knowledge into child . children think simply , they arent worldly or knowledgeable such things . " dont want meet your daddy , i just want you my caddy " ... i doubt kids age even know what caddy never mind why he wants her back it ! when i kid i singing " push it " salt pepa . i no idea what they talking but i liked song . course now i know what song am shocked i sang it 9-10 years age but song way more sexuallity it . maybe i just raised different generation or maybe i just let kids kids sing songs all over our countries airwaves anyway . censor censor censor .... kids exposed it anyway , might well relax put letter writing campaign rest . really , its not bad people	1

i purchased bubba bottom feeder game after reading instructions back box . i grew up playing all kinds cheap pool games my grandma pool , most them some type ring toss game , or you dive certain items scattered across bottom while your siblings desperately try stop you getting last one . bubba bottom feeder bit different- it set up like -reverse- dive game . " bubba " big fish big green weighted lips who sinks bottom pool . ( his lips also hinged , making nice carrying case other parts game ! ) his body made mesh net , probably safety reasons- so everything dry quickly when game over . game also comes several adorable little round plastic fish , each one weighted slightly different size ping pong ball . most float surface , while some sink slightly below . object then gather these little fish , one time , " feed " them bubba , resting bottom . each fish he fed causes him get little lighter -- until finally he eats " too much " floats surface , game start again . person feed him fish makes him float- wins . ( i think . ) it no means hours fun , but it nice spin dive games , concept feeding big fish well thought out ( it would much less fun putting ping pong balls underwater net , example)the construction pretty good inexpensive pool game well- i only worry bubba hinged lips breaking where plastic gets fairly thin . overall though this great little summer pool toy price , nice sense humor ( maybe teaches kids not overfeed pet fish ? ) quite fun kids	1

while this newer editions look almost exactly same , i assure you they not . aside playing them , which fun they what else you dominoes general ( build small house or so ) , dominoes you'll get not originals . original version " item 707 " written bottom weighs more than 2lbs its lunchbox very noticeably heavier than its newer counterpar t.t he new version " item 00707 " written bottom weighs around 1lb . what this mean ? well , original version dominoes made dense ivory or bone ( i don't know much them , but they thick ceramic-like dominoes ) . newer ones hollow plastic feel cheap - you crack them if you apply fair amount pressure or accidentally step them . original , however , you toss through car window hurt someone . so before you order , ask merchant specifically what bottom pale says ; they won't know real difference , but if it doesn't say " item 707 , " you're not getting your money worth ( they cost same , original may discontinued ) . fyi , i ordered my original stuff kids like newer one entertainment earth ( both directly their respective website , not through amazon )	1

kitchen set one more expensive loving family room sets buy , which attributed light sounds . central oven display button when pushed makes sounds coffee brewing , water running , food cooking range , oven timer beeping , phone ringing . however , sounds little loud it bit hard distinguish coffee , water , cooking sounds . set comes its own battery easy change standard aa size . dishwasher rack ' slid ' out when dishwasher door opened . we've found it pretty tricky get it move much all . coffee pot cooking pot attached countertop short tether . oven door opens oven light goes when it opened . oven timer also beeps whenever oven door opens . muffins/muffin pan comes set fits either top or bottom rack oven . there also phone tether snaps into hanging cradle . my daughters ( 3 1/2 2 ) no problem getting phone off cradle but don't dexterity getting it back ye t.t he refrigerator sliding vegetable bins , room putting food shelves , both refrigerator freezer compartment . our girls like taking included pizza out freezer baking it oven . there also purple rug , some food refrigerator ( one molded piece ) , double high chair twins complete spoon ( tether ) bib each . bibs relatively easy little fingers place around babies necks , but it little tricky get babies into high chairs . it takes some maneuvering adjusting babies legs . one my favorite tie-ins twin time dollhouse bonus set includes " wet bar " high-back chairs , towel , tray cocoa cookies match kitchen set . this starts make room look like real kitchen when you add counter chairs eat . there isn't lot room get combined pieces all into one space , but it fits decently extra fold-down floor space bottom central room twin time dollhouse ( if you don't mind chairs carpet ) . even though this one more expensive sets , there little hesitation our buying it . first , what house without kitchen ? second , my girls loved playing set even package store where they pressed button repeatedly ( you always take out battery , right ? ) . finally , set perfect balance detail simplicity ( just like other room sets ) keep my girls interested playing it again again	1
it big , apparently tough outdoor play , but nearly 3 year old , very limited what it . even adult , i found crane mechanism difficult manipulate hook system impractical use anything . ours came bunch heavy paper construction blocks you put together , intended use crane hook , but they don't fit it , so they're useless . plastic tabs some them insert hook rail , but even isn't very functional . crane winding knob too difficult small child also . only 3 big tonkas available now kids play outside , this big disappointment set . only mighty dump truck really good toy kids , even loader little going it . crane definitely worst , though . not tonkas my youth , that sure	-1
my 3 yr old son likes this only because its big wheels because he put stuff ( other toys small cars ) into bed . like other reviewers said , crane doesn't work very well piece supposed hold cars or whatever you pick up comes off very easily . he basically using it like dump truck ... he wanted crane though	-1

i'm not impressed quality this marble set because blocks which curved tunnel carved roughly there only one way set them up so marble doesn't just stop tunnel . if inside tunnel smooth more carefully designed , marbles would roll like they should . when i kid , i fantastic wooden marble run set , but nothing market seems equivalent . most sets holes lengthy pieces marbles drop through . i think without holes there more possibilites set up . however , my four year old enjoy this set . i play her shown her how change set up when marble stops .	-1

i am very impressed this game . it my birthday present . i really love little clones droids . it perfect star wars fan . i hope my review helped you	1
i loved star wars risk since i kid combination two awesome . star wars risk very different traditional risk . example : you can't back stab your partner take whole world -- er -- galaxy yourself but keeping star wars : light side good dark side bad . game play very ballanced ( despite initial appearances ) but some traditional risk strategies may not work so well . first all light side must act quickly capture many sepratist leaders ( new rules ) possible instead trying take whole galaxy force . need haste comes power darkside declare executive order 66 ( more new rlues ) thus turning whole lightside worlds troops dark side . i seen complaints unbalanced rules eo66 powerful tool evil but light side win ; it just requires speed some new strategies . when i play variant game i want game similar but different than its parent game i think this nearly perfect risk variant . very different but great .	1

this versionof optimus prime supposed look more like cartoon optimus than original toy . well far hasbro intention , i can't say they very successful . what they , however , create very affordable very sturdy new optimus prime toy more common original cartoon than more recent incarnations prime . toy very solid , feels like something you could play , unlike recent titanium series 2oth anniversary prime . transformation very solid not difficult pull off , posability robot pretty much top notch . my only gripes design truck mode ( headlights look weird ) , no trailer , smokestacks/gun . it cool incorporate gun into truck mode , however gun doesn't resemble primes gun all , flat square smokestaks just look bad . also doors truck attached prime forearms , which just kind strange , but it doesn't look bad ( just strange way go , when they say they trying make toy look more like original cartoon ) . there gun made wind deflector top truck , but it also doesn't look like primes gun , long enough look silly robots hands	1

this basically replica great low price . these things last , i promise you , they look much better then electronic lightsabers . these " basic " lightsabers : retract into handle . lock place so it only opens when you press activation switch . clip your belt , pocket , pants , ect . ease . basic better . trust me . may force you	1

if you loved classic game operation you simpson fan , what could better ? homer operation game . his comments make you laugh . great game any age	1
i shoulda gotten something else . my son i used this entire summer , it never much fun . it smaller lighter than we would've liked . if it easier hold , weighes bit more , then when we aim throw thing into water , it should glide down least few seconds before slowly coming back up . it , it pops right up very close us no matter how hard or light we throw it , it doesn't matter angle descent , it so light it surfaces almost immediately	1

this given gift my 2 year old little girl . it very cute ! it doesn't take up much room you always fold it up tuck it away somewhere if need . only negative thing i say there little plastic pocket door , it ripped off very easily . i think it there so you could personalize boutique your childs name , not sure though . there cardboard insert window it becomes bent very easily . but price it very cute my little girl lots fun it .	1
you regret this purchase . unless , course , you not mind re-adjusting poles pulling it upright your child every 3 minutes ! however , if your child continually sit still inside never touch teepee itself , then this toy you ! my opinion , this item complete waste money . poles not stay place properly when children move inside . i constantly fix it so it would stand upright kids . not all durable . it up less than week when pole broke . material also ripped easily . wasn't even worth giving goodwill . it now takes up space some landfill . thought it would cute my little boy cowboy themed room . too bad , what waste	-1

... story activity wise , this great book my pre-schooler enjoyed . it features all characters show fits well concept underlying bear big blue house . reason i don't give it five stars because pages kinda thin age group whom book directed , so we really careful when giving it our four-year-old . given age group which it directed , i think this would better off my first leappad book rather than leappad book . but it great book younger kids enjoy	1

my daughter loves these speakers . they compact sound quite good . i gave these 4 rather than 5 because adapter nano not hold ipod securely other speaker systems i've seen . i'm concerned unless my daughter particularly careful when putting ipod or removing it dock , connector could bend or break . otherwise , this great little system	1
we went new year eve party adults some some teenage children found this great way include everyone - younger people could answer shows us older folks not even heard . our hosts gotten three cd set christmas one their grown children . it great fun - we all highly recommend it ! only downside those us who played it cannot play again .	1
i got this game , heard little it decided some friends over play it , all without trying it out first . we ended up loving it . everyone totally involved questions , which range easy obscure , making it much , much better than scene it , which takes too long too easy . we all shouting out movie titles , left right , great time . it section called still crazy , which takes still movies starts out background , then drops diff't parts , hats , chairs , until faces dropped , all while you guess what movie . it blast , very creative . it good game whether you film buff or just someone who wants go movies . so , if you're bunch people over holidays , this game get . all you need dvd player , remote tv , some friends play . you great time .	1
this not what i expected all , its granules silicone type stuff which makes most unbelievable mess . however , kids however loved it ! ( they've never seen real stuff . ) i got fed up cleaning them off my kitchen surfaces hid it cupboard end . save it summer yard or deck ! yuck !	-1
we played this friends it outstanding . it fun all ages . we played all adults it awesome , we all get dumbfounded we didn't get what we doing each others animals right away . so it fun make fun each other congrats each other also . if you better memory than your friends than this game you play them ... you win . kids it similar game memory great them build thought process ..	1
this game awesome ! we play it all time whenever our girls griends come over , they want play too ! you remember who what animal barn front them when you flip cards match , you guess what other person barn . first person guess gets give all their cards discard stack other person , goal get rid all your cards . really fun , great memory too	1
i love cabbage patch babies . i ordered this baby advertised page , thinking it would look just same . it red hair , but not purple outfit different hair style . my daughter personally picked this one out different one sent . i didn't know they send whatever may look similar . baby cute anyway - outfit probably not one i would picked if i saw it store .	1
i bought this my 27 month old son ( i know , he " too young " , blah , blah , blah ) we both love it . i no issues building it actually found no issues instructions either , maybe i'm smarter than average bear ??? my instructions tell me two power switches located annie , so maybe there two versions instruction sheets out there . my son loves it so far it functions stated . steam sounds very cool my wife looks kid me totally facinated . i only it week , but so far , if anything , steam thickened . only complaint i this point this thomas not detach second coach car ( annie ) , since annie car powers thomas forward provides power steam sounds . also , this thomas much faster than only other tomy engine we , so either duck slower than most or thomas faster than most . i wish they could made them all go least close same speed . this thomas catches up duck less than two circles around track . oh well , it still very fun cool .	1
my son who recently turned 3 years old loves this toy . my sister just gave it him birthday present yesterday . instructions not very clear . it took me some time figure out how make thomas work properly . it requires3 aa batteries , one bottom annie two top ( you need remove upper part insert batteries ) . this ok instructions , no problems all . after placing batteries , filling water tank thomas water , my son so frustrated see there no red light funnel it not making any sound , nor puffing steam . i thought it just matter waiting few minutes , but nothing happened . i noticed all water filled inside thomas came off bottom , i thought problem , but i think this supposed happen there place water stored left water tower , so i guess excess water really needs come out ( if you don`t want your floor wet , sure assist your child towel handy remove excess water stored bottom water tower everytime your child fills thomas water , or they may make it fall floor ) . after many attempts make thomas puff steam , i decided search internet instructions how use this toy i found manual line where i saw there on/off switch button bottom annie . i took my son`s train noticed this bottom off position , then i switched it position , placed thomas tracks , but then again , nothing happened . then i decided replace batteries new charged ones , voil� ! it began make sounds puff steam . instruction manual came toy doesn`t show this button picture or mention it anywhere . so if you purchased this toy it`s not working or if you going purchase it , check if this other button bottom switched , if it still not work , put new batteries ( requries 3 aa batteries ) . i think these tricks . you also need show your child how use it beginning . it important not fill funnel where steam comes out water ( i think children may want try put water there ) , there small whole thomas where water must poured into , but after i showed my son how use it , he learned it without problems . my son playing it all day it`s working very well . i only give 4 stars because instructions poor , but toy nice one works well . my son huge thomas tank fan , he lots trains hundreds tracks he really loves this steam train . if you looking present child , also consider buying wooden trains . my son loves these plastic trains , but he also loves wooden ones . they more expensive , but very nice children he seems interact more wooden trains . there also die cast trains , less expensive than wooden ones , but my son says he prefers wooden ones than diecast versions . he says steam thomas wooden ones his favorite . anyway , it varies child child . this what my son says he likes . :o )hope my review helpful	1
i love this toy so much . i got dalmation one christmas he so cute . he really what i tell him . well , sometimes he gets confused . like , sometimes he shakes even when i don't tell him . but i don't care . he howl . he shake . he'll play drop it . he beg little . he lay down . he sit up . i think this great toy all dog lovers	1
just others said their reviews , this not toy kids under 2 . i bit concerned spending $250+ toy where many reviewers not satisfied . but we promised this my daughter if she succeeded toilet training ( which she ) . she 2 3/4 yrs old , i thought she might too big based recommended age . " button " makes train go hard hold down , everyone said . it not like doorbell you would push . it more like bar you need squeeze , fingers top , thumb underneath . my daughter no problem it , but i would think any child under 2 1/2 would . she not too big it , i see her riding it while come . i would say recommended age should 2 1/2 - 4 . train seems stable , no tipping issues . only complaint they recommend charge battery after every use , which requires removal panel screwdriver . overall lots fun , but more attention should paid design . i would buy it again recommend it friend	1
other reviewer correct her assessment . this attractive doll . her hair great . she very angely if i may make up adjective . she beautifully packaged i collect barbies so i not taken her packaging , but i peaked her feet . i wanted see what they put her feet . i hoping she'd slippers or sandals . doll actually barefoot , which fine , but she not any toes ( no lines mark toes ) what i see . this my first collectible without shoes , so i don't know if that common or not . i've given her 4 because lack shoes my collection she falls middle . she great pink label though .	1
works just like description says . nemo other hand sank after first day	1

i'm parent 4 yr old 2 yr old , i inspired write this because few negative reviews i read here . any product few bad apples , which why we customer service departments , but i never experienced malfunctioning or poorly constructed geotrax element over 2 yrs buying stuff . my son club which regularly exchanges geotrax elements all other parents rave geotrax well . stuff takes beating kids this age , hard plastic geotrax stood up test flying colors . you get both electric trains non-electric trains/vehicles geotrax . you definitely should get rechargeable batteries ( aaa ) electric trains , since like any other small toy electric motor , trains run out power . but i'm amazed how long they last one charge . red fire rescue electric train extremely popular somewhat rare , which why amazon always sold out . you watch all time , but you find it . most geotrax elements very popular hard find , so you little homework . amazon best place find them , however , we've purchased least half dozen pieces them . overall , people who complain geotrax either rare lemon , or they never used product . this exceptionally well-designed , well-manufactured product any child love . you love it because it last years	1

my 8yo dd got this her grandma . she wanted it so bad . she loved it when she got , it so soft squishy , so cute . she used it first few mornings , but says she doesn't want use it anymore because it scares her when it barks . i'm sure this just personality quirk . we've tried putting it different places room so it not loud , which it not really loud anyway , but doesn't make difference . we also time setting alarm properly . there two on/off switches dogs legs don't seem go into right position every time it set , so i never know sure alarm go off . this our experience	1
my daughter loves her new alarm clock . it little louder i expected its mechanical movements ( motor hums it moves sit up or lay down ) . if your child cannot remember how shut off barking , it automatically goes off itself under 1 minute .	1

now my son 5 , i look around good remote control car him , but i want it cheap one starters . this tyco thing perfect my purpose . it 3 rubber wheels no body , so it flip around doesn't matter - one side good ! it runs rather fast , but it isn't noisy so it doesn't drive me crazy . it turns perfectly , you get it flip , it flips if you run it against wall , so there no fear damage . five year old driver , dream come true ! remote transmitters takes one 9v , charger takes four aa batteries . my son plug car into charger 2 minutes , then he run it 10 minutes . it too bad they don't pictures here , but you envision it just engine 3 fat wheels . it little but it feels solid . my husband wrinkled his nose when i bought it ( " our kids get too many toys ! " ) , but once my son running it , he asked play it little , he won't let go until i forced him give it back ! even then , it big struggle get him give up control ! ( " i paid it ; why can't i play it ? " )highly recommended !	1

says its compatible hot wheels , but they don't work very well it . hot wheels either fall off track right away or go like 3 inches stop . cars come it work fine , but kids like variety get bored using same 2 cars over over . if your kid loses car , they don't sell replacements far i know . hopefully they eventually .	-1

any fans evil dead/army darkness series this very good figure . figure stands well its own good articulation , looks like character movie , over all good detail . it also alternate head placed ash jaw stretched out like aod after he sucked into necronmicon . figure comes boom stick gauntlet hand , only thing this figure missing attachable chainsaw hand 2 me really makes ash stand out . otherwise it still very impressive figure	1
since description this not give you good grasp exactly how book set up i first fill you . first couple pages maze game , which quite frankly i see no purpose really not interesting my child ... might work other kids though . following 26 letters alphabet capital lower case tracers each game area bottom page . last few pages game pages simple three letter word tracers . okay onto review ... we got my son leappad plus writing christmas last year ( he 3-years-old , now 4 ) . well needless say he become very bored pre-k books available so i got this one . he doing tracer pages learning how write his name little while now i thought this would reinforce him wanting learn how write other letters not his name . much my surprise he not even remotely interested doing tracer area pages , however , games bottom pages really hold his interest quite well . while he not yet really learning how write different letters little games bottom teaching him how spell simple words . this very exciting my son he finally starting understand abc more purpose than just song ! while he not really interested tracing whole page a or any other letter he gladly traces simple three letter words bottom pages associated games , thus still teaching him how write some letters . result this he learned spell cat , cow , mop , dog , gum which he verbally now without word spelled out front him . game mode simple understand directions fairly straightforward . occasionally , he runs across word he doesn't understand because it hasn't taught him yet , like buzzard , but his curiosity it provides great reason teach word . overall i give this 5 stars ... even though it didn't get him excited learning write his letters .	1
went searching perfect play house type toy our 3 yr old daughter ... thought i going get dora talking house but came across fisher price sweet streets ... you simply can't compare 2 . true , dora house may help teach spanish but all it house , figurines , couch ... other accessories expensive not easy find . this entire collection sweet streets however unbelievable ! it bright , good quality that typical fp toys , hours play imagination endless . i'm sure i can't explain it well enough it justice ... there entire ' community ' ( village , city , country ) ... all sold separately very reasonably priced . check out entire collection sweet streets -- it looks so fun i can't wait xmas play it , too ! some pieces lights sounds : dinner movie ; country store ; carousel -- all well , very realistic . i can't imagine she get bored playing this because there such huge variety plenty pieces/components add it over time	1
we bought this toy christmas gift our almost 3 year old he loves it ! even our 11 month old likes it ( he uses it help him walk ) . i think it fairly sturdy toy , but i could see how it may not last long children rough it . my son already ripped some cardboard food boxes because he check if there actually food them . so those may not last long cart . but overall , i think it pretty good toy price	1
i received my order last estimated date arrival , but packaging excellent product itself great condition .	1

great deal star wars legos . however our first set missing entire wing x-wing we get it replaced . my son really enjoyed building it really disappointed start over . built it again when we got replacement very proud . it really well priced set compared other star wars lego sets	1
could've gone two thumbs up due voice not cullen . other than , i love this toy . i agree little pricey tag but it all depends upon if you really want it if you really afford it . if you true hardcore tf fan like i am , then price should not factor you ( you'll find way get one ) . if not , then look cheaper alternatives	1
$65 , display base , its pretty obvious optimus not meant used child toy . its 20th anniversary optimus , its very clearly aimed those us who watched big guy battle evils decepticons original airing , really , those conditions this piece should judged . starters , detail this guy insane . individually jointed fingers ( optimus * almost * flip you off he so flexible , just fingers curved enough they don't really stand out their own ) , vents his legs open , his mouthpiece moves via button back make it look like he talking , its just amazing . right down posable toes . thats not even getting into things like commlinks his arms ( one features grimlock flip up screen , other megatron)while it true his grip his blaster less than perfect , i re-iterate optimus here meant posed put display , he wasn't meant hold onto his gun while 8 year old whips him around . all articulation posability he robot mode , fact he actually transforms just icing cake . i would still given this thing 4 out 5 stars , even if he didn't transform , he good . while his truck mode isn't nearly sexy his robot mode , i say it again , he meant posed put display , why world would you want pose him truck ? optimus prime currently standing tall my desk work , watching over my paperwork , i couldn't happier . quote this very piece , " autobots , transform roll out !	1
my kids wanting these toothbrushes since they saw commercials it . i thought it great idea . now matter how hard i try unless i stand right next my children every time they brush , they don't brush long enough . since they like most songs available these brushes , i thought this would work . well it work , i bought them today my four year old keeps picking his up brushing . he doesn't seem mind sound , but it horrible . i thought maybe it just needed new battery but battery not replacable . i not make this purchase again .	-1

this game alot fun great wide range ages . i played this 3 year olds , 9 year olds adults . younger set i set it up them help them way . they trouble putting sticks back . older kids play it well their own . i haven't it long so i can't say much durability , but we haven't broken anything yet ! sticks seem flimsy but i think their flexibility helps getting them put into holes . younger kids like playing ' whoever gets most marbels wins ' version . they like hearing sounds seeing lights come when marbles come down chute . they haven't gotten into strategy side it , but still fun . game super easy put away ( which big plus daycare setting ) . just make sure smaller kids supervised safety reasons ( they could choke or turn pieces into weapons )	1
this game ended up trash bin--it made cheap plastic , falls apart easily , it difficult get all sticks , nobody wants put sticks back because that very boring . i think my memory failed me -- i thought this used fun game when my kids little -- i sure don't remember all hassles it . but i've noticed quality games/toys nowadays very poor -- so many cheezy , cheapo parts . save your money buy something else	-1

we purchased over years both brio wooden thomas sets now take sets . i must admit , my husband i differ opinion them . i always leaned toward brio he take . i say , price brio sets steadily climbing over years i just can't/won't justify added expense ( it big difference way ) brio sets when my boys ( 4 18 months ) love take alongs every bit much expensive ones ! my son loves take roundhouse i love there place all trains . i also think some negative reviews bit unfair . we've saved bundle these sets my kids love them . thats good enough me	1

i don't know quite what think game . i guess i just expecting something better than what we ended up . cons1 . while game comes rules , there lot gray areas make things confusing . other hand , you opportunity " fill gaps " yourself . what we keep track decisions we made regarding what we when we hit gray areas . 2 . workmanship game leaves something desired . when we first tried card dispenser , it would dispense cards ok , but would not latch properly when you turned key . i ended up taking dispenser apart ( caution , there spring inside you need watch out ) cutting notch slightly deeper help make it latch when you turn key . it now works perfectly . reading other reviews , there apparently general quality-control issue regarding dispenser . 3 . when you spin spinner , it often hard tell which number showing you make up rule what when spinner ends up two numbers . pros1 . kids like play game . i would say it especially enjoyable those under age 10.2 . turning key pressing " go " fun way dispense cards . 3 . i really like way you ask other players help you out mutually bad situations . when you ask assistance , either you or player may sacrifice better board position good all players . you don't find this kind thinking often enough games . 4 . although this game not really match game movie , it probably good you going get money . if i it all over again , i would buy game . however , i would lower my expectations	-1

there isnt much say this . it hold 9 cards per page , sturdy construction , holes 3 ring binders . you put upto 5 cards per slot without causing any damage cards , limiting space wasted duplicate cards . 100 sheet pack you room upto 4500 trading cards	1
when your little one looking something brighten their day -- this fills bill . great fun toy bright colors , lots entertainment value . just don't let them know it teaching them same time . high value money -- great shower gift -- unisex	1
i bought this because i saw it friend house . nice idea - it teaches kids quickly follow spatial relationships . however when it arrived it turned out whole thing depends mechanical timer , timer defective . very frustrating !	1

my kids love ben-10 so it natural they would want whole she-bang during holidays ( rv characters watch ) . this cool action figure which comes its ship . it also convert into squirt gun which makes double fun ( unless their siblings don't want squirted course ) . it also makes it nice toy tub well . it pretty well made given price size larger than many smaller action figures because addition ship .	1
i say redone starscream pleasure buy . f-15 fighter looks real robot mode extremely poseable . only issues i it windscreen seen when robot mode it irritates me . second fact you cannot move arms full horizontal position since wings way . nose landing gear canopy open would nice too . but , overall very nicely . wait until you able get your hands ramjet ! he even better looking . he few issues himself , especially beginning wings leading edge restricting full downward position arms no nose landing gear or opening canopy , but i like this one better than starscream	1
i love my transformer but i'm 5 1/2 i still need some help grown up change it up . missiles broke off very first day	1
i say this updated version starscream quite nice . this starscream tall g1 version but his wings smaller . jet fighter mode more realistic looking than old starscream . i also like how robot mode looks more like cartoon character unlike g1 starscream . this starsceam definitely nice but there two things i not like it . first thing bothers me this starcream cheap plastic it made . plastic very flimsy when you try transform starscream . next thing i not like this starscream how null ray cannons not actually point straight out because back wings way . overall though this very nice looking collectors item . i wouldn't really call it toy because its questionable durability . i highly recommend not transforming this starscream too much because you may end up breaking those wing rudders his legs . if you want one these starscream get them while prices still reasonable . starscream hot seller alreadly hard find . don't wait this starscream if you want him . i already see people trying sell this starscream $30.00 dollars over msrp .	1

unless mattel meant this " doll " prostitute barbie , then they really missed mark . mattel - what you thinking ???? i half-laugh " children foundation " you listed your corporate page . what point children foundation if your also other end pouring trash into our children minds ? fact mattel ( or any parent matter ) would ever think this doll ok any child , any age , scary . i am 35 , i loved barbie child . if i ever seen this doll child i would thought it joke . sad , our standards dropped so far some people actually can't see what wrong this doll !!!! shame you , mattel	-1

this toy given my kids santa last christmas ( 2003 ) if you read above review you notice reviewer just looking dimensions - i don't think actually purchased toy . this thing rocks ! quality unsurpassed . my kids ( all three ages 2-7 ) hours fun play this washing machine . it fixture when they play house their dolls . it never leaks water - i leary when santa brought it . they graduated playing it carpet . i set up clothes line nice days outside they play ' laundry ' some clothes pins their doll clothes . it always favorite when we friends over . after year i not replaced batteries it hours hours use . there fill level side so you don't put too much water . kids see their doll clothes ( or socks or rubber balls or anything else they think put it ) spin during wash spin cycle . there 4 cycles : water , where water get clothes slightly damp , wash , where water sloshed around clothes , water out- yep you guessed it it drains , spin - where it spins heck out clothes . i worried how water ' drains ' but it just goes back into resevoir - when you playing we empty it out via hose back machine into sink . it small but perfect your child play house . it 12 inches high 10 inches deep . price little steep but amount play time you get out it - it well worth it . if you happen across dishwasher matches this set - i not recommend . not much action you get this one . this great toy - buy it confidence it become favorite .	1
i bought this my nephew first christmas , it favorite toy ! this wonderful toy - simple sweet , but most amazing feature ! when animal dropped through top tent , it makes it sound - lion roars , monkey chatters , etc . when animal taken out through front door tent , tent says it name , such ' lion ' or ' monkey ' . tent very sturdy animals soft just right size little hands . highly recommended	1

star wars trivial pursuit saga edition ( 2005 . ) introduction :d espite around since middle seventies , star wars series never declined its popularity . george lucas created science fiction phenomenon stood test time , then some . needless say , many games based series - video games , role-playing games , no shortage board games adapted star wars universe . 1998 , star wars trivial pursuit released . die-hard fan series , it far my favorite ( non video game ) star wars game ever . unfortunately , it outdated fast , due fact it didn't cover prequel trilogy it immediately followed . but 2005 , seven years three star wars episodes later , new version game hit store shelves ! read my review new version star wars trivial pursuit . overview : quite honestly , who doesn't know what trivial pursuit ? well , those you who living under rock all your life , here concept behind game . players alternate rolling die moving their game token across wheel-shaped board . there six different-colored spaces . each color represents different category . player then asked question category . if he or she gets it right , he or she goes again . if he or she misses it , it next player turn . six spots board wedge spaces . objective game gain wedge all six colors return central hub wheel , answer game-winning question . some changes this edition game , rather obviously , questions overall game design star wars based , two dvds , which contain wedge game-winning questions . new concept game includes player able " steal " if player unable answer wedge question , last few seconds time . essentially , game play stays play classic stylings trivial pursuit , but gives it star wars overhaul . other words , this game exactly what it says it . review : original star wars trivial pursuit , without question , my favorite star wars game all time wasn't video game . this new version massive improvement over old version . starters , new version covers entire star wars film saga . classic galactic civil war trilogy ( episodes iv , vi ) prequel clone wars trilogy ( episodes i , ii , iii ) all get equal emphasis . if you hated original version not covering prequel trilogy , problem , obviously , corrected , major way . dvds also add nice new twist game . it good finally method setting wedge questions apart regular questions . , course , you anywhere two four players or teams . i few minor complaints , though . first all selection tokens characters you play . original version luke skywalker , princess leia , han solo , darth vader . other words , nice assortment main characters . new version luke skywalker , darth vader , obi-wan kenobi , yoda . other words , only jedi characters . this strictly cosmetic flaw , but still , i think they could picked better assortment characters than those four . complaint inclusion die . those you who never played original version game , it included electronic r2d2 figurine which would tell you how many spaces move when you tapped its head , via lcd screen . i liked better than rolling die because it helped give game unique star wars feel playing die just doesn't . problem price game - i've seen it everywhere $45 $60 ! even lowest msrp , it still rip off . one biggest problems one most obvious - if you're not die-hard star wars fan , you not get very far this game . my last biggest complaint questions themselves - like original game , they horribly imbalanced . some questions so simple , casual fan could answer them easily . some so difficult , even die-hards trouble them . this brings me my complaint dvd questions . not only these questions really no more difficult than card questions , but time ticks down , questions become easier ! this makes it ridiculously easy player " steal " wedge if question receiver unable answer . if i designing game , i'd straighten up these flaws . but i'm not , overall , i am very satisfied it . edition notes : this game fairly recent release , it remains readily available most major stores sell board-style games movie merchandise . if you want game , it shouldn't too hard - just ready pay fairly high price it . overall :d espite some minor issues , this new version star wars trivial pursuit leaps-and-bounds improvement over original game . if you're huge fan series who thinks your knowledge series supreme , don't hesitate buy this game . there many star wars trivia games/books/etc . over years , but star wars trivial pursuit ultimate star wars trivia experience . no fan should pass this game up	1

i absolutely love my little pony petal parlor . it hasn't fallen apart me even once . ponies come it really cute . i no problem braiding their hair this toy . braids come out quite well barely any tangling . i don't know what people fussing . my opinion , you're just not careful , reading instructions properly , or rushing get it together . i'd say you're even breaking deliberately claiming it not durable . same goes other playsets . my advice you , quit whining complaining . just enjoy ponies if you don't like toy	1

my 10 month old twins love this hand puppet - they endlessly entertained fake-growling oscar impression . convenient hand puppet makes it really easy take mealtimes travel . some reason , they respond more oscar than cookie monster - perhaps it because his eyebrows ! anyhow , this high-quality puppet only thing i think lacking mouthpiece little hard move same time arms .	1

i'm afraid previous reviewer misses point maze . it designed allow user shift walls they progress through maze ; it not intended static maze if paper . there 16 starting configurations listed back product , they increase difficulty they progress . early settings require either no or very limited manipulation walls complete . you go more advanced settings , however , you encounter ever-more-complicated mazes require you plan ahead determine whether moving given wall help you or hurt you long run . this great toy teach strategic thinking , suitable variety ages ( some more advanced maze configurations quite challenging )	1
simply , big tex pistol ( likely any pistol or rifle made this company ) awesome ! 40 something who grew up westerns , i recently introduced my nine six year olds several old western classics ( they love butch cassidy sundance kid ) based their positive response , i set out find some quality western toys them play . sadly , western genre no longer cultural currency finding any cowboy related toy , book , or other frustrating there little select . i found big tex ( parris ) amazon search pleasantly surprised . these guns remind me quality you would expect product made 1950's/60 . it heavy duty very well made nice heft action . fit finish flawless very accurately detailed . plastic wood grip looks like wood . antiquing metal perfect , too . gun release lever open barrel allowing 12 round cap cylinder removed pretend reload or use related 12 round caps ( which also worked perfectly ) . action gun very sound . your children fire this over over no fear internal parts coming uncoiled or breaking . $13 , this toy great , great value . only issue i trying track down quality gun belt match guns . lastly , this clearly polarizing discussion point ( probably illegal ) , i must confess i'm not fan orange barrel end caps . they ok star wars gun , but i didn't grow up them my cowboy guns i feel they ruin look gun such , i prefer remove them ( again , cowboy guns only ) . orange end cap these guns very well attached ( again - great quality ) . should you inclined remove them , i suggest screwing sheetrock screw directly into center cap create small opening . then , well ventilated area , use bbq grill lighter hold open flame orange cap flame directed small opening . plastic smoke begin melt away , after couple minutes , render small opening center cap soft enough insert flathead screwdriver so you easily pry cap housing barrel end . you may whittle way inside bit , reheat repeat this process couple times until core housing comes out . there good smudge black soot barrel , but it rubs off completely zero discoloration or damage antiqued finish . if you looking classic , good ole cowboy gun your kids reminds you toy you would grown up - - this one buy .	1
my six-year-old got this her easter basket . she loves all kinds art so we thought this would something fun different her . not so . first page worked she loved it , but markers started dry out very quickly . time she got second page , markers no longer worked well enough dissolve black coating . my daughter colored over same area 100 times still got only faintest bit neon show through . she very frustrated heartbroken her easter present such dud . i'd expect quality like this roseart , but not crayola . what complete waste money time	-1

my [ .. ] [ .. ] love this magic set ! 12 yr old taught 5 yr old how simpler tricks . after she got over shock magic tricks really just slight hand not real magic , she enjoyed doing tricks others . some tricks little more complex , so she something grow into . we even few tricks our neighbor , she amazed ! she couldn't figure out secret ! course , [ ... ] gave it away ! i really not thought 5 yr old losing her innocence magic when i bought kit . i just remember fun these kits when i kid . so i pass this piece advice if you concidering this younger child . she upset day , because she thought we all trying cheat her tricks instead using real magic . it took quite bit explaining	1

this house so much fun ! it went together rather quickly ; i put it together myself under 20 minutes . best part this house me it fun me add while my daughter plays it . what i mean add this : only thing i really disliked house ( this minor nitpick ) door handle . it bright white just clashed house . i went home depot purchased ' santa fe style ' drawer pull it looks tons better . this all started lizard embossed side . it screamed color ! i painted it artist acylic paint it looks nice . then i started paint cactus pots . then i added knob inside . then i started paint stone siding . next i am going add hanging plants like they picture . picture i added doesn't much painting ( i took it early project ) but when i am i'll take more pictures . bit excessive ? perhaps ! nevertheless , we both enjoyed house personalizing it one kind . acrylic paint not come off weather nor jet-waterhose . before you go painting it , try it hidden place . i would hate you ruin your playhouse my advice ! fyi , i used liquitex artist paint not thinner crafty stuff comes bottle . short , proceed your own risk , but know there tons ( non-permanet ! ) ways you customize this house . add house numbers side . put name plate up . fun it ! last thing i say this : if price seems bit much look up used ones online - they almost sell same price new one ! so , when time comes you want part it , you'll more than likely get good price it	1

i'll preface this review saying i actually like this toy . i really like shuttle mode robot mode design pretty cool . said , it its issues . train mode just plain weird . it looks like somebody took bullet train stuck extra chunk boxiness it . i don't mind fact he now bullet train instead old-school smokestack model ( it not like those kinds trains even exist anymore ) , i just think actual train design slightly off . arms robot mode also bit problem . cockpit train covers his hands forearms bit too much . i think look his robot mode awesome , but forearms could much better only little bit work . however , he triple changer he cheap , so if you don't let these things bother you too much , it nice purchase	1
this action figure really fantastic , mixture silver black makes batman look totally awsome intimidateing . he five points articulation not break unless you really put some force into it . only problem this toy body poportion ( his legs look pathetic compared his overly musclular upper body ) way main frame like all other jl figures other than these minor flaws this figure please any batman lover	1

my 5 year old daughter received this toy her birthday . unlike others , we not trouble dolphins . perhaps this because my daughter often takes them off herself play them seperately . this toy seems much sturdier than barbie carriages pulled horses , where horses often fall over or become unattached too easily . all all , it seems well made me	1

my husband i became friends fans several years after show started . we're hardly groupies , but we own every season dvd we love games , so our anniversary this year , i bought scene it ? friends edition . i didn't know what expect , but game doesn't take long understand or play , unlike many other games , it still fun just 2 players . we surprised how much we , or didn't , know show . which brings me my next point ... box implies non-friends fans play this game , but i don't see how that possible . many questions we've seen could only answered someone who seen show . so , before you invite people join you game , make sure they really know show . but friends fans love it ! enjoy .	1

i think sea monkeys great pets . i really enjoy watching them toodle around their care-free manor it very relaxing . tank fun watch them it neat looking back ground . read instrucions thoroughly several times it could cause health crisis if you not sure only feed once week . not over feed it caused resent death all my sea monkeys . you need arorate tank dayly , aqua leash adiquit put it water push not suck inward it inafective way . repeat several times . all all , i basicly told you every thing there . aditional info . go www.sea monkeys.com, click third icon " taking care pet sea monkeys " this answer any aditional info .	1
this great supplement our play kitchen . there lot pieces this set , which 3 or 4 big gadgets like mixers , food processors , blenders , etc . those items battery powered . i haven't put battteries them they use it pure pretend play mode . my reasons liking this product : good variety items contained set , pieces durable ( they plastic , but hard , smooth plastic don't ' cheap ' look feel ) , toy getting lot play use , basic simple toy terms allowing kids pretend play without entertainment noise automation . addition , i still option put batteries enjoy toy level too .	1
i just love hearing these sounds . they so relaxing except horse . i am not one whinnying . it sounds like barnyard . i really like munching slurping sounds . they sound pretty . i just make those munching slurping sounds all day . if i lived foreign country could hire someone push those sounds inexpensive wage i might it . i really don't think would cruel job like sweatshop , i mean all you would make those noises pushing toys . don't report me amnesty international or anything !!! so basically if you like slurping or munching noises you going get addicted this farm set . get it !	1

it fun find unusual prereader games , since we four-year-old " cat person " home , this perfect . directions easy , even humorous ( person shortest pinky goes first ) . game fast-paced ends time suits attention span . cat dish little flimsy side , but easily enough replaced any old bowl home if it splits . we think purple wooden mice scream . this perfect after-dinner game play when you just want short game doesn't get everyone too wound up before getting ready bed	1
we bought this game play our sons ( ages 3 5 ) they love it ! it easy learn , quick play , lot fun . unlike some kid games out there , it not mind numblingly dumb or boring . our boys love able roll dice each time -- believe it or not , this one two games we own where there no tantrums over who won who lost . they just ask play again , again , again ! it even good kids who aren't counting very high , both kids engaged while we play . there probably more educational games around , but this one just plain fun . :) quick ' how ' this game : roll two dice . sleeping kitty - nothingarrow - pass one your mice person your leftmouse - take mouse bowlfood bowl - feed kitty one your miceso if you roll arrow food bowl , you pass one mouse left put one bowl . last person mice left wins . very simple play i said up above , it quick moving game -- no time get bored	1
i've only used traders builders inns cathedrals expansions , but i've also carcassone city carcassone without expansions . four variations i've played , carcassone traders builders definitely most interesting . variations game already described well other reviewers , so i'll limit my comments what makes expansion so interesting : -the trade goods give players incentive complete other players ' cities ; other versions game , players often avoid other players cities because they don't want expand city ( adding city value ) close city ( causing city scored ) . -in addition ot fun twist , builder also great way speading up game . i think it actually took us less time play this expansion despite learning new rules adding tiles . if you own carcassone , you should own this expansion	1
we given this game gift so addicted we purchased board game version which even more fun ( but better 3+ players ) . anyone who visits our house gets hooked well . card game good 2 players makes good gift $15-20 , board game more like $30-40 . we also invested some expansion sets computer version . don't let rules bog you down begining , you enjoy this game	1
i just went bought expansion card set ( five new themes ! ) am looking forward adding these cards into basic game . kid local game store told me board game , but i looking two-person game i could take vacation me my fiance paris . it very compact game pack , but don't try play it plane space required set up cards . bed , floor , or table perfect . anyhow , this game lot fun allows various defensive offensive strategies tested ( i.e. build knight strength /or commercial enterprise , build towns cities , use spies or libraries etc . ) , includes some luck , good memory . each game i've played pretty close , so it retains its value over time . it takes up least two or so hours , but time limit adjusted limiting victory point total . all all , great alternative way spend evening home , or abroad late into night your significant other hiding out nasty ( dollar-euro ) exchange rates	1
our three year old loves her desk chair . they very sturdy seem well built . they came right out box , almost no assembly required . finish construction really nice she seems very comfortable drawing playing . overall very pleased	1

frog juice great ! it fun play great if you're working addition . if your worrying it " little kiddies " it won't . my sister ( 15 ) her friends love this game . it slightly hard understand first time you play catching not too hard . one my favorite aspects game illustrations playing cards they're great . imaginative illustrations absolutely fantastic . overall i would highly recommend this game	1
this great game play any event i first learned it my softball summer camp . we played every night it very very fun . its easy play u play hour	1
i sad discover this not nearly fun its brother mattel football handheld . play modes not well-defined : level one too slow level two too fast even after hours play . buttons much less durable feeling than one would expect casing . kitch value makes it cool your coffee table , but most people pick it up , play it once or twice , say same thing " where football one like this ?	-1
this puzzle perfect my 7 year old attracted interests my 5 3 year old . every homeschooler should look into purchasing this puzzle enhance geography lessons .	1
i tried order this last christmas but it sold so well it out stock ! great price amp ; great buy , i signed up waiting list amp ; finally got it couple days ago . its really hard find good map us amp ; good price . this covers every state , major cities marked amp ; capitols marked . i looked other maps store but never bought one because it didnt things i looking . plus they very expensive . this help our child learning where all states amp ; know capitols . we all learn them school amp ; this fun way it . also way rest family brush up this information	1
we got this christmas present played it once , kids i bored it . us , it wasn't really much challenge game ended way too quickly . also , game not look like it could stand rough play , which i think definitely happen this game . honestly , playing " go fish " regular playing cards more fun than this game	-1

my 7 year old got this his 6th birthday both he his 5 year old brother really enjoy this game . we suggested rules roll dice twice speed game up when our youngest playing . my children discovered often times dinosaur who appears weakest actually wins , so there no fighting over who gets what dinosaur . those families who prefer board games reading over tv , this game you . yes , it requires longer attention span than most games , but so average school classroom . cheers game doesn't " talk down " kids !!	1
my family use this game weekends instead watching tv , great fun family get togethe	1
my daughter just got this doll her 3rd birthday . we tried two sets batteries it never swam . she enjoys playing it anyway . but top pain put back . i hope my friend not spend lot money this gift . i not recommend buying it	-1

i love this game !! you collect cool bean cards into gardens then harvest them gold coins . best thing this game very cooperative . you trade people because you not allowed change order you hand you plant top , it takes some strategy sometimes really nice get ahead ! i recommend highly all older players ( i am 30 ) well younger	1
how anyone not like this game ? how anyone not interested learning german name soybeans ? how anyone not want get know deeper bean trading skills your friends ? this game fun , easy explain , easy learn . when i teach it people , we usually not need trial round . it intuitive , there bean planter all us . i taiwaneese , south african , indian , hongkong , australian friend who all asked me get this game germany . shame amazon doesn't it moment !!	1
this game , three-color code , using zoo animals , great kids . ( regular mastermind four colors ) . everyone my four year old ten year old their friends love playing it . it great teaching logical deduction . even if some pieces get lost , long you don't lose too many you still play game . highly recommended , " rush hour kids , " which builds same skills	1
grandma showed him how work buttons 7 months he 9 months old now . he doesn't really understand how it works still . he hits it , drops it when music comes out he bobs his head . he likes it very much . i often turn it him . i think australian kids who sing many songs get lyrics occasionally wrong like ; " now i know my abcs tell me what you think me " instead " next time won't you sing me . " oh well he won't ever know difference . it helps me sing him . tunes short jog my memory so i sing all sorts tunes i wouldn't otherwise sing without prompting . this creates more daddy time . great toy . most his stuff he suck he hasn't used this teethe . i would take it away him i think because our boy so wet this holes it speaker . maybe not we musical rattles too	1
this version sasquach alpha flight comics . it great figure . sasquach also appears exiles comic series , age apocalypse sabretooth ( who convieniantly appear ml sxvi ) . this great figure well scale , abotu twice size astonishing x-men wolverine . cardbacks list wolverine 5'3 " , sasquach 10 ' . i both regular variant sasquach ( which technically snowbird sasquach form ) . both look amazing , well sculpted , though variant slightly more interesting paint ops , white base , blue black really bring out highlights lowlights . it great see two sasquaches pitted against one . it would nice see issue alpha flight which sasquach , snowbird sasquach squared off , since it would able show both figure variant origin quite nicely . but i've noticed comic reprints chosen more often than not their covers , which usually feature character they're packed quite prominately . whether or not character very much actual story line . sasquach seems pretty easy comr , however , finding variant may little harder . both worth adding your collection . don't let fact this more obscure character stop you picking one up , not just apocalypse piece either . i first saw character listed this series , puzzled , thinking i might not even get one , but after picking it up , very pleasantly supprised . here hoping some other alpha flight members get ml treatment , such vindicator , guardian , snowbird ; some exiles ( nocturne ! ) too	1
get cool figure build your own 14 " massive apocalypse figure which looks awesome might well sculpture . articulated sculpture ! sasquach comes massively muscled arm apocalypse arm tube . tube goes apocalypse waist his elbow looks cool but i guess it transports elbow grease or something . sasquach comes one more detailed sculpts but his color scheme little less exciting he mostly brown ( or white if you get variant ) . however , this huge guy who towers over other regular figures sculpt articulation excellent . some articulation even hidden scuplt ( such cut wrists ankles ) which always cool . very fun he always looks ready beat crud out someone . very solid buy even if you don't want whole apacalypse , which would nuts , but still .	1
my 5 year old 3 year old always fighting over swing swing set . when i bought this hung it tree . my 5 year old loved idea " swinging tree " i feel safe her it . just make sure branch strong enough take weight motion swing	1

there excitement my two year old nephew opened his present his birthday . fact he fell asleep engines says it all !	1
my son got bunch books/cartridges little touch leapad christmas . it hard keep track all it , so when i saw this bag i immediately bought it . everything fits perfectly inside it great travel !! it keep cartridges more secure i put them sandwich bag before pocket , other than i just use it . this great accessory little touch leappad	1
concept good , however it just not functional . game system itself barely fits inside . there 2 small pockets storeage game books cartridges ... which if you more than two barely fit . it not organize well i am afraid cartridges fall out some point . this product not worth $20 we paid it	-1
my son extensive thomas collection his little sister always " messing things up " . it his idea buy this her christmas . now when she goes into his room mess up his track , he gets out lady , builds her simple circle track lets her play her own train next him . it worked like charm .... no more " mom , she tearing up my tracks "	1
i really dont know how whole soap opera saga going ken barbie since i played them last myself 30 years ago or so , but i bought this guy blaine my 3 1/2 year old substitute " julian " princess pauper-i bought both girls christmas each anneilese erika doll also purchased wedding clothes ken queen princess . my 5 year old given ken swan lake ( blonde)last year her birthday-he resembled julian both my girls previously ken " king dominic " but my little one not " julian " swan lake blonde ken no longer available , so i got her blaine . he worked out just fine except fact this guy expressionless-no smile or smirk blaine ??? least ken smile his face-looks like blaine sullen expression he ate too many those power bars he supplied box . my daughter asked why her " julian " (blaine ) not look like her sisters " julian " ???? i told her , " julian tutoring anneilese all day courtyard very sunny day forgot his sunscreen . " it didn't fool her-but she just fine blaine .	1
it true barbie ken never married , but those correcting others here barbie relationship kelly need open their eyes . we so gullible we're going believe barbie kelly her sister ? barbie dates era where it not uncommon unwed pregnant girl shipped " stay her aunt " year , then after her return she would conveniently gain " baby sister " . marlon brando went most his life call his grandmother " mom " his mother " sis " ; google it details . images text accompanying set barbie pushing kelly stroller makes it clear what their true relationship	1
i purchased this item when it sale $20 . after using it few days , here my first impressions . good : it already comes batteries both remote ( 9v alkaline ) car ( rechargeable charger ) . it also adjustable wheel alignment make sure it goes straight when you want go straight . tires work well carpet should work well concrete/asphalt ( haven't taken it outside yet ) bad : charge time vs . play time horrible . average charge time 4-5 hours ! usable run time anywhere 30-45 minutes tops . also , battery uses older ni-cd cells . todays battery technology i would liked see ni-mh or li-ion battery optional quick charger . tires very hard . this translates really bad traction control tile or hardwood floors . r/c also poor torque . without getting it up speed , this r/c trouble pushing small stuff animals out way over small bumps or obsticles . i my doubts actual " off-road " usability . jeep rubicon ford 350 also available which i imagine same parts underneath just different body " shells " . overall , it still fun item $20 . price tag . i wouldn't spend more than	1
i few reservations it , some game mechanics overly complicated .... which some people may seem like oportunity extra strategy , but same time it means picking up this game somewhat pain because some thing non intuitive . it true there no 1 non winning strategy it better more players . however i prefer san juan ( which same company , * very * similar . i view san juan cleaned up version puerto rico , it may * slightly * less complex game , but doing accounting stuff alot easier it less poinless fiddly bits , which i feel results more fun game	1
puerto rico kind game gets people hooked start . if you hardcore gameboard player , buy it . you not regret it . way , somebody amazon tell me why you dont sell more games rio grande company	1
lost cities captivated my wife me -- we play almost every other day . game certainly deserves its accolades , including " best game couples , " real simple ( which how we discovered it ) . gameplay extremely straightforward ( imagine two player competitive solitaire) -- it only took 10 minutes us get going , we haven't stopped since . you become more experienced , game become very strategic , elements deception sabotage . it great after-dinner game , it'll feed your appetite puzzles , competition , entertainment	1
i'm wife guy who loves games . i'm more into console pc games , but rarely touch board/table top games . my husband other hand loves both equally . we decided try spend more quality time together , trying out different things we each like decided compromise . i would play table-games more often if we could play them some time coffee shop ( he hates coffee ! hehe ) he got this game , i addicted immediately ! it easy learn , quick play ( 20-40 mins game ) , fun exciting , we equally matched win ! ( i've beaten him quite few times , thank you very much!)i've even taken this game out meet some girlfriends gotten them hooked it , too . one friend even requests i bring it me just case we get chance play ! hurrah !! ( box small enough fit my purse , too ! haha)me my husband also really enjoy carcassonne : castle , if you care game suggestion . it also meets requirements easy learn , fun play , we're both evenly matched win . enjoy !	1
product good product but it unreliable . i bought it locally my daughter when i took it home it broken ... when letter placed machine machine would say different letter , thouroughly confusing little one . i returned it got one english ... this time it worked my daughter enjoyed it . i bought third one via amazon gift shipped overseas . when it arrived , i told it broken showing same symptoms one i originally bought ... $20 down drain ...	-1
i don't like this game all . it boring , if you can't think answers while , then you want leave , which exactly what i why i'm writing this review . i can't stand it . concept so-so , but game isn't . it so slow , people i play never seem fun , they just finish find out if they'll win or not . boring ....	1
this game so much fun !! i love word play - games actually exercise your mind - this one excels it ! it great range ages .... young children learning vocabulary well older audience . ( it even fun social get togethers - cocktails help bring out some really outrageous word combinations ! ) dice good size graphics easily read . i highly recommend this game . friends i used get together play catch phrase parties - now we break out visualeyes ! it also nice because it so user friendly - so easy understand - not lot rules try remember . it just good fun !	1
we resisted buying these because they seemed so cheap ... also usual question we parents always ask ourselves ... " what they going them ? " our son received his first bionicle friend his ninth birthday ... it cleverly " bow " birthday present . i now regret overlooking this wonderful line " lego " so long ! my boys love these ! they best time building them even better time playing them . they priced reasonably so you always pick-up one treat during trips out " shopping " . if you encourage your children " save-up " some their " wants " , cost these low enough it doesn't take them months months realize their goal . please not make same mistake i made misjudge these toys . you denying your child great experience . although manufacturer suggests ages 7 up , i not feel child younger than 8 or 9 would able indendently put this toy together . my 7 year old needs some help putting these together , but he loves try all himself . point lego , construct play . primary benefit , my opinion , satisfaction " doing it " yourself ! definate a+ our boys ! rosemary	1
why ? why you keep using , same old colors ? why such high prices ? it much more than i get my allowance , pete sake ! good luck	1
if you read my reviews lego products , you see i repeated my self all them , because these people never fail amaze me new product lines . city line youngsters ( i bought it 7 y/o ) . he fun it , i think i won't trouble finding gift any coming occasions . people please believe me when i tell you , i played legos when i young , now my both boys playing their products too ... not buy building products other than lego	1
i friend young daughter who given bratz doll gift . her mom thought doll " inappropriate " dressed too racy . my friend asked me take look these dolls tell her what i thought . she asked me if she should take doll away her little girl . now i find myself , twenty something year old woman no kids , middle barbie vs bratz doll war . so i looked dolls both online stores omg they gorgeous ! i loved this one particular . cloe really pretty doll , i thought her highlighted hair awesome very realistic , looks kind like my hair fact ! i think bratz original , beautiful creative i no problem all way they dressed . this version cloe i found very non-offensive wondered how earth parent could find anything wrong here . she covered , not showing too much skin . girls wear stuff like this . big deal . i don't see what all fuss honestly . parents really this lame ? i don't think bratz any worse than barbie ( least bratz more realistic looking body ! ) fact i feel line focuses far more individuality creativity . bratz all races colors all different styles personalities not ' cookie cutter ' looking like barbie . these dolls hot i wish they made stuff like this when i kid . so i told my friend " lighten up , it only toy ! if she likes it let her keep it . " perhaps i would feel differently if i kids . apparently there lot parents who dislike these dolls but my opinion old fogies should get program ! this how women dress , many teenage pop stars young celebrities wear things like this tv it no big thing . women fashions seen lot change . 1950 girls would get trouble if skirt above their knees , now it no big deal . times change toys change . bratz modern interpretation dreams young girls today , just barbie represented what their mom grandmas wanted when they grew up . after checking out bratz ( cloe my fave ) clothing i new inspiration outfits next time i go out my bf ! all girls out there who love bratz : these dolls pretty , so play them fun don't mad if your parents don't let you dress like bratz . when you adult you wear whatever you want ! i loved glamour fashion little girl i always .	1
this one thing my 5 year old asked christmas -- it looked very cheap i didn't think it would work . i wrong --- it works very well . she needs help using it but it makes beautiful designs she finds all movement very entertaining ... i would get this birthday present 5-8 year old girl	1
my 3 year old daughter wanted this because she saw it tv . she played it day we brought it home hasn't asked it since . pens hard fit , foot stamps didn't really work well , either . we made big page drawings some newsprint paper then after pens ran dry because she forgot cap them , i no idea if replacements even sold . later day we just forgot him drawing toy just played him if he big plastic bug . now he back box . i wish i would saved my money bought drawing board or maybe nice spirograph . i always try avoid gimmicky toys like these but it seems i can't quite ever learn lesson	-1

my daughter 2 years old when she got her videonow jr loved it . she soon able play discs herself . but she loved it too much soon out batteries . so i thought i could buy car adaptor it just like videonow my older daughter , but no . what i'm most frustrated . i bought second adapter no use it . so if you buy videonow jr prepared buy alot batteries	1
maybe it my imagination , but when i played pacman here , it seemed better than original pacman joystick . just seemed sharper joystick great response . i enjoyed playing pacman plus it edgier than regular pacman . eating " fruit " also causes ghost monsters go blue , but they vanish first few seconds making eating them all more challenging . sometimes random ghostmonster not turn blue when you eat energizer . short , it unpredictable makes replay value pretty high . pac-n-pal , bit more odd ball . when you energize you push button shoot beam ghostmonsters . plus there 5th ghostmonster " pal " who steals your fruit , but can't kill you . eat fruit before he carries it into center box . course , if you fan super pacman , this game rendition close you get . remember , tv screens not same aspect ratio or resolution arcade monitor , so try not gripe over graphics . game play there , what matters . i never got feeling this weak remake , but felt it better quality . some reason , my joystick only one button . very well worth money super pacman pacman plus , alone	1
wow , what great game ! i would highly recommend this game anyone looking new game try or those who already know love it . instructions contain some new variations which spice up game bit those us who played it years . it pretty easy learn full fun large groups ( we've played double decks larger groups)and only couple people . this new set comes great hard silver case , full new colors , cards good sturdy , hold up well use . i highly recommend this new 25th anniversary set	1
when i opened box , he so excited . he blast them	1

time this model came out , it largest set 3104 bricks . it took me several days ( 12 - 16 hours ) assemble it . model very impressive its size almost 1 meter ( 37 inches ) . even though meantime lego released death star ( model #10143 ) more 3449 bricks , this still biggest one ( size wise ) around . definitely must-have lego/star wars fans	1
if you thomas series wooden railway series , then all means , sure you get duck . he just one older trains , almost each every video . he doesn't usually large role , but he kind good friend all engines . this guy gets taken bed our house also , everywhere we go . it pretty funny listening all role playing going carseat this guy hey , he even dance wiggles ! these trains definitely develop imagination fine motor skills , but they also become friends . these wooden guys very durable too . they don't chip like you'd think they would when dropped onto floor . we plan keeping our wooden train series interconnecting them " real " train set when our little one gets older . also , don't forget check out ho series thomas here amazon . i didn't know they existed what neat way introduce your little one fascinating world trains . something they definitely grow up use quite some time . highly recommend duck	1

we finally got around getting this , well , truth told , my wife got it off my wish list my birthday . we've played couple times starting get hang it . it bit more complicated longer play , there more things keep track probably lot different types ways win . i recommend getting this upgrade if you haven't tried it yet . if you're new catan games , you definitely want start off learning basic game first , before trying this out , but once you've played basic game few times , you'll want move several expansion packs try them ou t.t he best thing this game ( others series ) each game made different using few random factors , such moving resources around before starting also how you decide tackle position you end up when it comes deciding who goes first . using different expansion packs this basic game played thousands different ways depending how dice fall good player get challenged average player . this series comes strong recommendation .	1
this game addition game settlers catan . our family really enjoyed game settlers . we didn't think this game could improved upon . however , since we added addition , cities knights , we cannot go back just plain settlers catan . this game intrigue , planning , chance strategy all rolled into one game . even members our family don't often play games , love this game . we heartily recommend it teenagers adults . it really great game	1
my kids ( ages 2 3 ) love this . they played it entire summer into fall . their friends come over it keeps them all busy so long , its great . my kids usually never sit still ! i really recommend it . we love it	1
this much bigger than i thought it would great gift child loves bratz cats . meow	1
my daughter received this puzzle gift when she 18 months old she quickly learned how puzzle correctly . she loved matching up animal puzzle pieces animals pictured puzzle slots . she also loves telling me which animals make which sounds . red plastic knobs little bit small her first , but i think just because she used large wood knobs her other wood puzzles . my main complaint this puzzle animals not painted puzzle -- instead they some sort laminated paper or something like . so when she would chew puzzle pieces ( teething babies apt !! ) she able very quickly make small pieces pictures disintegrate . i don't encourage her chew puzzle pieces , but she sometimes slip them into her mouth . anyhow , now all animals look little strange around edges -- wood intact , but pictures disintegrated bit . fun puzzle , but finish pieces definitely ought more appropriate young children . this puzzle isn't quite up high standards most melissa doug toys	1

while i am not crazy his gun mode , i absolutely love megatron robot mode . his head resembles g1 cartoon version megatron . some slight problems - megatron head seems pretty small compared his body . green color his " wings " seems off rest figure . also , lastly orange end his cannon even more off than green . purple right his coloring scheme galvatron . too bad takara didn't use this color purple reissue galvatron rather than light purple . overall this figure worth it if you want robot version megatron . his gun mode not so appealing , but robot mode rules	1

this ridiculous , you all praise multi-billion ( that right ) dollar corporation donates $ 100,000 susan komen breast cancer foundation when you clearly know this corporation capable donating millions . mattel corp like many other american corporations main concern generate great revenue before anything else . this task accomplished through publicity stunts like this , creating pink ribbon barbie few proceeds going susan komen breast cancer foundation created large publicity increase sales their products . turn , they've received more advertising than actually paid through this tactic . if wasn't enough , majority mattel products made third world nations such china where most if not all their resources obtained . estimated actual cost this particular barbie packaging around $2.50 ( pair nikes retail over $100 usd costs less than $3 make ) , given $2.50 donated every pink ribbon barbie produced sold total mattel corp donated sunsan komen breast cancer foundation total 40,000 pink ribbon barbie produced sold ( i honestly believe there more than 40k units produced personally ) . so math follows , doll sells $25.00 , mattel spends $2.50 each unit additional $2.50 donations , profit total mattel corp each pink ribbon barbie comes out $20 800% profit total cost . but lets more realistic , say there additional costs haven't calculated all , estimated calculation these additional costs mattel corp still brings home 700% profit per doll . mattel corp no way philanthropist .	-1

we've number gazillion bubble machines . first - this one , upright rotating set bubble wands - worked relatively well , but stopped working after maybe dozen uses . ( granted , one those uses few hours ) . when level liquid low , machine stops making bubbles since it pick up enough liquid cover wand . we replaced it next year typhoon machine - this awesome , produced huge quantity bubbles worked more reliably since bubble liquid sucked up put wands , no matter how low supply liquid . it large reservoir bottom so you don't need fill it very often - it takes lot liquid though . our issue now getting liquid . gazillion liquid produce best bubbles - they last well , etc . etc . etc . however , very few stores stock liquid , except when i first bought first machine , o-o ne stocks large size bottles . even online vendors like toys.com who supposed them , never them stock ( i've their notify list long time ! ) i've ended up buying someone canada ebay - otherwise , buying smaller bottles toysrus , target , etc . just too expensive . both these machines don't really work if you try other bubble liquids - other liquids ( especially cheaper kinds very large size bottles ) much thinner liquid drips right off wands before it chance pass blower part make any bubbles . we're planning start making our own bubble liquid hopefully cover us . otherwise , machines useless now .	-1

i disagree other reviews . i think ' read me ' part system great ; however , games terrible . not because content , but because controls extremly slow respond . half time it not acknowledge correct answer , says it wrong , but we know we selecting correct answer . maybe it my dvd player , but i don't think so . i also wish stories could little bit longer , or perhaps they could put multiple stories disk . anyway system great reading stories children , but games lacking functionality .	1
i recently purchased this item my kids love it ! product involves several components different skill levels , i could see my kids playing long time . reading other reviews it looks like they might gotten defective items . we not encounter problem others spinners warping .	1
my daughter received this her 5th birthday . she some ballet experience so we thought she would pick up this rather quickly . only one portion dvd really instructional-and part fast fast fast ! i say fast ?! thank goodness rewind feature dvd -- this music redundant -- but that ok -- my daughter loves it . she so wants follow dancing but there little no actual step-by-step instruction . it basically several cute bubbly girls dancing away plastic numbered mat . upside -- she still loves her microphone headset singing . this product could easily improved adding chapters varying difficulty level so allow younger children catch . label say 5 years up	-1

moment , this starter set series , although they show even smaller dizzy set catalog but it not yet available . you get benny , fence , orange cone , window building piece . there isn't much build after putting benny together , but you can't expect much price . little benny front loader rear scoop , so your child should love playing him . other plus benny he small stout out all bob duplo characters , he withstands heavier play without his pieces popping off . one downside he only one ( although dizzy probably other if it ever released ) not able fit little bob character inside . all other sets come bob figure but this one	1

this must if you geotrax starter set . my son received basic tracktown railway 2 1/2 we immediately went out bought him elevation track packs . adults set layout up , its little bit trickier 3 dimensions , but elevation what makes geotrax way better than any other train set ! only drawback you can't just buy one elevation track pack . this one you need because it most ramps , but you buy one able anything once you get up top . i recommend flats set . we 1 each 3 elevation packs that enough connect all elevation accessories we ( clock tower , suspension bridge , mile high mountain ) . definitely add your geotrax , its worth it ! your child love it so you	1

we bought two these replace old , worn out swings play set we inherited when we bought our current house . this their second season they survived winter snows drastic fluctuations utah weather wonderfully . even protective plastic tubing over chain like new condition after out weather all year . we just purchased expensive , large wooden set i surprised find included swings aren't good quaility these . we're going hold onto these swings even when we get rid rest older set since they so well made . they also large enough fit my bum just fine . i'm not very big person , but i still impressed how comfortable they -- not pinching or tight through hip all . i sit out my kids swing without getting uncomfortable least . i think these every bit good , if not better than swings sell $60 more .	1
single player pack definitely not pointless . yes , it more expensive if you're getting multiple taggers , or even use more than just one . but , if you're kid who friends all ltto , you want one your own , $30 lot easier save up than $50 . you could say , " well , then get irt-2x . " would also fine , but irt-2x doesn't hud , can't even use one if you one go it , ' cus it doesn't hud port . hud appealing kids actually quite useful game . single player pack also good when someone uneven number members family or group doesn't want spend $20 just extra . i'm not saying it best deal or anything , just it not entirely pointless	1

i thought this would just ticket my 6 year old crafter . wrong ! i spent 15 minutes trying different angles , pressures , speeds , nothing helped . still popped out looking like i tore it out paper . stylus button must pushed hard long anything . must used under adult supervision point could very dangerous . it very fine metal point could just easily perforate skin . both my daughters tried it . six year old spent 10 minutes , me assisting her every other minute because she got so frustrated it trying get it work " right " . she no longer interested using it . my 14 year old tried it , same problems i . she no longer interested . i would give this item zero stars if i could . i doubt this item market very long	-1

well , it christmas day 2006 this present huge disappointment our 6 10 year old , well myself , 39 year old ! photographs show children holding pen angle , way kids normally color draw , however , you hold this vertical paper all times , you move it slow snail order allow holes close enough together so you " cut " . even then , results disappointing . i love draw craft , this " cutter " going back box because both my children hated it . now , i figure out what it . it not even something i would pass anyone else kids , tell you truth . i bought this brand new store , so i doubt it malfunctioning . i read other positive reviews am puzzled because they love it . if you like sitting there moving tool snail pace , getting perforated line , then you probably like using this crayola cutter . if you expect anything more , then you disappointed . my advice would try out friend before you buy .	-1
my children fight over it but alot fun it . thank you	1
bought this my 3 year old because it says 3+ . i decided listen it before giving it her any parent who cares what their preschoolers listen , this product not you . i don't think children her age should listening songs " trouble " boys chasing girls . product itself great idea very easy children age use their own , but my 3 year old no longer using this toy	-1
if you want keep your sanity you not buy this toy ! i read reviews before i bought this my son should taken them heart ! he wanted it so badly . i could used $ this other things ! this so hard but back together once you get it open . it so frustrating . i didn't realize it so many little parts put together keep track once opened . it very loud not sure what sound supposed . i think subway train . it doesn't come batman so all 6 batman we not fit .. my 51/2 year old very disapointed he gets so frustrated when playing this	-1
i two words you ... bat droppings . this definitely worst $50 i ever spent . it flimsy , it doesn't go back together , getting it together took engineering degree . i wish i read up it before buying it .	-1
they so great we need more ! we nice size family even after purchasing this set , my son still needs more order name everyone :) he plays them each day they seem very durable ( we them over month now ) no problems yet he not gently them times either . great addition whether expand pretend play family members , friends , teachers , doctors or whatever names you want give these people	1
my 20-month-old son lot toys , but this one he gone back several times throughout day plays it pretty long stretches , around 30 minutes each time which very long him ! his favorite so far blue room singing playdate . he loves doodleboard roarysaurus pages . he figured out how work everything within 15 minutes . we took it my parents ' house so he would something play while we there everyone curious it . soon my 6-year-old nephew 8-year-old niece huddled up my son front fireplace they all played it together long time . then my brother oldest daughter , who 12 , just see what big deal soon she playing , too ! even adults give it try . it very entertaining everyone , younger kids really engaged it , especially my son . screen dark but lights light up under parts page , you see pretty clearly . i think they could designed it bit better , but my son nor i any trouble seeing correct areas push . each cartridge so many learning opportunities great songs , we plan buy them all , even older ones original player . i am very impressed sensitivity screen . it seems just perfect , unlike reviewer , we haven't any trouble it not giving us correct response when pushing certain picture . my son touch enough make it work but if you accidentally brush your fingers across it while carrying or whatever it won't start singing out blue . far durability goes , my son handling this toy great care because he adores it so much , but it seems very sturdy carrying handle nice . it bit heavy him carry himself yet it larger than i thought it would , but it perfect size him set floor front him play . back unit angled such way so if toy placed floor or your child lap , it better position seeing screen . lastly , sound . it bit loud , even lower setting , but it not enough annoying or me worry it damaging his ears . it always noisy our busy house anyway , so extra volume helps though i would preferred slightly lower setting well quiet times . all all i think it fantastic toy great learning tool . songs catchy memorable easily help remember lesson taught . it great entertainment education same time . highly recommended ! oh , please note player pictured here not plus system , it original . plus player silver color more square shaped than one pictured . we love play record microphone it same price original player , so definitely go plus version if you	1
when visiting her older cousins , my daughter got play this toy , which belonged my 3 year old nephew . he special needs , very hard toys . he would drop it , throw it step it hourly basis . fact it still worked like champ after least 6 months him owning it miracle itself . they sent us one gift my daughter , 13 months , after seeing how much she liked it , she cannot get enough this toy ! i love it durable , literally - she stands it sometimes , it fallen i don't know how many times . it not too big her carry around or manipulate , she figured out how work it immediately . now just listening songs , watching screen rotate making noises into microphone keeps her happy . but her older cousins love educational games cartridges they , really get kick out singing into microphone . cartridges big sturdy , easy child put himself if they old enough . it would nice if microphone cord longer , but i'm guessing it would safety hazard make it longer . teh speaker really loud but some clear packing tape over it muffled it enough our comfort . lower volume control would nice . overall , i've seen it work 13 month old , 3 year old 5 year old . if it broke i would replae it immediately , only one other toy we own gets more mileage	1
excellent product . carry it around conversation piece . however , some might need warned : his visage may drive you insane .	1
i love this game . i bought it my husband , but i love it too . it little challenging learn first , but once you get hang it , it great ! i love fact it lights up low light conditions . it would nice see whole screen once , but overall , great buy	1
this my second big screen freecell purchase . my first one several years old works well . i keep one my car ( bridge lifts ) one house . screen bright enough play game dark . though i play game daily , batteries last several months	1
i old verion radica freecell game 12 months , but wished it lit up dark . hey presto , someone must heard me now my husband even closer divorcing me- ( only joking . he says he won't , providing i keep sound effects turned off ! ) this new upgraded model game superb especially ' low light ' feature . now i antisocial day or night !!! joking aside , cards much easier read , scroll up down buttons far more easy handle than original ' roller ' buttons much bigger which makes chances mistakes fewer . next upgrade , there any chance ' undo last move ' button reduce curse words when i mess up ???	1

bought this my daughter she loved it . so much i eventually hide it periods time moments peace quiet . then without any notice it stopped working after 4 months use . before it stopped working i would given it 4 star rating . 1 star deduction because even though it ability accept power adapter , they not include one . if you don't buy one , you go through quite few batteries . we use rechargeable batteries all our toys , so i chose not buy power adapter it . thankfully , i didn't or i would spent more money now useless lump plastic . ************************ updated after my intial review ... my husband opened product up found it fuse blew . it required someone who knows electronics able diagnose what problem . luckily , we such person our house . we saved item . but i not change my rating because average household probably wouldn't gone through trouble . it required multi-meter , new fuse soldering kit . i wonder how many these keyboards would saved if only they made case so fuse accessable . $3 worth supplies 45 min time , ours now working again	-1

i seen boys girls ages 2 8 captivated uncle milton " moon my room . " adult , frankly i think it pretty cool too ! moon model contured , textured surface . it couple inches thick , curved , so it real depth . moon cycles through 12 different phases . i not seen any evidence light turning automatically after dark , advertised , but it works fine manually or activating automatic 5-seconds per phase cycle . moon lit up light within plastic not glow dark when it turned off . moon my room advertised appropriate ages 6 up , but since it mounted wall i don't see why it can't go toddler room long remote control secured . i echo previous reviewer comment you need keep track remote , i don't think it would work otherwise	1
just like what advertized . i teach high school it mounted my cinder block wall . it moves demos moon phases well . fun all ages . i would recommend it one all	1

blade cpp good , responsive heli attractive price . this only my third model helicopter , so i added training gear flat-bottomed rotors soften it bit help protect it my goofs . i've flying mine couple weeks now i really enjoy added precision outdoor performance compared fixed-pitch helis same price range . heli very lightly built carbon fiber , aluminum reinforced plastic bits . you preflight it when you get it make sure everything tight , but that just proper procedure . mine came out box balanced adjusted almost perfectly , very pleasant experience . there lot upgrade parts available blade if you want go way , but stock setup pretty good . i suggest getting extra battery pack , since they take 1.5 hr charge i hate waiting . other worthwhile upgrades include stronger motors heading-lock gyro , but those may not helpful you until you've gained some experience start trying more advanced maneuvers . flight stability medium , since it aerobatic bird . priority this heli seems responsiveness maneuverability . it reacts immediately control inputs not take well overcontrolling , so hovering challenge learn . once you're comfortable quick response , it easy fly , but it takes practice get there . this not beginner heli without help unless you're unusually quick learner . if you haven't flown rc helicopters before just take it out zoom into air , you crash , probably lot . if you're still considering this starter , you should get simulator like excellent realflight 3.5 practice before you try real thing ( you save much more than cost simulator repair parts you didn't buy ) . you'll better off still if you look rc flying club your area so you mix talk others who help you start off .	1

this 2nd biggest set duplo bob builder series , but it seems most pleasing playwise , it comes building opening windows door , table chairs , bob , his cat , travis . it also comes trailer put house , it towed travis . while scoop lofty set two vehicles it , buildings not build up much anything , so you would just end up more loose blocks around house ( big set 80+ pieces ) . i couldn't justify spending extra money it either . i recommend this one best series . my son loves these sets , but he also thomas duplos tends spend more time playing those .	1

it not easy find swing tree 3-4 year old ! it took me lot searching find this swing , so even though it wasn't long enough , we rigged more strong rope top got it work . it nice design works fine . it fairly easy set up use it pretty . once swing attached tree , you adujust length rope goes througth lady bugs side . we didn't want get whole swing set , so it very hard find just wooden swing ( net stores ) so we decided buy it since making one would cost same taken lot more time ! i recommend this ages 3 up . it great way swing tree ... stay low or go really high ! nothing beats swing shade ! -suzann	1
i mixed feelings this item . my daughter loves car . it work but there one piece garage tendancy fall off . it piece holds front bumper garage magnets . there twist tie it when i opened package but i took it off ( because that what you twist ties childrens products ) . over all it works it cheap so i really can't complain . magazine rack uses little pieces card board magazines ... those all torn off my daughter	1
i buy it producto becouse very cheap free shipping i baby 23 month	1
i recently bought this pool my 3 year old grandson . he loves it ! it just right size so he splash around not worry keeping his head above water . while it not large pool diameter , example 2 3 toddlers only , ease set up , durability price plus . fact i am going buy one so he one his home .	1
i purchased this pool my five year old son . he placed pool end his slide slides down into pool . pool very durable . there shouldn't any complaints this one it really great product .	1
my parents bought this pool big summer party they , ton kids used it ( i'd estimate 20 kids , mostly under 7 years , out it all day ) . then i took it home set up my daughter 5th birthday , which saw 8 kids jumping , swimming spalshing it . we've used it daily since then ( all summer ) . it small pin-hole after first use probably happened moving it our house ( back truck ) , but easily patched clear liquid nails . we haven't any trouble deflating , collapsing , leaking , etc . since then . it pain drain water because weight full pool keeps water getting out small drain hole bottom ( we've tried grass driveway - even overnight thing still full ) . i let air out top 2 rings get water out . but we bought large bicyle-type pump ( pool section toysrus ) which works ok - air compressor would better . it get dirty - particularly our hard water . so even cover chlorine i dump water every few days . it would nice filter , but then again - it only $30 pool . i give kids butterfly net them get grass out when they playing pool . kids absolutely love it ( i 3 obnoxious little monsters , 3 , 5 7 years ) they give it pretty strenuous workout every day . it held up well hopefully still useable next year . really hot days , i even get them , i see why they love it . they really swim it , rather than " wade " like they little plastic one . it won't compare easy-set type pools filters etc ., but it great kiddie-pool . i plan this pool or one like it least few more years	1
there little assembly required , but nothing too hard . you just need hammer , pliers flat head screwdriver . radioflyer logos sides stickers you place yourself . my 20 month old loves put his toys this wagon pull them around . it fairly light so if you child likes throw things , you might find this flying through air . other than , it quite durable . it more likely cause damage what it hits than itself . also if you particularly tall toddler , handle may little short . it 13 " floor it tallest	1
my daughter got this christmas loves spin ball round round , only complaint i it letters little tough toddlers push .. so all she hears abc song over over ... i push letters so she hear sound alphabet .. but overall it great toy she still continues play it .	1

i find this set just little more than my 14 month old use right now . although he loves all pieces , he doesn't understand reindeer pull sleigh houses little light-weight doors little too small really easy him use . i think this big hit next christmas season . oh , ours came " hard-t o-o pen " package ( i hate those ) , not white box .	1

if you need few curves pinch , this decent set . only reason i give it 4 stars there better " road pack " set out there . i highly recommend getting beginner roadway expansion pack ( http://www.amazon.com/learning-curve-thomas-friends-railway/dp/b000062sqm ) . if you math , buying two these sets ( which you'll need , trust me ) verses one beginner roadway expansion : $7 dollars you get few straight track more imporantly , train/road cross piece ( which only available few other track/road sets ) . if you don't bertie , beginner roadway expansion better deal ( if you bertie , either use it spare bertie or give bertie someone else xmas) !	1

this game so fun !!! i played it whole lot back when it first came out 10 years ago . wore out cards ! it best 5 8 people , so it not one you'll just playing your sweetheart , but it absolutely blast when you 5 or more . it simple - very simple . luck required but little ( little ! ) bit strategy comes into it too . rounds over very quickly - probably 5 minute rounds , seating order changes each round based who goes out first . go out first you're " great dalmuti " next round . take your choice best chair , make everybody pay you tribute ! especially " great peon ! " ( last person go out last round ) . we would always play up role higher lower classes , peons not allowed talk directly dalmuti , etc . ( it more fun way ) awesome party game or great family game if you enough people	1

i bought this set my 10 year old daughter she loves it . planets easy snap together there plenty paint . my favorite feature glow dark paint . it painted after regular paint dries , or you mix it colored paint different effect . it didn't glow bright i'd hoped , but wasn't big deal . paint dried surprisingly fast , we able apply two coats colored paint glow dark stuff under two hours . i would recommend using smaller paintbrush than one included . we used q-tip details . sun saturn come plastic rings , there even poster solar system . mobile pretty easy put together , instructions very clear , my daughter most it herself . we it hanging ceiling my daughter room , so no one touch it . when we hanging it up , i accidentally scratched pluto some paint came off . overall this great toy . i would recommend this toy older children . i can't see five year old painting details little planets putting together mobile	1

this toy took " santa " hours put together it falling apart within 24hr . period . we ended up throwing it away	-1
my favorite part building this thing when parts actaully popped off base becuase they didnt fit where they should . i made it all way 2nd floor , then when trying connect 2nd floor 1st floor every part ended up falling apart . luckily i found it buyout place $10 ( i plan returning it ) , i cant imagine spending $30-40 bucks this ! if you dont kids ( mine 4 year old ) plenty glue/tape/frosting/termite spit then i supose you could eventually make good looking batcave keep top shelf away small children , house pets sudden bursts air	-1

we got this our son first christmas when he 10 months old . first he just like shapes when they out table ... they rattle . it wasn't until 14 months old he started understand concept hitting them through table hammer . now 17 months old it one his favorites . string hammer could just little longer ... it lined up just perfect order enough room hit shapes . also sides could little taller so shape actually fell through other side when it sitting floor . normally my son wants me hold it while he hits so he push shapes all way through . overall we really like this toy i'm always excited find basic non-battery skill teaching toy . we recite colors while playing this some shapes ... although some hard really name . oh my son thinks any toy you hit great ... definate bonus .	1

i purchased this toy my daughter when she 16 months old . i hoping it'd similar bumble balls they used make early 90s , but it not . while my daughter found it interesting liked toy , it much heavier than i anticipated . children like throw drop things , i not recommend this toy . i constantly worried she would drop it her toes or my toes . when it crash ground , it made horrible loud noise . i am amazed it not break ( so it seem durable least ) not seem damage my floors . i ended up dubbing it " cannon ball " quietly disposed it some months later when my daughter seemed less interested it	1

i recently purchased this laser tag set my nephews : 6 years old 8 years old . i couldn't believe how complicated they made this classic game ! there least 10 buttons gun : trigger , shields , ammo reload , " option " , sound on/off , indoor/outdoor , " 2nd " ?, like 5 others underneath lcd screen . all i wanted put batteries this thing watch my cousins shoot each other . instead i spend 15 minutes reading instruction manual . there no off switch either me reset game start over ( follow instructions ) . youngest getting frustrated because he holding down reload button which wouldn't let him fire . he actually crying saying , " this doesn't work ! " . all i wanted simple classic laser tag my childhood : turn shoot . not say this game isn't fun older kids . my opinion , though , hasbro gone way overboard ruined perfectly good game	1

settlers catan fantastic game , it would seem board game world means sequel inevitable . so , eventually seafarers catan ( kosmos mayfair games , 1997 - klaus teuber ) released . it fitting expansion , so simple add-on rules , i almost always include it base game . game offers very few more choices expansion included , amount scenarios included book excellent ; some them truly fun ! seafarers expansion adds number things base game , including ... 1 . ) gold fields : these basically " wild " hexes produce whatever resource player wants if they settlement or city bordering them . this makes gold fields very valuable , everyone wanting piece action . scenarios counter this putting gold fields hard reach places , less than optimal number them , like " 3 " . still , it doesn't stop me trying get them ! 2 . ) water hexes : well adding some additional hexes each five resources ( gold hexes ) , twelve water hexes added game . when combined fourteen edge pieces hold all hexes together , one create many maps - many more than one island . when using water hexes , players usually start their first two settlements one island , then must expand other islands . edge pieces hold board together large rectangle , keeping tiles sliding around table . cities knights also comes frame ; but it more hexagonal one , allowing only setup basic game - so i prefer seafarers one more . 3 . ) ships : players expand seas ship pieces . each player receives fifteen ship pieces their color beginning game . ships cost one wool one lumber build ( this raises value wool ) . ships placed two water hexes act similar roads . fact , longest road ( now called longest trade route ) now includes ships well roads . first ship must built next settlement shore , then placed adjacent other ships . ships also move , if they last ship " open " shipping lane ( not connect two cities ) . players may move one ship per turn , location they could built . this makes ships sound more exciting than they really - reality , they aren't moved often . but either way , ships big improvement , they only way get other islands . players allowed start ship instead road if one their starting settlements coastline . ships crux game ( why it called " seafarers " ) ; while they don't add much terms complexity , they add one more option players explore make games more interesting . 4 . ) special victory points : some scenarios award special victory points - tokens included game . many times this occurs when player lands new island . this allows scenario dictate change strategy bit variety game . 5 . ) pirate ship : pirate ship added game counterpoint robber . whenever player rolls " 7 " , they may move pirate ship instead robber , placing pirate any ocean hex . player then steal one resource one players who ship adjacent hex . new ships can't placed next pirate , giving even more reason move him . either way , it seems robber moved lot less games involving pirate . this actually increases power robber , game get slightly nastier . if robber stifling production your best cities/settlements dozens turns , it get rather annoying . players must think even more carefully when moving robber/pirate , soldier cards become much more useful . 6 . ) scenarios : there eleven scenarios included book , some them rather good , others good maybe one play or two . either way , if player would get tired these scenarios , there plenty more available internet . first scenario , " new shores " , played many times , it basically generic setup seafarers . last two scenarios require multiple sets basic settlers , so i'm not sure how often they'll come into play . seafarers offers lot variety settlers without adding very many rules - probably best epitaph expansion . i won't say it necessary ; indeed , one play settlers many times without expansion never miss it . but i doubt you would return basic settlers after trying seafarers - especially when you see variety it includes . i'm certainly glad i picked expansion up ; settlers fans enjoy it greatly . tom vasel " real men play board games . " ( ...	1

before i decided purchase this item my children , i what i always : jump amazon.com check out reviews . my surprise , there weren't any . so , i hopped over leapfrog.com view synopsis . leapfrog doesn't even list this game available title their site . next , i google search try find review this title i directed sega website . i clicked link sonic game directed , suprisingly enough , back leapfrog website , where no results found . talk hitting brick wall ... so , i took chance i bought it my 4 1/2 year-old son add his ever-growing collection leapster titles . it hit . both he my daughter love it . they actually played sonic game last night instead wii which they playing daily since christmas . we actually pry leapster out my son hands just get him into bed . game , i my reservations since this game seems produced sega opposed leapfrog ; so i wasn't sure if it would same educational themes most leapfrog games . while theme this game much more video game based than most leapfrog games , it also very educational . not played any sonic game titles seem so popular , i only compare it games i am familiar . graphics remind me little bit super mario brothers , some challenges seem follow similar themes . also , game set up into different zones , which each different activity . example , one activities game teaches addition you add blocks top screen . once you think you answer , you find it board while taking care avoid wrong answers . activities teaches your child how count backward following sequence top screen , then racing find next number . all while , you collect little gold rings each stage game which added top screen . some stages timed , so you can't take too long figure out answer . there also activities teach number sequencing subtraction . each activity three different skill levels choose . target age this product listed kindergarten 1st grade . i bought it my 4 1/2 year-old he doing very well it , but he much stronger math than reading writing . i think this great game preschool kindergarten aged children help reinforce number recognition , counting simple math concepts very fun way . frame reference , my son also enjoys following leapster titles : counting zero , mr. pencil , learning leap , letters loose , mole huge nose , cars , letter factory , kindergarten , spongebob cars . if your child similar interests , he or she most likely enjoy this game . if you looking reinforce your child mathematical concepts , i recommend this game or counting zero . update : leapfrog updated their website past few days least show this title , although it listed " coming soon " . hope this helps .	1

this good addition our son duplo/quatro/lego sets , letting him integrate two fun bob builder characters into his building repertoire . reviewer noted , there aren't enough other blocks much this set alone . it , however , offer some dynamic play , such combining scoop lofty parts into elongated dual-action vehicle ( scoop front , crane back , etc . ) , well integrating some action pieces into buildings ( crane , example , could stationary building rather than vehicle , vehicle base allows expanded use other block sets even if scoopy lofty parts aren't used .	1

wonderful item bought off amazon , [ ... ] ok onto item itself . it wasent hard put together but easier two people . price wheel cover some other parts plastic , they should metal instead just main frame handles durability . back tires plastic like what you would find 3 wheel hot wheel . which good skidding out but if it used alot wont hold up long not very thick . fun factor , son love it so i give it thumbs up . far educational , really its not meant but help tune coordination . overall it worth its weight gold if your kid loves it , plus frame limited lifetime warranty	1

i must admit i've skeptical leapfrog claims their products educational . my son enjoys his leappad , it certainly entertains him , but i've wondered if he actually learned anything . tad great day letter factory changed my view . first time i popped it reader , we sat worked it nearly hour . i couldn't believe it ! my son typically spends 15 20 minutes working leappad book , so this shocking me . then , characteristically he wanted it again . presently , my son owns 12 leappad books . tad great day letter factory his current favorite , it receives lot attention . he loves trace letters , especially letter " i " because it " i , i , i , icky ..., " " because it goes , , , yeah ! " activities fun preschoolers , william enjoys silly sayings , interactive play . mazes challenging too . example , final maze asks you pick up letter(s ) deliver them specific location . activity requires children listen instructions , find recognize letter(s ) , follow path deliver them . it offers praise way , which preschoolers appreciate . william recently started asking questions words . instance , other day he asked if word " car " started " , " or " " because it " , , " sound . last night he told me his pizza , , , hot like letter " . " i think interactive play , focus phonics leappad reading writing books making difference his comprehension . two things consider before purchasing writing book : firstly , don't leave preschooler unattended pencil , second , let them practice two , or three times before you erase pages . i learned hard way my son , pencil dangerous combination . after william got hang book i stepped out room unload dishwasher , when i came back there all sorts scribbling marks pages . magic pencil automatically feeds when lead gets low , but you tap it couple times it work . this frustrates my son , he'll start banging darn thing , scrawling get it work . it trick , but makes horrible mess . also , plan spend least 30-minutes erasing pages this book . i keep eraser out my son reach , because every time he sees it , he wants use it . pages crinkle , they tear off binding too much friction . my only gripe tad great day letter factory , short all erasing , it only features upper case letters . you purchase kindergarten book work both upper , lower case letters , so if your child already practicing his letters i recommend kindergarten book instead . overall , it very helpful , i believe my son actually learning this book .	1
i got my first k'nex set my kids ( well , myself well ) when my son 4 . k'nex allows kids make innumerable constructs . enclosed book gets their imagination flowing , additional instructions web site further enhance , but then kids let loose their own ideas . my son now 11 my daughter 8 they still coming up new imaginative creations . k'nex not intricate detail lego . however , long rods , connecting pieces , allow construction sturdy models ( long bridges/tall buildings ) pieces generic enough they reused over over different purposes . its great	1
these guns great ! we purchased one each our boys . balls not hurt , they not hit hard enough break things house , gun not require batteries , simple easy use . i think everyone family played some time . worth money	1
gotta love different types rubber duckies hitting market nowadays . i gotta love accroutrements unique take classic bath tub toy , rubber duckie . one my personal favorite rubber duckies i own dead rubber duckie . it too cute too funny . this dead duckie should own anyone who into goth culture . dead duckie slightly smaller its devil duckie cousins . i like drop blood hangs below his lip crossed out eyes . this must rubber duckie collectors . it nice contrast its yellow cousins	1
this great game ! dvds really make it come alive . i couldn't imagine this game without music , images , film clips , other various forms dynamism dvds . game great fun teach most people great deal star wars . word caution order , though . if you would never call yourself " star wars fan , " then you probably able answer only handful questions during any particular game . fact , even most " diehard " fans likely find few questions leave them scratching their heads .	1
there nothing like getting together fellow star wars fans play this special version trivial pursuit . it great ! it just like old trivial pursuit , course , questions only star wars . when you try wedge , however , you resort one two dvds come game question . if you don't answer question time limit given , your oponents shout out right answer - long they don't wedge - possibly steal it you . if you like classic trivial pursuit you happen star wars fan you couple like-minded friends or family members , this lot fun definitely worth money	1
this product horrible !!!!! i send first one back because it broke second day my child it . it took several weeks us get new one when it finally come it broke after three days use .	-1
my mom gave me this game i am finding it very hard put down . it very fun addictive . i no instructions but it very easy figure out . this great take you anywhere you might wait ( makes time fly ) . i too , wish it lighted but i still love it	1
one hand held yahtzee game plus time play winning combination . it seems i belong select group folks who can't stop playing electronic hand held yahtzee game ! i enjoyed it immensely , but beware , once you start playing it hard put down ! yahtzee great passing time anywhere . it same setup regular yahtzee . you get three tries score before you select where put your total . lots fun trying beat highest score previous games played . fun play while waiting trains , boats , or doctor appointments . we one car even bathroom . only trouble it it hard stop playing ! great game , great fun . ~ mrs. .	1
when you're playing this easy carry hand help game , you'll amazed how hour or two slip unnoticed . perfectly honest , i wasn't ever big fan traditional yahtzee game , so when i received this little electronic version christmas , i only mildly amused . then i began playing . not only i pick it up nearly every free second i , but my roommate steals it away when she . it fairly simple learn rules figure out strategy . after , it hours frustrating excitment	1
old favorite when my kids young - easily learned , but challenging strategies must developed . plenty stimulus agressive-minded who like thwart their opponents . fun adults well children	1
very easy 7-year-old operate , indoors outdoors . fun play more so if you 2 them . sturdy construction	1
great fun play old game old dog new fun way , especially appeals kids under 40	1
my mom i playing this game every night this week after i fished it out closet ( she bought it us few christmases ago , but it went largely ignored , because my brother reluctant play ) . though one-on-one isn't much fun group game , we fun because we're almost evenly matched . she 56 her years knowledge her side , watches lot television , quite good pink , yellow , blue categories . she also travel agent , so her knowledge geography quite sharp ... but she abysmal guesser . if she doesn't know answer , more often than not , she'll throw down silliest thing you've ever heard , answer defies even most basic logic . other hand , i'm 18 disadvantage either not born or toddler through half 20 years this game covers . but i working knowledge modern pop culture news , am good green , yellow , blue categories , -- truth told -- am probably bit smarter than mom . she hasn't beaten me yet , but our past several games extremely close ! half fun game inevitable jokes spring it ... we invented our own trivial pursuit term " michael dukakis " recurring person , place , or thing keeps popping up questions answers throughout game , because during our first game , michael dukakis just wouldn't leave me alone ( it seemed like ) every card i given ( even now , when michael dukakis mentioned question or answer , we burst into laughter ) . i wish we could delete orange category , because i know next nothing sports , mom only slightly better . brown category also haunts us , but i am fluent comics , so i advantage there . no matter what , you'll probably missing lot questions , so just prepared ( my games played two very intelligent people , so i imagine situation worse among those less trivia prowess ) . but we've ton fun , , perhaps , maybe you , too	1
game still fun , but many questions so incredibly inane no one would ever know them . who really knows who wrote default ditty plays when microsoft windows boots up ? board low quality flimsy ; it won't even lay flat table , so dice don't stay it well . reviewer implied only uneducated people would think questions too hard , but my husband i both finishing out master degrees emory , we both found game boring frustrating	-1
molded plastic not stay kid shoulders soon my grandson raises his arms if fly , cape drops down his back shield pulls against his neck chokes him . i am so disappointed . he would love it otherwise but not wear it because it painful . not waste your money	-1
my 16 month old daughter loves little people play sets . toys perfect size little hands imaginations . she plays these items every day her 11 year old brother ! ( who decides age range these anyway ? )	1
we bought this our 2 daughters . yes , there little tiny pieces yes , it take long time put these all up . however , end result so great . there enough stars cover ceiling walls so it really feel like you out under stars . sticker pieces don't hold glow long plastic pieces but whole effect room wonderful . it lasts least hour . i similar set my son room when he younger . set didn't glow nearly long these stars . now bedtime , we all head into girls room enjoy effect	1
when sticking stars up ceiling , don't use putty provided , heat makes them fall down within few days . so instead use hot glue gun silicon it doesn't ruin your stars or ceiling paint they wont fall off ... thats what i used start previous experience .	1
i bought this item jsut 2 years ago thinking it cool e-mail things but no only well math htings like it very good laptop learning if you check your e-mail you would hook this wire computer no reason just use computer ( ...	-1
i just got vohrak he rocks !!! way beat him hit his head down kraata pop out	1
this rahkshi one my fovorites . i like this one because vohrak very fun play , he immitate just every human position . his back he carries kraata pop out pushing his head down holder , holder case pop open , kratta fly out it . his knees bend , his legs , his arms , also his head move around too . sometimes you may too ajust his legs feet him stay up , but he stands up prety well . his arms also move side side up down . vohrak also folded up certain way stored his container he came . he also combined two other rahkshi , panrahk guurahk	1
if you like scrabble , you love this game . this present my daughter she loves it ! fact , she usually beats me . if you looking fun or exciting challenge , this game great	1
i used this game my son when he 5 we would spell words then going upwards we could change word such " bat " " cat " etc . he would come up endless changes really got understand his phonics well improve his spelling reading skills . if you child just getting hang phonics this encourage your child learn while fun mom or dad .	1

my husband i bought this garage sale $3 friend . i'd furious if i bought this store . we both musicians it kills our ears everytime man sings there . my child loves playing it but it probably tossed out door everyone sanity .	-1
my son this toy couple months , he 1 now , he definately hasnt gotten tired it ! he just loves any toy plays music , he loves animal noises . this toy it all him ! he gets so happy when music goes he starts clapping bounce dancing , very cute ! good things : -there lots different songs noises phrases ( each thing you push 3 different things ) so i havent gotten annoyed it ... yet course . -you push each animal while song playing remainder song sung " moos " " oinks " or " baas " ( so cute ! ) , roll duck thing song speed up . -the keyboard 5 big keys say numbers , colors , or play music . -the storyboard two songs seperated plastic page easy little ones turn back forth . -the sun top toy lights up when anything going , also rocked back forth start new song . -there volume control - very good . -this toy not too big not too small , takes normal aa batteries . things not so good ? : -i see how fingers might get wegded under pig , but this hasnt happened my little explorer ; or if it he figured out pull his hand out without fussing , it easy he smart boy . -the toy start sing itself if left alone minute , which good or bad . it stops after little while if not touched . -the singer off-key every now then , but come it baby toy ! unless you're training your baby 9 months become next american idol , it perfectly fine ! bottom line : one best toys i've ever seen it keeps my baby busy learning dancing	1
friend bought this our 7-month-old daghter she loves it . i see this quickly becoming her favorite toy . she loves keyboards toys respond pushes pokes , but most toys this type we own switches buttons too stiff her manipulate . she hasn't built up strength play these toys yet , but vtech farm different . all buttons knobs easy move so she play it easily . it clearly designed help her develop fine motor skills i see her developing these skills this toy already . she figured out pulling pushing dog get it make noises banging keys get them play notes . i expect her discover other way play this soon . only part toy i don't like generic look all animals . dog looks like cow which looks like pig . i would prefer it if animals looked less cartoonish more distinguishable so my daughter associate them their names toy talks her . reviewer mentioned his daughter got her hand caught under pig few times , so this something we watch out . one note " actor " providing sound bites : he can't sing ! other reviews mentioned it , but my wife i don't find it annoying ... just hilarious ! right now , i think we get more entertainment this toy than our daughter while we laugh this poor sap struggle through " mary little lamb " . it seems obvious some manager or executive vtech decided save few bucks figured he could all sound bites himself . results get you rolling aisles . if you happen see this display local toy store , pause minute laugh it ( you turn it play it while it still packaging ) .	1
you really can't go wrong geotrax . we've collecting sets two years now old sets get just much play new ones . i two boys ages three six so geotrax really get workout . they easy enough them put together themselves . not one piece track broken we're talking two rough-and-tumble boys using them . variety you all different sets great too . one my boys likes trains other likes construction vehicles , so they each their favs . battery life great too . we use rechargable batteries recharge once week daily use . i just can't say enough great things geotrax . keep'em coming	1
this good addition geotrax collection but i would make sure you high chimes clock tower your collection first . clock tower also motion sensor sounds . it also ability accomodate different elevations ( opens up great world building possibilities ! ) unlike rocky falls tunnel . final reason i would go item first it probably discontinued first so get it while you . :) rocky falls ' tunnel pretty nifty . i wish there way choose which soundtrack gets played or least way just turn nature sounds . since you turn wheel your own ( rather than relying geomotion ) it would just cool if you could operate water sounds go it . building seems bit limited this item . you either choose forgo using whole tunnel or you build train large enough accomodate crossroad . not big deal , just something plan around . finally , we bought 2 these this week . first one lubricant like film over one pieces ( one houses main unit , one battery compartment ) . i contacted f.p. they said it not normal . ( i didn't think it ! ) . so , we shipping it back them exchange $20 voucher . they no replacement items stock so we just bought new one . it residue free . just wanted make note this case it happens someone else . geotrax awesome this good addition your collection . just make sure you buy older items first ! you don't want search discontinued item they showing product inserts or box . :	1

lego 2006 technic lineup features vehicles not only fun play , but also recreating technical aspects today construction material handling industries . telehandler no exception . $30 us you get build not only telehandler , but also front-end loader . both models feature rear-wheel steering very realistic functions similar machines they replicating . main model this set front bucket not only raises up down tilts , but also telescopes out quite far . i realize lot technic enthusiasts aren't crazy integration smooth liftarms instead traditional studded beams , but many models created last few years look much more life-like smooth , curved liftarms . all all , good value your money	1
i bought 2 these lamps . one each daughter . they loud vibrate/move around little table . medrmaids other items inside would not float around water . i threw both lamps away but kept miniature mermaids . girls play them bathtub but unfortunately , mermaids so small we lost few down drain	-1
yes , this lamp make humming water noise similar fish tank ... but how you expect less product filled water ? we use it bed time well during day . very cute swimming polly pockets well fish ect included . you change color reflected bottom . water ( even dry heat ) not evaperate quickly . i give this lil tank a+ .	1
this toy wonderful , very similar block patterns my childhood . my children ( ages 5 , 3 , 1 ) all loved it , older two building designs , younger " helping " . i would definetly recommend toy it fun educational many ages- something important our house . however , if you lots blocks your house , these blocks ( which needed designs ) lost mixed up your other blocks . we labeled blocks , which made keeping them separate possible , but unless you strict policy not combining toys your house ( not much fun this toy ) prepared some blocks find their way somewhere else , thereby making it impossible use patterns .	1
my son smitten ariel ever since we got back disney world last summer . so i bought him this set christmas he thrilled . figurines include ariel , prince eric , max ( eric dog ) , sebastian , flounder , king triton , ursula . my son made diorama underwater scene christmas day -- complete characters ! -- while my artistic husband crafted ship out cardboard . he affixed ship top diorama , placing prince eric ( telescope ) crow nest while max deck . if your little one ( or even " big one " ! ) fan little mermaid , they'll entranced attractive package figurines this set .	1
my son owned previous version this " garbage " truck 2 years . his orange but other than it looks same , so i hope this review still relevant . what i would like say when we bring this truck park other children flock around it . noises it makes sound real , lever arms dumping always please . it thrashed lots kids still soldiers . educational value comes seeing how those big dumpster-collecting trucks work . i'm not certain , but this truck seems accurate depiction . addition here good part , this truck lived backyard year now rained months . however , it still works ! i thought sure batteries would corroded but they weren't . long live orange " garbage " truck !	1
better than i expected - big hit - packaged shipped great	1

i highly recomend this webkinz koala everybody who webkinz . it comes wacky eucalyptus television . get koala	1
object game basically simple . read one songs card based where you landed board try hum and/or use charades so your team guess song . it what it , if this sounds fun , then there no reason you won't like it . problem songs contained within , while varied , mostly pretty old . even those contemporary category go back 1970s . i'm 24 years old could only recognize 15% songs , rendering game unplayable me . theory you pantomime title even if you don't know song , but it difficult this songs like " hey , jude " " theme mash . " my parents grandparents otherhand recognized nearly everything . this would great them , but not me . so i write this informative review so you'll know what kinds songs you'll getting . this really isn't game kids or young adults going able play .	1
my son wanted electronic baseball christmas , however , after reading many reviews amazon.com i convinced it bad product . i came across front porch games circa baseball thought it looked like one arcade games my husband son enjoyed . i not disappointed . took us some time get homeruns figured out but now we it great . what i also like we leave it out coffee table decorative piece everyone who comes over can't resist it take few swings . i would suggest this product anyone whose looking some good clean family fun	1
i ordered this because i liked look , thought it would neat addition my game collection . my delight , it also turns out great fun ! it basically pinball style game , but even without electronics all , it joy play . friend who wants play ? it easy follow basic baseball rules play through nine innings . swing bat get single , double , triple , home run , or even get out ! much like real baseball , you'll work get some points board . added bonus , this game easy assemble beautiful behold . it stays out nicely , decorative piece your game room or addition any sports memorabilia collection . i'm not even sports fan , i love this game . it good return simple fun , value added craftsmanship	1

despite reviewer warning , i ordered faucet light . or without " adapter " , this light would not fit any faucets my home .	-1
i love horses . i 2 them . so i naturally attracted this glamerous doll . i read review girl did`nt get accesories . i don`t this doll so i don`t know . she her own story one . she nice style riding horses her boots her shoes look nice . it does`nt look wierd like brats flimsy hats . ( whitch suppossed collectibles way . ) i don`t know horses , but i think they could go anyone . conclusion , i think this doll well worth your money . it`s not much either . 7.00 some odd change really good price doll	1

alrighty . firstly , i enjoy both barbie bratz seies dolls . they both thier pros cons ... get over it , but both flaws ! anyway ... barbie copieing bratz , yes they , but bratz also copies barbie . example this : barbie first released swapping heads : my scene dolls . then bratz followed ... all toy manufacturing companies copy each other ideas make money . that right all ! bratz pain remove box : yes . they . but they not glued place , they tied place . if you not mind ripping box or cutting it , it easy enough . however , if you wish keep it all intact , it pain time consuming . now stop this nonsense , enjoy your dolls	1

ds started sitting bebepod when he 8 weeks old , soon he could support his own head . age , all his other " seats " ( swing , high chair , car seat , stroller , etc ) him semi-reclining position , where he resting back his head ( , " back sleep " campaign prevent sids , contributes prevalence " flat head " many babies today ) . before baby able sit up himself , aside us holding him up or his relatively brief tummy times , this best ( only ) way him upright his own ! there really nothing else like it market . he loved freedom able turn his head upper body around interact his arms . he sat it play , eat , watch tv , or just hang out us . he really loved sitting independently , like big boy ! we bought both bumbo bebepod , since we couldn't decide which get initially , we used one upstairs one downstairs . honest , they really very similar , except bebepod more aesthetically pleasing . its styling pretty pastel colors much nicer than bumbo loud ugly colors . both made low-density foam , which looks smooth like plastic but feels soft comfortable touch . both lightweight easily wipes clean . it great seat take you park , beach , or grandma house . bumbo seat designed so baby butt dips further down quite bit further seat than his legs . , arm rests , seem support him better when he small ( around 8-14 weeks ) . however , after he grew bigger , bebepod seems bit more comfortable him , since his bottom isn't dipped down low it maintains his posture better . without arm rests , his arms able reach his toys more easily bebepod . also , he likes rest his hands or his toys center pommel bebepod , where his toys often fall off when he bumbo . ( our pommel seems very secure , we not experience other reviewers ' complaints it coming off . ) note : this not chair which you should leave your child unattended . since it not any buckles , it possible child wiggle himself out seat arching his back once he little older . we usually keep seat carpet , so he stays safe even if he manage get himself out it . ( it only happened once when he 6 months old . ds 8.5 months old now . ) sometimes , we place seat table or chair order feed him , but then he always closely monitored . update : ds now 11-months old . after he became adept sitting his own , unsupported , bebepod bumbo no longer necessary . he liked crawl stand , so confining nature these infant seats no longer appropriate . however , we're still happy our purchase . seats served their purpose we keep them next baby . summary , this great infant seat , which we would definitely purchase again . however , before you make your decision , realize usage it may limited approximately 6 months or so , depending your child .	1

this absolutely best pull toy ever ! my daughter given several others , but she loved this one best . she fascinated how he moves his arms up down plays xlyophone . i think because she could see how music played instead just some electrical sounds coming out it like they other pull toys .	1

i bought this unit after post-christmas toys began take over my 2-year old room . whe it arrived , i really disappointed its size ! yes , i'd checked out specifications web before ordering , knew it wasn't ' full-size ' ... but really , thing tiny ! this would really great piece very small children learn how put away their toys , individual bins help keep things organized . but , it horribly unsturdy tykes just learning stand still leaning furniture . if little tikes going ' toddler-size ' angle , they need re-think narrow base make it more stable . or , if it meant used independently pre-schoolers , it should larger , accommodate their growing toys bodies . only other complaint i smell - ' fabric ' bins came out package incredibly strong smell factory - bit like burning hair or plastic ... it so awful , i air our entire unit day porch before putting it my son room ... i've never , ever problem new item smelling bad like before . we've now owned this unit 3 months , i enjoy able let ' everything it place ' my son room . i also love traditional , bright colors - they're fun , but not too juvenile , go any changes i make room decor my son moves toddler preschool phase . i also very pleased strength shelves - we some pretty heavy toys stacked top shelf while keep them out my son reach , it held up just fine . all , i'd recommend this product parents new babies , it really meant very small children - just make sure they don't try pull up it	1
i bought this my 3 daughters they absolutely love it . rod actually casts bobber bait so i don't cast them . i no longer take hook out my pant legs . because it shoots bobber/bait straight out you them fish close bushes such where they would not normally able cast . i think this winner anything keeps my kids happy content while spending time me great product my book	1

ultimate challenge spatial relations try out this game . it like three dimensional tangram it really tough . great time bring this party work solutions group . personally , i think 8 years old probably little young this game . i'd suggest 12+ unless children teamed up adult	1
i really like this toy my daughter too . however , when i unpacked it , it reeked ( continues so ) high heaven sickly sweet baby powder smell . i guess babies ' supposed ' smell like makers this product . so , besides , it great . but , if you any sensitivity ultra strong stinky smells , better not get it . i would encourage manufacturer this doll drop baby powder smell	1
if you looking great value , get this engine . it so cute - it lights up makes chugging sound when it rolling track . we attach it battery-operated engine it makes sounds while other engine provides power . it just hours fun adds extra " something " your train	1

we received our blaster promptly enjoyed it fun way play marshmallows . it works well shoots marshmallows far . it provides good laugh my kids enjoy playing it .	1
i bought one marshmallow shooters , same company not too long ago . it best 20 dollars i've ever spent . acctually , i ended up ordering one my dad , one my 21 year old brother , one sixty something year old guy i work . we even took marshmallow guns my video camera out shot pretty good movie them . my review exact opposite other person who commented shooter . ( they detailed cleaning directions because young children don't know marshmallows melt inside gun hot sun , thus big mess gun . ) house not home out marshmallow gun . i'm purchase my 5th one , i can'wait marshmallow bow arrow	1
excellent kids adults well . we hada great time playing same . see who could get best highest score . what great you just plug same your vcr or tv inputs . i am goingto order several more . it much fun . iam 63years age enjoyed same	1
includes pole position , xevious , rally , bosconian , galaga , mappy . plus , naturally , ms pac man . this much better rendition than other ms pacman stick twitchy controller . left right movement doesn't seem much issue now . really great thing it saves your high scores name , you erase them all later if you wish clear memory . almost all games tweaked better than other joystick version just look , sound , play little better . control pole position twisting knob like steering wheel . variable adjustment made accurate game play . bosconian some vocals not included other version . wireless feature cool doesn't seem cause response lag . though , you want make sure you stay within line-of-sight while playing . joystick layout much more arcade-like simulated wood grain nice nostalgic touch . problem these games they still not 100% accurate arcade translations . part problem tv screens aren't sharp arcade monitors , nor same aspect ratio . many arcade monitors conventional tubes turned side . it comes close enough keep you practice enjoy golden era arcade games . well worth extra money batteries . forget other ms pac man joystick . short , not perfect , just better	1
this lovely little collection my little pony collection toys . if your children want create princess promenade then these breezies ( small winged ponys ) part . there two different sets you get . anyway , they really lovely toys my children weeks weeks fun them . whole thing , carriages breezies incredibly tough ( really surprising ! ) so they lasted some pretty hard knocks , they brightly coloured little wings back , while getting crinkled up packaging , firmly attached haven't removed . little antenna come off some tugging , but easy reattach . they overall really nice toy , they versatile , small pretty .	1
my 14-month-old twins love stacking knocking down these blocks . they so colorful fun	1

i bought this set memories family games around dinner table dancing through my head . my best buddy chris his family this card game when we kids , we played it lot . it great fun . however , one things i remember most nicely designed cards , suits depicting each commodity . old days suits rice , corn , wheat , flax , barley , etc . when i opened package i received amazon , i found " new improved " cards new commodities new graphic design . commodities now cocoa , platinum , gold , cattle , oil , rice , silver , gas . my opinion , these " improved " commodities far inferior classics . worst offense however graphic design . it quite awful . game course play same , but i say i am quite disappointed cards themselves . amazon photo depicts classic commodities , albeit different ( crappier ) design , but least that something . if you decide order this fun game , sure specify you don't want " new suits , " request old ones instead	1
description this product very enticing . but when you open box disappointment starts spirals out control . this very poorly made kit all respects . materials used , quality pieces , manner which they fit together all huge disappointment . not waste your money . save yourself seeing your child crestfallen face . i wish i taken time return it	-1
this very cute baby cute clothes , although her slippers came off quite easily . i also thought i buying doll bottle , but it sippy cup instead . anyway , child i gave it seemed happy , but we kept finding her slippers floor	1
pictures provided tanya . moynihan this doll wrong . her pictures not rock-a-bye baby chou chou , i must admit , i relied somewhat them when deciding purchase two dolls my 2 3 year olds . unfortunate . any case , i am not wild this baby doll . i don't care little button its mouth pressed make " sucking " sounds - it seems cheesy - i am not overly impressed construction or physical features baby chou chou . i think there must far cuter baby dolls out there ; i just haven't looked hard enough . also , its repertoire " coos " " babbles " somewhat limited , which quite annoying after very short time . my girls expressed great initial interest their chou chous , then threw them toy bin where they now cooing quietly beneath rest their unused toys ! i think i would more research ( person ) see what out there i known more accurately what this doll looked like . tanya , please remove your pictures - they misleading !	1
i am very pleased this food . it very realistic looking size . definitely recommended	1
just described ; good price , too . arrived quickly . very satisfied	1
commercials make moon sand look like it stays together well not messy all . it basically like letting your kid play sand inside . it mold together if you squeeze it or put it mold but not keep it making huge mess . if i could get rid it without my child getting upset i would	-1
i purchased this my son birthday somewhat hesitantly . product pretty cool itself ; it stick together pretty well . after using mold getting it out it holds it shape enough you pick it up play it few minutes . it doesn't seem stain anything , thankfully . only things i think someone should aware packaging/storing it , playmat , mess . 1 ) after you open it there not great way store it all together . there might kit something but not this one . 2 ) mat not very big it folded like map so you really smooth it out before play . it also slides around table bit doesn't actually contain sand one spot . 3 ) it sand it spreads . my biggest concern this there cautions saying not touch your eyes , not eat it , wash your hands afterwards . it made me little concerned if i didn't get every last speck cleaned up off table someone would get sick . overall it worth purchase -- better than floam	1
i bought this game my daughter 4th birthday because she keeps beating me regular memory games . she challenged loves this game ! i only put 10-15 objects time bowl her keep adding challenge her keep her interested . i also use this my work occupational therapist variety uses : sensory , pinch grasp small objects , memory game teach people how create categories objects help them remember list objects just few examples . i used it all age groups gotten positive feedback all . my sister i play ( without kids ) laughed lot we watch each other struggle ... window other players watch through ingenious . this excellent game adapted so many ways .	1

this great strategy game . object game capture your opponent flag using your military . strategy based where you hide your flag how you arrange your various pieces . warning : if you played this when you kid , beware ! new version reversed values all pieces . most powerful piece used " 1 " ; now it " 10 " . scouts , which " 9 " now " 1 " . miners , which defuse bombs " 2 " instead " 8 " . this important if you thinking buying old version game , because you confuse living daylights out your kids , who used new numbering scheme . bottom line this great game . downsides it only two people , you need put stickers pieces identification . old days , information stamped plastic ( or very old games , wood ) . there many key points remember when playing : protect your miners . your opponent probably surround flag bombs . also , not go trekking your opponents area your " 10 " without scouts or you could run into bomb or spy . also , remember where everything keep some miners scouts , among your strongest pieces near your flag . now , enjoy	1

ok . i admit it . i am truly addict , many my friends too . while , i monthly games night group my twenty-something girlfriends . this one game we play every single time ! premise simple : green cards adjectives printed them red cards nouns . you show green apple card table all players except judge choose what they feel " best-fitting " red apple card their hand . players then place their red apple card face-down table . judge shuffles cards chooses their favorite , owner red apple card wins green apple card round . everyone takes turns judge , once player won set number green apple cards , they win ! best features game how bizarre funny some cards how creative funny you interpretation juxtaposition adjectives nouns ! example : green card " jealous " red apple cards played " eleanor roosevelt , " " giant squid , " " jfk assasination , " " cauliflower . " which one would you choose , why ? this game , it fun judge equally fun compete . it worth noting although decision judge final , some players try sway judge choice . i've seen heated arguments break out during this game , it common practice play card you feel judge most likely choose ( " playing judge " ) . there also strategic thought required when keep card when make " card dump " getting rid difficult cards you don't see much potential . this game most fun 4 players or more , but you need least 3 play .	1
