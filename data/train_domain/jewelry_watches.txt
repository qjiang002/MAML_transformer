locket this cable chain so tiny , you not able put picture it . after opening box completely disappointed , i opened locket see how it worked . it would not close properly after opening . quality this necklace not good - not waste your money .	-1

this supposedly " new " item looked like it either used few times or someone left it out rain . it arrived one-page instruction sheet wrapped around plastic tool . silver knob you see left side this " tool " rusted would not turn very easily . i'm not sure how this tool effective removing stubborn watch band pins . maybe this tool effective only removing pins cheaply manufactured watches - much like this item . when i attempted use it , entire plastic body would flex i afraid it would snap if i twisted knob any further . not worth sale price it advertised . most effective way using it remove knob pin apparatus gently tap end hammer order loosen pins . this definitely not worth sale price	-1
this cute locket but far too small put any sort photo it . only use it would serve would charm never opened . not worth price	-1
though design cool , quality this pendant poor . they so light color strikingly white , which makes them appear cheaper . they look like toys ! i also bought earrings set same design i'm so disappointed both . :-( only packaging good quality this product . i suggest amazon collection makes white gold good quality similar design .	-1

i bought these my 83 year old mom , she loves jewelry helped me pick these out . we thought it would good deal price . she happy look stones when they arrived , but others noted , these stones mounted end rather deep mount ( almost 1/4 inch ) which makes them rather top heavy . unless you very thick meaty ear lobes , these earrings going droop downwards , not sit pretty your ear you would expect . needless say , my moms ear lobes very thin , soon she put them her ears , they drooped downward 45 degree angle . she very displeased these we sent them back refund	-1

read other reviews i expected something small , but decent . particular pair i received two defects : 1 . one back clasps bent so it could not provide correct tension post reliable wear 2 . one stones very large , visible black inclusion near top . it visible my naked eye ( i don't jeweler loupe ) even though it partially hidden behind one mounts . maybe i just got bad pair , but given those two problems small size stones , i sent them back not try again .	-1
earings too big ... no way knowing they big they ... nothing i wear ....	-1
very disappointed watch amazon . day/date not work delivery but i unaware it until end february when i tried manually change date . i found it broken time , week after i received watch . day/date change automatically each night . amazon refused orepalce it because i band adjusted . seiko refused oreplace it but said they would repair it it back me 3-4 weeks ! i purchased it reputable local store i could exchanged it new watch .	-1
i purchased this pair earrings my 5 year-old granddaughter wear flower girl my niece wedding . when purchase arrived , they too small my granddaughter . therefore i return them	-1

amendment below review ( mar 07 ): my wife really likes them wears them all time . i'd upgrade least one more star , maybe two if i could . ---------------------------------------------------------- my son wanted buy mama present this christmas so naturally , we turned amazon computer skill training ability view lot products easily . earrings arrived today ( very quickly ) but stone not nearly robust picture depicts . stone white , like fake diamond . when viewed other kinds light , you see slight tint blue but nothing like picture . issue - clasp or ear stud flimsy . i may return them ( need ask my son ) but i don't think these earrings last more than couple wears . positive side - it really nice design	-1
these earrings look like pieces glass ; not diamonds -- no sparkle all . i feel i wasted my money . caveat emptor	-1

watch beautiful , graceful , even elegant ... but clasp designed designer who likes complexity . this , all mesh bands , clasp hell !!! out box , it needed manual figure out ... this first warning sign . setting up wrist size awkward hard . then putting watch hooking one mechanism over some rod very hard , then there more steps , each one real challenge . then when i took my watch off , i must pulled wrong lever zip watch feel groundward . happy say it ended up bed , it gone hard floor , i may looking new crystal buying experience.an older person hands no longer working well find this watch impossible put take off . i could never ever recommend this watch , not it looks , but just band clasp ... foolish foolish person who designed it	-1
this bracelet actually really nice , but too bad it so cheaply made mine broke 2 weeks . it easily fixed all i need get new end-clasps attach them leather braid , but i hoping better made product	-1

i never recieved this watch 30 or so days later amazon refunded my payment . i don ' understand why this supplier could not come up such common item but i got my money back so i am not upse t.t his why i try not buy amazon seller , preffering buy directly form amazon site	-1
this total waste money , it real cheapo like something out cracker jack box .	-1
watch quite lightweight comes good features . however , i think it very hard use . you hit buttons just right certain amount times change anything . if you lose directions , you never remember how change it . it took me over 6 months change it . i many people try alter it , but it no prevail . additionally , watch not very water resistant . i went swimming couple times now i hardly see time due water . i would recommend paying more lot better watch . this waste money !	-1

i've this watch 5 months now threaded crown or body stripped , so crown no longer locks place . i've tried contacting citizen waranty they say it not covered . citizen claims i over tightened it or cross-threaded it while screwing down , so it cost $50-100 repair . total joke ! i'll never purchase citizen watch again . i've always thought they cheap begin . this just confirms my thoughts	-1

i've bought lot amazon over years . this first watch though . i've bought owned several seiko watches . this probably worst experience i've ever amazon seiko too ! watch came box looked water damaged . watch itself broken clasp . it looks beautiful , but i bought it gift . when she opened it , clasp refused lock . its never gone far enough time set or even tried . amazon actually tried sleeze out it telling me follow waranty pocedures . how long she wait her birthday gift ? warranty process could take weeks	-1
i order amazon frequently , am consistently happy products service . however , i very disappointed this item -- perhaps my own fault failing notice no dimensions given item description . i wrongly assumed charm would approximately size my thumbnail , surprised when it arrived i could barely find it tiny blue velvet bag contained it . it miniscule -- 1 cm long 1/2 cm wide ! enamel applied unevenly , though charm tiny , it evident enamel thicker some places , contains air bubbles others . it might cute charm bracelet purse or shopping theme , but would not work pendant , i intended . i'm sending it back refund	-1
not they appear !, march 8 , 2007reviewer : rappster ( denver , co ) - see all my reviews i ordered these earrings ' gold box ' special waited eagerly them arrive . they such disappointment , i returned them next day . i not expect diamonds huge , based their cttw , but earrings themselves miniscule ! they look like they made children . i tried one earring couldn't even see earring my ear , much less tell there any diamonds -- it looked like i didn't even earring !	-1
good : bought watch feb 1 2007bad : first watch showed up dead - not working . battery ? good : amazon replaced next daybad : second watch showed up dead- not working . battery ? good : worked fine when i battery replaced .

i bought nike triax c5 heart rate monitor watch year ago . strap already falling apart near bezel . watch 2 yr warranty but not cover strap or crystal , even if problem poor workmanship .	-1
good news watch case quite nice . now could-be-improved points . it sized weird . it lot larger than you think . add it bracelet rather small so now i removed single link i barely get it over my average sized wrist , once it it still too loose . weird , but true . frankly it good looking , but i don't think i'll get one .	-1
pendant nice however pewter wrap around kind ruins entire design . it not go center design . i think it would look better slightly tarnished silver look . pewter just too dull this design necklace not work well pendant either .	-1
pic online not true representation - these more like baby cuffs . so embarassed give xmas gift	-1
these earrings looked great i really liked them but less than month , posts broke completely off earrings now completely useless	-1
i recived watch it fine , however i want complain above amazon way pack purchases , amazon pack tiny watch box huge box , then i pay lots money paying mail forwarder because this policy . i use mail forwarder miami caracas ( venezuela ) i spread 19$ instead 5$ because box size i recived huge box full air bags . this situation not first time happend i hope amazon compense me any way	-1
this great watch wear casually or formally . it works very well , easy read stunningly elegant its design . amazon fantastic place get it . best price shipping quick	-1
honest ... when i saw picture description area , it looks like awesome watch !, but when i opened package i wanted return it . if you see picture you appreciate digital information , like thermometer , digital hour , day , month , etc ... but real life , you must incline it until you able see it .. other thing , thermometer , not so accurate because your body heat affects it . when my digital home thermometer marks 72 , watch marks 92 so if you want accurate measure you need take it off , wait 20min 30min reach accurate measure ( this information extracted manual ) . so conclusion , if you want watch thermometer built-in ... just keep looking other models .	-1
this locket dime-sized -- much smaller than i anticipated . it also very plain looked cheap . mother-of-pearl locket much better	-1
closure earings not secure , result , everytime anything brushed against your ear closure came undone , within two weeks , i lost one earing . this type closure not practicle anyone who remotely active	-1
this watch such poor quality second hand fell off third day use . cost shipping claim defect under warranty more than initial cost watch . total disappointment waste time money , don't buy this watch .	-1
i wear this watch every day i usually work outside . i am very pleased features durability . it seemed daunting work features forst , but short time instruction book made them accessable easy . i only two complaints : one metal band developed slight " squeak " when i move my wrist sometimes . tin man needs oil . second despite placed huge window every night , watch not always get time signal ft . collins . i gone long several days without getting it - but when you consider most watches not get it all , i am ok spotty reception	1

i've owned several watches , including older g-shock casio men g-shock atomic solar watch # gw1400da-9av ( among others ) . first , there so many g-shock models choose . you could bought # gw1400da-9av ( stainless steel model ) same price ($75 ) during week july 24 , 2006 . this watch simply everything one ever needs time functionality : solar power ( no need daily rewinding , kinetic body movement , or batteries ) , synch atomic clock colorado ( ultimate accuracy ) , time zone adjustment ( ease jet setters ) , light button ( which also goes off when you tilt your wrist ) , stop watch functionalities , day/date functionalities , countless other time-related functions . this respect , it much more functional than patek ( even complicated wrist watch models , or more mundane rolex , etc . ) . course , it lowly casio , costing mere $75 ( vs . $ 75,000 low end complicated patek)buyers should aware watch purtty bulky , probably 5/8 3/4 . thick . one needs sporty forearm/wrist go this watch . fun wearing it couple times year , price , just look it part collection watches , i'd highly recommend it .	1
i returned these , because they too large me . fair zina , they described , i wasn't sure they would work . only reason i'm not rating them 5 , returned them , i don't know how long clasp would work . i kept gold small hoops i bought same time -- very happy them . zina product descriptions exceptionally good	1
i got these today so shocked when they arrived , wow , these amazing hoops 25 dollars . i am more than pleased , don't idea what some other reviewers complaining , i am floored price quality same time . free shipping these must , great gift idea everyday earrings . amazon got them me matter 4 days i'm hawaii , they also came beautifully packaged , i'm love them , don't let these sell out	1

apart great look seem durability , it strange feature such kind dial . you chronograph , but you not idea where it stops . 23 or 26 seconds ? difficult find out such dial ..	1
even if you not , buy this watch . i am nurse , much like many other reviewers . fact , i bought it due their reviews . it fantastic watch . easy read , illumination option handy date feature . only trouble i size band ( too long ) . i take it jeweler take few links out , however , directions doing this yourself make it looks easy ( it not ) . don't even bother looking watch , this one steal	1
i bought this watch because i wanted something inexpensive , but still professional looking . i like lightness watch , thin size , simple design . it make audible ticking sound louder than i would like , but still not very noticeable . if you haven't seen other comments getting watch sized , pay attention . i took it professional jewelry repair shop , they still couldn't remove some extra links without leaving some minor scratches . i would recommend any size adjustments professional jeweler who selling this brand watch while . jeweler i went good reputation , but not sell skagen .	1
other people pointed out , this very solid watch . i really am not afraid it breaking if it falls , or anything like . however , this partly due its enormous thickness . it not diameter watch surprisingly large - it how thick it . if you small wrist , this watch probably not you , it very noticeable . it also not especially light , obviously , but it feels comfortable enough . it keeps excellent time , i've no problems automatic signal searching	1
it very stylish watch i get compliments it all time , but display functions like stopwatch , alarm , date display small hard see . also , date off i haven't able properly set it	1
watch excellent timekeeper . automatic calibration really works ( although some reviews i'd read indicate otherwise ) . i like dial , features , ( changes dst , calendar knows how many days month , etc . ) not , though , travel this watch while without instruction book . four control buttons take some time figure out , most them so rarely used when you need stopwatch , or one various other options , you'll likely need book ( least i ) . also understand this big watch -- probably least twice thick watch you're used considerably heavier . it hang up jacket or anything long sleeves . shock , though , tougher than hammer if you don't mind bulk i'd recommend it . rlm iow	1
i own many watches , including some very expensive ones . such quality looks 1/10 price ! this watch classy quality second none . awesome !	1
baeutiful watch , offered great price . delivered very quickly . a++	1
effect thousends $$$$ watch . i love it . one best deals i`ve amazon this last years	1
i read reviews this diamond just before christmas when it sale $99.00 . diamonds better then expected i consider them fine purchase 99 bucks . no visible flaws . i am sure if i used loop i could find some but no visible yellow these clarity fair . their great $99.00 diamonds	1
very handsome easy-to-read face date window ; especially like day/date display . most watches this price range feature date only . excellent value	1
yeah , it money clip alright . going overfilled wallet down 5 card/cash only clip surprisingly easy . i found i carrying whole lot " stuff " my wallet i didn't need just causing my wallet get bigger bigger . just 5 cards , couple receipts little cash this clip much more comfortable , easier manage , looks lot better than my old wallet . i agree previous reviewer clip forcing cash bunch up under clasp when it closed . however , it doesn't take long it become second nature keep cash pulled out bit before securing it down . i haven't used any other money clips so i can't compare this one others , but if you use wallet i say this , hands down , my new preference	1
ring better real life than picture , but you still get what you pay .	1
i just recently my ears pierced needed something small i could wear continually daily casual basis without earrings looking too dressy . these earrings just perfect purpose . they simple elegance genuine pearls sterling silver findings . they even confortable enough wear while sleeping . i am wearing white pearl set right now . love them !	1
all right so these earrings absolutely adorable ! they fun go anything ! good size . good quality . i would buy someone gift	1
all natural pearls , shapes not perfect . only cultured pearls perfect , because man controls them . dye uniform size perfect , big enough they seen easily . colors ; pink , white , gold , lavender clear . even green clear green , just not my favorite green	1
this watch pretty much exactly what you would expect picture . case bit thick backplate plastic , but might reduce overall weight compensate size . it certainly doesn't feel like lead weight my fossil watches seem . i smaller than average wrist it easily sizable down proper tools . atomic time reception good even far south i am it rarely misses updates . you force update if you feel like it its really easy . what not easy initial setup . i've never really read manual most electronics , but you need it this one . keep safe place when battery dies . least now , price deal functionality quality	1

gift , this bracelet not disappoint . it appears just ( or better ) it picture . only downside , gentlemen thicker bone structure , there not any give , nor they provide extra links make it bit more comfortable . otherwise , one cannot go wrong selecting it	1
this color price special i liked look picture so i chose this model . i found silver silver makes it bit more difficult read than i would liked but it adequate . good , accurate movement other invicta timepieces i've owned or known also . this one quite heavy feel more pricey timepiece . mine running 3 seconds slow per week which doesn't seem bad but former invictas i've bit better than this . update prior review .... now watch limbered up , accuracy improved i've hardly needed touch it	1

obviously pearls flawed , but because their size you can't tell even short distance away . they're super cute , but i suggest getting them 2 or 3 time they look bit awkward their own	1
inexpensive aquamarine usually washed-out blue color . not these babies ! you'll fool your friends into thinking you've spent double	1

i bought this watch my son , marine , serving iraq , because he requested sturdy digital alarm . this one large face which he says extremely easy read any light , especially night . it comfortable , sits close wrist very little profile . he loves it , asked me order second one because he wants back-up !	1
this pleasant surprise money craftsmanship quite good . only criticism adjustment band bit tedious . it certainly worth while durable product . i would certainly buy this product again	1
actually , it fabulous watch . it looks great , everything you would expect , joy look - i've swapped it watch my wife bought me wedding present " just get used it bit " ( which obviously she less than pleased ) , everytime i look it i see really great watch i'm really pleased i bought . however , if there design fault , it would this : when you start then stop stop watch , you cannot reset without pressing holding reset button ; surely it would better one-touch reset ? also , timer - loop 3 ( which continuous countdown ) reset button ( again press hold ) resets timer zero ( you would expect ' set ' button ) , set button ( press hold ) resets timer original timer setting ( eg 5 mins ) - surely these wrong way round ? all bit odd , but sort-of ok once you get used it . seems bit sloppy though its design . nonetheless , overall excellent watch . i'm really please i bought it it very useful triathlon events , using lap stopwatch	1
i've watch 3 weeks i really like it better than i expected	1
quality product great just advertised . delivery time excellent it promised week delivery but arrived next day ! great company business	1

these earrings very pretty -- not too big not too small , just right . price you can't go wrong . gift box they arrived sort cheesy , but they me so i didn't mind . if i giving them gift i'd put them prettier box before giving them recipient . overall very pretty earrings , good value , no complaints	1

this dual watch winder awesome . not only it ultra stylish but it works great . although i expensive tastes when it comes watches , i cannot justify paying more than $100 watch winder no one ever see . this dual watch winder works great my tag heuer-link my movado . it truly great buy , no reason spend more money	1
i love watch expecially , black white color . looks casio old , modern twist . watch very basic design . dual digital , fully funtional chronograpgh watch . one other thing ; it very easy set . only problem , it not back lit . so digital part watch useless night ( if incase you happen doing something dark , night ) . this only disappointing fact wrist watch . you might think watch cost $60 self supplied light , but it not . sad . shame casio . apart , i love watch	1
this nice watch give accurate time . i gave only 4 stars because it took me hard time pull crown adjust time	1

i wanted automatic watch while , i attracted green trim this model . watch big heavy . this probably true most automatics . my issue it seems too thick . i think glass/crystal back adds millimeter or so . band slight problem i probably fix . right where metal band contacts case , one side band bent slightly causing band interfere rotating bezel . i may caused this when adjusting linkage , or it may come delivered way . i think i could simply detach band squeeze it back into its proper shape . i actually left it alone i not want bezel rotate , defect not visible . far accuracy , it seems gained 20-30sec week . i seen watch store tried it , i would probably not bought it . i not happy when it arrived , but i worn it week , i am now glad i picked i t.t he only other issue i wish luminous markings brighter . i purposely picked black face easier see markings dark ( opposed white face ) , but i better luck other watches	1

i am army because this watch it pluses minuses . i travel world , so multiple time zones awsome . time stamp feature great when i need help remember when specific event happened . solar power . it great you don't worry batteries , but most watch batteries last close five years anyway . army i find myself doing lots night missions , i go months without seeing sun because i catch up sleep during day . well , this doesn't really work solar powered watch . i get , but it hassle some times . all-in-all , this great watch , if you don't work night then solar power won't problem you , except maybe winter when you wear coats cover your wrist . just take into consideration when purchasing solar powered watch	1

but no calories count . i love this watch despite , it well designed , chest strap also links machines gym ( most say polar ready ) .. so great surprisethe chest strap battery user-serviceable well watch , so you don't send it manufacturer ( like polar hr ) . overall i think good buy , but missing calories count , would my only upgrade .	1

i really like face style watch . i like mesh band but wire may snag clothing or fabric	1
this my first watch over $100 dollars . i just getting into watches wanted something looked great would stand test time . this watch beautiful . polished look won't last forever if worn daily , but even when battle-scarred this watch still looks classy . i love battery replacement pretty much non-issue this watch . its titanium design makes it so light comfortable you might forget you wearing it . dial window pretty resilient , but i would not test too much . this most part dress watch . i also invicta abyss automatic diving watch i wear occasionally , but i don't wear it nearly much i wear my citizen . my citizen my favorite watch all time . its versatility longevity impressed me three years i owned it . i recommend this watch anyone who wants beautiful watch dressy still practical most daily life . i always get compliments it also . this watch good buy .	1

i just got this watch christmas present . it gorgeous . only thing it little bigger than i would like it . face so femanine , but size makes it little masculine . face inch half diameter , band little over half inch wide . because it so pretty i am keeping it , however if you prefer small dainty watch , maybe this one isn't you . my friends telling me bigger watches " " now so maybe they're right ??	1
this my second skagen watch . my first one , which almost identical my new one , lasted ten years daily use . i love two-tone combination gold stainless steel . my only disappointment , glance , it difficult tell minute hand second hand . i think hour minute hands should slightly more heavier than second hand . otherwise , i love profile design this watch including where comfortable mesh band meets watch face	1

this probably one casio least expensive wave ceptors . it synchs every day indoors watch case that not window . digital display shows day , date , other info such which time zone , what time it synched . i'm just concerned analog , digital display , receiving every day make it battery eater . it available different dials , but blue seems most common . i give it 4 stars because luminous paint not very bright . crystal acrylic-scratches easily . but that not really issue because i 15 watches , this one gets very little wrist time	1

this same model watch purchased me 20-years ago my 10th birthday it still keeps 100% accurate time . rubberized band tends out after 2-3 years everyday use . i would suggest replacing it stainless-steel metal band , which purchased any major retailer . metal band also adds attractiveness watch .... least my opinion . overall , fantastic product !	1
i bought this clip gift my husband , both he i very pleased it . it little small , but very attractive looks even better after engraved . reference previous review , it not hold thick " wad " bills , but it holds few hundred dollars ( $20s ) quite nicely .	1
excellent watch . large digits aging baby boomer . easy readability indiglo . flix feature bit balky	1
i bought this watch when it sale while ago . face quite large , measuring 1-5/8 " its outside rim , making it little too big people small wrists . band , though , enough holes it fit most anyone , though it too bit uncomfortable small wrists . leather band fairly thick , but two stays included keep end band flapping . watch face silver brushed finish . many claim face " lot going " , which true four sub-dials , but it keeps style pilot watch . these subdials show month , date , moon phase , day , all deep red hands cocentric-design silver background . time easy read red-tipped hands hour ticks . there additional ticks , five per minute , which seem extraneous only there design . bezel series numbers allowing conversion calculations volume ( liters , us gallons , imperial gallons ) distance ( kilometers , nautical miles , statute miles ) , which probably useful if you're pilot , but not many others . best design feature push-button adjustments . while time familiar crown pulled turned , day , date , month all advanced simple push one three buttons . this much easier than pull out tiny crown just right tick then turn . watch also water resistant 100m but i never tried it . whole , watch looks good keeps form pilot watch . due its leather band , it more informal watch , works best bigger wrists . thinner or metal band slighly more comfortable fit would nice	1
i love this watch , it looks great very stylish . i highly suggest purchasing this watch . only one problem fact it hard size , i would consider purchasing this store	1
great working watches . much better than cheapo kit i got off ebay . nice , neat case .	1

these watches very different color size . anyone looking cute accessory would enjoy these watches	1
it so colorful attractive kids . they really fun this watch best part , your own watch rest while ..	1
this replacement identical ring i lost . i glad it backon my finger	1

i got this ring my girlfriend her birthday . we both loved it , it really quite beautiful . yet we still can't put it back together . it apart two months now , it really disappointing . if you're amazing putting things together , than you'll like it . if you're not , you'll probably still like it , but you might wan leave it together	1
i love this ring . it looks great , perfect fit , exactly described company . silver insanity delivers quickly fun products	1
best price pair 7mm gold ball earring i've seen long time . i feel like i got lucky	1
those who feel 7mm too big ; they not . those who feel quality may marginal ; quality superior . i worn them several months straight - never removing them they fully met my expectations . i recommend them without reservation	1
basic problem this kit its most essential piece . blue plastic link remover not come replacement pins . it requires focus properly align tool push pin friction-fitted watch band link pin . novice wll almost certainly bend or snap push pin some point . when i called company replacement pin , representative didn't hesitate offer it mail without charge . so , why not include few kit ? kit long nose pliers good quality needed extract watch band dislodged link pin . tweezers ( six ) screwdrivers useful some situations , but small hammer make flush replaced link pin always useful . my kit came instructions but why not illustration ? kit list price one hundred dollars doesn't add up . hardware store sell comparable quality long nose pliers ten dollars . tweezers set jewelry screwdrivers easily available . link remover specialized tool but it plastic . sale price $25 this fair value , but you want ask couple replacement pins your order	1
i bought two pairs this price . i put one away extra gift . they even lovilier when you see them person than they look page . real 5plus star deal !!!	1
two-toned crossover design these hoops adds more interest pizzazz standard hoop . size just right me : big enough show off twist design but not so big it overwhelming . i also like weight : lighter than they appear so i don't feel like i am carrying load my ears . i also happen like hinge snap type closure . good looking gift box , even if it just gift myself . why not five stars ? - wish everything i want costs least 10% less	1
this great looking watch vendor very straight forward fulfilling purchase ( no hassles whatever ) . main difficulty watch impossible read low light/dark conditions . it no light silver hands against silver face don't provide enough contrast read low light conditions ( like restaurant )	1
hey , i've contemplating buying these hoops while , but their new price helped me make decision . i got them just 2 days they very well-made closures solid , feels like you'll never loose them . they perfect , not too big , not too small light-weight . i also like they kind thickiesh , very noticeable ans shiny . bargain ! thanks amazon	1

got my watch few days back . first thing one notices , it nicely packaged . however , disappointment came when i learned crystal not sapphire advertised here ( usually it stamped backcase ) , but less expensive mineral . i wrote croton customer service 2 emails regarding this issue , got no reply - so much one reviewer claim " best customer service company america " ... i finally got confirmation amazon ( very promptly - i pleasantly surprised ) , crystal fact mineral - so why haven't they updated this product description ? after all , it makes huge difference , since sapphire much more expensive . nice solid case bracelet ( clasp looks bit weak ) , crystal back . printing face looks kind cheap . glow dark stuff not good - hardly holds any " charge " . better than my $50 casio , but overall , despite low price ($75 ) . i wish now i saved my money invested something tried like seiko automatic instead . my next watch seiko black monster	1

i really love this watch get compliments it all time , but just couple things bothered me led me leave 4 star rating instead 5 . - my resin strap started cracking within 1 year i looked high low many store specialty watch shops replacement . turned out strap pretty much custom no standard ironman replacement strap would fit it exactly . i call timex customer service obtain replacement , so i got 1 extra just case . i tried replace strap myself , but it super difficult . timex used really tight non-springed pin i only able get one pins partially out . i started damaging metallic casing , so i took it watch repair shop finish what i couldn't complete . repairman thought it going easy task , but it wasn't . he said it took long time pry pin out it broke he tried remove it . when he finally got it out , he used spring-loaded pin instead make it easier next time . oh yeah , he replaced strap . - week ago i tossed watch kitchen counter backplate fell off . i tried snap it tap it back , but wouldn't go . seems like it tight fit . looks like i'll visiting watch repair store again . other than these two issues , i love this watch . i think most men enjoy this watch , just aware straps hard find ... replace	1

i bought this my wife this christmas ( gave it her early -- couldn't help myself ) . this normally wouldn't kind thing i picked out her . she says i good taste jewelry , but i usually choose either diamonds or colored semiprecious stones her . this seemed kind plain picture . nevertheless , it her wish list , so i bought it . one thing note pendant relatively small -- but not too small . it shows up nicely long she wearing something like turtleneck or other plain sweater . it would get lost if she wore busier pattern . also -- this my one disappointment piece -- it " one-sided " . other words , way it appears picture way it appear wearer . you can't turn it around form " " shape . this because back pendant flat , filligree not really visible . not huge deal , though . nice piece , overall	1
fairly pleased these . i like anklet bracelet this style quite bit more , but these not bad all . i kind wished crystals string flexible such person move their head they would not always stay straight line . i mean don't get me wrong ... earrings dangle move . they look all mounted silver rod , which swing top . maybe this reason , but i think they'd look nicer mounted loose cord . all i know i'd complain lack structure symmetry . anyway ... damned picky person , these quite nice	1

person this lovely necklace looks even better than pictures . it larger than it looks site but it very striking looks great . however , ring it comes wear very tight - plan taking pendant off ring wear it your own chain . it definitely worth money , especially since price dropped	1

i've this watch around 18 months now . it tough , looks good doesn't mark it yet . it loses out two places though . firstly , it remarkably short " standby " time . take it off early friday night then sleep late saturday it more than likely stopped . take it off day alternate dress watch there no chance it'll still going . secondly - i've spoiled electronic watches not adjust date month end 28 30 day months so that pain . other hand , ripoff prices i pay battery my citizen changed ( mandatory water seal testing ) make it well worth hassle	1
what i wanted , when i wanted it , time , right pric	1
quick , what difference higher end citizen watch tag or omega or rolex ? price ! not only citizen watch made incredibly high standards but it looks outstanding never needs battery all this fraction price other watches . even citizen price increase december 1 last year calibre 2100 titanium other citizen models this price range ridiculously under-priced . i currently own four citizen eco drive solar watches three them titanium models . i own gold toned stainless steel moon phase watch , titanium nighthawk , titanium skyhawk , calibre 2100 . they all superb but i must say 2100 most impressive bunch . 2100 also easy read operate . so while my james bond omega seamaster watch sits drawer waiting me find time send it expensive repairs my wife rolex loses time , my citizen watches just keep trucking !!!	1
very happy these earrings . i enjoy two tone gold jewelry happy quality these earrings once they arrive . you won't disappointed this purchase	1
ok let me honest , never wanted pilot(ok maybe blue angel pilot ) , don't really care all functions dial ; this watch just looks good ! love it ! reviews big or heavy scared me bit , not case . this watch screams quality , i've several comments it . little confusing set first , but fine once you get hang it . definitely love watch look quality , backlight fine when you need it . very happy my purchase	1

these earrings so perfect i no plans take them out . i shopping tiny hoop earrings least year , but i never saw what i wanted . everything i examined too big or looked like it would hurt when i slept them or they'd get caught towel when i dried my hair . recently , i thought looking childrens ' earrings began my search amazon , not really expecting find anything . i ordered these chance ; things rarely look same hand they online , but return policy generous ( no 20% restocking fee ) . less than week later , i received earrings remarkably sturdy their diminutive size , barely noticeable when i slept , not snag towel . only negative aspect endless hoop design they incredibly hard put my big , adult fingers ! i spent almost 15 minutes struggling my own until i enlisted helper . but they now snugly place look perfect . wish these available white gold or platinum	1
these really adorable earrings arrived fast ! they came black velvet pouch easy gift giving	1
this very attractive watch - much nicer than picture depicts . it deep blue sunburst dial ( much like skagen shown amazon ) . it very slender band standard double latch design . band very easy adjust(takes couple minutes most ) . besides accurate ( expected ) it lot detail dial , ( e.g. chrome around date window ) easy view all lighting situations . but it not light . large face numbers dial make viewing very easy . highly recommended	1
good : 1 . bought it $139 50% off . 2 . i concerned solar battery power . watch not get exposed much sunlight most my weekdays spent inside office or home . but it not lost its power so far , looks like it work fine tubelight exposure . bad : 1 . watch band pulls my hair . it really gets into my nerve when i am driving or immersed my work . 2 . it would nice some kind battery power indicator . 3 . no perpetual calendar . you change date once every non-31 day months . you cannot change it 9pm 6am something like . weird . not buy it $275 original price	1
i previously bought citizen eco-drive blue angels skyhawk stainless steel digital/analog watch . it beautiful look but hard read because busy dial very low contrast digital lcd subdials . i returned watch bought corso . two things this watch attracted me : ( 1 ) light weight titanium case bracelet , ( 2 ) easy-to-read dial . i quickly easily read off time , date , day week this watch . skyhawk , this wasn't possible without reading glasses . bracelet deserves special mention . it come locking pin , it integrates nicely watch case . titanium finish bracelet unusual . parts it brushed/matte metal finish ( typically seen titanium watches ) , other parts links highly polished . this makes bracelet very attractive , but i am wondering whether titanium bracelet might actually combination stainless steel titanium . all all , this great watch very attractive price .	1
great product ! free shipping ( lt ; 5 days ) . i love this watch . i bought christmas present . $100 less than any jewelry store . just visit store , write down model nimber , definitely buy this site ( least $25 cheaper than any other site i found )	1

watch extremely reliable . i've it three years it never lost time running original battery . i wear it every day so it takes lot abuse . it simple design elegant enough me wear work or out casual evening , but casual enough me wear weekends . mesh band most comfortable band you ever wear , you don't even feel it against your skin . i two-tone movado i far prefer my $89 skagen my $900 movado . my skagen also easy read time . i just love it more than i say . i own numerous watches , many switzerland . but skagen king my lifetime watch collection . simplicity its very best	1
learning curve this watch if you use it fishing may take some time . moon phase nice know sunrise sunset pretty cool too , but i didn't give this watch 5 stars because money it didn't give me one option i used more than any other previous cheaper watches , timer . this one stopwatch but there no timer you set say 10 or 15 minutes . it keeps great time so far , but that typical casio . backlight very bright , enough so you almost use it flashlight , option this model where you set it backlight come everytime you hold your arm certain way cool . if you're looking good water proof timepiece you don't really care timer issue , this one . yeah i'm vain what it looks like my arm ; it looks manly cool	-1

casio g-shock atomic solar watch #gw1400da -4av sort middle road terms price ( i paid $99 ) . it not cheap but it not too expensive either . display diameter not large but it thick , tough-looking watch ( real man watch ... :) ) . it also heavy side . so , if you're looking elegant , thin watch , look somewhere else . when i first got it , power source 50% charge . after leaving watch my desk facing up towards desk fluorescent lamp left , charge reached 100% next day . solar cell seems working . time accurate too . i checked it against computer time ( which also gets synched everyday ) . it comes small manual ( very small text ) , but i found there really no need use manual all initially . it works right out box all factory settings correct . ( manual come useful when you some time your hands browse through it get clearer idea all available features . ) watch steel wristband much too large me i shorten it ( removed 4 links , actually ) . i used swiss army knife blade accomplish task . knife tip strong enough apply pressure spring loaded rod holds links together , but small get into small area wrist band metal links ( watch arrows : these tell you where apply pressure ) . you need push down ridges rod , out ( away you ) . ( down , so you make rod shorter , out so when rod shortened , wrist band link pop out ) . i accidentally scratch band but it wasn't too bad since scratch inside . ( it easy enough shorten wristband almost everyone who gets this watch this . ) careful not slice your finger open . always turn blade away your finger when applying pressure . overall , i give it 2 thumbs up looks functionality . ( note : this watch sold multiple vendors amazon . you should check one best price . when i bought it , i wasn't aware this but found out later , little too late )	-1
this very nice , affordable watch . i like not replace batteries knowing it always accurate . people who own $1000+ watches ask me it lot . when i tell them it solar powered automatically synchronizes atomic clock every night , i only paid $60 it while sale amazon , they immediately tell me they paid too much their expensive inferior watches	1

i am not type person wears jewelry , but when i went shoping watch , because i needed one , one brand caught my eye ... fossil . everyone knows fossil , so , everyone knows they make good watches . i like this watch because color because it day # face . it like your everyday watch , but bling look . very cool very james bond . if you know what i mean . i plan wear this watch everywhere i go . you should get this one not only because it looks cool but because price . you know $$$ makes up your mind you	1

i am very small featured these perfect size . light weight very well made	1
i owned both black " monster " bracelet ( my daily work watch ) orange rubber strap ( which i sold envious friend ) . besides all compliments i received those who cant help but notice robust build this model , it also paid dividends durability under rough service job . i not diving many years however this watch i would most confident wear depth . usual , seiko not disappoint	1
although this watch ( #mc0478 ) labeled kids , it best geared girl 12-years or older . timepiece portion appears better quality than jelly strap , which looks very cheap . i purchased this gift my 18-year old sister went local jeweler replaced plastic band nice blue/green leather one . overall my sister , who loves little mermaid , pleased this watch . so far she hasn't reported any problems timepiece . price , it good value timepiece , but i would recommend upgrading band . little mermaid face main reason i purchased this watch , but if you looking good quality timepiece/band , you may consider watch	-1

moment you first hold this watch your hand , you realize it quality timepiece . first thing strikes you its large size heavy feel , yet despite , it feels comfortable wrist due its fine balance . bracelet : bracelet end links ( those attach watch case ) solid rather than formed sheet metal like you find most other watches this price range . pins holding bracelet watch sturdiest i ever seen . each bracelet subsequent links also made solid piece steel , not folded sheet , each component feather-edged prevent it digging into wrist . its removable link pins unusual machined pin collar design which , though fiddly remove replace , nevertheless ensure pins remain under-flush secure when correctly installed . bracelet perfectly flush side contacts your wrist making it feel very smooth during wear . clasp very high quality , both fold over security buckle , which deploys satisfying click , omega style double button catch . security buckle closes onto spring pin whose ends spherical thus ensuring tight fastening which should not wear use . all all these features add up watch very quiet wrist , only faint sound coming its automatic winding mechanism . finally bracelet incorporates clever hidden diver extension ( allow watch worn over wet suit ) . case : watch case , back bezel made stainless steel . case attractive mix polished , brushed machined finishes which all add feel quality function . overall impression this precision instrument rather than fashion piece ; that not say though it would look out place dinner jacket any more than wet sui t.t he unidirectional bezel heavily scalloped design , protected bezel-guards which extend upwards each lug pairs . lower guard also functions crown guard , all all , impression case machined solid billet steel . bezel sits slightly higher than domed crystal , thus providing protection scratching crystal itself proprietary seiko material " hardlex " which , i understand it , better resisting scratches than mineral glass but less susceptible shattering than sapphire . luminosity this watch astounding due partly use seiko proprietary " lumibrite " paint but also large coated areas hour markers hands . bezel only turns one way , safety feature timing dives , feels silky smooth , best i've experienced any seiko or invicta diver . it 120 clicks per revolution nicely aligned face . movement : watch uses 21 jewel seiko 7s26 movement running 21,600 bph ( that 6 ticks per second ) . it non-hacking which means second hand not stop when crown pulled out . although this makes it difficult synchronize , if slight backward pressure applied fully extended crown , it possible stop second hand . watch not hand wound but self winding mechanism very efficient i found it power reserve least 24 hours . 7s26 around many years reputation ruggedness reliability . accuracy : there several reviews where people complain poor accuracy . typically , when new , automatic movements set run fast factory because they tend slow down after few weeks use . i own three watches 7s26 movement after their breaking period all now keeping time within 10 seconds per day . i few thoughts accuracy . you ask yourself how accurate your watch need ? if it running 10 or 20 seconds fast per day then set it one minute slow you only need re-set it once every week or two when it advanced one minute fast . if you need more accuracy then , unless you willing pay least five times much swiss watch , then buy quartz . finally , if you search seiko monster you'll quickly come realize its various colours , these watches firm favourites amongst those who frequent many watch forums . i would highly recommend you purchase one see yourself !	1
my granddaughter loves this bracelet - i sent it surprise she wore it school next day	1
i this winder month now i am very happy it . major convenience well-engineered slots iserts holding watches very good quality . inserts holding watches steadily which contributes proper winding . all previous more expensive winders cushion type inserts falling out ( watches ! )and eventually rendered useless . highly recommended unit	1
i several fossil watches , every time i needed adjust band , it cost me around $10 - $15 . i found this tool figured it worth try . i able remove links 2 my fossil watches , though my newest fossil watch band too wide easily fit tool . i even used it adjust watches 2 my friends . it worked well , made adjustments they very happy it ! they plan buy it themselves ! you make sure pin lines up correctly pin , but beyond , it works like dream	1

other reviewers stated - this watch large it heavy . i think it would look best larger person big wrists or arms . night light cool effective .	-1
classy look very durable . very nice watch price . i bought mine discount store paid $6 more it . i like it , despite its 10mm thickness . not heavy if you're like me , 6'2 " 250lbs . it man watch , practical yet some style while not trendy . i haven't any problems it so far , despite dropped it twice worn it outside while working getting it soaked sweat multiple times . i don't find it uncomfortable all i forget i am wearing it . ( i suggest taking it off , leather band doesn't clean easily like metal band . ) i'm considering buying second one keeping it cleaner this time . ( lesson learned .	1
i ordered ( not amazon ) black titanium watch black face white hands ( model 530ltmlb , those you scoring home ) . after apologetic out-of-stock phone call dealer , i settled what i thought going same watch but white face black hands ( model 530ltmlw , you precise types ) . what i got instead this watch . photograph , it looks like dark gray matte metal white face . it not : it eggshell light gray metal mother-of-pearlish face . i hadn't worn watch five years : after all , who needs one cell-phone age ? ( definitive answer : anyone driving across country sprint cellphone ) . i took my sweet time selecting new watch , got something completely different what i ordered . i could easily returned it . before i , i slipped my wrist see what it felt like , promptly forgot it there . ( nice lady who answered my request time drop-dead-you're-wearing-a-watch response , i say it wasn't actually pickup line ? )the titanium thing not gimmick : this watch ( obviously ) very light indeed , solid . i hopes light gray colour undoctored titanium alloy , which case it still look good after life deals it some hard knocks . i set it exact ( down second ) correct time when i got it month ago . it either very good movement , or it secretly communicating atomic clock colorado without my knowledge . some reviewers complained poor latch : i respectfully suggest they don't know how close it . watch very secure double-latch , which poorly-explained but not rocket science - i've added instructions end . some complain noise : this might quality-control issue . i can't comment it because my watch quiet heartbeat fetus . ( update several weeks later : watch slowly becoming louder , but loudness changes irregularly , even when watch sitting my bed . it still very quiet , but but fact it changing not speak well long-term durability . ) it gets 4 stars because i can't tell time my glasses off , which why i wanted high-contrast watch first place . but they're not getting this one back . latch instructions : get us properly oriented , lay watch flat , face up . one end strap half clasp also contains strap length adjustment . open up clasp part . next strap length adjustment mechanism you see plain bar . now look other end strap : very end it solid , curved clasp . swing it open , you see wide double hook . put watch your wrist , attach double hook plain bar . next , close solid clasp until it clicks . next , close other clasp over first one , also until it clicks . it provably impossible any single brush up against object ( say , outboard motor ) loosen it	-1
pliers job seem well made . my only problem awkwardness trying align link . i guess if you remove band watch , it would make it easier . case i recommend one pin removers sit flat horizontal surface . but ... this job ( even leaving band watch ) . it comes smaller sized push pin breeze swap out	-1
i first purchased this watch 1994 when i entered selection coarse air force cct . i lost watch years later but i would occasionally try find replacement no luck . i now work us doj deployed baghdad while i need watch i able absolutely depend extreme conditions . this only watch i ever own . i cannot say enough it . maybe i'm sentimental but i love this watch	1
this watch great . i really loved digital feature residing analog face . i don't know others out there but analog watches only way go . i love fact i visually see what time it graphical representation , but i love digital features such alarm , timer , stopwatch , date feature . i wore watch 24/7 it never ever gave me problem , however , when i filming independent film within west texas silo i lost watch climbing ladder out . i climbing straight vertical steel pipe ladder i reached top hatch , which lead top landing , my watch face caught side steel ladder band pins broke . next thing i knew i heard " plop " new my wonderful watch its way bottom 120 foot watery depth !! i probably get one but i really would love one metal band	-1
product , i recalled , cost $36 double winder . product works quite well reasonably quiet . if one reads one watch magazines market one quickly find out there many watch winders out there most cost lot money -- hundreds thousands dollars . this product tens dollars works very well . i am very happy product -- well amazon ( dot ) com .	-1
pendant little smaller than i expected , but lovely nonetheless	-1
this second pair earrings i got silver insanity , i tell you you won't dissapointed . they may synthetic , but no one ever guess while you're wearing them ! they catch light beautifully , delicate silver design compliments gems perfectly . i always get compliments when i wear these . you can't beat price	1
this must watch serious runners . i mine over month i love mine . i am professional track field athlete , i train very hard win races . this watch helps me train better than any other watch i've ever . it gives you up 50 lap splits which great any workout over 800 meters track . not only but it 5 interval timers , which you set your appropriate rest time . if you serious runner like myself , i highly suggest you get this watch . it definately something you need	1

absolutely beautiful piece jewelry . i bought it young man birthday gift he worn it every day since ! unique eye-catching	1
this watch you would expect any timex watch . it easy read face while running , easy set , big button front light so no fumbing when wearing gloves little side button some . it lightweight if bit stiff start , but eventually easied bit age . i only use it running timing , not my everyday watch , but i'll buy one again when i lose this one ( i usually lose them long before they wear out ) . i haven't it long enough notice any real wear band yet , not sure if it'll wear out easier or not , but so far , so good ( 1 year )	1
great features this watch . i especially like linked timers three alarms . my wrist tiny , selection holes great ( i use tightest ) . this leave gap because band still bigger than my wrist , extra band wraps all way around , but it doesn't slip it feels very comfortable . alarm sound pleasant . color great too	1
i've two skagen watches say they my favorite . i love large face titanium bracelet ( you don't remove watch order shower ! ) . lot people complimented me watch , too . given price quality , you can't go wrong . if you ever need part replaced , you just send it skagen ; work completed couple weeks ! summary : elegant watch reasonable price	1

this watch generally good watch , but there some flaws ours -- not surprise considering price . one , there white haze under crystal when viewed sunlight -- perhaps result careless manufacturing cleaning . two , my son band come apart twice one month . later probably design issue relative all spring-loaded retainers such , general range movement clasp	-1

i buy more items you guys . i got them quikl	1
this watch definitely something i keep me while . it simple , elegant , came me relatively cheap . free shipping always bonus , i also came across it gold box deals , when i saw it i knew i it . it pink lighter pink center . bracelet large extra links , so i removed them took it store make it smaller . i think its great watch both casual more formal settings	1
this watch beautiful . picture don't make any justice . quality amazon flawless . highly recommended	1
it got alarm , stop watch , timer , lap timer , 5 alarms actually , water break alarm , water resistant , although don't go aggressive swimming it because water leaked inside mine , when it gets hot outside , water vapor rises glass dial it blurs out time ... but other than , it great watch , finest i've owned terms digital watch , i highly recommend it	1
i wanted inexpensive watch which keeps accurate time . this fills bill quite nicely . it sets itself daily even uses wwv " leap year " flag so you don't worry daylight savings time change . it bit fussy here pittsburgh ( hill country ) . it took bit experimentation find some place sit it overnight where it get good signal . it instructs manual sit it near window " six " watch pointed window let it sit up 10 minutes . i followed manual instructions several times . then i picked up watch right after i initiated manual search signal . i moved it around until it showed steady " 3 " ( highest signal level ) . problem solved . adjusting band should simple looking arrows pusing out pin , etc . except it require brute force . i broke jeweler screwdriver small punch process . i should bought expansion band same time	1
this watch totally accurate . glow dark hands numerals oversized date window , it perfect watch . it makes it pleasure look my wrist	1
this watch met all my requirements , it well suited my hand . i liked feature turning digital display off . strap also smooth , doest hurt ur skin . only negative remark i found this watch indiglo night-light not bright i expected or not equivalent my previous watch .	-1
i'm wristwatch fan , i modest collection nice luxury watches , i looking something inexpensive i could use " rough " activities where i don't want damage my nicer omega or rolex watches . i wanted something sport functions alarm . most sports watches digital displays ( e.g. casio or even other timex ironmans ) pretty ugly , they look out place wearing anything but sweats sneakers . but i pleasantly surprised this timex model . you turn off digital display it looks like reasonable handsome analog watch , but one press display functions appear again . however , there some drawbacks : - digits hidden thick hands analog display . - white black digital display isn't very clear except good light . you'll using indiglo backlight often . rest watch pretty nice overall . casing heavy , thick but thanks comfortable rubber band , i don't find watch annoying my small wrist . loop band hold end band secure stays put pretty well . overall weight hefty but not overbearing some other watches metal straps . finish isn't exactly rolex quality , it looks like what you expect $50 watch , brushing bit uneven . design modern smooth , watch looks bit more expensive than it . functions watch pretty typical any digital watch . there isn't anything watch i find confusing . long you walk through functions once manual , you shouldn't problems doing it again later without manual . usually you hold top left button go into set modes , other buttons go up/down or advance setting mode . i could completely figure out watch without manual . sport functions , three loop countdown timers allow you set up intervals . example , you one loop time running interval , then second loop walk break . chrono function keeps track 42 laps , you see each lap time recall mode . however , because hands easily cover digits , i wouldn't suggest this watch if you really need able read digits all times , stick digital only ironman modelthe indiglo backlight just adds enough light digits allow you see light any lighting condition , but i said , you'll more likely use it this watch because low contrast digits . alarm average digital watch , it good enough wake most people when placed bedside ( it isn't very loud worn wirst )	-1
this big watch price ! (44mm i believe ) .... you buy vintage dive watch find one this large ..... i agree other reviewer strap . i lost casio just like this before @ beach . i now " waterborne " dive-strap my new one ..... one directional bezel screw-down crown would nice future models ... also ready asked " what time it ?

oddly , skx175 i received actually skx009k ! what steal $129 ! watch 5-star based price alone . but jubilee bracelet gets 1-star !! it cheap feeling loose . center links fold-over , not solid . this price though , it not surprising something got cheaped out like . overall , i give it 4-star rating . missing tag !!! false advertising ( perhaps benefit , 009k perceived little better ) it really skx009k rather than skx175 ( singapore labeling lower edge dialface , whereas skx009k not any country markings ) . great buy sure !! cheers	-1

great item , don't go looking huge diamonds , but it looked good over all . my girlfriend loved it so i guess that most important thing	1
great looking watch , i shopped around best price three weeks before i ordered amazon . shipped lightning quick also	1
very high quality watch , i recommend these all luxury-fans , works without any problems , my old citizen chronograph working over than 12 years now daily used	1
this item exactly advertised . well designed , well made , heavy . my only complaint ( reason 4 stars ) chain way short . i knew this when i ordered it so i other arrangements made , but 26 " or 28 " chain would much better , my opinion , than 20 " . great value money , however	-1

watch actually better than it appeared photo . one few times when i actually state something even better value than it appeared	1
i've watch week now i'm very happy it . both digital analog time exact second after week ( checked against apple network time server ) . watch looks good i can't say i've problem digital display - if it brighter i think it would tend distracting . slide rule looks good but i doubt more than 1% buyers actually use it . one small negative point i noticed although hands luminous hour markers aren't , which makes things little tricky complete darkness - silly oversight , hence 4 stars . overall though , well worth money	-1
my grand son calls my wife " nana " so i get it her mothers day . great product	-1
i love this watch . it perfect swim workouts aquathlon races -- takes splits , intervals , etc . i use different product heartrate monitor my runs , but can't use it my swims ( since heartrate monitors can't transmit under water , also , unit itself not waterproof ) . this timex audible chime under water , it easy set various functions . it stores your workout splits so you recall them later when logging your workout . i also love 3 alarms - my schedule different every day , so i use alarms remind me when leave work school , when leave pick up my son , etc . i lost my first watch ( same model ) , but never found watch all features i wanted reasonable price . this my second one !	1
i've used this model watch past three years my cross-country career thoroughly enjoyed it . it very light not bulky all - something every runner looks watch . , interval timer really comes handy when doing timed work outs or when simply doing crunches . fit so comfortable not cut or chafe . also , battery life outstanding (+ 1 year ) . though , i few issues . i broke off band keeps excess watch strap place - though may my own doing roughness sports i play . also , i've return watch replacement due water damage . sure , it covered warranty - but it still hassle deal if problem comes up - though , i've only experienced this when steam gets into watch or while swimming high pressure circumstances - like when diving . said , when i lost watch - i immediately replaced it same model . if you're looking light , sleek , versatile watch this definitely .	-1
i ordered these earrings thinking they'd round picture seems imply . they're really nice but honestly , they're not round they look image , which i found tad disappointing first . they're not totally flat or anything like but drops look bit " flatter " person than they picture . i'm not blaming amazon or silver insanity it since they've nothing wrong . products look different pictures than person due things like light camera angles . i just want give notice people who buy these earrings . yes , they substantial piece jewelry previous reviews imply , but not so big they're distracting or gaudy or overly heavy . they're very nice .	1
these gorgeous earrings just happened match pendant i already . i've many compliments them	1
band face both so much darker than they look picture . also , amazon neglected send owners manual warranty information ( i contact skagen this ) . watch very attractive though	-1
i'm picky person when it comes watches . i'm very rough them . this watch far exceeded my expectations all accounts . its so light i often forget i'm even wearing watch . i've gotten several comments it well . only negative thing i say this watch mesh material band difficult get water out . i useally take mine off wash my hands . overall its good looking , well made , tough time piece	1
i owned this watch nearly 3 years now , it wonderful . it looks great , i never replace battery ( according citizen , i never either ) , it keeps perfect time . clasp very easy operate it fits very well . it definitely lightest watch i ever owned . i only 2 gripes , one small , one could killing point some people . small gripe crown ( used change time/date/day ) bit difficult pull out correct position move date ( months less than 31 days ) . you pull it only halfway out ( pulling it out fully allow you set time ) , but it tendency go past fully out or fully closed . larger gripe this watch scratches very easily . i use computer everyday extended periods my job . because this , bottom band scratched considerably my desk which leaves dark grey marks my desk scratches band . i also scratched metal part bezel just bumping into something . titanium nice light , but probably not best metal watch , especially if you plan wearing it daily basis ( even office environment )	-1

i searching watch weeks , saw picture this watch paused . intrigued i began read specs : alarm , chronograph , thermometer , light , stopwatch , world-time zones more , what catch ? $55usd c'mon seriously all those features all ? i still skeptical but when i got watch put it my wrist i sold . solid , well crafted , unique sporty/elegant combination . my only gripe slight increase body temperature give innacurate room temperature . we can't world but casio come close this price i honestly say go it	1
just got my watch today . it perfect watch . i shopping around i thrilled find it amazon more than $100 less than retail stores ! ilove it .	1
i rec'd this today . i looking while white faced stainless watch kept coming back this one bulova . ( i looked nearly two years ! ) i some looking around online stores amazon far best price ( they beat everyone least $100 ) , so i what any girl would , i bought it . it substantial watch . it not watch someone looking something dainty or unassuming . i don't think it heavy , it just feels like you've got watch . i personally like size weight . i plan this my spring/summer watch until it dies or something happens it . i seiko coutura black mop face w/diamonds i love , but i wanted something different but sort same this one it .	1
they sparkle well look good anything else i seen mall stores . i like non-cup style studs , i think they allow more light flow through stone . save your cash get these . she very happy you spend extra money fishing lures or something . ;-)d o not go jared jewelers if they near you ... they evil people .	1
soon i saw this watch i get it . i loved it because it really nice details butterflies beautiful . it really nice looking good quality watch . only problem i it face quite big . if you small wrist it very large . i still love it would never return it but feel like it could lot smaller .	1

very nice watch price . very low profile nice flexible band . would like smaller face but otherwise great watch	-1
this bracelet very simple elegant . pav� cz great sparkle , but isn't overboard . i also like fact it rolo bracele t--t he links delicate small , but very sturdy nice gleam them . furthermore , charm " o " nice style doesn't look gaudy . there some tiny little dots back charm ( not so sure what those all ) . this bracelet looks great stacked top my silver bracelet watch . wearing any bracelet make it hard type , but this one cool because you actually peg it nice tight your wrist wrapping " stick " part clasp beneath rolo chain if you want it out way . i get compliments every time i wear this bracelet ; so , it nice it supports good cause since it get noticed . obviously , if you're looking fine jewelry , this might not your choice , but they say , " diamonds forever , but cz right now . " ;-) i would recommend this those their teens , but even women their twenties thirties who like whole sterling-silver bling-thing . also , definitely recommended those interested supporting good causes such ovarian cancer awareness .	1

nice quality . it shame they not same longer cords well	1
i ordered one these time i spend gym track running , also it good choice if you go swimming every once while . course , price you not getting professional sports watch like omega seasmaster , but occasional use it just great . it all you need - stop watch , alarm , nice light timex calls indiglo , etc . it also comes black plastic strap feels good unlike leather really " water-friendly " . anyway , who needs 50m water-resistant watch if strap " survive " nothing more than splash water . far accuracy - so far it ok . i it 4 months now i adjust it only once -- it 2 seconds behind . it doesn't fancy functions you would find casio g-shock series , like address book stores 50 names numbers or sophisticated stop-wtach split times or measure per lap time , nor it altimeter , but then again you get it less then $20 . overall , i give this nice timex 5 stars - it great value watch occasional use	1

i've owned several watches , including older g-shock casio men g-shock atomic solar watch # gw1400da-9av ( among others ) . first , there so many g-shock models choose . you could bought # gw1400da-9av ( stainless steel model ) same price ($75 ) during week july 24 , 2006 . this watch simply everything one ever needs time functionality : solar power ( no need daily rewinding , kinetic body movement , or batteries ) , synch atomic clock colorado ( ultimate accuracy ) , time zone adjustment ( ease jet setters ) , light button ( which also goes off when you tilt your wrist ) , stop watch functionalities , day/date functionalities , countless other time-related functions . this respect , it much more functional than patek ( even complicated wrist watch models , or more mundane rolex , etc . ) . course , it lowly casio , costing mere $75 ( vs . $ 75,000 low end complicated patek)buyers should aware watch purtty bulky , probably 5/8 3/4 . thick . one needs sporty forearm/wrist go this watch . fun wearing it couple times year , price , just look it part collection watches , i'd highly recommend it .	1

i able replace battery my watch . it didn't come any instructions . i experienced some same problems other reviewers bits loose falling out , but i discovered you push them into sockets hard . they snug after . then you adjust tool fit slots your watch . hold watch one hand . turn left loosen back , then right tighten . it came nice wooden box	-1
nicely designed , works well . plastic fittings not quite fit feel fine watches , but what heck	-1
this great watch . not so many features you get confused . it stop watch , date , day week , alarm that all . it sporty comfy i like it	-1
i purchased these earrings i am excited quality but not size . fair , i knew little diamond studs until i research amazon learned bunch over course couple weeks , but one thing i wish i'd seen pictures diamond studs " actual " size next each other - i.e. not blown up screen look pretty . 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 , 3/4 , 1 carat total weight pairs would nice see all once . i seen this i might opted larger size ( perhaps slightly lower quality so afford it ) . yes , you print helpful " actual size " report amazon , but this not any small sizes except 1/2 1 carat studs ( nothing ) . one more thing , gemological report i received not detailed " sample " website . there appears actual photo my diamonds my report but you not see drawings show flaws occlusions . this would nice . also , there fewer descriptive terms ratings than i expected . example , my certificate it says " g-g/g-g " polish symmetry . although it bound presented well , i hoped something more like sample website . flip side , these diamonds really high quality . i compared them coworkers larger studs it immediately apparent these colorless clear ( my eyes ) while others bit cloudy not nice . quality studs advertised . one stud vs-1 other vs-2 color both g-h . total carat weight 0.72 ( not 0.75 hoped ) but this above guaranteed minimum spec . 0.70 . product received very quickly , well packaged presented . i would absolutely purchase this type thing amazon again ..	-1
i purchased jewel jet hopes able keep my wife rings clean sparkling when we them cleaned jewelry store . results after using jewel jet good ( if not better ) than when we them professionally cleaned . machine light easy use . just fill top 8 oz water , wait three minutes , push button . it easy results wonderful . i would highly recommend this product anyone who wants keep their jewelry looking new day it purchased	1

this modestly priced nicely designed watch . it understated timeless its appearance . i think it bargain	1
watch winder works exactly described . i think this good value product . especially when compared multi hundreds dollar watch winders market . it look little bit plastic . but winder well built reasonably quit when turning . it comes 4 different timer settings 3different turning direction settings : left , right alternating . i calculated number rotations per day based some measurements . setting : : rotate 33 seconds , rest 12 minutes : 300 rotations/day : rotate 10 minutes , rest 90 minutes : 660 rotations/day : rotate 30 minutes , rest 3 hours : 940 rotations/day d: rotate 1 hour , rest 3 hours : 1700 rotations/dayi use setting my watch eta 2824 movement . every watch specific requirement how many rotations per day it needs remain fully wound . see you watch specifications . winder not come possibillity run batteries , pity i think . i just bought it i not say anyting long term reliabillity but assuming it keeps running i think this i very good buy . so far i am very pleased it	-1

i looking watch i would feel comfortable wearing business engagements yet still not feel over-accessorized walking though home depot . this watch came up numerous times searches amazon . criteria i looking 1 ) sapphire crystal , 2 ) multi-faced dial , 3 ) not too flashy , 4 ) price . biggest problem typical " fashionably sporty " watch faces too big or too thick or simply contrasts too much band . i dislike black faced dials polished bezel band . this watch it all . watch utmost quality . you could go macy pay $400 this same watch . band nicely polished clasp typical seiko , that good . hands all aligned perfectly 12 position adjustable if they're not . mine not out box . hands actually blue , but provides nice hint color otherwise bland face , very appealing . there nice weight watch . its actually lighter than other similarly sized steel watches i've . there no light , so previous reviewers comments after-hours time checks accurate . hands typical luminescent hands . they hold light 20 minutes maybe . you won't waking up night check time this time piece , but that why you alarm clock . deciding factor me sapphire crystal . it must . i'm not one spend $500 watch because i'm very hard them . mineral crystal simply too easily scratched . i liked some citizen designs , but simply won't spend kind money mineral crystal . seiko quality , sapphire crystal under $150 this steal . overall , i'm very happy ; 5 stars .	1
this item requested gift , it met all expectations . also company provided prompt efficient service . very pleased	1
these high quality well made earrings smaller than dime . stones continue bottom earrings , but there not stones inside back ( other words they not inside/out design ) . instead there nice scroll design backside loop . i'm very pleased my purchase . i wish they larger or amazon offered same earring larger hoop size	1
i honestly wasn't expecting much $1.99 although i buy two them . what surprise though . very very nice little bracelets . very tiny white creamy bead type pearls irregular shapes look very good way fit my wrist very easily look great . i pushed them up my arm bit so they fit little tighter , looks better way i think . identical i think well what pictured amazon page . i also own expensive pearls no they aren't nice those but money it sweet somewhat elegant look . especially when you wear two them together . yes they definately cute stretchy . not bad 5 bucks altogether . it ain't mikimoto but i am absolutely satisfied .	1
i bought this watch it really looks cool feminine . i love style stainless steel band pink dial . it dressed up or down . it goes well pink , purple or peach color clothings ... or just anything . definite buy keep .	1

i bought this its affordability seemingly simple operations good success it so far . heart rate monitor strap fits around your chest sometimes doesn't read correctly unless there wetness sensors your skin ( water/perspiration ) so it frustrating times when you get incorrect readings . overall i think it serves its purpose my heartrate monitoring while training my triathlon	-1

numbers easily read . fits my 10 y/o daughter wrist quite well . looks nice less expensive watch	1
this watch very nice . it goes dress or pair jean . however , this watch very tiny , diameter this watch less than 20mm ( including stainless ring ) it exactly 15mm diameter dial , so if you middle large wrist ( you probably want go different watch , because big wrist ( sadly , which i am ) this watch just don't go together ! ) i wish amazon indicated little detail watch information before i brought this watch . anyway , thing pink color dial , it not light pink like i expecting/hoping . it more like milky light peach pink , i can't even describe color , i think it kinda strange pink . ( maybe it just watch i receive or something , i am not sure ) . overall , i still think this nice watch , which i think it truly deserves 4 stars current price they selling .	-1
solid good looking watch those who like or need databank function . i like my phone numbers watch even though i use my cell phone directory more . you store other data involving names/numbers well ( i.e. birthdays ) overall very satisfied yet some issues follows : ( 1 ) no second hand . ( 2 ) multiple alarms nice snooze feature nice yet alarm tone little quiet if you're deep sleeper . ( 3 ) backlight not great . you need look hard see time . definitely can't use if driving want glance quickly time . ( 4 ) databank 2 pages which scrolled back forth . ( 5 ) watch heavier than databank/calculator it replaced . much more stylish though . i would recommend highly am looking buy one different color . $20-$30 this watch great purchase	-1

this long-standing standard solidly designed well-priced diver watch . i owned this model watch several years . only reason why i get new one because my old one gets too beat up scratches like , but not because any failure . mineral crystal superior resisting scratches so much more quality than cheap plastic type . stainless steel case looks good offers rugged protection internal components . i never situation where water leaked into internal part watch . you get best both types displays ( analog digital ) . i put dual time function use when i travel overseas don't want readjust analog display . this no-brainer if you market diver style watch	1

my girlfriend loves diamonds pearls ( quite few both , very nice pieces ) . i looked through something get her valentine day ( 2007 ) all items amazon this struck my fancy . it not her usual fair ( white gold , lots diamonds , old-fasioned pearls , etc ) but i just thought it looked very pretty young/playful . i took risk got her this . she loved it right when she first got it . she said it looked decent quality ( important , since you can't tell picture ) , commented several times how sparkly topaz . she not fan cubic-zirconia ( too sparkly fake ) loves diamonds ( very sparkly ) . so this good thing . blue also good color . i don't know if it matches picture well , only she liked i t.t he diamonds tiny almost not worth it . i'm not too worried , they add little bit not focus . mainly i thought it well balanced colorful bracelet . definitely recommended	1

i just purchased my second these watches ( my first stainless steel skyhawk model ) , am smitten these watches , but realistically see few drawbacks them . first , few selections long list pros . this watch extremely durable , definitely stand up bumps bruises daily life . i've worn this watch everywhere , work gym airplane beach , only time it stopped when i submerged it briny sea water , water somehow got into watch itself . it repaired under warranty , no problems or questions . eco-drive power supply great- save rare malfunction or mishap , it doesn't need changed . it'll keep itself fully charged fluorescent lighting we all work , or if fails , it'll charge itself fully within three or four hours direct sunligh t.t he multiple time zone functions very handy someone who travels frequently , i . you simply set time zone digital display , simultaneous pressing two buttons side watch , it'll switch time displays digital analog displays . this function very handy if you're more than one time zone away home- when i'm traveling europe , it very convenient able tell time home simple glance opposed mental gymnastics calculating time difference . slide rule crown also very useful if you want calculate arrival time your flight , or amateur pilot , figure out amount fuel you'll use your flight . again , all very useful . now , cons- watch large . i mean , big . if you like large watches , i , that actually pro , but some people don't really go style . also , anything other than titanium , it rather heavy too . there no forgetting you watch , although you get used its heft rather quickly . con would ( sometimes ) complex methods changing times . you can't simply pull out crown turn , you select correct time zone digital display . it very precise ( which upside this feature ) , but it little time-consuming . however , it pre-programmed daylight savings time , so when time comes change clocks , that just simple push button . it just takes little getting used , but once you , you'll never wear watch . conclusion , i'd like reiterate this watch great timepiece , one i've just duplicated my collection ( first watch my wedding gift , i can't bear scratch it again ) . i highly recommend this watch anyone	1

this thing miniscule . it barely fits my ( petite ) seven year old neck . although size mentioned description , picture misleading - pendant itself * smaller * than image screen - i consider borderline false advertising . i should more aware buyer , so this review isn't say product bad , just aware how small it - my daughter couldn't even find it bag when i gave it her , it so small she thought i'd bought her empty bag	-1

ordered this knowing it inexpensive but what i received worse than expected part because amazon sent wrong item . spoke customer service who sent replacement which they promised would inspected first ; however , same wrong item again sent . problem item switched silver heart locket , one even cheesier than product listed . i contacted customer service regarding replacement ; they recognize now real problem working correct ... eventually . both lockets returned ; there didn't seem any way getting proper locket . i wound-up ordering completely different design vendor	-1

i am rather picky , but liked not only look these earrings webpage , but also name . they not what i expecting when they arrived . they okay , but not nearly what i thought they would . they not very sea opal-ish -- they look too glassy transparent . silver also okay , but could better . i would not recommend .	1
i paid over $150 this watch couple years ago , i loved it when i first bought it ( many other reviewers this page ) . however , it took 18 months band break , then less than 2 years watch completely die . solar charger slowly quit working - first i just couldn't set hands watch because it stuck " recover " mode , but digital display still correct so it still somewhat usable . then after few months this , everything went blank . i sent it off casio expecting quick , inexpensive repair ( or even free repair , i expected them stand behind their product ) . shortly thereafter , i received repair estimate $94.11 - more than watch currently sells brand new ! so ... my opinion , watch probably worth $69.00 it currently sells , but don't expect it last more than year or two . i won't buying casio	-1

i'm giving 2 stars instead 1 because their customer service ( communication such ) very good . i purchased this bracelet few months ago ( few days ago ) unfortunate experience previous reviewer . i taking it off it snapped middle . once you could see insides , it obviously not pure sterling silver " materials " portion indicates . i returning this item new one ( already gave my girl matching one ) may not even wear it all ... * very disappointing	1

i early version this watch 17 years , when it malfunctioned , i decided it time get new one . previous watch repaired 2 times earlier , unfortunately every time i got it back coserv , it would less less accurate , thus i decide get new one . new one made maylasia vs japan ( i read this site one needs concerned ) , lighter weight , but kept time well one week . i bumped watch table ( nothing severe , previous watch endured much more ) it immediately started gaining more than 10 minutes per hour . i high hopes this watch would least meet , hopely exceed durability previous watch , but it not make it passed one week casual wear . i returned it disappointment	-1

this beautiful watch , but just word warning - it big ! i actually returned it smaller one . watch face 30mm , which quite bit larger than most women watches . face almost size my husband watch . if you like big watches , then you love this one , it beautiful , but if you want normal size watch , i would reccommend you keep shopping	-1
i received my new fossil watch just few weeks ago . first , i pleased watch . overall appearance nice , its very dainty thin band . green dial pale lime green , not too bright . everything going good until yesterday when i noticed watch seemed stopped working ( this only after 2 weeks it !! ) . i reset time it started ticking again , so i thought it just fluke . now it working sometimes but generally running slow ( time keeps falling farther behind ) . if this battery problem already i am very disappointed amazon would send out new watch old battery . i expect take this up them , obtaining new battery isn't very easy because there isn't fossil store nearby . manual it says mail watch new battery , which costs $15 !! how inconvenient . i am not impressed	1

this invicta 2699 watch , it nice watch , case stainless steel , polished , looks very well , solid . transparent case back , although there nothing exceptional look . dial mother pearl , clear clean , not too many words or other dials it , looks elegant , roman numbers very good dial ; hands big enough seen even poor light conditions . movement miyota automatic 21 jewels , works fine , price . it poor power reserve , so if you not use it 24 hours , it stop , nothing worry	1

item arrived perfect timing . earrings good quality , but not best one	1
these earrings great . they perfect size . i would recommend these anyone who likes classic look .	1
i little apprehensive these waveceptor watches after reading reviews them . common complaints included scratches face , atomic synching problems , difficulty setting up watch first time . i received my watch it perfect condition , no scratches , light or otherwise . it light but construction feels solid . i wondering what initial setup going like , since others claimed it taken hours (!!!) . it literally took me 15 seconds . it involves holding button down 5 seconds , pressing other button few times . once it set up , watch immediately synched itself my local time no problems all ( i live central florida . ) i've only owned watch day now i must say i'm impressed it so far . i haven't experienced any troubles mentioned other reviews , i'm very satisfied my purchase . also , i chose super saver shipping , amazon told me it'd take 3 weeks get it me . i received it 4 days	1

i bought this item my grandaughter whose birthday august . i think she like it lot . i know i	1
we bought this watch my 8-year old -- who loves it . we deliberately wanted him develop his time-telling skills ( i.e. , no digital watches please ! ) , " cool " watch , too . velcro strap , second hand , water-resistant qualities ( " i wear it shower , mom ! " ) , indiglo face ( very cool movie theaters ) made this great buy .	1
it good value money -- too rough edges	1
i bought this watch two months back am using it casual watch . but it would go formal dress even . works promised ; i tried synching this watch two countries , three signalling stations several time zones , it works perfectly well . quote cons , it bit chunky , but that ok since i'm using it casual watch . back watch plastic , which makes it look cheap but don't know if there any specific reason . also it would've gratified my every needs , there ' indiglo ' or ' nightglo ' feature . complete darkness , irradiating hands look fine , but if it half light , then i spend second or two searching hands . these minor things i am perfectionist , so here i stamp 4 stars it .	1
i've only this watch week , so can't really comment long term durability . however , it ultra cool watch . although i've not got scale handy moment , but it seems lighter than my ipod nano . really featherweight watch , therefore very comfortable wear . dial color really can't adaquately captured picture . it very attractive , much more striking than image indicates . several people asked where i purchased it . i'm very happy this choice	1
watch everything i hoped except i wish blue dial little brighter blue . handsome , just not impressive or eye catching . other than minor complaint , it very slim very comfortable wear . you don't even feel it your arm	1
this necklace turned out fantastic gift . she wears it everyday every outfit . it looks great jeans t-shirt extravagent dress .	1

wife hard time watches this one made her very happy	1
exceptional value classy understated design . keeps time superior fashion highly recommended	1
this watch great . it recharges itself , self adjusts atomic clock , world time , auto lighting , etc ... just mention few features . this shock series , it really sturdy scratch/water/weather/heat/shock resistant ! it both digital analog hand view time(whichever convenient ) . this synchronizes atomic clock(time daylight savings ) which means you need not adjust time . interesting feature if you tilt your hand dark towards you then watch lights up showing you time ! there few cons . there no seconds hand it(but there digital second indicator ) . this watch slightly heavy huge . but after few months you get adjusted it . you need go through manual there so many features you only four buttons	1
i bought this watch gift friend who requested this exact one . he loves it . personally lights come off far too frequently no reason would little too much me . it certainly largest wrist watch i come across but if this what you're looking knowing it g-shock which makes it great watch , this one you	1

im 14 i go school .... i bought this watch because i got nice allowence wow people school thinks im rich cool : !!!!!	1
watch even more attractive than it appeared . i none noise problems described other reviews . mesh bracelet not comfortable leather bands i am used . low light it sometimes difficult see ( my eyesight good ) . but basically i am very satisfied	1
this one excellent price . good build accurate . i wish it alert function	1
i'm pretty big guy so it doesn't look out place , but this really extra large watch also quite heavy . it runs well , keeps good time movement very good reputation reliability . if you're extra large person don't mind heavy watch , you may interested this . if you're average size or smaller , i wouldn't recommend it . personally , this my weekend watch because it comes across pretty bullet-proof normal use	1
i've this week , it may not function well year , something you might want keep mind reading this . so far , however , it great replacement wallet . don't get me wrong , i still my wallet likely use it when travelling . but everyday use this far more practical comfortable carry . it also easy eyes it pocket - equally pleasant carry look . feels sturdy durable ; light but not flimsy . this hold upto 5 cards maybe 20 bill notes . warned , however , although clip hold 5 credit card-sized cards ( id , whatever else you may ) it only really easy remove topmost bottom most cards . , if you 5 cards you use quite often you may want look else where . personally , i id top my credit card bottom . other three cards ones i almost never use , or use very rarely . one concerns i purchasing this whether or not it securly hold less than 5 cards . it ( there pressure clips sides where card goes ) , but i wouldn't recommend it . just didn't feel safe enough , even 4 cards . something i not foresee purchasing this clip secures money very tightly . consequently : 1 ) when you press down clip , it drags money back few millimeters . if you put money too far back it'll crumple it up . 2 ) when secured , you can't just pull out bill , you lift clip up . first point i've found little more bothersome than second , but after playing around it half hour or so i've got hang clamping it without crumpling money . said , it really very nice item would awesome gift give friend , husband , father , or your own personal use - if it suites their or your dress style . ( if you wondering why it 4 star not 5 ... well , no real good reason . it deserve 5 stars , but little issues clip tugging money you clamp it down - although it means money held more securely - holding less than 5 cards didn't feel too secure , pulling out any card other than top bottom most cards difficult , dropped it down 4 . it may just these issues neccessary keep product fanatastic it . 4.5 stars might welcome option , this close perfect it gets .	1
this pendant really nice . i bought it gift . it just pendant so you get chain .	1
i love these ! they such good deal price , come nice box . they much better than what i expecting . : ) colours nice pastel , would go lots different things . pearls large but not too large - just right	1
these earrings really pretty . there not real great variations color each set ( they all pastel , after all ! ) but each beautiful sheen color . they also set very firmly backs - i worried , price , they wouldn't hold up . but they very nicely made . packaging okay , but not deluxe . what i appreciated there little flyer enclosed telling how take care pearls , which i found informative . all all good purchase well worth money	1
i skeptical this watch because very low price but i very pleasantly surprised . it quality finish band , comfortable , works great here east coast . it reliably synchs colorado time signal so it always accurate . great watch money , i highly recommend this yellow dial watch its black blue dial siblings	1
it nice watch dollar spent this item . catch it work concept wave-ceptor . it adjusts time according place you . so ... good watch ..!	1
photo necklace looked pretty , but i didn't realize it would so nice ! my daughter loved it i probably purchase one myself	1
my wife problem earrings because she needs small prong . i ordered her other earrings but i return them because they hurt her ears . these nice change because she wear them without pain . plus she loves them	1
i love this watch , i've it almost year . its absolutely beautiful , but simple . it keeps time very well . work i i don't wear this watch work . so i go sometimes full week without wearing it . hands stop after sitting still 24 hours but soon i pick it back up give it shake , hands spin around sets itself . its not dressy casual wear , but it also fits perfectly suit tie . i highly recommend it !	1
first impressions : it nice watch clear look . i little worried lack backlighting , but pleasantly suprised i able see luminescent dials clearly any hour night . pros : quick atomic time synchronization ( usually within one two minutes after initial synchronization ) . simple use . cons : case described stainless steel , but back piece plastic . originally listed amazon solar-powered watch , but instead powered regular battery . battery life expectancy 2 years , though it may lost longer disabling auto-sync feature . overall comments : this my first atomic time wrist-watch . it automatically synchronizes atomic time once midnight ( function you disable if desired ) or on-demand press button or two . it this scanning radio signal . according instructions , you're supposed leave this watch near window 6-o'clock side facing window best radio-signal reception . reception course vary depending your location , but watch successfully updated several times even while i wearing it . i like watches flat crystal surfaces , because it allows me paste pda screen-proctector ( cut size , course ) them , which keeps crystal scratching . crystal this watch only slightly curved , only one direction , meaning screen protector sticks nicely evenly i t.t he watch waterproof 50 meters , which ( casio terms ) means you go swimming it , but you should not press any buttons underwater . i try keep my watches away water when i , but it always good know it should survive most water-related mishaps	1

i ordered this jewelry piece gift box card . box , while attractive first glance , flimsy , got slightly crushed transit , ribbon its top frayed pasted-on . card came it much too large fit inside box or even top gracefully , message inside not centered , making it impossible trim down . said message inside appears written plain old times new roman script . i could far better my own printer , cost , i could get much more attractive card store . i say , however , piece itself looks every bit nice it photos . i might order silver insanity again , but i'm not paying any " frills " - they just aren't putting enough work into it make it worth it	1
i ordered pair myself liked them . stones pretty clear cute but earrings smaller than shown picture .	1
watch just discribed . it heavy large . person i bought it get several links removed . it would great larger man	1

i bought this 2006 christmas gift i am very pleased . i know my daughter , too . it comes pretty purple velvet bag , nice box cotton includes instructions how keep it nice . i got it great discount one friday sales	1
i received this watch yesterday would like counter some comments other reviews . watch i received no scratches crystal . it packaged nicely . it not seem too thick . it not appear cheap or lightweight . although back plate two buttons plastic , rest watch sturdy metal , it feels solid . wristband just right size me , although i gorilla wrist . i didn't find manual difficult understand . watch attempted auto-sync overnight , but didn't get signal , so i manually sync'ed it next day according instructions no problem . easy-to-read dial , low price ( $35 ) , overall great atomic watch worth twice what i paid	1
i this watch more than 5 years , wear it daily . i purchased it cayman , i think i paid lot more than amazon price . i love eco-drive , it never needs attention . year ago , eco-drive mechanism went bad , i sent it citizen . they replaced mechanism free , saying it their issue . kudos them . i able scratch crystal , but only after heavy abuse :) number band around outside still turns well day i bought it . numbers metallic band around face never worn off , but outside band nice smooth edge it now . lettering wore off band after year , so if you plan use dive table band , don't wear it daily . else , smart carry your own dive table old plastic card or your dive computer . band now finally worn out after 5 years ( which how i ended up here ) . two small strap holders just broke off past 2 weeks ( they wore through ) , band cracking but only holes ( still holds just fine ) . i would buy this watch again , obviously recommend it .	1
i love look this watch ! i enjoyed it almost two weeks now it kept perfect time date . originally i attracted seiko skx173 which i came across first . however i concerned physical size seiko might too large my wrist plus reviews indicated its automatic/mechanical movement might not accurate i wanted . later i found this citizen watch which looks virtually identical , yet it smaller ( diameter 38mm vs 43 , height 10.5 mm vs 13.5 ) , more accurate battery-driven quartz movement . it also longer warranty ( 5 years vs 3 ) which probably indicates movement more likely trouble-free than self-winding seiko . only negative i encountered it ( well seiko ) come fairly bulky rubber strap . while this more comfortable than i expected , it tend interfere somewhat drape cuff when wearing long sleeve shirt .	1
just my title states- this item purchased gift . my friend loves pendant , but upon arrival it small scratch body horse	1
this great watch , excellent service . order arrived time i love watch	1
i old ironman died after 4 years . this one even better .	1
excellent watch great price . teal color absolutely beautiful i love style . i several fossil watches no complaints . they easily adjustable , water resisant , polish up nicely look like new again	1
i bought this fossil store $85 , its worth every cent . it time , day week , date , military time . its waterproof up 100 meters . it double lock stay your arm . it glow dark . it spinning number thing . it looks good always shinny . its only 85 bucks . its perfect !!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
this not first tool i'ld add my work bench , but it some pieces i'm glad . i re-sized my watch band just few minutes only one little incident doing something wrong way . i mention instructions somewhat lacking ? hind-sight i should figured it out before i made mistake , but that hind-sight you . if your good working tools , you need adjust watchband least every christmas , then this good deal	1
great kit working watches . tools quite good quality , not flimsy cheap . case also good , thankfully wasn't just typical throw away plastic crap . inside case firm foam keeps tools nicely place . case itself firm black leather-like material snaps closed . kit contains hammer , band holding base , several different sized pin drivers removing band pins . also includes clamp type pin remover ( blue thing ) , set screwdrivers thin but sturdy wedge removing watch backs . all all i'm quite pleased product . it just what i wanted wasn't very expensive	1
this best g-shock i owned . it looks sleek well casual . i no trouble receiving nightly signal ( i live northern new jersey ) . solar power added bonus . really good deal money	1
since i never purchased watch croton , i not know what expect . watch came 2 boxes , first black cardboard box detailing croton brand silver top center lid . inside this box , watch itself encased nice padded black leather case croton name embossed top center lid . inside lid , there " pocket " stores instruction guide warranty card , which neatly concealed behind black piece material croton logo silver text . needless say , i feel good presenting this gift my boyfriend . watch itself substance it . shape watch face unique it looks like more rounded rectangle . face blue , what nice there bit light texturing face . blue color seems change dark lighter depending lighting room . numbers clearly visible , but date bit small side , but not terrible . when i took watch out case , i noticed it not running first , i feared watch battery dead . this not case however , i found watch pin side pulled out , which stopped watch . i am not sure why this , perhaps it conserve watch battery ? back watch croton name etched into center underneath , it states it sapphire crystal , japanese quartz movement water resistant details . bracelet , it not seem heavy i thought it would , but i better idea after my boyfriend tries it . however , i am expecting he need get watch sized fit his wrist , but this not all surprises me this common practice many his watches . other reviews mention , instruction booklet not this specific watch not so helpful . all all , i think this nice watch . its design simple , yet elegant . i think it good business casual watch , it dressed up office , yet worn after hours weekends . nice feature fact it water resistan	1

this very nice watch . pink mother-of-pearl face lovely look leather strap very soft . date little small but watch so nice i didn't even care . only complaint i amazon sent me this watch dead battery inside . i get new battery my own , but soon i told amazon , they credited me $10 . great , but they should sent me watch working condition . otherwise , watch highly recommended . even nicer than photo	1
i owned this watch over month now i note following : watch diameter approximately 40mm around 10mm thick . both these number seem average it looks good average size wris t.t he watch bit heavy , but sits comfortably wrist . bracelet rarely pulls hair , although i plenty i t.t he watch easy accumulate scratches , but not glass . i scratched steel around glass ( well other places ) , but sapphire resists remarkably . time keeping very accurate , compared atomic clock web . after month it advanced less than half second ahead , which result six second difference most per year . i guess results may vary different watches , but it seems nevertheless impressive trustworthy enough . timer very easy start , stop reset , one button pushes . very fast convenien t.t he alarm barely heard , so not appropriate waking . it useful though reminders , noise free location . not difficult set , but takes some time , comparable setting alarm cell phone . since it relative secondary time keeping mechanism , you second time zone set advance alarm relative tha t.t his watch not seem attract special attention it not gained any comments so far , without me bringing it conversation . pretty conservative , but i personally like tha t.t he price this watch amazon seems fluctuate 100 140 dollars . if price higher than 130 , i would wait tad , but not hold my breath too long . it definately worth money though , since i seen several seiko watches like this one enter their 20 or 30 years age still continue strong . dependable , accurate , water proof watch every occasion , most probably you cannot better than this	1

silver insanity best accessories !!! i saw image ring amazon immediately fell love . i love rings covers your proximal phalanx ( bone your finger closest your hand ) . when i received ring , ( earlier than counted upon ) , i little disappointed see how little it looked how dainty but before i tried it . i expecting ring bulky glad it wasn't . fingers surrounding it wasn't bothered or irritated thx rings slimness . i recommend using ring size chart b/c i thought i'd 6 ; turns out , i'm 7 . what misleading , though , picture . leaves shown bright , but it looks noticably darker ( inside outer rimming leaf , where gems ) when you it your hands . my fingers long slender . ring didn't twist or turn , but it didn't cover my proximal phalanx completely . i'll measure ... end bottom leave end top , it 3.3 cm . my middle proximal phalanx ( bone your middle finger closest your hand ) 3.8 cm . if you should run your fingers through your hair , leaves not get entangled ! nice ! you wear damn ring everywhere !!! i love it	1

i never adjusted watch band before i thought it going difficult after reading other reviews other watch tools . this tool could not made it any easier , i didn't break any pins i adjusted two watch bands night it arrived ease . you need pair needle nose pliers pull watch pin completely out band . i adjusted accutron lady york swiss army men maverick . i used tool remove replace watch pins , just line pins squeeze pliers slowly . accutron used solid pins swiss army used pins looked like they screws but pins cut or bent half so always push end looks like screw head	1
i bought my first casio diver watch gold face years ago . i wore heck out it , eventually , band broke . i must hunted replacement band or whole new watch but no avail . long-time friend then just sat drawer . recently , i found these watches still available so i got new one . i even found replacement band ( made timex ) my original watch . i must say i once again feel whole again . this watch timeless styling wonderful functionality very reasonable priced watch . i'm thinking getting black white ones so i switch it up time time	1
after nearly two months my two automatic watches ticking happily away . mechanism very quiet winder looks tidy . only critisism i lack instructions mount watches . maybe all winders work same way but this my first experience wone it took while work out watch mounts spring loaded accept teh watch band . once i sorted out - no problem	1

my son tells me he loves his watch would give it 500 out 5 stars . he saved up it , he bought it his own money after his adhd asperger self trouble walking home library one too many times when it time ( after more than few reminders ) . he'd also missed cello lessons school very frustrated himself difficulties he . it cool watch . it looks good , it two alarms ( cello lesson whatever else he needs ) stop watch countdown timer -- he found use so far . it waterproof/or resistant , so means when he forgets take it off before his bath it ok . this watch way he could solve his own problems , reorganize his own life make up some his difficulties . that why i like it so much . it all these features looks really cool it doesn't cost arm leg . that best , i think . i'm not sure if he'll ever need lap timer or pacing feature or anything like . i suppose those features awesome those who use them , but our purposes our budget , this watch perfect	1
zina makes wonderful jewelry why i am frustrated they use such cheap chain this pendant . pendant itself beautiful silver shines , but garnet very small . it nice red color though . i purchased this sale why it gets four stars not three .	1

this my third skagen watch . design ultra thin titanium consturction makes it ultra light . design sophisticated enough dress sleek enough sports wear . they proven reliable timekeepers i liked this one so much i bought two more my sons . less than $80.00 each they real bargin	1
i read reviews people saying their watch scratched lost paint it . mine not this exception clasp . since watch band titanium it should anondized , meaning it not going come off . however clasp few other small parts ( watch hands ) made stainless steel , so they start losing their finish after awhile . after wearing this watch few weeks , i went put my old stainless steel citizen watch . it felt huge felt like it weighed ton . i went weighed each them . citizen came around 4.5 oz , while skagen came around 1.5 oz . it also very thin , i used not able wear watch since typing computer all day band would irritate me , not any problems skagen . one other thing note , picture this item shows steel watch ( you see it face ) , if you want see picture titanium one , take product number go skagen site , or google . skagen lost star because paint coming off clasp ( not band )	1
i am extremely impressed feel , look general quality watch . it contains citizen miyota 21 jewel automatic movement true workhorse fraction price . comfortable stainess steel pinned link bracelet worth price watch . it rounded flexible brushed steel wrist links foldover adjustable double safety clasp uses pins well . easily mistaken watch costing much more . mineral glass crystal scratch resistant - but not good sapphire watch face , but less prone chipping or shattering than sapphire crystal . display watchback also mineral glass - displaying undecorated miyota automatic movement . it look stylish run well my other watches , , i receive many comments if not more invicta . it great looking watch ! good value , accurate stylish if you like sub ' look . this good day-to-day knock watch still looks better than quartz stuff same price band . if it lasts 5 years it more than paid itself	1
i've found i receive quite few compliments whenever i wear this necklace . great color combo not too heavy . price right	1
this watch looks feels great me . yes , i take out 6 links get good fit , but fairly easy only took 5 minutes ( which included figuring out how it , which i'll explain end ) . clasp locks well - firm , but not difficult lock/unlock , very secure . i little suprised how lightweight links/band . that only part watch feels little cheap . don't get me wrong , it well constructed , but it not like big manly steel band . end day , i found i loved it because it isn't heavy . i didn't give it full 5 stars because after it few weeks there teeny tiny scratch developed face/crystal . i'm really cautious gentle it , so i'm rather disappointed this happened . ( it very possibly might me knocking up against brick wall or something ) . if you're especially rough your things , this might not best watch you . taking links out easy if you're not completely inept . you'll want something small sort-of pointy ( i happened filed-down mini screwdriver , but nail would probably work just well ) . i found it easiest first disconnect standard clasp - just push pin ( either side ) wiggle clasp apart . make sure you don't drop/lose pin . links , it fool-proof - it arrow engraved back links , showing you which side pin/insert comes out . stick nail/whatever into small oval hole pry pin out side . pull it out pair pliers ( it there pretty tight ) you then remove link	1
this ring just what i expected . it fun puzzling , it looks nice . i figured it out after 20 minutes messing it(i've always good puzzles , so it might take someone else longer )	1
i loved wiccan protection knot pendant , i purchased it my daughter christmas she hasn't taked it off since . she wanted celtic tricetta necklace , but absolutely adored this one just much . thank you	1
this bracelet looks better than picture . it looks beautiful my wrist . fifty bucks i paid it real bargain . i love it . there only one drawback , it 8 inches long that too long my wrist . if it fit perfectly , i'd give it ten stars . i'll pay make it smaller . it made titanium , maybe it too tough alter . i want it fit over knot my wrist . if i get it altered , i'll wear it until day i die , which i hope 100 years now	1
i always wanted titanium braclet . i found this all places amazon.com .. i thought why not ? i very surprised when i got it this bracelet looks better person ! very high quality ... pic dont it justice its elegant design very contemporary classy .. it not look gawdy or " bling bling " tacky ..... treat yourself pick this one up	1

this invicta really nice watch but some problems : all metal surfaces polished this watch so they scratch very easily quickly . clock face bit too shiny my opinion ( hard read direct light ) . also , who needs 24h dial chronograph ( instead 1/10s dial) ? but overall this price good deal good looking	1
seller delivering immediately . watch itself sporty but elegant , suited active men	1
earrings arrived jewelery box , so they would make nice gift . earrings seem well made . post notch prevent loss back . ameythyst stone so pretty---i've gotten number compliments these earrings	1
i bought 2 necklaces each daughter christmas . girls wear them all time , they very pretty love opening up lockets look pictures we put them	1
i ordered one each my 5-year-old daughter her 2 friends valentine day . nice pearl color oval-like shapes . slightly too big 5-year-old but would good older children or small wristed adult . very dainty . great buy price	1
these earrings so exceptionally shiny cute . nice size look very well made . couple small drawbacks : pointy edges sunshine rays kind sharp also , hook part seems extra thin because normal small rubber back not fit slide right off but if you wear earrings without rubber back , they slide out you lose them ( i know this because i backtrack grocery store only find my missing earring produce section ! ) . they provide rubber back fits but it so very very tiny i could easily lose it it hard handle fingernails . but don't let those things stop you buying these earrings because they so distinctive attractive . i always get lots compliments when i wear them	1
my husband loves this watch . he so excited it looks even better person than picture . soon he shook it , watch exactly what it suppose set itself right time , date , month . he absolutely thrilled it . i thrilled price this company . thanks all around	1
everything ok . i actually recommend	1
atomic watches highly-accurate quartz watches which synchronized each day time signal broadcast u.s. definitive u.s. atomic clock ft . collins , colorado . thus , all atomic watches always accurate within fraction second any time . since atomic watches adjust automaticaly daylight saving time they convenient well highly accurate . casio makes -- amazon sells -- wide selection styles atomic watches suit various needs tastes , including g-shock watches extra ruggedness solar-powered watches which never need replacement batteries . but all atomic watches , including this budget-priced waveceptor model , equally accurate fraction second all times . if you want numbered-face watch always accurate this model real bargain	1
i am completely satisfied this product . correct time kept it great watch . i many atomic wrist watches this best one ever .	1
my last ironman lasted 12 years very hard usage restaurant business --- lots heat , grease water ! my new timex combo dual tech watch all same features , especially timers which i set different intervals . you can't beat price this rugged but sleak looking watch . plus --- it both digital time good old watch hands	1
this watch great . it full iron man functionality actually looks nicer than geeky casio - unlike prior iron man watches . i probably should gone steel band it could worn out well . it solid construction easy functionality . indiglo could little brighter but i am sure would cost battery life .	1
my daughter loves this earring ' tree ' . it looks great very practical it holds multiple earrings	1
when i received this item i could not believe how beautiful it . price insane quality workmanship . i order more my sisters	1
i bought these made set necklace my girl . they look gorgeous her . really really worth effort , unique . i highly recommend this seller . reward i got gift ... well , let just say i'm buying stuff them future , sure !	1
this really nice little pendant/necklace . stones not too small , not too big -- pendant 1 " long . bail large enough accommodate nice chain ( it comes 18 " fine chain , but you might want replace it something bit more substantial ) . price , i expecting something lot " cheaper " looking . i very pleasantly surprised quality this .	1
beautiful , clean , simple , lightweight lovely watch . great price look . perfect size really durable . got it christmas haven't taken it off since .	1
pendant gorgeous feels substantial . quick delivery product delivered promised . chain little long ( me ) so pendant hangs breastbone level , but it so lovely i haven't bothered find new chain	1
i own 27 various expensive brands quartz watches finally decided it time invest automatic . i knew stories other people who own them claim it important good watch winder , so , i saw this one decided i'd give it try . i could not see point spending hundreds dollars winder when i could use money towards watch ! :) i ordered this before i even received my new invicta automatic pro diver watch . i very tiny wrists , because , first i not think spring loader going work me . i struggled bit fit my watch holder but after 15 minutes , i got it . i using watch winder off now over week i think it great job . my automatic only 1 minute fast , although i'm not sure if speaks more quality watch or winder , all i say i think product doing what it supposed watch keeping time well . i put it winder each night before bed . it fairly quiet but just my opinion . i read other reviews where people said it loud . i expected it louder than it . like other reviewers , i am unsure how much " too much " winding . i think most watches built mechanism prevents overwinding so i guess putting it winder each night ok . my only problem now lonely empty space where automatic needs since it double winder . hmmmm ...... time get watch ! :) if you need winder , get this . it works well you save extra money get yourself watch add your collection	1
i purchased this gift certificate myself . price you not complain too much- this necklace nice addition my jewlery box . i suppose more expensive ones may sparkle bit more but this nice piece	1

it beautiful , simple , elegant watch . eyeing it year , never seen it such fantastic price . job well	1

very beautiful pearls . there visible blemishes , which makes them appropriate wear work without me feeling overdressed . uniformity very good . all pearls more or less same size . beautiful clasps too . however i agree previous reviewer it hard handle without help , especially bracelet . took me 10 minutes put it my wrist . color slightly yellowish . shape good : kinda semiround rather than potato . they'll make great gifts .	1
i needed basic watch time running this fits both well	1
i very pleased service this seller . earrings came within few days , i love them . i asked more than once where i got them . thanks	1
i've read all reviews . i too own this model . it what it designed . burlwood much more .... overpriced ? people sometimes need taken hand . especially overpriveleged . you don't know what it like rich untill you've poor . ... you don't know how good your winder till ' you find proper direction . all things , others not going it you all time . but this case i'll make exception . some watches wind both directions ... you know - go both ways ? lot .... back winder lesson , some only go one way . find out what way you need go go there !... problem solved ( help me .. this isn't working ... oh , please ! ) moral too this story " plastic world try not always wood !! god gave you brain . read my revie	1

i am college student member army reserve knowledge manufacturing/production processes . i value pieces fine engineering , precision design . i always admired automatic watches , someday when i afford one i purchase omega or rolex . i tell my particular watch there minute dust hour hand pendulum . first off , this watch should appreciated what it , automatic watch reasonable price . there no batteries , no electronics , just gears springs . some automatic/kinetic/whatever watches use pendulum charge small battery , these not interest me . pros : automatic movement , sharp visual appeal , day/date function , supposed shock resistance ( haven't beat it up enough know if this true but i trust claim researched manufacturing movement ) . see-thru case back so you watch mechanism its thing ! cons : it not rolex , so don't expect perfection . band case solid but lack heft , fit finish rolex level watch . bottom line : if you want truly automatic watch 100 bucks this great choice . orient watches other invicta models supposedly just good . you get compliments this watch	1
i read reviews these earrings i am very pleased results . i purchased my own pair get plenty compliments too	1

i never problem mine , i'm marine fact i went trough combat mine held up made it worth few bucks i paid it . i go trough watches like they made paper , this one 2.5 yrs other than lot scratches it works fine	1
i three holes each ear i really needed some tiny diamond earrings top holes . these wonderful ! they small , but exactly what i wanted . such great buy this price	1
excellent watch ( eco-drive ) i would spend extra hundred purchase titanium	1
it small beautifull , sure you want small one	1
i purchsed this watch while ago i say it simply great . animated feature simply face switching red black which set hold either color , which feature i found very fuctional it allows me switch color better complitments what i am wearing . i this watch nearly year it still gets comlpiments weekly . my only criticism comes fact it not like some more trend watches wide band actually cuff around entire wrist , which this watch takes its styling cues . nevertheless , it still great watch looks good	1
this watch looks so sleek it wears well day/evening wear . addition it makes great travel watch . i love feel nice soft leather band	1
i very much like these earrings . my only reason not giving them 5-star rating topaz quite small . you really look closely see it . but , they excellent quality sterling silver still beautiful . i recommend them , just aware stones tiny	1
my reaction quite similar other reviewer . i received my watch few weeks ago ( only took three days ) impressed its classy look --- all my other casios basic black clunkers . i like toggle switches protrude , so it easy activate them --- those old recessed ones drove me crazy trying get nail or golf tee there . it all features i wanted , but i same reaction alarm . it less assertive than other casios i've , i don't think i trust it wake me up early or if i'm tired . i've already decided buy inexpensive alarm put my bed . because screen showing digital data small , it not always easy read what it , especially if watch hand partially obscuring screen , which somehow seems happen lot . back light only goes one second time , isn't very strong , so there good chance you won't able read digital screen quickly . fyi , 10 year battery claim based using one second backlight each day , so you better look quick look sharp ---- but not often . so ....... great looks , but personality could better . that life	1

30 reviews before mine gave pretty complete description watch . i'll just say it fits very well my relatively small wrist . if you like watch but think it won't fit well because you small wrist . don't worry , it fits just fine . enjoy . after wearing this watch few weeks , i realized i am just like many others , wearing calibre 2100 exclusively now .	1
i got this watch some couple months ago absolutely loved it . it looks , feels functions really good got lots positive comments my peeps . now reason i cant get give it 5-star ( i really wish i could ); it not perpetual calender . i looking watch all 2100 qualities also perpetual calender . i hate fact i manually adjust my watch painfull enuf , i leave this flaw . if you dont mind watch without perpetual calender then you would love this watch literally bite finger off anyone puts their finger it but i want watch perpetual calender this doesnt not fully cut it me .	1
this watch beautiful . i cannot say enough good things this watchs design . its 45mm face bigger than most watches but doesnt look gawdy , it keeps perfect time very light weight . i bought calibre 8700 before this one i love both them but i would give this one slight edge . my two small complaints this watch doesnt perpetual calender which very nice feature calibre 8700 , also this watch uses mineral crystal face not saphire . i am sure crystal used scratch resistant but it no where near resistant saphire crystal would	1

this 4th or 5th watch this series i've owned . this one allows multiple interval timing . fantastic ! i ' ' chicago marathon this past fall . group i train runs 3 minutes then walks 2 minutes all our training runs . this watch alternates these intervals , sounding alarm after each ! buttons intuitive , making it easy use even quite few features . silver black color combo held up much better black metallic green timex watch line ( metallic green watch face scraped off ) . band openings which nice ( your wrist doesn't get sweaty ) . good value	1

i purchased this bulova watch christmans gift myself , this past christmas ' 06 . i small watch collection i hadn't really bought such elegant watch before , so i decided why not ? specially when i researched price how much i would save buying it amazon . looking pics amazon it looked so nice , but when i received it most beautiful watch i seen or owned . diamond bezel just right it isn't much glitz nor it too little , diamonds just right amazing they sparkle so beautifully against chronograph face stainless steel band . watch itself little heavy compared other watches i own so it definitely sturdy above all just well made timepiece i am sure , not just my collection but my wrist years come .	1

let me just say my girlfriend loved them then loved	1
beautiful . wear them all time . sincerely , gai	1
bought this watch my wife , she likes it . " + " + stylish expensive-looking+ stainless steel case bracelet+ date " -"- not too good small hand . though it possible adjust bracelet different sizes , small hand there long part band left ( under " top layer " ) . it difficult make this part invisible , it tends come one sides . - clasp tight . hope it easier open close after some usage . - combination brushed metal dial golden hands makes it difficult read , especially dim light . - golden " piece " actually just thin film layer inner side glass .	1
i love this bracelet . it very pretty looks just like it shown . looks expensive tasteful . i bigger wrists , so i'd like it better if it came larger sizes .. but it goes great my watch	1
we sent this necklace our daughter . it arrived actually earlier than anticipated she just loves it . what great company deal wit	1
i selected this stopwatch many others simply because it indiglo feature , i need operate subdued lighting . other advertised features similar many other stopwatches . use , i found it quite satisfactory . readout clear large enough read glance . i not need explore all features , but it all i would like it quite well . there short learning curve , but not insurmountable . if night vision issue , this only one .... if night vision may requirement future , it still only one . otherwise , it performs least equally well any others available .	1
i bought this memento brilliant but modest necklace i seen smithsonian institute . i love grand central stone well modern multi-strands this design - this combination truly illuminates my evening wear . far , intricate detail present reminds me jewelery owned ladies royal court . so much class it still affordable . this necklace exceptional gem .	1
real earrings look much better than picture . substantial presence nice quality jewellery	1
overall , this watch good : large numbers fairly standard set basic features ( date , alarm , stop watch ) crown seems fairly resistant scratching indiglo lighting greatcontrary description , however , chronograph not lap capability ; it only split function ( 2 way ) . reminder , it not countdown timer , which seems common theme many timex watches	1
swarovski making crystal jewelry since 1892 , their consistent quality kept company going through wars rise fall empires . these excellent earrings made sterling silver swarovski crystals , quite attractive . if you looking some nice , crystal silver earrings , then these ones get . way , they look great when combined heart , star starburst crystal tattoos - which i also highly recommend !	1

when i recevied my watch , i so excited ! it looked so cool picture ever so when i got it . harry face it neat case comes wit it so detailed ! can't wait 2 sport it when movie last final book arrives !!!	1
i love knowing exact time ( even if my mom thinks i am crazy ) , it works like ... clock ! i never issues updates ( illinois ) , but i few minor issues : watch too thick ( 5/8 inch ) , band made gorilla very difficult adjust human , buttons hard press , manual too small hard read . still , if i choice this watch or my borhter rolex , i take his rolex exchange it 40 casios . thank you , casio	1
great deal gift . if you want something different good price .	1
i wear this watch every day i usually work outside . i am very pleased features durability . it seemed daunting work features forst , but short time instruction book made them accessable easy . i only two complaints : one metal band developed slight " squeak " when i move my wrist sometimes . tin man needs oil . second despite placed huge window every night , watch not always get time signal ft . collins . i gone long several days without getting it - but when you consider most watches not get it all , i am ok spotty reception	1
strap/links these g-shocks quite oversized : when i first got it , i could fit watch around my legs ! ( you'll most likely get links adjusted ) . ironically , four side buttons watch small . so even if you huge wrist , you'll probably trouble pressing buttons ! ( not huge fingers ) *** beware *** picture shows four side buttons watch silver , but left right side buttons this model actually plain black ! it quite misleading ! silver side button actually mtg920dj model ( which 2005 version ) . according casio , mtg920da actually released 2004 black side buttons . if you search casio website , it only display mtg920dj ( their most recent version ); most websites still sell mtg920da just taking latest mtg920dj version picture casio website . mtg920dj seems same features this one ( mtg920da ) , except four side ( left right ) buttons silver . those you wondering three circles watch : first one very left basically wannabe-analog display - basically , every five minutes , bar increases ( or decreases when it gets full ); it just mostly there cosmetic reasons . second one middle battery status ; it ( low ) , ( medium ) , ( high ) bar would display one those areas . if you get out sun lot or know area your home where sun shines lot , then you won't problem battery ever going below high . moreover , it power saving feature ; watch go into sleep mode ( display off ) when it completely dark area long time . finally , third circle very right where it tells you what options enabled/disabled . it shows spl ( split time stopwatch ) , dst ( daylight saving time ) , sig ( hourly signal ) , alm ( alarm ) , snz ( snooze ) , auto el ( automatic electro-luminescent backlight - backlight turns tilting it certain degree towards your face without manually press backlight button . ) keep mind , synchronizing atomic signal not instant : it usually takes around 3 minutes ( least me , i live california . ) if you're busy area or near electronic , it might difficult ; try again or move different area . moreover , it should show you strength/level ( 4 levels ) signal ( while you're synchronizing ) satellite icon watch . there also feature automatically synchornizes you while you're sleeping 2:00 am , 3:00 am , 4:00 am , 5:00 am . therefore , it not always necessary syncronize it yourself because time you wake up , it should ready go . overall , this watch attractive fun wear . atomic radio signal feature very cool ; official time great - right precise second ! i've this watch months now , i enjoy wearing it daily . this watch lot feature - except , it pity it *** not *** countdown timer ! pros : - cool design - water/scratch resistant ; g-shock known their toughest watches . ( update : i've worn this watch daily almost year half now not single scratch - still looks brand new ! )- solar power ; battery life excellent ; never power ever go below high . power saving feature . - position time date easy read one glance . - metal strap - display world time local time cons : - side buttons small tight press ( must use like very tip fingers ) - atomic signal takes too long manually , it usually not possible synchronize while wearing watch ; if you're inside home , it usually best take off watch leave it near window . - alarm beep little longer perhaps ( even my inexpensive timex watch would beep it would gradually beep faster , which i actually like bit better . ) - no countdown timer . ( how could they forget this ?! ) also , try research other models instead finding out hard way ( like i side buttons ) before purchasing .	1
i recently purchased this product christmas gift someone very close me . needless say recipient simply loved it . i recommend this article everyone without hesitatation	1
when i ordered these , i little nervous . however , once i recieved them i rather impressed ! these perfect small ears i love how backs earrings screw-ons they not dig into ear or behind ear ( which problem i run into my daughter who 5 ) . she loves these earrings ! picture amazon horrible , these quite pretty nice . i would definately order more !	1

i thought 7mm might too big but they just perfect size . i haven't taken them off since i got them . great price	1
i looking money clip thin light . i wanted hinge so i didn't bend it every time thickness my wad cash changed significant percentage . i dislike gaudiness much cheesy or cheap appearance . this money clip meets exceeds all i asked , except it looks bit cheap , others commented . it also scratches easily , but i knew this prior purchase decision since i've owned other titanium products . i would given this solid 5 stars if manufacturer made it wider using thicker material rounded corners evenly , but i'm not sure if i would paid higher price . those you who using your finger nails open hinge , i recommend you hold bills open hinge . you leverage open it easily without risking cut . yes , it sharp .	1
several years ago , i given one those so-called front pocket wallets gift . it clip exact same mechanism this clip riveted it . i loved clip , didn't like wallet . too bulky my front pocket . so i ripped clip off wallet . i loved clip until it broke after 4 years everyday use . anyway , searching replacement i found i could spend around 20 bucks front pocket wallet rip clip off it again or i could spend around 20 bucks this clip . i love this clip . its extremely lightweight , strong durable . it keeps my cash neatly organized doesn't pull my pants down . my only complaint corners tad pointy . manufacturer would well soften them bit	1
i purchased these earrings first birthday gift my daughter . we printed out page went local fred meyer jewelers mall see earrings first hand before we purchased . we absolutely loved earrings , however they full price , so decided save $80 purchase them online . they arrived within two days ordering , but when we opened box , diamonds yellow , not clear sparkly pictured site , or mall . still lovely , good price , but i think thast these seconds or lower quality than earrings one purchase physical store	1
i truly expecting something small lightweight arrive . not so ! this piece large , heavy weight very durable ! well worth money	1
it only friendship ying yang necklace i could find anywhere . it perfect , exactly what i envisioned . fast shipping . shipping bit expensive , though , considering price item , but because item itself reasonably priced , i got over it . other problem i shipping , i don't know if it merchant , or amazon , it indicated number days standard shipping would get it me well before christmas , but when i clicked standard shipping it gave me notice i wouldn't get it before christmas i choose expedited order get it christmas . not make me happy .	1

i recieved this watch gift several months ago . watch very nice looking , much better looking person . mine hasn't any issues timekeeping , it very accurate . i haven't experienced problems others . face watch nearly impossible scratch . there several times where i've accidently rubbed face against wall or other surface only find no damage , much my surprise . other watches i've scratch within first week . i've this watch 6 months no face scratches ( although around face band show many scratches , not nearly annoying scratch right face ) . i'm serious , i like party face still scratchless . this very surprising me . chronograph functions almost entirely useless , but who cares . stopwatch without fractions second not worth using , but this watch features more looks , they look great . i don't find this big deal since i would rather not digital functions my watch , they look tacky my opinion . also my cell phone great stop watch funtion which i use 12 ounce beer chug time trials making this complaint almost inconsiquential . movement watch leaves little desired . japaneese movement somewhat jumpy . this price you really can't expect automatic movement however . this really biggest weak point watch if you bunch cash burning hole your pocket , maybe you should get swiss automatic movement watch . this somewhat minor issue given almost all watches this price range use japanees movements no normal person ever know difference . this watch same price cheap fossil watch but when you see it person it feels looks much more expensive . fit finish much more than you would expect $115 . i find it great value . box it comes so nice you don't want throw it away , i still mine . i wear this watch every day i still recieve compliments it	1

i wanted i watch i could forget i wearing . this watch fits bill . it very very light weight , band comfortable . i've multiple watches over course my life , but this one i put start day only take off end day , comfortable light . it also looks great . sophisticated looking , worn both casual dress events . great everyday watch ! highly recommended	1
my husband loves fossil watches , got this one his birthday not disappointed . looks nice , worn everyday or nice evening out	1
i mine two days now . it what i expected : lightweight , minimalist , stylish watch . mine quiet , i hear it ticking only when held tight my ear . clasp takes some getting used instruction could clearer , but once one gets it figured out it works fine , including adjusting it . it somewhat difficult read low light , but hands while small very reflective so changing viewing angle bit usually bring them into clear view .	1
i agree most other posters here watch aesthetics-it really sleek watch goes well casual or more formal clothing . i'm writing review mainly address " loud clicking " some people seem experiencing . it really quiet watch i can't hear it totally quiet room-except when i hold it particular position . if you wear your watch your arm face back your hand then point ceiling , it'll sometimes make clicking noise surprisingly loud . it odd position though it only very particular position , so it doesn't all detract my overall impression this watch . edit : i've spent more time this watch i must say it looks awesome everything jeans suit . thing i'd add it only " noisy " when watch face isn't contact anything- e.g. when you it upside down your wrist there gap , or when you leave it sideways table . some positions it actually get quite loud , but i never maintain one those long enough figure out how replicate it	1
beautiful watch . it little heavy compared your other watches since its all stainless steel . your basic functions including alarm , date , 24h time , stop watch . it also night blue backlight . its little bigger then picture would make it seem	1
this watch larger than i expected . i 20 year old seiko looks exactly like this one but only 3/4 size this one . what i expected . this , however , nice watch kept perfect time . i would buy it again	1

i purchase this item gift my mother she loved it . she stated it sparked glimmered like real diamonds . also , i ordered product late my mother still received product time	1
i , too , am disappointed misinformation amazon originally posted regards watch solar-powered , but even without feature it still great watch . now , those you who whining not able adjust metal band this wonderful watch , it very easy . if you look inside band , some links small arrow stamped them . just put very small screwdriver into one holes " arrow " side one those links push . same next " arrow " link . remove both pins loose link . ( course , you may remove more than one link ! ) then connect band back together slide one pins into " non-arrow " side secure it . make sure slotted/pinched side pin goes last . push pin slightly match other links . hope this helps you appreciate this great watch little more	1
i pleasantly suprised when i opened box found this watch looks even better person . i own swiss army watch costing 3 times much , find most watches this price range feel light flimsy compared it . until i opened box my fossil , this heavy solid feeling watch . this watch not men skinny wrists . i liked this watch so much i looked other fossil watches can't decide witch one i buy next	1

i love fossily watches . my only beef fossil all their metal watches heavy like bricks . downside this particular model quartz covers face . cover bows out like contact lens . this causes watch lens scratch if you lay it down its face frequently . if you're careful , this won't problem - but it too late me . : -	1

this my first time purchased amazon . product i purchased what i expected . however , i must say amazon extremely needs improve customer service organizational skill . watch i purchased not include any sale receipt . there no warranty information included . most all , no instruction manual came watch . box watch torn ripped apart . this not mention i defective watch shipped me before . obviously i overrated amazon before my purchase . after this experience , i felt though i made purchase on-line through " mom pop " business versus fortune 500 company . i don't think it would take rocket scientist figure out if i make any future purchase amazon	1
i bought two pair these earrings april 2005 $10 each , one me one granddaughter . now amazon running them $9 friday sale . it not too soon thinking christmas stocking stuffers . these would perfect . these real gold , quality earrings . i love mine worn them now almost two years no problems , careful metal allergies . what you waiting	1

this good watch own . i like it size . large bezel great i no overall complaints watch . it gets people talking due either it size -- or orange face .	1
after reading some reviews , i concerned product might not come described . however , my package arrived exactly described description . my tool arrived wooden box , padding slots hold all inserts . tool comes more sets inserts than i expected , also . there aren't really any instructions it , but i no problems figuring it out . i am not watch repair expert , i just needed replace some batteries . i successfully using it within 3 minutes opening it	1
i can't give it 5 stars , it not perfect . i lot watch tools , this nice one . case nice , it works it should . but , again , it not perfect . pins don't stay , making it harder use ( you use it upside down , pins don't lock ) . there should instructions those who don't know exactly how use it . little half-sheet included all but useless . but it great deal price . easily opens notch-back cases i use it	1
i bought these my girls so they watch all times when they go park . they ages 8 9 . these worked out great i plenty replace lost watches .	1
i removed links my new seiko band . no problem . i see how doofus might need extra parts , while they learning proper technique . press down firmly band your thumb prevent it moving while you turn knob your other hand . base under band spring-loaded strong spring . if you allow band move while you pushing pin out , you may break off part that doing pushing . get band pin lined up exactly before proceeding - or - you may break little pusher part . good luck - it good tool .	1
i recieved this today i say i'm very pleased . it nice victorian gothic look it . it go perfect chain i	1
i am impressed how easy this machine use . directions straight forward , machine ready use almost immediately after plugging it . some reviewers said this huge machine , but i didn't think it big all . it cleaned my diamond rings other jewelry really well . it even shined my gold bands become quite dull ( i didn't even notice how dull they until jewel jet made them shiny again i trying clean diamond my ring ) . overall , i think this great product , i enjoy fact i no longer take my jewelry anywhere cleaned .	1
these earrings beautiful sturdy but bit smaller than i expected . they still good deal good weight good clasps . i looked department stores not find anything like these or this quality either store . i also looked other websites would pay more similar earrings	1

i think pendant nice , although it bit delicate kids	1
first thing note timex web site claims three-year battery life , while amazon claims eight years . i hope amazon right , but you should know what manufacturer thinks ;) my wife chose this watch because its looks , i must admit it looks rather nice . this definately no-frills . no compass , no alarm , no stopwatch . but it tells time date . besides looking sharp , my favorite thing size/weight -- it rather thin light . i wanted watch more features , but i could not stand thought something larger heavier . there really not much complain . date display rather small . band also advertised " water resistant leather " but i would not want take it swimming . only time tell how it hold up . i also not know why watch manufacturers continue use cheap zinc glow powder hands . newer strontium-based powders available still glow great after eight hours . oh well , all manufacturers this , it light up entire face so glow powder really not even needed . so , summarize , it small light metal men watch , it looks great . guys , one look this ladies know you man who comfortable deep woods	1
this one very first pieces celtic jewelry i purchased . i am extremely pleased quality detail this pendant , many comments it . very nice piece !!!	1

i very pleased my purchase it arrived time . i purchasing again	1
my sister loved this neckalace . i thought pendant would little smaller , but overall still pretty	1
i shopping new watch , i certain number criteria mind . 1 . it must affordable2 . it must recognized brand ( quality purposes)3 . it must stylish without too fad-ish4 . it must multi-purpose lend itself almost all styles dress , it casual or formal . i found all this this little seiko watch . first , i setting my sights no-battery type design , but after reading both kinetic solar watches ... finding out both require replacement either lithium ion battery or capacitor , neither which guaranteed last longer than regular battery operated watch ... i decided stick regular quartz . watch itself looks better than its picture . dial listed white website , but it actually silver tone ... similar what you see rolex brands ( which it supposed mimic ) . gold nice shine it , particular sparkle coming marked hours pie-cut bezel around watch face . there luminous material watch hands hour markers , but very minimal amount . my guess they didn't want detract shiny finish , but you lose some ability see watch face night . there enough see watch hands ... just barely ... but hours really hard make out dark . oh well , if checking time night real issue then i suggest looking some timex indiglos . *** revision *** while it hard see luminous hands markers first , they get brighter once your eyes adjust dark . i found myself waking up early this morning could clearly see all marked hours hands my watch face no problems . this watch also comes day date calendar . some said it hard work , but i actually found it really easy . instructions very easy follow i calendar time set up 2 minutes . this watch surprisingly lightweight very comfortable wear . catch opens without breaking any nails off band very roomy . i medium large sized wrist wear my watch slightly loose " bracelet " style , but i still get couple links taken out . my verdict : good watch good price . it goes everything my closet company that known excellence durablility . five stars	1
i not own this version , but invicta , well other watches screw down crowns . what this means you cannot pull out crown without unscrewing it , which counter clockwise . it then pop out . then you push crown screw it clockwise gentle inward pressure screw it down . there some discussion proper care while using crown web . apparently this area where you greatest potential damage your watch , any watch . so gentle , especially when setting time , date , etc . most watches you shouldn't this near midnight . perhaps search web . invicta instruction booklets completely generic , so it not surprising some people might confused	1
only reason i rated this 4 stars you can't really see hour minute hands dark . i know description says hands luminescent but they really aren't . other than , watch looks great - right balance sporty class	1
i bought these my twenty-something sister-in-law ... she loved them put them right away . they small , so aware ; she tiny delicate features , usually only wears stud earrings , so they perfect her . these would too small someone who usually wears larger or flashier earrings . there bit space stones metal doesn't really show pictures , but it nothing you notice once they . all , great value	1
i received this gift find necklace absolutely georgous ! goes everything i get lots compliments . i wish they earrings match !!! i don't know what moonstone but it really pretty .	1
i love them they small enough everyday wear , people coment them often how they like smaller size how they nice shine them . i also usally problems my ears hurting or getting sore after wearing some earring but not these this type metal defently worth price	1
several days research came this conclusion ... watch i looking , i would pay somewhere around $1000 up or i could get seiko . it " no brainer " me leas t.t itanium only thing missing my list perfect watch . owning seiko titanium kinetic ( 10 yrs . ) , i tell you importance sapphire crystal . band wore down before face ( i tend little rough watches . )	1

fine looking , elegant , " sporty " watch , very light comfortable . my only complaint sub-dials - numbers/letters so tiny just useless , especially date dial , 31 numbers crowded . said , though - i like it lot , i wear it lot . my recommendation : check out any watch " live person " before you buy it online .	1

i am extremely impressed feel , look general quality watch . it contains citizen miyota 21 jewel automatic movement true workhorse fraction price . comfortable stainess steel pinned link bracelet worth price watch . it rounded flexible brushed steel wrist links foldover adjustable double safety clasp uses pins well . easily mistaken watch costing much more . mineral glass crystal scratch resistant - but not good sapphire watch face , but less prone chipping or shattering than sapphire crystal . display watchback also mineral glass - displaying undecorated miyota automatic movement . it look stylish run well my other watches , , i receive many comments if not more invicta . it great looking watch ! good value , accurate stylish if you like sub ' look . this good day-to-day knock watch still looks better than quartz stuff same price range . if it lasts 5 years it more than paid itself . if you would like more information talk others invicta or other watches visit www.thewatchcentral.com . all questions comments responded	1

it get 4 stars because , well what would you expect , slide rule accurate 2 decimal places . it could given you 3 . oh well . if you using your watch calculate your arrival time you probably don't really care if you off few minutes . ok , why circular slide rule cool ? first , lots common calculations really just ratios . kilometers miles or statue miles nautical miles , pounds kilograms . this watch markers slide rule , so you just align one mark number you want convert look number other unit measure over there you . you keep track magnitude answer but that not hard . you sq roots but it pain . basic multiplication division easy . doing approximation tip restraunt , just set percentage over " 10 " mark , look you bill inside ring , read tip outside ring . no need even adjust watch . you easily set it up before dinner . note : if you stare your watch while trying read tip value , you may get called " rude " your date ! better just overestimate ... downside , if you not perfect vision , you'll hard time reading sliderule . don't even think doing this while you driving . my eyes fine it good light . other hand , time hands numerals plenty large enough easy read . luminescent marks seem stay bright hour , which good enough us casual night hawks . otherwise you need watch tritium who knows whether pass airport security these days . one other thing 24 hr inner hand easily obscured main watch hands . so this feature not very handy second timezone clock . it help you remember military time , but say 11:00 you can't see underlying hand . not big thing , i suppose if you set say 8 or 9 hours difference it might more visible . all all , cool watch , even if slide rule control built lefty	1

this watch quite nice makes fashion statement any arm . however , band leaves little bit desired . while it attractive band , it not functional expected . it not wrap around arm securely without turning bit sideways showing bit end band . while this not severe problem , it not 100% acceptable	1
there alot complaints amazon similar pieces . it very small but no smaller than 14mm add states . i like it small because cameos tend bit gawdy . i not get one diamonds , just plain silver my mother gift valentine day . agate slightly raised setting but not appear problem , design intricate nice . ring pendant could little stronger but i think it ok . chain very nice strong . it arrived time i live japan . we love everything angels them , we even pet or mutt named angel . :-) i paid $34.00 plus $5.00 shipping handling i am ok	1
... price , i loved ' em too . great surprise gift . hopefully , they'll hold up over time	1
i love my bulova watch . i looking women watch would stand out little more than average watch this one it sure ! it looks great just enough sparkle without too much . it larger watch than many women but detail design make it look very feminine . i small wrist , so i remove four links it , but it looks great not overpowering . i don't think i taken it off since it arrived ! price - i looking this watch 3 months . amazon hundreds cheaper than everyone else . many places selling if $369 $499 .	1

originally written orange monster , this review holds equally true black version . moment you first hold this watch your hand , you realize it quality timepiece . first thing strikes you its large size heavy feel , yet despite , it feels comfortable wrist due its fine balance . bracelet : bracelet end links ( those attach watch case ) solid rather than formed sheet metal like you find most other watches this price range . pins holding bracelet watch sturdiest i ever seen . each bracelet subsequent links also made solid piece steel , not folded sheet , each component feather-edged prevent it digging into wrist . its removable link pins unusual machined pin collar design which , though fiddly remove replace , nevertheless ensure pins remain under-flush secure when correctly installed . bracelet perfectly flush side contacts your wrist making it feel very smooth during wear . clasp very high quality , both fold over security buckle , which deploys satisfying click , omega style double button catch . security buckle closes onto spring pin whose ends spherical thus ensuring tight fastening which should not wear use . all all these features add up watch very quiet wrist , only faint sound coming its automatic winding mechanism . finally bracelet incorporates clever hidden diver extension ( allow watch worn over wet suit ) . case : watch case , back bezel made stainless steel . case attractive mix polished , brushed machined finishes which all add feel quality function . overall impression this precision instrument rather than fashion piece ; that not say though it would look out place dinner jacket any more than wet sui t.t he unidirectional bezel heavily scalloped design , protected bezel-guards which extend upwards each lug pairs . lower guard also functions crown guard , all all , impression case machined solid billet steel . bezel sits slightly higher than domed crystal , thus providing protection scratching crystal itself proprietary seiko material " hardlex " which , i understand it , better resisting scratches than mineral glass but less susceptible shattering than sapphire . luminosity this watch astounding due partly use seiko proprietary " lumibrite " paint but also large coated areas hour markers hands . bezel only turns one way , safety feature timing dives , feels silky smooth , best i've experienced any seiko or invicta diver . it 120 clicks per revolution nicely aligned face . movement : watch uses 21 jewel seiko 7s26 movement running 21,600 bph ( 5 ticks per second ) . it non-hacking which means second hand not stop when crown pulled out . although this makes it difficult synchronize , if slight backward pressure applied fully extended crown , it possible stop second hand . watch not hand wound but self winding mechanism very efficient i found it power reserve least 24 hours . 7s26 around many years reputation ruggedness reliability . accuracy : there several reviews where people complain poor accuracy . typically , when new , automatic movements set run fast factory because they tend slow down after few weeks use . i own three watches 7s26 movement after their breaking period all now keeping time within 10 seconds per day . i few thoughts accuracy . you ask yourself how accurate your watch need ? if it running 10 or 20 seconds fast per day then set it one minute slow you only need re-set it once every week or two when it advanced one minute fast . if you need more accuracy then , unless you willing pay least five times much swiss watch , then buy quartz . finally , if you search seiko monster you'll quickly come realize its various colours , these watches firm favourites amongst those who members internet watch forums . i would highly recommend you purchase one see yourself	1
i ordered 3 pairs 1 carat earrings i absoulutely loved them . price outstanding well . i am sure i continue business there	1
really nice ring , it really good good pric	1
this pendant very pretty , but it not quite what i expected . dimensions given 3/4 inch high wide , but i picturing it bit larger . i also thought chain would more robust , but it very fine . it packaged cheap felt bag inside cardboard box . these not bad things , i like necklace , but i thought i'd put down my misconceptions help others make decision . overall product seems very good quality	1
