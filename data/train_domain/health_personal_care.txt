i offered one these while cycling thought it very tasty . so good , fact , when i got home i went straight web site show back wrapper learn where i could buy them . just above web address nutrition ingredients list . probably mistake manufacturer part it gives you something read while site comes up . oops ! this bar whooping 25% your daily allowance saturated fat ! not only , but fat palm oil . this might acceptable soldier involved prolonged strenuous activity but i doubt cardiologist would recomend it most us . commercially formulated product more likely fill average person need lower fat ( healthier fat ) energy bar , than one formulated extreme physical activity , sold profit marketed patriotic tribute troops . bottom line : read label , weigh health risks if you want support troops , there better way than eating hooah bars .	-1

i bought two boxes these luv diapers ( thats 448 diapers ! ) i sure wish i spent little extra pampers swaddlers . these diapers leak out top because they don't any elastic tabs or anywhere waist . even generic kroger diapers elastic waistbands ! i am just sad i use these crappy diapers so long ! i also think they run small so i probably not even use them all . what waste ! only good thing these diapers price , but , i would highly recommend you just buy your store brand instead if money issue . p.s. i don't like huggies either because they leak out legs ! hard find good diaper	-1
i suppose it serves function people bad eyesight or something . but ...... dear god thing ugly	-1
i happy see this type product available , but not happy when i received it . it seems like flimsy piece plastic , " magnets " looked like they painted , gold-tone , paint looked like it chipping off . base item separate top item , which seems attached springs ? it run , but very loud , like it working too hard . there note not use it more than 20 minutes , which i'm not sure because potential adverse affect user , or because unit might overheat . there some spelling errors outside box ( few places said " reflexology " few places said " relexology " ) -- but maybe just bothers me ? i think it also important note buyer pays shipping , if returned -- also pays return shipping charges ; when combined , nearly equals original cost item . ;o (	-1
i really wanted like this product after reading all their hype how quick easy it . not . motor it heats up quickly thing stops working . you wait 20 minutes it cool down it start up again . but time you getting results one area your foot , thing heats up stops working again . i went through four intervals effective operation , heat build-up causing it quit , waiting long time it cool off before starting up again . finally i decided it isn't worth time aggravation , even though it produced good results during intermittent periods when it worked . one more thing -- when i gave up decided return it , i took my duracell batteries out they blazingly hot . i worry it might possible batteries explode hot-running motor . i've never seen batteries get scalding hot like this . update : found something much betterafter returninng artemis , i tried medicool pedisenso professional pedicure appliance . this one costs 5 times price artemis but soooo much better it well worth it . medicool plug-in electric much more power than battery operated artemis . it variable speeds , 5 different sapphire filing attachments , enough power operate long you need . sapphire files different shapes sizes should last lifetime , whereas artemis requires repeated purchases its disposable filing heads batteries . so over time costs owning artemis add up -- if overly hot motor not burn out . if you serious callouses corns , like i , medicool pedisenso very serious , rewarding job . i'm so glad i found it i am grateful relief it provides	-1

before you buy , sure check where pen made . i number older cross pens say " usa " near top , they great pens . however , i bought three different ones past few years not indicate where they made , they inferior quality . top bottom halves loose , carefully manipulated come together without gap . first one i got , i sent it back cross warranty repair under their " lifetime guarantee , " only receive it back unchanged telling me it just fine - " handling fee " attached . i willing believe it simply anomaly , one bad pen . so later when some new colors came out , i bought two more - only see they same quality defect . my advice : if you want good cross pen , go secondhand store buy one made usa . they aren't making them same anymore .	-1

i thought this hot air brush would make things easier not hold round brush blow dryer . it great idea , but it just doesn't work well . first let me say i shoulder length , normal hair , but lot it . if i air dry , it slightly wavy . i used larger two brushes found it couldn't get through my hair . so then i using second hand try push hair against brush so it would curl around it . didn't work very well , i wound up burning my hands more than once . i also found i couldn't get same nice curl this hot air brush i could get using regular round brush dryer . other major problem brush got extremely hot . if you idea you'll able change larger brush size smaller ( or unit without attachment ) or vice versa , you won't without getting burned . attachment -- even end blow dryer itself -- simply too hot touch . i doing things like using hand towel try change attachments . size shape unit also not optimal . i found it too large awkward use . off button located right where your hand , so it easy bump . also , there no cold shot . if you've come appreciate what setting curl , you'll probably miss it like i . additionally , person mentioned , unit very loud . you would wise buy couple foam ear plugs if you determined keep this brush keep your hearing . i don't believe i read any warning noise , either . it much louder than my traditional guy-style blow dryer . time wise , i found i spent much longer trying get my hair dry , then i wasn't fully satisfied style well burns hassle involved getting there . i gave this try few days then returned it store refund . it made me appreciate traditional blow dryer round brush . some things just not good they seem .	-1

this review covers fb11nr : same unit slightly different control pushbuttons ir remote . somehow , i deluded myself into thinking spinning massagers under each foot powered . nope ... basically just built-in plastic versions those usually wooden massaging rollers one rolls one foot upon . that fine , yet when i want relax , i'm not thinking moving my feet . fortunately , those removable , removal exactly what happened . killer center massage wheel , which supposed powered supposed spin , d.o.a. this unit went back store , we bought fb21 instead . amazon no listing model , so i can't give full review it . it good enough keep . both fb11nr fb21 share some traits . neither one really keeps water anywhere near its original temperature . sound levels vary fairly quiet quite loud , depending upon operating mode chosen ( i db measurements fb21 , but since amazon doesn't list one , you don't get see them ) . fb21 seems slightly better build quality , everything worked out box , so we kept one	-1

idea fantastic . fact i don't wake up immediately like bzzzz--i'm awake . amazingly i hit snooze regular alarm without ever knowing it . this alarm , light starts glowing gets brighter brighter over period time you select . i mine set 15 minutes , usually time light reached maximum i'm coherent enough get up . if light doesn't it , you add sounds ranging buzzer screeching sea gulls -- ocean , wind , ringing bells falling somewhere . flaws : others mentioned , light itself makes buzzing noise low light levels . so when it first pops morning , you also get annoying filiment vibration lamp . secondly , you don't set alarm when you want get up . you go through some math calculations , figuring out when you want wake up how long it take you get point . then you set alarm earlier time ( awake minus groggy equals alarm time ) . third , if you use sound addition light , it increase volume light increases intensity , but sound starts out so loud begin light really pointless . workaround we've found this use external speaker provided . plug it into back light , run it across room , bury it upside down under some pillows . then pick sound like " birds " instead lip-curling " harbor " or " town " . it buried location across room , sound hits right volume time light maxes out . whoever came up plan making sound come light just not thinking . fourth , clock lumination change colors , rotating through entire rainbow all night long its default setting . first looks cool . until you realize bright yellow clock glowing your face 2 a.m. just wrong . darkest setting red , only way choose it hit pause button back when it rotates around color . so yes , it works . it wakes me up without making me use my hammer . but design just plain stupid . if manufacturer would wander here , read this make few design changes , they could make light worth buying	-1

i pretty excited try ion hairdryer . i got this one because i liked idea able ' control ' amount ions coming out . my hair seem little shinier after using it ( only reason i gave it two stars not one ) but my hair felt little drier . almost straw-ish ... it never felt like my old drier . also buttons really hard switch ... all them ! i read review said i thought well how bad it ? i dry my hair round brush my right hand dryer left . i turn dryer off during different times while i am doing my hair . this dryer i could not turn on/off switch my left hand . i put down my brush use both hands . i could not believe how hard it switch ! this main deciding factor returning dryer , it so frustrating not able switch it easily flick your thumb . not mention made me feel like big wussy !!! speed setting only two settings , low high . low setting way too low high setting way too high . middle ground would nice . lastly , dryer smelled little weird . granted , i only it two days before i returned it , so smell might eventually disappear . but it wasn't your normal ' new hairdryer , hot plastic ' smell . it almost slight mildew smell . yuk . so , i would not recommend getting it . i exchanged it vidal sassoon ion sensor dryer . seems working better . low speed setting perfect . smell normal ' new dryer ' smell so far . buttons easy push !!!! sensor ( it automatically turns off when you pur it down ) little off , it takes while turn off . but all all i like it . it also make my hair shiny not make it feel drier or like straw !	-1

this thing comes lots attachments , which i regularly used only 2 . vibrating cuticle pusher silly . far all those round discs , it hard explain physics this , but suffice it say since it rotating circle , you only use half it time or you'll experience bump-bump-bump . thing rotates such speed ( even lowest two speeds ) even leaving your toe or finger moment or two create burning sensation . what i use smallest pointed attachment , which i used lightly go around my nail close cuticle . this good when you're wearing clear nail polish your nails starting grow out . you lightly buff down ridge polish . same goes edge where acrylic meets natural nail . other attachment i used , though less frequently , bigger cone-shaped one ( kind looks like shape foam ear plug ) . i used lightly go over my largest toenails thin them down since i trouble ingrown toenails . again , it challenge not create burn when doing so . nail dryer thing silly useless . if you manage cram your hand into little scoop without smudging polish , it doesn't much anyway dry your nails any faster than just letting them set . buy little fan like they use shops if you want faster drying time . this thing isn't gonna it . other folks mentioned this thing ruined their nails . it likely because they tried use all attachments ( which you'd think you should able , right ? ) . much regular buffing your nail thins it down weakens it too much . bump-bump-bump round attachments likely doesn't help , either . couple times i used this acrylic nails . i tendency wear acrylic nails few weeks then hate them want them removed --- i'm no longer willing subject myself soak-and-pry method nail salons . so alternative soak home , or just trim down myself then thin them more natural curved shape until rest acrylic grew out . however , i mention i this only couple times . that because apparently acrylics bit too much challenge this little " deluxe manicure system . " after sounding like it ailing while it filed down length 2 acrylic nails , it gave little bzz then died . i waited while see if maybe it overheated . i tried other outlets . nope , dead . so i'd pronounce this unfit natural or acrylic nails . if you want something quality acrylic nails , invest dremel tools salons use ( just sure get one low rpm or foot pedal attachment ) . if you want something quality natural nails , go drug store get some sandpaper nail files , rectangular buffer , cuticle pusher . sometimes best solution simplest .	-1

i first bought standard , then large size attempt pair fit well . i used them riding bike winter months . neither pair fit well there most likely very few people who obtain good fit . goggles snug enough prevent wind entering ( prevent tearing ) causes great pressure above ear . rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely . i retired my clics when i found foam padded sunglasses motorcyclists .	-1

i finally received this product mail after knowing it year . i can't say i'm huge fan deepak chopra . he presents some good ideas , but what i tell he seems consider meditation more mechanism mind body control , leading bliss relaxation , rather than tool unbiased self knowledge , come terms all things one rather might ignore . i find this bias reflected game . game itself , it pretty good - its graphics its originality - learning relax chill out may useful some people . i didn't find process compelling i expected , though . i found i able learn some skills pretty fast , other places i seemed get stuck . one potential drawback if you get frustrated , try start forcing things happen , it defeat purpose meditation . science biofeedback fairly new , i see its potential field preventative health . i just wouldn't put same new age spin things chopra .	1

now i'm writing this review , it seems silly i'm so happy over such small thing toothbrush . but i am . i bought this item not long after i my first ( hopefully only ) root canal crown four years ago , something which i never again want experience my life ( someone else described , it painful expensive ) . growing up , i didn't take care my teeth like i should've , so i'm accustomed always told there either cavity , or start one , more work . after root canal , my mom recommended brush least certain number pulsations/oscillations , because that what she'd recommended her dentist combat her receding gums . this specific item met those requirements , it affordable . when i first started using it , my gums very sensitive it , but quickly wore off , so it seems me it strengthens gums . it also much easier get behind front teeth . subsequent dentist vists my mom shown her gums improved dramatically after using high-quality electric toothbrush such this one ( i honestly don't remember if she this exact model , but ours similar ) , i've not needed any work dentist beyond regular cleanings since i purchased it . far cleaning unit keep it " gunking " up , i'm only person who uses this item , so any extra toothbrush heads still package they came , not dripping into storage container ; so i don't know how combat . but i just take toothbrush head off thing rinse it , then rinse hand-held part , set them back unplugged charger/base ( i only plug it when battery runs low ) things stay clean no problem	1

bad news first : doesn't seem work well without adding extra detergent it seems like this not 3x concentration , like others we found we compensate adding more detergent than directions said get same results we standard formula . otherwise , two products , ' concentrated ' ' standard srength ' same . make no mistake it - this concentrated comes out like heinz ketchup : it seem concentrated , we notice certain amount difficulty getting detergent out bottle , kind reminded us heinz ketchup . 4-star or 5-star product ? standard strength product clearly 5-star product , however owing fact this product not work well without adding more detergent than direction claim , it rates 4-stars our family . trying learn objective info laundry detergent well . . . . following true this product standard strength or 3x extra detergent added : i am allergic most laundry detergents , but this product prevented severe discomfort me 10 years . it consistently among lowest-priced detergents available . addition very easy clothes skin , it work quite well stain-removal department used its own presoak . this good know if you like me trying avoid allergens . it important remember if you buy hypoallergenic powder detergent instead liquid like this , you may pre-soak stains you won't hypoallergenic liquid which it . while " tide " " cheer " also available hypoallergenic formulas , [ " tide free " actually just unscented ] they considerably more expensive work no better my experience . that why i like this " all liquid detergent - free clear , laundry detergent " . objective information tough find ! i actually conduct hard target search true , objective information laundry detergents . there very little beyond which brand causes pollution which , while important , not what i trying find . " consumer reports " test comparisons most popular brands its monthly magazine every couple years they include some detail . " all website " if you looking this product website it under " unilever " you specify " usa " under products , word " all " show up almost every search result . you find " wisk " " breyer ice cream " almost many neat name brand products you would procter gamble site .

this unit power transformer wall socket end instead handheld part . handheld part mostly made plastic . so , it pleasantly light hold , much lighter than my wahl homecare thing . supplied guard things ( you swap change length , etc . ; iirc they range 1/8 " 1 " ) curve bottom so it easier them glide over concave surfaces instead digging pointed end into them . this also makes things more pleasant . don't believe no-mess story , though . it really catch most hair , so it certainly worthwhile , it easy empty hair trap , but i still vacuum remainder afterwards . it doesn't catch it all	1

... i purchased this item remove some debris off my camcorder lens found it job very nicely . microfiber texture feels nice - little beady , but soft textured . using it easy , i just wiped lens circular fashion light pressure eventually debris gone . ( some fingerprints what appeared scratch but wasn't)the packaging little subpar though . it comes plastic bag which you tear open bottom slide cloth out . however doing so leaves adhesive residue , which cloth then sticks you tear it off , making those sections cloth appear phyically different - bit roughed up i'd say . this poor design packaging says store cloth inside bag when not use avoid contamination , so i used scissor cut bottom bag adhesive residue off . i've yet machine wash it , but so far it works well . it just cheap lens cleaning cloth after all	1

i purchased caruso my wife after returning conair infinity . conair infinity not measure up her expectations . she happy caruso feels it good job setting curl . i offer few observations my own . i would think companies produce these devices would more sensative needs broader spectum customer . instance , women different lengths hair . this device provides 6 petite , 6 small , 6 medium , 6 large , 6 jumbo . might fine women shoulder length hair , but not everyone . there not enough one size get job . there not enough two sizes get job . if your hair just cut , it short use larger sizes , unless you long hair start . my wife hair not quite shoulder length , she got problem . so , i figured , no big deal , just order dozen right size . one dozen additional rollers cost $35 . i only paid $29 unit 30 rollers . that not what i call customer friendly .	1

dentist over 20+ years experience , i seen over over again results not flossing one teeth . unfortunate result such neglect cavities ( especially kids ) , inevitable gum disease adults , which both cass over time leads tooth loss . gum disease almost always starts in-between teeth only way clean germs cause gum disease cavities teeth floss . mechanical scrubbing floss key , all daily brushings rinsings not remove in-between stubborn plaque below gumline . bottom line we need floss our teeth if we want keep them lifetime . i heard all excuses not flossing : floss too hard handle , my fingers turn blue , my fingers too fat , i'm too clumsy , floss hurts my gums , etc , etc . this disposable flosser great kids , who may not dexterity load non-disposable flosser , such " flossaide dental floss holder " , which i recommend adults ( see my review ) . i recommended this floss aid my young patients over years i strongly recommend it you well . one still develop habit flossing daily , this device aides mechanics flossing , making it breeze . get it save your teeth ! jim " konedog " koeni	1

i few minor quibbles this razor , but it gives you nice close , comfortable shave . isn't what we want end ? i don't know anyone who buys one these things its " ergonomic design features . " it holds charge good long time , shaves your face nice . rinse it clean running water you're . that what i'm looking . only things keeping me 5 star review i'm not yet comfortable how razor sounds when running . it seems like it always needing charge ... but that how it sounds full charge . it take some getting used i guess .. others might find quiet running mode plus . also , monthly cleaning cutters/combs bit complicated .	1
upgraded this razor after my old remington died , i've very happy it . it cut bit close , which irritated my skin first , but i think just me getting used " lift cut . " this would excellent razor if it wasn't two features ( or lack thereof ) make it pain use . 1 . internal battery nicd . this type battery " memory " it , which means optimal performance , battery should fully drained before you recharge it . otherwise , life battery slowly shorten until battery useless . 2 . there isn't low battery indicator . itself , either these features wouldn't pose problem . combined , you're left wondering when you'll charge shaver , or when you're off business trip , if you'll need bring charger . long run , this razor cheap enough i expect battery last years . still , it would better if battery made nimh or some technology that not 15 years old .	1

replacement blades must . razor remind you once year which fine most cases . but , if you heavy beard or shave more than once day , i , then you should replace blades every 8 months or so . reminder razor only suggestion , not command . after all , it not know when blades get dull . so , i simply ignore reminder replace blades when i feel it necessary . one thing you must use new blades several days until they settle adjust your skin . until then you may little irritation . problem i solved hair my neck . i use think harder i press razor , better it would get those stray hairs . but , all i got rash . i discovered if i simply use very light touch not press hard then it got those hairs much better no redness . replace your blades least once year your face thank you	1

i very satisfied monitor . it easy use seems quite accurate . i disappointed find when i opened box there no instructions included . quick phone call them way . i able use it without instructions but could not set time , etc . all-in-all it quite satisfactory device	1
i like portability adjustability this mirror . it takes up little space stowed away very compactly . it serves my needs very well . i disappointed only magnifying mirror lit . i tend use normal mirror more often . other clock loses it setting when i stow it away . it reset left out if you really wanting use clock feature . far i am concerned ... i looking mirror really could care less clock	1
i using this razor 6 years now , probably long they out . they may pricey but well worth it . i used use disposables nicked/cut my legs almost every time . i switched these maybe nicked my legs very little . it so quick easy use , my legs much smoother than they ever disposables shaving creams . they only last 3-5 shaves , but if you figure price disposables shaving cream , it probably not much more expensive	1
i not overweight many years , but i still last 5-10 pounds just not stay off . i several issues eating - i tend eat very large portions when i am really enjoying meal , i snack lot , i major sweet tooth . this product taken care all 3 problems . i am currently taking 1000 mg 3 times day . i plan cut back little once i'm my target weight . i find this dosage generally suppress my appetite and/or urge eat 3-6 hours . it odd me experience hunger without cravings frantic urge eat ... but that what pills me . most time i tell i'm hungry only because my stomach growling it several hours since my last meal ... but i don't feel like i eat anything right away . i go grocery shopping when i'm hungry not make poor choices , even when i finish up gym after work i don't feel ravenous anymore . i definitely get full faster . it doesn't feel like it used when i overate , i just tell i've eaten enough i stop . what concept ! often i just bite or two good 30-60 min if i'm too busy sit down eat . my urge snack really curbed . i still one or two snacks most days , but they much smaller often more healthy . now i actually stay up several hours past dinner without making mini-meal , which i used almost every night . hoodia not completely kill my appetite , it suppresses it quite bit but more than anything it takes away all my cravings . definitely my favorite part - i used crave sugar morning until night practically every day . since my first day these pills , only time i've sweets when someone offered me something . i'm able eat just little not wish ten times more . it not occur me go vending machine work anymore , or buy candy when i'm shopping . maybe even more than weight loss , emotional benefits these pills incredible me . i'm no longer berating myself constantly overeating or too much candy or dessert . i'm not depressed all day anymore because my favorite pants gotten snug , all i think why i don't willpower prevent it . i would definitely recommend this product , especially anyone who issues food like i	1
tape measure , it what it says it . you press button tape tightens around your body part . you won't worry , " i hold tape tigher last time ? " tension always same consistent measurements every time . tape starts measurement 2 " since tape casing holds tape part measures around 2 inches . i think this tape accurate plus-or-minus half-an-inch but it sure beats regular tape measure since least button ensures each time tape wraps around you same tension level	1
first all , let me say this product great almost every way . so if you need feel better your nose and/or throat , go it . my main complain grossan hydro pulse it noticeably expensive . some time ago , grossan making just his own irrigator tip matching it waterpik machine cost half price hydro pulse . but then , grossan decided produce his own machine , if i'm right , viajet making it him . viajet sells same machine , except grossan tip , -again- half price hydro pulse . breathe-ease solution you might use irrigator also expensive ( i check this comparing it simillar product purchased my country ) . so what makes hydro pulse so expensive ? maybe health business , after all . other than , like i said , this product great almost any respiratory problem . i used irrigate my nose similar solution comes 135 ml bottle , intended use it over 50 times . hydro pulse lets you 500 ml clean everytime , so you get idea . also , if you suffering respiratory problems want chek interesting drug-free treatment , look buteyko method	1

i purchased this dryer replace older one far too loud . while this new one much quieter than old one , it really isn't super-quiet . still , i no complaints noise , but flimsy wall mounting hardware story . threaded holes mounting plate extremely fragile , so much so they both wrung out during initial mounting dryer . it didn't help any mounting holes extremely hard locate once plate mounted - it hard see thru white plastic shell . i ended up discard original threaded screws use two slightly larger metal tapping screws mount dryer bracket . this worked fine , but original mounting hardware isn't very well designed my opinion . other than dryer seems work very well , although i haven't it long enough know how well it last . all all , i'd give dryer 4 stars out 5	1

i found this product after reading review it hairboutique.com . length my hair seemed reached plateau just below my shoulders after year seemed grown no longer . i decided try this product see if it worked . hair growth normally clocked 1/8 inch per month , i decided monitor results my own little " clinical test . " this actually pretty easy because i colour my hair so i'd easily able see how much growth there each month . i ordered box viviscal which i paid $49 ( average price web ) set take first pill following morning ( box recommends 2 per day ) . i coloured my hair night before so one month i'd able accurately measure how much growth there looking growth since colouring . results : i didn't really notice anything until around 2 week time frame . i noticed my nails growing very fast/very long . i weak nails split easily they barely seem grow all . it very noticeable because i use computer all day nail growth causing my fingers constantly slip keyboard . never great nails , i pretty happy see this . my curiosity also getting better me i could see roots my hair pretty clearly which unusual 2 weeks after coloring . i took tape measure measured almost 1/4 inch hair growth . this would mean 1/2 inch per month 6 inches per year . i pretty excited because although numbers seemed small , it twice rate my hair normally grows . but i also noticed something else . my hair becoming unusually greasy . because i very dry hair , i normally only wash it 2-3 times week . but every other day it seemed much more greasy than normal . hmmm . well , 1 month time frame i measured my hair growth it exactly 3/4 inch . not only but i constantly trimming my nails this point . i totally ecstatic . but also this point , i washing my hair every day - it no longer dry brittle , it much softer , but there no way i could miss day washing it or it would greasy . so - conclusions i reached my test this : 1 . yes , viviscal works . it caused my hair growth stimulated over twice speed . 2 . viviscal also makes your nails much stronger grow much faster . 3 . viviscal makes your hair greasy , causing you wash it every day - then it fine . it not cause any extra hair growth anywhere else , which i thought bit strange ( though good !!! ) . i recommend this product	1

i am biochemist education teaching physiology university . such , i am very knowledgeable chemistry human body general . i really like neutragena products this product certainly very high quality . most people , i think it offers great protection , but not best protection people who need very conscious sun exposure possibility skin cancer . according my dermatologist , recent studies shown spf 15-30 wipes off after few hours doesn't offer adequate protection after time . this partly due most people not using enough . other words , they underestimate how much they need apply get level protection . this reason , neutrogena spf 45 or 55 better . also , neutrogena ultra sheer products updated include technology called helioplex . most dermatologists i know feel this makes difference effectiveness some people this going very important . i used both this product higher spf helioplex formulations . practice , i found both adequate my needs . what i particularly like you don't even know you product . it virtually no scent it really so sheer you can't even notice it . both these products stay long time good all day use , but my understanding helioplex formulation even better . further , it feels exactly same skin . only drawback it bit more expensive . this also good product because it protects against both uva uvb rays . both implicated skin cancer it important protect yourself against both . if you looking everyday sunscreen this might one . however , if you want very best protection try neutrogena helioplex spf 55 . this give you most peace mind	1

now i'm writing this review , it seems silly i'm so happy over such small thing toothbrush . but i am . i bought this item not long after i my first ( hopefully only ) root canal crown four years ago , something which i never again want experience my life ( someone else described , it painful expensive ) . growing up , i didn't take care my teeth like i should've , so i'm accustomed always told there either cavity , or start one , more work . after root canal , my mom recommended brush least certain number pulsations/oscillations , because that what she'd recommended her dentist combat her receding gums . this specific item met those requirements , it affordable . when i first started using it , my gums very sensitive it , but quickly wore off , so it seems me it strengthens gums . it also much easier get behind front teeth . subsequent dentist vists my mom shown her gums improved dramatically after using high-quality electric toothbrush such this one ( i honestly don't remember if she this exact model , but ours similar ) , i've not needed any work dentist beyond regular cleanings since i purchased it . far cleaning unit keep it " gunking " up , i'm only person who uses this item , so any extra toothbrush heads still package they came , not dripping into storage container ; so i don't know how combat . but i just take toothbrush head off thing rinse it , then rinse hand-held part , set them back unplugged charger/base ( i only plug it when battery runs low ) things stay clean no problem	1

this variation classic pre-shave lotion , but solid form . main ingredient parafin , petroleum destilate grounded very fine powder molded thru extrusion into solid bar . once it touches your face skin it pulverizes again remains skin fine lawyer talc-like powder . contrary apparences it lubricates skin almost flawlessly . course if you press electric shaver much it burn your skin ! nonetheless this high quality product ( made switzerland ) why rather expensive side , but it certanly delivers 100% its intended use purpose . i always keep 5 o 6 bars one time stock , because i know it too good product before it substituted chinese cheaper import	1

i actually bought this book based all negative reviews it not enough " fill blanks . " i wanted baby book would give me topic let me journal it without too much prompting . there few fill-in pages ( see below ) , but most part i write my feelings thoughts my baby my own words . this seems like much more personal approach , one i think my son appreciate more when he old enough read it , than fill blank pages . previous reviewer complained pages thin newspaper-like . true , they simple white pages black titles , but pages themselves not all flimsy -- thicker than average novel page more like lightweight cardstock . illustrations small , simple , non-intrusive . black white line drawings more iconic than cutesy . my only complaint this baby book i would like more topics ( birth story , tooth chart , food , favorite expressions , favorite toys/games . . . ) however , pages look like they 11 " 8.5 " it bound ribbon , so i think little creativity , cardstock hole punch i may able add my own pages . topics covered ( one full page allowed per topic ): baby name ( fill blanks)family tree ( line illustration fill blanks)all momall dadexpectationsparties showers ( 2 pages)first impressionsbirth certificatehandprintsfootprintslock hairvisitors giftsfirst family photofirsts ( fill blanks)baby favorite thingsdoctor visitsgrowth chart ( fill blanks)medical records ( fill blanks)first birthdaysecond birthdaythird birthdayfirst vacationholidays celebrationsletter momletter dadkeepsakesreflections there also small pouch baby first haircut , pockets back store cards , documents other loose memorabilia	1

i loved idea clapper . i live alone so clapping sound wouldn't bother me i looked forward convenience factor . my first clapper lasted 4 months then mysteriously stopped working , but dead unit smell suspiciously funny - like electrical short . i learn my lesson ? oh , no ! i went ahead purchased clapper some months later . night before last , lamp i connected this one started blinking . i checked lightbulb it ok . it only went i got down close clapper plugged into outlet i heard dreaded sizzling sound saw flash electricity . once again clapper crapped out , this time different lamp , different outlet . i never learn ? thank goodness nothing happened due highjinks this faulty device . you say " housefire " ? again , how dumb am i ? unit ul-approved , if so , any other complaints lodged it ? how one find this out ? i like my gadgets , but " buyer beware " this one	-1

this great scale very accurate . i no problem this . i also difficulty turn it first , but after i read manual , it easy . it very accurate 9/10 gave same weight . 1 pound ( one off . 2 pound ) you need tap it making it vibrating . don't just tap since it won't turn , but if you tap it just like you softly hit it so top glass vibrate , then it .	1
i love these because they're delicious just thing getting me through long workout . they're also perfect traveling , easy pack , sustain you during all day hike or touristy walkabout . friend mine iraq says he eats them twice day , taste , also because -- i agree -- he trusts energy product designed military soldiers much more than energy product designed private company profit	1
reading some these comments , after sampling hooah bar , i understand why these bars give you long lasting energy . they're oily sugary . lots sugar quick energy oil stays stomach longer so you don't feel hungry quickly- that why much fast food so popular , it tastes good its satisfying , but it ain't necessarily good you ! recipe makes it sweeter , certainly oilier , than eating ordinary candy bar . i think snickers tastes better . those who using these meal replacement bars , i'd real careful . bar might ' balanced ' but it isn't meal . whatever energy bar you consume , they're good before workout or post-workout recovery but don't confuse them proper meal all components found there . me , i prefer odwalla bar or cliff bar . less grease , true natural ingredients , less hype	-1
out 3 flavors available , this one favorite both my boys ( 4yrs 7yrs ) . but no matter what flavor its snack they both eat enjoy !	1

this energy drink perfect those late nights when you need mental boost get you through few more hours work . writer often under deadline pressure , i've relied caffeinated products like coke red bull years , but invariably they make me jittery i hard time focusing . not so hooah drink ... like friend giving you leg up onto something , it helps me make it through more work than i could my own , my brain doesn't feel all frazzled like neurons midst aimless firing frenzy when i drink it . my focus actually improves , which makes sense given it designed keep soldiers alert through life or death situations	1

these bars supposed women because they lower cal more calcium . i think there other factors well . men usually affraid products like vitamins women stangely enough , but they say they need calcium protein too . i really like key lime flavor it great . i like lemon also chi tea . i like those flavors because they light tasting i not always chocolate way some people . lime reminds me florida keys . these really better than original cliff bars when they came out i not eat man ciff bar . i used eat one these breakfast everyday soy milk when i busy life . thankfully my life slowed down now . it good grab go food	1

while i love scott brand products ... i don't think this package such great deal .... this price works out $1.60 per roll !! i thought buying bulk supposed cheaper ?? you buy 4-pack around $3.00 , well , least you here florida ! total waste money .. unless it necessary you buy bulk . maybe $20 off special it may worth it ? i'm agreement fellow reviewers ! scott changed ( don't you just hate when companies fix what isn't broke ?? ) their toilet paper now stiff , scratchy feel .. guess that why they came up extra soft version . yes , it seems they weld start sheet roll now .. i think they want you use up half roll just getting it started .. make you buy more more frequently !! i think i'll pass this " package deal " .. i don't money flush	1
i using this product regularly couple years am very pleased it . i notice difference when i begin my healthy day source life shake fruit . due my job , i rarely get lunch break time ( usually late ) morning shake stabilizes my blood sugar carries my through lunch . now several my co-workers using it well . they pleasantly surprised flavor compared other health drinks . i mix it blender bananas , sometimes mixed fruit , lots ice . i also add good squirt flaxseed oil . one co-worker likes it banana , coconut milk , apricot nector pineapple . i highly recommend it very broad spectrum healthy nutrients one good tasting drink	1

i purchased this panasonic oral irrigator take when traveling . since i prosthetic device my lower jaw , i need way keeping area clean . it kind hard lugging regular sized water pik when traveling . this portable unit worked great me . it easy fill handle , water pressure sufficient job . i would even consider using it home daily . very satisfied this product .	1
panasonic ew1270ac portable oral irrigator works well removing anything left behind after flossing , seems it clean any pockets gums flossing cannot reach . only downside two aa batteries not seem last long . would recommend rechargables	1
i am very happy way these wipes perform . they seem gentle they very soft - almost like felt . price great when you babies tow when shopping physical stores you really appreciate large/heavy things like this just appear your door ! wipes container comes extra covering after you raise hinged lid ( presumably help keep them drying out ) my only complaint would when you pull wipe through little opening sometimes " chain " wipes fall back you take whole top off thread them back through opening .	1
i only used this couple times but works great . no problems . it maybe little heavy some numbers attatchments little hard read but aside it cuts great . it runs quiet i found it easy use never this myself before . well worth money .	1
i like green tea diet pill many reasons . first , it causes bored eater ( that'd me ) eating aimlessly throughout day . secondly , since i've taken it 2 half months i ( actually this started happening within few weeks continued ) , capsules helped shrink my stomach probably half what it used , so when i eat , i don't overdo it . keep mind when i say stomach , i mean one your food drops into , not your waistline . however , no means am i saying there no weightless physically . there ! so far i've lost 15 pounds . some you might thinking , " well that surely exercise , i'm not one time , or i hate exercising . " you know what ? those you exercise you'll lose even more weight than me 2.5 month mark , because i go day day doing general stuff , nothing like walking or jogging miles or riding bike . however , i've figured few things key those aren't too keen exercise ( word alone makes me shudder ) . if you don't time exercise routinely or very long , or you just hate word " exercise " ( i know it cause terror within few us , don't lie ) then keep these things mind when you take this amazing pill : -going grocery store ? don't go when you're hungry don't park closest building spot ( unless it dark then it scary ) . obvious reasons , don't go when you're hungry , you'll just end up popping everything into your cart ( some stuff you don't even know what heck it when you get home unpack ) . instead , i'm sure you know this , maybe go after dinner or after lunch . what get ? that few paragraphs down . -going shopping ? word make you giddy delight ?... only until you realize you really don't money doing it ? alright , here solution . go mall or outlet stores or wherever else it you could spend hours looking around stuff . park furthest building spot , leave tempting ways payment either home or your car ( hidden stealth ! ) , go building window shop ! spend least half hour doing this however long ( though you'll get kicked out if you try stay past closing time ) . if you think it weird exercise mall/store , it really not . i know i've seen few power walkers my mall it totally obvious what they're doing , but thing you don't . exercising this way easy just browsing stores , circulating mall , bypassing food court ( unless you need water ) checking out potential christmas gifts while getting regular workout ! -play your kids least half hour day ( outside) ! play hide seek ! run after them ! shoot hoops ( not only it exercise , it helping hand-eye coordination ! ) , throw few balls , kick soccer ball , play swing set , walk around park while your kids play ! there so many great activities family bonding time you get easy workout , too ! it win-win both you your kids . -no kids ? pets next best thing . i three dogs one cat . they're sweetest , most evil things entire world ! not only they make me take run my money ( literally , cause they steal my shoes anything else they get take outside ) they also warm my heart make me laugh smile . 30 minutes playing your pets great way help amplify effects this diet pill ! -have good laugh . find your funny friends , people , laugh much you ! you lose loads calories way!there definitely more small things help you lose weight , especially when taking this pill , but what what food right ? stay away carbs . period . they not your friend all time . especially since they let lose all things your fatty cells need keep their greedy little lives prosperous your thighs/stomach etc . must them ? i know your pain . instead start getting used whole grain wheat . don't shrink terror , it not bad ! eating habits , especially bad ones need rethought when taking this pill best results ! well , that my review , little what i've help you get your way better , happier , healthier you ! i hope this helped least some people ! this how it worked me , but keep mind , every one body unique special it own way it likes losing weight , so just find niche you're good go ! good luck !!	1

there so many varied reviews this product depending which version you clicked ! here what i've found mine : first , this intended work adult acne , occasional blemish . sorry teens , this probably isn't best choice you unless you only occasional break-out . second , this only works new pimples so when you get it , don't expect ones you currently suddenly disappear . it works best when you first notice pimple appearing , especially just starting get sore , slight red spot stage . sad , it actually work , provided you keep first two rules mind ! two days after i received mine , i noticed tell tale red spot beginning form , i zapped it not only it not get worse , next morning , it completely gone ! plus , portion pink version goes breast cancer research if you buy it company ( not sure amazon ) there 30-day money back guarantee . all all , great product	1
food mill very handy . i didn't bother using it my first two kids ( i'd received one hand-me-down friend ) . it seemed too much hassle . fact , it really simple . i use it daily my third child wish i'd experimented it few years ago . our pediatrician encourages us give our child what we eat , not depend gerber or beech nut too much . problem it difficult mash ( spoon or fork ) foods like banana , avocado , potato , small curd cottage cheese other soft foods consistency my child eat ( super smooth ) . this food grinder you . it really easy clean simple tote around . i'll even mill several foods during one sitting , cleaning it food types - it easy take apart , clean reassemble . response other reviews this site , you put cooked chicken into it , or crisp apple , but these won't become smooth yogurt . , you'd add water chicken , possibly add some other blending agent like potato , use electric blender . apple or carrots , you'd need cook it before you could put it into mill it would become smooth ( like applesauce ) . milling foods like corn peas probably result some residual solid bits ( skin pea or kernel ) . completely rid food , you'd use seive ; even electric blender would yield some solid bits . this product probably most useful children ages 6 months 1 year	1

before i bought this product i given sample pack featuring art shaving pre-shave oil , shaving cream , after-shave balm . they called it " one perfect shave " they weren't kidding , really . this far best shaving cream i ever used . though i highly suggest using brush , cream still lathers beautifully or without one . it bonds each hair like rubber glove protects my skin like no other . i never any irritation , none . scent , my girlfriend wouldn't want me use any other kind . sandalwood screams " male " lasts long time . i never buy any other shaving cream	1
first what i like it : it helps suppress my appetite , when i eat i feel full faster . i take 3 day , not proposed 5 day . i taking it month half now , legitimatly lost 5 pounds ( this isn't just fluctuation , i accounted ) . i didn't increase or decrease my work out activities . i swim 3 nights week half hour . i before taking pills , didn't swim any extra days after taking pills . what i don't like so much : bottle says take 2 morning , 1 lunch , 2 dinner . seems so excsessive , pills huge kind hard swallow . this rate bottle only lasts 18 days ( 90-count bottle ) . also after taking it month half straight , 3 day , no skipping ... i went out town weekend forgot pills . well let me tell you , when i got hungry i felt like i hadn't eaten days , i starving . hunger came back like times 10 . so beware ! all around i would , buy it again . maybe month half too soon judge , we'll see	1
this little guy his job pretty well , but pain refill . it pretty much every day or two , it drips quite bit when you lift it out take sink . i would probably buy it again , but bit drag .	1
not much say other than this great product . it similar myoplex lite ( peanut butter crisp too ) bars , but much lower sugar content	1
my initial impression after using it two days now favorable . my gums bled lot , but might because i've never brushed my teeth this insanely till now . i believe manufacturer claim you ' brush 40 seconds ' fairly accurate , here why : because it uses 6 brush surfaces time ( instead 1 regular toothbrush ) , it truly time saver respect . you certainly feel like you geting more out your typical 1 minute brushing you ever before . someone really thinking outside box when they designed this thing . big advantage this product ( me ) , you still only spend 40 second 1 minute per brushing ... vs . 3 minutes+ product like sonicare . i just didn't see myself making commitment keeping it over long haul ( just realistic ) . also , this product requires very little skill properly position ( just bit down , hold hydrabrush two fingers , so it self-pivot ... whereas sonicare other electric brushes require 30 seconds per quadrant you must skilled enough aim it angle it ... sure , not hard , but if your using bad technique , then yours also not doing good job . i accidently run it high first time , before i realized low second click over , not first click over , which seems kind counter-intuitive me . i should looked unit closer , it shows " 2 dots " ( fast ) shows " 1 dot " ( slow ) ... they tried , but i still got it wrong somehow . result my first use high setting , my rear gums bled lot . this documented instruction seem normal ( bleed first few days ) . i think fast speed ultimately what i want use , but slow nearly effective still quite workout teeth gums . clearly , slow best newbies like myself . i write this , i still feel my gums they feel like they got quite workou t.t he brush unit itself quite big , but brushes smaller than expected , which good thing . pictures online made these brushes appear quite huge i wondered how i'd room it all my mouth . some people small mouths might potentially issue using hydrabrush . some people small hands might potentially find holding it bit cumbersome . it works fine me , despite large size . my kids saw me using it today after work they like " wow dad , thats cool " ... " it looks like it really good job ! " . i read brushes not easy put take off -- but it seems fairly easy , not really hard . i wouldn't want share electric toothbrush anyone first place ! i took them off clean off brushes little better , so i removed brushes pressing small metal pin each brush head ( there two brush heads totaland pull ) pulling each one out -- not hard if you ask me . putting them back simply : push , click ... its , then repeat second head . i worry litle dual motors holding up over time . it seems like motors almost bog down times my rear molars , esp . low speed ... but it keep going . you bite down little less it seems relieve motor strain somewhat . i've noticed this mainly only observed after week use . fully charged , it powerhouse . i'm trying see how many days it'll last single charge . so far , two days still going strong . its doing lot work , so i perhaps worry batteries won't last long . i say it " feels " like i just got out dental cleaning , most part . you know , its good , clean feeling -- but also one where you feel bit abused . my teeth gums feels pretty beaten up just 1 minute . i say i perceive 1 minute brush time very effective , based how clean it feels after such short period brushing . it feels like brushed lot longer than i . i hope my gums get used this stop bleeding few more days . bleeding never lasts long , which i think good sign . i read somewhere this toothbrush not waterproof , appears true , it came ' water shield ' go around brush unit , just below where brushes attach . this seems work pretty well it doesn't seem come loose . so far , unit staying dry little no extra effort my part . i don't really use included holder or case , i just set unit side sink ( small washcloth ) so it drip dry into sink . thats just me . unit charges overnight they tell you not overcharge it beyond . it blinks while charging then stops after its charged . they says its good something like 40 uses , which i'll surprised if thats true . i'd happy if it lasted 20 1 minutes sessions . i've used it 5 times thus far . using hydrabrush consists holding unit two fingers ( loosely ) then biting down somewhat brushes letting it glide down your teeth somewhat its own . you push pull it somewhat , but you don't angle or work brushing technique all . this truly gadget which could turn us all into brushing idiots . this quite strange , but seems pretty easy it hard imagine people hard time using it , after adjusting its strangeness . small amount toothpaste i put into each brush seems get stuck take little extra cleaning remove after brushing . maybe i'm not putting right . owners manual makes it sound like toothpaste ' optional ' -- strange . feeling i get after using hydrabrush -- " wow , my teeth feel really clean " . i don't think my back molars ever brushed this much vigor before . i guess real test ( comments i get ) my next dentist appointment . update : bleeding gums long since stopped hydrabrush still going strong original ( first ) charge . i'm very impressed brush , it appears doing good job my teeth . i'm hoping good comment my dental hygienist my next visit . i've also using waterpik ... its also very good product . no , i haven't tried extra reach brushes . since my teeth badly worn down childhood grinding , i fugured my teeth too short require those brush heads . i think i'm getting plenty coverage basic heads , but i could see how people better teeth ( taller teeth ) could require extra reach heads . hydrabrush finally run out power initial charge -- i would say i got good 2 weeks charge , if not more . one minor concern come up after using hydrabrush , amount noise it makes , esp . when using bedtime , when others might already asleep . it gets louder more drained batteries get , so it might more motor strain noise than anything . i've noticed fully charged batteries more quiet . i'm still impressed how good this makes my teeth feel after only 1 minute brushing . i believe its time i write review amazon , not i've some time use this product . i would add hydrabrush would probably not so great little kids , since brush itself quite big might too much little pallete , little teeth . probably ages 10+ would appropriate . update : i since switched high speed setting . i would also say ( me ) this product , like water pik , tad messy requires you brush over sink , so water toothpaste drop into it while brushing . it not major amount , but i find controlled ' drool ' while brushing almost necessary , unless you stop middle . i just drool complete it 1 minutes or less . i advise using included rubber ( waterproof sheath ) included , it keeps water running down onto handle while use . since unit not fully waterproof , using this mandatory my mind . i buy this see if this device " real " , or just infomercial gimmick ... but i'll say , it real ... if you go into it open mind some flexibility little noise mess ... this really nice job your teeth . replacement heads cheaper than sonicare well . four pack really two complete replacement sets . two pack single replacement set	1
this radically different toothbrush , but it didn't take me long get hang using it properly , my teeth feel cleaner then they ever before . i really am glad i bought it	1
these things work . once you figure out how use them . all you carefully hold each end finger tips , using nuckle each finger raise or lower lip , center lay strip across teeth . use your finger nail tuck into spaces each tooth , making sure keep fingernail space tooth you just tucked before you move onto next space or tucking it into one pull last one out . once you it couple times , it smooth sailing then . i not think you find whitener this easy use this reasonably priced , actually works very , very well . i'm smiling you right now so you see what i mean . ;] , impressed aren't you ? i know i i definetely buy this product again . i also recommend it all my friends who not bright smiled i now am . your self favor -- get this ! kim schil	1
decent nail brush . i purchased it clean out assorted grime accumulates after day construction , it fairly well . i wish it stiffer bristles , also some problems grimy water getting inside body brush , it constructed two pieces popped together . this not issue anything but aesthetics , however , it not effect function brush .	1
we bought rechargeable batteries all sizes use wide array baby gear our son . we these particular batteries his swing crib light music toy , they last weeks charge . these definitely save us money long run less wasteful than single-use batteries	1
this wooden foot roller massageris excellent product . it lightweight , inexpensive , provides easy way simultaneosuly relax rejunvenate tired , achy feet . it wide enough roll both feet it , let acupressure balls work their magic .	1
bought this razor my husband christmas . i looking something replace battery-operated aramis he used years very disappointed when it finally stopped working . he loves this new braun pocket go ; used it almost exclusively since he got it . it not only excellent job - which you might not normally expect battery-operated razor - but it perfect size . thanks , braun	1
so far , these fit bill . just used them first time -- find they easy put , comfortable -- better yet , don't interfere jewelry they would if they hung off chain/rope/string	1
i've used it past 7 years i still get compliments way i smell ... so , i keep buying it ..	1
i waited couple weeks write this review so i could let my face get used new razor . background : i used norelco rotary shavers since i began shave teen . my skin always sensitive any time i tried non-rotary shaver my face would become red irritated . i also felt i getting closest electric shave possible rotary shaver . sometimes i go several days without shaving much i liked rotaries , they not well heavy beard growth . switch : whenever blades needed replacing my rotary shavers i would buy whole new razor . price replacement blades almost much shaver itself . my most recent norelco served me well but recent months shaving became dreaded experience . norelco uses motor rather than vibrator like most other shavers it tend slow down when blades dull beard thick . decision : although i never luck non-rotary shavers i tried friend braun once surprised how much closer it shaved how my face felt good afterward . his cheap $29 model i would happy it , but i liked style model 5775 . anything more expensive seemed just more gimmicks . i simply cannot see what would justify over $100 electric razor . review : this closest shaving razor i ever owned it actually makes shaving pleasure . wider head way various slots arranged lets me shave gliding razor over my face . no pressure needed . bad : it feels big heavy ( which taken positive ... feels remarkably well built ) . swivel head pure gimmick . it doesn't swivel during normal shaving seems useless . braun could made shaver smaller , lighter fewer parts prone break if they left " feature " off . highly recommended - excellent value .	1
one best shavers braun made long time many options use . you use it just like it , brush it out then rinse hot water . option you purchase clean charge stand . also you purchase 12 renewal pack which comes cutter block foil , 12 cartridges your clean charge stand . also they make two cases 5775 , one square soft case they also make hard case . you buy protective cap foil , clean out brushes . i using braun shavers over 50 years . i presently own 5775 model braun i highly recommend it anyone .	1
i purchased this use desk chair my office work . i basically interested heat feature . heat massage turn off after 15 minutes . this described safety precaution but it highly annoying re-set everything every 15 minutes .	-1
shaver great price . it provides very close comfortable shave . no problems . i not checked battery life yet , but soon	1
used variety shavers remmington , norelco braun , panasonic es4025sc far best yet . most obvious improvement how quiet unit operates . others sound like buzz-saw , but you barely hear this one . it especially effective body hair , but also works well facial head hair thicknesses . panasonic also never bites , often occurs other shavers . unless they discontinue this model , i never buy different shaver again	1
shaver fantastic , most reviewers agree . however , after two months gentle use , cleaning stand stopped working . braun telling me send it repair shop but , luck would it , i can't find my receipt so i can't get it repaired under warrantee . even if i could find receipt , i would send stand my expense . i bought this shaver because i felt i would buying quality . i am product designer profession i feel this product not worth money , especially light their repair policy . if they stand behind their products , i would fine this failure , but , it stands , i regret buying this shaver i doubt i purchase anything else braun	-1
this product works great , i use it while pregnant . it not contain dea which studies showing may cause cancer interfere fetal brain development . i love smell too !!	1
fountain pen well balanced elegant look it both modern yet timeless . only drawback i would preferred finer nib - med nib flows nicely very even never skips but would liked finer line . too bad it not offered option	1
reviewed using cross converter waterman florida blue ink : inexpensive copier paper , this pen medium point writes smoothly wet , never skipped . it starts instantly after days capped , weighted sized perfectly adult man , excellent grip . converter screw-in , safety deal all converters should use . section barrel threads metallic finished - if not all metal - threads not too loose or fine . very slight closed-cap looseness doesn't effect performance . posted , it looks much more expensive than it , current amazon prices ! lifetime warrantee .	1
i really like this dryer . it dries faster than most leave my hair softer than my previous blowdryer . it takes moment or two it heat up , but never gets so hot it would burn me . i love two attachments able complete 3 types styles without problem . only negative ( others mentioned ) " cool " button . it not uncommon fingers rest it while styling then all my heat gone . it need better usability testing	1
wow i no idea id saying this but after reading reviews when i purchased this item , after i received used it more than 2 weeks now ... they werent kidding ! this thing dries ur hair really well fast without leaving it dry !!! my hair looks healthy soft throughout whole day . must-buy if ur looking hair-dryer	1
amazon asked me review it because i ordered it . however , i never received it since it seems permanently out stock . so i ended up canceling my order . note . i 5 year old almost identical oxyjet irrigator which excellent although i repair its leaking plastic tube . i also same toothbrush which excellent too . note . i also half dozen other oral irrigators . oxyjet far best . note . ultrasonex better toothbrush . it hard find these days	1
i used various oral irrigation products over twenty years oral oxyjet dlx 8900 far best	1

i really like this scent . it light feminine . also , i like price . you get pretty big bottle price .	1
aside lightening fast shipping , i must rave over this scent ! initially , i knew i loved this perfume ( before my amazon purchase ) sample ad magazine . december , while walking through department store my boyfriend , i decided test fragrance gather his opinion . he didn't seem interested time , so i delayed making purchase . few weeks ago i finally broke down ordered it through amazon . i already run through 1/4 bottle , my boyfriend loves it ! yea	1
this classic fragrance , not your overpowering j-lo , b'spears , etc . i wish i could explain scent ... but it tough describe . it isn't fruity or flowery . perhaps bit lavendar though ? basically , you don't overpower room it . it bit " old-world " -ness it ... but far i am concerned , wonderful thing . i am 31 year old professional , i wear it daily out night , i just love it .	1
this item seems work every bit well much more expensive oral power brushes . i see no reason spend $50 -$90 . even more expensive sonic brushes may worth it , but this one great job	1
it great not tired arm after brushing my teeth . less than quarter time it gets off sticky film i when i'm lazy brushing my teeth . it so good i don't feel bad when i don't floss daily . i'm saying way too much my dental habits aren't i ? it also useful feature signals when you brushing ( around 2 minutes it jumps off couple times ) which helps make sure i get my whole two minutes . charge lasts enough not annoying . but every couple days you test it out listen whether it rotating fast day before .	1
ok , i must warn you i may sound like infomercial , but i am hooked this product my acne problems . i tried proactiv , murad , acne kit i can't think name addition separate topicals ( e.g. noxzema , clearasil , etc . ) none given me results this product gives . i even tried milder version acne free system didn't good results i get severe acne free system . i wouldn't recommend this product those dry or sensitive skin acne . this very drying formula works my very oily face . i never thought my acne severe , but i would always big zit one place or my face would leave big scars after zit went away . now , i not breakout since using this product ( 3 months ) . i hope it works you !	1
charge time quick charged batteries sustained their charge well reasonable period time	1
they garbage bags , so how worked up you get	1
i find these trash bags extremely useful . they really " grip " well ; i no longer any trouble bag falling into when i add something heavy . long you use standard tall kitchen trash lip , it should work just fine . only beef i this bag when i tie it cinched-up ties , it doesn't completely seal up . there always small opening center	1
i am new using oils but these very interesting . just couple drops trick . i especially like lavendar . there enough bottles last long time . 6 fragrances there plenty variety . recomend	1
i'm so happy output . my roommate returned his " bigger one " , bouhgt this one after me . he felt same great output . it also quiet . tank small handy but because high output , it not work more than 6 hours one tank water . i just shut off it before sleep	1
i very sensitive skin , so i am always reluctant try new skin care products . i end up returning too many because impact my skin . this product not only not irritate my skin , it also helped minor ingrown hair issues , good moisturizer well . scent product minty manly , my humble opinion . all all , product worked well me , someone very sensitive skin	1
clock this product not work . light not shut itself off . these both things description said it should . only thing it stay semi-fogless . this rip off , not buy	-1

i quite few thermalon heat wraps am very satisfied them -- good moist heat . i use one back one neck several times week . they've improved waist ties back one so they sturdier . i've given back wrap my sister , my father girlfriend they all like it too . p.s. i always wondered if these review real -- this my first	1
times , this product godsend . if your child fussy you don't know why , just try it .	1
i've worn this fragrance 3or 4 years now , but they no longer sell it stores . i extremely excited find it amazon really decent price well . shipping fast , i chose free shipping sometimes take up month but i recieved my package within week . so glad full bottle again . i love this fragrance	1
replacement blades work very nice provide uninterrupted ionic air cleaning . replacement blades actutally shinner then original blades much easier clean . i usually run my ionic pro replacement blades when they dirty i put original blades long enough clean replacement blads properly , then put replacement blades back .	1
i am very happy close shave this shaver , my previous shaver braun this gives me closer shave less time . it also very quiet operation . my only knock owners manual says charger needs unpluged after charging complete . this quite inconvient .	1
i'm almost 50 using electric razor most my shaving life . when my trusty norelco needed replacing , my wife bought me latest self-cleaning braun christmas gift . i liked some aspects it , but it always hard time shaving my neck area without going back over it lot times . replacing cutter screen every 6 months or so helped keep it getting progressively worse , but after couple years , i thought i would try something different . i read many reviews decided try norelco spectra system . i've using it several months now i tell you difference my neck like night day . norelco much faster smoother than braun cuts very close after only couple passes . i amazed how much better it than even my old triple-head norelco . if i any negative , it would charging system . first problem , if you provide recharging " stand " , then logic ( imo ) should stand allowed plugged 24/7 razor it , without any adverse affects . however , many places manual tell you doing this shorten life your battery . because they use nicad battery , they ask you only recharge it when it runs low avoid " memory " effect associated diminished capacity . i understand , but second problem , it gets fully charged only 4 hours ! after , you supposed remove it , or unplug , stand avoid overcharging . unfortunately , most us shave morning before work day , then don't return least 9-10 hours . my case , 12 or even 24 hour charge would far more convenient . what so hot " 4-hour charge " anyway ?? ok , how i push button start charge cycle , it automatically shuts off when fully charged ! how easy ? ( gee , that exactly how my braun worked . ) electrical engineer myself , i'm sometimes overly critical things like this . ok , if it me , ( you listening norelco ??? ) i would used nimh battery didn't " deep cycled " , then use lower current " trickle charge " base could left 24/7 . side benefit when you pack trip grab your razor , you know it always 100% charged probably enough juice last entire trip without dragging charger . ok , maybe charger not bad i make it out . i just think it could better . i give it 3 stars , while razor itself gets full 5 stars	1
far best thermometer i ever used . i wish i this when my boys little . i don't even bother ear or under arm versions my little girl - such waste time you always doubt accuracy . so simple . so fast . there isn't chance this thermometer inserted too far . excellent product . i highly recommend this all my friends	1
this best , fastest rectal thermometer market . it accurate , safe ( you literally can't insert it too far ) , very fast . i've used five other rectal thermometers , some which cost much more than this one , i say this one best . look no further	1
i originally bought this item use tub cushion while i sit tub giving my infant bath , but it wonderful , very comfortable great just relaxing tub yourself , it could also used regular seat cushion if you so choose . i like it very much	1

homedics bpw-200 smart sense automatic wrist blood pressure monitor works every time without giving us any frustrating error messages . it super easy switch one user graphic displays easy read very intuitive user(s ) . nice appearance , well made , seems very reliable accurate blood pressure readings . we extremely well satisfied highly recommend product	1
i honestly say these only tweezers you ever need . i 900 other pairs when i misplace these , my eyes well up tears thought losing them . freelance makeup artist , i lot eyebrow grooming . these tweezers wonderful very precise . i reach microscopic hairs , you only see 10x lighted magnified mirror , these babies . these tweezers also fantastic splinters , ingrowen hairs , tackling zits ( which you shouldn't doing . . . tsk tsk ) . careful ! they're sharp	1
i absolutely love this lounger . it most comfortable one i've ever owned , design allows me lie face down without smashing my nose or twisting my neck . i even read while lying face down . pillows arranged fit my individual needs held place velcrow . i little trouble folding lounger up single-handedly , but that okay . great features outweigh this minor annoyance .	1
i bought this my son college here his comments : " razor works great . it closest shave i able obtain eletric razor . cleaning base great idea , because it all work you , only thing you remember put it base . my only complaint my base male plug broke off . it probably just random chance accident it happened mine . they repairing it now i am supposed new unit soon , so phillips good . all all very great razor , especially sale price $50 ! "	1
i bought this shaver not long ago i really like it . where you find good shaver this amazing price .	1
i found i could not get close shave , if i working i would shave later day get . luckily i am retired so no problem . i also cannot cut some beard lower part my neck use trimmer cut any long hairs . not good my old norelco .	-1
we bought chrome model replacement basic no-frills showerhead . showers feel pretty good regular setting , massage setting decent too . showerhead easy install everything included except teflon pipe tape which we found necessary prevent leaks when we screwed this into main plumbing . when head resting cradle , it arches up few inches , which makes it nice tall people under . hose also plenty long enough reach other end tub . problem we showerhead not fit snugly into cradle , unless we unnaturally force it . just setting showerhead cradle results showerhead moving when water turned , mostly because hose still curl it . he solved this problem 2 hair clips hold hose still . one word caution -- if you unscrew swivel piece , careful not lose rubber ring , because it falls out easily . without it , swivel leaks badly . all things considered , i would buy this product again , would suggest it long it going used solely hand-held showerhead or solely cradled showerhead . switching back forth may cause frustration	1
i using this cream two weeks or longer quite honest , i don't see any change all . i am very disappointed would not buy this product again	-1
i used this product approx . 3 years now i much prefer it lotion . it works better me i heavy beard it greatly reduces irritation . i use this product until i either change razors or they make something better	1
everytime i purchase this product it never fails me when i shave . it great smelling aroma , it smooth face	1
great tasting bar . nice soft make it easy eat	1
its sooo good . yummy , filling , natural . what more could you ask	1
these great baby meal times , especially when road or travelling . no need cart sticky bibs around or worry washing them ; bibsters convenient job well	1
i tried small box these first , i loved them . this box 4-pack it great saves you money . they perfect because : - you don't clean them . just throw them away . - they way more comfortable my baby than vinil or plastic ones . - they velcro closing ( no sticky band catching baby hair ) . - 2 or 3 these take almost no space diaperbag . - they big enough cover her chest tummy . - liquids don't get through , so baby clothes stay dry . - pocket catches all food doesn't make it mouth . this great , specially now she starting eat herself only half spoons make it mouth . rest just falls pocket	1
i gotta admi t--t he concept great . you drive , you sit nicely cushioned seat cover also : 1 . massages your upper back , lower back , or both , 2 . optional heating unit comfort warmth , and3 . plugs into your auto cigarette lighter . massage conducted though 5 vibrating balls located inside cushion , therein , literally , lies problem . ball located center upper part cushion digs -- annoying , uncomfortably , very noticeably -- into your back , rendering whole massage/comfort angle moot point . well rest this works , it ( heat perceptible , other four balls feel fine , cushion fits snugly around your seat velcro-closed belt ) , one protruding ball makes this uncomfortable experience . i'm taking mine back . positive side , company just one " point " away very good product . if you see this ( or something like it ) , try " test drive " it store . maybe this company ( or others ) place balls better position other products . few other notes : you cannot turn heat independent massage ; , if massager not , you cannot turn heater . also , this not shiatsu-like massage , not this price . you're getting electricity-generated vibration here , two speeds , low high . high speed , you feel more stimulated than relaxed , if somehow one those old vibrating foorball game surfaces up against your back . fact , brief manual accompanying bk-2500 cautions people against using this night , it may keep you awake little while . still , if you like back buzz , you find similar cushion without very uncomfortable center ball ( didn't anyone test this thing ? ) , you might enjoy product like this . but ... not this one .	-1
my back itches time time . scratching one place often makes spot next it itch . somewhere during this process , it reaches somewhere hard reach , you end up looking like primate . use tools , feel human . i , however cut wheely things off back end . pointless , make product overly long awkward . i bought two ; one home one work . best $10 ( w/ shipping ) i'd ever spent	1
norelco seems moving lot its production electric razors china . i one made there , also this one which still made holland . truthfully , they both seem work equally well , but there issomething nice norelco land created them . no matter where they're , they pleasure use	1
i am really glad i purchased this item . weight very accurate i love it gives weight tenth pound . body fat similar past measures i've taken professionally . water , i tend get dehydrated , so i wasn't surprised mine low , but can't attest how accurate it . ( not even really sure what you use measure ) . setup fairly easy operation easy all information it gives . i would more user friendly only step scale , but i think it worthwhile it store your information . i would never need track 12 people , but i love it stores people information separately . overall , i think this great buy especially price would recommend it anyone needing scale calculates body fat	1
i like this scale . it light . it looks good my bathroom . it seems accurate . it memorize height weight information multiple users , so you your family members use it get your percent water percent fat , addition weight	1
these items arrived time described . rayovac rechargeabe batteries aa aaa sizes always worked great me . they keep their first charge even longer than regular batteries so they sometimes outlast them before even needing recharge . i wish larger size rayovac rechargeables good performers aa aa	1
hasta ahora las he estado usando en mi creative muvo tx fm me han servido . es una l�stima que no vengan con mayor amperaje . he visto que las energizer son mas potentes que estas . talvez sea porque las ray-o-vac salieron primero al mercado ..	1
unlike first review this product , i found it great take me whenever i go out eat . it folds down easily fits my purse . i read both paperbacks hardbacks using easi-reader few problems it . only times it seems slip when you just starting or ending book most pages one side holder . i always people coming up me my table asking holder i give it glowing recommendation . i tell them how track it down internet no idea how many i sold company . i orderded more than 20 myself given many them christmas stocking stuffers . i also given many people who work restaurants i frequent they asked holder i used them tips sometimes . i'm sorry other reviewer not find it useful but i really like it stated previously find it excellent my purposes	1

this energy drink really good . ignore reviewer gave it 3 stars because his body could not get used guru all natural buzz . if you fill your body unhealthy artificial [ ... ] then try guru , your body might freak out . after training your body guru natural ingredients , you won't worry jump-off-a-cliff effect unnatural energy drinks . guru soft buzz definitely picks you up early morning , no matter how early you get up . i work 7am shift need get up around 6 . somedays , my brain too comatose morning i need guru start day . somedays , one guru not enough i take half second make it through day . 98% time , one enough . very soft buzz end day . don't drink guru after 4pm or it might keep you awake night . drink tastes like soda water , but sweeter makes your tongue tingle . definitely not feel like soda pop . much healthier too . people should start using guru popular bar drinks instead rolling . much safer sanitary . consider your options - natural better you long run ! i'm giving drink 4 stars because i am field testing drink long run . jury still out b/c i've only using guru 3 months now . good luck your field tests	1

i norelco accutrim beard moustache trimmer t765 little over year before i lost charger . after looking one both town ( san diego ) internet , i decided just buy new trimmer all together . this point , i began some research . originally , i looked exclusively norelco trimmers though my rational solely based name recognition . after reading many reviews comparing prices , i decided look other brands well . when i came across panasonic er224s . reviews this product overall excellent , price appealing well : only 5 dollars more than my old norelco when bought best buy . before we proceed , i should let you know i am more beard growing enthusiast than beard growing professional . while i growing beard year now , i don't now , nor i ever aspirations zz top caliber beard . said , my needs , this beard trimmer everything i could hope . this trimmer improves over my old norelco so many ways . adjustment setter 14 settings beard length up 20 mm over 9 setting my old norelco offered , setting becomes locked once you power trimmer . there additional detail trimmer offers flexibility my old norelco could never offer , it hides away when you aren't using it . er224s also allows you operate trimmer while it charging . this something drove me nuts concerning my old norelco . it just quiet any other trimmer out there my opinion , it best looking trimmer you buy . it simply looks classy . it doesn't built-in vacuum , but i really don't see necessary . what i read , they most often break or performance sub-standard . grand scheme things , how difficult it rinse out sink after you ? trimmer also rather easy clean . manual very thorough explaining ins outs trimmer . fact , only con i think this product rather large charger . however , i trim my beard 2-3 times week , charge seems keep quite some time . overall , i am very happy this purchase	1

i written poor review previously , based only fact it seemed take forever heating pad arrive after i ordered it . time i got it , i no use it therefore couldn't rate actual product . well , company saw my review wanted make it right , so they refunded expedited shipping i'd paid , which considerable . i appreciate customer service like , especially when i didn't even " demand " it . luck - or whatever - would it , i need heating pad this week . dr. thinks i pulled ligament my back , i don't know . all i know it killed me , so i pulled out my handy new product gave it test ride . i love size it , it heated up lot more satisfactorily than my tiny drugstore one i'd using , delivered nice consistent heat . i also like weight it - resting my other side laying pad across injured part , it felt secure comfortable . i like it digital read thermometer , well timer automatic shutoff . ( i'd actually burned my arm my tiny drugstore model , whose pad inside flannel covering plastic - fell asleep it me my arm must've rested plastic part accidentally - i think i gave myself 2nd degree burn !... all better now tho . ) so , kudos company product . highly recommend .	1
i bought this heating pad chronic back pain after trying many other cheaper brands . out box heating pad feels good . its heavy appears well built . it digital readout which shows current temperature allows you set desired temperature treatment time . default starting temp . 124 . which short period feels too hot . this maybe because once heating pad reachs 124 it turns off . but temperature readout shows 132-134 . once unit shuts off when it reaches its target temperature , it cools off very quickly far sensation heat your body . but temperature readout stay very high even though pad feels cool . so you continually turning temperature pad up , so feel warmth . 15 20 minutes you reach maximum temperature you set heating pad , then unit stops heating your . i tried laying unit out flat walking away . after 15 minutes temperature still reads 142 . this problem this pad . what ever measures temperture this pad so very very slow react , unit unable deliver steady heat . this regard its " same old " , no better delivering heat than $10 heating pad . also , forget using pad darkened room unless you take flashlight . digital read out no backligh t.t he pad deliver its promise moist heat	-1
some ways , this more comfortable than mouth guard i got my dentist because it doesn't cover all my lower teeth . other ways , it less comfortable because it very flexible move out place . i like adjustable sides , though . overall , i'm happy it because it lot less expensive than custom-fitted dental device . it keep me biting down my teeth night , which means i no longer am waking sore jaw . minty flavor pretty apparent first , but now i hardly know it there . so it really doesn't matter what flavor you buy	1
i started grinding my teeth night while studying bar exam ( yeah , guess you could say i stressed ... ) . i went through 2 different models boiler mouth guards ( you boil mold , bite it , then immerse water set it ) but really didn't like them , they seemed flimsy . ultimately , i found this sleepguard model online tried it out . it soooo much better ! instead fitting over all you teeth , it just creates overall gap keeping your back molars apar t.t his model keeper . i don't use it anymore because i stopped grinding after exam - either because stress gone or because this trained me not ... but whatever case , if i buy one again , it would definitely this model . i very very pleased it .	1
i bought this product myself 6 weeks ago . i waited this long before writing so i could honestly say if it worked or not . i've used other bite guards leary purchasing one said it would " fit right out box " , but i pleasantly surprised . it actually fit , no boiling or adjusting . it flexible yet firm enough so i don't grind . i never buy any other kind after this one . i highly recommend this product	1

once we finally got this table put together , we loved it . not much say other than it pretty sturdy good quality . but ... i think we would much easier time assembling it if we simply thrown instructions away solved it like puzzle . instructions vague , error ridden , omitted important parts steps . this manufacturer really needs thoroughly test , update , edit their assembly instructions . i believe tables made states , so it not translation issue	1

( ever notice how permeable artificial flavors ? let say you're eating popsicle -- excuse me -- frozen fruit treat . you close your eyes , flavor clues all but gone . think purple , its tastes like grape ; think orange , it orange , think light blue it bubble gum -- if you know code , . ) this like giant bit-o-honey candy , it chewy texture over laden honey , some sticky peanut butter chocolate thrown , you've pretty much captured flavor . my surprise , there no honey , taste derives somehow syrups , malt , cane juice , fig paste , other sweet ingredients . it definitely filling , especially if accompanied apple or something , least eight ounces water . it very chewy , yet it doesn't seem dry similar products . could it six grams fa t-t wo which saturated ? yes , two grams saturated fat ! not good . i'll try balance fact it made 70% organic ingredients , whopping 11 grams protein , only 20 grams sugar ( compare other brands flavors ) , includes five grams fiber . clif z-bar excellent clif apple raisin walnut , this one better tasting its kind -- just don't expect brownie	1

amazon notes these bags easy life carry -- they right . black color bags helps make your refuse more private , too . this important this day identity theft . bags drawstrings you should draw tight then tie ; but i recommend you also tie very top part actual black bag itself extra strength so it definitely won't break when you take out garbage . hefty lives up its name extra strong . i tried several store brands but none them thick durable hefty . my opinion hefty brand buy . 33 gallon capacity makes these garbage bags great both families single people . bags economical , too . amazon price they cost roughly 35 cents each that good deal especially because bag usually handle two days ' worth garbage . highly recommended .	1

i first received l'eau d'issey pour homme girlfriend who always immaculate taste , her choices all well received . but l'eau d'issey stands out one gets most comments - all positive - both friends total strangers . it actually become bit laugh my favorite starbuck because frequency women line offer favorable remark ( it happened once or twice others , victoria secret very sexy one i recall , but issey miyake way , way ahead respect ) . like one other reviewers , i men also ask it ( usually some disclaimer start ) . i carry refillable travel spritz when road since i consider this one my basics . it works well but appears leak bit volume - nothing major , it doesn't smell up my toiletry bag or anything else suitcase , but i'll usually run out longer trips .	1
i 12 colognes now this one among aqua di gio , burberry weekend scents - very light aquatic , making it suitable spring summer . issey miayke stands out crowd though , because it works your skin chemistry , until point where you can't smell it but others notice it quick whiff . yes , it last long long time , top , middle , low notes all work together create truly long lasting , quality cologne .	1

i replaced conair beard/mustache trimmer whose battery died , i've very happy it . i like fact it run power supply plugged , not option conair . i'm surprised negative comments other reviews , since i've never adjustable comb ( which controls how long it leaves your hair ) fall off . i agree one combs kit thin , but i like factor . i find it works well me when i'm washing my long hair shower . i use it dump most water prior toweling it dry . if you don't like kind comb , go spend buck or two good , stiff comb or three . i wear full beard often neglect shaving my neck cheeks days , trimmer no comb great knock down stubble before i shave it	1

this gift my husband he loves it ! it gives himthe closest shave he ever electric razor andvery similar regular shave . price best , too .	1
this my second braun shaver . first one lowest model one blade . i loved them becuase i never cut my face their foil design . newer one definitely superior its design though . two blades make it faster shave . it washable , longer run one charge . it not too noisy so i don't wake up whole house . it sturdy compact travel box . carrying charging cable not big problem since it also very compact . moreover it not necessary take cable most times , since one charge most likely last longer than your trip . however braun design some limitations . first all , foils not sturdy . they bend lose form if you not careful where you put shaver it falls into sink instance . nice thing replacement foils available everywhere , affordable . problem foil design it extremely hard shave if your face moist . you'll wait bathroom dry up if you want shave after shower , since water vapor stick your face otherwise . even more important ( now i am re-experiencing , every year ) , humid summer day you need push shaver your face , since there no way dry skin . maybe it better fall back traditional razor such days , but i hate cutting myself so i just stay my braun . all put aside , i find one thing awkward . small button pops foil cleaning placed just bit above on/off button . sometimes ( when i'm not fully awake ) i accidentally push it see foil hit sink . so far ( after 3 years ) nothing happened foil because this , since it extremely light . but it still not best placement buttons . trimmer worked fine me . many people complaining it . so i'll try complain too . only thing i don't like trimmer space trimmer shaver hard reach brush cleaning . i guess i am too picky this last commen t.t o sum up , i love my braun shaver . it reliable long time . i'd give 4.5 stars if it possible	1
o.k. you buy cheap batteries , but not this razor . they nipple thats 3/8 " long fits up into razoryou cannot use conventional battriesin this razo	1
i bought this massager my husband who back leg pain . he panasonic massager 21 years finally gave up ghost , so we knew brand excellent . programs included massager especially helpful neck back which give him relief pain . only drawback sound it makes -- reminds him sounds mri . would definitely recommend it !	1
it such simple idea . take manual razor electric razor create hybrid electrical manual razor cheap price . forget buying any kind electrical razor or manual razor again . this thing works using single aaa battery ( worth investing some rechargable aaa batteries ) which slips into base pulling out end piece . just press green button razor starts vibrate . this vibration stimulates skin gets those hairs prick up little bit so razor blades ( all three baldes , i.e - mach iii/m3 ) catch better creating cleaner smoother cut . honest old mach iii model absolutely great but m3 power razor just upgrades razor into totally new device . there simply nothing market remotely resembles this kind product ... nothing . i would not hesitate sending anyone down local drug store $20 pick up this wonderful product ... quite frankly ... just making shaving enjoyable again	1
i knew when i bought this body fat monitor would just used rough estimate what actual number , so i wasn't really altogether surprised when i found out it 10% off . but , let face it , sensors feet which poor tester body fat percentage . great scale track your weights two different people based age height scale . i really impressed . i like this scale but it might more bells whistles than necessary might lead people astray believing they body fat higher or lower base their body fat percentage this machine alone . if you buy this product , just know it good place learn approximately where you but sure go gym or doctor it correctly	1
this toothbrush awesome !

i bought this item local grocery store . it great encouraging good eating habits ! it just right size keep cut up vegies dip fridge bring out each meal . we like it so much , we going buy least 4 more ( one each hubby i take work , cut up fruit home , third my sister who really likes ours ) . unfortunately store i bought first one doesn't them anymore , so i'm thrilled find them here amazon	1
this actually beautiful fountain looks much better than picture amazon . although it made plastic , it looks quite good much better than artificial grey slate type fountains . other reviewers mention , pump really quiet there nice flow water soothing when room quiet . i wind chimes outside two together very soothing . this fountain lights up lovely yellow illumination . dark room it quite attractive fits into even very upscale decor . cost them item low overall i think my 5 rating well-deserved	1
not much say besides fact they long life . i use them my boombox it sounds sane if i'me plugged into wall socket . i use these bateries all time	1
get this wonderful heating pad . you won't regret it . heats up fast very reasonable	1
i like cottonelle , but i prefere packages fill one container each , rathar than these larger packages	1
this stuff best !!! absolute must nursing moms !!!	1
this best cream i ever used . suggest it anybody .	1
i tried other less expensive brands , pampers still best one . these soft absorbent even overnight . overall , great product	1
my 2 yrs daughter likes dora prints this so much she chooses wear this pull ups rather than elmo pampers cruiser or underpants ( she now potty training ) . absorptivity wise easy ups not good cruiser	1
replacement heads norelco razor makes great shave . i haven't used electric razor years , figuring you could not get close shave . i wrong . norelco shaver awesome	1
desciption not mention product not used url coated lenses , which serious omission given many or even most eyeglass lenses coated	-1
use this face scrub pretty much every other day before bed also use nivea men face wash other days . i've using this routine year now my skin never looked better . after using face scrub my face felt comletely clean soft . i highly recommend this product	1
i love this heating pad . it so great heat up bed before i go sleep . i am able defrost my icy feet sleep soooo comfortably . best part it goes off after two hours so i don't worry burning my feet or burning down house . this second one i purchased . i first one many years i guess it just wore out . i used it almost every night colder months . i wish i not thrown it away because i found it it came very long warranty i might able replace it . this time i'll know	1
i would rated it five star , except control made overly complicated . i think ten settings heat then many settings how many hours two , four , six hours or continuous --- why make it so diffcult operate . instuctions , goodness , almost useless !	-1
this very inexpensive fountain i don't think it would realistic compare it other much more expensive models . it made out plastic , but it blend into decors easily long it not very close viewer . lighting quite beautiful you adjust flow water . price , i am quite happy it not think it much nosier than other more expensive models . pumps usually all same or very familiar . however , it very important keep water level up distilled water . if you don't this you get ruin pump , make it run nosier because wear , etc . i think it great fountain office or mood lighting bedroom . if you expensive furniture , you may want get something made out slate or better material .	1
it works just like it says like you would expect it . i can't ask anymore product	1
comparing multi-blade razors , mach iii best : far easiest clean , best balanced , most securely attached handle-to-head . these things -matter- , shaves otherwise fairly equal . if you must : i used double-edge ' safety ' razors years , before there -were- cartridges . if you tough hide , or master barber , fine , but regular guys continue get cut regular basis old style . mach iii shave you just close , you never get cut	1
1st wahl trimmer i purchased failed within few weeks . i posted my review amazon contacted soon after wahl representative . he offered opportunity change my opinion product sent me replacement unit free charge . i buy different brand trimmer when 1st failed but it wahl i depend everyday use . replacement trimmer doesn't cut short length i prefer . wahl 11 position guard more than adequate . i use level 1 cut that few days more than stubble look . i tried stubble guard but didn't really need it . battery life very good . i use trimmer 3-4 times week charge it after 3 weeks or so . it also used while it charged . i quite impressed someone wahl took time read user reviews their products personally respond . reason i purchased wahl trimmer because brand familiarity especially because my barber recommended it . my review based extended use replacement trimmer i am more than satisfied it . it less expensive than other brand i purchased it works great	1
my husband leaving more than 20 pairs reading glasses everywhere any where could still never find pair when he needed them .... even ead menu ! these glasses answer anyone who wears reading glasses . i bought them all colors him even bought pair work friend who works him(he loves them well bought more colors also ) . neither them lost pair all these months . they also started so many conversations . everyone who asked them same bought all colors . it takes little adjusting getting use but everyone we know never returned pair . only reason they returned order more colors or order friends loved ones ! these glasses fantastic ! thanks great service	1
i really enjoy my readers . i work health/computer field training among other things not worry carrying case when your arms loaded or misplacing them not able find them when needed . it so convenient just " click " them off when i'm . i asked them almost every where i go nurses work just love them . they very convenient .	1
i love idea glasses always where i find them . only problem they need also adjustable how wide band . every time i look up magnets pop apart . if they fix , i'd give them 5 stars !!	1
i really liked it first . it gave consistent readings clear easy understand . i wouldn't say i rough it all but somehow it broke . tab holds little door closed batteries broke off without any misuse .	-1
its easy use very clear instructions . got it delivered per scheduled time without any kind delay . thanks product	1
i use schick intuition razor . so , when gillette finally came out their version 2 1 razor , i excited try it . i like them both different reasons . intuition lasts longer my opinion cartridges less expensive . however , it bit bulky it difficult reach some areas . gillette breeze makes maneuvering more simplistic due it sleek style . moisture/shaving strips ran out after one shave . rate , it could become quite expensive replace blade . so - choice yours . which one fits your lifestyle best ? both products good 2 1 product makes my shaving experience bit more pleasurable less time consuming	1
i didn't personally use this but i bought it my mother who broken more expensive one . she said it worked perfect if not better than other one . she loved large display information it could hold 1 or 2 individual multiple readings . she especially likes all around automatic use . just touch one button machine inflate you . not complicated all . price excellent only $29.99 . i priced one wal-mart all auto-inflate digital blood pressure monitor cheapest they started $45 . very good buy amazon if i say so , well my mother	1
pros : handle weighted well . very close shave . less irritation than previous generations , even against grain . extra blade back = worth it . cons : 5 blades get gunked up quickly , requiring more passes . long surface area ( blade ) takes some getting used . expensive ; not compatible mach3 system . update :d own 2-3 stars . used razor two weeks found it not function well mach3 . if you not everyday shaver ( sometimes i don't shave weekends or holiday breaks ) you suffer significant beard-pull when you shave off those few days worth growth . also , i found i simply wasn't getting close shave i mach3 , even when shaving every day . i agree there less irritation , but only slightly so . i miss sideburn blade heft handle , but i'm happy i returned it purchased more blades my mach 3 power instead -- me , least , this wasn't improvement	1
nothing special report . toasty , no annoying auto-shutoff , cord plenty long	1
works advertised , except water phoenix so hard , i only get 3 uses instead 10 out cartridge . absolutely zero need towel dry car .	1
i like hot brush , i short hair which i blow dry use brush finish top . it quick , compact lets me finish quickly .	1
there no choice color shaver screen trim . one i replaced black ... new one i got amazon gray . it would nice know what color i getting , but not shown or selectable . other than cutter foil flawless , like all braun shaving products	1
this great product ! i first used this mirror my sister-in-laws house wrote down product number ... then went web . found amazon ! great those us over 50 yrs . old ! now i actually see put my makeup find my contacts when i lose one my eye ! my sisteen year old granddaughter loves well . i bought one her mother she " stole " it immediately telling her mom she needed it more ! we all love 5x mirror !	1
excellent precise trimmer , i even use it trimming sideburns . it , simply , best i ever owned .	1
my last set remington curlers , very similar this set , lasted over 10 years i very happy see they still made comparable model . curlers heat up quickly great job curling your hair . 2 different size curlers great different hair styles . i prefer original metal clips came my first set plastics ones this one not fit if you long hair . overall i would recommend this set someone shoulder length or short hair .	1
i've owned these curlers before . i tried some others before finding these amazon they didn't compare . you leave them 60 seconds or 5 minutes depending type curl you want . either way they always work great	1
it not worth $1.00 . you get better shave spoon . it no rpm . speed slow even when fully charged over 8 hours . blades not cut even little stubble . light no meaning , it tells you nothing battery supply or if it needs charged or running low . cord too short . good - battery last time , but how you tell .	-1
jut time i found best friend i look . amazing , friendly , powerful , excellent , brilliant , magnificent . i use it all time leave my face radiant . since i met this friend , i don't want continue any more friendship gillete razor . gillete razor my friend years , but norelco my princess now . wonderful !!! leave my face clean radiant . my motto : " clean face , happy face .	1
it good gift friends . i bought one my friend birthday gift , she likes it very much	1
once every two years i feel moved write positive review . this shaver incredible . i used high end norelcos years they what ford taurus too mercedes class ( panasonic ) . this real deal , some silly toy oozing gels nagging cleaning reminders . i noticed some reviewers still say they occasionally go back blade close shaves . i cannot imagine why . i run cleaning cycle every day no twin blade compare thorough 5 min shave this bad boy ( never used 3-4 blades ) . others mentioned , this shaver far less expensive other sites , but this good place review	1
it not often people take time write review something like electric shaver , but , this product truely deserves recognition . here what i found . i really tested them all ! i am very particular spending my hard earned something seems cheap or looks like it only cost $5 make overseas . so i generally tend gravitate higher/highest end product lines . i tested owned following:norelco newest speed xl 9170xlccnorelco spectra 8 james bond seriesnorelco cool shave nivea lotion dispenser built ( don't even bother!)braun 360 #8995 , made germany-their best model panasonic es8228 vortex nano triple blade hydrasystem ii - brookstone exclusive model but same es8168si tested all these over course 2 years . they all perform cleaning functions cleaning unit , or they rinsed under faucet . here resultsnorelco'snorelco newest speed xl triple blade system absolutely no better than spectra 8 ( james bond series ) or above . it may actually worse because smaller cutter sizes . it however provide comfortable shave norelco most known . it easy , smooth quiet . anyone use this shaver not get nicked . it pleasure hold almost makes you move circles which seems attack hair any angle . good - it just not shave close braun or panasonic . physics dictate , metal ringcups hold round blades just thick pull hair up clip hair below surface claimed . cleaning system huge not " intelligent " like braun . overall proven solid performer . braun 360 #8995this unit much better pivoting head design than past models very unique foil supposed grab hairs more effeciently - well , it definately provides closer shaver than previous models . this shaver however work . get really close shave you need follow their directions stretching pulling your skin tight . most guys this somewhat anyway , but really get close shave this unit expect work it , expect go over same area different directions . " bar " shaver just designed way , you provide attack path your beard . not bad things but certainly more work . expect get your closest shave after around 5 minutes leas t.t he braun loudest shaver bunch , fact annoying those house . motor truley slower than panasonic it shows . it clunky unit hold comparison norelco , panasonic . but , it definately shave closer than any norelco date . cleaning unit big bulky loud but very good job . replacement cleaner tanks way overpriced compared others . panasonic vortex nano system . i happen bought mine brookstone , yes i paid $50 premium their special color ( light beige/silver ) wood grain finger rests backlight lcd . it also smallest cleaning unit matches color shaver attractive . this keeps my wife happy since it not lot clutter , these cleaning units need stay put . true test closer shave amoungst unitsthere really only one way test units - shave 1/2 your face one unit , other 1/2 different shaver . i this many weeks . almost any shaver going feel pretty smooth after you first shave , you'll quickly notice which side closer end day or next morning . great test - i this too ! shave your face one brand , then immediately shave your face again unit . i absolutely guarantee these panasonic vortex nano shave you even closer after shave . you notice this " sound " your beard cut . it absolutely amazing !!! design engineering wins panasonicthree technologies seem completely advanced panasonic compared anyone else . they motor speed , 30 degree blade angle nano blade sharpening . here my results : 1 . fastest linear motor 13,000 rpm patented , it makes big difference . 2 . super quiet compared braun same norelco3 . entire head goes out pivots left right . this great because you push harder without fear ruining cutter foil or nicking yourself . 4 . cutter head slightly " curved " which makes big differnce when moving circular attack . 5 . no vibration incredibly speed , comfortable hold6 . cleaning unit small fast efficient . uses water much larger tank than anyone else cleaning detergent cartridge that lot less money than anyones . hey , anyone sell you alchohol cartridge , this much smarter , cleaner , more economical . 7 . while road , you clean unit simply pumping ordinary liquid soap onto head while it running , let it suds up , then rinse off let dry . how cool ! 8 . yes , it used shower if you want . these units well sealed well madewell , i hope helps you save time money . you could easily get this same unit amazon under different model just make sure it following : 1 . nano blade technology - much sharper polishing system their blades2 . vortex ( convex blades foil)3 . hydaclean system iimake shaving fun again , go buy one .	1
it nice . small strong . my father used this one 4 months .	1
it get tension stress out your muscles . worth just try it	1
size makes it easy directly pinpoint secific areas massage heat option die . only downside manual it says not use it more than 15 minutes continuously so motor doesnt overheat it numbs your hand after you use it strongest vibration setting . overall its great purchase someone occasional sore muscle exercise .	1
i bought this iron after reading some negative reviews here . i love it . i non problems others say they . my hair perfectly smooth after using it , which hard my thick , curly hair . i even friends try it they agree it awesome . it pricey , but worth it if you hard straghten hair	1
i fence spending money this iron i am glad i . i still dry my hair almost all way but i don't worry styling brush . iron might add minimal amount time getting ready but my hair never looked better . my hair wavy i driven my friends family crazy over years complaining how hard it style . i used curling irons flat irons straighten my hair -spent more time ok results . this product i love my hair . it looks straight but still body -like i paid professional my hair . your hair get caught plates if you too quick/careless but i think any iron	1
i love these glasses . they always there when i need them ... hanging around my neck ready me put them place . only problem i experienced related application i am using them ... my shop . i got 3.00 so i could good close up look when necessary . however , i've noticed when i'm actively working around project getting myself different positions related object my work , glasses often separate where magnets positioned bridge glasses causing me clear both hands tools or whatever them reconnect lenses . it exasperating , but you've got able see your work . this design flaw product clearly doesn't apply most people situation . some might argue my head just too big ! while i may big ego , my head actually slightly smaller than average . this problem could likely corrected manufacturer extending each temple one inch give glasses more room expand before breaking apart . but important thing you know i'd still buy these glasses all over again . they really terrific	1
whenever i am out i my glasses around my neck . funny thing when i go put them i pull them apart . this makes everyone jump ! thinking i just broke my glasses lol too funny . then when they see how they work they all want pair . i know i could spokes person this company . excellent product very well made i mine years no complaints ever	1
little bigger bulkier wider band than i expected but still comfortable effective . i seem sleep better when i use it .	1
this great , everyday shampoo . i fine hair i find it leaves it soft shiny , without weighing it down . it got great scent . i would definitely recommend this product . it worth it	1
job 50 bucks its great deal	1
i back/shoulder pain recently ordered this product two weeks ago . i really love it because it works great me . after couple runs rolling/kneading ( well , they call it shiatsu ) perfect pressure , my back feel relieved . cons : it too short reach my upper shoulder . suggest homedics redesign it , maybe hood shape allows massager roll upper shoulder lower back .	1
this shaver my first shaver i got it when i 15 . i really like it because it gives me close shave doesn't irritate my skin hardly all . trimmer side almost useles , but rest system outstanding . it doesn't take long charge hold charge long time . it great option anyone buy i highly recomend it	1
while i am far expert nutritional suppliments , this one seems work advertised ( although , all i know , it could also simply placebo effect ! )	1
i feel guilty just drinking this stuff . i got cookie cream i mixed it soy milk man , tastes like real thing , even cookie clumps . i actually enjoy drinking this shake before after my workout which weird first because it tastes sooo good !! only using it few days so i can't comment results just yet . i just post how this best tasting protein shake i ever tasted ! i strawberry milkshake way too . if you amazon prime , free 2-day shipping + no tax = can't beat price anywhere else . ordered wed morning got it thursday afternoon !	1
i always track my reps weight i lift , since taking muscle milk i've consistently outperformed my plateaus . i've great gains , i lift more , taste awesome ! i highly recommend it i'll definitely buying more	1
my friend used this razor two months he loves it . he enjoys smooth quiet close shave , loves trimmer , design . his only small complaint shave little slow his ultimate dream . however , he hyper type personality so i'm not sure razor slow since he everything super sonically . thanks norelco ! you made me look good	1
i've always wary electric razors , but i say this one works pretty well me . it took no time my face get " used " this razor ( past it hell try get through couple weeks other kinds ) . first day i used it i got nice , close shave no irritation . single charge lasts me couple weeks , so even though i've brought charger me when traveling i've never use it ( i'll leaving it home next time ) . i haven't actually used cleaning system yet , because you run entire razor under hot water clean it out no problem . i just leave it counter dry until i come home work . my only complaint would like most other people ( all other electric razors i know ) it doesn't get all those hard get hairs my neck without several passes , trimmer doesn't get close enough my sideburns . not problem though , i just keep disposable razor shower touch up --- just few seconds no lather so not big deal . i would recommend this product anyone looking make switch	1
unlike other reviewer , i love taste vanilla . but then , i mix it orange juice so it tastes like orange julius	1
i recently plesantly surprised get bottle light blue gift it totally made my day because i down last 1/5 my last summer bottle sooner i would bought new one anyway . this how much i love this perfume . talking mind reading ! thank you , dg , creating this refreshing masterpiece	1

perfectly honest this make my hair grow alot . im not really surprised because it contains alot amino acids which help hair growth naturally anyway . after month using it everyone i mean everyone saw difference length my hair . only advice i would give not take many pills it says take . they say bottle take like 3 pills day each bottle . which really my opinion not healthy so i only took 1 pill day each bottle- aminos , herbal other bottle . i took it like 3 weeks straight my hair shiny , long strong . when you take one pill day each bottle instead 3 not only it healthier but pills last longer lol . but it good investment	1
i chose this shaver after reading number owner reviews . after using it few weeks , i find it well deserving glowing comments those reviews , it far exceeds claims marketers . well , braun .	1
fast shipping , they kept me updated shipping status , product exactly described , excellent price , i`m very satisfied this purchase . keep up this excellent service guys !!!	1
i bought this toothbrush because it gold box savings needed replace my other oral . i am so happy it . my teeth feel " squeaky clean " after using it it doesn't " tickle " my gums like sonicare . it great battery life two different speeds . after few weeks , my teeth look whiter i lot less plaque my last dental appointment . my husband dentist started use more deluxe , but similar , version this ( digital timer , 4 speeds , some other aesthetic nuances ) also very pleased . fact , he likes it so much he starting give them away his new patients !	1
this unit great ! it well made , takes up minimal space , it gives me peace mind my toothbrush clean ! i also keep dental pick tongue scraper there well . i imagine my toothbrush getting tan everyday ... only thing i found , it it not fit sonicare head there . but it 3 small toothbrush holders one larger hole like wider handled tongue scraper etc ... i love it ! no bacteria hanging out my toothbrushes	1
i like way this cream gives instant glow noticed difference next morning too . mine dry sensitive skin cream works well . very nice smell	1

i using these flosser piks few years . waterpik flosser recommended my dentist because my teeth very close together traditional flossing takes lot time . waterpik flossers i'm able floss very quickly mornings . my teeth cleaning experiences much , much better now i use flossers .	1
i skeptical buying this first , but after seeing it allure , reading various reviews amazon , i decided try it . i say , i pleasantly surprised ; it what it says . it won't work cyctic acne or if pimple already come head . it work pimples just beginning .. those hard , tender knots deep under your skin you just know going huge day or two . i've used it two pimples red bumps , both mostly gone within 24 hours . completely gone less than 3 days . usually it would taken 7-10 days them go away , it would ugly	1
ok , let me preface this saying i am one biggest skeptics you'll ever meet . i don't easily fall new fads , miracle cures , or anything seems too good true . this said , i am completely love this product feel it helped boost my immune system 100% . unfortunately , i am not health-conscious i should . i am overweight , bit addiction mcdonald cheeseburgers , maybe exercise once or twice week . it all seemed catch up me last thanksgiving when i got hit cold . no big deal , i get them couple times year . then , right before christmas , i got cold . i very put-out , but just figured it my bad luck . february rolls around brings it cold #3 . i missed quite bit work getting very concerned something else might wrong . i developed slight fever , but it all went away one week . i hoped it all over i just unfortunate cold season . when i got back work , i spoke one my co-workers , " emily , " who self-proclaimed health-nut . she would always brag she " never got colds . " i would cringe tell her ) not tempt fate ) stop rubbing it . she swore this " green food " powder she drank every day her lemonade . it looked like finely cut grass , i assumed that what it . i told her she nuts , she hadn't gotten cold because she lucky , she ate really well , ran every morning . i let her fix me some powder tried mix it up my tea . it horribly , it felt like i drinking , well , finely cut grass . it didn't bad taste , but texture grotesque . i told her i'd take my chances . well , here comes march , it , new cold . this time i desperate . emily told me go health store look some green foods capsule form . i so , although i couldn't find brand she taking capsule form ( green vibrance ) , i find greens plus . it seemed lot similar ingredients , so i went ahead bought it ($40 ! ) . whatever , i figured this my last-ditch effort before hauling myself down doctor . i took 4 pills night , , i swear , woke up next morning feeling ok . it like i knocked my cold out before it really got started . i elated , but still not convinced . i sure it could coincidental , but after four months four colds , i really didn't care . i took 3 these pills every morning ( you take up 12 ) , colds didn't come back . twice since then , i've felt " scratchy throat " feeling you get when cold coming , i'll up my dosage 4 , twice day . i'm always fine next day . colds flying around my office , but emily i still ( knock wood ) healthy . i've since little internet research individual ingredients , but am still not sure what it helping . maybe it just placebo effect . i haven't any other benefits product claims like increased energy , stamina , etc ., but i also haven't gotten cold . i am faithful believer it now . maybe it just snake oil maybe it all due placebo effect . but seriously , i don't care . i haven't cold while , so i'm happy . i would recommend this product anyone .	1
i purchased these after seeing physician friend mine using them . i absolutely recommend these any active person who needs reading glasses ready . i clip them morning use them off throughout day never misplace them . i purchased these gifts other professional people . one pair i purchased bit narrow temples . i heated back band hair dryer gave them little side side pull , placed them they fit just fine . if you particularly large person this may necessary	1

i dealing w/ pain planters factitious while now . it pain stretch every morning or night , especially w/ full time job 2 children under 3 . however , i leave this thing next my bed stretch first thing am last thing pm it works very well . i first started using it while pt found all other stretches they me , this one seemed like most productive felt most effective .	1
naturally , my hair wavy , very thin strands but piles piles it . my hair somewhat difficult when it comes straightening -- usually it looks fine when i leave house , but comes completely undone after four hours . so , when my last conair straightener broke , i went out invested my money this one . overall , it okay . it straightened my hair one stroke , which rare me . however , it seemed just suck all moisture out my hair , leaving it extremely dry dull ( which definitely not good vegan such myself , since my hair already dry enough ! ) . movements clumsy this , i occasionally snagged my hair or burned myself due plates unexpectedly shifting toward me . it didn't break , it still going just strong day i first bought i t.t his straightener problems dealing smaller amounts hair , or fine " baby hairs " around my forehead . sadly , it couldn't keep my side bangs straight save its life -- they wavy ever two hours after i'd straightened it . this straightener most minimal job -- least it straightens your hair somewhat -- but save your pennies straightener more worthwhile .	-1

this metrx protein powders my favorites , though when amazon this brand stock it less expensive per serving than metrx . metrx foams up bit more seems little thicker ( not negatives , my opinion ); twinlab comes out very smooth when made blender . both brands taste very good , least when made fat free or 1% milk ( or very least half milk half water ) . i won't detail nutritional info because it available product description here , but like metrx i like this protein powder gets almost all its calories protein . some protein powders fair amount fat some lot carbohydrates . those formulas may good competition level bodybuilders who need extremely high caloric intake because they working out so hard , but i don't really want protein shake gives me meal worth carbs fat addition protein . i'd rather get my carbs fat real food	1

wonderful inhalation steamer sinus conditions . i plagued bad chronic sinus conditions past 16 years miserable . four surgeries still problems . countless antibiotics , steroid sprays tablets , etc . daily treatments morning evening mabis use neilmed sinus rinse saline packets finally given me my life back quite productive state again . mabis puts out very necessary copious amounts steam where other steamers i owned failed . key mabis concentrates steam where necessary , into nasal passages via small nasal mask . however , it would improvement if mabis would provide nasal adapter ( such nebulizers have)that directs steam straight into nostrils instead small mask which allows steam affect entire nose area . angled chimney inhaler makes it easier use . however , it too could improved use flexible tube or least little more angle so unit easier use while sitting upright instead hunch over . they should also include more than one misting orifice because saline mixes hard water tend clog very tiny hole mister . mabis supply small cleaning tool ( wire ) ream out clogged orifice . if you significant sinus trouble this unit best thing you find . i used several different devices including kaz ( no longer made ) , vicks ( too little steam not effective , facial type rather than sinus device ) . vicks vaporizer use towel(works but very hot brutal face ) . i used essential oils like cinnamon , clove , thyme , tea tree kaz unit obtained some relief but mabis saline mix really most beneficial . it doesn't cure anything but it sure brings some quality life back . i can't recommend this device enough . it very portable easily packed taken trips . i used it my van inverter recent long trip which very convenient . i also use it my sailboat . it utilizes very small amount water which makes it simple use mobile fashion . it easy clean well . i suffer 24/7 chronic sinus , countless doctors , taken all types meds , multiple surgeries this little machine tiny fraction cost big player my regaining some quality life . neilmed sailine packets convenient work well unit , i use third packet each mabis session . i no interest whatsoever neilmed . it just convenient sailine product i found drugstore it helped , so you should know it . mabis best steamer you ever use , don't waste your $$$ other feeble steamers like i .	1
i steam inhaler some years ago , kaz therasteam . i problems my sinuses , it didn't help much . i spent years , some money , attempting solutions my sinus problem , insufficient success . it getting better over years , but every now then i still wake up after 5 or 6 hours sleep can't fall back asleep unless i inhale steam -- hot shower sometimes works , but it basically means getting up up while , which no help if it less than two hours before time i'm supposed get up anyway . i shopping new humidifier , not finding much , when it occurred me there might better steam inhaler than one i used . i came amazon looked around , decided mabis . i am glad i ! this item definitely job , giving off copious amounts hot wet steam , which perfect remedy my dry burnt-feeling sinuses . you even adjust it kind steam you want ! my only quibble it says instructions operating time 6-9 minutes ; it seems closer around 15 , which ok me . main thing , because this device , i've gotten some sleep i otherwise would missed .	1

i picked this sonic toothbrush local brooks . just curiosity . it very cheap compare other sonic toothbrush.it felt strange first . since i own other oral-b oscillating toothbrushes there pretty good scrubbing teeth . sonic toothbrush not seem move much , i think , how could it clean my teeth . after couple days , it start think it manual toothbrush , i used it scrubbing back forth my teeth ... it felt very afterward . trick think it regular toothbrush . move it back forth , gently lightly . i use this conjunction waterpik my teeth felt like i just saw dental hygienist getting my teeth cleaned . it far superior than oscillating type , even expensive ones . battery not last very long . so you travel charger . but you can't beat price this quality . - 5 stars	1

i disappointed scale . it needs stored flat , so i can't store it sideways cabinet i intended . lcd screen blocked bowl , angle makes it difficult read . it weigh oz , but not lb oz . therefore , any item weighing more than 1 lb requires you math . order return item i would not reimbursed orgininal shipping i would pay it shipped them . other words costing nearly cost scale itself .	-1
this my first epilator . i love this product . many years i shaving my legs get rid hairs . first it ok but eventually i started getting razor burns i lost smoothness my legs . i totally upset . i trying something different finally i found out good product which completely worth amount i spent . it not so costly . it simply awesome . i love i t.t here no much pain . pain during epilating really very less . anybody bear it . i highly recommend this product	1
epilator what i bought it . it removed hair , painless ( i am long time epilator user , though ) . it so painless , i used only below knees but ventured thighs arms , it worked fine . even tough ones came off after few passes . my first epilator epilady , which fine . it died after 3-4 years , i bought emjoi foreverfree spending over $100 , but it didn't work all . i so discouraged didn't want waste any more money , so fixed my old epilady myself used it 10 years or so . it finally got point it not effective removing hair , so i bought this one . this worth money spent . only thing , which very minor , motor seems bit too loud , head comes off too easily . i can't remember what i make head come off when i didn't mean it , but it didn't come off while removing hair , so i think it ok	1
my wife liked this hair straightener . she tried some her friends expensive once she says she really liked it	1

i actually bought this my dentist lot cheaper . but i found this toothbrush better than my previous one ( sonicare 4800 pro ) . if it wasn't battery dieing , i would still using it . lasted me good 3-4yrs . so i needed new one . wasn't keen new design narrow brush head all since coming larger one older model . after months deliberation , decided go 9800 model . it 2 weeks now since i it . i love bristles this model , their not flat , which really helps getting food out my teeth . which also nice neck thin angled , which i'm able ( finally ) reach back my teeth all around . battery lasts like sonicare says , approx 2 weeks . i'm sure they could used better longer lasting battery . oh well ... i'm happy ! update 1 : i actually got up 3 weeks single charge . that even brushing 2x day full 2 minutes . previous i assumed when i saw yellow light , would only got 1 or 2 brushing out it , but it kept going extra week	1
very unusual fragrance grows you . because it not typical mellow floral or sexy musk fragrances , one hard time identifying it or figuring out what think it . thing not try pigeon-hole fragrance . just enjoy it ! it starts off this very different exotic lush fragrance but then after time mellows out very sexy floral-y smell . ( me anyway ) but it lasts hours . so use sparingly . other reviewer stated , you wear it know . not my favorite fragrance ( hence 4 stars ) but definitely one smells good sets me apart !	1
i bought this my husband just under year ago ( might i add it $35 less back then too , how dare they increase price same older product ? ) he loved it . he used it shave his beard everyday close enough shave make both myself his air force career happy . only problem battery charger not charge battery any longer , obviously he can't use it without battery . charger not even register shaver there anymore it well cared . such shame . i can't find replacement charger , so it looks like it back old three blade disposable razor cream us . i can't afford spend $100 something won't last even year when $4 pack disposables lasts him two months . very dissapointed quality this product . other than , it great razor smooth , clean results almost close regular razor , but there slight difference someone who fast growth and/or coarse beard may shave more often . main advantage it lot quicker used or out shower . but if you want something last longer than 10 months , wary this product .	-1
i bought this shaver march 2006 , = = = $69.00 = = = amazon . i read some reviews decided buy extra packets shaving lotion vs . gel . i agree everyone who stated preference . this my first experience any kind electric shaver , so you may wish take my review small grain sal t.t he shaver itself decent . i find my closest shave still blade razor , but curly hair leading razor burn ingrown hairs . i get reasonably close shave without burn . it miss hairs sometimes but if you go back forth enough you eventually catch it all . note : if you're like me only shave every couple days don't let your hair get too long or shaver won't able pick it up . it best shaving stubble . my one real complaint sturdiness . i've removed one star off rating this . i've dropped it couple times shower , ( after all it wet slippery ) few pieces popped off . everything snapped back together all right , but it feel kind cheaply made	1
pros : effective cleans off easily . cons : may leave dry skin . just use face lotion afterward	1

i'm sure my experience not norm , but its probably not uncommon either . i absolutely hate this stuff . just every eye doctor gives it away , probably because alcon gives it them free . you get what you pay . apparently , quite few people allergic this stuff get stinging or dry eye . i'm definitely one them . if you can't wear contacts long you want , definitely try something different	-1

when i got this razor last christmas , it my first electric razor ( i previously using mach 3 ) . i annoyed my old razor because i devote time getting my face ready before , take time clean my face afterwards , i looking forward razor i could just use . when i started using this razor , i noticed i either didn't get very close shave or i pushed too hard irritated face , even after using large quanity lotion several weeks usage . i discovered , however , using shower changed everything . using no lotion , i able obtain closer shave than my mach 3 no irritation . battery life , i typically get 3 ~ 4 good shaves out it before i recharge it which more than enough me . i yet use gel , but so i can't really vouch it , but my experience , if you use this shower you probably won't need it anyways . overall i would probably give it 4.5 because i don't like using it out shower much , but shave i get shower makes me round up 5 .	1
i'm not using gel - it expensive doesn't worth it . instead i'm using regular shaving gel shaving very good me . i'm usually using it shower	1

i've this razor few months , it gives great , close shave . my only issue product battery life fails live up its promises . it claims 25 minutes cordless shaving , but my personal experience closer half . i don't travel much , so razor usually just stays plugged bathroom , but i am still disappointed philips norelco makes such exaggerated claim its product . despite this , i am quite pleased product whole	1
i've used norelco shavers years i like them . after 4 years my most recent norelco stopped holding charge , so i picked up this one . pros : * it gives great shave ! they've changed heads bit added some holes . whatever it , my shave 30% smoother better than my older norelco less time . * it quiet . i actually conversation my wife while shaving . this wasn't possible my older shaver . * it significanly lighter than my older model . * cleanup really easy . you just flush head hot water once week . once month or so you're supposed take out shaving disks head brush them clean but my guess once quarter would plenty . since cleanup major hassle , this terrific feature . cons : * it takes 8 hours charge . yikes ! eight hours . my old shaver never took over hour . * it hard tell how much charge you left . my older model gas gauge type indicator right front . this one just green light goes when you turn razor . when it runs low juice you'll get flashing red light when you finish shaving . this isn't nearly handy . * shape isn't ergonomic other model probably because water rinsing feature . there little plastic fins stick out handle presumably help you hold when it wet . it doesn't feel very good your hand . * there no case store it . this drawback if you use it travel . * head supposed replaced once year . huh ??? this apparently case all new norelco shavers . these heads aren't cheap , folks . i certainly wouldn't replace one unless i problems shaver -- then i'd probably buy new one . bottom line i'm very pleased this shaver . it job very well it quite inexpensive . i would certainly recommend this model over higher end models if price consideration	1
this best dispenser we used . it attches wall easily , eay fill constructed such way it multiple uses . we purchased smaller ones give gifts-knowing others would like it also .	1
although this marketed dog towel , it appears exactly same size quality their bath towels , just different colour . their regular bath towels come very boring colours , this nice deep red . towel itself , i love them . they absorbent they say , they lightweight ( great traveling ) easy wash , either hand they dry quickly , or washer , where they leave no lint dryer like ordinary towels . i highly recommend them	1
i received this product christmas gift 2006 unfortunately it broke march 2007 . i like it its small size , folding capability , retractable cord , but i really only able use it three months before it just wouldn't turn any more . also , it only comes one attachment straight hair but not curly hair . i like it ok time i it , but since it stopped working completely , i can't give it great review .	-1
this very good hair dryer although bit heavy . retractable cord folding handle real plusses . i take it gym several days week , i no trouble fitting it into my bag . it also seems not dry out my hair but leave it fuller	1
this wondereful product . i hesitant order because price so great but read other reviews decided go it . it worked wonders myself my husband . my husband 215 pounds muscle it really helped him well	1
i so suprised see price amazon offered this . i shopped around lot find this exact massager my dad because it same kind his chiropractor using , amazon price far less than anywhere else . we very pleased this . like some others said heat not great , but amazon special price it cost no more than one without heat , so no harm trying it . definately no other complaints item .	1
when i first started working out i just bought regular gnc brand protein it ok but i really didn't want drink it so i gradually left weightlifting scene behind . now i'm back it i read some reviews decided buy this brand but unfortunately gnc only double chocolate ( not choc fan ) but i bought it anyways . i just use water since i can't tolerate milk well it still taste amazing i don't even like chocolate all much . i shake mine never problem clumping or anything . there other products lot more protein per serving but why down shake taste like [ ... ] once day when you drink this every meal more . order vanilla next since flavor my favorite so hopefully it taste just good . buy amazon , gnc too expensive .	1
i started buying protein shakes back high school one after they tasted disgusting !! you couldn't wait get it down pain actually any stuff hit your tastebuds ... uggh ! so i looked online found out optimum nutrition supposedly makes good tasting whey protein powders . well they aren't just good , they're actually grrreeaat ! this only type protein i've bought since then . chocolate best flavor they expanded it mint chocolate , double rich chocolate , chocolate shake , creamy chocolate , now " extreme " chocolate . basically , if you buy chocolate flavored optimum nutrition shake , you're getting best tasting protein out there price , hands down .	1
24g protein per scoop thats not counting milk . i it over 2 months i haven't gotten tired taste ; fact , its pretty damn good . there no need add anything it make it taste tolerable , it really taste great . i use vanilla soy milk couple ice cubes mix it blender . perfect every time	1

this perfect scale weighing pinewood derby cars .	1
norelco 7745x works advertised ... i've only it few weeks though . cleaning easy it shaves close . colors little bit loud .	1
i bought this shaver my boyfriend christmas this year , i really nervous because he never used electric shaver i really wanted him like it , even though i bought one mid-price range . i thought this would perfect because he shaves shower , i didn't realize most shavers aren't use out shower . he used it four times , even though manual says it takes around 3 weeks your face adjust , so far it wonderful . he fairly corse , stubbly black hair needs shaved often , but this razor , his face feels just smooth i'm used . he says it doesn't get quite close if he shave up down razor , but it not huge difference , we won't returning it . i think it definitely worth price i paid amazon , i hope it becomes available again so other people opportunity try it .	1
wow ! thats all i say . former braun 360 user , i assure you this razor works better than braun foil shaver . very impressive results . it close mach 3 if you only shave grain when you us mach . if you save against grain , this might not good enough you	1
excellent quality product very durable . only reason why i gave it 4 stars instead 5 .. what up case they give you tweezers ? way too small tweezers barely fit there	1
wahl medalist fantastic clippers black men , bald men bald black men or almost bald men who want stay clean . used everyday close clean shave . i get no or very few ingrown hairs . great price usually $10 $16 . but clippers hard find . same place sold me my first pair hasn't sold clippers since	1
i've purchased other products interactive health , including ijoy ( which amazing compared other massage chairs i've tried ) , their ottoman 2.0 ( which hits spot calves wonderfully ) . i bought this hopes get same quality effect i their other products , but disappointed . two massaging handles either side pillow massage sides my neck well , but doesn't hit back my neck all -- that where my sore spot always tends ! " pillow " itself hard uncomfortable , so you position your head carefully order really relax . i wouldn't recommend purchasing this massager its expensive price . however , should you find this massager sale , it decent product . i'm still pursuit more effective neck massager , though ..	-1

my other ( brand ) hot hair brush ' comb style ' type ; this my first ' brush style ' . my preference harder comb style over brush style . it seems hair type , thickness , etc . would certainly play big factor - my hair thick course . this brush style works ... it smooths hair , adds volume , curl ; it just takes bit more effort ' hold hair ' or get ' through hair ' because brush bristles not strong enough go through thick hair . this very good choice , i am not disappointed this product . if you thick or course hair , understand you should use smaller sections styling ; ' lift ' - just holding curling brush under hair close scalp works pretty good ... bad side ... if you don't pay attention , your hair get caught removeable brush handle	1

my wife i bought this chopper love it ! we frustrated electric choppers because they tended turn everything into mush . this chopper creates perfectly sized cuts ( especially our favorite - quesadillas ! ) handle large size pieces . example , i use this onions , but also bell peppers . you approx . quarter chop bell pepper place it ( unseeded ) press - then give it definitive push walah ! i not suggest putting half-onion ( shown picture ) , cutting food surface fairly flat makes big difference . i recommend using it flat surface , it require little extra push ( hence " bubble " top " press here " type button ) . we not experienced any trouble it breaking or too difficult ( we've it 1 year ) - although we lose cleaning piece , so it takes little more effort clean now . ( hope this helps ! ) my husband says , " it what its suppose ... saves time ... it works . " you push end chopper not middle	1

i bought few boxes these odwalla bars january 2007 approximately = = = $22.00 /box = = = during amazon special $10 off promotion . price two boxes these bars came out $35.00 after discount . price one these bars retail stores almost -never- dips below $1.50 bar . so 48 bars , you'd paying $72.00 plus tax . you see , if you know you like these bars plan eat lot them , now time stock up . especially free shipping . product , bars themselves excellent . i eat these daily work where i'm too busy make myself breakfast , i find it takes edge off perfectly until i'm ready lunch . i'm especially fan berriesgomega choc . chip peanut flavors . they both delicious flavor , good texture , much healthier ( not mention mostly organic ) than many other so called " health " bars out there ( hooah ! etc ) , taste far better than anything else i've tried . bonus , these bars shipped out quickly ; i received them within 5 business days my order . 5 stars	1
sleeping memory foam like no other experience . it soft but not like cotton padding . it really conform your body limbs . i notice chemical smell which went away first day . no biggy . it slip off my mattress easily . if i fix it , it slips again same night ( not completely , just 6 " ) . i didn't get quilted cover which may prevent happening . animal hair sticks memory foam like glue so keep it covered . free pillow very small not useful sleeping . kids could use it but i use it while watching tv - very comfy . i bought memory foam topper because i condition called costocondritis ( inflamation muscles ribs ) . my ribcage terrible pain night when i'm trying sleep . i found i fine when i sleep something soft so i thought memory foam would help . it really hasn't i think it because when i'm laying it my weight flattens it my surface area becomes hard my mattress . i am 100lbs overweight so i think that why . i think i just buy softer mattress use this one my hide-a-bed my guests ( oh , lose weight ! ) . still , i don't regret buying it . bottom line , if you heavy like me , topper flatten you won't experience memory foam softness except your limbs . maybe thicker one would work better . buy cover because it " scoot " off your mattress cover protect it animal hair . my children think it feels like cloud lay i recommend it average weight person	1
think carefully before purchasing this item . it so very soft , but chiropractors tell you softness not what needed people who suffer lower back problems . you sink so deeply into this thing , it like sleeping candy floss . after i started using it , every day i would wake up sore lower back , which i thought must related something else . finally , expaseration i removed mattress topper reverted my old , firm ikea mattress . back pain gone immediately . this foam topper really doesn't provide enough support - it ' cradles ' you , indeed , but it healthier your spine sleep firmest surface you find comfortable . there no point sending it back refund - time they deduct ( exorbitant ) shipping fees , 20% ' service fee ' , shipping you pay return , you'll nothing left .	-1

if you extreme pain your neck , shoulders , upper back , this excellent product . i degenerative cervical disc disease ms so this product helps ease pain throughout day but expecially morning . forget rectangular pads $20 , this worth every penny . my generates more heat typical low , med , high selections most heating pads . moist heat ability go up 166 degrees . though it dry heat option i can't imagine ever using it because moist heat really penetrates below surface bring you relief . my only complaint cord should extend front flaps not back one . it little annoying but overall worth small inconvenience every penny i paid it	1

reviewer wachsmuth krogmann thomas tank engine , clear little plastic piece designed light up tank fell into tank after third time we filled it . then water leaked everywhere , including onto electronics . apparently plastic simply glued into tank even slightest touch it falls back inside . when you place tank back onto thomas this piece fits over other clear plastic piece houses actual bulb light . this apparently enough cause piece loosen fall into tank . there no way fix this or any warning not touch it . course normal filling its almost guaranteed you touch this some time . i dont know you , but mixing toddlers , water electricity recipe disaster !! children should never allowed anywhere near this product !! this major defect safety hazard !!!! product should recalled !!!	-1
this " cane " great . if you want relieve pressure your back ( or anywhere , really ) this it ! i love it take it me everywhere i go . i highly recommend this	1
i love thera cane ! i've muscle-related back problems over 10 yrs . however , last 2 yrs really bad . i've chiropractor , massage , acupuncture nothing stuck - plus i got tired spending all money them . first time i used thera cane i almost cried !! within 20 minutes i completely pain free . it such long time since i could move around w/o pain . although pain came back , each session it gets less pain-free time gets longer . i believe i've broken cycle . i just used it morning before work , then after work then before bed . if your pain muscle-related , thera cane well worth it !	1
i looking dryer use after swimming came across this one . i already own panasonic ionic dryer so i looking something preferrably smaller carry locker room use after swimming . size this dryer just right my bag . arm bendable so not take up more space lengthwise . i like this dryer because it ionic it dries my hair up really fast after washing my hair . my hair pretty silky afterward too . this overall good travel size dryer . only complaint i switch .. sometimes it rather difficult switch it off after drying my hair . dryer seasaw-like switch off middle , low setting above high setting below . therefore , too much pressure put switch push switch either above or below not middle which switch it off . otherwise , good buy	1
great second one so good i bought spare case this model taken out production	1
we've using these garbage bags year now they mostly live up claim their strength . we went using cheapest kitchen size garbage bags these after getting deal them local grocery store . cheap bags , i would frequently problems bag ripping when removing trash or fear bottom would fall out bag when filled lots heavy items . i not any these problems these bags . i packed these bags maxiumum capacity no problems . my one complaint area around very top bag susceptible damage , particularly tie top . when i am tying up full bag , oftetimes orange tie built into bag begin rip through bag . this not caused any major issues so far so i don't think it big deal . also , area around top bag weaker plastic lacks flexibility rest bag , so if you removing overfilled bag trashcan , you must use some care . overall these great garbage bags i highly recommend them .	1
positive side , i liked design this groomer well nice storage box . i not experience any problem attaching/removing attachments , like other reviewers . terms actually using this groomer trimming , i'm quite disappointed . i bought this trimmer hoping trim my beard very short . it seems spacers not meant used short beard , since they not trim it . other hand , using trimmer without any spacer , almost shaves my beard completely not what i want . major drawback this groomer battery drains too quickly . more importantly , when battery empty , even if groomer attached wall socket it not bypass battery but rather tries recharge it again which course hopeless when using trimmer	-1
i bought this my husband because he likes keep his facial hair trimmed i found this product . price very reasonable , if you let it charge overnight it keeps it charge long enough perform whatever function you need it . i surprised see other customers who dissatisfied product . my husband loves it i am buying one my grown son his birthday	1

i tried 5-6 hair trimmers , mostly nose hair . they all worthless -- until i found micro trimmer . this little puppy works perfectly . i given up finding good trimmer pulling nose hairs out tweezers . periodically , i would get infection sometimnes lasted over week very painful . i read it also dangerous . micro trimmer takes just few seconds it great job . it ok eyebrows other places , but standard clippers or scissors work better there . only downside it cheaply made . it falls apart it gets stuck . falling apart nuisance . when it gets stuck , i stick razor blade or fingernail teeth move blade slightly . this usually frees it . if not , replace battery . i own 4-5 so i one home , office , car , spares . they cheap they work . i would normally rate something made this poorly 1 or 2 , but sucker works so well i give it 4 .	1
this great conditioner . i super fine hair , after using this , shampoo , i find my hair super soft , shiny not all weighed down . it also great , clean smell , which i love . i would definitely recommend it	1

maybe i high pain tolerance , b/c i didn't find this product painful . it works very well-if hair missed , i just go back over it . much more effective , time saving , less messy than waxing . i've only used it twice but my hair already growing much sparser . i like fact it rechargable , so you more flexibility . i would definitely recommend it , but it seems it really painful some people . however , i think you might get used it over time . i guess if you tolerate waxing , then this might same terms pain factor . maybe pulling your skin very taut might help	1
i ordered source life because i wanted try liquid instead deal so many bottles different vitmains minerals . i dont ' swallow so many pills ... just one cap full liquid ! this simple it tastes great . i don't anything negative say this product except it advertise 32 0z . bottle . my bottle 30 oz . size . but compared other places this best price source life . i tell difference energy level . it good product	1

i use this insurance policy keep my face getting oily , so i can't say exactly how well this works active acne , but chemically this seems equivalent anything else 2% salicylic acid . added twist it contains ' microbeads gently burst contact when massaged into skin ' . what this means it feels like you're rubbing your face soapy grit - which sounds bad , but it good thing . you feel little granules digging into your pores abrading dead skin even when you're just using your hands wash . so i prefer it neutrogena oil free acne wash reason . it also takes just tiny dab palm one hand lather up your face very well , so one tube lasts quite while , bottom dispensing tube very convenient . however , wide flat bottom design means when you no longer squeeze anything out there still quite bit left there . point you need take some scissors just cut top off you'll extra two weeks or so soap !	1

i bought 2 these pillow , one my husband one myself , back college . i would recommend this pillow anyone everyone . its amazing product works just described . we used ours every night over year never dissapointed . there few downsides noted other reviews , but nothing makes it bad product . negatives : core material get bunched up but it easily re-adjusted flattened out . if you vaccume seal it correctly it doesn't get bunched easily . very heavy slides around inside pillow case . requires weekly maintenance keep it good condition . but if you take care your chillow it take care you . positives : after well over year still worked like day we got it . never lost its cool so speak ! chillow my best friend while fighting migraine ! ( which 4 times week)i slept better than i ever my life . note i want point out common mis-conception noted some reviews . chillow get warmer night progresses , however it intentional . our body falls sleep faster cooler temperatures , but middle night when we rem sleep , cold make us restless disturb our sleep . chillow designed become warmer provide more restfull sleep during our critical rem sleep cycles . this very important part what chillow all ! great sleep ! after more than year , i want note both our chillows sprung leaks , thrown out . leaking wasn't enough soak our pillows , but water them so long it slight odor it wasn't pleasant sleep . i am here buying 2 more new chillows , they worth every penny . i am more than happy support soothsoft purchasing replacements great product made my hectic life more bareable !	1

i love these glasses . they always there when i need them ... hanging around my neck ready me put them place . only problem i experienced related application i am using them ... my shop . i got 3.00 so i could good close up look when necessary . however , i've noticed when i'm actively working around project getting myself different positions related object my work , glasses often separate where magnets positioned bridge glasses causing me clear both hands tools or whatever them reconnect lenses . it exasperating , but you've got able see your work . this design flaw product clearly doesn't apply most people situation . some might argue my head just too big ! while i may big ego , my head actually slightly smaller than average . this problem could likely corrected manufacturer extending each temple one inch give glasses more room expand before breaking apart . but important thing you know i'd still buy these glasses all over again . they really terrific	1

if you don't like getting attention , these not you . i'm often surprised people astonished reactions act putting them taking them off ; i'm so accustomed pulling them apart , i forget how unusual viewing public finds it . i wearing clics nearly year . i pretend i don't need glasses , but course i nearly decade . popped standard diopter lenses out , put my bifocal prescription . it worked great , despite warning my optical shop . ( even if they broken experiment , price right : i could try it again . ) previously i wearing glasses chain . besides various difficulties noted reviewer , i also found plastic loops connect chain arms glasses bad habit stretching . then glasses slip off chain inappropriate times frames break . i call color mine " magenta " - which may or may not same online " red " - i bought them shop (** gasp **) . my short hair not problem , but i agree reading bed doesn't work . so i use different pair those occasions	1

( salon waxing / lazor tx/ etc . / too expensive . ) finally : i acheived desired results ; legs silky smooth touch lay eyes , using braun epilator ( plucks hairs out root using 12 rotating " tweezers " ) followed conair hair removal system ( i call it polisher ) . braun epilator removes all hairs long enough tweezed , leaving behind ingrown hairs some micro-hairs , hairs too short tweezed . conair system uncovers all ingrown hairs , removes most hairs uncovered micro hairs . after using braun epilator , conair system , moisturizer , my legs feel silky smooth . smoothness lasts days , not hours . wonderful ! only downside : i use one polishing disk per leg , each time i exfoliate . i wish disks would last longer . bottom line ; my legs appear smoother feel silky longer than they w/ shaving , so overall , i'm delighted	1

just ordered , so i can't comment amazon shipping it , but i used it my miele front loading washer very successfully . one major caveat , though : i use * way * less detergent than scoop suggests - half lowest mark scoop plenty . more than suds remain . perhaps if you pets or kids who play mud lot you need higher amounts , but my " normal " wash sure doesn't warrant it fact seems work better lower amounts .

i admit it , i got this because it cheap ! i thick , wavy hair which needs straightend because i use very very good set ceramic straighteners , hair dryer didn't matter much . however , first time i used it i shocked how straight silky my hair felt ! combined straighteners my hair looks awesome ! i noticed some people commenting dryer cutting out after week or so . this happened me too i too thought it bust . however , i checked plug it one those needs tested before applicance works - you know little red button plug safety ? it not just cut out plug but one needs doing each time it took few minutes figure it out because england ( where i am ) we don't these much . all i now press white button before i plug it it works charm . three heat settings ioniser settings great - it really makes difference when ioniser - not gimick all i suspected ( like i said , i got it because it cheap ! ) . it well worth money great buy ! if you thick hair which hard keep tamed , this really helps before rest regime	1

we used this humidifier our baby room two months now . it great job quietly keep room humid . now because winter not really started east coast here yet . if heater not kick , room would feel cold due humidity . problem this product only knob control output , but seems lacking feedback loop . therefore if it comes thermostat , i would say it perfect . but considering price , i let it go . it pretty easy maintain compared other traditional warm mist ( mineral buildup heating device ) or cool mist ( filter change accompanied loud fan noise ) humidifiers . however , you shouldn't forget occasional cleanings mildew under cap , under tank , base	1

i previously tried waterpik other rain fall like showerhead waterpik cf-201 . it horrible , arm wouldn't hold its place one i recieved this horrible leaking problem probably due its largely plastic construction . low expectations waterpik brand , i stumbled upon this gem . jp-130 looked lot sturdier than their other model . upon recieving it , my initial impressions true , fantastic ! chromed metal gave it distinguishably elegant look no plastic showerhead give . swing arm actually , when adjusted properly actually stays where you want it ! spray pattern very soothing gentle stream . it doesn't pack lot pressurized punch like some other heads . but i wasn't looking . my only gripes if i point out any would need possible longer swing arm . 9 " arm more than suitable most people . but i'm 6'1 " it'd nice little more range . i definitely couldn't imagine deal shorter swing arm . next , it not really problem , but i hope waterpik eventually makes newer model even wider head . 60 nozzles pretty good job covering my entire body if i stand still , but moving around little puts parts my body out stream . extra 1 " or 2 " would nice , extra 3-4 " diameter would superb ! regardless other reviews , i didn't find adjusting knobs hard other reviewers made it out , maybe it just me ? after reading what others said , i expected give each knob my " death grip , " but they didn't need it . overall , you simply can't beat this showerhead money . i'm sure it even better than more expensive showerheads . something people use multiple times day , 7 days week , it money well spent !!	1

i've using sumo tech years , far i'm concerned it best sculpting product out there . great creating shape texture - it light enough my fine , thin , straight hair . it doesn't greasy shine comes most pomades , but you mix little bb brilliantine or styling wax if you want little more gloss . little bit sumo tech goes long way - just put little water your hand if it dries out while styling instead using more . you also touch up your hairstyle during day using damp fingertips	1

i so sick shaving . irritation shaving cream , dry skin , rashes . this product revolution you get close shaving feel without hassles . must buy everyone who shaves	1
i spend alot money getting brazilian waxes . last couple times i must got timing all wrong because within week hair started sprouting up . i can't tell you how annoying , so i decided purchase emjoi epilator . i say this thing fabulous ! since i am used waxing " danger zone " me there no pain . fact it more comfortable than waxed . i also used it my legs , upper lip underarms . it great job everywhere . i highly recommend this product your hair removal needs , it paid itself one use . money i save i buy shoes	1
this second epilator i've owned it doesn't hurt/sting much when it used prior model . i couple places it scraped skin , so you somewhat careful use it properly . all all i'm very happy it	1
it crazy how people come up this stuff . these tooth tunes tooth brushes really facinating actually . song plays your mouth whole 2 minutes so you're brushing your teeth dentist suggested time . parents love it too , if you don't want sit watch your children brush their teeth , but make sure they're brushing them long enough , get them this ! they choose bunch different songs artists . it'll music your ears , teeth !	1
i don't drink often so when i it hard know my limits . this thing really helps . however i found you really wait while after your last drink before it get good reading . once i blew . 04 then 5 minutes later i blew . 09 !! i trust this thing works though . it warn you you should wait 20 minutes after your last drink . i would wait longer though . it worth money me . you should send it calibrated every 6 months though	1
you've probably bought these your local supermarket , so you know what you're getting -an alternative unhealthy snacks . i eat them tasty meal replacement bar , too . cost savings significant buying them through amazon . once we run through box i brought work , i'll buy again .	1
i think this one my favorite razor blades because it gets close enough your skin where it actually shaves . i also think it doesn't cut me often either	1
i can't around any kind perfume , cologne or other smells without breaking out into some sort rash or allergic reaction . if you allergic soaps other chemicals , this product still leave your clothes feeling soft without all strong smells	1
i considering replacing my mattress , but i thought i'd give this product try first . it very simple use i instant results . i've actually overinflated it bit when i sleep my stomach my back nearly flat . no more back problems ! i wake up feeling good change . i'm so happy i bought this , i've recommended it quite few people . give it try before getting new mattress	1
product perfect use daily cleanser or intensive mask . i've used it month my face neat oil free . although , i recommend not exceed 3-4 mins when using mask , since i experienced excessive drying afterwards .	1
i love this shaver -- finally there decent women shaver !. cleaning system works well . only drawback difficulty finding replacement cleaning solution -- i just pay $8 ship stuff ! i think i'll formulating my own next time	1
it apparent upon immediate receipt this pillow not typical king-sized pillow only two inches larger than standard memory foam contour pillow i already own . noted other comment , odor extremely strong . though i not owned this pillow very long , i made numerous attempts " air out " this pillow , odor remains very strong . addition , this firmest memory foam pillow i ever experienced . i'm hoping time it soften , because it certainly not used sleeping its current state .	-1

... until motor went out one i using 2 years . i thought ' ionic ' thing mostly hype , but started using this product couple years ago out curiosity . my entire life , i naturally curly , flyaway hair annoyingly prone frizzing just generally difficult manage . i wasn't sure if it this dryer finally started smoothing out my hair , or if it rather newer conditioners styling cremes i found . when ionic brush dryer i using recently ' died ' , i unable find replacement any local stores . so , instead , i bought one looked exactly same wasn't ionic , thinking it really wouldn't make any difference . boy , i wrong !!! immediately , i again dealing split ends , frizzies , flyaway hair . there something ' ionic ' hairdryers really make difference , i changed nothing else . scientific person i am , i repeated this unplanned ' experiment ' least 3 times . when i use this product , my hair noticeably silkier , shinier , bouncier ... healthy waves hold ( i somewhat thick hair . ) round brush/dryer style also dries my hair much quicker than way i used it years ( round brushes typical pistol-style dryers ) , much less arm-fatigue . heated air dries it ' inside out ' which styles it same time , eliminating my previous need use curling iron or hot rollers create soft waves/curls after drying . i plan keep spare one hand next time one dies me suddenly . ( i feel like 2 years good life , considering use it got . ) i highly recommend this hair dryer if you hair like mine	1

my advice , get this scale . it dead accurate , last you forever . it exact same scale doctors use , very good price . i never buy any electronic scale again	1
this excellent product . packaging very good . it came two pieces . assembly minimum , but slightly cumbersome because weight . scale accurate it looks like it made last . reason i gave it only 4 stars height measurement rod felt toocheap breakable . lastly , it should understood this scale not everybody . it either doctor office or large bath or exercise room . i not able find anything comparable value less price .	1
i looking scale gave consistent weights 25 years . i tried healthometer spring scales numerous digital scales supposed weigh you within . 2 pound . hah . i would step scale 4 or 5 times consecutively get 4 or 5 different weights . now i am confident i am weighed within . 25 pouund every time . assembly snap it looks like scale built well enough pass my grand children . if you looking truly accurate scale built like tank buy 402kl your worries over . unfortunately bowl ben jerry show up immediately morning weigh	1

chocoleans work suppress actual hunger ; however , they nothing " i feel like eating " feeling . i use them suppress hunger , then when i still feel like eating , i know it not real hunger but my usual food fixations . it helps me psychologically anyway , interpret my feeding feelings ! also , they work best if you not eat one hour before after taking . ( drinks don't count , doesn't seem affect anything . ) i love taste , can't tell much difference sugar-free regular ones ... sugar-free only 6 calories less . it very dark chocolate , so if you don't like dark you probably won't care	1

amazon not provide additional responses feedback responses so my only recourse refuting this company false claims through product review . i wrote negative feedback january 25 . i notice this company responds very aggressively all negative feedback . they said my feedback it " blatantly untrue " because i said they not permit returns . here their own published statement amazon site regarding returns certain products : * pillows , orthopedic soft goods , supports , braces other non-returnable health care items . maintain our deeply discounted pricing your safety protection , regional health laws hygienic concerns render us unable accept returns all pillows , orthopedic soft goods , braces , supports , hot/cold therapy items , electrodes or any other item comes contact skin once it evident it opened removed its original packing . we accept returns unopened products . now i ask : how could one ever determine usability product like this without opening it ?!! absurd . this company needs seriously review its tone attitude towards its customers . what i wrote true their own statement proves it . furthermore , i left my feedback january 25 they said i " bought this almost two months ago " when fact i ordered it december 16 received it after . they not truthful public posted opposition factual feedback statement . their rude , dishonest aggressive response says all needs said their customer service ! i not like product all , but i really dislike their customer service .	-1

i extremely thick , coarse , very wavy ( almost curly ) hair -- definitely challenge any flat iron . prior this curling/straightening iron , i owned $150 we t-t o-dry t3 tourmaline flat iron ( see my review ) , $50 jilbere flat iron , run-of-the-mill drugstore curling iron . conair good job straightening smoothing my hair t3 or jilbere . once i flat iron it , it stays so nice smooth next day it doesn't even require minor touch up . i actually like conair better , because no matter how careful i , t3 terrible pulling my hair , jilbere , while better , still caught stray hair now then . i never gotten hair snagged conair . i love one less hair appliance/cord one less cord cluttering my counter . i also really like it auto turn off forgetful people like me . it slightly more wieldy than flat iron or curling iron alone , but that almost always case when you get 2-in-1 anything . i think it mainly due account rounded outer shape when straightening . you hold it little farther away your scalp . i can't think how they could've made it easier , though , while still keeping 2-in-1 design . it easy switch back forth curling iron straightener . power light temp control right front , so i tell glance whether it or not . other flat irons , i look plates see light . one small nitpick i wish i could set temp it would default same temp everytime i turn it . it , i turn it up every time . but conair amazing bargain . less than $30 convenience curling iron / straightener one , i am highly impressed . i would happily buy it again twice cost , would not hesitate recommend it anyone .	1
this hands down best hair straightener i've ever used ... extremely curly frizz-prone hair , i've quite few over years . i've using it every other day past several weeks so far seen no damage all my hair . fact , it feels even healthier silkier than before . it doesn't sear my hair all , which problem previous straighteners used . it heats up quickly incredibly easy use . shipping quick hai stik works great ! definitely worth money	1

i've mine several years now i find it very dependable useful . i initially some startup problems i , too , thought might battery or switch related . however i discovered spritz wd40 into cutter blades made this tool very dependable . all hair-cutting clippers shavers , blade lubrication needed . other thing people should know while blades cut rotary direction , only way hairs get into cutter through slots . so this tool cuts way only , so just putting it area leaving it there ineffective ... you insert reinsert get uncut hairs into slots . knowing these two things should give you good experience this tool . " pulling " " tickling " others report also minimized blades lubricated so they cut cleanly rather than jam	1

you need follow instructions before turning this ... including putting cardboard collar before inserting wax . wax pernicious ... it gets everything ... so warned . i've gotten my eyebrows waxed strip mall salon before few times . last session someone i've never it before - results showed she likely hadn't doing it long . $10 pop plus tip , i finally realized i should doing this myself - no more shelling out money language barrier how i want it , etc . it take while wax sufficiently warm up - 30 minutes . instructions lackluster - so they lose star just . i would say 99% instructions legal jargon keep them sued ... like don't use this your privates , etc . pulllease ! no insider tips - they assume you've graduated beauty school don't bother tell you much all . thanks wikipedia , i learned lot waxing felt better using this gizmo . i successfully waxed my armpits - this took 3 separate sessions . i would never salon . i'm one those unfortunate women bumpy armpit skin ... so hairs go every direction shaving means i get cut every single time i shave . one day , when i afford it , i get laser hair removal , but mean time , it pretty easy waxing home armpits , eyebrows sideburns . i've struggled legs .. so much surface area ... you're only supposed apply wax once skin per session , so i like my skin few days off before attempting again , otherwise skin peels . other kits i looked didn't look easy operate , which why i chose this warmer . while it bit scam all their wax cans fit only this warmer , no other brand seems structured fit . so far , i am pleased results- wax really grabs hair when yanking bunch same time , there hardly any discomfort ... nothing like pain monotony plucking each hair tweezers	1

nice fragrance i suppose , major problem it it seems stick whatever you spray it months ( clothing wise furniture wise ) . extremely pungent but not sharp all , again it seems rather persistent smell , characteristic i'm not too fond . within last couple years ralph lauren changed their marketing strategy it seems though they going younger audiences , laid back type , high school young college students opposed adults ... this fragrance no different , fact given price it seems following line thought " . " i'm actually quite surprised this product hasn't come down price recently construction quality undoubtedly make you think it isn't high end fragrance . there no wearing this formal affairs , instead it made everyday use ... some like it , i one got sick it fast ( probably something " persistent " or " pungent " characteristic , this coupled fact polo sport mellow not sharp ) . comparing them i'd say dunhill desire far superior product : both extremely mellow yet i feel dunhill fruitier more complex price , while polo sport more chemical ( man made)-meets-lavender shocking sort way . i suppose again , price this easily overlooked but me i'm not entirely sure i like it much i my youth . if you enjoy " mellow " everyday wear don't mind rather " persistent " characteristic this fragrance , than all means give it try - it sure popular late , more than few people daily outing know what you're wearing ( adults might think , `something cheap ' while younger individuals might find it appealing ) . all reasons i previously mentioned though , i'm going give this 2	-1

i now own three ( two spares ) , purchased few friends well . this headlamp three light settings : red led ( which i use most : great behavioral observations nocturnal animals , preserving your night vision ) , white led , bright krypton bulb . it runs three aaa batteries ( nimh rechargeables work fine ! ) . i've used my headlamp months field work ( i study scorpions , work all night , so this headlamp gotten lot field testing ) . no problems so far . it comparable headlamps sporting goods stores sell four or five times much . while likely not waterproof , this headlamp definitely water-resistant ( ok use rain ) . i love it , may never need headlamp again . though amazon currently sells them " pack 2 " , they packaged individually , each one comes 3 alkaline batteries	1
i very highly pleased these lights when i received them .. leds great long use things like camping fishing spotlight great when you need real bright light anything . i would highly recommend this light anyone	1
you're probably struggling choose clipper because reviews so mixed . my experience anyway . i bought wahl super taper ii mostly because 5-star review " inquisitivetoo " . i couldn't happier this clipper so far . i've cut my son hair once , my hair twice . this clipper truly cut hair like knife through butter . aside excellent blades , overall design impressive . this clipper hefty , delivering substantial hand-feel . different-colored clip-on combs easily selected color , eliminating need read print each one . only negative taper ii not cordless . attached cord quite long however , allowing good mobility your wall outlet wherever you're cutting . i see this clipper offered through multiple vendors here , wide range price points which confusing . i can't see any difference plastic-sealed versions , bought one priced $55.95 ( this date ) sold through hairproducts-com	1

( that unusual me - i'm normally bored product much sooner than ! ) lotion little thick , but goes smoothly ; nice , light scent ; absorbs quickly so i get my other makeup . if i one " wish " item this product , it would pump wouldn't clog quite so easily daily uses ; but that small concern compared how great my skin looks . i'm really pleased this lotion	1

since i bought shower filter save my hair dried out ( it worked wonders , my hair never shinier)and i very hard water - i began worry bathing unfiltered water faucet . i chose this bath water filter because instead hanging over faucet you simply drop it into tub five minutes before getting . this way , water pressure stays strong enough so my bubble bath really bubbles . this filter not refillable since i just trying them out - i didn't want spend extra money refillable one . but i probably go refillable version now since my skin definitely feels softer .	1
i issue mine , it shorted out or something . just got bad one . i going call it replaced , but new baby , just not time . when i posted my review , they contacted me offered replace it ! talk going above beyond . day such poor customer service , this wonderful ! looking forward my new one , it ingenious product , make " testing " water bit easier , when alone giving baby bath	1
i love this product -- it makes it easy see what temperature takes some stress out bathtime . it also unobtrusive so you still use bathtub shower normally . my husband skeptical it , but then he used it . when i took it off , he said he needed it give our 4 month old bath . i'm looking forward trying out infant tub	1
these glasses always attract attention ( mostly when i'm not wearing them ! ) people always amazed when they see me click my readers into place . lenses hang molded lucite-type back strap ( this part inflexible ) , they pivot so they point downward when not worn . put them , just pivot lenses 90 degree angle , lift them your eyes , voila , strong magnet center joins two lenses nose bridge . side pieces adjust retractable extension encased lucite . i've lost so many pairs readers , but these always right there around your neck , not getting left behind coffeeshop counter ! they not all compact , however , because mentioned before , backstrap molded piece . neck/back strap also makes them little hard wear while reading bed , so i put them after getting settled , seems work just fine . finally , even though they not most fashion-forward version eyewear , their convenience fun clicking them into place makes up their clunky looks .	1

i am 35 year power user electric shavers , many years those remington microscreen shavers . my very first original microscreen excellent shaver , but ni-cad batteries it died not readily replaceable . i several rotary shavers which never really worked well me . so i bought new microscreen which worked well me many years until batteries it also died . this shaver almost good these past shavers , but much less expensive . some disadvantages : screen not replaceable . but most other shavers , replacement screen costs more than this whole shaver . i use same aa rechargeable batteries it i use my digital camera , so batteries never going make whole shaver unuseable . it shave little slower than normal one . but backup shaver , travel , use car , etc , you find it hard beat	1
cuts close smooth . it 5 months now it still works great . would totally recommend it	1
i've never used anything but electric razor , while general i've happy their performance , i less than enamored last few shavers i've owned . my last one , basic braun model , left me oh-so-'80s miami vice look ; one before , norelco , literally fell apart my hands ( rotary heads fell out while i cleaning them , gently , brush provided manufacturer ) . those recent experiences make me doubly ecstatic remington r-960 titanium rotary shaver i got month ago amazon . shave closest i've ever received , shaver itself easy both clean recharge , going more than dozen shaves without needing recharge . ( spirit full disclosure , however , i must admit my beard only moderately heavy . ) some complained trimmer blade too broad , but it suits my sideburns just fine . particularly discount amazon offers , remington r-960 excellent , excellent buy	1

i think half reviews i've read ridiculous . read darn instruction manual . when it your 10% goal weight pops up , use user buttons go up down set it your actual goal weight . don't review item badly when you too stupid read directions correctly !!	1
i recently bought this scale , i think it great investment ! weight it accurate , it allows you both set weight goal , track it you're losing . reviewers who complained you can't set your own weight goal , you . when you set up your user number , it automatically gives you goal weight ( 10%) . per instruction booklet , you then use p1 p2 buttons raise lower number . great feature center balance . if you step scale aren't centered , weight change greatly . this scale , before your weight pops up , there lines going across it . side lines pointing side too much weight it . if you see small dot center , then you're standing it correctly , your weight accurate . course , other than user settings , it still average scale , someone who interested just getting their weight . i definitely think it worth-while .	1
i impressed this scale ! it easy use , easy read ! very happy this purchase .	1
i read this product parenting magazine decided give it try . after first use itself , i saw wonderful results . skin feels so soft supple it seems like those blemishes hidden . i use it every week i recommend it anyone who not time go out those one hour facials every other week but manage spend few minutes shower using this produc t.t he only reason i gave it 4 stars not 5 starts because i observed you very gently rub product into your skin if you not very gentle , you might end up red spots or burnt skin . this happened couple times but now i am very careful very gentle whil rubbing this product into my skin . i still highly recommend it	1

ibuprofen good over counter analgesic ( pain reliever ) works mild moderate pain . ibuprofen generic drug name , active ingredient advil motrin . it comes 200 milligam tablets/capsules . most mild aches , it quite effective . not only ibuprofen relieve pain , but it also real good anti-inflammatory medication ( it lessens swelling ) . thus it also good arthritis pain , any joint or muscle sprains or strains , real good toothache pain too . if two tablets taken , it equivalent previously prescription only product , " motrin " . two tablets , or 400 mg ibuprofen mild moderate pain . three tablets , 600 mg , moderate moderately severe pain . all three doses , 200 , 400 , 600 mg taken every 4 hours needed pain . four tablets highest prescribed dose ( 800 mg ) , should only taken once every 6 hours . reserve four tablet dosaging your really severe pain . 800mg dose equivalent tylenol #3 ( anetaminophen codiene ) , good pain reliever . how you purchase ibuprofen up you , but there some real good generic ibuprofen products less than half cost " name brand " products ( advil , motrin ) . both generic name brand equal terms strength effectiveness . only thing different name brand fancier packaging perhaps easier swallow dose forms . i buy my ibuprofen generic form ; not only i get it cheaper , i get more tablets too . jim " konedog " koenig	1

here what you want good nights sleep ! and/or if you mattress " butt holes " it , you put this topper over it you new mattress ! if needed you get large piece plywood this topper your mattress ! if you like it soft , then this may not you i find it bit firm , not hard , but firm . all homedics memory foam coolcore products , they " odor " ( clean one ) fades time . however one topper last bit longer than pillows unless you pull covers back during daytime keep window open . note it not bad offenside odor , but distinct one . keep mind , it comes big box heavy ( 41 pounds it says ) . so lookout delivery !!! price saves fifty bucks over others ! plus free shipping ! those who famuliar memory foam know how it heats up after you're it while ! but not homedics coolcore keeps it cool ( not cold , but cool ) . add this topper homedics pillow ( see my previous items ) you great nights sleep ! only negative it comes all rolled up , you lay it get " bumps " out after you unroll it it takes few hours ( don't expect lay it right away all smooth ) . they great job packaging it shrink plastic so you know it factory fresh , there bunch moisture eater packets inside , then it inside nifty white drawstring bag ( reusable) !! i must admit , price ( go mattress store see price higher end memory foam coolcore ) it really great !	1

this great product - it actually kind fun . i thought getting it because our friend one he passes around parties . it neat people see how high their blood alcohol content , if it what they expect it . my only complaint this product not meant used often . second time we " played " it ( home ) , readings seemed off . i then read product information if you use product frequently , it may need recalibrated every month or so . recalibration involves mailing it off paying $20 . now we know , we'll keep it our pocket use it when we truly concerns - not passing it around everyone use . but i love they sell these public use , it truly important safety tool modern times	1
i'm pretty happy this digital scale . it ready use out box , without any calibration needed . scale comes two small lithium batteries ( same kind used watches ) power scale itself . you pop 9v battery ( not included ) talking part . just step scale your weight appear lcd quickly . lcd easy read when there light . because it not backlit , so you won't able see your weight when lighting inadequate . scale fairly accurate . all digital scales , it never gives you exactly same reading if you step off step again . but variation acceptable . scale long warranty so case you think it not working , just send it warranty repairs . ( but honest , i think it'll cheaper just buy new one than paying postage . ) talking part not very exciting . english voice , faux female , quite annoying . i think it pretty easy understand , but voice too robotic . actually it also sounds like dog barking . short , this cheap digital scale pretty good	1

i am enjoying my new remington hair dryer ! it good choice , i believe . i especially like long power cord . it also very good not get tangled . my only complaint , if you want call it , i expected hair dryer would quieter than it . i checked around before i purchased it , one selling points it supposed operate more quiet than your average hair dryer , but i can't really hear much difference , if any . regardless , i am enjoying it	1
product great . we twins they don't stay still more than 5 seconds , impossible measure their temperature thermometers need more than 1 minute results . we already bought 3 these 1 didn't work very well . 2 them , batteries came very low , necessary change very soon . i recommend this ear thermomether though	1
i thick , wavy hair falls below my shoulders . it layered , shortest layer my chin . i also few fringes fall eye level . this flat iron better than 2 " conair i years finally died . i would agree it seems wider iron would work faster but it really doesn't , nor it work ay better . fact i think this one works better than wider one . it doesn't dry my hair out much ( if you think how much time your hair spends exposed heat each width plate , it makes sense ) i also find it easier make flips 1 " . it gets short pieces just nicely longer pieces . it heats up quickly i just fine 15 . comb attachment waste time my opinion , mostly due its tangling capabilities . i love it lock it it very light ; makes it great traveling . i hope this helps	1
i purchased this gift my niece who expecting . she seemed very pleased it . it part her gift registry said it exactly what she needed . i am happy this purchase	1
i using nature gate organics acne treatment system just under year now absolutely love results . i using kit uses benzoyl peroxide its main acne-fighting ingredient , but it really dried my skin out bleaching action peroxide ruined countless towels t-shirt necklines . so when friend recommended nature gate organics acne kit , i thought i'd give it try . after first kit , i've never even considered using anything else . i find salicylic acid based formula gentler my skin but still very effective clearing up breakouts preventing new ones . i've used salicylic acid products past without greatest results , but however nature gate organics acne product formulated , it works . ( according their packaging , it combination oligopeptide-10 makes salicylic acid more effective . ) it really important stick complete regimen , though . when i first started using kit , i used three products haphazardly , using cleanser one day but not toner lotion , etc . i could tell difference , though , when i followed package directions used all three . cleanser , toner lotion each their function i'm really happy how my skin feels looks when i use whole system . i've gotten lot compliments how good my skin looks , too , since i started using nature gate organics . this also first formula i've found didn't dry out my skin . i think most acne products formulated teens really oily skin . those us past puberty ( i'm 30+) but still dealing adult acne , we need products effective but gentle . fact it contains natural/organic ingredients added bonus . all those botanicals makes it smell great , too ! me , nature gate organics acne treatment perfect . i don't write lot reviews , but i felt compelled when i saw it posted here because i really believe this product . plus , i'm so glad amazon offering it such good price	1
this trimmer very nice job . i've used it wet dry environments without issue . i've even rinsed it under running water while it without any problems . so it fits bill wet/dry . only issue i opinion thing . lowest setting trim guard isn't close enough too close without trim guard . ( not sure proper name so i'm calling removable blade guard , which also acts trim gage , " trim guard " . ) i am very happy ease attachment removal trim guard . also height adjustment trim guard on/off very easy both wet dry environments . ease use wet/dry , i would give this item 5 . but overall close but not quite 5 star because 0 setting ( no trim guard ) close enough cut skin easily . if i wanted trim hair close i would just use razor shave	1
i got one @ walmart $9 . it simple sturdy like jazzfan says , it great reading if your woman sleeping . it also my default flashlight . i dropped it more times than i remember it still works .	1
i love this massager . when beginning use there bit discomfort but normal any deep massage . after first minute massagers adjusts size your leg pressure needs . i think it old saying " it hurts soooo good " . while using i didn't feel relaxation comes traditional massage , but later even next day benifiest clear convincing . i didn't leg cramps or tension while falling asleep i felt more energetic next day . if it less expensive i would give it 5 stars . amazon price excellent but since many could really use this machine limited income it shame price prevent many buying it .	1
this product wonderful . i bought three , one myself others my sisters . it smells delicious leaves my skin feeling clean . i highly recommend it	1
i bought this product my sister . she living small apt abt 400sqf w/4 cats 1 dog . it like zoo ! air not good everyone tell . i end up running noise everytime i stop . she suffers gerd nasal polyp . she seeing otolaryngologist tried chinese medicine acupuncture . nothing really helping . i heard people living animals same symptoms . unfortunately , she would not give up her pets even if she dies some sort fatal illness . so i thought air-purifier would help , least clean air her apt . i shopping around until i found this which best reviews . she using this product month , she coughs lot less than b4 feel air lot fresher . i definately recommend this product someone who pets don't want give them up .	1
i experiencing severe allergy symptoms so i researched air purifiers web while this one seemed best match me . it awesome . low setting , there no detectable sound but you walk up it feel air flowing so you know it working . i mainly use it one room it keeps room comfortable me . it 2 ft tall but not heavy easy move other rooms if needed . i not it long enough clean filters but when i installed filters initially , instructions easy follow installation very easy . i would recommend this product would purchase it again if i needed one	1
i using this cleanser over 15 years it still best , gentle , never harsh , non-drying . i admit this not everybody , i blessed enough genetics(my maternal grandmother ) not acne problems , but people normal oily skin , not get breakouts ; this one best cleansers use	1
if you sensitive skin this great product . i use it twice day , every day . it great morning get nice clean " canvass " upon which apply your makeup . it also nice job removing makeup evening . i love way this product cleans my face without leaving it feeling tight too dry they way some products . i naturally oily skin this product removes surface oil makeup leaves my skin feeling natural yet clean . this product little , no scent . entire cetaphil line this product designed sensitive skin non-comedogenic . i would recommend this product anyone wants clean their skin without removing all protective oils their skin . my dermatologist recommended this years ago , i am still happy consumer product	1
works like charm . so much easier clean than larger ones	1
i purchased several crane humidifiers thrown several them away : crane , two apples . i 2 elephants wouldn't buy any other models . elephants put out maximum amount humidity least amount problems . only problem i they leak under snout small extent . they easy clean we run them 24 hours day when we home . i would recommend them , but realize there some leaking you need put towel front them . i would buy additional elephants if needed .	1
this trimmer doesn't adjustable trim lever like i'm used , but it gets job	1
i bought different brand previously it horrible . it so loud neighor my apartment building actually thought fire alarm going off . convinced me it time try different razor . i got this because price only used it couple times , but i think it works great . based my experience it blows away competition . if you aren't happy it , it only cost one haircut .	1
when i plugged this model , i couldn't believe how quiet it compared previous model we owned . it worked great 2 weeks , then stopped collecting water . we followed all troubleshooting steps manual , but it still would not work . i very disappointed out $26 we spent shipping ..	-1
i like these wipes because they un-scented . also travel pack comes resealable top so you don't need seperate hard-sided container	1
i purchased this remington use travel shaver remington , model r-890 , several years , still use . i am well satisfied new model 845 tho ' i not use it much ; it use same shaving rotors head 890 . only drawback i find it cannot operate directly off power/recharging cord ; it only recharged run only off battery . 890 used either mode . but then , 845 comes more economical price than 890 . overall i find remington good shaver no inclination try or switch any other make	1
i wish i paid more attention details before choosing this shaver . i paid $5 more than non-rechargeable wish i just gotten cheaper one . this particular model only works battery . if battery dies , it not plugged used . you wait it charge . other than , it nice job	1
okay , i bought this item walmart while ago . this product nothing treat/prevent acne further breakout . i know it cheap one , but also it doesn't work all ... i'd say try either proactiv or klear action . if those don't work then you'd seriously see doctor/surgeon laser treatment permanently get rid acne acne scars	-1
i've using eucerin few years am definitely sticking it . it fragrance-free perfect sensitive skin ( acne-prone skin , too ) . feel very lightweight , but coverage excellent . unlike other moisturizers ( like some neutrogena or oil olay ) , i never apply second layer combat dryness . it worth price . i use it under make-up well .	1
this one simpliest , fastest , most compact roller set i've ever used . it limited 5 large 5 medium ionic rollers ; easy set , easy heat , easy remove . results soft , non-frizzy , wavy hair keeps all day . i used almost daily great results . its tiny footprint allows this set go easily travel .	1

i tried many " non-oily " sunscreens use my face , but i am always left heavy feeling my skin sunscreen smell . i recently bought this one my grocery store use vacation arizona california . i pleasantly surprised this product- it doesn't feel oily or heavy when applied once dry feels though i am not wearing sunscreen my face . i spent two weeks out west plenty sun time never burned . i would highly recommend this sunscreen anyone who hates sunscreen feeling their face , but doesn't want premature aging or skin cancer ! excellent product	1
make long story short , i can't even think shaving daily blades because irritation . i also own 5-year-old high-end norelco rotary ( like it quite bit ) , but i only get close shave it while shaving ( wet ) every 3-4 days , i shave it ( dry ) daily only minor irritation , but not close shave ... not close all ! after researching insatiably , i decided try foil electric ( panasonic or braun ) because almost every review i read said it provides less irritation closer shave than rotary , it better shorter hairs , making it ideal daily shaving . my plan buy braun , use it 30 days , return it then give panasonic try next 30 days , then choose one i liked most . let me put it this way , i know it takes skin 2-4 weeks get used new shaving system ; i owned braun total three days ( that right , 3 shaves ) i honestly tell you i not returning it , not even thinking trying out panasonic . this best shave i ever my life , period ! first shave wasn't close i expecting , but after running it through cleaning system , next two shaves spectacular ... close , smooth not one bit irritation ! oh , don't pay attention those who complain cleaning station loud ... i can't even hear damn thing while shower running , it only makes noise 5 minutes , after it all quiet ... plus it this really cool blue light gives my sink counter very high tech look	1
i agree previous review , they very high quality vitamins but very difficult swallow . i grind them coffee bean blender then add them whey protien shake , seems works very well	1
... so all people who follow me around asking , " what wonderful fragrance you ?

obviously strange comparison teases mind further explanation . may i suggest test drive encompass all aspects thorough trial . first , equipment : exceptionally well engineered intended purpose . sleek design beckons , try me , hands-on approach . well placed highly responsive controls cover all requirements . all seasons wet or dry duty kind animal respected heritage . floating heads firm or soft ride really make difference where linear activated blades meet whiskers . course real issue resultant tribute supremely close comfortable shave . my last experience electric shavers ended my lust one during 1950 . baskets used blades mountains lather my constant companions until recently which point i dared explore mans ' progression species . you believe ? technology , innovation , divine inspiration , dare achieve . there hope yet our survival i base my conclusion solely benefits able finally enjoy without hassel or fear " joy shaving " . system works best me soften my whiskers warm water soap , rinse , then apply 50/50 mix shaving gel penetrating lotion . i call this my 98% shave ( compared blade shave ) . without hesitation i say this my favorite , if not best , purchase amazon . perhaps this simple evaluation but none less one passed all tests ease .	1
recommended " so you'd like start wearing cologne " guide amazon ( which i bought reviewed them all ) this cologne almost perfect male fragrance . term comes mind this case " eq " . it just perfect range scents very well balanced bass , mids , high notes . it not too citrusy like many other colognes i happen like , it more serious definitively male . comparatively it more serious version tommy , more sex-scent oriented than hugo , broad spicy mid-range . it doesn't over-amount top notes never make it your skin , this cologne dependable smell like it when you put it hours later .	1

because family history skin cancer ( non-fatal , fortunately ) , i must wear sunblock my face all time , even just walking outside nyc . since i usually apply sunblock just after shaving , choice product very important . my dermatologist suggested i might try this neutrogena sunblock . it very high spf blocks uv rays , seems dry up entirely without any evidence it ever there . apparently they added ultra-fine silica powder which contains greasy look feel . any case , i liked it it seems work very well . unscented , which good me too	1
while most sunscreens these days protect against sunburn , you know very few them actually protect against photodamage ? photodamage damage sun your skin symptoms which brown spots , wrinkles such . only two sunscreen ingredients protect against long uvai rays cause photodamage ; zinc oxide parsol 1789 . zinc oxide protects broader range these rays than parsol 1789 . this sunscreen parsol 1789 ( avobenzone ) . it good , certainly offers more photo damage protection than most , but sunscreen zinc oxide would better still . zinc oxide also less irritating , it even found some baby care products . because parsol 1789 chemical rather than physical sunscreen like zinc oxide , some may experience irritation neutrogena dry touch . this neutrogena goes very smooth dry you can't even tell you wearing suncscreen . this very nice , although it bit scent which i don't like ( i would prefer it non scented , i don't like smelling like soap-neutrogena , you listening ? ) . all all , money this good sunscreen either your face or your body it particularly good oily skin it make your skin seem less oily . but if you willing spend bit more money , check out zinc oxide sunscreen such skinceuticals ultimate 30 which offers bit more protection less irritating ( zinc oxide less irritating parsol 1789 ) . most certainly least get sunscreen parsol 1789 such this one	1
this basic unit lot like one gramma used , but it safe reliable not expensive some i've seen ( offer no more features additional cost ) .	1

my parents bought me electric razor christmas , my first . god-awful razor actually good learning experience , because it taught me few select things : 1 . i hard time keeping daily shaving routine . i'm always liable skip day . 2 . wet/dry shaving electric actually better than using blade . 3 . nicd batteries , their 8-hour recharge time , huge annoyance . schick ( didn't know they made electric razors , you ? ) i couldn't shave my growth if i skipped day , my facial hair doesn't even grow all fast . addition , order properly charge shaver , i supposed completely discharge shaver , then recharge ( presumably avoid memory effect nicd batteries ) . ultimately , this meant one or two shaves out week ended halfway through process . i went back using blades while . but some unknown force compelled me peruse electric shaver section fry one day . after comparing boxes , i settled this one $ ... it honestly more than i wanted spend , but i figured i could return it if it didn't measure up . first shave panasonic proved me whole " 30-day acclimation period " crap . this thing worked immediately , fresh out box , better than my old shaver ever could . dry . wet shaving , while more involved , shaves much closer while not causing much irritation . battery meter nice feature , but kicker fast recharge time . even if shaver dies , 5-10 minutes all i need it running again . i also don't worry " memory effect " ni-mh batteries . integrated trimmer foils actually works , means i actually shave every-other-day it still its job well . cleaning involves running it under faucet bit hand soap . all this said , there some caveats . hairs my neck still somewhat pesky , won't go away without fight . i experiment find best direction come them panasonic . i'm sure more expensive shavers might easier time them . also , this thing really should come some sort stand . it comes cloth bag traveling , but no stand . get rid nose-hair trimmer ( which i no use ) just give me basic stand so i place set shaver dry . while i could spent less shaver similar features , i'd hard pressed find one this price everything well , without any major annoyances . it wet-dry , charges fast shaves well . only thing i'm not looking forward buying replacement blades , but if it continues work like it past 6 months , i can't really complain .	1
bathroom scales what i expected , i no problems them	1

i lot trouble dry air hotels when i travel , especially during winter mountains . this good humidifier easily fits into carry bag . biggest problem i it it doesn't quite last night sleep . so what i right after checking , i would turn humidifier high . go out , eat dinner , etc . then just before going sleep , i would refill it set it low . even though it would run out , humidity would comfortable level . so i sleep restfully . notes : it get area around it wet , so you may want set it towel ( plenty extra hotels ) . depending water quality , it leave mineral-like deposits . so you may need clean it after each use ( or maybe use filtered water ) .	1

i'm waiting book come out called " 101 ways use magic erasers " because i'll bet there 101 ways least . these sponges pick upi dirt you didn't even know there . let me tell you some ways i put them use : 1 . used it kitchen walls/ceiling remove dirt/grease film - looks like new . ( not recommend using flat finish or cheaper paints though without checking area first ) . 2 . used it quickly remove soap scum shower/tub without use chemicals . 3 . used it remove car wax black plastic portions my car ( don't you hate it when you get wax there you can't get it off ? )4 . used it my kitchen counter remove wine stain . 5 . used it get gumminess off things i purchased those annoying gummy labels them . i am still finding uses these . they recommend not using them wood i agree . i tested it it remove finish . however if you planning refinish your natural wood ( not painted ) kitchen cabinets something like rejuvenate cabinet restorer ( also great product ) then i recommend cleaning them magic eraser first improve adherence ( worked me , but test it first inside cabinet door make sure you see good results too ) . note - this not like your typical sponge not replace typical sponge ... but instead remove dirt where traditional psonge can't . magic erasers disintigrate you use them so they not last long traditional sponge . bj club used sell their own brand magic eraser ( less $) , but i not seen them there awhile .	1

first shave seemed good ; but second time me fusion . instead just one nick , i managed around 3 or 4 nicks once . but looking cost replacement cartridges put me into state price shock . i got merkur heavy duty double edge safety razor blades huge savings . merkur blades or feather double edge blades average 50 cents apiece . feather blades extremely sharp ! gillette sensor more practical me when big hurry . good old fashioned shave using double edge safety razor , badger hair shaving brush , some proraso shave cream tube alot more enjoyable relaxing me !	-1

i bought this cushion because i move california new york expected drive torture my back . i researched these types cushions decided get this one because it lot motors compared cheaper units , because i recently bought mogu pillow really liked soft feel i t--t his cushion " sqush , " which similar feel . cushion middle portion sqush which concentrated into 3 " lumps " -- your shoulders , lower back , under front part your thighs , near your knees . lumps soft squishy covered spandex-like material . rest cushion feels like fleece . when i first plugged it , i immediately disappointed weakness wimpy motors . even highest intensity ( i never even bother lower two ) , it felt like nothing more moderate vibration -- definitely not enough un-knot aching back . pre-set programs fine but i rarely use them . it comes straps but i hard time trying install it my car because instructions non-existent it wasn't intuitive all . i ended up just attaching them some hardware underside chair , which worked well . i can't decide if cushion made drive any more bearable . lower back cushioning filled my lumbar region fine but shoulder padding must too thick because it pushed my shoulders forward forced me into slight hunched position which strained my back made it hurt . thigh cushioning made it slightly difficult slide into seat because it effectively raises level seat ( my car doesn't fancy seat controls ) i wedge myself into seat . massaging feature helpful because it fun thing boring drive it helped little keep circulation going , but it simply wasn't powerful enough really effective . worse thing thigh motor died only few hours into my trip !! it 2 year warranty , but you pay $5 " handling " fee ! i'm mad myself throwing away box because if i hadn't , i'd return it amazon wash my hands it . overall , this cushion underpowered , unreliable , not orthopedically correct it should . it definitely not worth outrageous price . i regret not buying simple lumbar cushion instead . i wish i saved my money homedic highly rated shiatsu seat cushion instead , although i'm somewhat leary their product reliability now	-1

this unit all marketing features , date , time , memory stores up 48 prior readings date time , but there one problem its not acurate . my doctor said wrist cuffs -10% off just because taking reading wrist not arm next heart , just like taking your bp right arm . further you heart lower your readings . example : doctor takes my bp then i take it cuff monitor he/she sys its 110/56 54 beats/min where this one reads 151/93 60 beats/min . we tried it several times each time it incorrect . so he told me not use it . i bought simular unit , no date , time screen , but stores 99 prior readings , tested again doctor nurse found it within limits . she said you never get same reading twice row . some nurses doctor even take three readings take average .	-1
i am african american woman long , chemically relaxed hair . full-time undergraduate student , i cannot afford visit salon weekly basis . i purchased this flat iron whim market because my previous flat iron recently shorted out ( it older model no swivel cord ) . i chose this flat iron because it same brand my last one , i overwhelmingly satisfied its performance . i cannot say same this product . retrospect , it exactly what it claims , but nothing beyond . my previous flat iron , i could straighten style my layered hair same time , which significantly cut amount heat damage my hair endure . any attempts style my hair underwhelming say least . after using flat iron , my hair looked fizzy unkempt , even bit damaged . any curls i managed produce looked undefined limp . it chance i purchased curling iron addition flat iron , able successfully style my hair after wrapping my hair overnight applying frizz control serum . needless say , you won't able produce " fresh salon " look this flat iron , which sadly exactly what i needed . i not feel confident my hair when stepping out house after using this product . if you don't use this tool anything but sleek , straight looks bottle frizz serum handy , then this great product you . while i am not happy its results , it now . i'll saving better iron while praying straightening curling my hair doesn't leave it severely damaged .	-1

i use three razors . last year model this braun , triple blade rotary leading manufacturer rotary razors standard double edged disposables major manufacturer razors . ok , now , let some math . i get 10 great shaves disposable razor . i pay , average , 40c or so disposable razor . nickel shave including shave cream . nickel shave , it would take 3000 shaves before i would spend $150 . would take me over 8 years . now , anyone says any electric razor shaves better than double edged high quality blade razor ( not even expensive triple edged ones , just cheap disposables ) dreaming . blace much better job much faster . but , sometimes , they irritate skin , but electrics too . i get irritated both , sooooo , i rotate them , find reduces my skin irritation problem quite well . i bought this braun ( last year model ) after reading positive reviews here , later bought rotary razor . basic difference cheap model rotary major manufacturer much quieter , shaves just well , cost me 1/3 price . only thing better braun battery lasts longer . it possible also , some cases , it gives slightly closer shave than rotary , but it also tends miss spots no matter how many times i go over them . braun also problem my beard when it longer , like when i two three days growth . rotary disposable razor breeze through three day bush . cleaning machine/charger comes braun joke . yes , it cleans razor great , but it way oversized you need large space it your bathroom . even then , say you larger space , you pay $5.00 $8.00 each cleaning cartridges . i found they last month before drying out . add $60 your annual cost just clean your razor . rotary cleans fine brush disposable razors water . finally , switch turns razor right where you hold razor it also locks blade . so i am constantly locking blade position accident . inexcusable design flaw razor this price . don't get me wrong . this razor shaves fine . it works best short beards works better than cheap razors . but $50 you get better rotary razor $150 you shave over 8 years disposable twin blade . price difference sound rational you ? if it , click " proceed order "	-1

ok i picked up corded vidal sassoon hairclipper target . thing so absolutely horrible i come amazon vent it . blades seemed blunt , if not nonexistent . it would only cut little tufts hair , hair taut , literally held my fingers . it literally tried rip hair out my head . my follicles still hurt hour or so i spent trying shave my head this terrible clipper . most hair i actually successfully removed , due scissors . lubrication blade adjustment screwdriver no effec t--t he blades weren't * stuck * , they just * suck . * i don't care how much money vidal sassoon spends trying portray themselves trendy cutting edge fashion maintenance -- judging this horrible experience , they really , really not know how make decent hairclipper . i shaved my head plenty times over last few decades , i seen some bad clippers , but never i experienced clipper so bad it would probably bested haircut given sharpened stone instead .	-1

this remington razor actually too sharp if you ask me . i used it period several weeks it caused my face blister it actually gave me more cuts than 10 cent disposable razor . ouch . however , shave very close - expect use lot cooling lotion this razor . design shaver mechanically fine appears fairly reliable - although its touch hard clean because blades super sharp underneath foils . i owned norelco braun more than 15 years whole found them more agreeable shave	-1
scale everything manufacturer claims . however , minimal use one average sized adult , our scale lasted only nine months . balance part scale very sound , but battery clip powers electronics poorly designed built very cheap components . i suspect poor qa result fairly high percentage these units failing recommend you go elsewhere . today , my scale not function unless i hold batteries hand ( not too practical when someone standing it ... ) . conclusions : * scale design nice -- looks good . * construction balance components solid , glass very strong . design construction power unit ( battery ) rather poor . * scale functions advertised normal sized ( 80kg/175lb ) adult ... until battery power clip dies . * buyers should avoid this scale favor something more solid battery compartment connections . hope this helps !	-1
i purchased this item middle may . it now oct . 1st it won't heat up anymore ! product should last longer than 5 months !	-1
i bought 5 these crappy pads all 5 stopped working after short period . buy sunbeam 902 flexible heating pad -- much more reliable useful too	-1
i ordered two these heating pads paid more because it looked like they better cover , instead usual cheap cotton cloth cover looks like rag after washed once ... well , they different cover , but listing amazon didn't say pads shut-off after one hour . i am capable turning off heating pad myself , don't need/want any auto shutoff . these two heating pads going right back . i get regular heating pads don't auto shutoff down local discount store half price	-1
i first bought standard , then large size attempt pair fit well . i used them riding bike winter months . neither pair fit well there most likely very few people who obtain good fit . goggles snug enough prevent wind entering ( prevent tearing ) causes great pressure above ear . rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely . i retired my clics when i found foam padded sunglasses motorcyclists .	-1
i purchased this humidifier , it worked wonderfully soothing blue night light my son week . one night , it just stopped producing humidifying mist could not coaxed into working again . i called company , who told me promptly cut cord throw it out , they would sending new one replace it ( no cost shipping me ) . i received new one week later , which my disappointment , not nightlight feature . i also noticed it different brand company . i can't remember name but it also began word " sun . " so far , new humidifier working fine ( 2 weeks now ) , but it lower water capacity so i refill it every night ( vs . every 2 nights original one ) lack nightlight big disappointment . process replacing , however , very smooth also free so i'll give them 2 stars	-1

i overwhelmed choices , selected this model , part , because reasonal price . i read reviews which mentioned problems need return product , but i decided there only small possibility happening . instructions said use lowest setting initially , which certainly made sense . however , instructions said move adjustment " toward tip " , which turned out highest , not lowest setting ! diagram handle indicated movement toward larger opening , but i read directions not look diagram until later . spray very powerful actually " hurt " , especially when it my tooth crown . next day i tried adjusting settings pik over my sink , not my mouth ! it felt wonderful lower setting ! i reread directions again ( again over next several days ) see if error mine or theirs . i still think directions not written properly . third day i trouble getting any spray all . this continued week , some days getting more or less , but never full spray any setting ! my guess it permanent " pause " mode . i gave up pursued returning item . it needed returned " authorized repair " , which luckily only few miles away ( there only three my state ) . repair man told me , over phone , it discontinued model hadn't made year . when he looked it , he found it made 2006 . he said he could fix it , but wasn't allowed ; i am awaiting replacement arrive mail .	-1

i found ms-5700 very loud . braun 8995 i replaced it very quiet . plastic chrome body gives it very cheap feel , look , it makes it hard hold onto . i found shaver dosn't give me very close shave compared braun 8985 shaver . solution tank cleaner seems not user friendly braun 8985 holds cartridge slips out replace . you read i replaced ms-5700 already braun 8985 , am very happy change . braun also came 3 cartridges cleaner unit , not just one bottle pour into cleaner .	-1

i recently purchased obus forme lowback backrest , seat cushion . although i heard people rave excellent support , they felt comfortable enough me , i can't give them more than 2 stars . material used their construction drove me distraction . this obviously personal preference type thing . other folks may no issues material all . these just my feelings matter : i found texture fabric little rough it didn't allow easy movement when sitting on/leaning against it , which would drive me crazy after just few hours work . also , when making any movements , compression foam , friction it fabric covering , made really annoying noises . it reminded me somewhat snow compressing down when walking it . backrest even worse than seat cushion because it thin plastic wrapping ( looked sort like shrink wrap or saran wrap ) around foam inside , which made loud crinkling noises every time i even twitched . it awful ! however good science behind backrest cushion , sound effects unpleasant texture distracting enough , me least , return both items .	-1

i thought this would ideal product my aging father both his sight his dexterity somewhat impaired . my first thought contact parent company , hy-tek manufacturing , ask dealer referral get some answers few simple operations questions . after 3 days they get back me , recommending amazon purchase source but ignoring my request operations information . i sent second email but it completely ignored . maybe this should warning . i decided go ahead order one anyway . purchasing process quick easy delivery form amazon agent 5 days , more than acceptable . unit comes well packaged easy follow instructions . actual programming simple very straight forward . problems started after successfully programming my dad satellite receiver . main menu could not accessed , information button non-functional two numeric keys not work . i tried all codes listed manufacturer receiver , none them made any difference . email hy-tek , 3 day wait , produced response " it doesn't work all devices i guess it just won't work your receiver , you'll send it back supplier . we make note this maybe we add this receiver future update . " no help all no concern or consideration expressed part manufacturer . if they bothered respond my original inquiry first place , i would never purchased this substandard piece equipment wouldn't out freight charges . one questions i asked originally " it access main menu ?

these hair topia pills nothing but garbage ! pure nonsense ! trust me , i know this because i used buy them . i first bought these pills last year june 2005 after hair formula 37 unsuccessful promise producing longer stronger hair four months usage . well , these pills not expensive previous brand mentioned , promised also change dry brittle hair long healthy , it absolute nothing . i said myself , like hair formula 37 , maybe i just need give this more time , so i bought 2-month supply gave it 3 months all there no difference all . this product might just work others , which it , but it certainly didn't work me . i must admit i brought this myself , my mother warned me not buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they nothing hair grows naturally anyway , if you really want get hair pills then just buy them whole lot cheaper regular stores like giant or even hair vitamins damn dollar store ! these hair growth pills too damn expensive , so when you paying all money then you expect it work . fact it not infuriating because $39.99 + $7 shipping , total little over $46 , lot money spend something nothing . thus , i am here warn others not waste their precious money . if you going , please don't it this site-you buy this product little cheaper hairboutique.com .	-1

before you buy , sure check where pen made . i number older cross pens say " usa " near top , they great pens . however , i bought three different ones past few years not indicate where they made , they inferior quality . top bottom halves loose , carefully manipulated come together without gap . first one i got , i sent it back cross warranty repair under their " lifetime guarantee , " only receive it back unchanged telling me it just fine - " handling fee " attached . i willing believe it simply anomaly , one bad pen . so later when some new colors came out , i bought two more - only see they same quality defect . my advice : if you want good cross pen , go secondhand store buy one made usa . they aren't making them same anymore .	-1

i surprised find positive reviews this heating pad , since i just returned mine after one use . perhaps one i got defective , but even highest setting this heating pad barely warm touch wasn't hot enough penetrate my sore back muscle . i also thought convenience strapping pad would excellent target lower back area , found shape pad flimsy elastic strap provided very uncomfortable wear . placement strap doesn't allow pad conform body , but only press against it where strap runs through - just center , not rest pad . i realize there probably now safety standards heating pads preclude them getting too warm , but hopefully they not so stringent not allow any electric heating device getting warm enough penetrate sore muscles properly . time i'll keep wearing thermacare(tm ) back wraps ( which expensive - could bought two heating pads now ) but last 8 hours time provide intense enough heat . also , this disposable product surprisingly comfortable wear more directly applies heat area where i need it . if you need intense heat sore back , i'd skip this heating pad	-1

i eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer over year ago because it retractable cord folding capabilities . even price attractive . it really take up little room my bathroom drawer retractable cord plus . i thought i perfect blow dryer because it what it supposed quickly . now bad news : retractable cord became chewed up frayed after daily use it became apparent cord ultimately going fray completely due time . then , folding handle , low behold , broke half one morning . ( course , warranty long expired ) . this dryer too fragile consider using daily basis i consider myself careful person when it comes handling small appliances such hair dryers . when i've replaced hair dryers past , it because they've simply reached end their lifespans burned out . i'd caution anyone consider this before buying because these 2 features alone , while very appealing , shorten otherwise good hairdryer lifespan . i've now purchased t3 tourmaline ( featherweight , quiet hairdryer no retractable cord or folding handle ) which seems work just fine appears much longer lifespan .	-1

i bought this item my wife exactly four months ago ( 9-15-06 ) she said it working well most four months . she concerns because electrical cord which attachs unit rotates when it rotated certain angles , heat would turn off ( indicated green light which either off , flickers or solid ) . she used it , problem became more more frequent . now , unit not work unless it one point certain angle ( which i guess allows electricity go unit ) . i tried taping it location but cord also stay certain angle which impossible maintain when using iron . this not very good such expensive item which gets alot twisting turning use should highest materials workmanship prevent electrical . my wife admits like anyone unit dropped , but should not cause electrical cord problem . dropping iron risks breaking two flat iron ceramic plates , which still perfectly intact . problem because cord , way flat iron used , there alot cord twisting . what advertised " professional " device cost which only professional would normally purchase , we cannot believe this could used " professional " environment . my wife only uses it six or seven times week , not six or seven times day like salon . we highly recommend you stay away this product .	-1

this isn't what i thought it would . instructions unclear , so i refer box guess how install it . i finally figured it out after 10 minutes fiddling it . you push down top get more than tiny bit gel out - so it takes two hands . means once you put gel your face , you get gel machine . i set mine machine hottest setting it feel warm . this must safety thing , but i can't imagine what lower settings . gel cools extremely fast , so time you apply it your face , only gel where you first apply it feels warm . i same machine foam worked lot better , but i don't use foam shaving creme anymore . once i use up this gel , hot gel machine gets retired .	-1

my bedroom receives inordinate amount morning light , light sleeper , i've tried numerous ways protect my slumber . it doesn't help my husband ( god love him ) snores loud small jet plane . i've tried silicone ear plugs satin eye masks only find plugs make me feel like i head cold masks leave unwanted gaps let light . i received tranquility zone eye mask birthday present i could hardly wait try it . i love this thing ! it thick large enough block out all light , due design , mask positioned perfectly over my ears . sounds pleasant ( i'm big fan " babbling brook " track ) i love able plug my mp3 player so i listen my own nature-sounds tracks , too . i've given this 5 stars because there no option 4.5 . all honesty , there few drawbacks . first , when i say this thick i'm not kidding . without my a/c summer it might get bit warm . second , sound clips themselves very short loops ... so if you brain like mine tunes what you're hearing you'll notice clip repeats itself every 5 seconds or so . it not this i'd bigger fan first track -- one sounds like you're forest -- but i get distracted ( awakened ) hearing bird sound comes closer then fades . even these things mind , i say i haven't slept this well years . i love this thing , i wish i'd found it earlier . fact , i love it so much i've given it gift two friends who'd tried my mask while they visiting fell love it , too	1

i read these reviews before buying this , i probably wouldn't purchased it . but i looking much more expensive sonicare toothbrushes after my dentist recommended sonicare after i asked . i didn't ask if there certain model he recommended , so i assumed i'd pay $40-$150 sonicare . when i saw this one $30 target , i figured i didn't much lose . i've no problems any other problems mentioned happy how it makes my teeth feel super clean even cleaned this spot even my dental hygienist couldn't get . it turns off automatically after 2 minutes , so i know i'm brushing my teeth longer . one thing takes getting used not removing it while it going ... you'll splatter toothpaste all over yourself ! :d plus not your tummy jiggle like it manual toothbrush !! only negative it goes thru 2 aa batteries once month , but directions said it lasts 60 brushes per battery change that right . i've started using rechargable batteries no problems .	1

jerdon 7p7506cf ( or i call it , ol'6cf ) nice , reflective wall-attachable mirror . i can't say enough how reflective this thing ; i'm bit amateur facepainter ( although i zero artistic ability- my spider-man faces usually end up looking like spotty tomatoes ) , so i need good mirror whenever i self-paint . i gone through three similar models before finding 6cf , none clear user-friendly . short , if you're looking best mirror value your dollar , i can't recommend this thing enough . it mirror 21st century , beyond	1

unlike many other reviewers , i actually bought this shaver use my head . i shaving my head past 2 years during time used panasonic es8066 . it fine product ( able used either wet or dry , unlike braun ) , but i no idea upgrading braun 8985 would make such difference . i shaved my head one third time it took me using panasonic ! no longer i need keep going over same spot again again . braun took off hair one or two passes , cutting just close considerable ease less irritation . i can't believe i wasted two years shaving my old shaver ! i know panasonic since come out new improved shavers , i can't comment its new vortex shaver , but i know i won't returning my new braun any time soon	1

over years various jobs , i seen this flashlight several times . it abused subjected most terrible chemical physical abuse . it may end up looking beat up yucky , but they always work , no matter what contractor or whomever it . if you need reliable flashlight toolbox , work truck , pick-up glove compartment , etc ., this only one you need . if you need good flashlight home , tired buying throwing out all those junky flashlights grocery store , this one last flashlight you ever buy . i finally bought one just my home , i am only sorry i not this years ago ( i am also happy one these things not totally beat up like one my toolbox ; i refuse replace it ) . i like this version because it strong magnet , you stick onto refrigerator or side your truck . i also like it switch guards , so it not accidentally turned because it buried beneath 25# stuff your toolbox . one nit-picky complaint . it clip spare bulb behind reflector . however , it comes empty you supply your own , so buy spare bulb same time you buy this flashlight .	1

i all set typical 10 day antibiotic course sinus infection ( i even bought antibiotics ) , but decided try this first . it very effective clearing sinuses , nose , throat lungs . couple things : 1 . it makes minor mention using solution ( if desired ) tank provided . i used vicks . it more than doubles steam output . so even if you don't get solution , use plain water . without it , output not impressive . 2 . if you get vicks , get your magnifying glass out read dilution instructions . they not make it clear without reading fine print it highly concentrated solution . if you add it undiluted , i think you'll go blind ... i highly recommend this unit	1

i really liked this product . i am late 30 woman whose skin basically pretty good . i occasional mild breakouts some blackheads , but even before i bought neutrogena microdermabrasion i would receive compliments how smooth my skin . but around age 35 i looked mirror realized my skin getting middle-age dullness it . unwilling pay professional microdermabrasion , i decided try neutrogena home system . neutrogena microdermabrasion cream easy apply . cream slightest pleasant smell , not sticky all . i used well less than teaspoon , so little goes long way . it no problem rinse it off my face water , sponge very easy clean well . treatment took me less than 10 minutes , fit easily my bedtime routine , after initial start-up treatments you only need it couple times week . my skin definitely felt softer , smoother more invigorated . i could notice difference after only one treatment . but real proof came way my husband double take couple days later commented i looked younger . ( he didn't know microdermabrasion . ) even my 6 year old daughter told me my face looked pretty . there clear noticeable difference -- after only few treatments my middle-aged dull skin definitely gotten back some its youthful glow , few large pores i appear smaller . lazy , i not incorporated it into my regular routine like i should , but i pull it out few days before special occasions , vacations , or anytime i feel need little brightening up , definitely always keep it hand . if you particularly sensitive skin , this may not great product you , it bit , well , abrasive . me , it painless process , i would highly recommend it anyone looking give their skin more youthful glow	1

i bought epilator because i tired shaving my legs waxing just too expensive me . i've my epilator several weeks now i am already seeing amazing results ! i used it first time my legs . i'm not going lie ... it painful . i just made sure go slowly , pausing every few inches , making sure my skin pulled tightly i could get it . eventually , i able get most thick , dark hairs off my legs . ** please know epilator not immediate " cure-all " . hair grows stages , so soon you get rid some hairs , several more grow behind them . ( eventually you probably get rid most all them , but it take some time . ) because this , it good try epilating couple times week . since it winter , i just let it all grow out so epilator get more hairs . however , when new hair grows , i am finding they thinner blonde instead dark brown . it doesn't hurt nearly much pull those out ! i also know i'll able this spring summer because hair lighter . my legs smoother i don't get razor burn ! right after epilating , sometimes i experience little irritation but , unlike razor burn , it goes away after just short time . neat thing , unlike waxing , epilator grab teeny tiny almost invisible hairs . this gives your skin smoother feel it gets hairs beginning stages growth ! i used wait two weeks or so my hair grow long enough waxed . now , i get smoother skin just whenever i want ! i little nervous first spending money product i not heard much . exception few reviews i read online , i pretty much dark . i went ahead went it , then realized this thing paid itself two weeks ! not only i epilated my legs , i also used it under my arms , my upper lip , my bikini line . results better than i could imagined !! again , i'm not going lie ... ouch !!!!! epilating under my arms hurt initially they sore few days ( i very thick hairs ) . however , i got majority hairs after first time , i realized i'm never going shave again ! yes , some little blonde hairs grow back , but they all thinner much less painful . fact , sometimes it tickles little . :o ) i epilate there once twice week ( five minute job if you're careful , two if you're hurry ) i smoother underarms ! i used get my upper lip waxed once month . now i just epilate . it hurts , but just second . plus , i keep up it so instead 50 hairs pulled once hot wax , i only need pull 5-10 each time . ** word caution : our skin more sensitive some areas , so if you choose epilate around bikini line , careful . i managed give myself burn going too slowly rotating " blade " . now i just make sure i don't leave it one place more than couple seconds . if i miss some hairs , i come back time get them . this epilator comes little loufa pad help reduce ingrown hairs ( i've only few pad fixes them ) little cleaning brush . epilator very easy clean . top ( dark purple section ) pops off you run it under hot water . when it dries , you put it back . ** note , epilator not store hairs inside it . when they pulled out , they tend either gather front epilator ( i stop periodically wipe them off ) or they go flying . i sit towel when epilating catch most hairs . i hope this review helpful you your decision buying epilator . i am very satisfied this product i recommend it anyone who least little pain tolerance really wants get rid hair stop shave all time . ** few minutes pain worth it ??? absolutely ! :o )	1
i decided buy this product before i read reviews . my opinion trays stay better than strip kind . there alot whitening goo you press into your teeth it helps trays stay place . first morning goo came totally out my bottom tray but becuase i pressed too hard . i havent problem since . i noticed difference after 3 days they much whiter after 7 days . my gums turned white if whitening goo touched them full 45 minutes felt tingly hurt slightly . pick color returned within hour . it really isnt bad other reviewers make it seem . all all if you looking product works , this good one . i truly surprised how well they worked . i purchasing these future	1
this model all features elite 9500 ( 2 brush heads , 2 cleaning modes , programmable quadpacer , guage indicate how much charge remaining battery ) , but it $12 cheaper amazon ! all " programmable quadpacer " feature amounts ability leave it extra ( i.e. , fifth ) 30-second interval , or ability turn timer off so it just on/off . i regard most features functional ornamentation ( " bells whistles " ) , but elite 9800 also happens dependable , super-lightweight model run good three weeks charge only one person using it . i went three-week trip didn't bother pack my charger , it charge spare when i got back . note : i always allow nicd battery run all way down ( exhaustion ) before charging it , enhances both charge battery life . ( nicd only so many charge cycles . ) if this your first electric , you might like way it comes out box programmed gradually ramp-up power over first fourteen brushings . what difference 9800 9500 ? models appear identical . only difference i found one comes box says 9800 , other says 9500 . :-)	1

i purchased this hair dryer unusual reason : my old 1875 watt conair actually too much wattage my bathroom ( circuit kept tripping ) , so i actually looking dryer less wattage . however , i didn't want sacrifice power , i hoped not devote any additional drying time my shoulder-length hair . so far , i've pleased this hair dryer . it seem bit louder than my previous model -- not obnoxiously so , just higher , more concentrated fan noise . dryer extremely light compact ; it actually smaller than my folding travel dryer . it very basic , choice high/low settings only ( there no heat/cool option ) , but it seems dry my hair just efficiently my old higher-wattage dryer . overall , this very good basic hair dryer which gives you wide variety use options great price	-1

i tried ear thermometers never could get them work . our pediatrician used one these " rub across forehead " kind her office during checkup said it accurate ear kind much easier use ... especially when kids earaches ( ... grabbing itty-bitty earlobe sticking hard end into swollen , sore ear canal ??? ... ouch . ) minute practice ( after reading instructions ) , you get hang using it never dread checking temperatures again	1

i preemie who temperature needs monitored pretty much constantly . every diaper change we taking axial temps one those standard digital thermometers . torture ! took forever baby screamed her head off whole time . then my sister got this thermometer us it fabulous . what we like : 1 . when baby screaming , light blinks then goes solid when temp , great when you can't hear beep . 2 . it truly take second unless baby thrashing . 3 . produces long beep when you taking your own temperature , no guesswork when it finished which improvement over earlier models . what we don't like : 1 . preemies tiny ear holes . so we wait till our baby ear big enough able use this thing . 2 . lens covers pain switch out keep hand , it would nice if there way just sanitize lens after each use . 3 . we see discrepancy almost one degree left right ear which makes us question accuracy somewhat . enclosed brochure explains various causes this , but doesn't help when trying determine what exactly your baby temperature . we both axial ear temp found right ear our baby corresponds digital thermometer reading her armpit . however , enclosed chart shows variances oral , rectal , axial , ear temperatures which make it somewhat confusing . so we alternate digital ear thermometer just sure . i personally would recommend this thermometer older babies kids , just sure you test it out when kids healthy figure out your baseline what normal . it takes some investigation develop your method based what your needs , but it nice , quick use product my family loves using it adult temperature readings . we think we happier it when baby bigger we using it sick readings only	-1

this one nicest electric shavers i've owned first we t-t ype shaver . i previously owned norelcos over decade . original norelcos ( made holland ) fine but recent ones pathetic quality they literally pull hair ! it painful ! i eventually gave up trying use my replacement lift-and-cut norelco decided try out high end model cost close two hundred dollars . bad idea - you don't always get what you pay ! i not quite happy either after two year haitus disposable gillettes , decided try wet shaver . i took my chance this one , based solely reviews here . this very first " wet " shaver i've used absolutely love it . it gives close enough shave but not too close . you use it whatever shaving cream you use . note panasonic manual encourages using cheapest foam type ( not gel ) , barbasol like stuff this shaver . it also comes basic carrying pouch cleaning easy it get ( just wash thing under tap water ) . they really meant this unit washable . it recharagable , lasts seven days charge , costs less than replacement blades competing brands . build quality excellent . charger very clever design gets shaver completely off your counter space . you cannot go wrong this . amazon great value here . sometimes you get more than you asked this one those rare things . highly recommended .	1

i installed this unit my basement 6 months ago , it working flawlessly ever since . things i noticed : if power goes out , unit not turn back automatically ( some other units . ) if you want use continuous drainage ( which i highly recommend ) via hose , you punch out plastic disc side unit . i would designed screw-type plug replacable , but they didn't think . anyway , once you punch quarter-size disc out it out forever . if you choose use continuous drainage feature , you need pick up hose inner diameter 15mm ( . 59 " or just over half inch . ) i went local diy center found some clear tubing worked well . unit operate down 2-degrees ( 36-degrees ) , which great continuous operation garage keep tools rusting . three fan settings : med , high quiet . " quiet " really quiet , could probably work just fine bedroom . though , it warm room it . how much it warms it depends humidity setting . four settings : humidty level ( humidstat ) set " continuous dehumidification " ( which default setting ) , 50% , 60% 70% . fan continue run but dehumidification processor turn off when it reaches selected humidity level . cool . i mean , that when fan just blow room-temp air . full drainage tank stop unit illuminate " tank full " indicator ligh t.t he unit not heavy -- maybe some , but not nearly heavy some people make it sound . it 30.8 pounds . according instructions : you need least 21 cm ( 8 inches ) clearance front , behind side side . air blows out top unit , so you'll need make sure it clear well . there movable louvers top direct air straight up , 45-degrees or almost straight ahead . power consumption : cfm-25e 220w // cfm-40e 330wi highly recommend this model dehumidifier	1

shavers fall into two categories , those who prefer rotaries like norelco those who prefer foil shavers . those you who like foil shavers , this one you ! i've owned latest braun 8985 it excellent , while it lasted ... charger kept breaking me ( once first month [ 11/2006 ] , then time 4 months later [ 3/2007 ]) . it expensive , refills pain , pricey , but they worked . after two exchanges i decided try norelco 8140xl ( speed xl)rotaries , while they shaved really close , they tore up my neck . problem only got worse . returned 3 weeks later . i just got panasonic say it definitely shaves closer than both tried razors . they shave much faster than braun norelcos . i'm not sure if i like " side side " pivoting head , only time tell . heads don't pivot up down much braun , but once again , time tell if this necessary . one major advantage it cleans soap water ... no expensive refills hassle over . panasonic two noticeable downsides : 1 . it louder than other shavers , but who cares ? it shaves incredibly fast anyway . 2 . you can't plug it shave ... you wait until battery charged charger disconnected turn it . this my favorite razor far .	1

this pedometer accurate you could reasonably expect . features suitable it even looks good . only problem i this product minor , it why i gave item 4 stars , rather than 5 . plastic holder/belt clip comes pedometer cheaply made very puny little spring . if you don't plan using belt clip , this definitely 5 star item . otherwise , just treat holder gently hopefully it last longer than mine , because omron won't sell holder seperately . holder only weakness speak if omron redesigns it , this 5 stars across board ( record , i wouldn't let my opinion holder stop me buying one . i'd make same suggestion anyone who fence - buy it .	-1

once , i don't " public service " going clifbar.com looking up ingredients nutritional information ; amazon.com it all top product page . now , i focus taste!that good thing , because this ( clif z-bar , chocolate ) one better tasting " nutritional " snacks its kind . it just enough chocolate ( brought you chocolate chips ( which include organic cane juice , unsweetened chocolate , cocoa butter , unspecified " natural flavors " ) actually impart chocolate flavor . not heavy or rich chocolate flavor , but unmistakable one : you don't close your eyes , convince yourself it chocolate . ( ever notice how permeable artificial flavors ? let say you're eating popsicle -- excuse me -- frozen fruit treat . you close your eyes , flavor clues all but gone . think purple , its tastes like grape ; think orange , it orange , think light blue it bubble gum -- if you know code , . ) this like giant bit-o-honey candy , it chewy texture over laden honey , some sticky peanut butter chocolate thrown , you've pretty much captured flavor . my surprise , there no honey , taste derives somehow syrups , malt , cane juice , fig paste , other sweet ingredients . it definitely filling , especially if accompanied apple or something , least eight ounces water . it very chewy , yet it doesn't seem dry similar products . could it six grams fa t-t wo which saturated ? yes , two grams saturated fat ! not good . i'll try balance fact it made 70% organic ingredients , whopping 11 grams protein , only 20 grams sugar ( compare other brands flavors ) , includes five grams fiber . clif z-bar excellent clif apple raisin walnut , this one better tasting its kind -- just don't expect brownie	1
best sports bar around . great taste , organic , contains plenty antioxidants , contains good amount protein . only down side high amount carbs , especially sugars , but i still give it five stars	1
after trying many pre-shaving products i found this best one . only problem it hard find , when i i usually buy several	1

these bars so delicious , you worried they're just candy bars . but they're not ! they packed energy nutrition keep you going keep you healthy too . flavor variety unmatched market . peanut butter chocolate chip peanutbutter my favorites , but oatmeal raisin walnut also excellent , especially if you hiking canteen water go their very natural deliciousness	1
if you looking new ways incorporate soy products into your life , clif bars one best tasting energy bars market . i've given up trying other bars mostly disappointingly filled all sorts oils i can't eat . take cottonseed example it everything ! not mention , peanut butter all palm kernel oil saturating health bar market . ingredients carrot cake bar : organic brown rice syrup , soy protein isolate , rice flour , malt extract , organic soy flour , organic roasted soybeans , organic rolled oats , organic evaporated cane juice , organic dried apples , cocoa butter , soy lecithin , natural flavors , apple fiber , oat fiber , organic milled flaxseed , chicory extract , psyllium , organic soy butter , dried carrots , raisins , coconut , sea salt , nutmeg , cinnamon cloves . each bar 240 calories delicious breakfast cup tea . i eat clif bar almost every morning never really feel overly hungry during day . gary ( owner clif bar inc . ) seems also found out " other " energy bars not really tasty . after his " epiphany , " he spent lots time his mom kitchen working making cliff bars . what guy ! i point where i trying make my own granola bars , but after discovering these bars , i'm hooked . they portable , delicious basically , i love all flavors . you take them biking , hiking , walking , anywhere . this bar especially delicious i seem fall love it again each october . must spices creamy white chocolate chips . there just enough chocolate chips remind you cream cheese icing . if i choose piece carrot cake one these bars , bar would win . also look cranberry apple cherry bars pumpkin spice bars . ~ therebeccareview.com	1
although it kept time ( which indicates batteries good ) this didn't work first day i used it . it worked second day . it stopped working third day battery cover broke off sometime during day lost . this complete waste $19	-1

i'm 26m , 6 ' 185 growing . work out regularly , mostly weights basketball . i'm allergic peanuts , which makes most protein bars off-limits me . this only bar i've found where non-peanut flavors don't contain trace amounts peanuts set off my allergies . incredible , if only reason . but there more . 20g protein . wow . this meal replacement if you're road or it mid-morning , early-evening or even late-night snack , especially if you're trying build lean muscle shooting 1.5 or more grams protein per pound body weight . it easy 20 . carbs real , review says . it clean energy , effective either before or after workout . i prefer take liquid protein after workout , body absorbs it faster , but pinch this would great choice . beyond it little crispy little chewy , there physical satisfaction eating it makes experience complete . but , review said , this isn't intended diet bar , it men women who work hard use lots energy throughout day , hence name " builders bar . " i guess if you ate half one instead meal , it might work way . finally taste outstanding , when stacked against other bars ( although i haven't tried many , due peanut allergies ) . if you close your eyes pretend , it really could dessert . i stick cookies cream or chocolate . chocolate yummy dunked hot coffee mid-morning . i buy box every two weeks keep stocked home , work oftentimes one car just case i get hungry . review said outside chocolate got crumbly , this true , if it gets hot melted . when things solidify they crumble . doesn't change taste but it messy . keep them cool you're good shape . i've even tried putting them freezer prior eating , not bad but no significant difference . thank you clif	1
these bars absolutely fantastic . they very nutritious good amount protein ( 20g ) . they taste pretty good , far better than most bars . i prefer builder bar cookies cream flavor clif bar flavor . out flavors my current favorite cookies cream , next peanut butter , then chocolate . chocolate mint flavor just released but i yet try it . i recommend these bars anyone looking healthy snack or needing protein working out	1
i actually bought this book based all negative reviews it not enough " fill blanks . " i wanted baby book would give me topic let me journal it without too much prompting . there few fill-in pages ( see below ) , but most part i write my feelings thoughts my baby my own words . this seems like much more personal approach , one i think my son appreciate more when he old enough read it , than fill blank pages . previous reviewer complained pages thin newspaper-like . true , they simple white pages black titles , but pages themselves not all flimsy -- thicker than average novel page more like lightweight cardstock . illustrations small , simple , non-intrusive . black white line drawings more iconic than cutesy . my only complaint this baby book i would like more topics ( birth story , tooth chart , food , favorite expressions , favorite toys/games . . . ) however , pages look like they 11 " 8.5 " it bound ribbon , so i think little creativity , cardstock hole punch i may able add my own pages . topics covered ( one full page allowed per topic ): baby name ( fill blanks)family tree ( line illustration fill blanks)all momall dadexpectationsparties showers ( 2 pages)first impressionsbirth certificatehandprintsfootprintslock hairvisitors giftsfirst family photofirsts ( fill blanks)baby favorite thingsdoctor visitsgrowth chart ( fill blanks)medical records ( fill blanks)first birthdaysecond birthdaythird birthdayfirst vacationholidays celebrationsletter momletter dadkeepsakesreflections there also small pouch baby first haircut , pockets back store cards , documents other loose memorabilia	-1

i went too long without replacing blades foil my shaver . shaving getting real chore . but replacing these like getting whole new shaver ! it sounded felt different , i could feel i getting much closer shave . only reason 4 stars rather than 5 after month or so use , i noticed blades already dulled bit . i may start replacing mine every 6 months or so . but even then , compared what people pay those refills their fancy mach 7 nitro nuclear fission razors , i think we're getting good deal	-1

i offer this not professional opinion . there no consensus this . i just offer this off-the-record word-of-mouth opinion . but ... past several weeks , i heard few different psychiatrists i work , people i respect , tell me they patients who take omega-3 fatty acid supplements believe it helps mood stabilization . ( this , addition other well publicized below-the-neck benefits . ) so , take it what it worth . it relatively benign supplement , i've heard people worry mercury but it should filtered out any quality supplements . if it helps , great . if it doesn't help , no harm . probably . again , i'm not talking double-blind controlled studies , just cocktail party quality anecdotes . even so , i thought you'd want me share . they always say it better get your nutrition foods opposed supplements , but if you eat enough fish get same equivalent omega-3 fatty acids , you consuming some mercury . i'm not toxicologist , i don't know how big deal or isn't . given my off-the-record opinion , i'll now give my expert opinion : talk your doctor any supplements or herbal medications you interested taking . , please , talk your doctor if you feel you need mood stabilizer this hasn't professionally evaluated . if your doctor too much hurry , or too dismissive , time new doctor	1

i love my homedic diffuser , esp . gurgling brooke sounds , but after trying each four " aromatherapy " beads , i much prefer use round cosmetic cotton pad few drops pure essential oils . beads kind stinky , though they claim contain essential oils , any experienced nose tell you they definitely include synthetic fragrance oils , well . if you want fragrance your room , you'll better candle or spray , but i would never use those things personally . aromatherapy isn't based fragrance . it based specific traits specific plants flowers , which incredibly concentrated potent their distilled form . if substance you're smelling isn't pure essential oil , or adulterated synthetic perfumes , it not therapy . it just aroma . good , inexpensive alternative pick up 2 or 3 pure eos your local health store . good start- lavender , peppermint , eucalyptus , lemon . learn qualities these oils , basic book or google search , experiment drop or two cotton pad your diffuser . you'll enjoy pure aroma it indeed therapeutic	-1

these great reading glasses . i'll down couple pairs these current 8 pairs regular reading glasses . here my list positives negatives . plusses :( 1 ) freak out all your friends when you pull them apart first time . ( 2 ) very convenient - i always them when i want them . ( 3 ) fit comfortably , easy adjust . ( 4 ) no more " hair grease " inside lenses . i don't clean them all time . ( 5 ) no more glasses falling ground ( top my head ) when i bend over . ( 6 ) great geek glasses ! negatives ( all minor ): ( 1 ) if your hair slightly over you ears , you might need " tweak " them occasionally when putting them your face ( i'm thinking i need haircut ) . ( 2 ) when reading kicked-back recliner , they tendency pushed out your nose bit ( i don't read recliner much anyway ) . ( 3 ) you may get annoyed first trying find them - when they're hanging around your neck ! (4 ) don't get clear frames if you're going use them bright fluorescent light setting - too much glare . ( 5 ) great geek glasses ! thanks clic	-1
[ ... ] i big head , i never wear baseball caps , but they fit fine , both ways . i easily gotten habit clicking them together dropping them down my neck . it freaks people out all time , which pretty funny ! i only wear them work , because size makes them not very portable , you can't keep them your purse . only thing really bothers me them , they get smudged easily because i touch them all time open close . also , admitedly , they little dorky hard wear pony tail . i usually slide them under my hair , it more comfortable . but , all all , i love clics . very best thing them i don't put my glasses top my head anymore . i hate way they would always get tangled my hair i rip them out ! ouch !	1

it very good product but ice not decreases pain . so you buy model less expensive . it very nice legs underarms , but not bikini .	-1
i am extremely pleased this product . understand two things : i am moving up electric epilator sugaring , i don't overly heavy hair growth . it works very well , even underarms which sugaring useless . i agree one reviewer folds tricky , but stretching skin helps . i didn't find ice feature all important , but then i sugared before so i familiar stinging ( yes it sting ) . i definitely used product much more than 15 minutes no motor problem , but i only owned it couple weeks so i not speak long-term durability . i would hope person motor trouble trimmed any really long hair(such bikini area beyond if you first time user ) before using because several machines recommend this however directions using satinelle ice six panel wordless cartoon left me scratching my head wondering " this joke ? " especially when warnings cleaning instructions multi-page , mult-language extremely clear instruction booklet : one quibble otherwise great product . there may better better epilator out there so read other reviews . i thought ice would better thing than it , but then i used stinging sugaring - if you never epilated , waxed or sugared - you may find it very important . i liked narrowness it bikini line handling . i wish it light like some other models . still , i am very pleased my purchase	1
my dad actually introduced me this stuff when i college , i am really happy . this stuff incredible getting rid headaches little boost energy when you hungover . only downfall some people whether or not they stomach it , because you drink it pretty quickly . but if you don't mind , then you luck . it works instantly too !! my only problem now i am possibly taking it granted i take it if i even slight hangover , when past i probably wouldn't use it . but just shows how well it works . *** alert *** it appears this product may not sold stores anymore . i've seen it pulled off shelves many drugstores supermarkets , so you may only find it online now . i don't know why , it probably wasn't selling well . maybe it isn't well known yet . my advice .... get it while you !!! it should fixture your medicine cabinet	1

i'm ex-dental hygienist who delved into depths people mouths 20 years , so healthy teeth mean lot me -- especially my own . when in-office dental bleaching first came around , i wasn't interested trying it because , time , i felt i really didn't need it . cost patients then close $500 . ten years later no longer practicing dental hygiene , i ready try some home products market . i regularly used , continue use , whitening toothpaste ( which basically just removes superficial surface stains coffee , etc . ) then i tried night effects " paint " liquid . besides gooey sort pain use ( not mention looking like cletus slack jawed yokel when i went bed -- not attractive look , ladies ) i really didn't see noticeable whitening . it couple years since attempt , so i ready try this product . but i tell you i found it half going price seller well-known online auction site ( which shall remain nameless , but you know one . ) you also go crest website right now ( may 2006 ) get coupon $7.00 off if you want buy it drugstore or supermarket . i found these strips easy apply , but someone large hands or not lot dexterity might bit difficulty . could overcome little practice . they " stick " quite well your teeth , but you also maneuver them around easily if you need reposition them during treatment . i haven't experienced much sensitivity after using them , i back-to-back treatments , which okay if you don't want space them out over course day . you even skip day if your teeth especially sensitive . i upper strips alone first ; way you lighten lowers gradually match upper better . most people aren't concerned whiteness their lower teeth because uppers more visible when smiling . i don't think you'll get " blue-white " teeth like ed mcmahon , but who wants anyway ? especially if you're over 50 , because let face facts -- there lot other things give away your age faster than less-than-white teeth ! ( now if they came out age defying face strips -- face lift box--i'll take one ! ) seriously , renewal whitestrips lighten up my teeth quite nicely got rid grayish look they taken over years also some yellowish areas where enamel become thinned . overall , i'm pretty happy product would use them again when my teeth , inevitably , begin look dull .

i lot research before buying new beard trimmer , it seems most panasonic beard trimmer best one available today instead usual names such norelco , wahl or remington . this particular model seemed best choice based not only it features but price reasonable too . best things this trimmer it cordless , there many settings beard length , there mini trimmer detail touch-up work , it quiet , charge holds long time---i've this trimmer month it still going only 1 charge ! drawbacks blades ( except mini trimmer ) aren't very sharp , you only adjust settings when it off , there more maintenance required than some trimmers require , you careful when removing attaching beard comb . i would say it worth checking out , but it definitely takes few good uses get used it	-1
i'm glad i got it . it light , looks nice works well . smaller head backside really makes difference when you're trying trim your mustache , etc	1
i bought product keep my hair shortest lenght possible . product what it designed , but pulls when going against grain . possibly dull blades or slow speed cutting	-1

i got this item idea using each piece stocking stuffer little girls - i put pretty pink bow each . it comes white cardboard box if given one child gift , it looks like you went got wholesale gift similar items especially since there big label bold capital letters reads " box sold 1 item not open " . best if distributed seperately . each piece cute within itself but too small hand out alone - best when combined primary gift .	-1
i enjoy how these glasses function . i don't lose them there no strings get tangled . people remark them . they little goofy , but fun goofy . enjoy	1
i really excited when i saw these reading glasses split nose bar , how nifty , just wear them looped over back your neck click lens part together whenever you read fine print . great idea , but execution idea not everyone . back piece also hard plastic , rigid , if you long hair , you lift them out under your hair place plastic back strip your mid-skull level , fit them your ears then fit front parts together snap . back you end up looking like you wearing external orthodontic apparatus . i'd like see company put string place hard plastic loops around your neck . magnetic clip brings two lenses together front fabulous idea , two lenses hanging off sides instead whole pair glasses swaying across your front so much more comfortable out way - it just rigid frame back makes me wonder if anyone really tried using these things before they mass manufactured	-1

i bought this epilator 3 months ago here my thoughts it . pros- saves money razors- good large areas- entertaining if you're boredcons- no matter how many times you use it , pain not go away ( you drunk use it your bilini use tranquilizers use your armpits)- ingrown hair problem ( especially bikini area)- hair doesn't grow back much slower than shaving ( after two day you shave anyway smooth)- epilator doesn't pick up fine hair - if it , it just rips it .	-1

this shaveer given me christmas gift . i liked loook titanum blades remington line so i gave it try . i am overall very satisfied razor . company advises you replace screen blades every 6 months but retail store those cost over $25-35 . if you allow your facial stubble get too long this razor pull hair but no where near bad blade . i am pleased it it still shaves ok minor irritation but i not replaced heads screen yet . battery life i would rate very good this type shaver . if you very picky this would make good travel shaver if you not want take your clunky $100+ shaving system	-1

maybe my unit just defective , but here my experience this scale : first impression : it look beautiful . closer inspection : although it german company , manufacturing china . legs body cheap plastic . after switching pounds , i placed scale floor . noone standing , scale started displaying weight measurements quickly changing range 1 30 lbs . i figured it trying calibrate itself zero itself out ( manual not mention anything calibration or zeroing scale out , so i am not sure ) . couple times it display 0.0 , but then it would change again . after couple minutes doing this , scale turned off . manual says after programming , last keypress , it should show 0.0 , then you immediately get scale so it recognizes you next time . me , last keypress , it went back into " calibration " . make story short ... scale showed my weight 150 230 lbs different measurements ! ( my real weight around 210 lbs)at first i thought it problem " calibration " , so i tried resetting scale catching 0.0 reading before getting it . then i tried waiting , hoping it would eventually calibrate itself , but it would always turn off last reading not 0.0 , depending what point calibration stopped , you would get different range readings . getting scale , locks calibration , but even then consecutive readings measurements would vary within 15 lbs range . according soehnle website , accuracy tolerance those scales should within 3 increments . 2 , so even assuming it calibration problem , accuracy still unacceptable . warranty 3 years , not 10 stated amazon website . all features others rave , there ( aut o-o , auto-recognize your settings ) , just hold your fingers crossed it not defectiv e.p.s. amazon return policy it pays return shipping if product defective , if you just don't like it , you pay return	-1

electric razors usually not compete blade shaving cream but this one . results shaving this electric razor close shave no stubble 3 minutes ( heavy beard neck hairs growing sideways it gets them all ) . i know because it tells me how many minutes i used razor keeps track how many minutes left one charge , 60 minutes . self cleaning part works fine also but every time you clean you also charge batteries . cleaning every fourth shave means batteries not nearly discharged . i am concerned they get short memory . other than its great	1

this little different than i imagined it would . you're not going wipe it across your skin like cotton towel , you pretty much blot water off your skin - it stick drag across wet skin . once most water removed then you " towel down " like you're probably used . it very good job it absorbing water dries extremely fast . its very light weight even wet not weigh anything like wet cotton towel . it makes very good sports towel i'll probably taking one me now when i travel after experiencing " sandpaper " towels some motels . i also purchased pet towel different color , only difference it labeled " pet towel " but exactly same size material . overall i'm pleased them think their worth try but probably want large cotton towel my bathroom - i just like feel good rub down plush towel after shower .	-1

zeno worked my cystic acne . it took four days , but cyst gone ! after first full day , there noticable reduction pain size . after two days , there just small red bump . three days almost nothing . fourth day , completely gone . best thing zeno treatments , me it immediately takes away pain cyst . it also reduced swelling much quicker than if i not use zeno . i friend tell me leave zeno place even after ending beep . tip seems get little warmer , but it seemed help my situation . i held zeno place until i heard continuous beeping . please use your own common sense this . i don't consider tip too warm , but some people it may too painful . i used it every three or four hours four days . i used it mostly pain relief cyst . i never expected cyst itself go away . 18 treatments cyst gone no scarring . wish i would this sooner . me it worked . i definitely not " one time it gone " experience . course , mine huge cyst ( one half inch wide ) my chin , so i diligent treatments , sure enough , it completely gone . i made sure i used zeno until there absolutely no bump left all . without zeno , it probably would taken more than week come ugly head , then month it heal ( probably scar ) . it worth it ? me it . i hate inconvenience going dermatologist then waiting office cortisone shot . also my dermatologist office closed weekends which according murphy law when i tend get monster pimples , so this perfect me . tips expensive , but considering cost gas , time , office visit , it still much cheaper alternative . thing i liked , i could use it over makeup . so , while i covered redness concealer , i still able zap cyst right over concealer . pretty nifty device	1
i bought this my daughters room i really like it . vapor stream shows it working soon you turn it within few hours my daughters room warm dewy . only reason i can't give this 5 stars after letting it run all night ( my mistake ) i woke up mess condensation all around base humidifier . table floor mopped up . i'd certainly buy this again but never run it long periods unsupervised	-1
it seems good scent any man . it very clean scent , but also quite sensual same time	1
this product what you want energizer . batteries life digital camera wii controllers great . even 3x than normal batteries . car adapter make it perfect travels . base very think , so very portable too . only thing i complain home charge ac adapter huge compare base o car ac adapter . but charge time really quick too . this product most any aa digital camera or wii owner	1
well designed charging device very good quality . i've bought other two battery chargers , none them better than this . one them plastic cover even melted , deformed sagged . both very hot during recharging . not this energizer charger , always cool touch during charging . snap down snap switch aaa or aa batteries best user-friendly design	1

i bought it when it huge discount . soap smells good too	-1
this good product . excessive jiggling or improper opening " technique " loosen adhesive , but able readhere . snap together lever covers face right or left ... you just pop out circular cover place it reverse side ( designed this way accommodate just this situation -- see instructions )	1
these great especially if you one not eat lot fiber . no messy powders . just pop two day your mouth your set ! you can't beat price two bottles ! if you go store you pay lot more	1
believe it or not , these fiber tablets actually pretty yummy ! sometimes i eat them just because i crave taste . much better than dissolvable ones	1
iam amazed how easy it use ear thermometer . i always taught use oral thermometer . my children love this better they not complain anymore .	1
i bought this themometer when my oldest year old , two years ago . it so much easier than taking temp under armpit or bottom , whole lot faster . i not problems inaccurate readings . others written , you just need get it ear canal right . it little harder our infant b/c she smaller , but it still works . you can't beat price either . finding probe covers bit challenge though	-1
my 2 year old son heavy wetter . after turning 2 he must started urinating more night , because he started leaking out his diaper every single night . we used all different brands , including luvs huggies regular ones . we went size 6 even though size 5 still fit . ( he slim ) . well ... still leaking . i decided get huggies nighttime diapers , but amazon didn't them anymore i couldn't find them our small town . after reading review , i decided try supreme diapers , they worked like charm ! he only leaked out these maybe 2 times , it 6 months . so i highly recommend . i love fit elastic band them . exterior so durable too . i let him run around these without shorts they don't shred like other brands .	1
i am very happy diapers deal i got . if you ordered $99 worth you got $30 free free shipping . i only wish they more selection sizes i ordered next size so they would come immediatley instead month later	1
my son fits into these diapers very nicely . he big boy , 11 lbs when he born . hard time finding diapers fit , still hold without leaking . these very nice , they fit perfect , they don't sag , or fall off . they cost little more than pampers , but worth money .	-1

i bought this scale week ago found it most accurate scale i've ever . it consistent one work i use , which weight balance type . i've found body fat measurement very consistent . tanita recommends monitoring yourself consistent time ( few hours after eating evening ) . i'm consistent . 5% . if i try it any other type , it same . not much variation . however , i am bit skeptical results . both my wife i fairly lean folks ( lucky gene ) . i fall under normal range ( 15%) . however , she consistently registers very low percentage rate ( 7%) - which neither she nor i believe	-1

this product aids over all performance our humidifier adds filters life cycle	1
so much easier keep your humidifier clean .. it really seems limit mold buildup . i would rated it 5 stars if it lasted longer than 30 days	-1
same experience earlier reviewer ... thing leaked like crazy after installation . washer didn't want stay place two pieces didn't thread together snugly . use plumber tape get it stop leaking , even then it touchy . worst yet come -- couldn't get darn thing hold itself upright . it very top heavy ( head size/diameter small pizza ) plastic components just don't support it . it flops forward no matter what we . that fine me , i'm short . my tall husband , it nightmare . after two weeks use , plastic piece holds showerhead cracked . i rubber band it together keep it functioning , which prevents me using it handheld . today , i'm sporting fat lip because thing popped out it jerry-rigged holder smacked me . needless say , i'm ordering something else today . it such inferior product i probably never buy waterpik item -- suspecting they abandoned any quality-assurance standards	-1
i purchased this showerhead after buying much cheaper one left lot desired ! friend white version this showerhead , it seemed like good fit my shower . i bought chrome version because i thought it would hold up better than white one . i really like showerhead ! it heavier than bad showerhead i before , but it works so much better ! it completely adjustable stays place without use any tools . i suppose it would tighter if i used tools ; however , package doesn't recommend it . overall , i think this worth buying	-1
i used jerdon pedismooth pedicure set when it first arrived . i liked it , however , i wish it little more power it . make sure you soak your feet first . overall i would say i good buy	-1

received item record time , good condition . saved money buying replacement heads ( opposed buying whole new razor ! ) didn't go store store find them - good deal	-1
razor awesome . i replaced blades this replacement set , it works fine.amazon.com packaging tremendously wasteful . it mailed 12 " x9 " x4 " box , postage quite high . product itself size index card could sent cd mailer or " letter " -sized package . i understand efficiency they reduce number packaging options , but this seems little excessive . if you bought one cd , would it come foot-long box	-1
once , i don't " public service " going clifbar.com looking up ingredients nutritional information ; amazon.com it all top product page . now , i focus taste!that good thing , because this ( clif z-bar , chocolate ) one better tasting " nutritional " snacks its kind . it just enough chocolate ( brought you chocolate chips ( which include organic cane juice , unsweetened chocolate , cocoa butter , unspecified " natural flavors " ) actually impart chocolate flavor . not heavy or rich chocolate flavor , but unmistakable one : you don't close your eyes , convince yourself it chocolate . ( ever notice how permeable artificial flavors ? let say you're eating popsicle -- excuse me -- frozen fruit treat . you close your eyes , flavor clues all but gone . think purple , its tastes like grape ; think orange , it orange , think light blue it bubble gum -- if you know code , . ) this like giant bit-o-honey candy , it chewy texture over laden honey , some sticky peanut butter chocolate thrown , you've pretty much captured flavor . my surprise , there no honey , taste derives somehow syrups , malt , cane juice , fig paste , other sweet ingredients . it definitely filling , especially if accompanied apple or something , least eight ounces water . it very chewy , yet it doesn't seem dry similar products . could it six grams fa t-t wo which saturated ? yes , two grams saturated fat ! not good . i'll try balance fact it made 70% organic ingredients , whopping 11 grams protein , only 20 grams sugar ( compare other brands flavors ) , includes five grams fiber . clif z-bar excellent clif apple raisin walnut , this one better tasting its kind -- just don't expect brownie	1

this biosilk makes your haie so soft silky . it really work	1
i longish wavy hair i color occasionally . my hair tends frizz up look frazzled out , even though i never use blow dryer . i tried lot different hair-smoothing products , shampoos conditioners leave-in lotions . but this stuff ! it makes my hair sleek silky way no over-the-counter stuff i ever found could . it not goopy or gel-ly or oily like many anti-frizz products . i think it silicone-based , so it just slithers onto your hair then makes it look like ' 70s shampoo commercial . ( if i also use straightening wand special occasions , it looks like " princess hair . " ) my hair also feels 500% softer than it without it . not just subtly softer , if you're paying close attention , but like difference those new kind plush toys extra-silky fur , compared old-fashioned kind stuffed-animal fur . ( i've guys compliment me softness my hair since i started using it . ) this " desert-island " product me ! i shampoo-sized bottle ( not sure exact ounces ) it lasted nearly two years	1
i really lot fun first month i owned it . two aa batteries lasted almost one month . compared other rechargeable models , this one fairly cheap . but after 5 months , now , it so annoying i change batteries every 3 days ! how come toothbrush eats up power so crazy ?! i'm thinking buying rechargeable toothbrush .	-1

i've used lot eyeliners my time . i prefer self-sharpening pencils used loreal , avon , you name it off shelf .. you use what you find like it , you know , until you find something better ... finally ! i found this vital radiance eyeliner one day decided try it . it more expensive than others , but i thot , why not try yet one . other ones seem harder or more waxy or something ... they just don't go smoothly they used . who knows , maybe my eyelids not firm they used ... but that better reason find eyeliner doesn't tug or pull . so even tho other ones say they're " kohl " eyeliners or " glide without tugging pulling " , hasn't case . so i decided try vital radiance one ... wow ... big difference ! i'm very impressed ! i've using these 7 months now , won't ever go back brand . it goes so smooth soft stays all day ... which difference others , they seemed flake off after midday . i sharpen it every 3 days or so , but it still lasts just long other ones . they're just much higher quality eyeliner , worth every extra penny . oh , they're just good anything higher-end you'll find department store . i just hope i keep finding them . hope this helps .	1
this great shaver . it quiet , it holds charge long time . ability wash hair off business end shaver convenient . above all , shave much closer better than expected . i highly recommend this gizmo	1

i really like my new product . i using epilady least 10-15 years old . seems i it forever . it beginning slow down it not cordless . thought it time new one so i ordered it through amazon . com . i really like it also fact it cordless . there no going back razors me . new one seems more gentle than way my old one felt when i used it . can't say enough !! great product	1
i got tired shaving , so i switched waxing year ago hopes my hair would quit growing eventually . my hair grown back finer , but i still hairy legs most time because waxing never removed all hair before my skin gave out , or hair would grow back different rates . so i decided give epilator try . i bought one back 80 it medieval torture device . this new epilady great . it far less painful than waxing . i just feel slight prick rather than giant skin pull . it no worse than plucking eyebrow hair . charge lasts long time . i recently took it ten-day trip it never ran out . next time i won't even take cord . unit isn't very heavy , so it packs well . i am using it once week , i actually enjoy process somewhat . you careful stretch skin taut underarm area . i nicked myself one day soft skin there , but no problems legs . i also make few passes some hairs get them stand up catch , but it hasn't huge problem . i also like how i quick touch-ups my way out door if necessary . i couldn't wax . overall , worth money time	1

very few things make my list favorites but this little item just . this little pain-in-exchange-for-beauty -- convenience device several rows tweezers , which metal parts purple separators . they open up bottom close they come over top while they spin around separate directions , grabbing tweezing out numerous hairs fairly rapidly . it 2 operating speeds , fast or slow . ( 3 only if you consider off speed)i'm shaver , not waxer , i'd estimate my pain threshold average , but i wouldn't so much say it hurts much really stings , even my underarms , which really surprised me because i expecting lot pain when using this , especially my underarms . more hair you given region more you pull out same time naturally hurts more than when there fewer hairs remove . also , it hurts more pull out longer than shorter hairs , i'm not sure why . it definitely helpful stretch surrounding skin taut make hairs stand up little , but they still don't tend come out one pull . it sometimes take up four passes hairs coming up little more each time until they're out . i also noticed it better hurt less thicker , stronger hairs rather than finer ones ; still , i surprised how well it worked hairs seemed like nothing , barely visible first place . initially you may looking significant time investment get point where you're smooth shaved , me it equivalent time i spend entire week shaving spread out over few days . it really odd feeling , going stubbly smooth without actual shave . i got 3 4 times more hair removed than if i shaved , without nicks or cuts , giving me 3 times longer go until i remove those hairs again . six days later i went touch up hard put find anything remove . my legs underarms actually smoother than when shaved stayed way instead getting stubbly within few days , that why this made my list favorite things . now some recommendations : before you use this , let your hair get lightly stubbly but not overgrown state , once you use it you gauge yourself your own best level . you start using this while hair still shorter than when you might normally shave , its best way because even though you use it few days get all hair it cycles through growth stages removing less hair one time means less pain , that especially important when you're first starting out . i would also recommend showering or bathing exfoliating areas you plan remove hair first including washing off deodorant underarms but make sure your skin not wet or damp when you start because damp or wet skin more pliable means pinching pain during use . i seen models cordless state they used wet but i can't imagine why you'd want since it bound hurt . i've run this thing long periods time ( up 45 minutes ) but never problem jamming , probably because i clean exfoliate my skin first clean unit out after each use . first few times you use this your skin may become irritated bumpy , so i would not get this use immediately before big event or trip , i would want give myself minimum 2 4 weeks get used it , especially since you may decide you don't like it . it takes some time get as-smooth-as-shaved condition , so i would plan using it over course few days reduce irritation give some time hairs cycle through their growth stages become long enough remove .	1
i tried heating cap gold ' hot . many complained gold ' hot not get hot all . i agree . mastex professional heat cap get hot right away . i love it	1
i love this fragrance . world around me too . ask all females i mack ..	1
i bought this cologne based many many favorable reviews . i over 20 major brand colognes this one my favorites . it almost identical acqua di gio except it kept check aspects di gio i didn't care . it just tad less sweet , perhaps addition grapefruit top notes gives it more sophisticated distinction di gio . there no unpleasant tones this cologne it seems last while . bottle stylish very tall compared all my other ones , but box pretty plain . it not quite casual hugo would work well when you must make good impression . it doesn't appear overdone popular some others , so you still mark your territory , perhaps because it bit pricey	1

initally i tried gerber pads , yikes ! leaking through , too thin , but they not too visable through my tops . avent pads not leak they very thick , sadly they really showed through my clothes . i read reviews this product bought box , , . they individually wrapped , which allows them go into your purse without getting covered fluff sticky candy , plus little sticky pad back hold it place .

satin finish design very attractive . i pump each chamber 100 times get it primed but after it worked great . you might want prime it water instead shampoo get things going . directions , which i lost , said something priming . installation easy . it includes both glue or 4 short adhesive strips . i went adhesive strips it seems secure . i figured if i ever remove it , i could just pull it off use goof off remove adhesive . if you fill one chambers body soap , i recommend neutrogena rainbath refreshing shower bath gel , original formula natural sponge . i bought synthetic sponge looks like natural one wal-mart it little rough	1
cheap junk . we got this sale plus $10 off combined purchase so we paid very little , but even too much . it made so cheaply it falling apart inside package . this dollar store item , even then we would not recommend purchase . copper too soft , so you can't get any pressure . if you try use it , it bends arc , so you use it one second then you fix it use it again second . wood handle cracks slivers , metal ring base comes right off needs glued . sadly more thought went into package then product . pictures may worth 100 words , however item not worth dollar . avoid all cost . we would return it , but amazon charges us more return it then we paid product . however it may work whisk .	-1

heel smoother just okay job . i disappointed	-1
i bought this advice friend who tried it loved it . i little reluctant after reading some other reviews , but my friend neighbor , cheryl , swore it . she bought similar product few months ago really disappointed it - so when she tried this one said it wonderful , i went ahead ordered it based solely her recommendation . i am so particular my feet i even trim my own nails before i get pedicure ! i only pedicure get dead skin off my feet , them smoothed enjoy experience . ( i live desert i wear sandals most time . ) so i would say i'm pretty tough cookie please . i got my heel smoother yesterday couldn't wait try it . it perfect ! fact i just called cheryl thank her turning me it . i love it so much i think i'm going get them my mom my sister holidays . i usually pay $28 - $40 pedicure - so after just one use , this paid itself i'm ahead game ! it took off all dead skin it didn't hurt all . unit powerful enough without scary ( when i tried dremel tool few years ago - disaster ! ) it actually easy access my heels this instrument ... i like way it shaped it lightweight . i really surprised how efficient it . cream comes it great , too . i put it before bed could really feel difference this morning . i sold cosmetics 25 years ago i know keeper when i see one . this awesome . i could sold ton these if they around back then . i believe expression " if you like what we , tell friend .... if you don't like what we , tell us . " i live - believing business owner , we would want know if something wasn't good . consequently , i always say when something isn't great , ( particularly food or service restaurant - since i wrote book business lunches ! ) so i also feel need share my opinion when i find something really super what it says it . i wholeheartedly recommend this . if you want your heels look feel nice , smooth keep them cracking , polish them down this fabulous instrument . then polish your toenails slip into your sandals confidence . i wish more women ( men ) would take better care their feet ... what i've seen , this heel smoother should mandatory	1
i tried many different types joint support formulas found them somewhat lacking their effect . after doing much homework research , joint vibrance offered exactly ingredients i would put my own formula . tried it within days , chronic inflammatory tendonitis joint pain diminished . great stuff	-1
i've it month now i say this great electric shaver ! i sensitive skin , but didn't any kind " break " period when i started using it . i owned electric shaver 10 years ago experienced two or three week period skin irritation . not so this one . fact , my face cleared up since i started using it . i used shave every other day my mach 3 razor avoid skin irritation . i not only shave every day now my braun , but i also shave again evening if i date . charge right what others mentioned . you get good 40 50 minutes shave time it . it shaves very close . my skin never smoother i don't put shaving cream or anything else my skin prepare it shaving . all you need dry skin your shaver . it take little extra effort my neck , but i've adapted over past month . i just shave it different angles , pull my skin tight , apply bit pressure . again , it very close shave . least good if not better than my mach 3 . also , like other reviews , i'm still trying figure out what braun thinking when they designed travel case . where am i supposed put my electric cord ? poor design travel case my only complaint this shaver . it very easy clean . don't spend extra money shaver cleaning solution you purchase again again . little practice , i've reduced time required clean my razor under minute . all you need hot water ! i remove foil cutting block clean them after every shave . i then leave parts counter next sink air dry . this great shaver i strongly recommend everyone who still uses blades	1
pretty inexpensive effecitve . takes few shaves get hang it . i never skin irritation again	1
shaver works fine , but name " rechargeable " bit misleading . it " rechargeable " replacing batteries , sense , every device relies battery power " rerchargeable " . this small stand-alone shaver , easy pack , convenient reliable . i use it standard shaver i don't shave while taking shower	-1
i love my little razor , but based upon amazon description ( not manufacturer description ) i felt i ordered razor rechargable batteries . unfortunately , device requires you go buy replacements lithium batteries every couple months . this direct conflict what amazon " chris " product reviewer says page . despite extra expense you'll buying replacement lithium batteries ( not cheap ! ) , it great shaver . i coarse beard i get very clean shave out this guy , it packs easily travel . very well made	-1
i shave once every two days decided try m3 power nitro ( black ) . it attracted my attention innovative idea combining regular razor electro-vibration , thus making hybrid . i'm not impressed it all ! i don't like it several reasons . vibration actually mostly reflected handle so i felt uncomfortable because it making my hand too shaky i'm 26 years old not drinker ! it doesn't cause cuts or burns but it felt really annoying my hand while shaving even few minutes later ! due better lubricator-strip it glides better , softer than regular mach3 but shaving performance same . handle grip ok but bit worse than regular mach3 because it doesn't fully rubberized handle bottom . it used mach3 cartridges , i tested shaved . while shaving i concerned not getting wet its battery compartment . i would rather use it regular mach3 razor , vibration turned off , but would not buy ! why pay more " fancy " but fact useless/annoying vibration function if regular mach3 practically same , if not better , job ?!	-1
my husband purchased this heating pad me . i neck problems needed new heating pad . first its takes forever warm up then it would shut off no reason . after two weeks , it would not turn any longer . this worst heating pad i ever used ......	-1
century ii good alternative century series which i consider too small my hands . black finish more comfortable than metal finishes	1
this replacement one just died . i my first one several years loved it . only problem you can't replace rechargeable battery when it dies . i guess keep toothbrush waterproof toothbrush sealed . i got manual toothbrush while then just sonicare back . i bought this one instead newer model , because i felt i didn't need extra bells whistles . basic model works excellently	1
whether you get basic model , or elite , nothing else works better . this my second model , battery finally quite old model after 5 or 6 years .	1
i bought this item ross 6.99 ... i wanted it before found it cheaper there . i love it . first it seemed kind small but i amazed how much i could fit it . it keeps food nice cold i no trouble ice ring or lid .. i highly reccommend it	1
i'm giving it 4 stars because , though not perfect , it good job money . re-arranging rocksyou vary amount splashy sounds . downside because ark-shaped bottom there willbe corresponding amount outside splashing . so you'll want use tray and/or absorbent mat . also , thereis slight motor hum but sounds water pretty much override it . ultimately , it help me relax	-1
i used homedics rock garden foutain but i didn't like too much because water would get everywhere . this garden leaves foutain , there no splash all . it uses same pump rock garden foutain it not really super noisy . rocks provided like rock bits though	1

these items neat little towelettes their own handy little plastic container , come extra refill package . they very handy , work wonders insuring cleanliness . personally , i now consider them necessary part my toiletries ! down side , flushing these things * * result plumbing problems , i experienced . apparently , if your sewer line relatively new clear , they should give you no problems . but , if your system any place it where things collect , you face problems . according plumber , toilet paper begins break down quite quickly , but these towelettes take over month so . so , overall , i like this product , i recommend it . i just recommend if you live older house , you not flush them	-1
i work health so i recomend this product my patients . you use it before baby birth prepare nipples feeding , after birth protect nipples . there no cream like it , pure non toxic your baby when nursing . works almost immediately when your nipple hurts . you use it all times you want during day without washing or cleaning before feeding your baby . great product !!	1
these pull ups work great my skinny boy-hipped two year old daughter . they never leaked night they don't leave red marks . even size 4 they fit pretty snug so i wouldn't recommend them child " baby fat " like my older one . i use other ones pulled apart sides it comfortable fit . can't think name them , they may huggies , but they too big my two year old . hopefully these thing past soon . wish us luck potty training	1
ever since my daughter starts wear these , she refuse wear her usual pampers cruiser or huggies supreme . easy ups absorbs well . they look feel very comfortable . i love easy side-tear feature - perfect poo-poo clean up	1

i decided buy this heating pad strength number good reviews , although i noticed there some people saying they felt pad highest setting didn't produce enough heat , others said it " really hot . " anyway , my pad certainly doesn't get nearly hot i'd expect it . it very disappointing , actually . i don't know if it defect , or if there variations individual items this regard , but it hard me imagine how anyone could possibly say my pad gets " really hot . " i'd describe it more " luke-warm " -- that highest setting	-1
i several these sunbeam soft heating pads . i already used this new one high setting pretty hot , thus i am using 3 4 heat setting . i like new fancy control too . i like i put it 2 hour setting or continuous setting too . i am hopeful they " bugs " worked out control system it usually what goes bad ... i am going hold my receipts packaging just case this one goes bad too . i tried other brands this same type heating pad control them goes bad too . probably all made same company .	1
i through many trimmers many different brands . i used enjoy norelco trimmers but since they moved production china their entire product line going downhill . after few bad decisions i finally came this wahl . it right choice . it trims well efficiently many included combs . build quality very solid . it also one last wahl products made usa . only qualm i it not able accept worldwide voltage . my old norelco austria this feature but their new products single voltage too . oh well . over all this trimmer highly recommended	1
i user straight razors , then battery operated shavers which not give me efficient shave day they irritated my skin badly . when mach 3 came out i tried-it i'll damned it worked good , it kept my 5 ' o'clock gone 2-days . when gillette came out mach 3 turbo it revolutionized shaving it soothed my skin each pass vitamin . but i think next time i'll buy m3 power , it better cartridge ( one came m3 turbo cartridge box promo ) . i may also try fusion but wait until they drop price they too expensive . til ' then i'll stick m3 turbo power	1
this only blade i'm allowed buy my husband . he normally shave least twice daily but these blades allow him go all day without second shave . they don't tear up his face process either , but get it so close he doesn't worry rushing home shave again . truly great product well worth price . it great ladies too	1

this chair like high-tech cocoon massage , it amazing . first , looks : good leather , deep black , overall chair looks like it high quality , like you paid $3k it . construction seems quite solid . chair take up good bit space , perhaps 4 feet wide full extension 6.5 feet long . function : control panel pretty extensive , sort quick massage functions swedish etc , well controls picking out specific areas focus . so you go pre-built massages or use customization create one spot what you need ( save it ) . customizing massage takes probably 20 minutes tinkering figure out , so not totally easy but certainly not hard either . only negative i see it chair clearly designed people under 6 feet tall . i am 5'10 just barely get my legs fully extended chair , so it works but would not if i 6 ' . so seriously , don't get this if you tall , it just frustrating . overall chair well worth it us , chair purchased ease back pains after giving birth carrying around baby months , quite well .	1

but i love this cologne . it hard review something like this considering it all smells different different people , but black code nice , mellow scent isn't overpowering or distracting all . i get so many compliments when i wear this out . i'd compare it preferred stock , but less potent . black code little more than i'd normally spend something like this , but it worth it ! while no cologne guarantee someone tear off whatever clothes you're wearing just your scent , this one definitely inspires compliments people !	1

yes , it works . like many other people , i switched hairtopia when h37 nothing me . you'll first notice change your nails . heck , it even something my eyebrows . hair growth i noticed within three weeks ( not bad ! ) but careful when taking vitamin mineral capsules ; they niacinamide them , this cause your ears burn blood red your whole face neck heat up like oven . i learned later , after night panic cold shower , this called niacin flush , which last 30 min hour . believe me , it feels like hot hell , but it actually healthy you . just ready it , never ever take these pills empty stomach !	1
this my 3rd braun within last 10 years . i tried other brands , but they just don't measure up . braun gives me closest most comfortable shave ever . also , cleaning/recharging system works very well	1
funny , i read some reviews here , wonder people who reviewing product . * i own different razor , but am reviewing this one ... * you can't get it wet , but it doesn't say product manual ... * you replace " expensive " cutter/head every 18 months ... * cleaning stand too large ... good grief , this stuff made up ? it cannot real , it ? " here your sign ... " any these people any research before purchase ? you see this thing any wal-mart or target america .... i think these people who sue companies ' hot coffee ' .... sheesh . come , folks , it razor ! i used norelco wet/dry years , never quite satisfied . too many passes , razor burn bad . so , after dropping it floor breaking it beyond repair , i tried this . rebate amazon , it less than franklin bill purchase shipped ! razor great ! almost close blade . after 6 years navy , where i learned hate shaving _every day_ , i am finally doing it again , no problems . there no ' tug ' like lift cut norelco , i get less ingrown hairs , continuous problem lift cut system . ' hum ' braun different than ' whirr ' norelco , but no louder or more annoying . cleaning stand great . i clean all whiskers my razor brush before putting it stand , then remove cleaning fluid after cleaning slow evaporation . i easily get two months , perhaps 3 cleaning cartridge , 6 days week shaving ( i skip saturdays ) . after trip , deep clean makes this razor sparkling new ! long run , disposable razor , or even mach 3 replacable blade , cost 50 cents day . ( including shaving cream , hot water , etc . ) heck , say 20 cents day . after year , 20 cents day adds up $70 ... i got this convenient razor ( i use it car , my desk , bathroom , etc . ) just few dollars more than . even after replacing cutters 18 months , i come out ahead $$$ . no-brainer . electric razors environmentally friendlier than disposable razors , cost effective , just close blade newest technology . yourself favor ... get into 21st century , buy this razor , or buy norelco , but give up bic , cheapskate !	1

aqua-jet foot spa some great qualties . such rotatable aqua jets , which work really well . they only two front where your toes though . i wish they something else back . overall spa what it says but massage nodes help relieve stress hard too feel when you roll your feet over them . it kinda struggle i friend try it she said same . heater work well long you put luke warm water start . if your looking relaxing foot treatment practically knocks you out relaxation , this it . it may just little too pricy	-1
my wife wanted foot spa i began my search via web noticed most people weren't pleased their foot spas they complained loud noises , jets ( i.e. bubbles ) not powerful , or just plain cheap . i decided give sharper image or brookstone try . sharper image claimed their spa kept water warm but out stock ( good sign ) but i wanted one immediately gave brookstone try . my wife loved it ! she frequents nail salons pedicures stated this machine just like ones salon regards features comfort . she very thankful . i also experienced jets water temperature it works advertised . you won't dissatisfied . there cheaper ones but imho this worth money . enjoy .	1
i've this dispenser my master shower almost 8 years all bottles deliver liquids like when they new . only problem i've deterioration over time fog-free mirrors . however you order replacement under $7 ( plus shipping ) . i'm process replacing my second mirror , so they lasted average four years . not bad !	1

aquis hair turban very quickly dries medium length hair just right amount leave it damp enough styling . i found i prefer using this rather than aquis towels my hair , they tend leave it too dry my needs . towels great drying off drying wash wear hair styles , but hair turban much better if you need your hair damp enough set , blow out , or otherwise work .	1
i love this turban . i used one every day last 7-8 years it stayed great shape . unfortunately , i accidentally left it hotel , so now i'm ordering 2 more . turban holds hair securely dries it well , compact ( takes almost no space luggage -- convenient frequent travelers )	1
i worried reading lack steam reviewer but most reviewers seemed happy it , so i bought it . using plain tap water ( our maryland water hard ) , inhaler made strong , gentle , steady steam less than 45 seconds . steam lasted 9 minutes before it decreased . i would like steam last longer but it trying breath fast deeply i could , i almost hyperventilating 9 minutes . unit cool down before you add more water you warned not over-fill unit . mask made soft , flexible plastic so it comfortable . i found it easiest just hold unit my face , since resting it tissue box caused me bend down . you probably need extension cord , since cord not very long ( if you using wall outlet ) although if you using higher bathroom outlet , it would fine . it very easy fill - open white top , unscrew lid , add measured water , put back together , turn . only little complaint you should disassemble pieces let them dry , so i leave unit pieces towel dry day . i always hated using old fashioned method putting my head over boiling water towel breath steam . this much nicer my face didn't get hot or feel burned . i found this inhaler comfortable convenient . i cold using this unit three or four times , i didn't get sinus infection i think it helped cold less severe go away faster . i also rinse my sinuses neti pot baking soda/salt solution very warm water . i used neti pot before still got sinus infection but this time using steam inhaler , i didn't . people sinus problems , allergies , or prone cold , i think using neti pot rinse your sinuses very helpful . i read it " sinus survival " book my good friend said she hasn't sinus infection years since she started using neti pot every day . i only use neti pot when there lot pollen , after yard work , lots people ( especially sick ones ) , when i stuffy nose or feel " something " coming	1

i thought this scale good while . it looked good . then i started getting odd readings . within five minutes , it would give me two different weights either 4 or 5 lbs apart . ( i would it over over scale seemed not able decide ) . i tried new battery , it not help . ( before i noticed this problem , i actually told friend get this scale , too , she reported same problem ) . i've tried moving scale , resetting it , everthing . nothing seems help . i am now shopping new scale	-1

i my air-o-swiss 2 winters now . i live north east winters very dry . we only tend turn humidifier during winter times so far humidifier working good new . i not problems white powder some reviewers mentioned i change demineralization cartridge every winter . cleaning breeze i think it helps fact i use purified water refills . not sure if this recommended but i not see any lime sclae build up result . already mentione dby others , humidity level indicator not accurate result , i went out invested small amount money get seperate indicator . i found hygrometer $5 sears i tend go reading rather than built one . i think price costly but fair . you get what you paid . quiet , nice looking humidifier easy clean maintain	1
after using several other humidifiers , most which lasted only few months before breaking , i decided bite bullet try expensive one . after considerable research , i chose air-o-swiss . so far ( two months ) it seems well worth its high price . it far easiest live any console or tabletop humidifier i've owned . it performed beautifully my modest 15 ' 15 ' bedroom . no problems over or under humidification . no white dust ( so far , least ) . no more morning sore throat , dried out nasal passages or hacking cough , either . further , it blessedly quiet . admittedly , my others not ultrasonic devices , so i can't compare other machines using same technology , but compared standard evaporative units this silent delight . tank large enough it needs filled only once or twice day ( except during extremely cold weather ) . filling it presents no more difficulty than any other unit i've owned . i like easy use , well designed automatic mode , well option warm or cool mist . i use warm while i'm sleeping , cool reduce operating costs when i'm not room . ( it 24/7 because i'm home all day . ) downside , it expensive buy maintain ( filter cartridge refills sticks overpriced , but they work well ) . high maintenance cost reason 4 rather than 5 stars . addition , it occasionally slightly moisten rug nearby , although not consistently never enough soak through ( instructions warn against using it floor , so i knew i doing so my own risk ) . tank removal replacement process inevitably results few drops dripping floor , too . no leakage problem , however . overall , though , air-o-swiss great upgrade virtues greatly outweighing its minor imperfections	-1
after countless nights interupted sleep , i now wake refreshed . other reviews helped me choose this product . i chose 7135 model over 7133 added features , am glad i . sleep mode great . i am light sleeper , but this unit extremely quiet . resevoir need filled each day , but one reasons i purchased portable unit addition my whole house humidifier --- adding extra moisture my bedroom . it simply too dry . my husband , buzz saw , snores much less now lot quieter since purchasing air-o-swiss . thanks all who gave this unit 5 stars . it made my decision easy	1

30 seconds into my first shave , i knew i made great choice my new razor . now , three weeks later , i'm even more elated than i during first shave . after using braun shavers my last two , this panasonic revalation . i researched new shavers couple hours , narrowed it down this panasonic comparable ( comparably expensive ) braun system . perhaps latest braun would made me happy , too , but i won't switching back . what i like es8162 ? starters , blades move consistent speed , which higher than my old braun . blades maintain speed , even when shaver battery low , something plagued my old braun , which end i keep plugged 100% time . consistently high speed panasonic means less razor burn , least my face . other thing i love able shave wet or dry . i thought this " nice " but i quickly become addicted shaving wet , my geo . trumper shaving soap real badger brush . talk crazy combination retro modern ! but glycerin-based shaving soap feels so much better my face , leaves it smooth clean , perfect lubricant shaving panasonic . shaving brush pure indulgence . i used hate shaving . i wouldn't say i look forward it now , but it certainly become experience its own modest pleasure	1
i like these rollers because they little teeth them holds hair so they won't slip out . it take them while heat-up , but i usually plug them ahead time , so it doesn't really matter me . clips easy use keep rollers place . i've tried rollers covered velvet material , but they just didn't hold hair place . these my favorite so far . my only complaint i wish extra rollers clips sold stores , but you order them directly conair	-1

i've never used at-home microdermabrasion kit before so i can't really compare it others ( yet ) , but after my first try 2 weeks ago i loved it . my face felt baby soft like never before . i couldn't stop touching my face 2 days shocked everytime how great it felt . but after 2nd day using it ( i it 5 days row because i don't sensitive skin ) , it didn't feel great ( but i didn't break out or anything ) . i finished up 5 days while my skin feel softer than it before i started this , it wasn't silky smooth it after my very first use . i notice my blackheads visibly reduced -- even tough ones my chin . first time i used it , i just rinsed my face went sleep . i didn't use any lotion because i oily skin residue microdermabrasion cream left my face not dry . second day , i used my blemish extractor sephora blackheads came out very well cleansed murad pomegranate face wash/toner . fyi - if anyone extractor , i find " whitehead " loop works better extracting blackheads than flat blackhead loop ( which scrapes irritates my skin ) . anyway , it 2 weeks i've lazy try it again my skin back square one . i'm not sure if i'll start over 5 days row thing again or just it 2 or 3 times week " maintenance . " i'm thinking ( if i time ) doing microd , extract , then clay mask or peel . sorry write novel , but last note i just want say even if effects aren't long term , it sure felt great skin teenager again ( if only 2 days) ! if anything , it best exfoliator i've ever used ... even better than aspirin mask , imo . i would definitely buy this product again , but i think i'll try other brands first see which one best . first time , though , this great experience	1

believe it or not , this product beats proactiv big time . i didn't think it would since proactiv so popular nowadays . i bought proactiv while back it not pleasant experience . my skin burned , itched , turned red . top all , it abnormally dry [ shocking because i've never dry skin my life ] . i desperately needed something get rid my acne [ which located mostly my forhead area ] ... proactiv terrible , i mentioned before . so i decided buy neutrogena advanced solutions , this best decision ever . i noticed results soon 2-3 days . my acne all gone now . this great product . since i don't enough time my schedule , this product great . it only 2 steps , whereas proactiv 3 . my skin great right now , i love it !! i totally recommend this product . you may wondering why i'm giving this 4 stars , reason because it cause bit dry skin , but it not severe , it went away itself . overall , i'm satisfied	-1

first off , i'm actually my 20 but i'm lazy set up account right now . anyway , i picked up this kit walgreens other day . it marked down $20 $15 so i thought i'd give it shot . high prices whats always kept me trying other teeth whitening products , but i decided i could handle $15 . my teeth weren't too bad , but they little yellow especially my lower teeth gum line . gel doesn't taste good , but i didn't expect it . nothing dentist ever puts my mouth tastes good , so i didn't expect this any different . however , it doesn't taste awful . i didn't tooth or gum sensitivity till last round but it tolerable . i noticed pretty big difference my teeth ... my top teeth almost pearly white while my bottom teeth now one uniform color , instead yellower gum line . i pretty happy results spending $15 only taking 2 hours . i some bad gum pain following day however . it only bad one day , but discomfort didn't go away completely probably 3 whole days . however i don't think i washed gel thoroughly enough space my gums my lower lip since only place i pain , so my fault .	-1
i like shave shower tried linear foil we t-t o-dry shavers ( braun panasonic ) . this first rotary shaver i've owned it pretty good . nothing like blade , but i believe this product shaves faster than braun panasonic more thorough . if you can't closeness blade , least go fastest shaver . don't believe hype - none them shave " close blade " . p.s. built lubricating lotion plus when you don't want pack shaving cream those weekend trips - it trick .	-1
this shaver terrific provides close shave- but doesn't leave your skin raw or irritated if used shower shaving cream . i used wet/dry shaver over 10 years , panasonic foil ( which cut my face)to remingtom ( no longer available ) norelco ( best ) . i shave shower shaving cream never use it dry . using it wet shaver , i no longer trouble shaving my neck , or shaving when it hot or humid . i no longer breakout irritation no longer raw neck . i also find rotary superior foil my facial hair , this shaver meets my needs . i highly recommend this shaver anyone who uses shaver instead blades recommend anyone even least trouble using dry shaver try this wet shaver	1
this shaver performs extremely well . shaves close razor , full charge lasts entire month , longer if you dont shave every day . instructions absolutely correct , it takes few weeks get used it , so dont too put off if your first couple shaves uncomfortable . if you more sensitive skin , i would stongly recommend using minimal pressure first , even if means not getting closest shave . once your skin adjusts , you still get shaver burn if you press too hard , especially neck , so resist any urge grind shaver into your beard . despite providing incredibly close shave , it sometimes fails grab every hair first couple passes its little tricky maneuvering around strong adams apple . after taking those shortcomings into account , its still superior every way other shavers ive used : top model braun foil shaver , couple cheaper norelco models . while doesnt qualify me authority shavers , i appreciate when product basically lives up expectations . even though 9160 isnt quite perfect , it comes through reasonably fast , close comfortable shave . here few tips should help , especially when starting out : 1 ) shave before you shower . shaver works better stiffer beard your face less sensitive . 2 ) shave every day if you . longer your beard , more hair gets missed . 3 ) if any hairs get missed after couple passes , leave them . its not worth getting every hair exchange shaver burn . you get more experienced shaver , youll get better using it . touch up rogue whiskers sideburn trimmer . 4 ) this shaver trouble longer hairs lie flat . if you spot any after your first pass , use sideburn trimmer shorten them before touching up rotary blades . if youve already made couple passes before you notice them , refer back tip #3 . 5 ) keep tension setting normal . if you set it sensitive , you just press harder make more passes get good shave . 6 ) if you still trouble shaver burn , use little apple cider vinegar aftershave . yes , it feel like your face ripped off couple seconds . if youre not fan sensation , you may dilute it . let it dry completely , then rinse it off . its best solution ive tried minimizing razor bumps , ive tried them all	-1

i've eaten virtually every protein bar meal replacement bar market . when you factor taste , nutritional content price here amazon.com verses others peanut butter met-rx bars bes t.t he met-rx peanut butter cookie dough 27 grams protein , 51gm carbs , 2gm fiber , 35% 45% usrda 17 vitamins minerals . nutritional description incorrect because it gives zeros across board everything which isn't true . it best tasting while perhaps least junk food tasting bars there . reviewer stated they tasted like junk food . these perhaps least junk food tasting all market ( i've tasted virtally all them ) . peanut butter cookie dough met-rx big 100 bars bio protein chocolate peanut butter bars best tasting non-candy / least candy junk food tasting meal replacent bars there ( if you order other flavors bars i just mentioned -- they tast more like junk food ) . bars peanut butter best flavor all flavors offered . i've ordered these bars several times gensoy bars other items vitamin shoppe . they ship cross country north bergen , new jersey los angeles , ca i always receive product within 8 days or less day i ordered it .

after regaining most weight i lost doing atkins diet ( gain due medication facial/jaw injury ) , i pretty upset . i didn't really want atkins again because high fat low fiber content read some pretty scary things atkins i wanted lose weight again , but more healthy fashion . i heard hoodia product bought some back-up my new lower carb , low fat high fiber diet . what i've read , i'm doing " south beachie " sort diet . my weight loss much slower , but i feel much better . thing i've noticed since i started using hoodia product , i don't desire induldge " neurotic nibbling " which bug-a-boo mine years . i really don't want eat much . i only eat enough . i think hoodia responsible my changed eating habits . weight stats : 69 " tallbefore atkins 170 - 175after atkins : 145 - 150after jaw/facial injury meds : 163 - 165i'm now hovering around 158 pounds . i think hoodia helping	-1
this my first time trying hoodia gordonii . i am bulimic desperate something curb my nightly binging . i bit skeptical first because mixed reviews overwhelmed number different brands claiming only " true pure brand . " i went dex-l10 because i didn't want one too weak or too strong first . first time i tried it during mid-afternoon no desire eat rest evening . 500mgs seemed work fine me but i small frame am normal weight , if i feel i need it stronger i always take two . i understand if you're overweight it might take much higher dose get same effects . what i've read , some people need 1000 mgs 3 times day others could get 400mg still lose weight . i think this good brand because there no other ingredients so you get full effect figure out how much works right you . effects kinda subtle . i still eat food while taking it but i am not constantly thinking food every five minutes like i used . i also try eat very healthy exercise begin , most important thing , so i would only recommend hoodia someone who needs extra push stop eating obsessively . it not " weight loss " pill per se , but one could lose weight it realistically . it only appetite supressant which why too many people disappointed when they don't lose weight . emotional eaters known eat even when they not hungry . it works , but don't expect it magic cure everyone .	-1
i tried hoodia gordonii must admit i am not hungry . i so far lost 10 lbs , it so easy . if you looking appetite suppressant this item works highly recommended ............. june 30th i lost total 25 lbs ......... keeping mind hoodia not work itself , rather you must eat healthier but if you snacker like me , it great	1

i bought this air bed january i decided not write review until i used it some time . i sleeping it every night since i bought it . it almost half year i still love it . this air bed very comfortable durable . i only pumped air few times past six months . important thing remember when you use any air bed air bed not iron bed . air bed like balloon , but much different shape . if you know how not make balloon burst , you should same your air bed though air beds more durable . before you pump up bed , you've got vacume your floor make sure there no hard sharp particles which may prick your air bed cause leaks . this very important extending life your air bed . i always take off my shoes door when i come into my house . so i less chance bringing sand , dust , dirt so into my house . result , my floor clean . still , i vacume it every now then maintain it . if you wear your shoes your house , you should always make sure floor space under your air bed clean free sharp or hard particles any kind . they may so small you can't notice , but vacuming floor very helpful prevent your air bed damaged	1

after lot searching , i finally found product i wanting . brush holds many layers my shoulder-length hair , larger diameter , it results soft curls curves . it heats up quickly , plus it plastic cap end so i don't burn my fingers . i highly recommend this hot brush those longer hair don't want tight curls .	1
i love this curling brush . it heats up super quickly , so many settings turbo heat button extra shot heat hard curl areas . i use it morning straighten out kinks sleeping , straighten smooth my hair , flip it under or out , or add some waves . it nice long cord , too . i think brush less damaging than curling iron because there no clamp you don't hold it same place long . if you haven't tried brush , this one try . note this brush heats up , not brush blows hot air - it use dry hair only .	1

our mattress only 5 years old , but last year , my husband i haven't sleeping well our bodies aching every morning . when we received this mattress pad early christmas gift , we thrilled ! once he got it unpacked laid flat , it took very little time fluff up . i slept better very first night when i wake morning , i'm not stiff sore all over . it made huge difference just last week . i concerned it wouldn't fit under our sheets , but we've no problems either . it simply squishes down corners us fit sheets over it . i would highly recommend it anyone	1
i disapointed performance this poduct . it absolutely not provide 100% lift . 75-80% . also seat small one built up 300 lbs . lets face it , if your near 250lbs up , your bottom much larger than seat resulting , hanging over edges . it very uncomfortable any extended period time . seat hard not padded well . also , " recliner " type chairs it says it work , not totally true . levers opperate seat either side , but if you sit lift recliner chair " sinking factor " hinders use leavers , makes it difficult reach them . we found it very frustrating extremely disapointed ! this not worth $ our oppinion . it would huge improvement widen seat , add more padding corded seperate remote instead leavers seat itself	-1

i've never tried any other brands pre-electric shave conditioner , but i so displeased my new electric shaver i decided give afta try ; i chose " fresh " scent . ( it kind silly name , since " afta " makes you think " after , " you're supposed use it " before " ! )afta given me dramatically closer shave , one more comfortable , too . it made difference unacceptable shave acceptable one . bottle says , it non-greasy formula . it doesn't appear clog razor heads , also claimed . i've only using it three weeks , so it may too early tell . only drawback , which i consider minor , fragrance rather strong . it reminds me inexpensive after shave lotion . it doesn't dissipate my post-shave rinse water ; you would probably need wash soap water make it completely go away . however , i'm so pleased improvement quality my shave lingering aroma doesn't bother me least	1

when you buy this product , you certain your expectations properly set . it not vacuum cleaner won't pull dirt out carpet . it isn't even traditional carpet sweeper rotating brushes lift hair surface dirt into chamber emptying . what carpet flick good picking up surface dirt litter . it no moving parts , so it depends ( 1 ) rolling over litter sticks up above surface carpet , or ( 2 ) litter light enough so small internal " breeze " moving unit back forth causes enough flick dirt into upper container . i used this unit extensively since i purchased it . i truthfully say it wonderful job cleaning up tremendous amount environmental " stuff . " compared small casabella brand carpet sweeper which i used before i bought this product , carpet flick much better job . i am very happy product , even though i recognize it not ever replace good vacuum clearner ( or even well-built , full-sized carpet sweeper ) . so keep your eyes open your expectations calibrated when you hit " buy " button this product	-1

i owned these clippers nearly year . they cut just precisely now they when i bought them new . wide blade very nice requires less strokes . i use these clippers once week clean up my fade/blowout . they cut really thin , thin barbers , only they not cut razor thin . i yet see anything cut razor thin besides razor . these clippers closest you get barber chair your home . i am so sold quality this brand/line i just purchased " improved master clippers " accompany my " t-outliner " . it set me back hundred bucks but if it all like t-outliner than i extremely happy . you get what you pay oh yes , don't forget keep them oiled !	1
dryer very quiet powerful . easy install . night light nice green glow . highly recommend this product	1
my wife i very satisfied dryer so far . each us uses it every day . it isn't quiet we hoped , but it still fairly quite . more importantly - it works fine main thing . couple points . note 1 : night light pretty powerful stays all time , night or day . not big deal us . note 2 : installing it bit hassle , especially if you not screwdriver magnetic tip , you thread each 2 screws through two mounting brackets , screws kept falling out . i finally gave up one screw , but dryer still secure wall . note 3 : this dryer replacement wall-mounted unit just died less than 2 years . we this one 3 months - so verdict still out its lifespan ..	-1

i oily scalp but lots dandruff . nizoral really removes dandruff without drying scalp or hair . smell relatively pleasant ( scent little bit medicinal side , but it not offensive all ) . it stops itch almost instantly , when used regularly , it keeps off dandruff . despite high price , it definitely worth purchase . i tried many other anti-itch dandruff shampoo , but they either dry scalp too much ( e.g. head shoulders ) , or they smell offensive ( coal tar products ) . smell coal tar products remind me flea shampoo i used wash my dog ! all all , i would given nizoral 10 stars if i could . i would highly recommend this product .	1

calvin klein escape women bit more " perfume-y " than what i usually wear , but i like it occasional alternative fragance . it powerful scent whose richness gives it almost masculine quality , yet it not all musky . rather , it slight woodsy note me , i find it more fruity than floral . fairly strong scent , it also very good staying power . finally , i don't find this fragrance particularly sensual or sexy , so it works well business wear , although it not something i would wear every day . overall , likeable scent i would rate 3.5 -4 stars	-1

i love this drink . it bit acquired taste -- i found it little bit chalky , but i love it now . it full essential nutrients , so it completely worth cost . chocolate flavor far best my humble opinion . i usually combine cup ( it comes its own measuring cup ) cup skim milk blend it . mixing it together without blender causes it clump something awful , so blender definitely essential . i recommend pouring how much milk you intend drink your designated drinking vessel first before you blend ; shake tendency froth this way you don't end up excess sitting blender . generally i've found days i time drink this shake ( washing blender morning prove bit much ) i more energy just feel ... healthier . you really can't go wrong this drink . i found drinking this meal replacement aid very helpful weight loss	1

i don't normally bother writing reviews unless i really love something or really hate it . mistique air therapy fountain mister exceeded my expectations . i'm astonished negative review below only wonder if reviewer i talking same item . so glad i didn't let him/her put me off buying one these . what good this fountain : mister came mostly assembled , so assembly part no problem ; i afraid changing colours going look bit cheesy , but fact they quite beautiful watch ; i mist adjuster set high ( it sort-of flap , i it pushed all way up ) experienced no puddles water ; fountain makes pleasant swirly mist , sort like dry ice ; it gives off very soft gentle-spring-rain sound ; it lot easier clean than traditional tabletop fountains ; it nice , sleek , modern design ; mister shuts off if water level goes below what recommended ; it doesn't require frequent refills - once day lasts while ; it specifically states tap water only used - no go shops distilled or other water . i haven't yet tried pearlessence oils , but i used body shop home fragrance oils they work really well . six drops directly water gives off pleasant scent within six-foot radius , but after while scent permeates lot farther . so , turn mister , put your favourite scent , pour your preferred beverage , put some soothing music , turn down lights . if this doesn't relax you , you need professional help . february 22 , 2007 : this follow-up my earlier review . i just received additional misters work gifts . they changed design , so my comments adjustable mister flap no longer valid , because it isn't there any more . it now comes small glass disk i think place keep water spraying all over . you'll still need put mister plate or tray , but it , i think , avoid possibility getting large puddles water underneath . also , inner parts now unassembled , but so simple put together , you'd completely incapable following instructions if you can't manage it . addition , if you plan give one gift , open box first - bowl one mine arrived cracked several places . i still love my mister , though	1

this clipper replaced old wahl clipper i bought 18 years ago ( started locking up ) . only problem i i run it through hair more slowly than my older one . i tried adjusting cutting plate indicated instructions , but could not make it better ( i could make it worse ) , although i may still not it quite right . if i run it through hair too quickly , it doesn't cut . if i slow down -- which force me pay attention more carefully , maybe that good -- it cuts just fine . i'm otherwise pleased it , but only it few months	-1

this device pretty good , kids loved sleeping it running . then i purchased gauss meter discovered whopping 400.0 mg emf radiating it . considering most countries recommend nothing higher than 1.0 mg , anything over 10.0 mg considered extreme cancer risk this completely unacceptable . emf declined rapidly range device increases , effectively dropping 0 6 feet . however people put this their nightstand should immediately rectify situation ! fact matter , all electrical devices should always minimum 5 feet away body bedrooms . even so , i question engineering this device if it emits such drastic level emf .	-1

i am total sucker aesthetically pleasing product design , so i went ahead got crane orange my dorm room despite few negative reviews . well , after day usage , i yet discover anything complain whatsoever -- it worked right out box very easy setup , all intents purposes it completely * silent * , it puts lot moisture into air , it ridiculously cute . i notice it hiccup little when you change setting -- , it'll stop putting moisture into air minute or two , then restart new setting . i don't see this problem though , since i played it little while it appears reliable , it just takes minute " think " i guess . my old dorm room " normal " humidifier it , i forget exact model but it one standard lower price range ones , i would actually rate this little fruit above more " adult " slightly more expensive one . so far , this one hasn't spilled all , worked perfectly upon refill ( unlike other one which took lot jiggling coaxing ) , just sits there ( super quietly ) looks cute its job absolutely no attention needed . i don't know if it would capable humidifying anything larger than perhaps medium sized bedroom , but single room device it perfect	-1
i bought this razor when i stuck without my luggage trip . i not expect much price point , but i plesently surprised how well it shaves . it turned out great travel shaver . it holds charge 5 -6 days shaves ( once day ) . however it not gentle shaver , used agressivly it bit hard skin - but produce good close shave . foil shave trimmer works ok but bit awkward . overall it gives nice shave price great light weight travel shaver	-1

this clipper great value money . motor bit stronger than some other models , but not strong kind used professional groomers . because , you trim slowly so clipper " keep up . " kit all attachments you need clip your dog appropriate length . my surprise , i no trouble trimming my cocker spaniel face , around her eyes , etc . but clipping thick fur her legs bit harder . my results her legs body bit ragged . i probably just use this clipper visits groomer , so i don't go often . instructional video rather brief focused mainly poodle cut , very quick explanations two other breeds . it helpful me see person video clipping dogs feet , ears , face so i could learn proper technique . overall , this decent clipper very good price , but it not replace occasional visits groomer	-1

i really excited when i saw these reading glasses split nose bar , how nifty , just wear them looped over back your neck click lens part together whenever you read fine print . great idea , but execution idea not everyone . back piece also hard plastic , rigid , if you long hair , you lift them out under your hair place plastic back strip your mid-skull level , fit them your ears then fit front parts together snap . back you end up looking like you wearing external orthodontic apparatus . i'd like see company put string place hard plastic loops around your neck . magnetic clip brings two lenses together front fabulous idea , two lenses hanging off sides instead whole pair glasses swaying across your front so much more comfortable out way - it just rigid frame back makes me wonder if anyone really tried using these things before they mass manufactured	-1
this terrific scale family use . all body fat , body composition monitors , you enter your personal data you get body fat readouts . but when there multiple users home , you remember which user profile you . not this one . this scale automatically picks out correct usere profile when you step it . its auto auto select feature . i think it it matching weight against profile or something . but it works that all i care . great looking scale it gives you body fat , bmi , hydration weight . price also better than most these features .	1

this best product dry hands . my skin always becomes so dry ( chicago winters you ) , especially my hands because i wash them often . i've using neutrogena norweigan formula hand creme some time now , but switched over eucerin once i tried it . texture far superior - silky , light , not greasy all , but still strong enough really repair dry skin . it leaves your hands feeling amazingly soft , i noticed huge difference first time i used it . 2.7 ounce tubes great because it small enough fit into purse without cumbersome , but you don't need much per application , so it lasts while . this product actually very similar l'ocitanne hand lotion , which very devoted following . but if you don't feel like spending $20 2 ounces , i highly recommend eucerin , which cheaper alternative comparable quality	1

this laundry detergent cleans well , economical ( especially larger sizes , course ) , relatively " environmentally friendly ( see below some questions this ) . " 7th generation cleans using enzymes vegetable-based ingredients instead harsher chemicals . moreover , it non-toxic completely biodegradable . while it relatively easy ( least , some areas ) these days find other detergents no phosphates , concentrated , no dyes or fragrances ( although it little harder find product without any these ) , this product also contains no optical brighteners , not tested animals . ok , why brag your product no optical brighteners ? well , these colorless , fluorescent chemicals biodegrade slowly . some optical brighteners dangerous fish other water-dwellers , some produce eye skin irritation ( although i wouldn't rub 7th generation my eyes either ) . here full ingredient list product ( available seventhgeneration.com, but edited me ): ingredients : coconut-based surfactants , non-animal derived enzymes , natural water softener alkalinity builder ( borax ) , agent wash away soils ( sodium gluconate ) , viscosity control agent ( table salt ) , natural fragrance ( citrus oil ) , preservative ( less than 0.05% ) , water . perhaps ironically , i'm going lower my rating little because 7th generation full disclosure policy . borax table salt generally mined ( company doesn't mention how they obtain these chemicals -- they should ) , fragrance-free detergent contains fragrance ( ! ) -- citrus oil -- albeit natural one . if they're going make " no fragrances " or " masking agents " selling point , then addition any " fragrance " seems strange , given company disclosure commitment	-1

i've tried dozens different lip balm products over last 20 years . i first tried neutrogena solution 10 years ago . two things i despise lip balm : waxy feeling horrible taste/aftertaste . many competitor products one or both those failings , especially ones labelled " medicated " . if you use balm regular basis , you don't want know it there , it should just work ; highest compliment i pay neutrogena product . only downside product its relatively high price compared competition . this case , old adage " you get what you pay " quite true	1

i read all reviews before i bought this shaver . there couple who didn't like shaver . i agree them . i think electric shavers should quiet , shave close , shave fast , shave without irritation , some degree quality . close shave one you cannot feel stubble when you push your finger against direction beard growth . this shaver not shave close . after several weeks shaving it still burns putting after-shave . it takes too much time shave . it fairly quiet . battery longevity average . construction quality average price range . it rated 2 stars overall . i not replace cutting head when it wears out but discard shaver .	-1
this first time i ever posted comment product , but i am so enthusiastic this shaver i feel i must share my experience . first use this product , i felt if i come out dark ages shaving . my most hated daily routine become joy ! i migrated blades foil shaving 5 years ago , thought remarkable achievement , addition conserving blood possibly saving my life . although last consumer reports test showed there virtually no difference foil rotary shaving , i got bug when local store put all their rotary shavers sale . they assured me i could return any shaver any reason , so i nothing lose . after reviewing online comments , wanting cord/cordless , i narrowed my search down norelco 7885xl remington r-960 , which quite bit less expensive than norelco . i brought them home , waited 2 days growth beard , performed " face-off . " ( pardon pun ) i shaved one side my face noreleo other remington . i felt my face noticed no big difference . but later , i noticed norelco side felt slightly irritated . i warned there might transition period foil rotary , so this didn't concern me . but , i never get irritated remington side . next day i felt my face could clearly tell growth remington side less than norelco side . my conclusion i got closer shave no irritation remington -- far less money ! my lifelong belief price not necessarily equal excellence product again reinforced . after first few days i went back got r-960 travel , i happily shaving first time my life because this great shaver . r-960 appears me better built , certainly more stylish , comes sturdy , high quality case . it good grip requires absolutely no pressure my face order get close shave . no more stray hairs my girlfriend usually discovers after it too late remove them . i never my life believed i would look forward shaving -- but now i'm shave heaven	1

i bought this scale because i embarking new fitness plan . after losing 40lbs getting shape , i wanted become stronger , add muscle , while not gaining fat i worked so hard lose . i bought this scale monitor different fitness programs , key i could now distinguish gains fat gains lean mass -- muscle . almost i year i exercised least 5 times week , much it weightlifting , but also running , swimming , soccer many other activities . during time i kept track everything i ate . sometimes i would keep positive energy balance , gain muscle while not gaining or minimizing fat , other times i would negative energy balance lose fat while not losing or minimizing muscle gain . nutrition portion my plan i got excellent book power eating susan . kleiner . it roughly year , i feel great . when i play soccer i feel swift bird strong snake . i lift considerably more weight then year go . when i look mirror , i not only look bigger , but more defined . i believe i gained considerable amount muscle , perhaps 5 pounds , lost equal amount fat . i say i believe because according scale i am exactly where i year ago . when i gaining weight , scale always said it roughly 50/50 , when i lost weight it roughly same . i feeling pretty defeated until i stumbled across some photos my self year ago . difference striking obvious . i only conclude scale consistently overestimated fat gain , underestimated muscle gain . i know scale accurately measures my weight because i checked it against other scales . however , terms measuring changes body composition , reason i bought scale , it total failure . i defense weight watchers , they didn't design scale this kind use mind . but it seems me people just trying lose weight served normal scale while those targeting fat but not muscle , would given bad information this scale . i am now looking new scale , one claims monitor changes muscle mass , but i much more skeptical my next scale . i would very interested other people experiences , since i am now position not able assess fitness program i spent great deal effort . if you any advice or similar experience please email me suprruby@sbcglobal.ne	-1

hahaha , sorry length my very first amazon review . i'm sure i'll become faster more efficient i go . i've cleancut/femini combo couple months now except i shavey femini trimmer isn't t-bar . i find it great managing angles , shapes , tight spaces ( i've heard t-bar motor little stronger if you prefer ) . i applied some baby powder several minutes , it got hair down good stubble i shaped nice neat inverted triangle like i wanted . i'd holding out doing anything until set arrived so naturally , it took longer because i lot work . coarse hair wasn't problem little teeth though i didn't get nicked , even while getting pesky hair inner areas . i'd still say careful around those parts though . cleancut fit my curves nicely thanks its smaller size finishing job easy . cut closer , you should run opposite directional growth pull skin taught you go . it isn't close razor but i don't get any itchiness or rashes far less ingrowns which usually big problem me otherwise . i consider more than fair trade-off . just make sure you're clean , dry , powdered best results substancially lessened chance possible bite or irritation ... which you should probably most dry shavers anyway . i've tested it small area without dry lubricant it cause irritation so sure always use something . baby powder cheap there different kinds talc cornstarch based ; regular , scented , medicated ... i mention it cheap ?! can't go wrong couple bucks big bottle it . :p note , it true battery makes up most unit weight . but makes no difference me because it cuts through my coarse stubble no problem or lag spinning . it isn't loud but it make audible high humming noise . noise wasn't enough bother me i consider myself pretty uptight those things . you use them your facial hair too if wet shaving gives you ingrowns you hate waxing ... just uh , wash or wipe off foil if you use it your privates first , lol . sometimes i even use it under my arms . like most advertised things , it not miraculous amazing ads claim but you should already know not ride entirely them . said , i not disappointed it i hope someday they make wet/dry version so i don't worry getting it wet . i've used it regularly since i got it there no razors down there anymore	-1
i love this cleanser ! i use it all time , it seems work really well me . it really keep oil off my face my acne down managable level ! it only face wash i use regular basis , it doesn't burn my face or leave my skin dried out . plus side it " foam " cleanser , so it doesn't " dig " into your face or hurt when you wash it paces you acne . - it also doesn't nasty smell . i really like it lot . my opinion it worth $ , so try it ! if you've tried almost everything else ( like i , ) what you lose really ? - i'm glad i tried it , because it best daily cleanser i've found yet ! - i've using this product quite while now , i just finally decided write review . i've always got good results , so try it , you'll glad you	1

i light acne scarring usually takes quite some time fade , especially my cheeks . so far , i've noticed these scars clearing up little faster , due peel removing topmost layer dead cells , allowing skin underneath breathe heal . i've also noticed smaller breakout area week before menstruation , which something blessing . my only disappointment due price , customers can't get small trial size try it patch skin before using it . even at-home glycolic peels should tested small , easily covered part skin before using it your entire face . some people terrible reaction . use caution before doing full treatmen t.t here some notable flushing skin , somewhat like increased skin bloodflow comes taking wrong kind niacin tablet . you should tingling sensation , not burning sensation . if it any way painful , remove it immediately . it definitely not good idea use this any facial cleanser contains menthol ( check your labels - menthol bad ingredient facial cleansers anyway ) , it not let your skin cool after using , burn	1
i love these baby-safe disposable diapers . i use kissaluvs cloth diapers during day my little girl , but use tushies night when we're run or traveling . absorbancy great night -- better than kissaluvs booster doubler . they keep moisture away her skin -- safely since there no gel used these diapers ( fyi , gels used other diapers never proven safe federal government not regulate materials/chemicals used baby diapers -- which means manufacturers not required law disclose materials/chemicals used diapers . kinda makes you wonder why infertility rates rise ! hmmm . ) . sometimes we poop blowouts when we're run since barrier cuff leg latex-free ( which good thing , though -- makes diaper more baby-safe ) , so i just use bummies super whisper wrap diaper cover over tushies diaper -- just case . these diapers come highly recommended if you care what you put against your baby skin . i can't protect her all bad stuff , but this just one small thing i home reduce her exposure nasty chemicals materials	1
these diapers fantastic ! i myself prefer cloth diapers , but because we high water table if we much laundry our septic backs up into our house - yuck ! i am also severely chemically sensitive so scent " normal " diapers even seventh generations ones gel make me ill . but these great !! they made wood pulp/paper feel if there cotton them . they no chemical scent all feel nice soft smooth my fingers . they close means adhesive strip either side closes onto larger piece thin plastic either side . if you accidentally close adhesive strip paper it tear when you pull it back off usually not reseal . this not problem if you use them only once . we potty our baby so sometimes we take it off put it back few times before it gets wet or dirty . other than accidentally sticking strips paper i haven't problem using them like this . there elastic legs but it basically encased so it isn't contact skin they snug enough my baby legs . these little harder tell if they wet than seventh generation ones ( i've never used regular diapers since i can't get near them their chemical scent ) because there isn't gel . i usually just put finger it then touch finger my thumb then i tell if i feel dampness or not . if my baby pees lot though it easy tell if it wet ... even outside because it look little more molded form , but not feel damp outside inside less damp even then than cloth diaper . packaging says you should not let baby put these his/her mouth since it paper tear off their mouth it should not held near flame - again because it made out paper . but all said , these not flimsy all , they well made hold up just well regular disposable . i highly recommend these anyone who whom cloth diapers just isn't possible or those times when impractical ( day care ) those people who want limit their baby exposures chemicals	1
i expecting excellent product norelco when i purchased this replace my worn out conair trimmer . it turns out quality just fair . it works ok trimming facial hair though not perfectly . i strongly suggest not using this trimming body hair because it very easy clip your skin . no matter how careful i am i can't avoid drawing blood . i defiantly replacing this set something better very soon .	-1
i bought this while back began finding problems it right away . 1 ) trimmer cannot operate a/c power alone . this means you can't plug it into wall use it . instead , you charge battery , then unplug it use it . 2 ) 2 weeks after i bought it , beard trimmer attachment broke . little tabs hold it different lengths snapped off so you only use it shortest setting , you hold attachment your hand so it won't slide off . clearly , i'm not only one who this happened . 3 ) nose trimmer very dull blades . i don't normally use nose trimmer nor i really need one , but i cheap one i got my christmas stocking i've used few times . out curiosity , i tried attachment came this trimmer introduced new kind pain . it pulling hairs but not cutting them . i contacted representative norelco see if i they would send me replacement beard attachment or if i could purchase just attachment . they directed me their service centers who wanted $10 just attachment . including shipping , it would cost me almost what i payed whole set . my advice : pay little more something sturdier . that what i plan doing	-1

any item neck/head rest should atleast meet your neck or head . this backrest might fit child up 13 y.o. it . it well made but identical others found here $50 . only differences 1 ) cup holder opposite side , 2 ) came power pack run massage unit instead eating battteries , 3 ) reading ligh t.t he power pack smart idea , however massage only lower back it isn't very powerful . let alone it doesn't make good contact your back . i would prefered it more shoulders . light ... well , it pretty worthless led light runs off 4 d-size batteries use run massage unit less expensive models . i guess sharper image find purpose useless battery holder justify getting 3x price this item . my opinion sharper image they charge outrageous price get you think it superior product . it all mail-order catalog junk you could find fraction cost elsewhere . this product identical ( i think it ) homedics one you get walmart $49 , or here amazon , you get choice colors	-1

since moving virginia , i spend least month every spring feeling like i'm waking up bad cold . i promised myself this year , i would try good-quality air purifier . i debated among sharp fp-n60cx plasma cluster air purifier , mitsubishi plasmapure quiet hepa air purifier , this one . end , they all high ratings , i am sure they'd all worked well , but i liked looks this one . turns out , it looks even cooler person . more importantly , i wake up feeling great . also , it inaudible night setting which important since it my bedroom . smell sensor really works - drop new pile laundry near it it go off because dryer sheet smell . my room just so much nicer now although it can't follow me around take care my allergies rest day , it let me get good night sleep , which all i could ask . get into technical side it , there two sensors - one pollen/dust one smells . there indicators front which show mode unit ( such turbo , pollen , night ) well levels indicators smell one side pollen other . i also need mention distributor , sparo , wonderful . i asked them email before my order shipped send silver instead white . they responded quickly no problem . then i let them know two buttons my remote didn't work , they responded immediately they overnighting new one , which they . couldn't happier them or product ! you can't go wrong this	1
after reading other very positive reviews amazon , i bought two these right out gate i'm not regretting it all . i actually bought 780 sq ft . versions . they work great helped reduce my sneezing , etc due sensitity cat dander we two cats . i love automatic feature where it detects impurities odors kicks into gear filter it out . i also like mode allergy season where it alternates medium low filter out allergens air . air our house much more ' fresh ' since we got them . visitors commented how ' clean ' air smells . i bought one each floor our house . i like how light portable they so you move them room room if you'd like . if i am going work my home office , i'll move it bedroom my office put it back bedroom night . lowest fan setting almost inaudible . very quiet . even medium setting not overly loud doesn't bother me when i'm sleeping . i like how you it run certain mode 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 hours but then it shuts off . i'd like it if it just went back auto after timer up , but that minor design flaw my opinion . overall , very pleased purchase . old adage true ; you get what you pay	1
cetaphil extremely easy use . it reccommended my dermatologist i already see results after only 2 weeks . ive tried many acne cleansing products this far best . _it washes off easily_does not irritate skin_gets rid acne_makes your face softer smoothe	1
i two penguin humidifiers which i purchased couple months ago . money i think these great simple use . i not any problems leakage -- key make sure top securely . also , some minor dripping expected when you take penguin body off base -- just carry washcloth you -- no problem . super quiet . i think it just right size bedroom . easy clean fill . i tried others ( honeywell vicks ) this far my favorite	1
we bought first crane elephant our baby room , when cool mist filter humidifier our bedroom started making weird screech noises , we bought replace it few months later . we've never any trouble them convenience no filter requirement great . i tried find ultrasonic humidifier more " grown-up " design go our bedroom , but they all seemed twice price crane , so since it works great price great , it elephants all around	1
really works pretty well . very quiet , increase humidity room very fast . i fill tank every other day . i put it my desk ( 1m high ) not see it wetted carpet . only thing if you see white dust around , you should buy purified water use it , but it not drawback this product , it common problem any ultrasonic humidifier , which you use if you don't want noisy coolmist	1
very very appropriate home or business use . shaves hair smoothly ....... 5 stars product !!!!	1
i love this bumble bumble conditioner . it smells fantastic ! if you don't like smell coconut however don't use this product . it beachy smell . it heavy moisturizing conditioner , so don't use too much or it could weigh your hair down . i very thick straight highlighted hair feel this conditioner leaves it silky smooth color undamaged . i tried lot different hair products this one far my favorite	1
i love these - our baby allergic all other wipes , even those sensitive skin . these work wonderfully , she no problems them	1
i absolutely love this razor . i tried many different razors this only one works me . my last one i 3 years it got stolen . so i tried many others they only ripped hair out my face . i decided buy this again am thoroughly pleased . i hope they never stop making it . it one cheapest out there	1
i heard all hype surrounding remington their shaving products but i always stayed away because price . this case i made gamble , satisfied price , i decided test it . hype associated this brand well worth it , they clearly know how make electric shaver . it contours my face gives me " closest " shave i ever . it takes little time get used closeness but your face certainly feels looks different . you spend little more $ get more sophisticated model but this model works fine me . stick this brand there nothing like it	-1
well , i must agree those who said this shaver mediocre . i bought refurbished one $20 it worth , but not penny more . it not give close shave without going over your face several times . my norelco worked this well when blades 8 years old ! i admit , i usually shave twice norelco , but remington not nearly good . get decent shave , i press pretty hard go over each area several times . i end up bit redness pressing i get shaver work reasonably well . if you're buying shaver $40 , save your money find norelco that sale	-1
i both very dry very easily sunburned skin , so moisturizing sunscreen must . i've using this eucerin lotion years now . perhaps my skin bit sensitive , but whenever i've tried switch something less expensive or easier find , i've adverse reactions . now eucerin only thing i use my face	1
i purchased these because i wanted some curl my very straight , fine hair . packaging very compact very portable . metal pins held even my fine hair place . they not get " hot " 90 seconds advertised ( more like 4-5 min ) get more than just " warm " , lid sealed . amount curlers just right my shoulder length hair , however red rods too big just produced " body " not so much curls . i would think if you longer hair or just wanted body this would 5++ . i bought them " red " super department store just 12.99 ! overall , i would recommend they nice - just didnt suit my needs	-1
i used many facial products including very pricey products this one my favorites . it makes my skin feel soft luxurious whereas other products i've used either made my skin feel dry or no difference . i also noticed after using this full month age spot i under my eye almost completely faded	1
best cream ever ! this one really works , amazing !!	1
i am tired replacing bathroom windows plastering holes walls each time one these babies decides take flight . mach 3 fine , i'm sure it provides rapid shave : i just don't like sonic booms	-1

not even worth 1 star but 0 not option ; i used rope only 5 times before it shredded pieces broke . it worse product i've ever used . bally must already know defect this product but yet still selling it ; i work out often ropes before but none this poor quality . my last rope cheap nylon rope which i forgot my hotel room while traveling it much better quality because i it over 3 years it never gave me any trouble i used it faithfully everyday . first all , this bally rope would not stay doorknob so i tied it tight so it would'nt come off .. then while using it it start smelling if it burning pieces shreds black rope start falling my face . then pulley start hanging out after only week using it .. rope shredded broke off pully all together .. so there u it .. u curious buy it see yourself but i ignore bad review before i ordered it also .. thinking it can't bad .. ;)) .. but it worse than review bally lose major points me ... i would'nt even work out their gym because they intentionally cheated people out money because i'm sure they test products before selling them they know this bad product . well okay there u it .. if u don't believe my review .. order see yourself .	-1
this piece junk--don't bother . when i originally ordered thought it bally balls end . this just rope pulleys . not even elasticized . really , when you return pay postage , you paying item getting nothing	-1
this good solid trimmer , first one i've tried . i've used scissors up now but couldn't get even cut . this gives nice even trim quickly , only drawback my nose itches vibrations , but i get used . some reviews this other trimmers mention heat build-up ( no problem ) electric smell ( there , but not bad ) . keep mind you must exhale while trimming or you'll breathe hairs	-1

i replaced norelco rotary shaver braun . i liked idea shaver cleaned , sanitized charged after each shave so i bought braun . so far , it shaves much closer than my norelco . shaver not quite " mobile " norelco due its shape it noisier than my norelco , but it comfortable my face good job . cleaning system works well but also noisy 5 minutes . you replace cleaning fluid cartridge after every so many cleanings , but doesn't entail lot money . all all , i like shaver would buy it again . i use pre-shaving fluid my face it seems help closeness shave	-1
this my " most favourite " perfume whole world , my six year old daughter would say!it light airy beautiful draws many compliments , makes you feel good . i defy anyone bad day while wearing it	1

i use this curling iron daily basis found it works very well styling large , smooth waves . i not able find this size any curling irons stores my area or any areas i traveled . it not very expensive , easy order , works years without any problems . only aspect this curling iron i would change would quicker heating time . it take 3-4 or more minutes heat up i must remember plug it turn it few minutes before i need use it .	-1
" heat resistent " tip not heat resistant all . it too short function properly burns your fingers . i used this once am now stuck it .	-1
although rather small using rechargeable battery , i using this trimmer trim all body hair , including my scalp , which main reason i purchased it . it somewhat small trimmer " head " virtue rechargeable it necessary user make more than one pass over scalp , but if you want cut your hair close blade , this unit it just fine .... other hand , because it so small lightweight , it extremely easy non-tiring use . motor noise certainly lot less than my older , standard hair trimmer , which makes terribly loud noise . so far , i would recommend this trimmer anyone who looking one use all over body , including scalp .	-1
i am one those individuals who cannot wear any scent i may drawn because most give me headaches . few i wear this one my favorite ! it light subtle , not powdery , not overbearing so someone needs right next you beaware your fragrance . there nothing worse , my opinion , than overwhelmed someone else scent . i even wear this when i'm staying-in because i enjoy fragrance much . my only criticism reason 4* vs . 5 , scent not stick around long enough . i find myself reapplying once ( least ) day . they need body oil or lotion . i haven't tried gel yet but maybe layering it would help it last .	-1
never thought see it . this razor shaves close blade . fast , light , comfortable hand .	1
i've using this few days , i've used it both dry light lather shaving cream . color me impressed ! this thing shaves least close my blades ( gillette sensor excell ) , more consistent results less chance cuts . it very comfortable use , my skin better shape after shaving than when i use manual blade . i actually lightly scrape myself lightly it my adam apple first use due using too much pressure raised area , so it definitely getting close it requires bit technique . but easily mastered , i've no problems since then . they say give it 30 days your face beard acclimate new shaver , but i don't think that going necessary . i don't foresee regularly using manual blade anymore . i'm getting better results less time more convenience than i got blades . i've zero issues clean up . i just put it under running water motor running it gets clean . it special 17000rpm cleaning mode ( " turbo " - what doesn't use moniker these days ? ) make sure it gets clean . you use bit hand soap ( per instructions ) cleaning foils it lather out , then you rinse it off , it like new again . i can't imagine needing cleaning station comes other packages this same razor . this great electric razor - recommended .	1
i leg cramps often this massager next my bed helped me make it through lot nights . it also helped me make it through many , many nights when my legs last things i my mind ;) attachments not really impressed me , but results magic wand provides i really don't mind all . this massager could actually turn out woman best friend ;) if i could give it 10 stars i would	1
this third time i am buying this product i really skeptic when i bought it first , but i really love way it makes my skin feel . it gives my skin glowing look , which my skin usually lacks brightens up my face . i use it like 3 times week so makes my skin little dry , but if i use moisturiser i not problem either	1
i surprised how smoothly enzyme peel went . it didn't leave my skin feeling tight uncomfortable like lot other peels . i liked fact it easy apply easy remove , leaving my skin soft moisturized . only thing i didn't like smell . it wasn't bad but it surprise after using scented products past . i would recommend zia fresh papaya enzyme peel others	1
this item great . careful if you sweaty though	1
i wasn't going try this first because i thought it might " weak " because packaging looks really pretty delicate - more like face cream than sunblock . i only tried it because i received " buy one get one free " coupon - i pleasently surprised ! this only sunblock i use now . it isn't greasy , dries quickly , relatively water/sweat resistant , really blocks sun . i used it when i went kayaking it saved me painful burn . areas i didn't apply sunblock carefully burnt peeling . neat part you see my fingermarks areas i carelessly slapped some sunblock proves how well this product work ( if used properly )	1
i knew what thickness when i ordered . i wasn't expecting much . its great , very comfortable , it springs right back into shape when you get off it	-1
i used tell everyone what great trimmer this ! i took very good care it probably used it my face or eyebrows only two or three times month . then ten months after receiving it , plastic head portion holds blade fell off not reattach . i guess if i want continue using this trimmer , i figure out way tape or glue head back unit . it comes one year warranty , but because i received it gift , i not receipt . i contacted emjoi they refused replace it , even though i used it less than year . i asked if they would repair it my expense told they not repairs , only replacements . so , here expensive little gadget company not worry keeping its customers satisfied . obviously i no longer recommend this emjoi product anyone . save yourself lot money buy $10 version discount/drug stores . then , if when it breaks , you won't feel so badly throwing it away	-1

i bought two these brushes . i love way they work , but they break too quickly . neither one them lasted longer than three months ( package says replace heads every three four months ... think it ) first one great while , but water got into battery compartment caused batteries leak . i blamed it myself went out buy new one . i extra careful not get bottom wet , which interesting considering it product made used around water . not disgusting , but how you rinse off your saliva without getting it wet ??? this second one lasted little bit longer than first one , but now i interesting problem where i cannot get battery compartment fit back inside brush ! even batteries not inside it , compartment not snap all way . if it not closed , it won't run , water would able get inside anyway . following points consider , their own they would not bother me but i'll mention them anyway : -the battery compartment , when working , little difficult get open . -on first brush i no problem getting power switch slide up wet hands , but second brush switch went considerably harder i need put my hand inside towel turn brush . -as far it whitening properties , i don't know if it , i've never paid attention . it keep my teeth clean though . other hand , my boyfriend bought his same time i bought my first one , his still going strong . he doesn't treat his any special way , so it looks like it just roll dice whether or not you get good brush . i'm not taking chance any more , next brush different brand . i'd rather buy more expensive brush lasts long time than cheap one i replace every 3 months .	-1

wow 5 blades instead three ? who would thought ? i smell noble price here ! don't let great cosmetic design fool you . it turned out same thing but more blades . i really excited waiting my brand new fusion power razor arrive , i am allergic shaving so this big issue me . after first shave my hopes destroyed . it turned out same thing . they even mentioned blades closer improvement , when fact , i think they forced it way because if not they would ended up huge cartridge would not fit contours face . only obvious new feature trimmer , which only , feature , not real technical advance . i hope someday these companies start invest part income they get overpriced cartridges research development , instead investing it marketing . way , my power handle came broken , so i couldn't test this feature , although i power handles past other blades difference minimal . what next , let me guess , 7 blades ? i guess these guys should really start working something new because " adding more blades " thing getting exhausted .	1

i paid $45 this aesthetically pleasing scale . sure it looks nice , but if it doesn't its job , it not much accessory bathroom . it took me while figure out how scale works . there lot beeps involved . essentially , program your info , you start pressing mode button , adjust your height , press mode , adjust your age , press mode , select your gender , press mode , select normal athlete , press mode you hear beep confirm . then store , press either up button memory #s 1 , 3 5 or down button #s 2 , 4 6 , press mode there beep confirm . still me ? if you just want your weight , you just step scale , but if you want get your body fat water % , you must press up or down button find your memory # , then press mode wait beep before you step scale . now i don't know you , but this procedure lot more cumbersome than any other scale i owned . so fine , i've now figured out how work thing . getting even somewhat accurate results thing . when i stepped scale , i would sometimes surprised weight . i didn't think i could gain 7 pounds one day ( i eat very healthy my weight range usually 3-4 pounds ) . but if you step scale again , like some other digital scales , it seems remember your last weight won't give you your real weight . so i put some other object it get reading then scale resets . i step scale again my weight now 6 pounds less than original reading ! body water % didn't fluctuate too much body fat % 3% higher than reading last scale i owned ( conair thinner brand ) . all all , i am returning this scale going back drawing board finding something even least bit accurate .	1

good : massage function works fine , no problems performance , battery holds good charge . bad : how much money saved construction using cheapest foam padding imaginable ? ugly : ' pebbled vinyl ' material arms already separating after six months . maybe cheaper material could found ... but i doubt it . overall good theory , but very poor execution . if some real quality put into product , it would rate potentially 5 stars .

i cracked heals bit callous problem . they aren't dragon feet , but they softened pretty often . i used little blade scraper tool few years works well but when i saw artemis heel smoother advertised , i decided i try it . it waste money . appliance no more than low-tech dreml . fact , i dreml type tool marketed dog nail trimmer works better . artemis appliance not scrape any dried skin away .. it merely sands your foot bit .. when you get darn thing stay spot you put it . it comes small container foot conditioning balm probably just straight cocoa butter except it really offensive aroma . i would just soon use piece sand paper than this thing . save your money .	1

i got fusion razor mail few weeks ago so i decided give it try . first it seemed ok , but i started noticing it pulled hair my face more than my mach 3 turbo . i decided experiment shave half my face mach 3 turbo other half fusion . my experience , mach 3 turbo gave closer shave , glided much smoother across my skin than fusion . i think 5 blades fusion more gimmick than anything else . cool single trimming blade , it seems like gillette include this because poor accuracy 5 blades . other words , single blade fix rather than feature . my call if your using mach 3 turbo , don't waste your money fusion	1

i very thick , very coarse , wavy hair . when my two year old chi straightening iron broke , i needed replace it quickly ! locally only iron i could find t3 tourmaline iron , so i thought i'd give it try . it cost more than chi , sold fancy salon , could even used damp hair . surely it would good replacement . unfortunately , it failed impress . -it not leave my hair silky smooth . while my hair certainly straighter , it still looked coarse . ( this hottest setting several passes over hair)-because my hair so thick , iron needs reduce volume . t3 failed this respect , too . -i thought i would like larger ( almost 2 " ) iron surface . t3 perfectly flat surface , which made it impossible get flip or curl ends . needless say , i returned it quickly pricey salon getting chi ! perhaps this brand would work better someone fine hair , since temperature adjusted	1

i purchased waterpik na-2 gentle sinuse rinse attachment , expecting it work waterpik professional ultra dental water jet , since what advertised . they don't fit this model , so don't waste your time purchasing both together ! sinus attachments too short , so they can't " click " into water pik . end result : water leaks out , there no pressure through sinus attachment . i return both items since amazon rep couldn't find any sinus attachment work waterpik ultra model . it shame because i love small footprint waterpik ultra , it comes lot cool attachments . hopefully waterpik come up something near future	-1
i owned this set 2 half years before i finally just gave up switched different brand hot rollers ( i used it 4-5 times per year ) . first off , rollers very heavy so when you them all place , it feels like you carrying laundry basket your head . second , rollers hot touch so burning issue when rolling up your hair . third , clips used hold rollers place fantastically difficult use . i would roll up my hair ( which would take like , 30 minutes because difficulty ) , if i walked around house watch tv while i waited my hair set , clips would spring out place shoot across room . i eventually lost like 6 clips " springing out " thing . results these rollers great , though . i used them my wedding day people loved it . good results , but not worth time effort use these rollers	1

reviewer who compared massage feature cell phone perhaps said it best , so suffice it say one essentially ignore aspect unit [ i might even liken vibrations those injured ( no longer airborne ) housefly buzzing circles ] . respect heat(ing ) , it perform better , but no means stellar . pro its design moisture , better-than-average fabric/material - which holds its shape fairly well auto shut-off . con include , others said , huge ac-dc plug/power pack , no apparent ability wash darn thing , only modest heat , annoying velcro straps , two-part power cord not only must taped keep together , but can't removed main pad washing , perhaps most significantly , fact mine died after approx . 18 months ( which , incidentally , raises yet detractor ; warranty only year , much less than many other brands )	1
if you're just mixing non-gas-forming drink mixes , this thing works acceptably well , but if you're mixing something like " ionic fizz " magnesium drink fizzes up bit , it not very useful because it just doesn't form very good seal , no matter how tightly you close it . reviewer mentioned , it very easy cross-thread lid . thicker threads deeper threads would probably help . it great sipping though , easy enough keep clean . but i went back using plastic 16-oz milk bottle always forms tight seal when you close it . seal this bottle too flaky because it difficult tell if you've cross-threaded it until you start shaking it . i'd expected bottle designed shaking mixing drinks would paid little more attention problems this . i don't use this any more , because it too annoying worry seal cross-threading . don't waste your money it .	1

bayer name-brand aspirin . any brand-name drug cost least double equivalent generic aspirin . i give this one-star rating not because it poor product , rather , because it so expensive . dosage 81 mg , taken thin blood prevent heart attacks strokes ( generally taken older individuals who perhaps arteriosclerosis , heart attack or stroke ) . aspirin wonder-drug , very first analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication hit market over 100 years ago . it mild moderate pain treats many different conditions such arthritis , bone inflammation , joint pain , even reduces fever . aspirin causes blood platelets not adhere each other , thus it " thins " blood prevents blood clots forming . aspirin thus used emergency treatment heart attacks strokes . some folks take " baby " aspirin ( 81-160 mgs ) each day prevent blood clots forming . aspirin actually acetyl-salicylic acid . manufacturers alter structure aspirin slightly grant it different properties terms its digestion , make digestion easier . some buffer it antacids while others coat tablet coating prevents its digestion stomach ( like ecotrin ) . regular aspirin , without any buffering or coatings tolerated most people , but some cannot take it without severe stomach upset . these folks , buffered form god-send . unfortunately , aspirin fell out favor 60 70 when reye syndrome developed some children ( under age 16 ) who took aspirin while they flu and/or chickenpox . 30% children affected died many more permanent brain damage . because reye syndrome , alternate analgesics placed market , premier tylenol . there no reason fear using aspirin if you adult , reye syndrome only occurred children under 16 years age . usual dose aspirin 350 mg , " extra-strength form 500 mg . most adults easily tolerate dose 650 mg ( 2 tablets ) every 4 hours maximum daily dose 5,200 mg .

if you want my review nutshell , here it : two defective rise shine lamps . one call verilux . verilux refuses help . if you wish learn how this sorry state affairs came pass , read . my verilux product experience : i exchanged my first verilux rise shine natural alarm clock bedside lamp due non-functional internal speaker , ostensibly loose wires shaken loose during shipping ( if i am understand verilux ' company president response similar defect report these reviews ) . good news : speaker second unit now works . contrary some other reviewers i feel mylar speaker sounds quite good -- although dual stereo speakers would even better choice ( line-in jack cd player or ipod ) . bad : despite jumbo lcd display might lead you assume am/fm tuner digital , radio completely analog . station ids printed roughly 7-point type tuning dial instead -- small enough some owners need their glasses magnifying glass select radio station . contrast , i own alarm clock conair similar analog tuner , exception it uses roughly 8-point lcd digits represent radio frequency lower right-hand corner backlit lcd display . verilux ' comparatively enormous lcd , i am left wonder why design team failed consider option . analog tuner without station display something i expect $15 drugstore alarm clock , but not product this type , which otherwise very well thought out . unfortunately , due apparent flaw shade and/or lamp itself , shade my replacement lamp -- lamp i received store exchange -- won't sit straight ! one remove shade , look lamp level surface , see lamp " shelf " slope downward such shade itself also similarly slanted ! making situation worse , lampshade also slightly off insofar ring not centered . there three metal supports attached top shade bent downward welded ring sits half way down ( typical most lampshades ) . ring , turn , sits lamp body ( or shelf ) . whole assembly cockeyed , including socket into which bulb sets ( very obvious angle) ! cosmetically speaking , there also problems surprising see product this type . whereas first lamp i purchased very prominent nick plastic edge alongside lcd panel , replacement lamp scratch ivory plastic lamp body inch below shade shelf , it , too , must obtained manufacturing . shade itself , it came out plastic wrap beige blemish , roughly 3/4 " , looks like pale stain against bright white linen . so while second lamp not doa speaker , i apparently traded one problem . worse , lamp appears lopsided even opposite side room ( would probably appear way down street if i set it curb ) . short , verilux rise shine lamp just not up quality price/warranty suggests . case you wondering if this might " gray market " merchandise , it wasn't . i purchased my rise shine lamp straight out high-end , authorized retail store , new-in-box . am/fm clock radio paired sunrise-simulating full-spectrum light , finished off eight high-quality digital nature sounds -- contained space-saving design roughly 6.5 " wide base 20 " tall -- makes outstanding combination concept . this reason , i hope verilux continue refine rise shine model , particularly where quality control concerned . given i am gadget fan , someone who rated products 1/5th price this lamp very highly , it should understood i really wanted give this positive review . but two duds row ? ironythe rise shine user manual emphatically instructs consumers contact verilux directly instead returning defective products retailer . given my replacement lamp also defective , i followed these instructions . but reality , verilux wants defective merchandise become retailers ' problem , not theirs ( per instruction i received make third 40-mile trip back store where i purchased it ) . conclusion ? verilux doesn't back their warranty ( my experience/opinion ) . nor , apparently , verilux care what kind impression they leave firs t-t ime customers . so if you think impressive three-year warranty help you if something should go wrong , consider what happened less than 72 hours into my ownership experience . believe me , there no rudeness involved provoke this kind reaction part verilux ' customer service department , either . what verilux apparently forgotten this age internet . it so happens , i supplement my income writing product reviews websites . fact , i am writer training/trade . translation : verilux chose wrong customer let down . i no intention smearing verilux ' reputation -- unless telling truth nothing but truth my experience qualifies such . would i recommend this product friend ? yesterday i might said yes , chalking up non-operative speaker first lamp fluke . today , coupled fact verilux seemingly not wish stand behind their products even when it would take mere lampshade keep customer happy , my answer resounding no . should anyone verilux read my review , i wish close this thought : i could learned live cosmetic problems i noted , but ~ $5 lampshade , replace one blemished right out box -- doesn't sit straight , boot -- not worth keeping firs t-t ime customer happy ?	1

i'm cursed sensitive skin tough beard . i'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated , so i carefully prep shaving . after years trial error , i've finally settled good shaving cream system : cetaphil skin cleanser base , then kiss my face moisture shave supplement . post-shave comfort prevent breakouts , i use product like cleanclear dual-action oil-free moisturizing lotion . however , weak link up until now actual shaver . gillette fusion power , i've finally found right one . i've used gillette since they gave my unit free razors during first gulf war ( i marines time ) . they've gotten job , but 3-blade system ultimately inadequate my beard skin type . it doesn't take long blades start cutting my face neck , especially since i take forever change blades . i dreaded looking bathroom mirror work seeing dried blood spots ( not mention getting blood stains my collar ) . electric shavers don't work me either - too hard my skin , i'd five-o'clock shadow around 2pm . so , when i saw gillette touting their new 5-blade system , i gave it shot . i initially skeptical powered aspect due my issues electric shavers . but fusion power happy exception . first i struggled bit getting battery cap off end . but once i mastered maneuver got battery , i set . it takes one aaa-battery seems last decent interval ( low-battery indicator nice touch ) . even if fusion power runs out juice , you still shave it . shaver glides over my face , vibration feels good - kind like pick-me-up morning . five blades really nail my beard , even tough spots like my chin jaw line remain cut-free . i also like one-blade trimmer top - very handy evening out my sideburns zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils . my only issue expense blades . but i make them last lot longer than old 3-blade razors while still getting great shave . most importantly , i rarely get those annoying cuts anymore ( if i , it more because rushing or clumsiness than anything else ) . ultimately , result worth higher price . gillette fusion power best shaver i've ever tried . highly recommended	1
i surprised open this pedometer page after sometime see all negative reviews it receives . i using this specific model more than 3 months now i am really satisfied it . it really accurate ( lt ; 1% declination , i performed more than four tests more than 400 steps during different times its life i seen couple cheap pedometers performing much worse ) , clips firmly belt or pants , displays time conveniently nice backlight , even radio which works , although most people said , not really its best feature . truth i am not using radio all , mostly because i believe batteries last longer it save me extra trips walmart . but i tested it it works , although nothing impressive there . course , money , i think you cannot go wrong this pedometer . one funny comment , although most people complain it cannot open very easily , after sometime it open more easily you think . actually it couple times where putting bag my shoulders or waist pouch applying some pressure it mistake , open it wide , so it not count any steps . but it not open itself anyway , needs external force this happen , so it not happen often . all all , i am sure plastic construction less than rigorous production testing result many pieces not function properly result bad reviews . maybe i lucky , maybe not , but this one best most reliable devices i carry use every day . great incentive walking exercising more	1

if you burn lots calories your activities , this high energy food could give you lift . there 250 calories packed into this little 2.4 ounce bar , which advertised least 70% organic . this bar advertised athletes first , casual snack second . if you overweight trying drop pounds , you skip this snack move back unbuttered popcorn . when i opened this bar i noticed it looks like compressed goop . however , compressed goop tastes pretty good . texture much like granola bar , though more moist than granola bar . black cherry part black cherry almond understated . there dried cherries this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor , which big plus . i unable find anything this bar implied it artificial , which even bigger plus . one thing confused me little bar advertised no wheat no dairy , but label bar states there may trace amounts dairy . i guess they either knew there might very small amount dairy or they hedging themselves because possible cross-contamination some other process . either case , vegens consider whether trace amounts dairy makes this acceptable product . label also states there may traces peanuts . this bar also contains 20% daily recommended dietary fiber , which means drinking lots water good idea when eating this bar . there also lots vitamins trace elements , which may good thing unless you take vitamin supplements , which case you may need consider whether you getting too much good thing . clif bars could casual snack , but ingredients their marketing really suggest they geared toward individuals looking healthy energy boost high energy activities . if you fall into category , which could include hiking , climbing , bicycling , running , jogging , other similarly strenuous activities , then this bar could good way packing big punch small package . enjoy !	1

perfectly clear skin through my teens , 20s , most my 30s , i now post-pregnancy adult-onset cystic acne began age 36 . my skin far too delicate sensitive tolerate most otc acne products . i bought this product out desperation , not believing it would work . after reading hundreds reviews advice testing it 2 weeks , i found it works well , some modifications . my experience : cystic acne goes through its normal cycle ( rising surface , becoming hideous scab , etc . ) fraction normal time ( 4 days versus 4 weeks ) when treated directed zeno , or it disappears completely without ever risen surface ( after week or so ) , when treated very aggressively zeno . my advice : don't expect it work after 1-3 treatments 24 hours advertised . know diligence patience , it work . very aggressive . double-cycles ( allow zeno remain your skin after it beeps , then press button second cycle ) every few hours long bump detectable any way . you may get very slight burning your skin ( causing whitish film or slight peeling ) you may go through your cartridge tips quickly , but believe me , it worth it avoid horrible months-long process cystic acne . i am using this conjunction very thorough natural skincare regime improved nutrition , seeing results i hoped after 2 weeks	1
oral eb417 dual head power brush replacement great job getting into tight places , reaching back teeth , removing plaque , nice gum massage action , leaves your mouth teeth feeling clean very refreshed . two heads work twice good one , but may take some getting used if your used single brush head . using it gently guiding it over your teeth , letting it all work , it last long time too . it nearly three months before i replace mine . most oral brushes interchangeable all oral units . this one though , according buying info here , may not used cross action brush . it also indicate when it time replacement fading colors bristles .

this nature made product excellent . however , readers should aware this products not contain iron very good reason . taking iron supplements sets you up potential health problems if you woman over 50 . i hope other reviewer takes note this .	1
best sports bar around . great taste , organic , contains plenty antioxidants , contains good amount protein . only down side high amount carbs , especially sugars , but i still give it five stars	1
i absolutely love this stuff . i would recommend this any person frizz . it makes my hair feel so silky smoothe . i started using it 2 months ago cannot stand go without it . just use little because it make your hair look oily if you use too much don't put it close scalp either same reason . i tried chi silk infusion because i thought they would same since they both made farouk but chi not nearly good . i would give this 100 stars i could .	1

i pumped exclusively my first child no need disposable pads b/c washable ones sufficient . my second child , i both i found these best b/c washable ones not enough . they large so won't shift when you roll bed . they very absorbent though i woken up couple times trenched . they very thin discreet . other pads not big so not enough overage . i never bother adhesives b/c they don't work . they must nursing moms pumping moms first few month when you lots milk . i just wished they softer less paper like	1

i really like this sanitizer . only reason i not give it 5 stars because i wish it bigger so i could fit bottles things slightly larger it . but , i put her pacifiers bottle nipples there .	1
works great but i wish i could find it stores . one riteaid carry it , doesn't always it stock . i also not always find it just any rite aid . some don't carry it all ... annoying ! my daughter canker sore sufferer . i some research before i discovered rembrandt , found ingredient , sodium lauryl sulfate , found almost all toothepastes culprate . rembrandt canker sores not contain this key ingredient . sodium lauryl sulfate ( sls ) what makes our toothepaste foam . my daughter hardly ever anymore canker sore breakouts . if she , it seems getting cold . try find toothpaste without sls ... they aren't out there . it would nice some competition bring price down more readily available . but all all , i'm glad someone made this product available , even if it pricey hard find .	1

i'm usually very skeptical person i don't trust too many things say they help you this or short amount time . but these vitamins actually work . it takes some time they pretty expensive but they work . so if you need something help your hair grow you should buy these vitamins cause amazingly they work show results . only thing i hate product price . but if you money want help growing your hair then you're luck . i'm young i don't alot money so i can't buy these vitamins all time . but if you steady cash flow then you're luck they totally help you	1

my arms used get so sore because i'd blow-dry my thick , frizzy , curly hair 1 1/2 hours then go over it again cheapy flat iron wal-mart . after stylist mastercuts use this my hair achieve even better results under half hour , i knew i buy this produc t.t his great price considering most places like trade secret , iron alone cost $129 plus tax , plus chi products $15 up . it great value , it benefits great cause , so why not ? so if you unruly , thick , curly hair- this product you ! just careful because it get really hot- i burned my ear bit . other than some common sense , anyone use it achieve great results . i tried messing it flip out my hair curl it , i've almost got it down	1
dispenser looks good , holds decent volume shampoo , conditioner etc . it simple refill bottles , so far there no leakage . mounting easy , glued onto tiles silicone glue ( included ) . if it broke or we decided replace it , we would probably struggle quite bit get it off tiles . top shelf not cross bar front , so if you mount dispenser under your shower head , hose knock over whatever you might place shelf . little hooks hold disposable razors but not ones larger heads . overall satisfied , good product price	1
it very easy use , turns very quickly , seems quite accurate . i also love there no extras required ( e.g. , ear tip covers ) . kids want their temperature taken	1
great price , good product , escellent service . i buy this supplier again	1
this product gives your hair great volume without looking greasy . ( careful not use too much ! ) it works best if you little time diffuse your hair blow dryer ! not surprisingly , when i use curl conscious many people compliment curls depth it adds my hair :) i wish it would combat frizz little more , but my hair less frizzy when i use it . i guess next thing i'll try bumble bumble frizz fighter	1

start - i miss my hair . last september i cut my hip length hair mid back , then december just shoulders , then again chin january - january through june i trimmed it regularly keep it length . ( i've getting rid henna my hair - i couldn't get it out via any other method tried except " growing out " ) . my hair grows kinda slow now too - it used grow faster , but i suppose everything slows down older you get . my last cut late june - it mid upper neck length - basically little bit longer than chin length cut , then layered . got rid really saturated henna'd hair - so i ready start growing it out . after much digging around online i came across hair 37 all reviews it - both good bad . i gave it shot - got my pills first week july started taking them . last night - maybe it wishful thinking , but i noticed difference hair length - it seemed it'd picked up little length little extra quickly - then my boyfriend commented it later day . he knows i've working go back my natural hair color - there noticeable demarcation line henna natural hair color . last night he looked me said " hey wow - you're hair really grown - i see half inch more roots ! wow - you're hair getting dark ! " i pretty pleased - not bad just 2 weeks vitamins ! i can't wait see how it 2 weeks , come august - if i 1/2 inch add it , i definitely reordering these pills ! but side note , previous reviews my own experience ... it lot pills take - but make sure you keep up them every day . i find taken stage one pill morning afternoon , then dividing up stage 2 pills into 3 doses 2 pills throughout day works very well .	1
this best affordable acne solution ive ever used . i acne my forehead acne started get smaller even acne my cheeks just disappeared next morning . box there sticker said it works faster than proactiv solution its right ! proactiv takes like 2 weeks work but this works over night . only minor thing it when you put overnight acne control lotion , it starts feeling like its harding into mask your face . it feels like its restricing muscle movement your face . its no biggy because it works it washes right off morning when im shower . i cant believe little lotion make such difference . if you looking acne solution affordable price then this exacly what you looking	1

this shaver replaced norelco advantage ( 6 years old ) shaving good but would no longer hold charge more than couple days . i can't honestly say if it shaves close blade because i haven't shaved blade many years . i used foil shavers past ( braun panasonic ) though they might shave closer than rotary cost replace foils nicks you get not worth it . i using this shaver 3 months . during time i charged it only twice including initial charge using it least every other day . first i thought it underpowered because it so quiet but soon found out it shaves much closer than my old advantage which i thought doing great job . it shaves quick close ( personally i think close blade ) . when you shaving you just rinse it under tap let it dry . it doesn't get any easier than . i cleaned heads once stated instructions easy too . only con i dry sensitive skin not seen any difference 3 comfort settings . use electric shave before shaving i think you agree it shaves close blade without irritation . highly recommended worth price .	1

i write review below review ( one i quotes ) . below reviewer states this 170 watts you need 1875 watts . i nearly fell off my seat ! not only review but how many people recommended it ! first , 100 watts average hair straighter . 170 watts excellent ! 1875 would melt your hair ! i not think it fair this person rated item without knowledge wattage . " this straightener only 170 watts heating power . not very good number ! if you want salon-straight hair you need ceramic straightener 1875 watts ... especially if you thick or very frizzy hair !	1

if you wonder why you're feeling lethargic or if you one those little abdominal paunches you thought just advancing age , then you might need probiotic therapy . you might even need it if your resistance colds low ! because we live much " cleaner " lives than our ancestors , sterilizing our dishes , putting our food fridge , spraying pesticides everything , we live our lives virtually bacteria-free . free good bacteria , . baddies seem still get us , without good ones balance them out , we're trouble . lack friendly bacteria your intestines cause problems throughout your body . put it " nice " terms , it little like backed up plumbing inside you , world just ain't gonna right until you fix it . i started probiotic therapy several months ago , i amazed following things happened almost immediately : * little stomach paunch went away . i kid you not . talk instant self-esteem booster . * my chronic [ men , cover your ears ] yeast infections decreased dramatically ( even without my eliminating wheat my diet , which i know i ought ) . * i more energy felt more like me years ago . * i became more resistant colds than i used . if you're considering supplementing your diet probiotics , you should know not all them created equal . fact , testing www.consumerlab.com indicates vast majority probiotic supplements don't deliver number live organisms they claim -- not even close ! those little creatures very delicate , things like processing , shipping , sitting your shelf kill them . let not even talk what your stomach acid them . primal defense one few supplements delivers amount probiotics it claims . ( i tell its effects me . ) addition , it contains lots good-for-you green foods also help build all-important inner strength . one very important caveat primal defense , though : because it so effective , don't even think starting out taking 3 tablets day ! not unless you don't mind lot abdominal discomfort able spend several days all yourself home . i took one day 2 months , then i finally felt ready move up 2 . it'll least month before i'm up recommended 3 . one more thing : drink lots water . you need it anyway , primal defense works best when you're well hydrated	1

i wanted cordless shaver because my age ( 49 ) i need my glasses see hairs i'm shaving , doesn't work well shower ! this braun good buy , easy use , works well if you follow directions shave slowly . it not close or smooth blade shaving gel , but it quicker less mess , so i think it good trade-off .	1
most reviewers this site unenthusiastic this particular product . i think main reason level dissatisfaction , someone else suggested , people need pay attention how , exactly , this trimmer works . because its design , best results obtained when it inserted , withdrawn , then inserted again , procedure repeated . second tip : rinse rotating blade , switched , under hot tap remove accumulated hair , etc , after each use . it works better when clean . main plus this product its size . yes , it flimsy , made china , would probably sell $2.50 if it didn't say panasonic it - or come 12-month panasonic warranty . but it works very well if you use it right keep it clean . i mine couple years only problem blade now dull replacement blades apparently not available	1

this contains 16 servings , which means it last you half month . that pretty expensive when you break price down serving whne compared 1 month supply flax capsules costs $7 . however , liquid flax oil lot more concentrated than pills you buy store . flax oil pill typically contains 1000mg flaxseed oil suggested dosage 2-3 times day . so pills you're getting 2-3g flax oil day . liquid flax oil , you're getting 14g flax . if you buying this it purported treatment acne , sunburn , diverticular disorders , hemorrhoids , more serious health conerns , it probably best consume liquid flax oil . if you just want benefits lower cholesterol heart disease prevention , pill few times day , combined fish oil should all you need . it definitely easier though take spoonful this morning than 3 flax pills day , when you loook value , you're getting 224g flax oil this bottle when compared typical 100g 100 pill bottle capsules . it all depends what you need it	1
i'm black male everytime i would shave normally i would get irritated skin ingrown hairs . first i'd feel little itch throughout day end day i'd see these tiny little bumps white heads ( 10-20 them ) . before . now after i apply product i don't itch nor tiny bumps come up anymore . it just feels like i never any hair my face first place . only bad thing this product it burns slightly but i don't really care i mean it not like product claims painless .	1

used this product myself many years when particapating ultra endurance cycling events , well my family when vacationing tropical area where sun cook you quickly without adequate sun protection . not fooled thinking you not get tanned using spf 45 or better . misconception ... why not walk away your experience sun without discomfort sun poisoning . found best result when put indoors prior sun .	1
i cannot say how well this product really compares other sunscreens terms sun protection . but it right ingredients most top-rated sunscreens/sunblocks use , so it should least par them . where this product really shines ( or doesn't shine ) people combination/oily skin . i tried many sunscreens , it so hard find sunscreen without moisturizers ( if you oily skin , that already your natural moisturizers ) . i even tried other neutrogena sunscreens supposed oil free all . result my face ? after applying it , i always shine ( which not what i want ) . this magnificent product , however , actually gives my face nice matte finish ... matte feel , too ! it pretty thick cream when you first apply it ( opposed other suncreens or other products feel more like lotion ) , but almost immediately absorbed skin . 30 seconds , there no more greasy/creamy feeling , one minute , if you feel your skin , there nice matte feel . however , this not fault product , after 3 hours ( least me ) , then i feel like matte effect worn off , my oily skin again showing its oily nature . still , far suncreens go , this best i tried my skin , i highly recommend it people combination/oily skin . btw , this review actual product i got , which spf 30 . time i am writing this review , here amazon they also offer spf 45 version , cheaper , too ! i don't know difference , but i always go lower one ( this case , spf 30 ) , because i theorize -- rightly or wrongly , i don't know -- lesser spf , lesser strength ingredients , so maybe it better sensitive skin (?)	1

i'm writing correct few factual errors other reviews . one reviewer claimed soldier fuel contains no energy ingredients . this untrue . soldier fuel formulated military labs specifically provide steady energy troops . carbohydrates body primary source energy . soldier fuel contains 29 complex carbs ( carbs give long-lasting energy ) 12 sugar . u.s. military labs deemed this perfect ratio give you both quick burst energy no crash . most other energy drinks market lots sugar caffeine . since caffeine stimulant not source energy , result quick spike energy followed crash . error soldier fuel more sugar . it less . one 12 oz . soldier fuel 12 sugar . same amount gatorade contains 21 sugar . same amount red bull 39g sugar . finally , support troops not marketing hype . our company partnered u.s. military natick soldier center . portion gross proceeds each hooah ! soldier fuel each hooah ! bar directly funds research improves safety , diet , quality life our troops	1

i finally received this product mail after knowing it year . i can't say i'm huge fan deepak chopra . he presents some good ideas , but what i tell he seems consider meditation more mechanism mind body control , leading bliss relaxation , rather than tool unbiased self knowledge , come terms all things one rather might ignore . i find this bias reflected game . game itself , it pretty good - its graphics its originality - learning relax chill out may useful some people . i didn't find process compelling i expected , though . i found i able learn some skills pretty fast , other places i seemed get stuck . one potential drawback if you get frustrated , try start forcing things happen , it defeat purpose meditation . science biofeedback fairly new , i see its potential field preventative health . i just wouldn't put same new age spin things chopra .	1

this review oral-b flexisoft replacement heads . coupled braun electric toothbrushes , this one most effective aids oral hygiene ever developed . my introduction oral-b goes back over 27 years usaf basic training briefing ; dental technician held up oral-b toothbrush medium bristles said " this toothbrush you need if you want keep your teeth " or some such statement like . well , i haven't lost one yet . motorized mechanicals toothbrush most work while you guide oscillating round head around over your pearly whites . while heads undeniably pricey when looked just dollars cents , there value fact total package actually makes rather mundane chore little more fun while actually living up claim it better job your teeth than manual brushing . since i've always believed entire surface area toothbrush head meant covered toothpaste size head these smaller than average brush , i know i'm using less toothpaste same job . while this no big deal , long term economic benefit plaque under control , healthy gums bright smile full natural teeth . it kind hard deny it works since my dentist confirmed positive results upon direct examination . just careful what model these brush heads you selecting watch pricing . oral-b uses kind color code bristles , ones colored indicator bristles line shaft flexisoft model seems equate medium hardness . enjoy life	1
i love these because they're delicious just thing getting me through long workout . they're also perfect traveling , easy pack , sustain you during all day hike or touristy walkabout . friend mine iraq says he eats them twice day , taste , also because -- i agree -- he trusts energy product designed military soldiers much more than energy product designed private company profit	1
i used this toothbrush 2 months now , so while i cannot really comment subjects like longevity or reliability , i say it functions perfectly . firstly , it cleans teeth gums so much better than manual toothbrushes , or my one previous electric ( bausch lomb interplak ) . experiment i tried you duplicate ( if you any interest ): eat " problem " food usually leaves bits stuck your teeth . me , this means blueberries ( skins ) or tuna . brush your manual brush . then rinse spit several times , until no more debris coming out . now floss throughly then rinse spit several times again . how much more debris you get now ? this what your toothbrush not get . now try it again oral . oral brush , my mouth feels much cleaner , i end up much less food left floss get . i chose 7550 because i wanted oral " 3d brushing action " mechanism lowest price , when i looked various models sale , it seemed major difference them ( not just gimmicks ) number types brush heads included each model . i figured since these expendables , i would buying more them over years anyway . end , 7550 four brush heads included 6 refills i bought same time cost less than some fancier models fewer heads . build-quality seems first-rate , action combines oscillation in-and-out pulsations very effective , my teeth thanking me	1
this nice easy use toothbrush . lots power holds charge pretty good . best way use let battery drain down before recharging . after maybe five days use , twice day , you feel battery need recharged maximum power . i like fact it only two-minute timer not turn off after two minutes . i don't need toothbrush too many bells whistles . only annoying thing some would blue recharge indicator light stays while charging . i use like night light those middle night bathroom excursions . no more blinded turning light	1
life good batteries work way they supposed work . good value	1
once , i don't " public service " going clifbar.com looking up ingredients nutritional information ; amazon.com it all top product page . now , i focus taste!that good thing , because this ( clif z-bar , chocolate ) one better tasting " nutritional " snacks its kind . it just enough chocolate ( brought you chocolate chips ( which include organic cane juice , unsweetened chocolate , cocoa butter , unspecified " natural flavors " ) actually impart chocolate flavor . not heavy or rich chocolate flavor , but unmistakable one : you don't close your eyes , convince yourself it chocolate . ( ever notice how permeable artificial flavors ? let say you're eating popsicle -- excuse me -- frozen fruit treat . you close your eyes , flavor clues all but gone . think purple , its tastes like grape ; think orange , it orange , think light blue it bubble gum -- if you know code , . ) this like giant bit-o-honey candy , it chewy texture over laden honey , some sticky peanut butter chocolate thrown , you've pretty much captured flavor . my surprise , there no honey , taste derives somehow syrups , malt , cane juice , fig paste , other sweet ingredients . it definitely filling , especially if accompanied apple or something , least eight ounces water . it very chewy , yet it doesn't seem dry similar products . could it six grams fa t-t wo which saturated ? yes , two grams saturated fat ! not good . i'll try balance fact it made 70% organic ingredients , whopping 11 grams protein , only 20 grams sugar ( compare other brands flavors ) , includes five grams fiber . clif z-bar excellent clif apple raisin walnut , this one better tasting its kind -- just don't expect brownie	1
best sports bar around . great taste , organic , contains plenty antioxidants , contains good amount protein . only down side high amount carbs , especially sugars , but i still give it five stars	1
i eat one these twice week before i play ice hockey . i specifically buy this flavor because it contains caffeine , though i don't perceive any " boost " . it could there i'm just not noticing it . i feel they job keeping me fueled workout . it would nice if package made specific recommendation how long before workout eat clif bar . i find size clif bar bit disappointing , especially considering " store " price $1.50 . $11 case free shipping when spending $25 or more , i've not found better price than amazon clif bars	1
after trying many pre-shaving products i found this best one . only problem it hard find , when i i usually buy several	1

if you looking new ways incorporate soy products into your life , clif bars one best tasting energy bars market . i've given up trying other bars mostly disappointingly filled all sorts oils i can't eat . take cottonseed example it everything ! not mention , peanut butter all palm kernel oil saturating health bar market . ingredients carrot cake bar : organic brown rice syrup , soy protein isolate , rice flour , malt extract , organic soy flour , organic roasted soybeans , organic rolled oats , organic evaporated cane juice , organic dried apples , cocoa butter , soy lecithin , natural flavors , apple fiber , oat fiber , organic milled flaxseed , chicory extract , psyllium , organic soy butter , dried carrots , raisins , coconut , sea salt , nutmeg , cinnamon cloves . each bar 240 calories delicious breakfast cup tea . i eat clif bar almost every morning never really feel overly hungry during day . gary ( owner clif bar inc . ) seems also found out " other " energy bars not really tasty . after his " epiphany , " he spent lots time his mom kitchen working making cliff bars . what guy ! i point where i trying make my own granola bars , but after discovering these bars , i'm hooked . they portable , delicious basically , i love all flavors . you take them biking , hiking , walking , anywhere . this bar especially delicious i seem fall love it again each october . must spices creamy white chocolate chips . there just enough chocolate chips remind you cream cheese icing . if i choose piece carrot cake one these bars , bar would win . also look cranberry apple cherry bars pumpkin spice bars . ~ therebeccareview.com	1
if you burn lots calories your activities , this high energy food could give you lift . there 250 calories packed into this little 2.4 ounce bar , which advertised least 70% organic . this bar advertised athletes first , casual snack second . if you overweight trying drop pounds , you skip this snack move back unbuttered popcorn . when i opened this bar i noticed it looks like compressed goop . however , compressed goop tastes pretty good . texture much like granola bar , though more moist than granola bar . black cherry part black cherry almond understated . there dried cherries this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor , which big plus . i unable find anything this bar implied it artificial , which even bigger plus . one thing confused me little bar advertised no wheat no dairy , but label bar states there may trace amounts dairy . i guess they either knew there might very small amount dairy or they hedging themselves because possible cross-contamination some other process . either case , vegens consider whether trace amounts dairy makes this acceptable product . label also states there may traces peanuts . this bar also contains 20% daily recommended dietary fiber , which means drinking lots water good idea when eating this bar . there also lots vitamins trace elements , which may good thing unless you take vitamin supplements , which case you may need consider whether you getting too much good thing . clif bars could casual snack , but ingredients their marketing really suggest they geared toward individuals looking healthy energy boost high energy activities . if you fall into category , which could include hiking , climbing , bicycling , running , jogging , other similarly strenuous activities , then this bar could good way packing big punch small package . enjoy !	1

scale indeed looks very nice sleek its glass design . quality seems quite nice , it designed england . there 10 year warranty case anything goes wrong . scale very accurate , but i agree others tapping issue . i more like " hit " it my foot get it started . make sure you wait until 18888 turns 0 before stepping . 18888 means it calibrating scale 0 . you keep very still weight stabilize . or else it just keep going up down , although you'll able get your weight within half pound before number stabilizes	1
while i'm big fan hooah bars , this particular flavor tastes like apple jolly ranchers . no kidding . if that okay you , then go apple flavor . i'd recommend chocolate	1
when i go out nights i meet lot people . i like centre attention , which means i louder more fun than dj , music , flashing lights everyone else places i go . its lot fun but drains my energy . i often find myself crashing half way through night . i run out steam , feeling hungry , dizzy ( worst all ) i loose my spark . only thing then leave grab bite eat . typically i feel bloated sleepy then . so i'll often call it night . fun over - which sucks ! i needed different way things . i experimented candy bars , oatmeal bars energy bars . none them worked - they just delayed crash little . hooah bar last one i tried . i say it last one , because once i tried this i realised i didn't need anything else . i tried it out my birthday . i admit whole " developped military " thing made me curious . but after failing all other bars i didn't high hopes . i took two bars me night . around midnight familiar signs i depleted my energy stores started showing : i felt little dizzy , i got few hot cold flushes , my stomach felt like it going eat itself soon . thing i far too good time leave ( i party 7 people hanging my every word - something which tremendous things boosting old ego ! ) instead bailing - i might , i just popped open hooah bar ate it i carried . within minutes my hunger pangs disappeared , my blood sugar levels balanced out i felt back form . best thing i didn't feel bloated or tired afterwards . it exactly what i needed . i know i taking hooah bar me every time i go out now	1
i encountered these last week carlsbad triathlon . they tasted really good i figured if it good enough military , i'll give it try ... sure enough , military knows what it doing -- it seems work claimed . thumbs up , or , hooah	1
while i am not sure what exactly these taste like , i don't detect peanut butter here . texture good , chewy enough , but taste ... odd . not all sweet . i can't imagine any child ( or adult ) grown accustomed high fructose corn syrup actually enjoying these . bleh . if you want peanut butter , clif bar much better flavor ( even denser , chewier texture ) . if you want z-bar , i slightly recommend chocolate -- although it too tastes bit odd inferior chocolate clif bars . builder bars also worth try , sufficiently sweet flavorful . course , these alternative product lines you get twice calories . although i not buy these again , i give company star worthy effort	1
clif bars great- my only concern it seems like there lot more packaging then necessary product shipped . thanks .	1
my beard hairs extremely curly i struggled ingrown hairs razor bumps ever since junior high . i never liked way i looked beard i always wanted clean shaven , but my curly hair didn't allow me shave more than once week or so . if i shaved more often , ingrowns bumps would go out control . it , only shaving once week still gave me huge problems . i resigned myself always looking scruffy . until i found this shaver . instead cutting hair beneath skin level ( where it cause bumps since it curl grown beneath skin ) , this razor cuts hairs just above skin . what this mean me ? first time 14 years , i am able shave whenever i want . my ingrowns completely disappeared . i feel like new person i love looking clean-cut . thank you remington	1
outstanding quality , consistency accuracy ! end day all you ask blood pressure cuff ( sphygmomanometer ) . few things bear mind : consecutive readings same time , you see trend higher lower blood pressure you " learn " lower your own pressure . also , your blood pressure home lower than you obtain your doctor office until you learn overcome anxiety normally associated doctor office . this normal one main reasons obtain home blood pressure monitor . also , your pressure fluctuate day day even during blood pressure monitoring session . so don't automatically assume gauge not giving accurate readings ! trust me , it . this monitor extensively tested against measurements obtained doctor office determined accurate method determining blood pressure you would obtain doctor office - actually , more accurate since anxiety factor eliminated . so if you looking best home blood monitor device market look no further . just made sure trust it ! i heartily endorse this product	1

i heard this product through friend i skeptical first . i usually don't mind diet food or drinks taste bad but first taste this i not like it ! me it tasted like someone sprayed inside bottle pledge then put water it . it may taste you either like or don't like . i am one who not like it , but i came up idea add crystal lite ( go packs lemonade or raspberry lemonade my favorite ) it so good ! it adds 5 calories but it worth it ! i still get hungary but i find myself getting full fast not even finishing meal . it may my head but if it works i dont mind ! also i buy mine target when i run out .	1
i very dissapointed my purchase , citrus taste water absolutely terrible i just could not drink it , so there whole case sitting unused my porch . waste money	-1
i think this product very good . once you've glanced user manual it easy use . you store several profiles it so every member your family quickly use it . only thing i wish it would it doesn't save previous results . this very handy tool keeping track your weight loss progress . you'll idea how your body composition chaning your weight	1
this well-made device useful , though limited , value . it usefulness derives its consistency , which amazing . given your body composition varies throughout day , particularly your level hydration , omron measurements vary only fractions percent - exactly what you would expect . it measures small electric currents running one electrode , through your body , second electrode . omron programmed estimate your body fat measuring impedance your body flow electricity . so , one might think such measurement would straightforward , like weight scale . electricity encounters fat , muscle , bone , fluids omron interprets current displays your body fat percent . right ? after all , when you step scale , scale responds showing your weight . you don't need tell scale whether you think you athlete or how old you . it simply measures your weight . well , omron doesn't work way , nor other similar devices , nor skin-fold calipers . it looks me though electrical skin-fold devices all simply measure surface body fat . then they require you input other data , such your activity level ( " normal " or " athlete " omron case ) age . this not good because it introduces general population averages into what should specific measurements you . instance , regardless your body , it assumed older you , more internal fat you . resulting body fat estimates dramatically different when factoring those variables . omron ( calipers ) still useful , though , if you consider it compass rather than scale . you can't sure it tell you where you , but , over time , it tell you where you going .	1
i've using omron hbf-306 body fat analyzer month or so now . so far i've very impressed its consistency . however , i would go doctor get some sort analysis compare omron measurements see how accurate it . it well built very easy use . once you set up your profile , it only takes few seconds get read . i would give it 5 stars but again i dont yet anything compare its measurements . still good product good price .	1
i bought this gadget intent monitoring my daily steps get idea where i currently establish some sort baseline so i could get reality check my activity levels . i opened box , read easy directions , set up my personal step measurement ( just measure off distance your 10 steps ) , clipped it my pants forgot it day . i surprised find out corpse could probably move around more during day than me ! over next 6 days , ( this pedometer keeps track 7 days steps you ); i literally stepped up my game went 756 steps no aerobic exercise day 1 , 7,880 steps 30 minutes nonstop aerobic exercise day 3 ! every day getting easier achieve 10,000 " normal " steps , increasing aerobic steps too ( which tracked separately ) . i press mode button , check out how many miles my steps translate , kilocalories burned , aerobic steps , compare it past 7 days well . it turned out even more fun than what i originally bought it . i actually feel better , fun part i am trying beat my own personal record previous day ! this eye-opening experience me , i keep this or my pocket all time now , just make sure i keep mindful eye my steps aerobic activity day	1
this pedometer accurate you could reasonably expect . features suitable it even looks good . only problem i this product minor , it why i gave item 4 stars , rather than 5 . plastic holder/belt clip comes pedometer cheaply made very puny little spring . if you don't plan using belt clip , this definitely 5 star item . otherwise , just treat holder gently hopefully it last longer than mine , because omron won't sell holder seperately . holder only weakness speak if omron redesigns it , this 5 stars across board ( record , i wouldn't let my opinion holder stop me buying one . i'd make same suggestion anyone who fence - buy it .	1
mother two children , one special needs this product must . it allows me easily keep track all medical events . it particularly useful when visiting doctor first time i easily provide summary my child medical history . no more guessing ! when my children grown they record their medical history . this particulary useful child complex medical history . it very user friendly tool . i highly recommend this product .	1

i used this toothbrush 2 months now , so while i cannot really comment subjects like longevity or reliability , i say it functions perfectly . firstly , it cleans teeth gums so much better than manual toothbrushes , or my one previous electric ( bausch lomb interplak ) . experiment i tried you duplicate ( if you any interest ): eat " problem " food usually leaves bits stuck your teeth . me , this means blueberries ( skins ) or tuna . brush your manual brush . then rinse spit several times , until no more debris coming out . now floss throughly then rinse spit several times again . how much more debris you get now ? this what your toothbrush not get . now try it again oral . oral brush , my mouth feels much cleaner , i end up much less food left floss get . i chose 7550 because i wanted oral " 3d brushing action " mechanism lowest price , when i looked various models sale , it seemed major difference them ( not just gimmicks ) number types brush heads included each model . i figured since these expendables , i would buying more them over years anyway . end , 7550 four brush heads included 6 refills i bought same time cost less than some fancier models fewer heads . build-quality seems first-rate , action combines oscillation in-and-out pulsations very effective , my teeth thanking me	1
this nice easy use toothbrush . lots power holds charge pretty good . best way use let battery drain down before recharging . after maybe five days use , twice day , you feel battery need recharged maximum power . i like fact it only two-minute timer not turn off after two minutes . i don't need toothbrush too many bells whistles . only annoying thing some would blue recharge indicator light stays while charging . i use like night light those middle night bathroom excursions . no more blinded turning light	1
this got one easiest blood pressure monitors use . it really doesn't start until your arm correct position , letting you know beeping when you've got it right . display large easy read understand . i definitely would recommend this	1
i compared this body fat monitor similar ones tanita . you definately getting more your money here . it stores up 4 users where tanita models only store 2 compares function function elsewhere lower price point . not mention this scale just feels like better quality when you pick it up . i bought one one omron pedometers take advantage instant rebate amazon . ( i haven't seen event tanita amazon while . ) pedometer #1 rated cr . they both top notch products	1
this blood pressure monitor everything i looking price certainly right . thank you . it works perfectly	1
i'm cursed sensitive skin tough beard . i'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated , so i carefully prep shaving . after years trial error , i've finally settled good shaving cream system : cetaphil skin cleanser base , then kiss my face moisture shave supplement . post-shave comfort prevent breakouts , i use product like cleanclear dual-action oil-free moisturizing lotion . however , weak link up until now actual shaver . gillette fusion power , i've finally found right one . i've used gillette since they gave my unit free razors during first gulf war ( i marines time ) . they've gotten job , but 3-blade system ultimately inadequate my beard skin type . it doesn't take long blades start cutting my face neck , especially since i take forever change blades . i dreaded looking bathroom mirror work seeing dried blood spots ( not mention getting blood stains my collar ) . electric shavers don't work me either - too hard my skin , i'd five-o'clock shadow around 2pm . so , when i saw gillette touting their new 5-blade system , i gave it shot . i initially skeptical powered aspect due my issues electric shavers . but fusion power happy exception . first i struggled bit getting battery cap off end . but once i mastered maneuver got battery , i set . it takes one aaa-battery seems last decent interval ( low-battery indicator nice touch ) . even if fusion power runs out juice , you still shave it . shaver glides over my face , vibration feels good - kind like pick-me-up morning . five blades really nail my beard , even tough spots like my chin jaw line remain cut-free . i also like one-blade trimmer top - very handy evening out my sideburns zapping those stray whiskers right under my nostrils . my only issue expense blades . but i make them last lot longer than old 3-blade razors while still getting great shave . most importantly , i rarely get those annoying cuts anymore ( if i , it more because rushing or clumsiness than anything else ) . ultimately , result worth higher price . gillette fusion power best shaver i've ever tried . highly recommended	1
i use this product my son my wife i just love it . we no buy any othe product but this one . unless we run out without placing order ..... but it easy enough him pull it down then pull it back up when he finished . very convenient	1
price ... you can't beat rayovac . blow away those cheap " heavy duty " batteries last almost or just long premium brands . amazon price seems like it best other than wal-mart ... who priced same or just little lower . well worth spend !	1
clif bars amoung best tasting energy bars i ever tried . they may not pack many calories or grams protein other brands , but there times where i could not even finish competeing bar because dismal taste or texture	1
i've tried many types nutrition bars many too sweet or they not tasty . clif bars get it right	1
i purchased several them it burn free rash free , easy apply you not use your fingers etc apply it , one sticks lasts lasts . it really makes shaving joy , not chore , i just love using it you too . it far best best pre-shave product market	1
i so excited this product ; but when i got it i deeply dissatisfied . box damaged . it bent inward lid one side around drawers opening it ripped both sides . i returning this product replacement . i think box really cute . however if i receive damaged box then i never buy thing this website	-1
cutest keepsake box . flip-top lid which perfectly fits matching record book , two drawers below , one which divided into sections smaller keepsakes . bottom drawer good size store matching photo album too . lid frame you place picture your little one , says " thank heaven little girls " all around frame . excellent value , it very sturdy	1
clif bars make tasty pleasant snack . they perfect when you simply don't lot time get something into you keep you going . [ ... ] they excellent source vitamins . they very chewy satisfying ; you won't need more than one or two before you workout . they much more nutritious than candy bar , too . however , this snack bar not perfect . reviewer notes , there quite bit sugar , carbohydrates fat each bar . this food bar not anyone salt free diet it contains salt ; people allergies any kind nuts should definitely not eat this food . overall , clif nutrition bars useful those us who not allergic any their ingredients who want healthier alternative candy bar . amazon price makes them affordable i recommend them delicious snack food .	1
i saw this few days ago it source circuit city ... definitley worth money ! it repairs scratches saved all dvds i used it . so there no other repair kit ... buy it today , if you see it	1
very good protein bar . cookies cream very tasty , yet it not too sweet . i find builder bar one big advantage over regular clif bar ( other than protein course ): builder bar isn't super sweet . i really enjoy regular clif bar but sometimes it leaves me feeling like i just ate really sweet candy bar . builder bar doesn't suffer . downside builder bar , however , it bit saturated fat . sum , not bad bar much tastier than many other protein bars i tried	1
i bought these because i love regular clif bars . i ride my bike to/from work , so i thought i would use these kind " breakfast replacement " . they taste very good they definitely hold you over until lunch . although , i highly recommend glass cold milk handy wash it down	1
i'm giving this ' 4 ' because my husband likes them took them me use after his weight lifting work-outs . but i tried one first : outside chocolate bit crumbly probably due shipping storage . taste fair real good high protein bar doesn't use lot sugar alcohols sweeten it , depending your taste such things . other words it not super-sweet but sucralose ( splenda ) gets job , if i remember correctly . it super keeping you getting hungry due fact it real carbs , not play carbs it , match it high amount protein - probably could used zone diet . you last hours hours it . it more than meal . ( this not dieter bar , although careful planning could used such . ) we've tried lot bars this best high protein bar yet doesn't rely sugar alcohols ( otherwise , stick south beach diet bars .	1
graet consumers who want get more protein their diets without sacrifice benefits all-natural ingredients or great taste . truly works	1

i purchased this towel gym use after older microfiber towel finally wore out after several years , after couple months use , it very good purchase . it doesn't same loops one used regular terry-cloth towels , but it very , very soft absorbant , since first time i used it . ( cleaning instructions say not use fabric softener , i don't . ) it dries very quickly , so it ideal gym use . unlike cotton towels , it doesn't get nasty odor sometimes happens . size extremely generous , but it also fits easily gym bag when folded . one probably wouldn't want use it home place regular terry-cloth towels , but you certainly could . it would also make good purchase college students dorms , since it dries quickly , even when hanging	1

much more convenient than conventional mop , but end , it still mopping . i don't know if i would describe it " fun " some other reviewers , but it definitely less chore than old mop bucket method . it gets floor pretty clean . i only hardwood floors my house , so i used hardwood cleaner this , sometimes it leaves residue . overall , it okay	1
it good thing , step up previous mopping systems . it could if i understood all features better i would get better results . if it came booklet explaining it , then my wife must put someplace weird because i never saw it . i never would thought mop would require instruction booklet , but it . really bad stains still scrubbed hands knees style , which i hoped this would eliminate . i like it though . maybe couple years there something further evolved these lines really best i imagine .	1

( they still ? ) there time ( many years ago ) when i too bashful pick it up grocery store my mother . but times changed ... so my review : scott tissue long favorite my family because it tough enough get job while still remaining soft gentle . i like fact there so many sheets one roll which makes it last longer , meaniing fewer trips store . i can't see purchasing this through mail , though , because it too bulky . but it great product !!!	1

i've through 4 or 5 portable oral irrigators past ten years . first ones i bought panasonic quite weak ceased work within year or so - changing batteries didn't help ! so i discarded them went hand pump kind , but when broke i went back panasonic - this model works better than their original model . pulse stronger , it easy fill , hasn't died me yet . so i'm hopeful it'll last more than year !	1
after 3 months daily use , this nifty little device keeps pumping ! my wife wouldn't let me take over tiny bathroom counter traditional counter-top style water irrigator . addition space , dangling cord would pain . this portable panasonic device tucks into my medicine cabinet . it takes 10 seconds get ready it works well counter-top device . yeah , okay , you change batteries once month . no big deal . it small portable it works . highly recommended !	1

i lingering cold / sore throat symptoms once couple years ago i bought these healthy food store try them out . turns out they just best lozenges i've ever tried . they work exceptionally , taste great last long time . very soothingto honest , i don't like effervescent " airborne " . it too inconvenient use too expensive . too bad store i went stopped carrying these lozenges , because i won't buy fizzy kind . really glad i found them amazon , even shipping they're good deal . buy 4 boxes , you'll need them they last least year so no worries if you think they'll go bad . if you're teacher or kids trust me you'll need them even more . only drawback i found these foil packaging inside isn't resealable , though you fold it over they stay almost fresh . lozenges assorted fruit , but packages i got almost all ' grape ' inside . i would prefer more cherry , orange , lemon . but other than , these rock . they don't sell these target , despite what you read other reviews . buy them	1
if it would possible give this product 0 or even below zero stars , i would . i tried shorten my beard trimmer today only thing it pluck out some hair stop when more there more than 4 hairs cut once . i not even try battery powered second option , because those usually worse than ones outlet . anyway , i would never buy this product , because even $19 too much this	-1
well i don't think there really much you say clipper set , there ? i'm loyal wahls this good deal . it shaves pretty well though i find i go back over areas time or two make sure i get it all same length . i think it may way guard not fault clipper itself . i've it maybe month now it kept up well four or so times i've shaved my head since . little trimmer comes it pretty nice powerful running aa batteries . it trimmed down my facial hair cleaned up my neck very fast when my old trimmer took some pressing few passes . i only two minor complaints actual product itself . it gets really warm after 10-15 minutes . normally this might not big deal but if you big head like i make sure you get it all properly it start get too hot want use . other thing it isn't too great no guard shaving . now granted i only tried it once but it wasn't catching everything when i try . it could i just holding it wrong angle get it , which easy mirror , but i thought it worth noting just incase . i think it may need guards guide hair better . also , something kind odd nasty , amazon sent me open used one . now $15 i wasn't going bother returning it or complaining . i just cleaned it off some alcohol wipes got rid left over hair(yuck ! ) it good go but it really worth stating because i think i would got something else if i'd known i would get used one	1

i one these food mills when my children toddlers so i very happy find this my grandchildren . it makes great baby shower gift .	1
i really didn't think this thing going work ... but when you acne most your life you try anything any cost . i found using zeno conjunction proactive solution i cleared my face significantly acne . zeno product take some time use , you hold it pimple approx . two minutes . it causes redness area 10 minutes only mildly uncomfortable when you first put it pimple . after day or two acne gone . it weird , but it works ! i only gave it 4 stars because two minutes you hold it your face , redness , mild discomfort heat . other than , it quite easy use requires no clean up . you just charge it periodically after 90 uses you replace tip . replacing it so simple . you literally just pull old one off snap new one . this very simple device it trick . it not work very well all cystic ance , but basic zits or pimples it takes care them day or two .	1
i always trouble curling my hair , when i get my hair curl it doesn't last very long . these , curls soft , lasted all day ! very easy use , work well , great buy	1

i just received my itouchless 22gal trashcan . there huge dent side above where bottom shipping styrofoam ended . i able pop dent back out turn it so it faces cabinet so hopefully nobody see two small dimples remain . i tried 33gallon trashbag which seems nice fit - ample extra room . there inner ring which holds trashbag place so even if you put small bag won't reach bottom , it looks like you should covered - least up like 10-20lbs probably . aut o-o pen mechanism works great , just put your trashcan spot away passing traffic or you probably wear your ( 4 d-type ) batteries out quickly . it makes bit gear noise when it opens closes but not too bad . i surprised it offered ac adapter , great . i wish there option when i ordered it add one my order , would even better . i probably head out radioshack pick up one those universal adapters - no problem . other thing think would using rechargeable batteries well . i mention it huge ? i guess i didn't really understand how big 22gal trashcan going . it like tall counters kitchen probably 12-15 " diameter . i think if you took large pizza box folded it half , this thing would swallow it - no problem	1

best product i've ever found taming my wavy/curly , fly-away hair , without straighten it . i just put dollop after washing , blow-dry roots then let it . works humid dry conditions . extra body , finger curl locks while wet	1
i must say i skeptical this , but low price versus department store cosmetics , figured it worth try . amazingly , it really works quite well my wife loves it ! after few weeks , people commenting she looked less tired , asked if she lost weight , exercising or vacation . since it works gradually over few weeks , you notice bit difference yourself , but people who don't see you often really notice dramatic change . smaller wrinkles smoothed out disappear completely , while large ones get smaller . it won't make 69 year old look 20 , but definitely takes off decade wear tear	1
i've this hair dryer two years pretty pleased its performance . , i pleased it until yesterday . i drying my hair usual when it briefly stopped working then huge sparks shot out it ! after flinging it across room unplugging it , i looked cause . way cord attaches unit faulty easily damaged . this poor design could lead some serious injuries . please think twice before buying this dryer	-1

easy use . quality construction . position device wrist relative heart critical . once proper positioning established used consistently , this unit performs well	1
like all wrist monitors , it must used carefully get accurate reading . it also tends read few points below arm cuff when used directed . like all wrist cuffs , it supposed held heart , or armpit level . however , me , gives consistently lower reading than arm cuff ... few points . compensate i hold it lower down , 8 12 inches . then it consistent arm cuffs i also use . it also tends deflate bit more quickly than i think good best accuracy . big flaw , one it shares prevention ds-1902pv arm cuff , while it claims detect irreglar heartbeat , , it not store info memory bp pulse , time date . if info useful detect then it should useful record , what i assumed it would . i think bit misrepresentation product . i am also not happy way information must displayed copying . it cumbersome system , if you not quick enough display defaults then record , say number 24 , must found again , requiring 24 button presses . otherwise it what it claims , very handy portable unit	1
if you buy them individually , they less than $1 . i know it seems silly , but i absolutely loe these nail clippers . they fit my hand well , they stayed sharp enought cut not pull long time , they tiny enought littlest nails . even if you don't get this whole kit , buy safest 1st nail clippers	1
i used everything this so far , except tooth brush my son only two months old . after i use nail clippers i file his nails so he wil not get this face . sug , clip babies nails while he sleeping	1
these scales work good unless you take diurectic regularly . if so , it won't able give you fat water content	1
i never owned scale reads same when you step , off back again ! talk accurate ! it very easy program , too . this scale helped motivate me lose 15 lbs 2 1/2 months ! sometimes i see i haven't lost weight , but lost body fat this huge motivation keep going !	1
these glass fantastic ! when you doing close work using both hands , you never re-position glasses because they've moved or started slide off your nose . i wear tri-focals i need use very lower part my glasses close work . there never enough " close magnification " or " focal position " raised high enough me look straight or upward through these lenses adequately see . clic solved my problem ! they adjustable , durable , comfortable , very cool looking , everyone calls them my " csi " glasses , they all want them . definitely great purchase all way around . i highly recommend them plan purchase additional clics	1
these readers opened new world me ....... real conversation piece . previous reviews stated , you don't lose your glasses . my glasses arrived time take me vacation . but i disappointed pictures taken me ..... hair around above my ears stuck out . consequently , i ceased using them until i my hair trimmed again . otherwise , i very pleased them .	1
these great scales . they very helpful our family four tracking our weight body fat . hydration nice too . i would definitely recommend these anyone ! unlike many scales , you get this twice row get exact same reading . very accurate!it nice see how many calories you eat each day maintain your weight .	1
excellent choice office use . i would suggest this pen everyone who looking buy quality writing device office use	1
i surveyed prices felt this good price quality product .	1
i purchased this unit replace 12 year old waterpic . this unit much quieter it design makes it much easier clean store . rounded surfaces reservoir dry easier protects whole unit dust when stored	1
i horrible scales , but so many sayin this one not work , well i am here say they wrong . least me anyhow , it works very efficiently , gives every time i am it accurate clear readings my weight loss , etc . i am goin clearly recommend this great scale , this reasonably low price i say go buy it ! i even called customer service back this conair ww scale , they are/were so friendly helpful how use how set it etc . love it , absolutely no complaints !!! five(5)stars sure ! adios ! [ ... ]	1
good scale nothing bad say it . lite weight which nice	1
i think scale great , except depending where you put your feet weight could off pound or two . some people might their entire week weightloss . so i suggest placing your feet same exact place each time you weight yourself . ( maybe make feet marks ??	1
it ink . what more there say ? it just lot ink reasonable price , if you like black ink , i highly recommend you use this ink your fountain pen . this package contains four glass bottles individual boxes , each bottle capped stout plastic lid seal . those who may wonder if cross ink work mont blanc pen ( hey , don't laugh , i see it legitimate question if someone isn't familiar fountain pens , ) answer -- unless mont blanc pens somehow special -- yes , since all fountain pens just reservoirs finely tuned leaks . quality ink quality company work any them . one thing aware : if you've never used fountain pen before , aware unlike other types ink , fountain pen ink not all waterproof . least , i've never seen waterproof fountain pen ink ; i imagine it clogging pens very effectively . not you should taking your notebook swimming pool , but aware ink run if water touches page it written	1
overall , i'm very happy this product . it adds attractive , modern look my kitchen larger capacity adds convenience not needing change bag every other day . automatic opener mechanism bit too sensitive -- often opens just walking nearby -- but it pretty much works described . i would recommend this product others considering automated trashcan	1
my beard like wire brush shaving like ... well shaving wire brush . thus far i couldn't happier i buy these again	1
great product , i nothing more then great words say this product	1
i've very happy mach iii past few years -- but then fusion razor cartridge came mail i figured i'd give it try . i'm probably good one test razors ... see my photograph -- not only i shave my face , ( though i typically goatee ) , but i also shave my entire head well . i've using same fusion blade now -- daily my face , just every third day my head -- despite some claims contrary , it still going strong ... after almost three weeks !! why my blade lasted this long , despite my pretty heavy usage ? every time i shave , after thoroughly rinsing blade , i give it quick spray shower cleaner . ( such " clean shower " or any no-wipe cleaners you spray after using shower . ) then i set razor so it standing cartridge end down . this two things . shower cleaner ensures no film water remains dry edges blades , leaving spots microscopic rusty areas form , ) standing razor blade-side-down makes sure gravity takes any debris or water might left blade , down away blade edge , since edge blades face up when you cartridge down . prior doing this mach iii blades , i'd also get 3 or 4 good shaves out blade ... but once i tried it , i got many 30 . it makes huge difference ! i should also point out i almost never get nicks cuts . ( i've shaving my head 4 years , i think i've nicked it shaving once ... . part reason because i'm very careful using my blade-cleaning technique . ) note gillette ... send me lifetime supply fusion cartridges i'll consider removing blade-life extending tip this review ! ;-) - jonathan sabi	1
this item not worth money spent it . you not use boiling water steam not last any time all . you better heating water cup microwave breathing steam . you put vicks strips or whatever your cup water . this not good product my books . thanks	-1
how worthless ? let me count ways , unless you child , fit not fit . this not electrical device you only allowed use hot tap water , cup worth , so there no steam . save yourself bit money hot cup tea , it surely produce more steam than this ill-conceived gizmo	-1
price this product lot better than what you find store or salon . very happy my purchase	1

ed600 said " this shaver may last you few months - year , 2 3 years stretch . " well , i disagree . i've using nothing but my remington ms3 2700 every day seven years . i clean unit very quickly after every use purchase replacement foils when necessary ( every 2 years ) . i just bought my second remington ms3 2700 after internal plastic part broke due rigorous cleaning . this unit isn't perfect , but nothing . ( " clean very quickly " i mean i open top let little hairs fall out .	1
i'll keep it short point : this best shaver i've ever used . i thick , heavy beard grows long quickly i sensitive skin . i am recovering surgery needed shaver gave me decent shave without long adjustment period ( because i am unable manipulate blade-type razor ) . this thing absolutely blew me away first time every time i've used it since . i am 42 yrs . old couldn't imagine getting shave like this . it could era i grew up it long time since i've tried electric razor , but this thing great . make sure you follow instructions i'm pretty sure you'll good results . 1 . keep shaver clean lubricated ( it doesn't hurt same your face neck ) . 2 . use trimmer longer beard hairs ( face neck ); pull your skin flat use semi-circular stroke . not press down harder get hairs prove difficult trim or shave ; rather , use method stated previously . , oh yeah : i haven't problem indicator light . i haven't noticed it it doesn't affect functioality . my opinion , this greatest thing since sliced bread	1

i am skeptic nature . someone degree business i expect marketers stretch truth , minimum . i purchased this product thinking if it didn't work it only few dollars . guys work skeptical i until first coffee spill . this little pen even removed coffee stain 4 hours old . we all absolutely amazed ! i used this product following stains it removed them completely : 1 . fresh coffee stain2 . 4 hour old coffee stain3 . balsamic vinegar4 . make up ( foundation)5 . marinara sauce6 . olive oil7 . soy sauceif you or your significant other spill prone , pick one these up right away . i one desk one my purse . i knew tide winner when guys work began purchasing their own tide go pens after using mine . i not recommend this product highly enough . it actually one those products everything it claims .	1

protein bar , vanilla yogurt my favourite energy bar . i eat it after workout or run . it tastes good , it takes time eat ( which good ! ) gives fullness sensation . i particularly like high protein concentration opposed other bars more carbohyrates emphasis . pack 12 lasts me two four weeks good bang buck	1
i am power bar addict i absolutely love this one ... however , vanilla flavor adds ( rather than takes away ... ) typically " cardboard " flavor power bar . oddly enough , this doesn't bother me ! vanilla so sweet ( i am admitted sugar addict ) it really control need snacking . i usually split bar ... one half before my workout one half after . i agree you must water one these bars . it sit like ton bricks your stomach without water . all all , this bar great . i easily get through long day or tough workout one these	1
.... which every 10 or 15 minutes right . i've tried chains , they tangle everything . i tried prescription bifocals , i could not get used them , particularly walking down stairs . i tried prescription pair , framless , light weight , pushed down nose meant worn all time . didn't work me , i'm just not comfortable glasses unless i'm reading . " don't put them chair they'll get bent " -- he right , now they need go back repairs . but they won't because i'm finding these i wear all time . they're around my neck when i need them . adjustable , so if i'm leaning back relaxing against pillow they don't pop out off my nose . i really am love these glasses , short my youthful eyes back this next best solution	1

i've holding out buying new set hot rollers three years , because i couldn't find set i liked : flocked ( means they fuzzy coating grab your hair ) multi-sized , those metal u-shaped clips everyone else seems hate . this set all then some ! it got 8 jumbo-sized rollers , which i hard time finding , plus six 1-1/4 inch rollers six 1-inch size . i fine but thick straight hair varies just below shoulders bra-strap length , this set i either all-large rollers body little wave , or use multiple small rollers lots curl . plus , it came both types clips -- plastic " jaws " kind , u-shaped metal clips . i should say , i bought my set beauty supply store my city , i bought it clearance less than it retails here . nevertheless i feel lucky found it i would paid more . rollers heat very fast hold heat quite while , so i get good tight curl if i let them heat 15 minutes cool 30 . other hand you just get some good body smoothing ten minutes , if you're rush . oh , it on/off switch , so you cut power without unplugging it . this useful if your outlet hard-to-reach place , mine	1

trimspa works great if you take it consistantly . i take 4 6 tablets every day . i start few more per day initially then after few days i cut it back couple . if i take it directed , i discover after 2 days i cannot eat nearly much food without feeling pretty darn full . it isn't i don't ever get hungry its just when i sit down eat , amount i feel full after eating cut half . then i don't feel need eat until next meal . it helps kill snacking overeating me , which makes it great conjunction any type modified eating program you trying stick . it not make me feel jittery or weird . biggest issue just remember take pills 3 times day it tend work little better if you take it hour before each meal . i discovered i cannot lose more than 12 pounds through just dietary changes so i starting adding exercise my program trimspa helping tremendously , because usually when i start working out my appetite goes right up . i believe these great assist any weight loss program you trying stick	1

this my first humidifier ever , so i'm not sure how it compares others , but after reading many reviews other humidifiers , it seems like many humidifiers hit or miss . this one job . it super quiet when it running . only sounds it makes drippity drop water . my only complaint " glug glug glug " sound water it makes maybe every 5 minutes , but it really not loud very tolerable.it great it doesn't any filters change there control dial let you adjust mist . it advertised low power consumption , so that definite plus too . i bought bear shaped one it great it cute , so it not just some random plastic box your room blows off mist . i recommended my friend get one too she loves it well .	1
all low carb bars i've eaten , these one best . little sweet but not too rich . they crispy not dense many others but they still filling . if you not familiar low carb bars , they all seem leave you needing bottle water when finished . these too but not bad most	1
i've other electric toothbrushes before quite liked them , but this hydrabrush far superior any i've ever used before ! i started , suggested literature , extra soft set brushes , after i got knack using this new method , brushed shorter period first few times . explained , gums some bleeding first few times , ( i bleed very easily ) but they not painful bleeding short duration . obviously massaging gums healthy way since so many people develop gum disease this help head off such potentially serious problem . i also like hydrabrush because once it charged , it unplugged placed holder which put anyplace ( one isn't tethered recharge cord ) . so it stored cupboard or any other spot away sink area , just wherever it convenient you . i've used it least 30 times this same first charge ... just turn dial brush it starts right up . i purchased this toothbrush because great feedback when amazon great friday sale , so now i'm complete believer , i'm hoping repeat sale i want get one each my family this time	1
this not ordinary toothbrush . it took me few times adjust how angle it , however it worth initial ackwardness . my teeth never looked or felt cleaner ! half time . what creative concept brushing top , bottom , front , insides teeth same time ! pure genius ... worth every penny more.d.landiswww.gelwithme.co	1
well , i won't reveal my age here , i don't know if my teeth yellowed enough need 20 years taken off them , but i say i - others around me - am seeing results after only 3 days this system . i received free sample package through bzzagent , company creates " buzz " products through word mouth . however , i am natural skeptic ... i guess i believed these products just out there prey vulnerable smokers who self-conscious all us non-smokers picking them . non-smoker who nevertheless loves dark-coloured drinks ( coke , root beer , tea , coffee ) , i've never used any kind whitening product , except toothpastes which didn't work . crest whitestrips commercials , i thought strips would something almost invisible you could wear while work , subway or wherever . not quite ! what it worth , they sort look feel like bandaids your teeth ; slippery bandaids wiggle around if you try anything more stressful than write amazon reviews . :-) but let put this into perspective : you use them twice day ( 1/2 hr each time ) ten days you're good long while ( how long depends your personal eating/drinking/smoking habits ) . you even use one strip 1/2 hour , then start your second strip right away afterwards ... get it all over even faster . first evening i tried whitestrips renewal , i put them watch tv , i don't think i them quite right because they kept slipping around . also , i didn't rinse my fingers peroxide made my fingertips turn white sting . however , quick rinse took care . not get this stuff your eyes , your clothing or any other delicate surface . it powerful stuff ! anyway , i cursing strips until i realized i would just not speak half hour while i them . maybe other people manage it , but talking doesn't work me strips . since then , it breeze each time . so ... i guess caveats you should set aside time this , during tv-watching or web-surfing downtime ( bonus , you may lose weight not snacking half-hour ! ) , not expect out doing errands strips like people commercials seem able . anyway , if you want turn back clock few years turn up compliments , whitestrips renewal system seems like great way go - fraction cost professional dental whitening	1

i finally bought shower mirror . this one works grea t.t he light stays 5 minutes auto shuts off . it little razor holder it it doesn't steam up ! great mirror !	1
i think it stayed fogless two uses . after , it fogged up like any ordinary mirror - even using " special glass cleaner " it came . too bad . total dissappointment .	-1
i like this - i tie it my waist , adjust it where it hurts , keep going . this type cold pack doesn't seem cold me real ice or gel types , but it good its type . when i needed it colder , i held gel pack it	1
my husband really enjoyed this trimmer . such inexpensive item it gives great results	1
like original eternity , eternity purple orchid sweet-smelling scent , but it much more flowery than its parent fragrance . upon initial application , purple orchid intense floral bouquet bit strong my tastes . over time , however , scent becomes significantly softer , making flower notes more subtle taking more powdery , slightly musky quality . this makes purple orchid pretty , muted daytime fragrance , although it might too delicate those who prefer bolder perfume	1
after many years using braun " straight blade " electric razor , i very pleasantly surprised how well easily this shaved . my only disappointment there no led display when razor power low -- it just stops . i still hate shave , but $70 i paid this , its great i highly recommend it	1
this my chance see if reviews you read here real people got product .. :) i got this shaver month ago .. i using regular wet razor got tired run work piece toilet paper so i could clean blood coming out my face . it also pain butt spread shaving cream , then get rid it every day . now i am using spectra i'm very happy i t.t he instructions tell you give up 3 weeks your face get used new shaving system . but my opinion , it just way them make you learn first how use machine . i not notice any differences skin or shave after " getting used " period compared first day i used norelco . but i not mean there no difference skin . you feel skin lot better softer after fist shave this system vs . razor . i am still learning how get best shave it . i shaved my face point i got closer shave than razor few times . other times i get just ok shave , but not close before . i think it depends how hair reacts machine any given day . sometimes i spend more time get same results other days . but no more than 5 minutes . i always used it normal mode . this way it supposed fastest . my tip you would this : instructions tell you shave your face clean . but if you shave right after taking your daily shower , like your face gets humid less slippery norelco . i better results my face really dry . so i clean my face night before shave when i wake up , before taking my shower . this way i my face clean really dry . sometimes you make more than gentle pressure heads your face catch cut hair closer . i got some irritation my lower part neck few times ... it little difficult catch hairs area .. may because skin softer there . battery last lot . it very practical machine , comes pouch so i shave mornings i wake up my girlfriend home . no more blood me . but take care your lip . once i catch it little spectra got bad feeling it few days . i think some more time , i perfect technique always get shave i want spectra 8825xl . i recommend this machine anyone . it great . sorry my bad english .. i speak spanish . good luck !	1
my electric shaver everything i wanted . i saved so much money , great service , great product , got here quicker than expected .. thank you , i'll shop you again ..	1
new mom i so afraid take my baby temperature ... i might hurt her or put it too far . then i saw this thermometer couldn't get over how easy it use . i found it very accurate . i purchased this two baby showers since buying it myself . it gives great peace mind	1
i other thermometers i using until one day they gave normal reading my daughter burning up i knew she fever . i used this thermometer , which confirmed she fever ... so easy use . just put some vaseline end you not insert it too far . i think package actually says it takes longer get reading than it really ... it very fast ! i no problem buying more expensive products when they work , but don't waste your money $50 thermometers ... they not accurate ! this one great doctors want you take rectal reading anyway !!	1
i've used these aquis towels before , i purchased this one due size - previously they only available small sizes . this body size , my surprise , surface feels better so it doesn't " snag " your skin you rub it . it still its job - making you dry .	1
installation this shower head little tricky . head arm * heavy * so extra plumber tape joint arm pipe comes out wall needed order avoid leaks . comparison rain-pour shower head i , water pressure this showhead awesome ! i agree previous review point pulsating rain little lame . however , fact shower head made plastic keeps water hot . i've noticed significant difference temperature my morning shows ! i recommend this product	1
remarkably accurate ! i only found two wrist bp monitors which provided accurate results time time again . hospice nurse i try inflict little discomfort possible my patients . this monitor detected bp when my arm cuff unable so . this my second purchase this model brand because my 91 y/o grandmother swiped first one . : -	1
i bought this after advice curly hair forum , it speeds drying therefore cuts down frizz . i agree it seem speed drying time hair when it wrapped this , but it feels terrible against skin . this not kind towel one would want use anything but hair . when you touch it ( any microfiber towel matter ) , it feels like your skin very , very dry because it catches every fiber . it soaks water hair dries quickly afterward when i hang it over side tub . it would help if it little bit wider , but this size seems standard	1
i using regular razor years but price blades figured something like this would worth it , when i saw this sale 50 bucks i jumped it . i only used it twice already noticed closer shave , so i highly reccomend this razor !	1
i like quietness shaver , closeness shave , lightness razor . also , i like larger holding area whiskers . i don't like not able buy solution locally , or even norelco website . i don't know what i'll when i run out solution	1
great price good shaver . this replaced my other braun shaver several years old . i gotten many years service old one . i like guard protects screen on/off button . i travel lot my old one get turned travel dead when i arrive . it won't happen this one due design guard	1
i wanted electric afternoon shaving . something faster than good old blade . this works very well . afternoon shave makes morning shave lot easier faster . blades stay cleaner less likely nick . price represents good value . only area shaver seems problems back jaw just below ear . knowing i compensate . easy clean . battery lasted weeks . fit either hand very comfortable . overall great little shaver price . tip blade users , try using shave soap brush place stuff . better shave lot less expensive , don't forget put little water cup after your shave so it not dry out	1
this , obviously , waterpik " econo " hand-held showerhead . i using their showerheads least 15 years , see no difference quality this one its higher-priced siblings . apparently , merely limiting number settings 3 , waterpik hold price down fraction what their more expensive models fetch . me , its perfect . i noticed previous model i owned , i used only regular spray , pulsating massage , occasionally , combination setting . precisely what jm-351 offers . why pay more settings i don't use ? regular spray pleasant , refreshing " needle " type spray provides good flow water even rinsing shampoo out hair . massage provides forceful pulsation actually massage ! fact , it so forceful you need careful where you point it . but sore shoulder or spasming back , its great . combination setting continuous - , you rotate head spray massage , you gradually get less spray more massage . jm-351 curved handle , which not typical waterpiks what i tell . this yields one advantage one disadvantage . because handle pronounced curve , if you tilt pivot ball downward , you get spray point straight down . this permits you easily step out water spray while you soap up , shave or whatever . my old straight-handled model , this not possible . unfortunately , curve also makes handle slightly less comfortable hold than if it straight - especially soapy , slippery hands . not big problem , but noticeable enough make it worth mentioning . installation hint : waterpik very good maintaining same size fittings thread sizes across their entire line over time . if you replacing existing waterpik , you replace just hose handle , while continuing use existing pivot ball bracket . fact , if your current hose good condition , you could replace just handle . 30-second installation ! my only ( minor ) complaint after 2 months 60 hot showers , hose not completely relaxed . it still sort " sticks out " instead just dangling limply bracket way old one . i expect eventually this happen . if you not " style-monster " who requires more elegantly appointed showerhead , if you need only basic spray massage patterns , this your showerhead . highly recommended	1

i am big fan rayovac rechargeable batteries . i primarily use aa aaa batteries . we would normally go through large number batteries ( especially aa ) now we don't . my recharge count continues grow , i only dispose 1 or 2 batteries . they also tend more powerful then average non-rechargabel aa battery . they great cameras , toys , remote controls , portable electronics . i set each child they keep track them keep them charged . it reallys saves money hassel . additionally , i don't keep throwing batteries into trash , which great	1

steam rollers works so great i bought back up set event one breaks . my hair chemically relaxed very porous , so i surprised steam rollers worked so well ( steam or humidity under normal circumstances turns my hair into frizzy mess ) . i recommend using paper ends not over fill water . hair turns out healthy consistently soft , smooth , silky lots body .	1
first i skeptical because i've always used curling irons past . top , my ventures into hot roller systems weren't wonderful . they hot one bulky . set enough curlers fit my head took up way too much counter space . curling irons ok alternative me many years but it would burn if it too hot or not curl if it wasn't hot enough . soon i wasn't doing anything except blow drying ... then i decided get this set . i've never heard steam setter before but it sounded like it worth try . i'm so glad i ! it mix sponge curlers heated curlers so it pretty comfortable because it softer lighter than regular hot rollers . but it still easy snap right into your hair . steam secret ( i use filtered/bottled water because i'm afraid hard water build up unit . i just keep bottle my bathroom ) . you hair unstylably dry it would still curl . plus steam leaves your hair soft , just like when you first blow-dry wet hair . i usually put curlers before going through my morning make-up routine . you should take them out before you change or if you 30 minute car ride , take them out before you leave house so curls loosen up bit . that all there too it . if you want set some hair spray ... go right ahead ! this product comes unit produces steam which regular ionic mode . i don't know what difference except when it ionic mode , it creates more steam more noisy . regular mode silent . it also comes lots rollers 3 sizes . you stow curlers away under sink or closet just leave steam unit your counter ( it size box olay facial cloths ) . you should try it if you want curl your hair often . unless you put your hand right up steam vent , there no chance you burning yourself rollers don't get hot enough damage your hair either . like all curling products , it takes practice couple trail runs get configuration timing down . then , it piece cake	1
i recently purchased this product cold winter months north . i also put lots lotion prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy but dreaded putting cold lotion . this product i would definately recommend anyone likes put lotion but hates putting it cold	1
first spray , this pretty potent cologne , but after 1-2 minutes this fades into nice rosey spice scent much lighter than it green original polo brother . lasts all day long into night . worth checking out if you fan cool water lotto , or lighter scented cologne .	1
i used older model sonicare toothbrush several years very happy results . your gums feel great your teeth really cleaned well . so , i decided update purchased i8300 . once you get used it ( little bulky ) i don't think there toothbrush compare it . concept toothpaste guided you your teeth gums just push button great . afer using it just once , you think your teeth gums cleaned professional . this one great toothbrush i highly recommend it , especially people who gum problems . there one drawback , toothpaste refills only made crest . but , you don't use refills just put your own brand toothbrush . overall , great product	1
this item going into trash since it performs so poorly it not worth price replacement brushes toothpaste cartridges ( which it consumes voraciously ) . therefore , i decided bite bullet throw it out - actuality throwing out over $100.00 . however , i wanted warn other unsuspecting consumers not mislead claims made manufacturer its ads . this produce not get teeth - it definitely not close flossing it effect ( nowhere near it fact ) . also , toothpaste not flow evenly - it either clumps up turns into gooey mess or comes out too fast gets all over toothbrush counter . when i e-mailed sonicare , ( incidentally you open " account " them before they even accept your e-mail ) , i told time frame refund passed they sorry i didn't like their product - period ! when i wrote them back asking them least provide name retailer my area who carries replacement brushes - wal-mart stopped handling brushes particular model - so i would not pay shipping handling costs top everything else , they not even give me courtesy reply . bottom line my dentist told me my teeth much worse shape after using this brush than before . i think says it all	-1
i thermometer which normally takes 15 sec read temprature accurately . this one takes 1-2 seconds only . it requires 2 small size battery which provided . 20 probe covers also included set . before using thermometer directly , go through user manual otherwise you end up getting wrong temprature . they given details pictures words which very much explains infrared technique utilized this . i initially getting incorrect temprature but later after some practice , using it properly . good thermometer 20 bucks . only drawback i found , battery cover which seems very fragile like other mark fitness products battery cover . why don't they fix this problem :|	1

my husband i both back problems moist heat seems ease pain times . we've always told moist heat best . i finally decided " bite bullet " buy new heating pad ( ours least 20 years old ) . you not add any water this pad - it pulls moisture air ; it electric , shut off after 30 minutes . you control heat . this worth investment we very happy it	1
genious came up idea make this shape around shoulders neck !! love it ! i also regular size theratherm i highly recommend them both . i love digital display set your temp timer shut-off , cause i sometimes fall asleep don't worry it left . these pads heavy weight so they slide around you never add water , it idiot-proof	1

i just bought this item today after going through multiple alarm clock/music combo models . this one most features i looking . pros : works any ipod , digital am/fm tuner , neat projection , calming sounds feature , nice design , good sound quality , dual alarms , sets itself , lithium ion battery case power outage . while this one kind nitt picky it important me , it back forth dial setting alarm . way while setting it if you accidentally go past time when you want wake up you just push backward instead going all way back through . it very easy se t.t he cons : kinda pricey , kinda big , " beep " really irritating ( but you wake up ipod , radio , or soothing sounds ) , no remote , you need scan through music ipod via click wheel ( no scan buttons actual machine ) . despite few cons , i would say this worth 80 bucks . i am enjoying mine	1

i heard tingler years , found listing amazon quite randomly . this least expensive one , so i decided see what all hub-bub . it really indescrible sensation , but name tingler pretty much sums it up . most common reaction i get it lot squealing , even guys . i one friend , though , absolutely hates it ; i think it may just too intense her . even my cat dog like it!it truely unique sensation , even little addicting . certainly not one life necessities , but definitely one it little pleasures	1

i lost set these perfect hot curlers while traveling while back- after depending them many years . i thought i'd never find them again- they'd stopped making them ! originally i found them my drugstore-but couldn't find them again any store or web . ( it would help if they called them " hot curlers " !!! not hot setters !!! ) so now last 2 years i've tried every brand made , i think . frustrated these other inferior products , i finally tried stab finding something comparable web again voila ! nothing else compares these perfect hot curlers curling my hair quickly ! light-weight , compact , superfast heat-up , perfectly set lasting curl , don't get tangled your hair when you pull them out , leave your hair smooth- no lumps bumps , travel europe other non-us countries just adaptor plug , what else you want ? oh , curler size perfect . this hot setter 5 great workhorse great job fast , saves me time , makes my hair look beautiful . i get lots compliments my hair- it so easy ! i wear stylish but spend just 10 15 minutes heating , curling brushing . i also found using hair products give my hair little extra body hair spray makes hot curl really last . i lighten my hair these don't any damage . buy them , you won't sorry !	1
i tried replace my old norelco which worked pretty good . i thought going new norelco would upgrade -- not so . this thing worse than my 5 year-old shaver . it comes bunch worthless junk ( jet cleaning system ? ) . worst all , it rips hair our my face which obviously hurts !! don't buy this thing , please	-1
razor shaves pretty well , however , cleaning unit not function . when i called norelco they told me likely cause chip razor unit not " communicating " cleaning unit -- suggesting it problem not uncommon company knows . replacement procedures would take up four weeks get replacement razor my hands -- leaving me without razor interem -- not good way keep you customers satisfied . addition , razor uses three rubber shock absorbers function well , but which i see wear down over time ( certainly well before any plastic components razor would wear out ) . this poor design my opinion . these problems led me return razor refund . i've used norelco razors 30 years , but this my last one	1

it helps you dry burns wattery thing inside your face ou t.t his non toxic device used heat up pimples until it get small dry . this product better than proactiv . proactive not work my face instead it irritates get wors t.t ry wash your face dove skin soap more than 1hr soften your face remove pus . then , path it dry use zeno , don't over use this product because it might hurt burn your skin . failure use this product properly might cause 1st degree burn . never use any chemicals your face while using this product . excessive large pimples , i see some people apply clean duct tape their face , keep it 3-8 hrs remove it . you would notice all pus lying your face you just need clean it using clean water skin soap .	1
i few " cheap " humidifers like this before . most use filters . none them gives out visible water steam like this one . this one really works ! one hour , it able raise humidity my average size bedroom ( door opened ) 31% 40% . when i left it overnight smallest steam volume setting , humidity my room raised 61% ! i never seen something quite like this before . it very quiet except water dripping sound which i take it like it raining outside . i don't problem water spilling all over like some other reviewers . i think they didn't screw bottom cap properly . there only little bit moisture around base but nothing serious . only regret ? can't preset humidity stop steam it reaches there . but then , this price , what more you expect ? i rate it 5-star	1
this perfume truly best one out there . probably only ones come close hugo , armani code polo blue . great anytime day or night . always favorite among ladies .	1

terrible product : 1 . water not stay warm nor it heat up2 . attachments not stay ... attached3 . during operation , water splashes out . even water level below recommended water level . this product not worth what i paid . fact , based upon 3 issues mentioned it not bargin any price . buyer beware	-1
after trying this product , i am disappointed . it not all it hyped up . instead helping me sleep better , it caused me more awake . i tossed turned after taking this product more than i before taking this product . i find something better or more effective	1
better than those little tiny heads . who likes little tiny heads ? i don't like little tiny heads	1
i really enjoyed ordering this product online because it lasted me long time . before ordering this product i go store more frequently buy diapers . i looked everywhere box this size rather impressed when i found it here this site . love this product !	1

i spent long time searching shaver promised me 5 o clock shadow look . after doing extensive research , i ruled out " vaccum " models , since i didnt expect keep long beard . i wanted , just enough 2-3 day stubble . 1 ) build quality - mb300 felt solid my hand . 2 ) efficiency - well , one reviewers said remington mb300 not suitable very short facial hair i agree him . out box , this true , even setting set 1(lowest ) . though reminton says 1-2 settings gives 5 o clock shadow , i dont agree . but if one removes protector , then one get close trim . i wanted even shorter trim . finally , pop trimmer gave me look i wanted , smart 2-3 days look stubble . it not pop up trimmer , i might returned this one . guys who plan buy mb400 should not , it doesn't pop up trimmer . 3 ) first few times i used it , i experienced slight skin irritation . i attribute this my inability use trimmer correctly . its better now . overall , i am happy " now " . dual voltage option would great .	1
i've tried couple other brands those always seem underpowered . this one different - it plenty power massage motor . some shapes little weird no apparent anatomical reason , but this feels like pulse rather than like buzzer	1
this one lives up its advertising , folks ! it quick , easy , painless , quite effective . my advice shave regular razor one day get required stubble needed seiko ( anything longer won't get cut ) , then use seiko before your shower every day thereafter . bikini area hard place keep smooth ! this electric razor makes it much easier	1

if you love loose leaf tea , you love this stainless steel mesh tea ball . there nice little latch ( you sort see left tea ball top ) which keeps all tea leaves safely tea ball never lets them into your tea pot or mug . i fill this my favorite jasmine tea or provence rooibos , which always loose leaf it seems , then hang metal hook over edge mug so i easily remove it . just let tea ball sit mug bit then swirl it around remove it . i suggest rinsing it immediately then opening it let it dry out . mine never rusted ! i would not put this dishwasher ! i just think it so many uses , you also use it hot apple cider when you want add cloves pieces cinnamon or you use it filled herbs when making stock . i just love it . ~ rebecca revie	1

i earlier model braun travel shaver mediocre -- little weak shaving power it would sometimes turn movement my travel bag . this one plenty power , microscreen allows very close shave , plus it rotating lock switch prevents it accidentally turning itself . fact , i like this shaver so well , even though i ordinarily use blade , sometimes i'll pick it up home quick shave or evening touch-up before going out . one drawback -- while it generally shaves close blade , if i skip day shaving two days ' worth beard , this shaver little trouble cutting -- it tends slide over matted down hairs somewhat it takes some work get them all cut . i think that characteristic microscreen shavers	1
this tub stool perfect . i very small shower this stool small enough fit it comfortable secure sit . i can't find one thing wrong it	1
this epilator its job . it less painful compared others because skin protector cap , but really short hair you take it off otherwise it won't grab hair . batery doesn't last long so large jobs ( like legs ) you keep it plugged , but cordless really helps those smaller jobs odd angles ..	1
i've using it 3 years now ( though i just purchased new one after losing it ) it really impressive product . it exactly what it says it . i think it especially useful when you also remington precision trimmer smallest details	1

i owned one these years just loved it . when my daughter injured her back i lent it her course didn't see it again so then came time when i wanted heating pad didn't one . took trip walmart purchased most expensive moist heating pad they which around $29.00 . what waste money ( slow , not enough heat , barely any moisture ) it really got me appreciate how awesome these professional moist heating pads . extent which these pads produce moist ( i mean moist ) heat amazing they it matter minutes enough justify price alone . dollar dollar this large pad worth its weight gold . although it heavier than those department store pads weight big selling point . it actually helps it feel good your back because pad weighted down it closer your skin . it also makes it so pad not slipping off or moving around your back . flannel cover substantial high quality material(not thin , rough or cheap fabric ) soft cozy . it washable well . controls easy operate . bottom line nothing out there compares these professional pads . don't waste your time money anything else .	1
this definitely best shaver i ever owned . motorin this shaver very strong powerful . i tough beard it shaves close blade , just like remington slogan says . also , features come shaver great too .	1
shipping took more than 2 weeks reach me . there package damage got ship back amazon but never shipped back me until i call customer service . customer service great though	1
this item worked very well us keep our 20 month old opening several doors . however , if you very thin door handles , you may need tape some cardboard around handles pad them up enough make sure this snaps back into place . it only took me 30 minutes install 6 these , so i'm not so sure other reviewer comment . we always open these one handed , so our son doesn't figure out how open it -- his hands too small it one hand . if he saw us it two , he would probably figure it out ! reviewers who wrote this won't work left-handed doors or who think it lock you out other side clueless . this item used either side door , when installed side interior door without lock it set up allow access hole unlocking locked door , it not lock door other side	1

starting out ' 50 remington into ' 60 blade , i continued blade until i received 7240xl . my hand started shake i using lots styptic stick so decided try electric . i found 7240xl line read time 19 reviews which convinced me give it try . i cannot say enough good things this shaver . shave i get now equal or better than blades no styptic . i found less pressure i apply better shave . first few days difficult my neck but once i reduced pressure shaver i not issue . it holds charge 10 days very quiet . rinsing under faucet real plus . i highly recommend this shaver . i wish i tried it sooner .	1
replaced 10 year old norelco found this far best electric razor i've ever used . closest shaves i've ever .	1
i'm doing this little review case anyone wondering what " twilight crush " color looks like . colors aren't described well , all colors picture aren't listed , so you can't easily tell which which . now clicking color choice bring you single product screen , which better than few weeks ago , when i bought mine . i mistakenly thought shimmer twilight crush pillow distorting way color appeared picture , it pretty color rose girl holding . instead , it strange , shimmery green burgundy red color , quite similar picture they up now , but where picture looks brown , it actually much more red . shimmery green dominant color , however , red more " background " color . my opinion , it not very pleasant look , but it smells good , maybe i'll get used odd color combination . if i could it over , i'd go blue feather color choice ... i'd also wondered why it funny little heart sewn onto front pillow . that actually little pocket , inside which very small cloth scent packet . rest filling accessed through velcro pouch back pillow . open it up , you'll find pouch unscented buckwheat . this quite nice ; case you don't like way scent smells , you remove it ; also so you're not over-heating scent packet when you heat buckwheat packet	1
great shaver . good price . easy clean . easy use . shaves almost close blade	1
i used original epilady years now new modelwhich great . very satisfied	1
after getting used initial " shock " feeling hair removed , i found using epilady way better than conventional razor . i especially like it because it cordless .	1
epilady legend best hair removal system i ever used . legend leaves legs smooth weeks time , hair grows much finer . pain very tollerable diminishes time use . it definitely worth it , considering it only once every 3-5 weeks . i loyal user many years would not replace it anything else ! i highly recommend legend everyone	1
i love my sonicare intelliclean system ! i've difficulty finding replacement heads stores but i'm becoming online guru . i love fact amazon makes it too easy buy replacement heads i never spend hours going store store looking this again . i love extra burst toothpaste i give myself while brushing . i love timed ' zone ' beep . brush head cleans quickly dash water toothbrush holds charge week so i unplug recharger save energy ( one many stop global warming )	1
item ordered ( arrived ) item exactly it pictured presented . it arrived timely manner	1
every time i pass baby food display store , i think how many millions dollars parents could saving , if they would just make their own baby food , rather than paying top price those cute little jars ! i take every opportunity tell parents using hand baby food mill . $10 i paid my baby food mill definitely one best investments i ever made ! i purchased it my first six children , just loved it ! i found it much , much more convenient than blender , several reasons . blender fine preparing large batches baby food freeze , but not bit practical making single serving your baby . blender much more difficult clean , not very practical take table , it difficult get all food out bottom it . noise it doesn't make it especially handy table use , either . hand grinder perfectly quiet , makes use every bit food you put into it , taken used anywhere ! it very handy feeding baby out , directly , parts easy hand wash or thrown dishwasher . also , it very easy feed baby some same foods you prepared your whole family . food not come out pureed , like blender , but i found my babies preferred little texture . it used almost anything except hard , dry foods , like chips , or taco shells . many harder foods , like fresh apples , should diced first . some foods come out better addition little water or other liquid . my grinder retirement now , after 14 years use , but it still good working order . i am saving it day when i grandchildren use it ! i just can't say enough good it , hope many parents try it . it makes excellent baby gift , too !	1
this best meal replacement shake i ever tasted . first time , i mixed it skim milk , but it came out extremely thick , so now i just use water , it still tastes great . no joke , it tastes almost like chocolate pudding . , plus fact it replaces meal contains only 3g fat , 19g carbs , 260 calories , still manages pack 38g protein , 3g fiber , ton vitamins each serving . each packet only costs $1.45 . if you get tired just chocolate , mix scoop peanut butter it blender . it doesn't get much better than this	1
i got this yesterday tried it . i can't say enough it . works great , less pain , mess hassle waxing i love it	1
i never write reviews , but when shopping epilator i disappointed there no reviews this product because i rely quite bit customer reviews products like this . i lifelong waxer , result i developed quite high pain tolerance . while this product works extremely well ( doesn't really hurt legs ) i say beginning , bikini area pretty painful . after using it while , pain diminishes but no means pleasure . besides obvious discomfort associated pulling your hair out , this really great product i highly recommend it	1
this fragrance miyake , best . scent last hours , its not appealing male gender but surely captivate attention women .	1
i use armani acqua di gio chanel homme often but i've found lot people smelling like me . di gio too common . issey miyake just right- not enough people know it it smells wonderful . it fruity , light over-tones leave you thinking tokyo during spring time . my girlfriend can't get enough it wear my shirts when i'm away close scent . if you're willing splurge acqua di gio , you should try issey miyake . l'eau d'issey one miyake older fragrances . his newer stuff smells similar but i don't like it much . really d'issey miyake chanel no . 5 . it classic really one kind fragrance make you want more .	1
... well , i'd rather masseuse house on-demand , but theracane great substitute . i tried using tennis balls rolling them , but theracane not only more effective , but easier use . i'm going buy some friends same age related neck aches	1
i bought these clippers take deployemnt iraq . i found them quite good cutting short military style haircuts . it battery plenty life manage whole haircut juice spare . guides work well , but not enough variety adjustment shorter lengths " buzz cuts " i would like blades cut bit closer scalp without guides . clippers lack heft i wonder their durability over time . while these clippers should not considered replacement proper plug-in model they resonable substitute particularly if one traveling outside us where 50 hz power makes regular clippers unusable	1
i used this haircut kit myself friend , it working very good . adjustable combs work fine , i couldn't find any other much range sizes . i haven't any trouble regarding adjusting lock nor weakness combs . it giving me good results saving me money . i took risk buy it , although previous reviews weren't good , i'm happy it didn't disappointed me . i would like left/right ear combs this trimmer , though	1
i agree so many others . nursing mom 7 children , i say confidence - these best	1
nursing mom you ever walked around , public , wet circles your shirt not know it ? i , so embarassing ! infact , i returning different brand nursing pad target . i complained clerk return desk , happened young male , how terrible this item i needed return purchase something else . his smirk should clued me . i left store feeling content my shopping trip i felt cool breeze my chest . kinda odd hot august day so i looked down see two huge wet spots my shirt !!!!! nice , huh ?! since day , my purchase lansinoh nursing pads , i alway worn these . they thin hold good amount milk , great those who constant let-downs like myself . they not noticable under clothing like other bulkier pads . very comfortable ! special occasions try lilypadz , silicone nursing pads . check it out , they gently stick your skin washable . they perfect dress you can't wear bra ideal when you go swimming . no need baby diaper your boobs swell up after dip	1
tines could little less flexible give you really good scratch , but overall , i love it . i've never seen anything so trippy everyone who sees this needs try it	1
i purchased this roller set gift someone after reading amazon reviews ; her experience not match those other reviewers . remington h-1080n rollers slow heat , roller clamps difficult place proper position , it difficult put rollers back their proper slots when finished . product design fundamentally flawed : clamps , rollers , parking slots not color-coded . this item returned my shipping expense --- 15 year old clairol unit this item meant replace heats faster works better	-1
i never really loved this heating pad . contents within rubber get twisted easily , it seemed heat unevenly times , towards end its life i actually heard little clicking noises coming it . i got it christmas last year , used it few days after .... then last night it died . no heat , though light went . this thing weekly use my couch -- never left 5 foot radius . i didn't fold it up , i never used it moisture . year use letdown .	1
i liked this product lot because it easy use , well discreet compact . it great travelling . trimmer allows you take off much or little hair possible , although when i took off trimmer comb attachment used only shaver , i nicked myself few times . there shaving attachment which you can't use bikini area ( due density hair ) , but i've used it my legs great results	1
best diapers market ! i never any leaks , they fit perfectly it best value your money .	1

this far worse tasting stuff i've ever i've plenty my venture healthy person . owner health food store my neighborhood swears this product , so , i bought it 3 years ago . it now one my daily drinks . it taste awful if you don't play it drink . i put soy milk ( approx . 8 ounces , flaxseed oil ( 1-2 tablespoons ) , lecithin , banana . if these items you don't use , play this product . it worth health benefits . i love it swear it . eve	1
finally product acually massages your foot . this really works greatfor price . not good human(if you find someone who willing it ) , but very satisfing	1
great product . much quieter than i expected . doesn't seem blow hard old style but it dries faster . better than old style too because it doesn't blow your hair all over	1
many perfumes give me headache , this one doesn't . besides , it perfect blend fruity , woody spicy , tendency toward spicy , least my skin . i wear it day night , thou i tend take it out more often winter approaches.as all perfumes , you try it your skin see ( sniff :)) yourself .	1

i skeptical genie able lift my thick 13 " mattress , but , because medical reasons , thought i'd give it try . i'm sleeping like log lifting head 1 " . it lift it full way reading well . i love it . it bit loud , but you don't need use pump all time it keeps air pretty well . if you sleep alone queen bed , it get bit lopsided if you stay one side , but if you move slightly middle , it isn't problem	1
unknown reason i getting canker sores my tongue over past 2 years . they would come go . after suffering through painful episodes not able eat , talk or move my mouth 3 days worth time it would go away only appear different location . it became endless cycle suffering stressing me out making my life pure discomfort say least . i tried every over counter medication out there you get every drug store area . some take pain away but none them truly eliminated problem . until i tried this toothpaste . this stuff works . it really works . it wasn't until i started use this stuff regularly problem truly went away . i skeptical first , there so many other products out there said same thing " help eliminate canker sores " but this truly what it said it would . just brush your teeth daily morning regular amount toothpaste you normally use . make sure you take your time brush this paste very short time period you notice outbreak canker sores come end . i can't recomend this stuff enough . it really life changer me delievers promised . once you start using it , you won't go back any other alternatives . mint flavor mild toothpaste itself helps clean whiten your teeth . so you getting two services price one this product . finally canker sore victims give sigh pure pain free relief . thanks rembrandt , extra whitening canker sore relief toothpaste . if you looking relief your canker sore outbreaks . this product get . it works ! it works ! it works	1

nice find product actually works well benefits environment not using bleaching process whiten wipes . we same wipe box 7th gen ages continue buy 80 pack wipes refill	1
these great . they least amount yucky stuff them all wipes i seen . course this makes them best baby ! not really more expensive than " normal " wipes . if you order case amazon you get free shipping . what deal ! if you want try them first , call your local health food store . they'll more expensive there , but worth giving them chance	1
guess i not realize measurements where washcloth size , so i ended up ordering mediums , perfect spin class gym ! other than great product	1
if you extreme pain your neck , shoulders , upper back , this excellent product . i degenerative cervical disc disease ms so this product helps ease pain throughout day but expecially morning . forget rectangular pads $20 , this worth every penny . my generates more heat typical low , med , high selections most heating pads . moist heat ability go up 166 degrees . though it dry heat option i can't imagine ever using it because moist heat really penetrates below surface bring you relief . my only complaint cord should extend front flaps not back one . it little annoying but overall worth small inconvenience every penny i paid it	1
time my enemy . i live two places-in country city -- crazy job . result : little time myself . i insist products work well quickly . heel smoother perfect . amazing , really . i can't afford bloody feet-a danger some foot products-as i race around city , largely foot , run country . addition , i am petrified pain . no problem heel smoother ! person who complained battery short life , i recommend set rechargeable batteries . i use them my digital camera . this product worth try .	1
i cartilage tears my knees - i started using this within week i without knee pain running beach 4 days row no pain or swelling since second week using this - couldn't before - i am physician started recommending it my patients - mix it blueberries , acai berries or grape juice blender mix easier cut taste ( i just use water shake it up ) - or use pills if you want - i also recommend green vibrance it - antiinflammatory component it . i combine both - bit strong taste but i only use water - mix juice	1
ok , don't compare this shaver ones costing twice much . said , price this great shaver . it gives me close shave , operated much sleepier condition than mach 3 , my blade choice . it works fine my goatee ( although i use something else trimming ) works fine when i clean-shaven . it took my skin around week or two get adjusted new shaving technique . but now this works great every morning keeps me good throughout day . only areas i trouble my adam apple under my ear , but i big apple bony jaw my mach 3 tough time these areas . braun beats my mach 3 it never cut me . maintenance clean up breeze . just rinse head under water you're good . want get it extra clean , add some liquid hand-soap rinse , or take foil off brush it down little brush . oil occasionally , replace foil cutting block every 18 months . i think my battery life over 50 minutes , but i'm not really timing it . if i market new shaver , wasn't going spend more upgrade , i definitely choose this one again . it really 4 half stars , just missing last half because it doesn't lot high end bells whistles	1
my braun 6520 served me well few years , but battery died . i would happy replacing battery unit , but apparently not option . i contemplated purchase more expensive , highly-rated braun unit self-cleaning station , but thought better it because it seemed like more bulk bother ( e.g. purchase replacement cleaning solution ) than i really needed . i settled 5614 i am pleased . i shaved two weeks before exhausting battery . shaver recharged hour . other reviewers pointed out , charge deplete very rapidly once low-charge light comes , but according specs , i shave cord ( not yet tried it ) or battery power . i love hard case -- it protects shaver head dents dings , which problem my old unit . true , ac cord not fit case , but doesn't bother me bit . shave quality very good . trimmer adequate , but oriented parallel long dimension shaver , instead 90 degree angle . took some getting used , but i adapted . summary , exceptionally high performance : price ratio . 5614 just right me .	1
shaves well . i don't use trimmer much , but it seems work ok me . three design negativescord doesn't fit casecord appears 110vac transformer so would need special , more expensive cord 220v . my previous braun transformer built accomodat any voltage , so it simply needed cheap cord european plug when i travelled . case broke after less than year . braun cases less well built than shavers general	1
razor offers close shave , conveniently used wet or dry , rinsed liquid soap clean it . all all very nice . my only complaints razor little heavier than expected , which inconvenient travel razor , i thought it came rechargeable lithium batteries . no , they disposable lithium batteries . still , they should good 50-60 uses changing . razor compact form factor , wet/dry functionality , close shave outweigh negatives	1
i don't understand previous reviewer comments not able use this unless sitting . i lying down last night my stomach it worked great my back ! i like it better than my thumper ii because it much easier me handle more lightweight ! i never able handle thumper my own . i love all massage choices , especially chopping motion ... it if someone pounding my back , it so targeted i spend much time i want one location without it itching most massagers ! ( i hour hour half commute work each way , so my neck shoulders get extremely sore . ) i love it so much i bought one my boss , am thinking giving one everyone my family christmas	1
love love love this heating pad ... auto turn off great feature ... 4 settings ... only flaw control thing pretty big ... other than its great .....	1

excellent product recommended my dentist . this second one i owned . first one lasted 3 years . not bad $40.00	1
my dental hygenist recommeded this item it works better than i expected . it already improved my gums saved me oral surgery . this basic item unless you're idiot it all you need sonic care toothbrush . all more expensive versions offer needless beeps ways let you know when 30 seconds up . if you hate flossing aren't likely keep up it , this sonicare job your teeth	1
my old sonicare finally crapped out i needed new one . i saw this one amazon , which exactly like my old one . sure they " new improved " ones now , but they basically same thing cost almost twice much . this best bet money . it works great keeps my teeth clean shiny visits dentist .	1
this really nice little fountain . i it my wish list received it gift , i concerned because it seemed larger than i originally thought . but when assembled , it stands only 10 " tall , which perfect my desk work . sound trickling water quiet enough it isn't discernable my co-workers it very attractive addition my cube . only problem , it doesn't come enough rocks cover base , but rocks easy come . , although it isn't copper , color such you can't really tell 3 feet away . i recommend this product	1
fountain isn't copper all . it brown plastic . it only looks slightly copper-like when lights off room lights fountain water make leaves look tad coppery . if you're looking real copper fountain , this ain't it ! other than , it nice fountain . small , it even quite bit water noise . pump quiet , but water flow good . there two speeds pump water flow . there lot places where water flows one height - which my cat loves . it could use some additional rocks , though	1
this good value . it appears durable . i would liked slightly larger pad , but it job	1
i bought this heating pad my husband because certain ailments he . he very pleased how well quickly it heated maintained warmth . most heating pads i bought past not heat all too good . very pleased found this pad would buy one our household or gift	1
i love this product , order more shortly . i especially impressed w/the speed delivered products . thank you .	1
i ordered it , but used it only little while until i switched formula . it useful , pain went away . price amazon bit higher than price you would find ordinary pharmacies	1
this must breastfeeding moms . i used it all time beginning . it helped prevent cracks soarness . great product safe baby	1
my 18 month daughter wearing these going 6 months . she not want lay down get changed ... when we've decided she needs change we say " let go potty get clean diaper " . she leads us into bathroom stands while we change her ( we make sure there plenty her look ) . rip , rip sides diaper , quick ( or not so quick ) wipe up then she helps us pull up new diaper ... even helps us " empty " into toilet flush . she not quite ready potty training , i don't think she knows yet when she actually going , but this helps her feel independent ... she also becoming comfortable toilet which hopefully help us when we actually potty training . let me just say this - changing breeze - one less place power struggle . amen ! oh- they also seem give her much more comfortable fit then cruisers	1
great shaver , allways you need replace blades every year or so keep it cutting close	1
besides all other 1 star reviews , i'd just like add this . even applicator garbage . i spread thin layer liquid over my lense , besides tiny bubbles , it also shed hairs applicator all over lense . unbelievable garbage	-1
really good cleanser . not listen one bad review -- sounds like he may allergic reaction . this stuff not harsh all	1
this my first pre-scrubber . i getting bumps just not getting good shave some creams lotions past . after hot shower , rub this , then cream go it . you'll surprised difference it makes shaving	1
after using old heating pad my grandmother 30 years i delighted find updated improved version same company . this pad much improved detachable control machine wash capability . it functions very efficiently timer automatically turn off . it hugs easily contures body . it adequate size cover entire area needing warmth . numbers control large enough read backlit seeing night . it well designed well made product	1
it doesn't get very hot/warm . how large it it didn't get but luke warm . other thank it would wonderful item its size	1
i bought this fountain my desktop work it great ! it very easy set up get it working few minutes right out box . it light , which illuminates water center fountain . fountain easy keep filled , it runs quietly , it provides some humidity during dry winter months . i am very pleased this product . i bought used several fountains , but this one easiest doesn't splash water all over desktop	1
things just seem going downhill my expereinces norelco . i bought my 6618x razor last october quite let down . first , box said it made holland like all my previous shavers ; inside unit it marked made china . next , don't even think this thing operate cord when battery gets flat -- you'll simply wait until it gets recharged . whose idea ? my advice look very carefully see if it operated cord well cordless ; this never concern my past norelco , either they battery or they didn't but they always worked cord . i imagine when battery gets worn out this shaver end up trash . pity	1
cartridges cartridges . however i few blades i swear blade went before beard . others marginal my wife made me use dull down so she could use them . these animals just not dull . gillette must count volume users because gillette would starve death waiting me use enough make production worth while . i use shaving soap just mark area covered there already some sort slick lubricating strip cartridge ; out this strip i would not know when toss cartridges out . there enough space blades allow easy cleaning . one almost look forward shaving . even though they seem last ever i would not want caught last minute out replacement .	1
got these my husband fun , he really likes them , but they little small behind his head . so if you wear large hat size , these aren't ideal . they good readers working his shop	1
these clic glasses great idea ... i first saw them csi-ny , sought them out , but they not made big enough ... they worked fine long i looking down , but soon i turned my head level , or looking up , glasses would " pop " apart . i purchased two pair , returned them both	-1
these glasses always attract attention ( mostly when i'm not wearing them ! ) people always amazed when they see me click my readers into place . lenses hang molded lucite-type back strap ( this part inflexible ) , they pivot so they point downward when not worn . put them , just pivot lenses 90 degree angle , lift them your eyes , voila , strong magnet center joins two lenses nose bridge . side pieces adjust retractable extension encased lucite . i've lost so many pairs readers , but these always right there around your neck , not getting left behind coffeeshop counter ! they not all compact , however , because mentioned before , backstrap molded piece . neck/back strap also makes them little hard wear while reading bed , so i put them after getting settled , seems work just fine . finally , even though they not most fashion-forward version eyewear , their convenience fun clicking them into place makes up their clunky looks .	1
my mother all people introduced me this scent when i 24 years old , so going 7 years now . it versatile it worn daytime into night . lasting power could little better , but it lingers . prior introduced burberry , my favorite sexy night scent classic opium . my fiance 7 years not like scents too musky , so he doesn't care my opium . however , he loves burberry london . i'm not good figuring out tones , but it musk tone it but it very soft but yet sexy well . musk tone not overpowering tone this scent , otherwise fiance would not love it much he . it also sophisicated professional scent , but again , soft sexy very versatile .	1
any one who wants check their blood pressure home reasonable accuracy , this one go . i skeptic when i bought it , but once i started using it , it accurate . 35$ , it good buy	1
i recently high blood pressure reading medical appointment ; it gave me bit scare . so , i ordered this hoping better undrestand blood-pressure impact different factors every day life . i chose model extra body fat measurement functions keep check too . when it arrived , i very pleasantly surprised ! it comes great hard-sided case , readings accurate ( least , far i tell ) , it fast easy . i love wrist ( vice arm ) cuff ! not sure battery life , but i'll using rechargeable batteries here out , so it shouldn't matter . ** bottom line ** if you any problems blood pressure all , you're probably aware these issues not just go away if ignored . seriously , consider buying this inexpensive , easy use wrist monitor . it time take care your health !	1
those pieces come out so far you can't get close shave . they only lasted couple shaves then fell off i am glad because now i use razor get close shave	-1
i very skeptical -- using two-blade razor years . but once you get used floppy head , fusion gives incredibly smooth , nick-free shave . i'm out buy second one my travel kit	1
both rayovac energizer selling rechargeable nimh d-cell batteries exact same power rating their nimh aa batteries . also , energizer customer relations reports their alkaline energizer max cell batteries 8x power rating these nimh rechargeables ( 20,500 mah versus 2,500 mah ) . even juice rechargeable nimh d-cell nearly three times power compared these batteries ( 7,000 mah versus 2,500 ) . i guess it " let buyer beware " ...	-1
i like this product two reasons : good price good size .	1
i like this curling brush 3 main reasons . one , it job . two , it starts heating up soon you plug it . other curling brushes , you turn switch make sure it starts heating up . three , it smallest curling brush i've found . it good size curling segment hair you work around your head . others too long . it packs nicely . i used able buy this curling brush supermarkets . i wasn't able find it there any more so i ordered 4 them amazon	1
don't cheap dish out extra $5 get something going get job righ t.t his very cheap looking , but it cheap so how i complain . i don't even know if i call material it made out plastic . it doesn't heat up past luke warm . i like my curling iron get so hot i can't touch it , this one so warm i just leave my finger it without getting burned . i'm pretty sure if i got any hotter than it already material it made would mel t.t he barrel itself very short . it like travel/mini iron . it best this just brush cord it . i gave it two stars because " you get what you pay " maybe this why i am only one give this product review everybody else knew better	1

product worked promised . buy it again gift someone . note : this product doesn't shave hair but just trims it down very acceptable level . very easy use . drains full charged battery less than ten minutes . better start using rechargeable batteries if you mind expense	1
these best curlers i've ever used . they heat very quickly , hold heat , excellent clip holds very well easy use . i prefer these curling iron because i put them , then go task . they lightweight great traveling . they heat up 2 minutes , curl very well . i like them so well , i bought extra sets gifts my daughters .	1

i tried electric razors ten years ago braun model but my skin too sensitive i received nicks cuts poor shave . three years ago , i tried again remington , it worked great my head -- not so great my face . lots nicks , spread rash . i especially disappointed it didn't get my neck very well . both shavers straight foil shavers , i thought they would shave closer than round heads . then , i purchased this norelco over 2 months ago , it worked like dream me . while first week wasn't especially close , it convenient i traveling work . third week , however , shave closer than my regular mach 3 blade shave ! one huge difference : i bought some letric shave pre-shave liquid , which makes whiskers stand up , also disinfects shaving heads . i haven't one cut , no rash , over 60 shaves this unit . since then , i used norelco every morning , letric shave , thrilled results . i also wondered whether my previous experience electric would better i $3.49 get pre-shave splash ! i agree one poster who complained plastic parts - only reason i didn't give product 5 stars . i don't really know how long this unit run . i know 2 months , i already saved more this unit than disposable blades would cost . , travel snap . charges quickly , runs quietly , usually holds its charge entire week . i'm very happy customer	1
electric razor it cuts close fast . recharges well lasts .	1
i went through several reviews comparisons braun 360 norelco latest shaver before finalizing panasonic vortex . i am really glad i decided this one . looks great . it very lightweight , ergonomic . nise level acceptable , not loud or disturbing . swivel head really helps around chin edges . it shaves good or better than mach-3 razor i using before . battery life excellent . i use it dry shaver once every two days use 10% charge each shave . so charge last 15 days . cleaning very easy . it cleaned regular hand liquid soap or cleaning system comes it used . i use system once or twice month it nice job . overall very satisfied would definitely recommend buy if considering electric shaver	1
got panasonic replace older braun . i'm razor guy , but i use electric occasionally . shave this panasonic gives best i ever electric . couple passes , shave approaches closeness razor , but no chance cuts or scrapes . if i want real close shave , razor still wins , but panasonic close second	1
finally , electric , long user willing spend little more time process , provides shave smooth close blade , without all nicks cuts . expensive but worth it ; six stars if option	1
i bought this try get constant " knots " out my wife neck lower back , boy ... let me tell ya ' ... it sure saved me lot time sore hands/fingers ! i used spend almost good 45 minutes trying get " knots " worked out quite often . percussion heat feature sure helps now . this switch 1 . ) off 2 . ) massage 3 . ) massage/heat . it your thumb ( if strapped your right hand ) . variable speed switch rotary dial would end your ring finger . i think only drawback we find this it only 1 heat attachment . other 2 screw attachments made out hard " pliable " ( i say loosely ) hard rubber/plastic compound not capable conducting heat . only red attachment . inside percussion head massager ( where heads screwed onto ) metal shaft where heat emits . only attachment metal center contacts also conduct heat red attachment . black ones not . if you attached them accidentally hit switch past massage into heat zone , you might some melted black attachments !!	1
my new homedics mt-pa palm percussion massager arrived several weeks ago . i using it 4 or 5 times day , every day . i purchased it primarily my neck shoulder areas , but soon found it works wonderfully my feet , arms other places , bringing great relief sore muscles . me , one best things massager , its sensitive adjustibility , which ranges light touch , full , deep , penetrating , pulsing massage , reaching muscles none my other massagers . i love this product . but then i expected it , because it made homedics . this company absolutely hands down , best manufacture making these type products industry today . i always count their products made well , perform highest levels ; so far , always advertised . this my fourth homedics massager i purchased over past six years-and i never disappointed . i highly recommend this hand held massager anyone who needs quick relief stressed muscles . surely one three included attachments should bring relief what ails you . final thought : i really appreciate this company keeping cost its products so affordable .	1
these brushes great substitute expensive professional brushes out there . you get this whole kit cost one high end brushes these nice soft , look great , comfortable your hand . if your looking quality brush set mere fraction cost this set you	1
this product eliminated one step . however , one step took long two steps	1
i disappointed this model . i used my friend wet dry it fantastic . i ordered wet or dry because decrease price $200 $129 . but i should known better ( there reason decrease price ) it not work well wet dry - all . it snagged my hair didn't eliminate frizz - any $20 flat iron would work just same . however , i exchange it medium duality model difference amazing . much better !	1
these glasses perfect someone who keep reading glasses handy . i seen them sale spain $70 italy $100 . amazon price clics certainly best far . only suggestioni they not good airplane reading because if you restyour head seat , back frame moves forward glasseswill not centered properly . they , however , great conversation starter	1
absoultly satified product they always hand no searching my glasses any more they comfortly hanging around my neck easy put place . i would recomend them anyone active job needed reading or close work	1
karastase makes excellent hair products . i like this shampoo , it leaves my hair very silky it great rich lather nice smell . only downside keratase products quite expensive everyday use . i other shampoos i use my first lather , then finish this one . small amount product goes long way . if you leave lather your hair several minutes , it works better	1
i love it !! it works great sinuses !! i just added couple drops essential oils inhaled warm mist couple times day my sinus pressure totally disappeared !! i use it every time i feel congestion or sinus pressure infection never comes	1

this product great instant relief itchy scalp . never leaves your hair or scalp oily . i recommend this anyone who sensitive skin and/or scalp problems	1
product fine far flavor , solubility nutrition . i no idea if it works this seriously 5 day supply . bottle looks big , but it only 2/3 full those 2/3 mostly air . i am certain you could fit entire contents this huge jug into coke . container says 15 servings directions state drink 3 4 servings day . 4 times day this isn't even 4 day supply . i strongly recommend skipping this stuff . i am serious athlete taken quite few different supplements , some which worked some didn't . even those worked not $120-$150 per month . i guess you already pro athlete able afford buying enough this stuff it actually work	-1
best thing muscle milk taste . i first tried rocky road which awesome , than i got cookies cream which wasn't good my opinion . cytosport reccomends it pre/post workout , but i would say it better pre-bed since it mostly casein protein . whey better option pre/post workout . either way you take it , taste awesome ... best tasting protein i've tried yet .	1
very good flavor consistency , but best all , very good formula you actually feel difference consuming it or not	1
jet clean shaving system included package this shaver oversold . structure if shaver head such it easily cleaned warm water immediately after use , so there appears no additional cleaning required . shaver quite similar earlier models same type , so very little difference quality shave noted . placing battery charging hardware plug-in module so only low voltage present shaver cord safety improvement	1
i am very satisfied product purchasing process	1
this product works very well smooth . it feels soft not feel like it pulling hairs my face ( when used one day growth ) . ability rinse razor under water nice feature . cleaning solution seems use up very quickly	1
item just i wanted . no problems . delivery fairly prompt . thanks great service	1

i purchased hairtopia total couple months ago . after few weeks , i got sick huge regimen ( 10 capsules day ! ) so i just started taking one pill each once per day . first , i just noticed my hair thicker , i growing more hair ( like around my hairline - i got little curly fine hairs weren't there before ) . i now widow peak , didn't before . after month using product , people started saying me " wow ! your hair getting so long !! " very nice . it also ( immediately ) made my fingernails grow twice fast they used . i highly recommend this product . gave four stars because price unreasonable regimen	1
basically , this shaver gives me just close shave any high-quality electric shaver . no better , no worse . it never close one those flashy gillette blades , though . i'm one those guys pretty thick , fast growing beard , so this concern me every morning . i've definitely gone through my share various types electrics razors . hands down , there huge convenience factor added self-cleaning . no mess . no hassles . just drop it charger , push button , let it its thing hour . financial standpoint , its mixed bag when comparing standard blades . your typical fusion blade costs $3-$4 , based type beard you , single blade last week , give or take . so per use , its definitely cheaper go electric . however , such high up-front costs purchase braun , changing cleaning cleaning fluid each month around $4/each , it take few years break-even . ( fact , if you want get really technical , inflation interest rates considered , you may never really break-even . i actually distorted enough run these calculations excel . ) however , purely psychological sense , you don't feel like you're getting robbed each time you buy more razors , you just get robbed once . so , summary , solid electric shaver , cool added value convenience , its kind your call whether you think you'll saving money or not	1
very good product . i thinking price little high but this shaver delivers advertised	1
daughter braces ... her teeth never looked better . much improved just using standard toothbrush	1
i received this toothbrush christmas present . i thought getting electronic toothbrush , but i not any research . any case , i eager try it . when i first used it , it took few seconds get used it . i thought it tickled my gums , but very shortly i realize how much " sonic " action toothbrush working cleaning your teeth you just make small circles brush let sonic action rest . i used it couple times already my teeth feel cleaner . i also find it fun use so i end up brushing my teeth lot longer than regular brush . i went see how much refills wal-mart they $7.97 . this why i gave it 4 stars not five . $8 every three months bit more espensive than regular brush ( i usually get free target when they tooth paste / tooth brush packages )	1
i put this lotion night immediately feel my face more moisturized . morning my face also feels softer , smoother not tired days when i not use it . it really worked me !!! it non greasy my fine lines not noticeably . i think this great product	1
this cream wonderful , regenerating serum feels like no night cream i've ever used . i just love it	1
its smooth , fine , pleasing scent . it would better if it longer lasting	1
so far after useing shaver one month , i find it better than most . true review would take 6 months use . my main concern life shaving foil . remington , altough good close shaver , shaving head disintergrates after few months they very expensive replace	1
so far , i am impressed this razor which gives me close , good shave . i gave this razor 4 star rating instead 5 star rating because it not come charging stand , which forces me leave it plugged ( plug end large ) lying bathroom sink , which makes sink area look cluttered . my older braun came charging stand , which made much neater look it sat sink area	1
i got this product my step-granddaughter ( she 13 ) christmas . she absolutely loves it - she able stand there round brush " straighten " her hair she blows it dry . i'm going order one myself now .	1

there so many varied reviews this product depending which version you clicked ! here what i've found mine : first , this intended work adult acne , occasional blemish . sorry teens , this probably isn't best choice you unless you only occasional break-out . second , this only works new pimples so when you get it , don't expect ones you currently suddenly disappear . it works best when you first notice pimple appearing , especially just starting get sore , slight red spot stage . sad , it actually work , provided you keep first two rules mind ! two days after i received mine , i noticed tell tale red spot beginning form , i zapped it not only it not get worse , next morning , it completely gone ! plus , portion pink version goes breast cancer research if you buy it company ( not sure amazon ) there 30-day money back guarantee . all all , great product	1
magnet solid , frame wiggle perfectly make it clic fit just like picture shows . lenses clear functional . however , they need give bit more space accomodate larger heads , since it get snug this not your usual glasses . notice frame encircles head , making head size issue . plus side- glasses won't fall off when you bend forward , they stay around your neck after you unclick ' em , they functional	1
i fibromyalgia my heating pads my closest friends . : ) seriously , this best heating pad ever . i think best part it strap stretches -- works great neck/shoulders well hip/low back . because it flexible it doesn't " crimp " up like regular heating pads when you them bent even slightly . i am purchasing my second one now so i use two once--they're simply best heating pad there ! :	1

i looking through amazon try find straightner similar this one because i couldnt find this exact one but once i found it i bought it immediately .... my cousin this one i would go her house use it every once while but now i got my own i remember why i wanted one so bad .... so ... straight point-heats up fast-straightens hair like ... " woah " -its plates big so it more less time-has high heat settings-the only thing bugs me smell ... it smells like metal .. but im guessing its because its new cuz my cousins doesnt smell like it ... anywho great product work every cen	1
i love this flat iron ! i never used something made my hair so straight ! it heats up very quickly straightens my thick , curly hair 15-20 minutes , record time comparison other hair straighteners . buy this product , it not waste money	1
only one air brush . so this one best , but it nothing compare , working just fine last 4 month	1
this great green addition every morning . it kept me getting sick gives me energy . i mix it apple or crangrape juice it tastes great .	1
this best flat iron i've ever ! it even keeps my hair shiny straight humid weather . i don't use hair products came it because they smell like men cologne , but i love flat iron	1
this long lasting item . i bought one used 10 years ago it still works just fine . if i find where my son put it , because he loves play it . also it works best small items , like candy wrapers when your trying clean up yard . it large items like cans also . avoid one folds if you , because there really no need fold it up . just find some place hang it nail .	1
i bought set- hair dryer flat iron . this far worthwhile investment . i deliberated few years over spending this much now i wish i it earlier ! it takes five minutes dry my hair dryer so quiet never feels hot . my hair smoother too- no flyaways . flat iron amazing ! i get little flippy ends i could not get my cheap drugstore flat iron . truly worth money	1
i got this item gift christmas my son i love it . it everything it says it . i would highly recomend this product .	1
i job last nineteen years requires me stand my feet majority my workday . recently , i noticed end my shift my feet hurt more than usual . they began throb . two weeks ago i decided purchase whirlpool foot spa similar one salon where i get my pedicures . i wanted pamper rejuvenate my arhing feet home my own convenience without added cost going nail shop . my criterion : ( 1)water level deep enough immerse my ankles , ( 2)powerful water jets , ( 3)a heating element would enable water stay heated periods up two hours . aqua-jet foot spa met all my requirements . addition , handles make it very easy move lift spa when full . this unit bit more expensive than other foot spas market , however , well worth money	1
three girls household , one organizer rack not enough ! this takes away clutter three bottles , gives you place hold your razor where it slip out all time , allows you convenience not open close caps your hair products trying retrieve them you're trying shower . it nice clean look well . only downside , mirror fogs . but , overall , i'd recommend it anyone	1
two young girls who seem go through bath products like water ... this little baby already paid iteself cutting down my shampoo , conditioner bath gel bills ! i used bath products every couple weeks , kids ( 5 8 ) would go through handfuls product when using bottles they came -- now they pump enough job we waste much , much less . i purchased inexpensive dispenser lowes girls ' tub area -- but after only 2 months springs pump began rust everything pumped out yucky rust colored- so i replaced it genuine ' dispenser ' brand ( same brand i seen hotels ) i one dispenser more than year no problem , two more nearly 4 months am very heppy them . now , we one every shower tub house . truly great product !	1
i love read bed before going sleep , but propping pillows not comfortable i wanted . this really great because you enjoy heated back massage same time . concentrated light great - doesn't disturb my husband	1
lisse crepe microfiber hair turbans aquis very soft , absorbant , they dry quickly . " diva darling " hair towels not quite nice . hair turbans stay neatly your head more convenient than big fluffy towel . if turban gets sopping wet , means it doing its job ! my parents taught me it impolite come breakfast without towel covering my wet hair . this turban not only great home , but also college dorms .	1
bought 12 these several(9 ? ) years ago wife , daughter , sister , sisters-in-law , mother-in-law nieces . i think 8 survived . everyone thinks i am santa ! want new ones	1
i told my sinus surgeon take hot , steamy shower each morning . i am bath person my shower doesn't make much steam , anyway . i searched suitable alternative . all i found locally cosmetic type steamers . search amazon turned up mabis steam inhaler . it puts out large amounts steam . amount temperature steam easily adjusted . machine easy use compact . steam easily directed where desired . not wimpy , facial machines found local pharmacies . but , it used facials well lot more steam output than most . easy use clean , works great . one my best purchases ever !	1
bubbles great , but heater not even keep really hot water warm . water cooled down cold 5 minutes	-1
not accurate all . users saying they would get reading , step out step back get same reading . because there some sort memory ( probably saves it few seconds ) . i tried it taking reading , then taking reading 1 lb book my hands . it gave me same reading before . other hand , it pretty cheap it looks good	1
what i ordered arrived sooner than i expected , it well wrapped just they way i expected it . thank yo	1
this shaver better than any i long time . i skeptical because it cheaper than others i , but it works like charm me	1
i looking something less abrasive than regular manual toothbrush i tend agressive brusher . i very pleased this product my first try electronic toothbrushes . it compact i've never problem it holding charge . refills bit expensive but same case all sonic refills across board	1
i found this flosser convenient alternative traditional dental floss , however , i still prefer cleaning power traditional waxed dental floss . people braces this such nice tool easily get teeth long your teeth aren't too cramped . my son uses this it good job , although i've tried it , it not something i purchasing myself . it cheap price , however , i would recommend giving it try . each disposable flossing heads used least couple times if desired . my only complaint you cannot choose color unfortunately my teenage son received girl color : purple ! ** update ** my sons dentist said this flosser irritating his gums . he change his flossing tip daily so i only assume it vibrating motion his gums don't like . we since switched regular waxed floss , good quality brand called glide , his gums feel better .	1
i just wanted write review huggies diapers general because really bad review below . my son , they only diapers work well -- no leaking ever , while pampers sieve him driving us crazy . we also problems other brands . however , i know other parents opposite problem -- pampers work well while huggies leak . it all just based shape your particular child . i apparently huggies child nothing else . he very slender maybe that why . maybe pampers better stockier kids . i don't know . anyway , just wanted throw my two cents huggies since they wonder diaper us	1
this superior humidifier ; it quiet , humidifies room quickly , easy use clean . i would recommend , any humidifier , you empty out tank let it dry daily , so prevent buildup . but so far , we've used it month seen no buildup . one best features digital readout lets you see how much humidity room . it more expensive than your average humidifier you might buy target or cvs , but it so much better last much longer .	1
i always great experience buying amazon . however , this time , i very bad luck . product arrived factory direct no receipt . this would not issue if product wasn't defective . unfortunately , i got faulty humidifier leaked all over my floor . i could not easily send it back , since i didn't receipt . very frustrating	-1
i bought 12 these 4 years ago .. use exclusively mole chaser devices ( slow continuous drain ) . recently surprised they've started lose charge within days , even fail charge ( accu charger ) .. not quite " charge over 1000 times " i sold . over four years , i recharge them every once month .. which works out 48 times before they gave up ghost . buy more these things , until reading other reviews seeing other hi-end rechargeables ( ie maha ) . not sure what i'll next	1
i looking something like this because my wife always asking me scratch her head . after reviewing many options i picked this particular model it worked out perfectly , she loves it . vibrating tings ( tongs ? ) really give her scalp deep massage , she use it herself ( or i drive her ) . design also nice , arms rotate so whole unit pretty flat ( good packing ) since they're copper they bent fit any head shape or size . overall very worthwhile investment , recommended anyone looking head scratcher / massager	1
this fountain so beautiful , lighting dancing against wall , reflecting water . however , after 5 months , light burned out then motor quit . but price , i still think it good deal , i am buying	1
price great scale works fine . occasionally we get error message instead weight , but just step off back it works fine . i would recommend this scale	1
fits nicely into decor our full bath-very nutral color . compact easy storage . seems consistant accurat	1
i bought this drown out noise while my baby sleeps it just . although , i wish now i gotten sound machine more options , or different variety - some you even combine different sounds customize your own . i really only use " rain " sound . i would like " ocean " sound except there loud seagulls background , i'm afraid they'll wake my baby , since i turn machine up loud enough mask outside noise . other sounds heartbeat , waterfall , summer night , rainforest . my baby seemed like heartbeat sound , but i sleep same room it kept me awake - me it sounds more like someone beating drum . waterfall doesnt sound like much all - just your basic static white noise sound , other two nice background ambiance , but they dont drown out anything . i gave this 4 stars though , because it works what i bought it , sound quality great , it simple - easy use , it very portable , it battery or ac option . now i sound machine i dont know how i got without one - especially baby household barking dogs	1
while thinking which shaver set buy we came across body bare shaver set . we ordered item came us quickly . my wife tried it out could not believe how well it actually worked . after she shaved she waited 30 minutes there no discomfort or burning feeling . smooth skin last . waht great product ! larry	1
water pik sinus attachment only thing given me relief i need . living midwest you need help your sinsus problems . thank you water pik helping me	1
i purchased this set attachments " waterpik new professional ultra dental water jet " amazon last week . these tips not work this waterpik . base tip , end inserted into waterpik handle , too small . both tips this set too small . not really worth sending back amazon so i think i'll just use my trusty dremel tool some plastic cement swap base one tips came waterpik	-1
shave very close comfortable . cleaning soap water great . haven't tried wet shave yet . trimmer not seem great mustaches , motor seems running fast clean cut	1
it everything you said it would	1
i live condo very , very small washer dryer , so i don't room or time much laundry . regular towels , i only put three washer , it ends up taking 2 hours wash dry them ! these towels perfect apartment-style living ! i throw this towel washer ton room all other things i need washed , too ! absorbancy factor great , my hair not frizzy after keeping my hair wrapped towel , it pretty soft . my husband i very thin , so i thought this size towel would great drying off , but unfortunately , they barely wrap around our bodies enough tie them side wear them around house . so , i would use these towels baby towel or very large hand/face towel instead bath towe . i'll definitely buy larger one future	1
this towel great . i received it gift , love it . it really dry my hair quicker than traditional towel , result , means much less blow drying time . not only i get ready faster , but my hair starting look healthier due less blow-drying . my only complaint would it doesn't hold turban very well . but it definitely worth purchase , regardless !	1
i need unscented dryer sheets . i used bounce free , but they very difficult find . i googled unscented dryer sheets found all free clear dryer sheets ( i use all free clear small mighty detergent ) . i surprised find all made dryer sheets . anyway , i ordered them amazon ( fantastic price ) they great !!	1
this only dryer sheets i use since i such sensitive skin . it wonderful product alot less itching it	1
i love this curling iron . i gets hot very fast doesn't leave those creases your hair . it also got rid frizziness . it one cheapest which always plus	1
pretty decent trimmer , easy use it pack punch ; but most amazing quality how quite it ! very good price , very solid construction . could not ask better hair trimmer .	1
good value price . other wahl clipper offer i or 2 more pieces which usless charge abour 5 bucks more , but clipper same . so far clipper works well . i'm only one using it i'm satisfied	1
i purchased product similar bikini touch use facial hair removal ( eyebrow upper lip ) . i not like it . i paid more it it kept breaking . bikini touch works eyebrow upper lip held together nicely . i not used it bikini area nor i want . i like this product . it exactly what i wanted it not break	1
reviewer below mentioned , this device neither shaves nor removes hair around bikini area , but instead seems trim it down small point . this ok if all you want not long hairs creeping around , but i expecting much smoother result , this thing doesn't cut it ! i very dark hair , it still visible after trimming , plus it hardly seemed touch thicker hairs ! where this work quite well my upper thighs , where hair lighter finer , but i other things remove hair there ! all-in-all , i'm disappointed this device wouldn't recommend it place waxing , epilating , or just plain shaving	1
my daughter i both enjoyed soaking our feet . i guess previous reviewers overly high expectations . yes , you fill it hot water . big deal . then it ten minutes relaxation . it splash over sides if you overfill . most difficult part using this product fill it water then carry unit your seat	1
all women agree this cologne best ever . smell very distinct definite turn !	1
contrary previous post , i numerous occasions when i approached question , ' what you wearing ? ' . this amazing scent , pleasant mix subtleness reserved masculinity . course , fragrances dont always react person chemistry way they would . i'd say try small bottle when compliments start coming , then you buy larger bottle	1
tastes better than most candy bars no refined sugar or artificial ingredients	1
its sooo good . yummy , filling , natural . what more could you ask	1
after five children , i tried every diaper market one time or . each child required different diaper except my last two girls , they both able wear luvs without leaks . my now 9 month old son different story . he grew out size three diapers end his seventh month . he started crawling around luvs cut into his upper thighs they leaked . bought these size 4 now we all happy . no red marks anywear no leaks !!! i just wish i would ordered diapers through amazon starting five years ago ... it so cost effective it great them brought my front door my friendly ups driver . what great deal !!	1

i recently moved into new apartment dismayed find tiny , wall-mounted showerhead unit . i quickly made my way amazon purchased this item , decision which i applaud myself daily . settings great , it amazingly powerful , plastic seating showerhead not issue . unless you plans hang heavy , metal objects showerhead , i see no reason not purchase this product .	1
i ordered this brushed nickel version although massaging feature weak , i really like most settings . i very large stand alone shower stall so it nice take this off wall spray down entire shower this very long cord . i think massaging feature would work better if i remove flow meter comes pre-installed reduce water waste . instructions detailed how so , so if you like true shower massage , this may work you increasing amount water flow	1
i used wonder how i could get my hair look just like when i leave beauty salon . now i . i getting so much compliments my hair since i using farouk chi turbo big 2 inch ceramic flat iron hair straightener . it leaves my hair shining without adding any additional hair sheen like i ued . my sister ceramic iron maxi but it use tear my hair out . i love my iron ... it worth investment .	1
my couusins this product but instead 2 " they only 1 " i loved it when they tried it myself i wanted get one christmas . christmas came no chi straightener lot money my brother gave me amazon gift cift card . i loked weeks something spend but not much good . then week after i found this straightener sale i begged if i could buy it since i hot tool sucks badly because they heated slowly it takes long time straighten my hair . after trying my cousins ' iron i decided buy it . well i'll give u some tips before u think buying this ... #1 if u thin hair go 1 " chi straightner(works great my cousins who thin hair ) , #2 if u really thick curly wavy hair u should buy 2 " yurself , #3 i read other reviews safety conditions i bought it fast possible because i wanted buy this before sale over so u should read customers reviews check safety conditions(some said iron won't heat up after week or so but my cousins ' iron still work perfectly ) , #4 if u really thick hair u should start under yur hair until it yur whole hair(works me :) ! ) #5 don't leave it out when u take shower since it so expensive customers complains repair price . b-t-w i really thick , wavy hair it always frizzy even morning when i took shower night before so now i pull it up into low pony it looks so straight when i took rubber off but i rather straighter hair this chi . so follow my tips if u buying this curly/thick/wavy/frizzy hair this chi make great impression yur hair it lays straight until u wash yur hair . so buy this join world beauty !!	1
this my third waterpik it quietest yet . all units i worked well my dentist agrees . i would rated this unit 5 if it not fact prior units water hoses both wore out started leaking . it costs almost much new unit replace them . both previous units , hose wore out where it connects nozzle these units you replace both hose nozzle	1
used this prroduct 3 months . not find it demished lines but very rich but not greasy . great moisturizer	1
excellent product ; feels great hand , performs reliably . however , cord miserably stiff . i replaced it supple rubber cord	1
overall i am satisfied this dryer . i alot hair , but it color treated so it dry side dries easily . i would not recommend this dryer someone who alot hair or hair takes awhile dry . this dryer much quieter than my last one .	1
tanita 6102 fast reliable . it typically displays result only few seconds . i tried several heart rate monitors , i found this works faster better than more expensive models . it also capable displaying higher rates than other monitors	1

all whitening products i've used , this best . however , goop inside trays doesn't spread too effectively over surface teeth instead spills out into your mouth . they would need work , especially price they charge these	1
this brush easy use , timer very helpful . i great reviews my dental hygenist since i've using oral . it priced right too	1

it true . this first cleanser i found which actually works while same time not caused my already dry skin flake . it not miracle liquid though it not make acne disappear instantly but it certainly helps over time . i using it two years now . it leaves my face feeling refreshed clean . one weird thing i noticed this all other acne cleansers first it seems work extremely well after few months use effectiveness sort trails off into normality . don't discouraged , though . continued use twice daily definitely reduces acne breakouts . me , it doesn't entirely stop them but it still helps lot . it doesn't expire over time so don't worry buy 3 pack order get good price . i use up one tube 1.5 2 months	1

i damaged my old syncro , since it beyond warranty , i decided get new one after long period shaving blade razors ( getting sick them ) . i fair amount research find " best " razor based user comments/ratings , online reviews , etc . syncro kept coming up again again . although instructions braun tell you it may take up 30 days your beard fully adjust electric razor/syncro specifically , i impressed after first few days ! it maintains strong charge ( based amount time i use it each morning ) least week . since i travel abroad occasionally work leisure , it incredibly helpful charge cord " universal . " good thinking . compared last syncro , i noticed actual shaving head more tightly attached razor itself . screen looks ( feels ) more durable comfortable , raised ridges side razor seem bit more pronounced therefore much easier grip . shaver very easy clean , various settings adjustments make it incredibly versatile useful edging around sideburns getting those tough spots under your nose your neck . great product - i'll recommending this everyone	1
that low-power or charge-level indicator . when it running out charge , it starts out ok , then dies during shave . that annoying . my old braun lcd charge level display . i've getting 5 shaves per charge , so i just remember charge it periodically . oh , when removing protective cover , it tends pop up shaving head , drop shavings . otherwise , i like it , getting nice close shaves , smooth operation , good trimmer edge , comfortable	1

i bought this because i sick tripping over all different shampoos conditioners i like trade off . i like able switch back forth , but hated pick which ones would " lucky " shower versions , which would put under sink . it always turned out i'd way too many bottles shower then i found this ! what perfect solution . not only it store all what i'm using , but if you're one those parents who always find yourself saying your children , " what you doing .... drinking shampoo ??? " . it dispenses perfect amount , though i paid twice this much somewhere else , i'd it again heart beat . its neat , its compact , it works perfectly . i'm frankly thinking giving it gift those up coming events i'm not sure what they need or want . update : i've this few months now , savings shampoo more than paid it . it dispenses just right amount , results big savings .	1

bayer name-brand aspirin . any brand-name drug cost least double equivalent generic aspirin . i give this one-star rating not because it poor product , rather , because it so expensive . dosage 325 mg , taken two time , normal dose . aspirin wonder-drug , very first analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication hit market over 100 years ago . it mild moderate pain treats many different conditions such arthritis , bone inflammation , joint pain , even reduces fever . aspirin causes blood platelets not adhere each other , thus it " thins " blood prevents blood clots forming . aspirin thus used emergency treatment heart attacks strokes . some folks take " baby " aspirin ( 81-160 mgs ) each day prevent blood clots forming . aspirin actually acetyl-salicylic acid . manufacturers alter structure aspirin slightly grant it different properties terms its digestion , make digestion easier . some buffer it antacids while others coat tablet coating prevents its digestion stomach ( like ecotrin ) . regular aspirin , without any buffering or coatings tolerated most people , but some cannot take it without severe stomach upset . these folks , buffered form god-send . unfortunately , aspirin fell out favor 60 70 when reye syndrome developed some children ( under age 16 ) who took aspirin while they flu and/or chickenpox . 30% children affected died many more permanent brain damage . because reye syndrome , alternate analgesics placed market , premier tylenol . there no reason fear using aspirin if you adult , reye syndrome only occurred children under 16 years age . usual dose aspirin 350 mg , " extra-strength form 500 mg . most adults easily tolerate dose 650 mg ( 2 tablets ) every 4 hours maximum daily dose 5,200 mg . ( some rheumatoid arthritis take up 7200 mg/day doctor supervision ) . there no additional benefit taking more than 1,000 mg every 4 hours . increasing dose beyond this point only increase toxicity aspirin . aspirin should avoided people taking blood-thinning medications , those stomach ulcers , used caution insulin-dependent diabetics . allergies develop aspirin well . never mix aspirin any non-steroidal anti-inflammatories , such ibuprofen , there no pain benefit gastric upset chance greatly increased . don't mix aspirin alcohol either , it hard stomach . used properly , aspirin terrific medication . i prefer buy my aspirin generic form . one pays more aspirin if it produced name-brand manufacturer . however , big-manufacturers also package aspirin some buffered forms some people tolerate better . jim " konedog " koenig	-1
involved healthcare almost 20 years i know too well what impact poor diet your health . my own father , meat potatoes man , diagnosed colon cancer almost two years ago . his physician recommended he increase his intake fruit , vegetables , beans whole grains . needless say he ignored this advice . i able convince him least add dose metamucil every day . he mixes it his orange juice claims he can't even tell it there . thankfully , we not reoccurrence colon cancer . if you going eat diet deficient fruit , vegetables beans whole grains , least add little metamucil your diet . your lipid levels ( cholesterol ) colon thank you . just certain follow directions not take metamucil same time you take any medications . also , certain increase your fluid intake when you begin taking metamucil make certain it doesn't effect causing constipation . i view metamucil insurance policy your continued good health .	1
this may best tasting supplement ever . there no funky protein taste or after taste . i mix it water it tastes like very good chocolate milk . i couldn't give it perfect marks because it little hard mix . i use shaker always least little clumping . but taste so good i don't really mind .	1

i owned this product past few months . i love brush sizes they interchangeable . great tool loosening curly hair softer look . quick curl-release great . it also several temperature settings . . . low/high heat cool setting curl . barrels also cool down fairly quickly after use . my only complaint plastic power switch . it pops off times tempermental making connection start-up switching temperature settings . it may just my unit or could flaw product . check out switch before purchase , if possible . i paid only $17.00 + tax walmart . i am looking similar product same features but sturdier construction . this one not worth $30+ .	1
i used this shaver over 3 years no problems all . i found wet shave ( lather up ) gives best results both under-arm area legs . use pop up trimmer longer hair- hair just glide under foil if you try shave without it . course its not close blade- because its not blade . my only complaint it costs much replace cutters ( which come new foil well ) it buy new razor	1
while i'd used swiffer before , i hadn't used wet cleaning pads before today i blown away ! original swiffer sweeper makes quick job sweeping , especially dust hair , which leave your floors bare mopping becomes much cleaner less hassle free job . mopping cloths put swiffer sweeper same manner dry cloths . they're extremely similar except these , obviously , wet soaked cleaning solution . also , mopping cloths little scrubbing edge ( which i found i didn't even use ) . i've used swiffer wet jet which made especially mop but think i prefer this method . like regular mop , cleaning solution already pad ( or sponge traditional sense ) compared sot wet jet where you spray it often cannot see exactly where it goes . also , regular swiffer sweeper made metal components , compared plastic handle wet jet , feels much more sturdy while it still light weight . this allows you scrub little harder , little more " elbow grease " than wet jet . mopping pads also feel like they're more secure swiffer sweeper stay still better . velcro adhesion wet jet doesn't seem this way thinner mopping pads just good job wet jet pads , without coming apart like wet jet pads often , feeling like diaper or taking up much room . my 3 small rooms , 1 mopping pad almost , but not quite , trick . it easy scrub off spots wet mopping pads actually took care few spots wet jet left previously , not matter how hard i scrubbed . i'm shocked i've never used this product before - it great i would recommend it anyone . i bought mine stores didn't deal messy shipping but i would never purchase wet product like this through mail or online ; it much more convenient simply buy it store .	1

while discs little difficult get them adhere , especially tongue , they really lessen duration severity these horribly painful canker sores . i hope this product stays around forever	1
after spending full week pain , point where 6-8 advil day made little difference , i read reviews this product ( different size , http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b0002m50yw/ref=pd_sbs_hpc_1/104-9592068-8075113?%5fencoding=utf8v=glancen=3760901 ) decided give it try . box says it works best prevent sores forming , but it worked wonders my fully-developed canker sore , which size dime inside my lower lip , sliced through middle so nerve endings exposed -- ( sorry ; i know that really gross , but seriously , it excruciating ) . after 2 hours i felt numbing relief ; after 6 hours i could tell canker sore started heal over ; few hours after , sore developed protective blister-like covering over it , i could actually eat solid foods again after week starbucks jamba juice ( boy i hungry cranky this week , esp . since even drinking through straws hurt ) . i diligent putting discs consecutively , using 5-6 10 hours -- amazing recovery well worth it . this product actually heals canker sores . last product i used ( orabase colgate ) actually aggravated sore because it essentially like applying nail glue raw surface -- incredibly painful traumatic when it dislodged , which it after 30 minutes best . note : cankermelts not liquid , but necco wafer-like discs , ranging 3/8 " 5/8 " diameter . some may find them bit awkward manuveur first , esp . if your sores pretty small , but i encourage you read directions carefully , give them shot . addition actually healing sores , active ingredient these licorice root , not 2-octyl cyanoacrylate ( aka nail glue ) like orabase . i'll take mild licorice taste over toxic glue any day . whoever invented this product deserves medal , or , very least ( seeing no " healer disgusting canker sores " medal exists ) , sell billion these . i'm stocking up them like cold-eeze	1

i tried many types ear plugs these best . they made out soft silicon , so you mold them fit your ear . stay put comfortable . foam-type ear plugs tend pop out , they very scratchy me . non-moldable rubber-y ones even worse ; they hurt my ears don't block out sound very well . " mack earpillows " waterproof , so you swim without getting water your ears . ( good swimming bathing children who " tubes " their ears , too ) . your sleep-environment dead quiet ( except those little voices your head ! ) normal room . if you dealing partner-snoring , people watching tv room , or like , " mack " masks much , too . very handy travel . only drawbacks i know fact they don't kill all noise ( nothing ) , they don't last forever ( nothing either . ) you throw them away when they get dirty , but if you keep them case , they'll stay clean quite while . sometimes i pick hair out them after i wake up because my hair tends get caught them when i sleep , which annoying . everything sticks them , so , if they fall floor , they end up looking like nasty boogers	1

i got this gift love it !! 2 my kids small ear canals frequent ear infections so we not use ear thermometer ( you can't use it kids under 1 anyway ) . waiting rectal reading squrimy baby challengei shocked read bad reviews site . my husband some problems first ( like these people complaints ) but i figured out he pulling it away our kids head still holding down button second , which then adding calculations room temperature . depending how long he continued hold it down after pulling it away , it really made temperatures flucuate . my readings would only vary . 1- . 2 degrees . so practice couple times when you first get it . ( across forehead , down temple stop infront ear ) . before you pull it up , let go button !!!. it beep soon you let button go your reading . it takes some practice really quick ( our peditricion super quick , but they practice dozens times day ) . if forhead sweaty you also just hold it second or so behind ear , but again wait beep before pulling away . our kids don't min	1

braun irt 4520 ear thermometer excellent device taking temperatures , especially small children infants . most families oral thermometer some use other types , like rectal or those placed under armpit . these other thermometers generally ok certain age groups but when it comes very young , ear thermometer best option . braun irt 4520 one best market . this thermometer gives accurate results 30 45 seconds . they way it accomplishes its task using infrared technology measure level heat generated eardrum other tissue . some may question ear accurate place measure ones ' body temperature but according many medical experts , ear actually provides greater accuracy than oral other types thermometers . all pluses this device , most important among them ease use . babies generally don't like anything placed inside their ears but they don't resist this type thermometer like they others . i tried using armpit style thermometer but squirming crying too much . this , there still little bit annoyance both your baby you but it nothing compared aggravation caused other types thermometers . occasion , this thermometer may problem producing accurate measurement when it , it let you know display panel . example , if tip isn't inserted properly ear , you get error code " pos " , indicating positioning not secure . if surrounding air too hot or too cold ( needs 50 104 degrees fahrenheit ) , you get " err " error message . if person temperature far too high or too low , ( outside 93.2 108 degrees fahrenheit range ) you get " hi " or " lo " . if this happens , don't panic- chances you didn't insert thermometer correctly or filter isn't clean . replace filter if necessary try again . one many nice things this device it comes complete batteries . this may not seem like big deal but it no fun when you buy new electronic device , race home , discover you forgot batteries . braun knows when people buy thermometer , it usually because they need use it immediately . they don't want unexpected surprise no batteries . braun includes these your convenience . fact batteries ordinary aa also convenient because this type battery easy find . yet plus this thermometer it stores last temperature memory . this temperature display when you turn unit , allowing you see last reading compare it reading you take . this nice because it takes guesswork out task . often , pediatrician ask if you know previous temperature so he/she make comparisons check progress case illness . this device , it right there , panel when you turn it . when you take new temperature , reading remains screen sixty seconds your convenience . could this thermometer improved any way ? well , i only think few minor things . one would gripping surface- perhaps small section around middle rubber covering help consumers hold device more firmly place . possible improvement would lighted display panel , just case you need use thermometer dark place . these other changes could make thermometer even more appealing , but they minor shouldn't count much buying decision . keep things sanitary possible , it important always replace lens filter before each use . this small plastic cap fits over tip measuring device it needs replaced after each use . these replacement filters purchased most drug stores on- line cost less then ten dollars pack forty . this added cost owning this type thermometer . but any type thermometer going include its share cleaning/sanitation costs so , again , this shouldn't too much affect one decision buy . overall , this thermometer proven itself godsend me my family . ease use , memory storage last temperature reading , long battery life ( two years or 1000 measurements ) make this must anyone babies or toddlers . it eliminates much fussiness frustration common other thermometers even though it carries hefty price tag , it worth extra cost .	1
i love this thing !! i made fresh salsa everyday . i no trouble chopping onions . you need slice onion using slices 1/4 " 1/3 " thick . carrots need sliced half . it great dicing onions cooking . even celery diced . i would recommend highly !	1
i only used it once it broke ( made out cheap plastic) ! it sure " one time use only " way it shown tv not way you really use it , not so smoothly - i think they used already chopped onion . i would say it better soft vegetables such tomatoes ( which also very messy because juice ) . it just waste money . i wouldn't recommend it anyone .	-1

overall i would say this straighterner very good product . i straightening my hair almost 10 years , this far best straightener i used . plates smooth glassy ( ceramic all ) they heat up evenly great job . also because they so smooth not get hot spots scorched or burnt , any residue styling product so easily cleanable ( i used major problems cleaning gunk off my metal plated straighteners ) . i used numerous other straighteners snagged ( spaces plates ) , broke damaged my hair , since using this my hair looks so much healthier i fewer split ends less heat damage . my only regret when i bought this i not realize it came 2 inch size , which i most certainly would purchased instead since 1 inch size so small takes longer use ( reason missing star ) . i highly recommend this product even more than some straighteners i bought beauty supply stores .	1
my wife uses it every day ! compact easy storage travel . easy use . heats up quickly . rollers hold hair well . right number rollers each size .	1
my son broad shoulders hip muscular legs -- like both his father me -- so we go one size larger than his weight no matter what diaper we . these stay him ! which amazing because he very active ! it would nice if sides more flexable . he two already doing handstands . sometimes they split when he lifts his legs up	1

i usually not take time review items , but i make exception theracane . this one best things i bought myself it affectionately dubbed " boyfriend " due amount timne i spend it . getting your mind out gutter , i could barely move when i purchased this . i prior experience similar device years ago . one my friends given our nfl team i loved it wanted one , but never gotten around getting it . enter high stress job where i travel every weekend . sitting plane hours time sleeping different 4 different beds 12 nights month started wreaking havoc my body . not mention , i'm fairly intense begin . i love this thing because i get there use much pressure i am comfortable . i like hard pressure most massage therapists can't get muscle like i theracane . after week 3 times day theracane use trigger point therapy book , i felt like new person . my back shoulders relaxed , i found places my legs arms very painful some work , i now move more freely . cane very sturdy , i'm sure one could break it , but it would take some effort . i knocked myself upside head it while trying out different ways using it , it bit awkward . however , there little booklet comes it gives you ideas also there dvd you buy , but i no idea what . i use it working computer , watching tv , after gym , road ( it fit 25 " rolling suitcase diagonal angle . ) my real boyfriend uses it he not like strong pressure use little he likes , my work partner also purchased after my rave reviews it i most likely it me when i visit family get them hooked it too	1

photograph this product very misleading ! i thought i would receive 4 soaps shown photo , but i only got one i didn't even get choose which dinosaur i wanted inside . soap itself very sticky feels homemade . homemade isn't necessarily bad thing except here i'm not sure whether i trust ingredients , especially since soap really not very pleasant smelling .	1
don't tend write reviews ever , but let world know this one try prevent other people buying this product . bought it when it just came market few months ago lot more money than other epilators comparison . i've used braun many years but thought i'd invest into new one hoping new technologies would less painfull more efficien t.t his epilator definitely less painfull , but unfortunately more reason not pulling out any hair than any other reason . tried it several ways , dry , wet , shaving cream , soap , long hair , shortened hair ..... managed get maybe 50% hair out after going over it hundred times . consequently i've use it every day get all hair out over time , still hoping i'd get used it . but here i am , finally giving up , looking new epilator most likely go back braun . what big disappointment ! don't fall fancy bits	-1

great blow dryer . nice quiet , blow drys my hair quickly . definitely reduces frizz over regular blow dryer . only reason i can't give it 5 stars because it claims 4 different heat settings , 3 different air speeds .... what it doesn't mention low , med hi fan settings heat settings can't set independently each other . so hi fan also gives you hi heat ! digital display cute ... but useless .	1

i love this sunscreen ! i got some my dermatologist , i looking high spf sunscreen especially my face . i noticed there blue lizard face lotion well , but i just used regular . i love it ! i no problems far breakouts . it takes little bit rub because its high spf ( it lotiony , just really opaque ) but it worth it , because job like no other sunscreen i've tried . since effects last longer than average sunscreen , so you use less . plus bottle turns bright blue when sun rays dangerous , which i find pretty cool . i really feel protected this sunscreen beach . i like its light scent . price reasonable too	1
it works ! it so important buy it recycled - saves those trees	1
my own experience nizoral first time you use it ( after not using it while or not using it ever before ) , you get increase flakes . it almost if it loosening up ridding your scalp everything already there . after , continued use , it amazing . i find only after using it two or three times , i stop ... sometimes weeks , sometimes months , without reacurring dandruff ! so don't scared after first shampoo all these huge flakes show up . i wish it smelled little nicer , but it small price pay results !	1
excellent works like breeze . first anti dandruff shampoo actually worked me	1
this hair dryer works wonderfully . i only gave it 4 stars because comb attachment falling off bit . not big problem , except it hot ! course , perhaps it falling off because user error	1

concept cute , although size makes it bit difficult store when you not wearing them , but main problem they give you hat hair , compressing your hairstyle band surrounds your head . regular glasses go hairs , so everything fluffs out . if you never take off your reading glasses , buzz cut , bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head ( but careful buns ) , clic connect reader may fine you . otherwise , conventional glasses better bet	1
i purchased these after seeing physician friend mine using them . i absolutely recommend these any active person who needs reading glasses ready . i clip them morning use them off throughout day never misplace them . i purchased these gifts other professional people . one pair i purchased bit narrow temples . i heated back band hair dryer gave them little side side pull , placed them they fit just fine . if you particularly large person this may necessary	1
these glasses great idea . however , they not work long hair . back " strap " glasses ride high up back head lenses rest low nose ( so you see over them distance ) . long hair lays back glasses pushes them down back , making front glasses pop up placing lenses right front eyes . i guess most people who need reading glasses don't long hair	1
[ hey , my first amazon review ! ]i bought this shaver some weeks ago . this first time i've tried wet dry type shaver , i gotta tell ya , i love it !! my previous one braun ( i prefer single head shavers ) normal dry shaver , if i wanted really close shave it left my skin little sore extra friction . but washing little soap water just before using this shaver , i get beard that soften up little washing , then this shaver glides over soapy lather like silk !! my shave close every time , my face * very * happy i found this shaver . there bonus me . it faint buzz you hear over normal hum when it actually cutting off hairs , so i tell when i'm shaved clean just sound shaver . works great cleaning up those few die hard hairs my balding pate where i can't see - no buzz = no stubble . i just came back buy one these ( leave my travel kit - i keep it fully equipped so i just grab it go ) . i read review again mach 3 guy i just put my 2 cents , since i disagree him so strongly . fwiw , i notice he doesn't mention this shaver explictly , just touts mach 3 . hmm , i wonder if he really tried this shaver	1

i lighted makeup mirror years can't imagine not one , so when one lights started go out i began my search . i came across this mirror started reading reviews . i concerned because price soooo good i thought it too good true . i almost not buy it when i read lights difficult or times not turn but i threw caution wind there seemed far more positives , i'm glad i ! i say when i first set it up i could not get lights come felt sick feeling but i held button down second or two then released it tapped it again we lights ! wonderful bright lights they ( kind scary ) i guess i really needed this mirror while ago ;-) . i love stand different positions but i really like mirror swivels vertically instead horizontally thus letting me adjust it even more . 5x magnification clear really great doing my eyebrows . far side mirrors , i haven't really used those yet ( my other not them ) that not say time i won't . i'm just not used them . my only concern i don't problem lights month now , so i'm keeping my fingers crossed . i absolutely love everything this mirror i would buy it again i think it worth giving it try	1

many new bath/shower products come pretty interesting ( specious ) ingredients ( like mango-guava essence tea-bark oil , make up few ) . according labelling , these things some pretty miraculous things : tighten , illuminate , add bounce , lift separate ! ahem . anyway , my point this particular gel claims contain " electrolytes " " invigorate " " awaken " skin . i skeptical first , but pleased find , fact , it stimulating scrub . eye-opening effects might more gel clean , non-cloying limeade scent than any mystical ingredients , but whatever case , it works	1
use this when you want come back life gel smells good too gel awaking invigorating electrolytes work well	1
everyone my family owned these clic goggles . my original pair gave out after three years use . i ordered these because they said " standard size " they normally come small medium large . well , i am medium standard size large ( same my husbands ) . i tape them back make them smaller so i could wear them . not time return .... very disappointed . consider this before ordering you again .	1

sometimes i get terrible " jumpy legs " after i go bed night , making it hard fall asleep . i saw this thought it worth try , it really works . within 30 minutes after taking it , my leg cramps disappear . i've found out several my sisters friends suffer " jumpy legs " too , they found relief hylands leg cramps . quinine very mild muscle relaxer - i don't feel drugged or light-headed , just relieved . these tablets taste kind sweet they dissolve really quickly under your tongue . it couldn't easier get relief ! i've also found it helps lower back pain .	1
this humidifier works great .

i don't get it . some people spend tens , hundreds dollars take care their cars , ipods digital cameras . then , go out buy pair nail clippers - cheapest ones - $ . 99 gas station . should it not other way around , i mean , it your body . last week i picked up pair these $7 my local walgreens . so far , no problems . i love them , they so sharp you make yourself bleed if you're not careful . used ' gas station shears ' i no problem doing just so . after buying subsequently throwing away countless pairs nail clippers , i decided look something absolutely not rust ! i like keep pair clippers shower , my sink , porcelain covered metal frame , would develop brown rust spots after 1-2 days clipper left there . that when tweezerman set caught my eye , not because they made asia like all others , but because they 1 ) advertised stainless steel 2 ) guaranteed life . event i damaged them , it says here packaging they replace them 1/2 price me . ( sh not included ) . $7 new , i'm not sure if this means much , but least it says they stand product . but all it worth , price ( remember they whopping 7-10 times more expensive than regular ones ) worth paying my opinion	1

i this scale now 3 years . we use it linoleum our bathroom . first , i pretty happy it , thinking it decent scale money it seemed accurate . that until i went yearly check up . this scale weighs me my husband average 5-8 lbs . heavier than doctor scale , there no way zero-balance it . additionally , first battery it came lasted long time , only recently we see " lo " reading . we purchased package batteries recommended manufacturer this scale . 3 weeks ago , consistently , each week , i replace batteries because " lo " message appears all time ; accuracy this scale gone downhill tremendously . i know this because i weightloss regime lost 30 lbs . last 8 lbs , this scale refused show ; it just refuses move this incredibly frustrating when you're trying lose weight . second rectification occured when my husband i recently updated our life insurance ; this meant checkup doctor ( , subsequently , different scale ) . 2nd check up also revealed 5-8 lbs . weight difference than this scale shows . maybe 3 years too long expect $30 scale ; could definitely problem . regardless , i'm here amazon shopping new scale , i won't buying this one again .	1
after using my parent health o meter digital scale , this model closest similarity i could find . accuracy seems good ( cat weighed 11.8 lbs ., which right , though you could try holding test weight ) , which useful keeping airline freight under fifty pound mark . this model wider platform , so it very stable . battery compartment readily accessible , should lithium battery ever require replacement , which remedies complaint i noted reviews other models . i am quite pleased this purchase .	1

i use this trimmer without guides bring my beard down use razor . i've tried other brands only return them becuase they simply wont get close . precision good . keep your receipt , however , my blades dulled under year using it every two weeks . i however replace guide protect blades when not use . removal guides difficult but became simpler more use . i've read complaints them too cheap , but if they sturdier ( thicker ) they would not work well . it just takes little patience first few uses . i interested this trimmer because it blades you replace instead purchasing new trimmer when it becomes dull . when it came time replace them however cost averaged around $18 ( s/h ) new blades . target ( aug 20 , 2006 ) this exact razor ( complete set ) $17.99 store . tax usually less than s/h , so cautious prices you find !	1

these glasses always attract attention ( mostly when i'm not wearing them ! ) people always amazed when they see me click my readers into place . lenses hang molded lucite-type back strap ( this part inflexible ) , they pivot so they point downward when not worn . put them , just pivot lenses 90 degree angle , lift them your eyes , voila , strong magnet center joins two lenses nose bridge . side pieces adjust retractable extension encased lucite . i've lost so many pairs readers , but these always right there around your neck , not getting left behind coffeeshop counter ! they not all compact , however , because mentioned before , backstrap molded piece . neck/back strap also makes them little hard wear while reading bed , so i put them after getting settled , seems work just fine . finally , even though they not most fashion-forward version eyewear , their convenience fun clicking them into place makes up their clunky looks .	1

i admit when i got it realized basic idea this machine it fan ... i bit put out . but honestly , i used it last night i got best sleep i years . we usually keep fan our ac going or run actual fan which dries your sinuses out makes you cold . this little machine doesn't sound blocks out lot outside noise . i don't think i going anywhere without it anytime soon . i am thrilled so glad i spent money it . good sleep well worth it	1
i am disbelief this thing ever got marketed . first time i attached flexible hose it would not hold up weight shower head . i tried tightening it , twisting it , you name it no good . it hangs down 30 -60 degree angle best . i thought perhaps water flowing through it things might improve . nope . just got worse . engineering team this one should fired . this product should get bonehead design year award . how heck something like this ever got produced really blows my mind . waterpik -it coming back you .	-1
first seems little pricey , but well worth it , much better than any regular pillow , if you fill it right you don't hear any water noises all , very comfortable	1
let honest , we all wear cologne because either it attracts ladies or because we want cover up our stink . this cologne great both . it strong enough last all night but not too strong where people rolling down windows car let you know they gagging . it light fruity smell bit deeper musk . appropriate business casual but more geared toward blue jeans tshirt kind rugged man . i dress more preppy , but this suits me just fine . oh , bottle lasts forever	1

i live california very fair skin ( blond hair , blue eyes ) . most sunblocks i tried not worked promised , even those recommended my dermatologist ( i've tried md forte , solaray , solbar , many others - cheap stuff expensive brands ) . i found past even when i apply 30-60 sfp sunscreens during day , i still get some color my cheeks - issue year-round sunny climates even when you going your day , driving shopping so forth , you exposed damaging sun . addition , i indulgence -- i love bicycle beach during daytime occasion . nothing worked until i tried fallene . it not miracle product ... i'm sure if i sun 8 solid hours applied this product every 2 hours , i would still get tiny amount color . however , waterproof fallene product works like charm 2-hour bicycle rides - seriously , i get no color , regular spf 68 product works beautifully all-day year-round protection . it first time i ever satisfied sunscreen . i like it thick , because little goes long way . i also prone break out , i no problems this product . very high quality . if you're fair-skinned , this only thing work . sure shop around internet , you get good discounts it .	1
i bought yellowbird my salon three years ago lot more money . recently heating element went bad it blew only cold air . while i very disappointed it lasted relatively short time , i decided buy one just like it b/c when i tried others ( even conair ) they seemed wimpy . this price less than 1/3 what i originally paid it . so i don't care too much if it goes three years . i've never better hairdryer	1
ive this fragrance several times before . i love it , everyone comes contact me seems love it well ( especially ladies ) . only downside it doesn't seem last more than few hours .	1
guru lite only " low calorie " energy drink i've found doesn't use artificial sweeteners like sucralose or aspartame . taste not sweet like soft drink or some other sugar laden energy drinks so it might not everyone , but i think it tastes good . i recommend you drink it cold .	1

i used whal " face shaper " 20 years . when i dropped it hard surface cast cutting blades cracked . andis 29775 headline my replacement due price especially because it claimed help grown hairs part new routine . brushing your face provided brush help ( though i doing years ) . problem andis 29775 it gets very hot even after it broken . i using it 3 months it still gets just hot when i used it first time . if you ingrown hairs , or ever dermatologist related issues , you know heat causes irritation . my mom cut hair sold make up over 30 years . she always said same thing . actually , she bought me whal face shaper swears them . needless say , i buy whal . they " never get hot " , no matter how long you run them , they cut exactly good andis . not mention if i hadn't dropped mine , it would still working perfectly after over 20 years . also , you don't need andis ' so called revolutionary face brush either . any fine beard brush " soft " brissels exact same thing . i facial skin problems all my life i am now almost 42 . so my statements come plenty exerience . i highly recommend anyone these types problems whal trimmer over andis . best regards , terry	1
i love this thing . it what it supposed , which remove hair . i don't understand people complaining it hurts , course it hurts , you're pulling hair out root . i used veet pre wax spray help some . i also suggest disinfecting device heads alcohol before use so you don't spread bacteria into hair follicle wind up pimples . i get small dots where i used this since those small red dots inflamed hair folices but they went away over night . i used this every where , face , legs , zone loved it . i haven't thrown out my razor because i shave my legs right after i use emjoy so my legs completely baby smooth . it gets my face , zone , arms baby smooth i never shaved those places . smoothness last 2 weeks then i use emjoy again since new hairs sprout up . time goes i find myself using razor less less my legs it takes few months get every hair plucked . if you epilate get all hairs root it eventually stops growing , i've waxed my underarms years prior emjoy very little hair there . great thing you emjoy whenever you want , no more waiting hair grow like waxing . all all great product small enough take you but don't let size fool you , it gets job	1
so i don't know how many guys use this but i am one . i think this painful way remove hair , but let remember you removing many hairs root ! i tried nair , waxing . so i say i know what pain . but least this pain you should get weeks smooth skin . i only just used it so i don't know how long i get or how many ingrown hairs i get . i used this my back arms just tried little my face . they say not use your face , why i don't know other than pain . i bleed few spots would break out into cold sweats while using this . anyone used any electric shaver should know they always say your skin just needs time get use it . so i am hoping thinking this case this . even what i said above i would recommend this product because it it job , i am so thankful able found this product . i think long run it worth it . because it lot cheaper than anything else . even if it breaks i buy one every year . since i spending around $50 month when i paying nair , growth inhibitor shipping . which 50 12 = 600 yr . also when it comes time it may take awhile area(s ) you chose but long run it really no time all . remember you should get least couple days or up 6 weeks smooth . my back i used nair since i not this product yet . then waited week skin heal . this helped me not long or many hairs pull . they recommend trimming hairs if it awhile since your last session . but since i couldn't reach i use nair . i am looking into extending claw hold emjoi ap-96 optimini epillator future . good luck	1

my wife got one these typically decided try it out giving me pedicure . i since learned dread sound whinning motor even more than dentist drill . unless you keep it continous motion perfect angle , rapid rotation causes friction which burns your nail ( or skin ) causes intense , sharp pain . you might well run your tool box put electric drill or dremmel sanding disk your hands feet . not throw away your money this thing unless you plan use it filing plastic or anything not atttached human .	-1

i seeing same stylist ten years . i adore her i trust her implicitly . when i asked her hair straighteners , she showed me one she uses professionally , used it style my hair . it little more expensive than offerings target or wal-mart , but she said , " you right tools . " not only she use hai stick work , but her daughters use it well . hai stick multiple settings different hair types . my hair fine but curly somewhat intractable . lowest setting not sufficient , but i found setting halfway up dial ( 260 ) works very well . because way you customize settings , this straightener suitable all hair types . it heats up ten seconds . note : all heat styling , my stylist recommended using thermal protectant . i bought tresemme thermal creations straightening gel . it works very well only costs $8 . overall , this very effective , high quality product	1
i don't even know where start , this iron absolutely amazing . i really thick , curly hair , i always wear it curly , or up ponytail , because if i tried straighten it blowdrier , no matter what kind brush i used , or what kind products i used , it would end up big poufy mess . well let me tell you , this iron exceded all my expectations , then some . i one other straightener before this one , it total letdown . but this one straightens my hair one pass , medium heat . it heats up no time , i'm very impressed it on/off switch breaker-thing if it overheats . my hair stays straight smooth through almost anything . even high humidity , you would never able tell my hair wasn't naturally straight . i've owned it 9 months , i don't think i could live without it	1
after two weeks very cool performance this thing went nuts ! it used change colors ever 15 or so seconds . now it changes colors every 2 seconds . looks like strope light . it drive you nuts ! plus , it completly soaks anything around it . you need change " towels " under it twice day ! ruin anything it sitting ( moisture damage ) . great idea but poor product . not worth 51 bucks ! amazon says they give money back . after buying hundreds amazon goodies this first thing i've got pretty much junk . not !!! just read other reviews . hope this helps	-1

i previously leg waxing salon , i really liked results , however , i didn't return because i rash reaction some product they used . i figured if i more control over products , i would better results . i bought this product starter kit , which included 4- 2 ounce bottles : ) after wax skin concealer , ) pre-hon epilation cleanser , ) slow grow reduce hair re-growth ) wax off . i read instructions , but i confused what wax . i supposed put water heating compartment then put wax container into water , or just put container there no water or should i dump contents wax container into compartment . nowhere instructions it tell me how it . i tried all three eventually dumped wax . even if this not correct , i used two occasions didn't feel it easy . wax either too thick or too thin drips or hard spread , simply impossible backs your legs yourself . wax off doesn't work easily i residual wax everywhere . after wax skin concealer just like makeup your legs i found it useless . pre hon cleanser says use it then apply powder ( which doesn't come kit ) . i didn't even try slow grow because i don't think you slow hair growth . maybe it better pay money get it professionally .	1

these glasses always attract attention ( mostly when i'm not wearing them ! ) people always amazed when they see me click my readers into place . lenses hang molded lucite-type back strap ( this part inflexible ) , they pivot so they point downward when not worn . put them , just pivot lenses 90 degree angle , lift them your eyes , voila , strong magnet center joins two lenses nose bridge . side pieces adjust retractable extension encased lucite . i've lost so many pairs readers , but these always right there around your neck , not getting left behind coffeeshop counter ! they not all compact , however , because mentioned before , backstrap molded piece . neck/back strap also makes them little hard wear while reading bed , so i put them after getting settled , seems work just fine . finally , even though they not most fashion-forward version eyewear , their convenience fun clicking them into place makes up their clunky looks .	1

chocoleans work suppress actual hunger ; however , they nothing " i feel like eating " feeling . i use them suppress hunger , then when i still feel like eating , i know it not real hunger but my usual food fixations . it helps me psychologically anyway , interpret my feeding feelings ! also , they work best if you not eat one hour before after taking . ( drinks don't count , doesn't seem affect anything . ) i love taste , can't tell much difference sugar-free regular ones ... sugar-free only 6 calories less . it very dark chocolate , so if you don't like dark you probably won't care	1

( yes , before you ask , i always use pre-electric shave lotion prior shaving ) . first morning i used this remington r-960 , i felt nothing out ordinary . felt pretty much like any other electric razor . 15 20 minutes after i finished shaving i began notice burning-type feeling around my neck/throat area . hour later i really felt this burning sensation . i leave work when i quick ' mirror check ' bathroom holy cow !! my neck throat area bright red all swollen ! i mean bright red swollen ! no wonder burning sensation i feeling . i looked like i just finished ( trying ) shave gas powered hedge trimmer ! i got work guys i work like " holy crap !! what happened you ? " " why , i just shaved my brand new remington r-960 this morning . why you ask " , i sarcastically replied . they said it looked like someone took chain saw my throat ! you get idea . bottom line ... it took approximately 6 days all redness swelling entirely clear up my neck/throat area . needless say , morning which first time i used my new remington r-960 electric also last time i used it . i haven't touched it since . frankly if i may honest here , i'm little frightened thing now . it like it mind it own it bit me but good . now , each morning when i'm shaving my remington ms2-300 micro screen ( not triple head ) razor , i sort tendency keep one eye little monster it still sitting there shelf near sink mirror , patiently waiting next time i'm foolish enough pick it up again . you warned	1
odd fat boomerang shape , hard get access cutters , hard clean , on-off switch almost flush razor very hard turn off . shave marginal . i much prefer tne remington ta4570	1
i hesitated buying this more " basic " version when there many others more options choices . we very happy it now it here . there quieter tone stronger tone , both very soothing gentle , but perfect aiding sleep . i still hear children clearly room when they speak , too .	1
first glance , sound machine looks very outdated old , but it really great job masking noise . our son gotten used sleeping humidifier , but i tired filling it , so thought i'd try this instead it awesome ! they could work updating look , though	1
this scale lot different functions . they all help keep your weight under control . i would buy this again	1
overall i love scale . it keeps track four different people weight , let you know how much you've lost or gained daily . biggest problem i it you can't read numbers unless it light . it should light up so you see it 5:00 a.m. when it dark !!	1
this scale highly accurate . some people complain you get different reading everytime . reasons : 1 . they not balanced correctly scale . scale displays arrows so you know which way correct your balance . those people saying they get different result during day , average person ways 2-5 lbs heavier night . why ? because , you eat drink during day . you actually weigh lighter night if you just good cardio work out due all water loss . i highly recommend this product . it gives me accurate results so i gauge my progress . remember though , measurements better gauge result	1
this kit very much worth price . it easy my face feels so soft smooth , i can't keep my hands off my face afterwards	1
i'd far prefer use generic forms ibuprofen but hives extra ingredients used fillers . someone recommended liqui-gel form hives disappeared . i used generic ibuprofen years alleviate joint pain . hives one possible side-effects ibupofen . if you experience anything unusual while using drug , check out possible side effects related it . tinitus also possible side effect ibuprofen aspirin	1

whether you microwave this blanket or not , you certainly won't disappointed . fabric unbelievably soft , weight flax seed lavender feels incredibly cozy . when warmed , it best heating pad you could ask , evenly heating soothing your sore muscles . i love it so much i'm tempted buy two sew them together make one big blanket . trust me , this item worth every penny	1
this good monitor . my only negative remark would unit pumps little too much pressure . really gets tight your arm . but ... main thing desired accuracy this unit it accurate .	1
my dad two monitors . this one more acurate consistent . this most important thing blood pressure monitor . only problem it not portable . but it good idea one your office one home such cheap price	1
i bought this hair dryer because good price i am more than happy it . i could not say if " ions " anything , but dryer what i wanted it - dry my hair reasonable amount time , it takes no quicker or longer length time than any other hair dryer . cool shot button dream , it blasts cold hair immediately finish my hair . reasonable weight size . i use this dryer every morning only reset over-heat button once , it reset straight away dryer started working immediately again . i believe price amazon this good value hair dryer buy	1

this shaver saver cleaner/ lubrication great product last while . it works best water proof/ resistant shaver . you dont need buy self-cleaning shaver if you get water proof one use shaver saver	1
glasses well made but i found them awkward use . they didn't fit comfortably it took quite bit time get them . gimmick sounded cool but didn't work well me . every head different , so maybe they'll work better you	1
i use these glasses all time work . they sure handy . glad i bought them	1
i really excited when i saw these reading glasses split nose bar , how nifty , just wear them looped over back your neck click lens part together whenever you read fine print . great idea , but execution idea not everyone . back piece also hard plastic , rigid , if you long hair , you lift them out under your hair place plastic back strip your mid-skull level , fit them your ears then fit front parts together snap . back you end up looking like you wearing external orthodontic apparatus . i'd like see company put string place hard plastic loops around your neck . magnetic clip brings two lenses together front fabulous idea , two lenses hanging off sides instead whole pair glasses swaying across your front so much more comfortable out way - it just rigid frame back makes me wonder if anyone really tried using these things before they mass manufactured	1
title says it all . easy read , not disappointed any way !!! p.s. i am not affiliated this product any way ..	1
these goggles great ! they not bulky like other goggles they lot more stylish . i got lot compliments while skiing . price great too ! almost half what my local ski store sells them . without hat , smaller size fit me snugly but when i tried them hat ( since i would wearing them ski ) , i found i needed bigger size keep them popping off .	1
i just bought vespa scooter short trips since gas prices so high . i needed some eye protection would work my helmet . these goggles awesome ! they fit perfectly inside my helmet , because wrap around my head , they stay put . magnets front very strong so goggles don't move . eye cups just right size they're padded comfort . these goggles far exceeded my expectations .	1
i ride motorcycles bicycles -- these goggles fit me great keep my eyes safe . i dry-eye , so i'm really sensitive wind goggles work like charm . they're easy take off keep around your neck no hassle it easy keep up them way . my wife loves them rollerblading . she looks fierce them , that part deal these -- they look so cool . smaller size fit her -- she couldn't wear standard size . now , what else needed ? somone else said , clear lenses nighttime would grea t--t hen one could use them saftey goggles well . interchangeable lenses would best . also , someone else mentions , they're not easy store -- they fold over puts lenses against each other . tube would make more sense than sack -- they lend themselves tube because their unique design . course , polarized much better than tinted my opinion , it worth price difference . so these great , but they could even better . i hope clic listening -- these goggles could next great thing sports eyewear	1
i tried many types brands vitamins . source life far best . i tell when i miss taking them . if i take them empty stomach , i never even gotten slightly nauseated , unlike other vitamins i've taken . these high quality , good you really raise your energy level . i highly recommed sol vitamins .	1

i found this suggestion elsewhere internet , tried it , it works great ! " i've used zelco booklights years , discovered early their bulbs burn out quickly -- no doubt nice profit source company since replacement bulbs cost dime each when bought bulk . problem four 1.5 volt batteries ( or ac adapter ) produce 6 volts , while called 6 volt bulbs , these things actually work optimally 5 volts . solution hit radio shack or similar vendor buy 7.5 volt replacement bulbs ( $1.59 2 pack ) . you get very slightly less light , but single bulb now lasted me almost 3 years nightly use , because filament bulb burning lower temperature .	1
pricey , shipped quick but well worth dough . it worked me my face jacked up plus i bumps my neck which wasnt cool . i cant say enough this stuff its good stuff	1
excellent addition my skin care regiment . this product makes my skin feel soft silky smooth . i've also converted my mother sister	1

i hesitant buying personal razor because i heard horror stories shavers past ( anyone say epilady ? ) but i tired regular razors so really ready give this new style try . ( regular razors either couldn't get close enough due safety blade , or they nicked me even when i careful . ) course , it little hard fork over money this , me , it just shaver . i could not more wrong . this shaver set awesome . cleancut shaver works wonderfully , gives great ( smooth ) result , there no chance getting cut or nicked . * only * reason i give it four stars ( i really would like give it 4.5 ) because : ) while cleancut t-handle trimmer works okay what it ( trim hair short enough shaver ) , it doesn't work great -- more private areas , i concerned i might get nicked ( although , honest , i didn't ) . ) i would like just bit larger shaving area cleancut shaver . just hair over inch wide ( maybe 1-1/8 " ) it took quite bit time cover all necessary areas . while size surely designed nooks crannies , i still think little larger surface area would worked just well also cut down shaving time . said , this product well worth money , i highly recommend it anyone . it great able get such close shave without messy shave creams , gels , or lotions ... or painful waxing	1
i used original old spice scent years wanted change . i picked up pure sport love it .... great scent lasts all day isn't over-powering . recommended	1

never worn night guard before , i very happy i ordered low profile one . i small mouth adjustable sides enabled me fit it just right . tiny strip fits across lower bottom teeth holds it right place when positioned according directions . i afraid it would keep me awake night , but once i figured out correct settings placement , it like wearing contacts ; you don't really notice it if you don't think it . it seem work better me if i lie my back not my side . one thing i didn't understand when i ordered it , this product not made bite down , but separate your teeth so it re-trains your muscles hold your jaw correct positon while you're sleeping so you don't feel need clench all . surprisingly , i only wear it once or twice month . i clenching my teeth ever since i my braces removed teenager . over years my subconcious clenching caused stress cracks my molars migraine headaches . wish i gotten this 25 years ago	1

i don't know those who say " only four uses " ... i use one blade two weeks ( 14 uses ) ... anyway , i like smoothness cut this blade . it really nice . my only complaint blade so fat ( wide ) it hard get those tricky places , like your moustache under your nose . great product , i agree , once you " gillette man " you always gillette man . :)	1
once you're stuck gillette , you're stuck life !!!! ok so yah this new blade system they got going nice . it nice shave . first use or 2 , it doesn't feel like shaving cause it smooth . but really that it . you only get maybe 4 shaves out each blade before you switch . unless you like looking like bloody mess . expensive - gillette death grip all american men . cause stuff works good but they charge you mint just get goods . i like it , i'm user , but arg there no way these worth so much money .	1

i started using this product three months ago wow what difference ! i suffered teenage acne which never really went away when i hit my thirties it came back vengeance . i'm 36 now developed very sensitive skin . never makeup person since it makes me break out . i even tried prescription acne medication , which never worked . finally took six month treatment pills it cleared my skin up but it never same . i don't sun worship not since case sun poisoning when i 24 . i also fair complexion which reddens within five minutes outside . i wear hat while gardening due sensitive nature my skin . freckles everywhere , even my arms . i've plagued dry , sensitive skin trust me over moisturizing doesn't work ! i began use aveeno biore products got my skin under control but i still breakouts . i've tried neutrogena past but wasn't satisfied cleansers stuff .. after reading other reviews this product neutrogena advanced solutions i decided try both them what result ! facial peel i use once week or so , because cost i stretching it using advanced solutions . first thing i noticed dry skin i trouble , which led combination skin dry patches my face improved within couple weeks . i developed this odd condition breaking out my jaw line scars even acne just wouldn't go away .. they're finally gone ! also breakouts i nearly stopped ! i still get breakouts , especially right before my period but soon it happens i use biore facial strips clean out my pores dab some aveeno facial mask , which also marvelous , i control breakouts . some might think i use too many products but reality i rotate them . like when i get zit i dab some aveeno facial mask ( not my entire face , just breakout area ) right before shower rinse it off end . gentle mask soy cleansing doesn't clog my pores . i can't afford facials facial peels so these good alternative . neutrogena facial peel must followed up good moisturizing lotion . i personally use aveeno clear complexion face lotion , this light doesn't clog my pores like some others . also its good idea scrub away flaking skin ( usually next day ) i use aveeno facial two side scrubs ( round jar ) . face soap doesn't dry my skin out scrubbing side perfect sloughing off dried skin . also try neutrogena advanced solutions - this more textured then facial scrub . white sandy thicker solution you dab onto your face use hand held " scrubber " comes kit . its not really scrubber it doesn't rotate , it vibrates . anyway i use this every other day or so , again sparingly . i don't glop stuff my face just few dots , forehead , cheeks , chin jaw anyplace where i might blackheads then follow up face cream . also this doesn't `foam ' up like it looks commercial , it more exfoliating scrub then cleanser . facial peel thinner sort tan gray color , looks sort gross when applying i apply it sparingly thin layer . you really don't need put it heavily . your face tingle , which normal , massage off fingertips or sometimes i use my handheld face sponge . one those free gifts order something or other . you also use sponge advanced solutions circular motions . your face pink up within thirty minutes after using this so don't panic . this normal because it increases circulation your skin which brings blood your cheeks . remember use facial cream while your face still moist . sometimes i forget then my face feels all dry . i usually use these scrubs after i've taken shower my face moist pores open . also use hairband or hair towel keep hair back , its really annoying trying wash face scrub out your hair . follow up toner lotion you should notice difference within couple weeks . other reviews this product point out you continue use these products its true ! but suffered acne all my life frustrated lack good over counter products price worth purchasing these using them . there ways stretching products out like i said above . also great products .. no i don't work aveeno , they just really great products don't cost fortune ! aveenoclear complexion cleansing mask clear complexion daily cleansing pads ( this one scrubbing side smooth side)clear complexion daily moisturizer clear complexion foaming cleanser - absolutely great daily use or even more then once daily . hot weather i use it more often when i feel like cool rinse . correcting treatment , clear complexion if you're looking good moisturizer your body , try aveeno creamy moisturizing oil or moisturizing shower bath oil . i also use jergen ultra healing which you use your face also . bioreblemish ice cleanserdaily deep cleaning pore cleansing cloths - these sometimes better then using toner cotton ball since it full cloth . my husbands actually likes use these also . he also likes pore unclogging scrub when he takes shower triple action astringent . good luck your skin !	1
we used cloth diaper service daughter until she eighteen months . because heavy cloth diaper still wasn't thick enough her so we switched tushies . tushies our first choice disposable diaper because it contains cotton doesn't contain fragrance . i would not use any other conventional diapers because toxic chemicals such dioxin chlorine , fragrance gel . since we adults wear cotton underwears , why shouldn't our child wearing same thing ? one thing i would like see tushies offers more sizes . example , huggies carries six different diaper sizes . also , tushies diapers much more expensive than conventional diapers	1
contour backmax just what we needed post-surgery cushion support . it just pictured described	1

i used panasonic er411nc model great satisfaction past 4 years . er411nc models lasted year each moderate usage . i've very happy their ability deal medium-length hair . sure , there bit burning smell , but who cares when gadget what it supposed -- i.e. , cut hair . this time , i thought i'd try sleeker looking er416kc . big mistake ! blade so far inside it hardly cuts any hair longer than half inch . don't waste your money it , go tried tested er411nc model instead	-1

we used tushies first , then 7th generation ( they smell funky , when we put them baby , first i thought they smell like food , my husband tells me oh , they smell like she number 2 , but i tell him , that how they smell even if baby doesn't anything them , but when i guest they want hold baby i'm embarassed if they think she something diaper , when she doesn't . besides , they fine . we used nature boy girl , i love them , but boy , i think blue thing gel showing diaper . so we went back tushies , no gel , all cotton , natural you get i guess . only reason i give it 4 stars , they damn leak near leg openings , my baby just 3 weeks old , she doesn't pee much . i change both our clothes especially after messy diaper . i'll buy inserts , see if it improves .	1
i am so happy i decided get better hair dryer than pedestrian big box store offerings . air flow concentrated , so it takes significantly less time dry your hair . cord extra long nice . highly recommended	1
dryer meets all your styling needs . it not often you find one suited both curly straight styles . air diffusing attachment perfect creating soft , frizz free curls while concentrator nozzle ( more narrow therefore better conductor air than most models this feature ) allows you direct air exactly where you want it . dryer itself features two speed ( low high ) three heat settings ( cool , warm hot ) , well cold shot button lock style . highest heat setting , simply put dryer high speed hottest setting ( careful , though ... this only recommended hair that uber curly , like mine ) . additionally , 9 foot long cord ( complete loop allow you hook it onto something your bathroom or wherever else you store it ) makes it really easy use . bonus : even highest setting , dryer considerably more quiet than other ones market similarly priced ( you easily hold conversation while speaking normal tone voice ) . according information that included product , dryer made combination pink tourmaline/ceramic technology allows special emission ions ( these important eliminating static electricity ) . i found after use , my hair actually lot smoother even than when i used previous hair dryers ionic technology ; i used it style my hair both its naturally curly state after setting it rollers blow dry it straight . if your hair really curly like mine , however , you might still want use flatiron get pin-straight look . but less curly hair or hair that less prone frizz , probably won't necessary . although this far my favorite hair dryer i've ever owned , i agree previous comment this product : it really would perfect dryer if it folding handle . but this only tiny flaw , it more than makes up missing feature its humidity resisting technology . well , remington . invaluable product any styling arsenal	1
i just love this product it must if you bay or just any familky member . great grea	1
i love these 9-volt batteries because 7 year shelf life ! once you buy these you won't need any long time . no more running out store snow when your tv remote batteries die . jl price you can't go wrong ! these suckers heavy duty name you trust , not some generic brand dies after few hours . i've shopped around , there no better industrial strength 9-volt price . way make shopping easy again	1

this first time i ever used bikini trimmer . but i must say this good one i purchased . it came case , oil trimmer , brush clean , 5 settings hair length , this shaver rechargeable , which very nice . it trimmer not shaver so if your looking real close shave you better stick either shaving or just waxing . easy take apart clean . it not too loud , sounds like every other shaver . i'm very pleased my purchase would recommend it any girl ( or guy-i guess ) looking way some maintence area	1
this very well-designed well-made reading light . leds very bright provide nice white light , suitable reading or serve hands-free flashlight . lights rotated thru small axis up or down ( maybe 45 degrees ) so you aim it perfectly . since lights led batteries should last much longer than other bulbs . only problem i this light i originally only bought one my wife liked it so much i surrender it often . now i found it amazon , we'll enough kids , too	1

i just received my air purifier yesterday chance use it near my bed one night sleeping so far . i mild asthma i am heavily effected ozone ( it makes me react badly it ) so part reason i bought this brand it touted " no ozone " it ionizer it those produce ozone . however , you it turned off all times if you want . even it my reactions it mild , i spoke rep rabbit air who 24/7 phone support they told me it uses low power ionizer so its not smelly intense ozone generation . so those asthma ozone sensativity you turn off ionizer ! also those who wondering size it stands 20 inches off floor . pros : -the charcoal/pre filters washable sink or dishwasher-the hepa filter coated antiviral/antibacterial agent last longer- 1.5 year filter life continuous use . -5 year warranty-very clear high tech looking front display -body painted anti electro-static coating prevent dust build up-hepa filter gasket bottom edge perimeter prevent air leakage-the odor particle sensors front actually function accurately . i would thought it cheap gimmick but they actually work ! its nice extra feature you don't see elsewhere . ( when you buy one spray some air freshener or puff powder somewhere middle room watch odor/particle lights crank up shortly afterward)cons : ( small gripes , but not enough me effect 5 star rating , but if this 1 out 10 scoring system . i'd give it 9 or 9.5 )-i dont problem this but some people say front panel bright bedroom . if you like perfect blank room then find way cover display . no way shut off front display other then power off . -the unit requires remote control get all its higher functions . all you unit itself turn power on/off . remote uses over sized watch battery so it wont something you laying around house spare backup . -the ionizer turns itself every time you select new function remote ( speeds settings ) so , you need turn it back off everytime you change its settings ( not big deal)-some people surprised its size . but after getting it its mid thigh high . you press it up against wall if you want .. since its somewhat thin profile it takes up less floor space then thise giant square or round designs other air purifiers . i am not sure if its worth price yet . however , so far so good ! when you look price competition quality featurs you get this . its very nice comparable model put your shopping radar if you market	1
i just got this air purifier today , so i can't comment affectiveness , but i say so far i'm impressed it . it easy set up , many different settings , automatically monitor air quality so you set it forget it . it senses both particles air odors air separately which i though cool feature . it extremely quiet low i also love fact filters cleanable so they last longer . i say manual very confusing how often replace filters though , so i went rabbitair website able instant message representative . literally within seconds i my answer . hepa filter technically last up 3 years depending your use , but indicator light go after 18 months regardless . aside , if you don't replace filter every 18 months warranty void . carbon filter replaced every 3 6 years , again based how much use it gets . metal pre-filter never replaced . unit very light , although it lot bigger than i expected it . overall , this product seems like it going great my dust dander allergies	1
my dermatologist recommended this my sensitive , somewhat oily skin . it cleans without harsh	1
cetaphil make great line products . almost everyone use them , because there no fragrance , colour or anything else irritate your skin . this cleanser no exception . it actually got no real fragrance , but you smell natural smell all neutral ingrediants it . it feels nice going skin , but if you heavy make-up , it not best remover . you should probably use this either only morning before applying make-up , or if you use non-heavy make-up . i use this often - i love how my skin doesn't feel tight or dry after using it i lent it friend one time who very sensitive skin , she no problems . give it try . it makes cheap alternative expensive cleansers either same job or less superior job . this great	1

previous reviews overall pretty negative , so i am here offer different pov . i this product few months now , used four or five times , i haven't experienced any problems it . i always problems cheap electric clippers past , but price one barbershop haircut , you get least one service out it , so i bought it anyways . so far , i happy it person get . if it break down future , though , i won't really feel too bad it . note it bit bulky	1
free chlorine other junk , they work well don't smell like so many others . thumbs up	1

microflex r-845 provides me smooth rapid shave every day without any discomfort . i would recommend it over any blade shaving	1
i've using this 4 years , very satisfied . way better than my previous single-blade shaver . it sometimes annoying it runs only battery , not directly wallplug , but it doesn't happen often .. razor head easily detached cleaned , which i think true any norelco or remington products . but please bear mind this review based my personal experience : asian early 30s . average density asian , which i believe fairly light compared average american . rather thick strong hair , but doesn't grow fast . 2 ~ 3 shaves per week enough me ..	1
this lotion excellent under liquid make-up . it not only moisturizes skin but it sun block well .	1
my dermatologists recommended eucerin extra protective moisture lotion 3 years ago . it so highly recommended because it not clog pores protects skin very harmful uv rays . i recommend eucerin extra protective moisture lotion everyone	1

this excellent product , one which far superior other walkers baskets market . its non-institutional appearance real asset . padded basket cover foam-encircled back rail provide comfortable seat home or outside . it turns ease , while still offering real stability . it store easily backseat or trunk . weight may make it slightly unwieldy lift above waist high , there some assembly required .	1
this product could not remove all minor scratches my lens . top , brush left dust my lens which dried solution	1
i something similar this when i kid i used it consistently . construction quality this one seems higher than one i remember using 20 years ago . i would recommend this sedentary person who needs some activity , but not someone hoping get cardiovascular workout or bulk up . i my fingers toes amputated , so there aren't really lot options me . included instructions don't really give you wide range exercises this , so it effective you may invent some new ones some trial error . when it wears out ( it appears it may awhile ) , i buy one	1
don't believe all whiners here who left negative feedback . i owned exerciser like this some years ago nylon rope plastic pulleys . it great , quick workout home i lost thing move . i glad get similar item elastic bands only $10 . far using it , just bind doorhandle loop rubber band or tape . move away door , just add length nylon 3/8 inch rope . what heck you expect $10 !	1
this exerciser would useless you unless you extremely out shape . learn leg raises yourself , throw few pushups . someone hold your feet while you learn situps . don't waste your money	1
it actually scared me intially - because burning smell heat . but now after using it over year , i'd recommend this product but not keep high expectations . design good enough reach places :-)	1

course it individual thing , but my wife found bristles this brush too stiff harsh use her back . i bought brush her her request . i never use these things myself , so i cannot comment personally . palm my hand bristles seem soft enough . she needed replacement similar brush no longer made . just heads up others might find brush too stiff use . i gave brush 4 stars because otherwise it seems like good product . but harshness , course , deal breaker . she going buy brush store so she check bristles first hand -- probably good idea anyone	1
i hate traditional sunscreen tends oily heavy . i liked idea sheer light feel neutrogena . so i tried both neutrogena ultra sheer spf 30 45 . soon i applied product , i felt strong burning sensation throughout my entire face . not some tingly sensation associated some products . it felt like my face fire . i immediately washed it off . it still hurt . i cool it cold water numb pain . next day , my face pink throughout my skin still hurt . i tried variety products , cetaphil , purpose , alba , lancome , estee lauder , clarines , chanel , clinique , many over counter products typically found any drug store . i never such reaction . note , i don't sensative skin . my skin tends normal little shine zone . my mom , who dry skin , tried products . she also complained it hurt use either spf 30 or 45 . i throw them away . don't waste your money .	-1

hi , i usually dont like wasting time write reviews but since i so impressed this massager i write one . i just bought it today brookstone after seeing this website well let me tell you little it . their two speeds massager high low , massager spring like head it very soft , it very quiet discreet looking , it cordless so you dont bother cords getting your way when using it , all this makes it massager one best massagers i owed . $50 you cant go wrong i would paid up $100 this no joke	1
i bought this replace tempur-pedic pillow gotten " musty " after several years use . homedics foam material very slightly different . it not quite soft but it stays cooler itself , also thanks ventilation holes through pillow . this makes me actually prefer this over what i before , even without considering tremendous price difference . early indications this pillow last long time , there absolutely no sign any deterioration , even my significant movement during night	1

overall , this isn't bad sunscreen . it contains avobenzone , which recommended dermatologists its broad-spectrum protection . scent light not too objectionable . it little thicker than some sunscreens , which makes it more difficult spread , but it also ensures more complete coverage . one minor drawback it greasy sticky , most sunscreens . but worst problem migration into eyes ( coppertone products seem among worst this ) . since it advertised waterproof " non-stinging " specifically targeted use young children , you'd think it would safe use close eyes , but such not case . my young daughter small amount water splash her face , she instantly felt sunscreen stinging her eye . this hour after application , amount water hit her eye only few drops . debilitating discomfort persisted entire day couldn't relieved rinsing her eye saline . ( water babies isn't waterproof eyelids , but apparently it sticks pretty well eye itself ! )so bottom line this sunscreen acceptable use body , but avoid using it anywhere near eyes	1
daughter richard trezevant- after thanksgiving last year i began breaking out horrible acne some reason i dont know ; maybe it greesy food i eating or cetaphil i using wasnt strong enough my face . i finally decided enough enough i found this neutrogena . i used it before but i completely forgot how it exsisted . ive using it ever since it really helped ; now my face mostly just light scarring . my only concern though doesnt help me when im my period . i start breakout out really badly especially around my chin my lips .	1

users seem love or hate this product . i've using it faithfully many years . it greenish pasty this puts some people off . use large pea-size amount enough water foam your face ( eyelids o.k. too-it gentle ) , then let dry 15-20 min . rinse well cleanse remove any residue , your skin feel soft smooth . it spendy , but jar last long time . if aha exfoliators too harsh you , this may work . amazon price very good	1
when you very young ( i think back those days ) , your skin cells epidermis constantly state rejuvenation . skin renews itself approximately every 28 days . we all age , this process start take twice long . so , skin cells start build up top layer skin . this causes dehydrated , rough dull complexion . slower cell production , free radical damage breakdown collagen elastin encourages those little wrinkles start appear . you start use vitamin skin cream hope best , but really you still fighting all those dead skin cells which clog pores promote sebum build up ( cause breakouts blemishes ) . best skin care regimen also includes exfoliation , topically applied antioxidants sunscreen ! try vitamin cream avalon active organics coq10 facial cleansing cr�me . all zia products most impressive . i'm quite love all products i've tried so far . fresh papaya enzyme peel no exception . this smooth earthy almost scent-free green mask contains papain activated water . papain protein-digesting enzyme dissolves dead skin cells without disturbing live , healthy ones . it found unripened papaya fruit . it all natural , non-abrasive exfoliant . it removes dead surface skin your face give you more even texture . most traditional scrubs too harsh use granules strip top layer skin , healthy cells all . this result irritation over-production oil even scarring . you cleanse your skin then apply small amount your damp face . enzyme supposed stay active up 1 hour . first time you use this , you leave it 5-20 minutes . then you increase time 40 minutes , etc . before rinsing , you reapply some water massage gently , then rinse off warm water . it recommended use last three times week , but gentle enough use every day . you notice difference more vibrant look your skin after using this product few times . i've noticed dry weather mask tends dry bit my face , so keep spray bottle pure water handy keep mask moist . this not mask you want let dry . when you go spa , they always steamer your face during enzyme treatment phase , so you might also want use this product same way . just don't let this get your eyes ! putting saturated cotton pad over each eye might help . it contains : green papaya concentrate , sunflower oil , unfiltered hawaiian honey , citrus oil extract , vitamin acetate , ceteareth 20 , methylparaben , propylparaben , diazolidinyl urea . helps repair sun damage , remove age spots other discolorations . also try zia acne treatment mask which used spot treatment or help control breakouts . it contains colloidal sulphur , silica , camphor tea tree essential oil . look pumpkin exfloiating mask citrus night time reversal . zia products cruelty free ! this product must all skin types ! ~ therebeccareview.com	1

i really like twinlab amino fuel quick convenient protein boost , prefer it over any competing products i've seen , two reasons : taste , which reminds me orange-juice concentrate honey , very easy palate . competing products tend overpowering , sickly sweet or gamy flavors which hard swallow after awhile . amount amino acids per serving much higher than most , greater net gain less consumed	1

after many years multiblade , titanium , battery powered , " real man " shaving systems who blades last 2 shaves i decided try something new . i must admit i've never experienced closer , more satisfying shave outside old fashioned barbershop . this well made razor last many years . it simplistic design , solid construction , quality finish sure make this my lifetime razor . thank you merkur	1
this razor small but important learning curve . if you're used using something like mach 3 ( my first wet shave razor)or any multi-blades this take some getting used . small easy strokes absolutely no pressure except weight this razor way go . one stroke one side , stroke other then rense . one pass grain most way go but if you desire closer shave then i suggest re-lather , ( which important wetshaving ) lightly shave across , not against grain . those wanting good shave , you spend little more time than using multiblade razors . i suggest badger hair brush some traditional shave cream or soap like geo . trumpers or trufitt or taylor old bond street . plan no less than five minutes good close shave start lathering toweling off . i also suggest skin food trumpers or some preshave oil art shaving help razor glide . i enjoy this razor way more than any multi-blade i think any user who take time learn use it . if you're constantly hurry shave your way , i don't suggest using this razor or any other double edge or straight razor matter .	1
this scale easy set up use . it reports lot information help weight loss training clear fashion . ability keep track 4 people also very useful household . i can't judge accuracy its body fat readings , but they appear very consistent day day	1

this great when you pets hard floor surfaces since it seems you fighting endless battle fur ! however , it only gets 4 stars because there some cons - they fix these annoying quirks it 5 stars ! cons : * battery loses power very quickly - so fast ! ( approx . 10-20 minutes depending how long it charged prior )* it takes entire day fully charge * if you fully charge it unplug it out using it , it loses power * filter isn't replaceable ( swiffer , apparently there some dirtdevil filter fits)pros : * picks up hair crumbs all dust/dirt cloth * light weight * no cord drag around * even sucks up walls corners ( when fully charged )	1
i love this item ! i tell anyone i how great it i not miss my broom dust pan one single bit ! i would buy one heart beat my husband makes fun me how much i praise it i am using it . i would 100% reccommend it anyone who feels like they constantly sweeping their floor all messes our kids make . buy this today you won't regret it	1

my wife ( mid-50 ) hip replacement therapy last week , so i scoured all amazon reviews find what she would need recover home rather than rehab center . she operated tuesday returned home friday able walk few steps climb stairs . kit came handy right start . - reach extender - works really well it her favorite item kit . she able pick up coins floor it . there small magnet tip , but magnet isn't very strong . won't pick up glass or soda because jaws aren't wide enough , but hasn't issue her . there other types extenders you buy , if you need this capability . - dressing aid - she keeps this upstairs use bed bath uses it like reach extender pick up clothes towels . also used put slippers more easily than shoe horn . - sock aid - ingenious device really works . it bit stiff which requires some effort get sock it , but probably loosen use . even works nylon hosiery . - shoe horn long handled sponge - nothing fancy , but they job . i spent first 5 days home helping her out , but after , this kit elevated toilet seat only items she needed take care herself allowed me return back work . bonus tip : her surgeon suggested using plastic food wrap wrap around her leg , hip torso keep her dressing dry while showering . i replaced regular showerhead handheld sprayer flexible hose . this combination allowed her shower without getting her dressing wet during first week home hospital	1

works advertised . won't make blade shavers happy but i've using dry electric shavers years this works me . nose/ear trimmer pleasantly quiet which concern if you're sticking it your ear	1
i'm pretty young shaver i've only 1 other electric razor compare this , so i can't really speak lot experience . my old shaver bottom-of-the-line norelco simply tore my face shreds . there none this 30 days adjust thing , it just always uncomfortable shave . now i'm shaving more frequently however i thought i'd get decent one this panasonic great . i fairly sensitive face but i think my beard only needed 4 or 5 days fully adjust . even if razor dry , it shaves very close doesn't irritate my skin . unless i'm running late i usually use some edge gel , which works like dream this razor . i kind would preferred maybe stand or small cut price instead nosehair trimmer , but that just minor gripe . if you get this razor though , make sure you clean it after every time you use it . all you squirt some liquid/gel soap it turn it then rinse it off . there very little effort involved because replacement razor heads aren't cheap , it would your best interests just get habit cleaning it	1
i bought this my husband christmas . he liked using it so far no complaints it . it seems well made nice job removing his facial hair . ear trimmer just nice bonus .	1

i several these glasses now . love them . they strong adjustable so much better then wearing granny cord around your neck . i wish there berrer looking sunglass besides goggle looking one . good price good product .	1
i really excited when i saw these reading glasses split nose bar , how nifty , just wear them looped over back your neck click lens part together whenever you read fine print . great idea , but execution idea not everyone . back piece also hard plastic , rigid , if you long hair , you lift them out under your hair place plastic back strip your mid-skull level , fit them your ears then fit front parts together snap . back you end up looking like you wearing external orthodontic apparatus . i'd like see company put string place hard plastic loops around your neck . magnetic clip brings two lenses together front fabulous idea , two lenses hanging off sides instead whole pair glasses swaying across your front so much more comfortable out way - it just rigid frame back makes me wonder if anyone really tried using these things before they mass manufactured	1
