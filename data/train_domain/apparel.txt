like last reviewer said it tricky put using little straps go around your bra ... fact . front closure bra might help some . even though i ( finally after lot cussing ) got straps around my bra , garment still gapped underneath bra both sides back strap , which right middle . only place back there strap hold whole back girdle up . then there one strap under each arm goes around your bra there . it pulled down my bra there causing scrunching . there one strap front middle too , which i don't need use . directions say attach spanx/straps bra ' step ' into garment . right !! much easier said than . it stay up properly back i think it needs straps not only right middle , but also left right middle , under arm ones . i can't really use mine ... waste money , i already removed tags can't send it back . i spanx same but without little straps i can't use either , it creep down back . unless you don't move . so altogether i spent $150 spanx stuff i can't use . there must better way fasten those straps .... maybe sturdy snaps or velcro or something , they should fasten right top edge garment , it they hook half inch down inside causes top edge tend roll out cause bulk there . not happy	-1
i found these shoes searching women option running shoes . name may say unisex , but there no indication sizing 100% male . not even note stating woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes her normal shoe size . when shoes arrived here , they huge . i tried return them , but amazon considers this my fault , planned charge back any shipping , promotions coupons against possible refund . i very well using coupon , sale , " buy $80 worth shoes get $20 off instantly " promotion amazon prime , so my " refund " would less than nothing . that right -- if i return shoes , i owe money . because amazon made no mention shoes found women section site might men shoes instead . yeah , seems fair	-1

( old 6.7 oz ) . ones i am returning less substantial - especially if you stretch them see through them which you can't my old ones . next , it seems they also extended inseam length . it 32 inches old sport knit pants before washing - 31.5 after . ones i received after washed inseams measuring nearly 33 inches . finally , if i wasn't feeling self conscious enough my bod , pants narrowed hips thighs . you get picture ? waist sags rolls . seat major baggy . my belly button shows . they stretch across my hips so there those stupid horizontal lines where they pull crotch . they sucked tight my thighs , then ballon out my knees feet . they're too long , so you can't even see my feet . i spent 30 minutes phone " specialist " land end she couldn't explain why all changes . that also where i got all above new specs . also , spoke specialist ll bean their new specs identical . i spend so much each year land end i get gift card chrismas them . so , i'm not casual purchaser their product . buyer beware get new specs before you buy product you think you know rely . you " . if you land end or ll bean customer - call them complain . they've this past , then bring back " old " version . so , it wasn't broke land end always sold out or back ordered their sport knit pants ) so whose dim-bulb idea it " fix " them ????	-1

ok , i don't why this bra available any size larger than cup , because it just not provide needed support women larger bust ( i see available here 38 dd , i shudder think anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing ) . it comfortable enough worn around house , under jammies , little support when just relaxing , but if you looking something hold you place through day , this bra won't it . front closure just doesn't allow any lift or support . unless you possess smaller chest , skip this one	-1

i received my new shoes this afternoon took test run . i didn't really buy this a3 its " functionality " but rather look . i thought honey comb color combination look kinda cool . however , i not all feel " propelled through every foot " , so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff . i even poked it my hand , oh man it hard . i also tried jumping up down try feel bounciness , but all i feel my feet stomping hard onto cement . btw , if your feet wide flat like mine , it going very uncomfortable when walking these shoes . *** update *** november 15 , 2006it 2 months since i've wearing these shoes , i've changed my opinion them . once you get use a3 sequence , they actually quite comfortable . honeycombs under heels make every step little bouncier now . maybe it takes time soften up material make them more flexible	-1

this classic style work boot which used lot more common than now , even appearing one episode " leave it beaver " late ' 50s , cover one simon garfunkles albums late ' 60s . i've owned several pair similar boots other makers , including red wing . some comments which apply this style general , ( not just wolverines ): pros - wedge sole absorbs lot shock making them great standing/working concrete , or walking long distances hard surfaces . also , non-agressive tread means dirt grass doesn't track into house after doing chores outside . moc toe tends breath through seams , so feet tend stay cooler drier hot , dry conditions . great boot desert , apparantly highly esteemed many construction workers . cons - wedge sole doesn't offer much traction serious hiking steep , loose surfaces ( which i've used them , but which they really weren't intended ) . gravel roll right out under them . none several brands i owned water-resistant all . walking through wet grass lead wet socks very quickly , seams around toe which allow air perspiration escape also allow outside moisture enter just easily . we used say " your feet get wet two days before it rains " . so , perhaps not best choice hiking pacific northwest . specifically , wolverines extemely comfortable right out box . they better insole than any my previous boots this style , removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support . color actually more brown clay , rather than what i would call tan . quality workmanship appeared pretty good , actually better looking stitching than my red wings . however i disappointed variable nature leather . leather most boot appeared adequately thick , however leather used shaft around ankles thinner than i ever seen any work boot , thinner even than many suede sneakers . while my ankles covered , they didn't feel all supported or protected . after considering couple days , i decided return boots merchant who provided them amazon , sportsmans guide . they provided return shipping label box , so i taped box closed , applied label , took it post office . i received email few days later acknowledging their receipt package , notice credit applied my account . so , while i'm not very excited particular pair boots which i received , i give good marks sportsmans guide quick relatively painless return . i ended up purchasing georgia spr 6 " farm ranch boot , wedge sole , also available through amazon . further details , please see my review	-1

i these black , while i find them go just every outfit i wear work , i wish they just little ( read : quite lot ) less uncomfortable . firstly , insole provided doesn't seem fit inside shoe properly . almost like it too wide . my foot neither narrow nor wide , so this isn't something i typically notice shoe . there arch , but because weirdly shaped insole it doesn't provide any support . zig zap strap really cute feature i love , but it just adds uncomfort shoe . you tighten strap keep your foot sliding around inside , but then it cuts off circulation leaves painful imprints . if you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable . all all , versatile mary jane good looks but no comfort	-1

we purchased these boots my husband who works construction field(mainly insulation instalation ) which requires him climb high places , walk trusses , also under floors sometimes standing water other harsh weather conditions . my opinion these boots not " heavy duty " rubber soles all but cheap soles start rub crumble almost immediately under working conditions . there also no arch or foot support inside boot itself . there piece leather saying " made china " that it . tag even reccomends getting some sort insole . worst part tag boot it states you should get next size up than what your normal boot size . seller not state this fact . all all , if you purchasing these boots long term wear or work related activities i not reccomend them . if they teenager making fashion statement or halloween costume they're perfect	-1

i am great shape . however , i cannot get over so many men underwear products waist bands constrict exasperarate blood flow muscle tension . obviously they made china where average waist 25 inches . idea " medium " marketed ridiculous healthy american standards . my body fat low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . common men my age , lower back problems not unusual . i 32 " waist . not " medium " sized ? i think we simply need get rid elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all doesn't work it dangerous those many us fight our lower back problems . draw string fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems fashion , anyway . just give us option pulling shorts back up instead pinching nerves static elastic waist band causes ridiculous lower back problems because unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers don't hold up well any kind washing . they looked like crap after first time i washed them . i wish i could get refund because i won't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like " old men " underwear . sad embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash light dry . i am not mean hearted kind guy . so , i am going shut my mouth now not business you again .	-1
it awful . size too big me ( my waistline 34 sizing chart it says " size fits 26-36 " )so i end up cut it sew it back so it fit me . then after 3 days wearing it , velcro messed up , it not attached together anymore . costumer service answering machine ( i tried several times call costumer service , only get machine answer my call ) . i not return item , because it says its illegal return this kind item . so my advise , dont buy this item or you'll sorry .	-1

i looking good nursing nightgown wear while hospital after giving birth my second child . i seen aimee gown before , i really liked looks it , reviews seemed great . after purchasing gown ( shipped via fed ex canada , which means i got dinged fedex " customs broker " costs ... ) i tried it while 8 months pregnant see how it fits . i purchased size xl i am around sz 14 pre-pregnancy . i normal bust size 36d . gown itself made nice heavyweight cotton lots stretch recovery ( doesn't just stretch out stay there ) , crossover top really nice becuase it crosses over easy pull aside nursing , but isn't too deep ( nobody needs see * * much my clavicle ) . there slit up side ease walking , but it very high slit , too high , i felt . gown didn't fit well over my pregnant belly - but i don't fault them , it not advertised fitting during pregnancy . however , after giving birth , i still don't think it would fit well first couple weeks , until baby belly subsides bit . gown stretches well enough fit over slowly-declining bump , but unfortunately , you walk around , elastic contracts gown back up over your bump , pulling slit side higher higher up your leg . gown itself long enough more than cover your bump it retracts , but it not comfortable feeling when slit creeps higher higher . bustline great when i'm nursing - easy pull over , great coverage other side . it fits well under bust ( elasticised under cups ) but i found cups huge my breasts . it fit well band , but i guess they figure if you're big girl , you must big boobs . luckily , i'm handy sewing , so i plan take gown up shoulders fix this . overall , i think this great gown wear around house while breastfeeding .... after baby belly subsided . i plan bring it hospital me , but only after i've taken seams shoudlers , closed side slit bit	-1

this tee-shirt my first under armour purchase , i took chance ordering it without ever trying any under armour before . i'm not dissatisfied , but it isn't my favorite tee-shirt . positive side : weight fabric good exercising , especially gym , it would good single layer outside/warm temperatures . fit pretty good ( i am average sized wear sizes 8-10 ); i don't like really tight clothing this shirt loose enough comfortable but fitted enough so it doesn't look like i'm wearing bag . negative side : i am little short-waisted , shirt long me bunches top my hips , which i don't like but accept . also , vee-neck not very strong vee ( pictures this shirt true respect ) . lot technical tees like this -- designed more function than style maybe -- vee-necks essentially crew vee hybrid . i prefer true vee-neck . lastly , fabric slightly rough , scratchy feel , which seems characteristic today technical fabrics . it not clear me cost " hand " worth added function " wicking " this instance . overall , i consider this shirt fine gym or hour-long run , but i wouldn't want spend lot extended time it .	-1

this product every breastfeeding mother needs know . finally solution leaking way sleep without wearing bra ! i've using lilypadz month now i must say i love them . when i started breastfeeding my daughter i using traditional round cotton pads you put inside your bra soak up leaks . i hated them because they look terrible under snug fitting shirt , they don't always absorb all liquid , they shift out position leaving you no protection all . i assumed it just necessary evil breastfeeding because i didn't know something wonderful lilypadz existed ! i admit , when i first saw them advertised i skeptical . i didn't think they would stick , i didn't think they would stay place , i thought sure if they stick it would hurt take them off or they'd leave tacky residue my breast . i hestitated couple weeks , wanting try them , but afraid i'd spend all money end up disappointed . it one morning after waking up soaked because one my cotton pads slipped during night i decided i would risk it order them . when they arrived i read all instructions ready try them out . now this embarrassing part ... instructions it specifically says take them off plastic dome before using . some reason i thought they meant take them out plastic container . i didn't realize each lilypad also stuck piece plastic ! when i first tried put them i actually tried flipping entire pad plastic dome inside out . ( yes it tough too !! ) i frustrated because they obviously didn't stick . i began think my fear them not working true . once i realized my stupid mistake , i peeled them off plastic tried again . they stuck perfectly !! try avoid problem i .. make sure you peel each them off their little plastic domes . i immediately surprised how secure they felt . i knew right away i would able wear them bed not worry one falling off . my next fear removing them . i carefully lifted up edge peeled one off . i surprised even though they stuck securely , they peeled off ease without causing pain my tender breasts . i estatic ! what great product !! i found after using them month there pros cons . however pros greatly outweigh cons . this what i found ... pros ------ 1 ) attaches securely2 ) removes very little or no pain3 ) no residue left behind breast . baby eat soon pad removed . 4 ) protects tender breasts rubbing against clothing or sticking cotton pads . ( if you feeling sore these huge help . ) 5 ) secure enough stay all night long without wearing bra . 6 ) washable reusable7 ) invisible under snug fitting shirts . 8 ) when properly applied you not leak9 ) peace mind 10 ) quick drying . after cleaning them give them good shake you ready reapply them ( even if they bit damp still ) . no need buy more than one pair unless you need peace mind back up . one pair work always ready use . cons ------- 1 ) if not properly applied you might leak . you must careful avoid air bubbles make sure you apply strong pressure nipple when putting them . however , even if you leak - it won't get your clothes . instead it pools up around nipple . it usually stays sealed . you just sure remove pad , drain liquid , rinse them then reapply properly . one warning , if you air bubble you leak lot it possible pad loosen pop off spilling milk you . this only happened me maybe twice after long night leaking while sleeping . i leaked during night , woke up feeding baby one side without checking see if i leaked other . my milk let down filling air bubble more pad popped off drenching me . 2 ) if you own cats/dogs ... keep them away pads when you aren't wearing them . they attract fur like crazy . if they get furry its ok because it wash off . its just pain butt takes little extra effort3 ) takes little more effort reapply pad public ( vs shoving cotton pad back your bra ) but once you get hang it , it woudn't even make con list anymore . 4 ) i personally don't wear them every day . i'm one those types thinks skin should chance breathe little . i wear them every night , but during day i'll occasionally wear my cotton pads so my skin breathe . i'm afraid i'll end up thrush or just pruney nipples if i wore them 24/7 . i no evidence back up claim - they may work just fine 24/7 . i'd say i wear them 3-4 times week during day . i not go night without wearing them though because i hate wearing bra bed . you see pros outweigh cons quite bit . cons shouldn't enough keep you trying them yourself . even if you plan wearing them only night they well worth cost . if you like me you skeptical - don't . these really work you glad you gave them try . every breastfeeding mother should own pair i think they would make wonderful unique baby shower gift !	1

these most comfortable things i ever worn my feet ; i bought them halloween i'm so happy i ; they my new house shoes . but just case you didn't know : straps only attached back slipper ; so you sew them into front- i'm assuming proper fit ; this bit annoying- coupled fact there no loop or area fabric sew them into without see your handy work through front(no good if your terrible sewing like me ); they soil easily ; this should expected course(especially if they white ) . still , my title suggests , they earn 5 stars more because they truly comfortable ; especially if your house carpeted ; i can't well explain why , because shoes really no padding ; but they hug your feet support your arch extent ( i'm assuming these would not comfortable flat footed people ) . price great , if you into ballet , what you loose	1

i saw these shoes macy yesterday $36 . they only red . imo , red bright , clown red . it not bad red , it just true red no subtlety . i almost considered getting them , but i reminded myself i hunt black patent , pointy toe skimmer . i am * so * glad macy not black because i got them thru amazon $22 . i believe shoe fits true size . i am 7.5 , period . pointy shoes , i sometimes go 8 or avoid pointys altogether . i going listen reviews here order 8 , but i tried 8 macy it too big . i think it bit stretched it given it floor model , but i figured even brand new size 8 would too big . i ordered recvd 7.5 . when i recvd shoes today put them they snug . not snug tight or uncomfortable way . they just fit exactly my foot . this leather upper not man made . so patent looks black shiny ! it not cheap looking all . point comes nice triangle isn't exagerrated . given they leather , i expect them stretch little my feet . shoes measures 10.5 " point middle heel . point top shoe 3 " there 1 " my big toe point . there comfortable room move toes because shoe leather , it form bit feet you wear them . i experienced already just walking around house . shoe looks low cut sides , but my foot stays completely shoe when i am walking . i'll watching see if i end up line/bend across front shoe . time happens -- if it ever -- i certainly gotten my $22 out them . finally , i am 5'2 " i tend avoid pointy toe shoes because it sometimes looks like i am wearing skis . these shoes great because they elongate my leg don't create costume-y look . they look great peeking out jeans i i expect them look good w/the new capri leggings i got other day . highly recommended !	1

these feel great look great , if that all you're wearing . if you wear you pants so high you can't see them , then you really don't need them . if you like really low pants , then you still flash inch or so underwear before your pants really too low . best part , when your pants slipped too low , you pull them back up without underwear bunching up .	1

i thought i getting bargain - rockports discount ! when they arrived , craftsmanship finish impressed me . stitching looked even shine appropriate dress wear . they comfortable enough ( maybe little snug ) , but i though it odd they creased across ( rather than rear ) cap . within few days , however , skin-like coating ( perhaps waterproof layer ? ) uppers separated underlying leather , creating blisters creases . within few weeks , those blisters tore , exposing leather underneath . i'm not sure where this end , but less than 2 months old , they soon look too bad dress wear . , i suspect waterproofing now compromised . i'm glad i didn't pay full price !	-1

after reading quite few negative reviews this bag , i thought i would write review clarify something . this messenger bag , not backpack . messenger bag never meant hold all items backpack . so basically , if you're using this bag school purposes , keep this mind . this bag hold items possibly up 3 classes . so while it perfect college student who might class , then class right after it . this bag would horrible high school student , who might drag home texts six classes . most messenger bags , elefunk bag probably going your best choice , cause its size number compartments . we 3 these bags , 2 which used education , third used utility/diaper family bag . education , i stated before , it best college students . main compartment spans out hold 2 college texts , binders , study guides snug . keyword there snug , cause it not big enough carry more . inside main compartment little sleeve held tight velcro patch . i use this keep my study guides my texts . okay , next comes front pocket attached main compartment . this compartment big enough fit my 12 inch ibook neopreen cover , or 13 inch macbook bare . warning , if you place your macbook this pouch , careful how you toss this bag around , cause it offers no padding very unforgiving . inside this front pouch zippered sleeve fine putting loose change or maybe id cards or what not . next zippered sleeve two pouches pens pencils , even ti calculator , if you're not planning putting your notebook pouch . don't worry though , cause attached pouch outside two zippered compartments opposite one front pouch . one side i put my black leather data file , other side , i put my ti-89 calculator . then leaves flap , which secured bag using strong plastic clips . front pouch zippered compartment . which i pretty much only use it pack up couple magazines read , if i'm waiting classes . you also use it pack up headphones or earbuds , listen you ipod or whatever . shoulder strap , it comfy it going get . keep mind , you're lugging 20 30 pounds books supplies , it not suppose feel like chinese massage . but i can't complain . family bag . eh , i wouldn't suggest this newly mother who wants go down mall . cause stores not let your take this bag there . but if you're trip , or going flight , this bag excellent . you pack away all your babies needs , other essentials . anyway , i just didn't like seeing product i use , like , getting knocked , cause couple people misjudged how use it properly . again , if you're taking more than 2 or 3 classes time , this bag isn't you . but if you're run mill college student , who takes class or two time , then goes home . this bag must	1

i travel lot ! i would recommend this everyone . it extremely compact convenient . it helps " know " ahead time what your luggage weighs avoid switching swapping items bag bag and/or paying extra fees overweight luggage- not mention holding up line . : -	1
theoretically speaking , this seems handy little doo-dad/gizmo/thingamabob well-organized/obsessive-compulsive traveler , but please take note following pros cons . pros : 1 . it gives you fairly accurate preview weight your luggage (+/- few ounces ) saving you irritation arriving airline counter over-heavy luggage , repack shuffle potentially embarrassing items around full view other passengers . 2 . you use tape measure verify your carry-on luggage fit overhead compartment , or under seat . this saves you participating dreaded ruthless shoving tournament skies , where people try stuff bags size newborn elephants into overhead lockers . cons : 1 . it capacity weigh suitcases up 75 lbs , but when you're traveling alone , it very awkward lift suitcase even half weight your arms extended ( so it doesn't touch your body ) still read tiny numbers dial . 2 . handle small " ergonometrically-challenged " , people who can't lift 50 lb suitcase one outstretched hand find it very difficult get two hands there . even if you manage get this far , you won't able hold it long before handle sinks deep into your palm , cutting you new lifeline . 3 . you need try balance suitcase centering hook suitcase handle , but if you lift too quickly , hook slips one side , causing possible grievous bodily harm suitcase comes down your toe . 4 . hook problem - you see hook open design . if you lifting suitcase , hook slip off way up , causing suitcase fall 3 . above . even worse , momentum keeps your hand moving upwards , not only you give yourself shiner or broken nose back your hand , but hook swing up jab you eye . ( true story)you use it lighter luggage without too many problems , but then again , if your luggage light you no need fear scale - you ? surface this sounds like great travel gadget , but beware pitfalls . amanda richards , september 22 , 200	-1

i love look feel this bra . it not classic compression bra , but encapsulation -- it separate cups . addition , it not made all cotton , but special moisture wicking material , very comfortable . i purchased this bra three times , it perfect when i 34b -- provided plenty support i loved how it thick enough i never showed through my tank top when exercising , but now i am 34d , i don't think this bra provides enough support when i am doing high impact activities like running or kickboxing . low medium activities this sports perfect still . but since i taken up more rigorous activities , i bought panache bra ( make sure buy your exact size panache )	-1
love them !!! exactly pictured !!!! got two pairs ... one gold one silver	1

well constructed , well padded case your small digital camera . i like it ample storage pocket extra batteries sd cards , i like easy-open u-shaped zippers . no corners negotiate , no top cover flip up hold out way while you butterfinger your camera out case . pretty weatherproof shockproof , too . it provides great protection your camera . i got little carried away kept usb cable my camera accessory pocket two extra batteries media card . this actually worked several months (!) before i broke zipper . i could bought differently designed replacement case locally -- there dozens dozens them -- but none anything like suited my needs tastes this little caselogic . so i ordered one amazon exactly like one i ruined . if there anything i'd change case , it would add small hand strap . but that not issue me . if i want carry it my hand , i just slip finger through belt look carry it way . i've learned my lesson storing usb cable accessory pocket . so i'm expecting replacement easily outlast my camera	1

i researched this thouroughly before buying . i wanted nice looking case would protect entrie thing little extra space added my ipod . this case all . i got red ( blaze ) color , i love it . it even feels good touch . i cut out space hold switch area around headphone port , but i don't see any sort problem . i just got my ipod today already dropped it , but i feel safe secure knowing i my evo3 case my beautiful ipod . definitely worth price	1
previously , i owned leather flip-face cover my ipod video it worked fine while , but flexible screen cover became " loose " began scratch screen . this product exactly what described . " iskin evo3 athletic protective case " hard plastic see through cover fits over entire front ipod . silicon cover soft ( sticky so it prevents sliding - especially if you remove clip ) easy put . case covers whole ipod except headphone jack " flap " fits over ( into ) connection bottom . you use click wheel slide top through silicon . it also looks pretty good . only thing takes some getting used silicon over click wheel . it , like click wheel when i first got ipod , takes some getting used . it pretty thin tends buckle if you push hard . ( don't worry , though . it fixes itself when you pick up your finger . ) if you're looking good quality , semi cool looking , funcional cover , this pretty good choice . either way , enjoy share your music whenever you !!	-1

briefly , i childhood accident 30+ years ago caused arthritis my foot . not bad , but constant , nagging pain sensation i learned just live . finally , i saw podiatrist who referred me pedorthist fitted footwear could alleviate my pain . i wound up pair birkenstock sandals i've never turned back . they're great . no more foot pain , period . i wear dress socks sandals work everyday ( office environment -- i got flack co-workers , but needling didn't bother me management never took me task , either ) , church , everywhere . i've different pair birkies beach lawn work -- not comfortable suede uppers these arizona . mocha suede straps held up wonderfully despite getting wet lightly soiled time time . admittedly , it lot money spend , but shoe store my pedorthist works re-soles birkies $30 , replace cork sole both $50 . re-soled sandals last year , but remember , i wear them daily i often walk few miles each day . short , these sandals dramatically improved quality my life foot arthritis no longer any concern me . not bad little more than $100	1

i bought these socks strength other reviews . i won't repeat what these reviewers said except say i agree they best white socks you get . however , i add some additional information they not necessarily mention . these socks obviously well made fairly thick . however , they not too thick which concern i . they much thicker softer than gold toes cotton crew socks , but you must also pay this i.e. $9.00 vs . $15.00 . other hand , i estimate these socks stand up laundering better , last much longer stay up repeated washing . exact composition these socks : 84% combed cotton , 15% stretch nylon 1% spandex . less expensive socks i reference above 82% combed cotton , 17% stretch nylon 1% spandex . one would think this wouldn't make much difference terms durability , but there seems more weight material overall higher quality socks . i also some experience white cotton crew socks while they absorbent because high cotton content , i don't feel they held up repeated washing well . i also don't think they much better than less expensively priced socks other manufacturers . however , white fluffies quantum leap up worth extra money	1

size mesh this quite good since it still very much fishnet , but woven tightly enough so it doesn't tear easily . method used keep fishnet ' down ' ( towards your hand ) single clothen loop goes around your middle finger , if you keep fishnet pulled down far enough this fine comfortable , but if you allow ' bottom ' lower part fishnet , near heal your hand , slip upward your wrist , this pull loop likely leave deep mark your finger 10-15 minutes after taking off fishnets . overall pretty good product what it says it , well worth price , these pretty decent quality	-1

i just love birkenstock boston clogs . i've owned them black leather , dark gray suede , bright yellow suede . ( last these turned some heads , but they cool enough -- situation where some rough characters afoot -- nobody bothered me . ) they awesomely comfortable . my tour guide israel stupefied them when i demonstrated following : flex your knee , raising your calf until parallel ground , keeping your foot perpendicular ground , -- even without clench your toes -- clog not fall off . eytan watched spellbound i this over over . secret ? you'll notice your foot gets slightly wider behind metatarsal heads then narrows again both directions ( phalangead calcad , podiatrists might say ) . boston so expertly crafted -- so balanced anatomically perfect foo t--t hat material stretch just wide enough admit those protuberant metatarsal heads , then spring back just tight enough hold them place . it fun mesmerizing eytan : he so arrogant	1

i got 30 30 my son , they fit just right . i think they're bit baggier butt than 501 , though . they well made should last quite while . color regular stone-wash , not dark it states , somewhat lighter than color your screen . we prefer dark denim , but price , you can't beat it .	-1
i bit skeptical first these levi first . long time 505 guy , i thought their must lower line jeans levi they releasing big chain stores , saving their regular levi name department stores . well , finally i broke down look pair these jeans when i say they sale . i astonished , they exactly same jean , average $10 less . look closely , stitching same , even position inside labels . buttons rivits same well . main difference back pockets don't little red levi tag , " " shaped decorative detail stich . otherwise these same jeans . they fit just well , i think even better , but may because my wallet bit fuller fit after buying these . after 15 years 505 , i found new favorite . seriously , check these out , you wont dissapointed . even better , they kids line , so your growing kids you get same levi quality less , nice when they grow out jeans so fast . if you worried where they manufactured , i tell you last 20 pairs levi i made either mexico , columbia , or somewhere asia , so these made egypt not big deal , least they grow cotton their . note : button fly 501 people , they not line signature button flys , so you stick regular levi . probably smart marketing move , but these genes suprised me , levi may suprise again	1
they look better person , arevery comfortable . service grea	1
i love these shoes . these real tennis shoes , made tennis . means lightweight , durable , good walking . they're beautiful little things . many people not know full history these italian leather babies , but those who know upper echelon . ellesse name based initials , l.s. , its founder , leonardo servadio , italian tailor innovative approach styling manufacture . 1959 , servadio created revolutionary stretch ski pant which established ellesse among elite alpine social circles , making it ultimate aspirational brand . immense success ellesse winter sports clothing provided perfect passport expand brand transfer design philosophy into equally prestigious world tennis . 1976 , servadio seized opportunity take brand onto worldwide stage embarked aggressive sponsorship programme signing tennis legends such boris becker , chris evert lloyd guillermo vilas . ellesse became synonymous tennis skiing testimony success ellesse these highly competitive fields , ellesse logo , consisting half tennis ball combined 2 ski tips , surmounting company name , created . i must also warn there few pairs this particular line minor defect , which there one shoe where sole comes loose . this fixed little rubber cement , but if you don't want bothered , just send it back it easily exchanged , shipping costs reimbursed back you . even small hassle , you can't beat sharply reduced price featured here ! my favorite pick white/tan/brown . just sure keep laces clean	1

well $99 i thought this would good running shoe . so far it seemed okay maybe takes while break cause i haven't felt bounce yet . when i received my shoes i noticed hole bottom sides shoe thought this not good idea . but then i figured if it rains insoles , my weight , would block any water getting shoe . well i wrong . it rained road muddy so now good pair white socks trashed . wet mud came through all holes shoe including insoles which also holes them . shoes covered mud now so i don't think i send them back .	-1
i bought this swimsuit because current style baggy surfer shorts extremely uncomfortable swimming laps ( ok , i admit i also inspired bond movie , casino royale ) . but i didn't want go all out get those tiny suits olympic swimmers europeans wear so this nice compromise . remember it snug , tight suit so if you normally wear medium pair surfing trunks , you'll want large size here cause it feel uncomfortably tight make you feel very self-conscious when you step out changing room . material very good . it stretches well , dries quickly . elastic waistband , however , not attached so everytime you take off suit , waistband elastic gets all twisted around . it not difficulat manually twist ' em back into shape -- but it still annoying . because it so snug , there no pockets any kind no place put your locker key . overall , it good product . but you better not self-conscious your body -- this man equivalent thong bikini ( considering how modest men -- least american men's-- swimwear become ) . i felt very self-conscious first but since i only wore them gym swim laps , i didn't care so much how i looked i really appreciated fact this comfortable swim . but now , after year dedicated working out , i'm starting look good these swimtrunks really accentuate broad shoulders tight abs . i even wear them around house cause it drives my wife nuts ( good way ) . now james bond wore something like these casino royale , it won't too weird me wear this beach this summer	-1

my husband prefered 100% nylon socks since he wearing suits work . among 100% nylon sock , he prefers gold toe brand . i can't tell why because i haven't asked , but i assume they everything he wants over-the-calf sock because he hasn't looked elsewhere . he buying them joseph banks , but they stopped carrying 100% nylon , he didn't like mixed fibers . he asked me find them , i went straight amazon	1

best swim suit i ever seen usi strongly believe this best speedo suits i ever bought this country . swim suites made very soft elastic fabric , it not cause itchiness your waste , hips , crotch , which usually happens when you put small speedos like this . suits actually only one inch cloth sides , you may move your legs water very easily , it makes your swim performance far better than other speedos . good feature this suit there many variation color . i own white , black dark blue one . i personally not recommend one white very light color , since it become absolutely see-through when wet . i know there one big concern when men wearing this suite . here my comment someone who not confidence wear them swimming pool : frank , my friends told me suits little revealing since those high-leg cut made thin fabric . fact , even darker colors , shape your " manhood " somewhat revealed especially when wet these suits . ( but not see-through ) however , don't you think it always happens when you any speedos long you " organ ? " it absolutely more strange if part completely flat . addition , any swimming suits more or less this feature . if you person who thinks unfavorable , you may want stop swimming pool other work outs . other words , people might see you package occasionally since it high leg cut adhere your body . however who cares , stares , makes fun it all time when you swimming pool ? suites cover only essential part because it made swim fast , but absolutely not reveal your manhood pull attention others . don't you agree ? i recommend you try it least once if you swimmers who seriously want swim fast . price around $20 , it affordable second swim ware . i realized actual size waist this suite might little bigger than jeans or pants . therefore , you feel more comfortable if you buy one size smaller . like myself , i usually ware jeans or pants size 29 . therefore i chose 28 perfectly fit me . fabric elastic , it stretches bit . however , if you worry size , just buy exact size . i love this suit ware it all least once week . other people wrote previously , color fades relatively fast pool water . therefore , i would suggest you buy two pairs wear it turns .	1
i didn't know if i would happy ordering this item through amazon but it ok . just like buying it store .	1

i bought these shirts ( black , medium ) wear daily basis , i am disappointed . first off , they don't fit like old ck crew necks ... they , fact , shorter waist wider . length isn't bad- it waist width too large makes shirt ill-fitting . ( i average body-type ) after just few washings , some stitching started coming undone , there loose strands inner parts shirts . i'm continually trimming these loose ends . although didn't affect way these shirts fit , i would expect better stitching ck . i wear shirts under sweaters or jackets , but i feel awkward wearing them their own outerwear due fit . i don't recommend these shirts . i'd rather pay more american apparel or banana republic	-1

i received money clip which advertised really nice box . money clip less than what described display box damaged huge nick top . i returned money clip company assured me they would send replacement not damaged . second replacement item just bad , if not , worse than first . company simply packages their items " padded envelope " which , obviously , doesn't protect items damage . never buy them again suggest amazon customers not use company either	-1

huuricane wash light blue , quite soft " slubby " lightweight denim . but nice comfortable well-broken . while much negative commentary concerning levi strauss move away domestic manufacturing focused button-fly 501s , bigger problem i seen old 1970 standby , 505 , which zipper opposed button fly . variability sizing sew quality 505s issue if you going buy them online or mail order . 501 easier buy online or mail order because sizing much less critical waist , which so-called " anti-fit " waist , meaning there no curve rise ( distance crotch top waist ) , because original 501s merely cut down bib overalls which made hang , rather than fitted waist . biggest problem i noted 505 variability size thigh area , meaning some fit baggy some seem rather tight , even though they theoretically same size label . 501s pretty safe far sizing .	1

i entitled review " cautiously optimistic " because relatively short period time i worn this garment i am still reserving bit judgement regarding its durability . stated , i very impressed support this bra . larger-than-average chest size ( bra i purchased " " cup ) i become accustomed purchasing bras which offer support initially only , if you'll pardon pun , let me down within week or so wearing them . " tisha " offered solid support . this bra hiked my bosom up kept it up all day . i not experienced any sagging or shifting garment . i mentioned support excellent , it even passed " jiggle test " . if i hurry somewhere or , heaven forbid , break into jog " girls " stay where they ought offering no threat injury me or any innocent passer-by . side supports , no doubt part reason bra effectiveness but they pinch bit . short , it feels good take bra off end day . i not however fantasize slipping out it lunchtime ease aching shoulders or alleviate pain i some others . bra , quite naturally , very personal garment therefore difficult recommend but i recommend this bra large-busted women . i would happily trade scores $30-$40 dollar " mistakes " this style .	-1

while much negative commentary concerned levi strauss move away domestic manufacturing focused button-fly 501s , bigger problem i seen old 1970 standby , 505 , which zipper opposed button fly . variability sizing sew quality 505s issue if you going buy them online or mail order . you really try them see how they fit . 501 much easier buy online or mail order because sizing much less critical waist , which so-called " anti-fit " waist , meaning there no curve rise ( distance crotch top waist ) , because original 501s merely cut down bib overalls which made hang , rather than fitted waist . biggest problem i noted 505 variability size thigh area , meaning some fit baggy some seem rather tight , even though they theoretically same size label . since 501s more forgiving far sizing , if you buying online you might consider them instead 505s , unless you don't want button fly .	1

cost -- i thought -- might well try this gadget--there no real large financial investment , so if it looks or behaves goofy , i'll just toss it trash . so , my husband buttons one end tiedown , slides tiedown through necktie nametag ( shorter necktie end tucked also ) buttons tiedown other end . i would've bet money fact you could see edges this ' cheap ' tie holder or tie just wouldn't lie right . well , i right . tie crumpled all up looked goofy -- until we moved tiedown down one button . then i my husband stand up straight , lean forward , lean side side ......... omg .... i could not see tiedown all , tie completely well-behaved ! we thrilled this new gadget ! hubby worn it week -- not heard one comment colleagues ' unusual ' tie holder . because no one see it ! i one suggestion though -- they should sold packs three or five -- way if one gets broken kids , chewed up dog , or lost dear hubby , then you'll extras hand . so , meantime , few when you order ! ( i didn't realize time this review multi-pack available ) . this product eventually sold high quality retail shops -- get them while they're still so cheap , because once designers get hold them , they'll crank price up so high you'll think you're buying slice gold instead plastic !! trust me , i'm stocking up now ! buy ' em . you'll love ' em	1

old standby suddenly wet and/or chilly windy ride wear garbage bag . it works but you would really rather wearing jacket zipped unzipped . decent cycling jacket costs $150 more or less , but if you're novice you don't need blow kind cash , this jacket serve you fine . keep it you just case , see envy others faces they shiver their lycra or suffer sauna conditions wearing garbage bag keep dry because they didn't carry this handy bit easily fits jersey pocket or any kind backpack without too much bulk . keeping wind out alone big way keep warm foul conditions , while continuous riding produce more than enough heat keep you warm most time . if you're heading out , say , nyc five borough bike tour may , don't know what buy , your basics : some kind jersey -- coolmax shirt ; 6 panel or more cycling shorts chamois ( pad ) where sun don't shine ; light / thin socks ( air-e-ators best ); one these jackets . these helmet you're set serious riding . skip bulky layers warmth . if you want bit insulation you may need , get $10 polarfleece vest bargain store , one these jackets . i take one star because it doesn't vented armpits , but second thought i probably shouldn't consideration price value ratio	-1
our family taking extended vacation i wanted surprise my wife travel robe - not too light nor flimsy , but not too bulky either since our bags already full , after vacation , we'd returning our home south . i shopped around locally houston area dept stores surprised i couldn't find decent quality robe . they all cheap poor quality . " needlessly marked-up " great quality robe , but price hundreds dollars range . i then looked online , really tempted buy generic robe ~ $65 price range , but i became leery when i found too many negative reviews complaining poor fabric quality . hence i decided spring luxury spa robe . you should note exterior smooth ( microfiber ) interior cotton terry . my wife really pleased its look quality continues use it regularly . i also bought some matching slippers , she likes those , too . delivery lightning fast ; i received it only 3 days after placing order .	1

this sleeveless tank ck one best i've tried - its soft cotton , stretches fit well comfortable cold warm seasons . stretching quality compensates slight shrinkage happens upon first wash . only downside i see durability- these tanks either lose stretch quality or shape after year or two washing . but who said underwear must last ever ? if you know better tank i would happy hear it . good tanks hard find just like good jeans	-1
we looking insulated bag large enough hold luncheon salads 1- 1.5 quart size plasticware container . this one largest coolers we found online still lunch size . since salad containers round , oblong shape cooler bag gets distorted but it still large enough salads fit . it other cute compartments , some chilled , some not , but my family doesn't use these day day basis . i think they give extra flexibility what carried , though . we ordered same bag 3 colors , one each person . they look if they very durable but we've only them couple months . only negative there not separate pouch ice pack . i hoped all compartments cooler , one would hold ice away chilled food , but not case . it not big deal . just keeps this pretty perfect	-1

wore boxers decade before switching bikinis . i love look comfort support . jockey elance bikinis first i bought , years later , they still what i wear most all . i've since bought many other styles ( boxers , boxer briefs , classic briefs , thongs , other bikini styles ) brands , but it pretty much exception rule when i wear anything but jockey elance . contrary what others said , they well made . i've number them years , they still hold up . i also think they really comfortable . also , someone said they knock off women underwear . jockey made men elance bikinis long before they made any underwear women . however , online you generally only get them black , grey , white , which ok , but not most fun . you get wider variety colors department stores . walmart sells them huge variety colors life brand . but lot better than these hanro cotton stretch brief , also sale amazon . they better made , more comfortable , but extremely pricey . you buy 4 packs these price one those .	1

these best scrubs i ever found . if i put stuff chest pocket , it falls out when i bend over . i'm male nurse , when i wear scrub top two front pockets base i feel like i'm wearing apron . if i put stuff back pocket scrub pants , i sit it . finally , i found my solution ... cargo pockets ! i deduct points because these pants i end up wearing so many pockets i tend forget where i put stuff . if i run , anything heavy cargo pockets annoyingly slaps me legs ( all scrubs loose-fitting my chicken legs ) . but then i gave those points back because " coolness " factor . let face it , cargo pockets make you look like you ready anything ( even if i learned how minimize amount stuff i needlessly carry around ) . like most scrubs , they're very comfortable . new sandwashed material very durable stain resistant . i've washed them many many times they still look like new . dickies great brand one i'll sticking ( unless carhartt starts making scrubs )	1

i am physical therapist . when i got pregnant , i concerned my back how it would hold up during pregnancy . hormone relaxin released pregnancy , our joints loosen up can't support much they non-pregnant state . this especially notable sacroiliac ( si ) joint our low backs . instability this joint ( there one each side ) lead pain . 18 weeks i started some si pain . i got one these belts relief within 24 hours . 2 months i wore it every day support my si joints . i found if i attached velcro strap front securely , but not tight , then used two side straps tighten up whole belt , i would get best relief . i certain two side straps even : seam where they meet back center my back . i would then pull them around same time attach them so fit snug , but not uncomfortable . after couple months , baby started getting so big i started wearing it more support my belly . i've gotten bigger bigger , i've pulled back part upward slightly , which continues provide si support but also helps hold up baby . when i take belt off i really notice difference . support amazing such simple belt ( wish i patent!)i'm due month . i no back pain since before i used belt i continue work exercise without problems	1
these very compfortable pair bikinis . form fitting soft , elastic just enough keep them , they everything you want pair undies , but they don't last . i've wearing bikini style more than decade these good economical alternative brand got me started , calvin kleins . calvins shangri la all others strive . but you got pay . you only get one pair calvins $15 here you get 3 hanes $11 . they almost identical feel , difference construction . hanes only single layer frontal sheild whereas most other bikinis double area up good reason . after year or so your buddy downstairs busy making himself little window who knows what could lead . door or hatch then he could bust out take over . i suppose cost vs . longevity calvins balance out . they cost 4x much but last 4x long . but our partners want us same pair undies more than 5 years ? maybe hanes better buy because you eventually replace them .	-1

i'm really looking forward getting impact level 4 i ordered same time this one , because level 2 fantastic . this sports bra offers support , style . i've worn it jogging three times it feels great . no bounce no pinching . it held up great washing machine dried really quickly . everything i've tried before this wonderful bra way too flimsy offered no support . years i've looking something would hold everything place while i ran few miles jogged up down few sets stairs . i think i'll get one each support level then i'll get one more each . it even adjustable hooks elastic band around chest , so you lose those lbs while wearing this great top , you'll able adjust it fit you you slim down . i'll never search high low again . i'll know exactly where turn whenever i need sports bra support my " needs " . thank you figleaves , you really great product . i hope enough women find these sports bras godsend we'll never wear ugly , cumbersome , pinching nightmares again	1

i love these shoes ... but i heck time finding pair fit . i debated buying pair online because reviews so mixed . then i saw them dillards better selection colors , same price ( no shipping fees ) . i wear size 9 must tried 5 pairs before i found 9 fit like glove . within selection i choosing , there variation within sizes ( some 9s half size too big , some just right ) . reviewer zappos said these shoes better molded your feet if you warm them up dryer minute or two then put them	-1
i love my regular crocs ( they my staple shoe summer ) but they're too informal workdays . my fiance got me this prima style holidays they quickly become my favorite shoes . they lightweight comfortable crocs , also breathable . yet they cute regular ballet flats . i'm going buy pair silver . other reviewers complaining poor fit -- i wouldn't buy these shoes online unless you tried them store first , but if you buy them try them home before going out so you return them if they don't fit . you can't expect every single shoe manufacturor adhere exact same dimensions .	1
this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1

negative reviews aside - mostly because they stray good common sense any semblance sense humor - this pretty eye-catching bracelet . it conversation starter , but mostly it way me say something myself rather innocuous way . i recently broke one given me friend . i wore it daily liked sentiment . if you can't enjoy life - why bother living it ? then again - if you aren't enjoying life , you really living ? " livewrong " doesn't take anything away good work many doing - nor it fall into category all pseudo-charities who jumping band wagon . it what it - funny idea probably given guy who came up it fairly good side income . good him . i replacing mine - well buying few friends . what amazing how few books review sections this long . perhaps two words simply easier most people digest opinion	1

bought these boots here amazon because fabulous bargain price , i not disapppointed . they look absolutely marvelous , so comfy , like wearing big , soft bedroom slipper . they very warm also waterproof , so they withstand most any kind weather . i almost always wear 8 boots , but these , 8 way too large . this boot run little roomy . so , i got 7.5 am very happy it . one caveat : these not lightweight boots . pair weighs little over 3 lbs . which slightly heavy side long walks , but i don't plan walking miles them . looks weather protection , they can't beat . picture , foot looks slimmer , but they wide-foot look mukluk style . still , cute fake fur tops make them very stylish . also , suede straps around boot looks only -- don't try tightening them . i've heard several cases where people tried tighten them they broke	1
i really like these boots- they're cute good quality , heel isn't too high . unfortunately they're way too big me . i usually wear 8 or 8.5 , there no 8 available , so i ordered 8.5 . they're too big i'm returning them . otherwise i would've very happy	-1

these shoes comfortable first moment i put them . there never break period . i normally wear 6.5 shoe , these felt little big when i first tried them . however , when i tried size 6 shoe , i knew too small . i ended up buying 6.5 . i just wasn't used shoe fits allows me enough toe room wiggle my toes . merrells great people who need little more room toebox , but who don't feet wide enough move wider shoe . these shoes not waterproof , so you need treat them if you plan hiking through wet weather . i recommend purchase insoles after you worn these shoes few months . insole they come rather thin doesn't offer whole lot support . overall , if given choice , i would happily buy these shoes again . i would also say they run true size most people .	1

this not your typical lunch bag , several reasons . this bag very large accomodating all your needs , male or female . it indeed very roomy i would classify it daybag or travelbag because it isn't limited most " lunchbags " , but still great days office . those you troubled coworkers " borrowing " your food drinks company refrigerator , your troubles over this bag . tons room include cooling packs keep least long day worth food drinks chilly . top bag seperate section hold all your other daily needs , whether it reading material , including full size magazines you won't roll up or fit , medications , keys , cell phone , pdas what you . other compartments accomodate you further . conveniently , there compartments where you keep things hidden , so personal items or valuables don't displayed any time , unless you choose so . this bag appears really well made , nothing cheap it or ill planned . zipper pulls alone tell story , large , heavy solid , accomodating smaller hand all way up very large men hands . stitching appears very well not prone come apart easily . dual handles top allow carrying one hand , or clip adjustable strap more hands free tote . thickness insulation more than adequate , much thicker than most off shelf type insualted bags , it what you would expect premium bag . fabric quality denier looks like it able hold up heavy use easy wipe clean , like most denier . i would not surprised see flight crew carrying this insulated tote , it style simple elegance you usually see their carryons , suitable even daybag phobic male , but sleek enough woman feel though she hasn't just joined brown bagger construction crew . this bag doesn't look out place office or worksite , beauty classic neutral design causual person or professional . it enough capacity work picnic bag several people . my mother eyeing it use carry all her copious amounts makeup her trip vegas , keeping all it cool mind . plot didn't succeed , it not yet seen vegas , but nice try mom , lol . sticker shock this bag may seem high if you used throw away bags mass retailers , but this worthwhile investment those needing quality more space . overall value very high more than worth money . hey , just what coworkers swipe month time might pay whole bag itself .	1

i 43 years hiking , backpacking peak bagging experience . recent years i migrated , like most people , all-leather european-style mountain boots lighter fabric/leather combination boots . they seemed work well while but two years ago i started experiencing significant pain my toes , instep heel . i concluded my lightweight boots well known outdoor supplier contributing factor , if not root problem because they didn't provide sufficient torsional ( side-to-side ) rigidity . danner advertisement " terra force " boot support system convinced me buy radical gtx two years ago . first thing i liked radicals roomy box toe area eliminated occasional rubbing problems caused my prior boots ' smaller toe box . there also plenty instep space my high arch . unlike many boots now come single width radical multiple widths allow wider fit ball foot while retaining snug heel fit prevents blisters . terra force torsional support not diminished after 250+ miles hiking . besides day hikes 2-3 day backpacks i've used radicals good results off-trail scrambles summits high sierra north cascades , occasionally crossing snow steep enough require ice axe . despite offering much more support than my prior lightweight boots radicals hardly heavier ( my size 10.5 -ee weigh 52 ounces ) . best all , after switching radicals my toe instep problems ceased almost immediately , my heel problems gradually diminished substantially , all which i attribute superior support terra force system . my opinion these boots too many seams different pieces leather fabric , but i'm not marking down my rating because that how virtually all lightweight , relatively inexpensive boots made these days	1

perhaps it my own fault not reading more closely , or failing question somewhat ambiguous product description . fact , i thought i would receiving 84 plastic stays ( 3x28 ) , 28 each 3 different sizes . $8.00 , seemed like reasonable deal plastic collar stays . what i got , i confess product description could interpreted this way , total 28 stays assorted sizes . when you add $4.00 i charged shipping ( actual us postal service postage package $1.84 ) , this really poor deal compared other available options . 43 cents each plastic collar stay ? bad choice	-1
swim suit so unsatisfactory looking i didn't even try it . it blue striped totally different blue strap didn't go main color suit . very poor choice grab bag . taught me not use grab bag shopping this company	-1
these body suits awful ! when i first saw them i really relieved i found something would good summer months . i put them my twins after first wash velcro closure scraped up insides their delicate little legs ! suits appropriate size washed according label . i am so disappointed angry . it waste my money .	-1

look closely picture " white " top . it actually red around top straps . those us who don't want ugly red zig-zag thread .......	-1
paid double what i found site outside amazon/this store - never again	-1
quality terrible , undersized or seconds . later i saw same product discount warehouse 1/3 this price . i would not recommend these anyonei paid waiting 6 weeks my credit . amazon must protect buyers better or lots business go elsewhere . it only when problems arist true color marketing company comes surface . i am disgusted this product	-1
material good , but suit runs way too small . i ordered appropriate size based my measurements , but all my wobbly bits poking out . i don't think i could wear this out public ! not curvy women !	-1

other reviewer spot . these pretty ( but not truly mirrored ) they broke after only 4 weeks use . i bought pair aviators gas station made much sturdier materials half price . definitely not worth $16	-1
2 bras i ordered they same style , it even said so labels attached , however , they both look feel different . white lot more padding , rounder shape , lining tearing away padding ( part design ) . navy bra more pointed shape less padding ( which what i wanted first place ) i also disappointed sparse stock ... addition , i wait extra 2 weeks one bras come because ordering screen i not informed it would backordered . not happy my overall experience	-1
these gift christmas , deep burgundy color . they appear well stitched . however , after no more than 2 hand washings cold water color showed alot fading , 3rd wash i knew they would returned color fading uneven tops adn bottoms almost don't look like match anymore . silk soft lovely but color should not fade this fast or this much !	-1

i am vey unhappy sales professional nautica outlet stores . i very bad experience nautica store outlet stores . customer service representatives very rude unprofessional . they basically said they don't really care if they lose one customer , other customers still buy .

this cap definitely not cute picture . loose threads it . looked cheaply made this bought gift . i wouldn't recommend this item . it definitely cost more than it worth	-1
slip slippers-no hands required-these not pass test . small lip back more harm than good . i ordered 1/2 size large it not enough . if you high arches go 1 1/2 sizes larger or look elsewhere . synthetic upper more sweaty than comfortable	-1
per description , it sounded like these would fit snug . well , they fit too snug , feeling very cramped . i 33 inch waist , ordered 32/34 waist . i'm used boxer briefs made cotton . this first time i've got polyester boxer briefs . unless you like ' um really tight , you might want go next size up , or just get cotton briefs . i'm throwing these away	-1
scarf arrived several holes it . my daughter very dissappointed , crying wondering why santa sent this her . we ordered well advance before christmas but set arrived too late . we never notified there would delay shipping . few days before christmas it arrived ! it too late anything . amazon should improve quality control vendors before it allows them list their site .	-1

i bought this birthday gift my husband , while i wasn't expecting best quality world ( because price ) , i still little disappointed . company wonderful job packaging/shipping product-even buttons individually protected . i paid expedited shipping , but they still cut deadline close , so i nervous it arriving time . lining inside thick bulky so it isn't streamlined pic implies , tends make leather bulge bit places . ( it lumpy-looking even box . ) removing zip-out lining doesn't change this--there significant padding shoulders . it also shinier leather than expected . sizing chart seems bit inaccurate -- i ordered size larger than he normally wears coats ( which size larger than his regular clothing ) , but it still too snug places , lining or not . overall , though , i'd say i got what i paid , if you don't count unusually high shipping charges . ( even standard shipping handling charges unusually high compared other companies .	-1
product would great , but store these came sent wrong sizes not respond my emails what exchange them correct sizes . i requested xl long pants . they sent size 3x pants . so they completely unusable , not respond my emails . i would never order them again	-1

i never wanted write one these , but i feel i . i bought these boots , they great , but one size too big . so i tried exchange them . amazon doesn't exchanges ..... apparently too difficult . top this , price doubled after i bought them , so now if i want boots , amazon not honor previous price . this something any dime store would , but apparently one world largest online retailers couldn't . this very disappointing , i would never recomend this company anyone .... ever .... quite opposite	-1
i bought this watch rei . first one electronics gave it up first night when i connected it pc . second two plastic housing started separating . that right , i return watch three times , 3rd time i just wanted my money back . also , it seems you hold your wrist up facing sky if you want reading . too bad , watch sounded so good ..	-1

" sling " misnomer this gimmick ... think " tourniquet " you'll closer reality . there several buttons eyes " sling " adjust fit . i tried every configuration , they all felt too tight . snug fit would more tolerable if thing stayed put , but my experience same other reviewers : noose slipped off after hour or so walking around . despite problems strap , i like briefs . my recommendation buy briefs sans strap . sling technology needs more rd before it ready big time	-1

theory this boot seemed perfect : added some height , came perfectly wearable colors , made real leather , price unbeatable , but ( yes , unfortunately big but)like everything else which seems perfect , it perfectly flawed . i my research , read reviews ordered boot half size bigger than my usual . but still super tight across ankle top my feet , totally crushing my veins . i'm big " shoe collector " i recognize design error when i see one . surprisingly it came this brand , usually so quality-reliable . these boots not meant walking . if you want take pretty picture them , they might fulfill purpose	-1

i agree what others said re-designed sport knit pants . i happily buying tapered-leg cotton sport knit pants least dozen years when lands end decided start making them wide straight leg instead , presumably because some customers requested newer look . maybe i'm wrong , but i think most people who looking latest fashion aren't going suddenly start shopping lands end . it seems me if few customers requesting new style , company should make new , additional product style , rather than re-design product which , according lands end own descriptions , perennial customer favorite . i returned new pants this formerly loyal lands end customer now shopping elsewhere	-1

i am great shape . however , i cannot get over so many men underwear products waist bands constrict exasperarate blood flow muscle tension . obviously they made china where average waist 25 inches . idea " medium " marketed ridiculous healthy american standards . my body fat low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . common men my age , lower back problems not unusual . i 32 " waist . not " medium " sized ? i think we simply need get rid elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all doesn't work it dangerous those many us fight our lower back problems . draw string fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems fashion , anyway . just give us option pulling shorts back up instead pinching nerves static elastic waist band causes ridiculous lower back problems because unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers don't hold up well any kind washing . they looked like crap after first time i washed them . i wish i could get refund because i won't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like " old men " underwear . sad embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash light dry . i am not mean hearted kind guy . so , i am going shut my mouth now not business you again .	-1

like photo implies , like most 2(x)ist men products , this underwear sexy , comfortable , flattering made quality materials . believe me , this trunk truly pouch . big one . its actually just right size me , i am sure you no problem fitting it/filling it . lines around it simply call more attention your more prized areas , so its really nice . course , pouch this size because general loss material elsewhere trunk make this " no-show . " i no problem this no show , wearing my lowest-rising jeans it . basically this underwear meant fully appreciated when you not wearing your pants :) me , this trunk not uncomfortable , given its diminished size intent no-show . granted , those moments excitement , things get little more - eh , crowded . but pleasant side effect it look herculean size if you only your underwear . i not experience much more discomfort than i any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk . this pair made 100% cotton , so those you who not appreciate synthetic materials x-factor line may enjoy this feature . my only complaint leg openings not " cling " me stongly waistband since they not made elastic or nylon , etc . but just minor . waistband , always , remarkably soft material mix more discreet height , keeping no-show design . may i suggest you go extra-bold 2(x)ist no show trunk 3133c , which comes contrasting colors - same product , same price , just sexier ! i cannot reccommend this trunk enough , within hours , it became my favorite 2(x)ist product my collection	1

... not mention great pair sunglasses great price ! initially there problem my order but lu 80s purple very helpful once contact made things settled timely orderly fashion . i very impressed customer service end always important when dealing seller or vendor after initial purchase made . glasses great . though thought some " 80 " " retro " or what you , aviator sunglasses like chuck taylor converse shoes , like cowboy hats , like your favorite solid color t-shirt . its americana , classic , cool , which what makes it buck trend stand test time . i love my new shades . they also come great hard-case so you stow them anywhere not worry them getting damaged . beyond even , why pay over 100 dollars pair " name brand " sunglasses made plastic when you get something sturdier , more durable metal frames ? even beyond , uv rating these actually not any lower than anything else i've ever worn , solidifying fact not only you getting what you pay here , but if your not buying here paying more elsewhere , you most likely wasting your money . i very impressed professionalism kindness showed me customer support . thanks 80s purple	1

these silk pajamas , my opinion , much higher quality stitching , tailoring details , well heavier weight silk than closely priced dreamsacks pajamas . sizing help : help clarify sizing people ( there conflicting reviews here ) , i ordered medium but then returned it . i probably get some minor alterations , but i don't blame company ... everyone shaped differently . i am 6'0 " weigh 175 . my suit measurements 42 " chest , 34 " sleeves , 32 " pants inseam . medium body fit but sleeves pants too short . large best fit overall , although roomier around chest than i would prefer . but if you my size large your best option .	1

i usually search high low this brand , but it always well worth it . these undershirts made extremely soft cotton just slightly thinner than your average undershirt hanes or likes . cotton amazing - these shirts seem last forever , after three washes they feel like they made mold your body . i don't know what different them , but unlike cheaper tee , they come fit you perfectly rather than just hanging flat down your sides like so many other undershirts . if you haven't worn these before , you don't know what you're missing out . comfortable fit means your underarms don't sweat all because material fits you perfectly rather than gaping open under your arms . i really can't describe what difference these shirts make my day-to-day comfor t.t he only complaint i they slightly hard come -- so once you're hooked you'll always want few extras hand . highly recommended	1

i abolutely love these pants ! i own four pairs already , i am currently order 4 more pairs . they run very big .... i am usually size 9/10 , size small fits me perfectly ( if you want snug fit ) , medium fine too if you want them baggy ( three my pairs med , which ride really low hip me , my waist 30 " my hips 40 " , i said size small nice snug fit , but still comfy , not uncomfortably tight ) . 8 pockets great ! they so versatile , you wear them work ( if you semi-casual environment ) , they look great button down shirt or cute little babydoll top , but they also great anything athletic you might ( i rollerblade ride bike pretty frequently these my favorite pants wear ) . drawstring waist perfect so you don't need belt drawstrings ankle perfect tie them up knee if you want makeshift capri . i love these pants	1

my search perfect gym bag like my search perfect hair drying , yoga mat , organizing products , garlic press ( zyliss ) etc . fortunately , my search perfect gym bag officially over . ogio locker bag brilliant inventor should get some sort award . k.r.t. seeley review sums it up pretty well , but here few things add . one thing , shoe area also nicely accommodates hair dryer or curling iron . one reasons this matters it points up critical advantage shelf separating shoe area upper part bag : while shelf sturdy , it also adjustable . it goes only low enough allow pair shoes , but it also raised allow other items . next , while it very nice front end panel all these handy little pockets things like shampoo , brush , whatnot , actually including containers fit pockets shows real consideration their users . plus number outside pockets , several which not only zippered but waterproof well , , say , wet bathing suits . before i bought this bag , i called my gym yes , i really make them go measure width their lockers . magic number 12 " . 8 " , ogio bag fits room spare . raqueteers ( sports , not crime ) , there several loops one end panels holding racquets couple others i haven't quite figured out yet . yogis yoginis , yes , adjustable strap end panel accommodate yoga mat , if it not too thick . outer side pocket nicely accomodates my workout journal ( yes , i'm fanatical record keeper ) , well my beloved newgrips ( just search newgrip ) which indispensable rowing ( notoriously hard hands ) weight-lifting ( billion other things those us carpal tunnel , arthritis , or , my case , both ) . outside pocket perfect cd player headphones . only improvement i imagine this bag would adjustable straps bottom hold larger , rolled towels or mats . unfortunately , even title9 doesn't seem carry one anymore . other words , this bag best market . it bit pricey but it worth absolutely every cent . i suspect quite lot my friends getting ogio christmas birthdays whatnot . congrats , ogio , thank you very , very much	1

i almost didn't order these ear muffs based some other reviews , but i'm really glad i . if you're looking simple ear muff , these it they great deal only 5.69 . one other reviewers commented they poor quality too thin . they thin because they made thinsulate ! if you want something bulky , i guess you should order product not made thinsulate .	1
luv them , but order 1 size smaller - they run big - i wear true w-6 but they too big . size w-5 fit great . you might go kids crocs . they should tell you item description so you order correctly . besides , i would give them 5 . i no idea why they sized so wrong . if you order your true size you return them one full size smaller proper fit	1

adidas three types shoes their " ride " shock absorption running shoes ; gigaride , megaride , this - microride . microride outsole consists smaller sized absorption grooves ( aka nike shox lookalike ) . gigarides megarides emphasize shock absorption . microride more concerned weight , it seems like . there also two models microride , one full fabric top , synthetic leather construction . this one full fabric , which supposed soft , also lighter . ( synthetic leather supposed more durable . ) anyway , combination microride full mesh top , this shoe low very light . i can't find number anywhere , but once started running , shoes feel like featherweight . impact little bit harder , due less shock absorption , so it probably more treadmill shoe than trails . overall , though , very comfortable . it my first time running shoes this light i like it . these , i achieved my fastest pace ever less effort than i would expected . couple things i notice : size narrow/small side ( compared my nikes ) , back heel support bit hard/tall my liking . white version gets dirty quickly . running good , but walking wet road experienced slight slippage . also , workmanship leaves bit desired	1
this perfect little summer shoe !! great ked quality fashionable design !	1

i'm 16 years old normally i wear boxers , nothing else . recently i purchased 8 pack these briefs excercising because i thought i ought give briefs try after 6 years . first , it bit strange , but i quickly came enjoy feel this style underwear . they don't bunch up or give you " wedgies " like boxers because their looseness center-seam design . they provide support your male stuff stay place throughout day . people tend believe briefs " too tight , " hence term tighty whiteys . if they're too tight , you bought them too small . simple . these briefs perfect wearing any time any situation . i thought i might feel self conscious while wearing them , but comfort them overshadows any . if anything , i'm proud . overall , i recommend you give these briefs shot , no matter what underwear you tend prefer . however , despite pre-shrunk they shrink up bit after initial wash . i'm 32 boxers , but 34 these works out great	1

my hubby loves these boxers , they something he wanted childhood . only slight downside them i recommend you either hand wash them or delicate setting your washer	1
though i prefer flannel cotton boxers , i needed silk boxers long hiking camping trip . ( silk great moisture-wicking quick-drying properties . ) under nylon shorts , intimo silks managed keep my special fun area reasonably dry even while hiking driving rain . when they get wet , they dried much , much faster than cotton boxers . they lasted couple months before falling apart - pretty good show durability , actually , given amount punishment they took . i only two pair i alternated them , often full week washings . obviously they got kinda crusty , but couldn't helped . under circumstances they held up well . i would recommend them . this boxer/brief/thong controversy , i believe man should wear whatever type underwear he finds most comfortable . if means boxers , fine . if it means thong , fine . what women consider stylish should very bottom man list concerns . women consider all kinds ridiculous things stylish , such hairless pets , square-toed shoes , pointy-toed shoes , monochromatic look music andrea bocelli	1
i just got this dress it adorable . you wear it dress or shirt jeans or leggins . it easy dress up or down . great buy money . extremely flattering comfortable	1
other reviews note , these pants incredibly soft , comfortable , very flattering fit . i absolutely love them . they fantastic wearing during yoga , pilates , cardio machines , low impact or toning activities . however , please aware more vigorous rapid your movements , pants may not hold up inside seams ( i wore them during high impact class lots very deep lunges kicks , inner thigh seams seemed like some stitching little frayed end class ) . so save these wonderful pants low impact activities enjoy truly great product make you feel great wearing them	1

bravado maternity/nursing bra very comfortable daytime wear , so i would highly recommend it if what you looking . way which bra opens closes makes it very easy comfortable , it doesn't create strange lines under your clothes like some nursing bras . after first few weeks wearing this bra , i no doubt i made right purchase . downside , others mentioned their reviews , i notice time went bra seemed somewhat less supportive . same lines , this bra bothered me wear bed , because my breasts always seem fall out it . i know i wearing correct size , so maybe this due low-cut criss cross shape bra . whatever reason , i found it quite irritating uncomfortable wrestle my breasts middle night !! fair , i same problem another(different brand)nursing bra also , so maybe this just what happens when you try sleep bras . consequently , i ended up buying sports type bra sleeping . overall , because i only used this bra daytime wear i resigned myself fact i'd wear breast pads almost any nursing bra , i really liked bravado bra would definitely recommend it .	1
i've jumped rope 7+ years cardio just purchased my 4th pair these . i cheap plastic one weighted rope ( this everlast leather weighted ) . plastic one costs only few dollars i use if i'm traveling more than couple days , sometimes mix it up . weighted rope good cardio workout which also tones your upper arm extremely well . this my 4th pair because others eventually cracked through , which happens when it drops repeatedly against floor bad angle . one them also just wore out center where there alot friction floor . i tried plastic handled brand , but cracked around same area well , even sooner . this classic , fully recommend . it didn't receive 5 stars only because it needs replaced every couple years . but then again so all others . highly recommended	1

hi y'all! when my wife became pregnant , she worried she would constantly expand her wardrobe our wonderful growing child expanded her belly ( yeah , i know babies grow uteruses , but " belly " just sounds so much cozier ) . these baby mine maternity belly bands allowed her wear her normal pants skirts waists undone all way up her sixth month . after our child born , my wife no more use bands , but i didn't want see them go waste . i always pretty trim , but i wondered if baby mine maternity belly bands might work growing beer belly well growing baby belly , so i began eat drink excessively , allowing my belly grow . my wife thought i idiotic , but i told her she her turn , so she should let me mine . after gaining fifteen pounds noticeable paunch , waists my pants no longer buttoned comfortably . i undid my pants , wrapped my belly one baby mine maternity belly bands , threw old oxford shirt . after buttoning just top few buttons oxford , i looked if i wearing particularly snug , extra-long , patterned t-shirt underneath . i went my local watering hole none guys recognized i wearing article my wife clothing ! i now become big fan baby mine maternity belly bands , bought additional bands add my wife collection . well , i suppose i should say " my " collection since i'm one wearing them . if my wife becomes pregnant again , i , course , share bands her . who would thought my wife pregnancy my frugality would result sharing clothing me my beloved ? i joke her my " child " due any day now , then rub my belly lovingly . my wife gives me strange look , sighs , then just shakes her head . i know she just jealous , so i tell her , " hey , all you become pregnant again if you want wear these baby mine maternity belly bands . " " i don't know if your fathering child such good idea , " she replies . i ask her what she means , but she just shakes her head says , " never mind .	1

how you not like these . comfortable , durable great bargain	1
enjoyed isotoner slippers many years , i sorely disappointed when they changed their sizing/fit several years ago . package sizing remained same , however , they decided " scrimp " fabric . consequently , newly purchased slippers , though well within my known size range , ( supposedly through 10 1/2 ) still ran short toe ( i wear 10 ) , thus far less comfortable . i sure ... you bet . i still ancient pair when i slip , excellent fit . no stores carried sizes beyond xl ... until i saw these amazon . i ordered them xxl they really fit . re-ordered 2 more pair each my daughters ( who've same problem ) . i give 4 stars i've found their overall quality not quite what it used ... but least they fit	1
i've wearing these slippers years they've become increasingly hard find stores so i'm grateful amazon finding them me	1
just note say this t-shirt some good things going it . it size it says it . medium really medium not really large . printing held up well wash fabric isn't chintzy so there no see-through going . i would reccommend this shirt	1
i ordered dress it came very quickly . it here less than week . it looked exactly like picture came all accessories it suppose . i'm mine altered because it inch too big up top . dress easy alter . it also very easy either attach spagetti straps or use scarf make straps attach dress . if you're uncomfortable strapless dress . there so many different things you this dress it great . it great dress great price	1
like all 2(x)ist underwear i own , this brief made superior materials appears built last . it certainly well worth price i paid . if you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply not want flash your waistband any reason , then this brief you . period . those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or like , then you not need this , but you still very well may want it . clearly this brief meant two things ( 1 ) make it so you wear very low-rise pants ( 2 ) make it so you look irresistable when you not wearing your low-rise pants . i found even though underwear cotton - opposed synthetics x-factor line , example , this brief still conforms my body contours pretty well . actually very well everywhere except it bunches little where it meets very inside my thigh . regardless , this going show off everything you got , subsequently make it look ( more-or-less ) more impressive . practical consideration : pouch area above reduced size since it accomodating very low-rise . translation : cautious when you get aroused there not great deal " expansion room " . enough said , but why i gave this pair 4/5 stars . everything else great . i never problem my rear exposed these briefs . if you forsee this problem you , then may i suggest 2(x)ist contrast countour pouch brief 3103c ? it same price ( review time ) same materials but standard cut features sexy contrast lines . i own it well you may read my review it its product page	1

although levi 505 jean usually referred zipper version classic button fly 501 , levi 512 model seems closer me . if you looking 501 fit without hassle buttons , this may way go . 505 rather full seat crotch ( technically " rise " ) look pretty baggy . though described " slim fit " , 512 more moderate fit , snug but not formfitting , much like handsome 501 . rather than slim fit , it really should described 512 " tapered leg " , because it pretty strong taper ankle , which means it not fit over boots , unlike 505 501 . only real downside this jean comes only one finish , rather milquetoast medium stonewash . over time , however , it breaks pretty nicely looks good .	1
but i expected lot less price . all pockets clips everything really cool , it even two way zipper . while im wearing this thing , i feel like i am ready defend freedom . excellent shipping speed	1

review : charger sync adapter brick can't fully engage player because leather straps , so it easily disengaged slightest movement . slightest movement ? i dont think so . no adapter doesn't fit jack well when it this case but it fit . if your going buy car charger your zen i would suggest you buy one you don't need adapter it , plus it charges faster , just like wall charger . i only use adapter home . headphone jack lines up fine . review : fold-over flap isn't designed well . first all , it gets way headphone jack , so many times when i opened flap , it pulled my headphones out headphone jack . part headphones beyond me . you put headphones jack two ways . you completely close case , foldover flap then put headphones , like when youre not going changing songs alot . i this when i am working out gym . second way headphones inserted case but fold over flap/screen protector , open . i this my car so if i want change song while driving buttons right there . i never headphones pull out jack ive it over three months i wear it everyday ymca . then theres .... finally , this real deal breaker , fact you cannot plug adapter bottom player when case . you pull player out every time you want sync or charge you player , which big hassle . this also not true . i didnt think it would fit right either when i got this mail . but it fit . you just can't button case closed . i use adapter or my wall charger(which same size port my zen , thank god ) while this case my zen . then ... case small player . when i tryed put player case it tight fit , when i finally got it case bottom buttons player pushed down case . this case also adds lot bulk player well very uncomfortable use . don't listen anybody who thinks this product great , they lying . case seem tight but thats how you should want it . you don't want your zen shaking around case you ? this case not press buttons down . it take some getting used because you press harder get buttons . but scroll pad right there open so you don't worry . i this case since i bought my zen . i bought it ebay 10 bucks . yes it seem add some bulk zen but i like it . ive dropped it twice all ready while this case there no damage . it actually seems some shock absorbtion due its studriness/thickness . people whining beltclip .... only time i put zen case my pocket gym . i put it my pocket clip outside my shorts . i am upside down when i decline bench press upside down when i situps , it never fallen out or even seemed like it going slide out my pocket . if you care your zen like i this probably best case get it . best ive seen anyway . dont go them cheap rubber/plastic covers(you know which ones i am talking ) . also inside cover/flap there " secret " slot where you put money or id even . its sweet yes ? high five ! people seem knit-picking this thing alot reviews i've read . buy this case , learn how use it before you get here roast it all right ? ive it long i my zen it great no matter what you doing .	1
i love it ! it exactly what i mind . there silicone skin complete cover plastic shell front . shell covers display there cut out click wheel covered silicone skin . system comes three silicone skins ( " clear " , black , glow dark)and one shell . there option belt clip ( i don't use)that works well too . bottom open both connections . hold button top little tough get if your finger nails very short however . there adapter well ipod dock . me this perfect case	1
this comes 3 silicone sleeves one transparent hard cover ( used either sleeve ) . keeps ipod protected while maintaining it slim profile . click wheel works well even under through silicone . package also comes special iskin dock adapter so you dock/charge your ipod without remove case - extremely convenient . only con i've found so far it difficult move hold button silicone sleeve ... but it fairly minor my opinion	1
these boots sized very oddly . my guess they 1 1.5 sizes smaller than they say . my size 7.5 mom got these gorgeous size 9 boots she loving them , so not bad purchase over all	1
i like color these jeans , since it nice dark without unflattering areas fading like some other jeans . fit good length long you don't dry them dryer . my only gripe they stretch out pretty quickly get saggy . other than , they're great	1
these boyshorts wonderful . they good quality very cute . sizes run small , so i go up size or two when purchasing them , but after doing so they provide snug comfortable fit .	1
i got sick wearing 100% cotton white undershirts , because they would continue shrink deform indefinitely . so i tried these 50/50 shirts they've trick	1
i'm very happy this bra , great buy price . it very comfortable , gives nice smooth push-up , it seems very good quality . it great wearing sexier clothing you don't want your straps showing or you want alittle extra oomph . i'll probably buy more different colors	1
my poor son got deprived backpacks bookbags because homeschooled , but now he college student , he carry books ! this means 5 star rating might biased sheer pleasure simply something feel like fitting crowd , but fair honest this product ... i admit it look like quality item . it built practical , looks good , ( guess ) i'd say it probably better suited college use rather than high school . some odd reason college doesn't require many books carried one day i see what high school students carry . if this bag dual set each bag opposite sides , it would seem resemble old-fashioned saddle bags ( except it not leather , maybe little bit larger capacity , plenty individual compartments zippers ) .	1
fast shipping a+ seller . pretty good but zip lock bags work same . bags huge though	1
i love these boots ! i wanted style look ugg without breaking bank . my feet stay dry warm cold michigan winters , but i also feel fashioable . i get compliments my bearpaw boots wherever i go	1
i wearing bearpaw boots three years or so ... they warm , cute , incredibly comfortable . i first bought them when i moved backeast . never lived where it snowed , i very worried cold but not blow hundreds dollars uggs . i happened find bearpaws local shoe store bought pair , wow ! coldest days i could wear ' em ( without socks , which good , because i hate socks ) toasty could . they last forever , too , easy clean . yay , bearpaw	1

these cutest shoes really sexy - they little snug my toes , but hey , these heels - you cannot tennis-shoe comfort fit tall , sexy heel . just compromise girl gotta make sometime ! wonderful value overall	1
somebody else noted , it keeps everything thier place . goes good tight jeans . comfortable while sitting	1
these very soft comfortable . plus because their boy-short shape they don't show panty lines . also they don't " ride-up " like allot boy-shorts	1
i ordered this jacket this size based sizing chart provided . when it arrived , it not even close size stated . i contacted customer service assured i would not charged shipping both ways . however , my refund notice arrived today i charged $10 shipping . it would cheaper just keep it ebay it	-1
edited add ( 2/13/07 ): i washed my jacket first time it still looks perfect ! i think it shrank just tiny bit , which only made it fit better ! ------------------------------------------------------------------------- if i give this jacket 100 stars i would ! i yet wear it ( arrived today , tried it ) i love it ! it perfect weight texas winter would transition well into spring ... my only regret ( like everyone else who reviewed it ) i not buy one each color ! i monitor amazon prices almost every 2 hours so hopefully i'll able buy couple more when prices drop ! jacket definitely great quality -- nicely lined not smell or stink , sign high-quality tanning process . ( i'm wearing non-washable suede jacket cost 4 times more it reeks tannins . ugh . ) caveat , though : i not go amazon sizing chart . i searched all over web live little/ami size charts nordstrom it . go chart instead amazon perfect fit ! those who hesitated last time , when this baby drops price again , go it ! well worth money , well worth time well worth monitoring amazon hourly	1
i purchased this item my daughter christmas very pleased . it shipped time it not big blizzard co christmas time , she would it plenty time . she loves jersey , too - good quality looks just like " authentic " jerseys much more money	1
we purchased these items online before very happy them . they reasonably price look feel very good when wearing them . i highly recommend these camisoles	1
this bag great people who need lot organizing space their gym stuff . lots pockets , yoga mat holder great , bottle holder fits all standard sized gym water bottles . only con if it not filled , bag tends fall itself	1
i am sort workout junkie , more specific , " firm " workout junkie . i like how intense firm , i sort look workouts i . now this workout good , not intense transfirmer workouts just out . don't get me wrong : i 6lb ball , you use it 90% workout . end , i definately ready put it down , so it work me out . pros : different change pace using ball ; lots moves strengthen your core ; fun different stretch end using ball ; tina smalley precise leader easy follow . cons : i miss old firm master instructors all other videos . just allie allison this one . they didn't even introduce others . there no changes weight , which used way spot " ineffective workout " according " old " firm tapes . lastly , my humble opinion , ball little gimicky . good 5lb weight held dumbell ends would work same . still worth giving it shot different days . you'll sweat , but you'll wonder , " this really firm ?	1
very happy these , they're very comfortable - two colors each . pleased transaction	1
i ordered this my wife we both very happy product ! beginning we weren't sure how one size fit all . my wife 5'6 " 125lbs . we took risk , it paid off . both pieces fit perfectly , we back more . good bye , victoria secret lingerie	1

bag perfect if you looking computer bag , however there not much room anything else . i expecting it little bigger , but it great bag otherwise	1
i just recieved my bag i love it . bag arrived 4 days after i ordered it . bag fit my laptop perfectly . first i hesitant since description states " fits most 15 " laptops . " i dell inspiron e1505 , it fits just nice . there still plenty room my 5 subject notebook cell battery charger/mouse . material nylon handles very sturdy . i also like it zips top . padding inside also nice . i would definitly recommend this product someone looking style ( looks more like purse ) also durability .	1
i looking this kind tie tack very long time becasue it great . i helps you keep your tie down while still able see whole tie	1
i say this works perfectly serves its purpose better than stupid-looking tie bar ( unless you're security guard or used-car salesman or something , i don't think you want tie bar showing ) . one caveat if you don't line up tie perfectly tiedown , it bunch up bit , but i don't think there really any way they could've designed around . you just adjust length little make it work if happens	1
very tight sexy but comfortable great wear . love it , like it red	1
i found pajama set very nice quality received them short order . thank	1
this very good quality funtional mask . i use this under full face helmet cold weather motorcycle riding . priced right . velcro adjustable . long enough cover neck area	1
levi usually my choice brand jeans pants . so when levi introduced this new fit , slim straight , i purchased pair tried it out . 514 very large range sizes trendy washes , usually sale very reasonable price $30 . i recommend this fit thin men , tall or short , who i think look best . men who aren't comfortable wearing tight jeans shouldn't purchase this fit , because it certainly figure revealing . it slimmer around thigh , unlike skinny 511 jeans , where it much tighter around both calf thigh . waist low rise , which i find very comfortable while wearing , leg opening straight cut . 514 shrinks slightly when washed dried . i personally think this fit better looking than skinny 511 , which i believe just fad now . skinny sort tapered-mom-jean look it , i don't think anyone agree guy looks good ! i suggest you try these jeans out before buying them , see how you like them . me , i like them so much , i think i'll purchasing pair future	1
tired sad , slightly smelly mats gym , i set out find yoga mat would inspire me put time ... even when i busy ! success ! just normal thickness , but cushier mats tend make me feel slightly unsupported . grooves provide good solid grip your feet , though it little slick first , after i washed it used it while it became nice sticky . but above all , reason you probably considering this mat rather than cheap(er ) one ... beautiful pattern . i selected blue one , i've gotten so many compliments . more importantly , it makes me enjoy my workout even more . ah , kicker - pattern isn't just surface ( other reviewer pointed out ) , but continues through entire mat , so you can't wear it away use . certainly recommended	1
besides service or quality product , service provider it great , due some reason first attempt sending it fails , so provider send me e-mail confirm if i received item , soon i let him know i didn't , he not wait anything he sent one immediately , so i appreciate his gesture professionalism . thank you	1

i small microfiber ameribag , i highly recommend it . carrying this bag not going eliminate your back problems , or make it feel like you carrying nothing all your back . but , small bag great because it forces you downsize basic items you need carry ( instead bringing backpack full things ) . beauty bag design you place it variety positions your back/shoulder , based where you feeling back pain . pockets inside very thoughtfully-designed ; there seem just right pockets everything . i carry this work each day instead purse . i also use it day trips --- it easily holds wallet , digital camera , phone , travel umbrella , even small sweater	1

this 3rd travel clothesline me ; not because previous ones broke but because i keep finding clothelines offer better features . this best one so far since it eliminates need clothespins , better holding wet , heavy clothes clothes don't slide . my only complaint i wish it suction cups clips ends like my other travel clotheslines so i could hang it bath/shower or attach it poles . my previous clotheslines those features i used them alot . work around this i use small carabiner each end . this travel clothesline would perfect if it offered all those features .	1

i am so happy i got these bands ! when i first noticed my clothes weren't fitting anymore ( around 11 weeks ) , i went maternity clothes shopping completely discouraged lack clothes early pregnancy . when i got my bella bands , i automatically felt better myself ! so far , they four fabulous functions life-saver : 1 . make shorter , non-maternity shirts appear longer so you wear them longer2 . allow you wear non-maternity pants button undone - even jeans ! 3 . hold bands maternity pants up so you wear those earlier . 4 . keep everything tucked supported so you feel more confident less flabby . so far , i'm wearing them tucked over once , but i'm sure later my pregnancy i expand them full size they'll added comfort peace mind . every newly pregnant woman needs get these month 3 !!	1
i am so happy my bella band bundle purchase , so happy i bought pack 3 . i hesitant spend money these but after searching net this similar products figured i'd give it try . buy these early ladies ! i waited until my 24th week buy bands today slipped pair pants i haven't worn 2 months , unbuttoned unzipped even , but nobody could tell bella band . look cute layered not bunchy . nice material even felt great under my shirt no more belly button ' hole ' showing!i'm going up my ' skinny clothes ' box pull out items i wear my bella band . i'm so excited use this now post-pregnancy . ps - they even came nice surprise bag skittles , heaven me	1
this shirt one kind . it only dark navy shirt large chicago bears logo it i could find . it little large me , but looked great first time i wore it . however , after just one wash , some logo started peeling off ! i can't imagine what this shirt look like after next season , probably just navy long sleeve shirt ... buy this shirt caution	-1

these really good boots . i am definitely glad , however , i read reviews before i bought them ordered half size bigger , or they would extremely tight . they actually even bit tight even bigger size , but they stretched quite comfortable . only thing annoys me bit they tighter calf than any other boots i purchased . i solve only zipping them up 3/4 way . otherwise , i am happy them . i didn't think i would like rounded toe much square , but gotten use it like it	1

i dont understand why people complaining this dress . first all i went american apparel store style meant " trendy " aka bottom cut it wasnt sewn together . so dont blame andrew " quality " . if you paid $9 dress dont expect designer stuff . its basic t-shirt dress , it looks cute , it small side , edges cut but not finished , you get what you pay !!	1

pros : great cushioning / support ! simple design , not too flashy . very breathable , allowing plenty air circulation around your foot . cons : not really comfortable . they seem really wrap around your foot , which fine if you go out run ; but walking / everyday life , you can't really let your feet ' rest ' . i minor chafing ( back foot ) after first run them	1

my 2 1/2 year old son almost heartattack when ups man finally brought these door . he so excited he could barely breathe . when he opened box put them immediately he not take them off . he loves how they light up . velcro elastic makes them super easy take off . i would recommend buying size larger than what you think your child would wear because i think they run little small .	1
very soft , beautiful cozy . i wear these everyday . only thing would make it " 5 star " product if it more supportive , cushy sole . sole hard stiff . but i still like them lot	1

i don't think this ugly bra , just plain , plain , plain , which what i looking . bra sleek doesn't show though . shaped cups give beautiful silouette . it feel more substantial , but not like body armor . honestly , it wonderful support i need without feeling like i'm wearing " old lady " underwear . low rise lets me wear scoop neck tops . i some frustration over figuring out correct size . i wear 34ddd wacoal , but 36f le mystere .	1

hanes makes excellent white traditional brief gentlemen amongst us who just don't want wear boxers . relatively snug fit ensures these briefs not " bunch up " like loose fitting boxers so often ; many men prefer these briefs reason alone . briefs easy care ; they essentially permanent press so any washer dryer set clean them well . they seem last forever , too , which makes them excellent value . if you , try get these without tag rear so you won't get itch caused tag . however , even tag you usually don't feel any discomfort . i've worn ' em way years without problem . 100% cotton fibers these briefs add comfort you'll feel , too . my only real caution -- main reason this product gets four stars instead five -- these briefs tight first several times you wear them . this may true some us men even if hanes claim these briefs preshrunk before they hit store shelves . i personally would suggest washing them once or twice just loosen fit up ever so slightly . relatively minor concern elasticity waistband eventually wear out . point you need buy new briefs -- but , then again , nothing lasts forever , right ? overall , gentlemen who want close fitting brief still gives them comfort very satisfied these white men briefs . three pack gives you value they last long time .	1

this case ( barely ) hold my 5.1 mp sony cybershot digital camera large zippered pouch . small zippered pouch nicely configured holding extras like batteries , extra memory sticks , etc , padded pouch webbed rear wall velcro secure webbing -- giving two practical accessory sections . belt loop well made , strong , well secured , doesn't velcro or snaps ( which i hate , since i fear losing camera way ) , so this thing stay your belt , worry free . zippers appear strong , don't bind or act sticky . it feels light fits comfortably my side or back via my belt . it reasonably attractive such bags go , especailly low price . display cardboard it came mounted ( i bought mine discount store ) said it lifetime warranty , it looks like it made long life mind ) . padding appears sufficient all around resist normal bumps , etc . ( though i would fear drop concrete ) . i actually bought this hold my tiny memory stick based mp3 player , related accessories ( i already similar bag my camera ) . when my creative muvo player el-cheapo case came player cracked badly i feared it breaking completely , i wanted cheap , durable , reasonably sized case . i really wasn't able find anything made such player . then i looked small camera bags , figuring if i could pop earbuds winder couple extra batteries , i set . now this what i carry my mp3 player . it easy carry 1 5 extra aaa batteries player earbuds winder . player stays dry , padded , secure . very versatile zipper ( two zippered tabs leave any zipper hole where you want , big or small you want ) large pouch makes it perfect let earbud cord peek out without fear any rain getting . i think if you small digital camera or small mp3 player , care more functionality , durability , very reasonable price than latest fashion fad -- you can't go wrong here . only three ( small ) drawbacks tiny mp3 player use i see : 1 ) . i used piece bubble wrap pad player large pouch . it actually bit big small pouch , would flop around lot big pouch . 2 ) . course , you can't get player controls when it secured this case . this doesn't bother me i generally just turn it , adjust volume circumstances , pick music i want , close pouch , enjoy my music . if however , you want fiddle player controls lot , you won't like this solution . 3 ) . instead custom-made hole headphone/earbud cord , you need use zipper gap described above . i see no practical harm , fact it makes where " virtual hole " goes extremely versatile . however , it may fashion " disaster " ( which i couldn't care less , personally ) .	1

gold toe makes excellent sock their " men canterbury dress sock " no exception . socks remarkably comfortable . they not thick ; although they bit thinner than other gold toe socks they still withstand lots wear . they almost never " bunch up " inside my shoes i walk around they very much worth price . they last longer so long life these socks justifies slightly higher price . i also like design toe section actually gold colored fabric . amazon points out these socks come your choice four different colors : black , navy blue , grey marl brown . safest , most conservative choice corporate office black color ; but other colors come handy too depending your work/play " dress code . " these socks easily washed any washer or dryer -- but i would heed manufacturer warning not drying them high temperature . high temperatures clothes dryer cause sock wear out faster . stretch nylon stretch even more ; then these socks become just too loose your feet . please note these crew length socks . they not come up your leg degree some other socks . you may consider them " too short . " other hand , socks also fit shoe sizes 7 through 12 so it almost one size fits all . overall , gold toe brand buy if you want good quality , long lasting socks . " canterbury dress socks " men match any attire they even worn bed those really cold nights keep your feet warm ! highly recommended ! may you wear them good health ! smile	1

i looking small bag would hopefully only carry essentials , plus book ( regular sized paperback , not " little webster " ) . ideally , i want one would carry essentials ( id , plastic , cash , cell , sunglasses , pen notepad ) well book water bottle , but i just shooting most my desires . this little bag holds my essentials just dandy , but it just shy carrying paperback me . so , most part i hardly use second large zippered pocket . velcroed cell phone pocket roomy my flip-phone , but not too roomy . next pen holder small zippered pocket , which runs deep behind pen cell phone pockets -ample space notepad . front main zippered compartment holds small zippered pocket inside great cash cards . shoulder strap removable , there straps back looping through belt or whatnot . i never found it necessary , but you may find it useful . while it wasn't quite what i hoping , it good bag all-in-all . oh , fair warning -the bag absolutely stank when it arrived . blame it chemicals fabrics treated , but you want toss it wash when you get it . it survives it just fine .	1

i this bag little over year , i love it . ok , some stuff you need know ...... this bag charge your cellphone , ipod , pda , camera , aa aaa batteries ( ipod batteries require purchase seperate adaptors . you find them [ ... ]) i think it takes 6-8 hours charge nothing using sun , but you confirm above website . it also adaptor charge battery home or car . this backpack not charge your laptop . space provided solar collection isn't big enough . there seperate solar arrays you purchase fold up go backpack ( i've seen them $200 ) . upside backpack you don't stationary it collecting power , unlike folding arrays . i wear mine while walking around chicago , or cycling work school . bag isn't much heavier than " non-solar " bag . infact , once i put all my school books it , i couldn't tell difference weight this one my old bag . even cold chicago winter , i get charge relatively clear day . ( i.e. it doesn't hot outside , just sunny . ) also , aware this bag battery stores power you collect until you're ready use it , some other manufactures no battery , which means you sun when you want charge something . i didn't purchase my bag through amazon , ( though i must say i'm thrilled they carrying it now . ) i dealt directly voltaic systems , their customer service point . i hope this review helpful you	1
i purchased these tights store(for like [ ... ] bucks ) . i like them , they thick but not not hot or itchy . great part they not roll down top you cant see like my little girl underwear comming out side leotard tights . my little girl 3 years old , she not really tall but she inch taller than all other children . so i got small ( worker store told me it would fit ) , sizes run like this : toddler 2t-4t 34 " -40 " small 4-6 40 " -46 " intermediate 6x-7 46 " -51 " medium 8-10 51 " -55 " large 12-14 55 " -60 " over all it good , only reason why i not vote it 5 star because i only used them once but next week we using them again . so if you looking ballet tights buy online because price good !!! unless you got different source	1
this kavu bag fabulous . it great diaper bag , go bag , purse , going hike or picnic . any mother or woman go , i would recommend this bag	1
overall these shoes fit fairly well , stylish appearance , price right . only concern i they seem run little short length ( odd nb ) . i buying nb shoes long i remember , this first time my toes obviously very end toe box . they look good though , provide great arch support new balance famous . it always good idea try shoes before you buy them , but online price so seductive , it difficult pass up " deal " . if possible , try find some your local shoe store before you purchase these , pictures don't show you all angles this shoe , parts trim ( my opinion ) " goofy " looking . overall , i'd recommend these shoes walking/jogging/going gym . if you want some serious running shoes , spring higher-end asics , nb , saucony , etc .	1

i am 48f i tried many sports bras my day . this best one market large breasts . no bounce . it feel little restrictive first , but once you used bra it great . best sports involve running , walking , or any kind bounce . not very good sports require intricate upper body movements like yoga	1
this bra great , especially larger woman . when i use this bra i don't move or bounce all . before i use two bras ( even when using one champions best ) . i purchased one ( because they pricey ) , but soon after purchased because i didn't want use anything else . this well worth money .	1
ok , so oprah recommended this bra - you might heard . ( particularly if you visit enell website . ) but there very good reason . sports bra , this bra completely perfect - it eye hooks all way up front , while you may feel bit first like you're wearing chest girdle , i honestly say i've never enjoyed high-impact activities ( running , aerobics ) much i now - precisely because it so uncomfortable past . bra feel tight first , particularly around ribs - but trust me , if you get right size yourself , you follow their instructions putting it , you'll amazed what you comfortably	1

i got this bag black , it exactly what i looking mesh tote . however , i give it 4 stars because although price only $13.98 , shipping $10.98 !!! i purchased it anyway because bag priced lower than anywhere else i shopped , which made final cost acceptable . granted , i receive it one business day ; however , i believe shipping cost excessive item weighing 1 pound shipped within same state .	1
there " possible " defect m1122 model . i wanted post my experience here case others this same problem . after wearing m1122 shoe only few months , my pair started producing very strong odor . smell not inside but outer backside , specifically area consisting encap material which , according new balance , polyurethane plastic . smell gradually got worse , so bad fact , i keep them my garage smell like mildew/urine odor . i don't own pets , nor i gotten anything sprayed it . smell didn't suddenly occur either , it gradually became more intense over few weeks . washing shoes washer wouldn't get smell out so i returned them new balance store late december 2006 , they replaced it new pair . up until this past week ( late march 2007 ) , new pair great , but now they started putting off very same odor , again , not inside shoe , but coming areas shoe encap material featured . i decided call new balance directly informed them problem . they told me they fact other complaints people all commenting odd odor coming m1122 model shoe . nb requested pair sent them testing . if you experienced this problem your m1122 ( or other models ) , contact new balance customer support via their website . ** regards comfort i give this shoe five star , but regards problem above , i would give it zero star . common ground , i it two stars but based problem i experienced now two pairs exact same shoe	-1

i just bought two more action shape bras , i compelled write how much i love them ... little over 10 years ago , my sister turned me them . genetically , we're predisposed big bustlines , which its advantages disadvantages - one latter trying find bras fit support still look good . i've tried many , many other sports bras ( trying find one $20 range works ) none other compare - racerback types don't give me enough support - other ' high compression ' bras create oh-so-unattractive ' uniboob ' look ; underwire sports bras very short life - they're pain keep washed it doesn't take long underwire pop out underarm area ( ouch - always seemed happen during heavy workout ! ) , et cetera . champion action shape takes care all . there enough separation where this looks fine even wearing under shirt ( i've even able wear this bra under blouse or sweater if i'm planning going horseback riding after work ) . straps fasteners totally adjustable . bra mostly cotton , there might some lycra or polyester there but i'm cotton freak - no itchiness , no seams chafe , best all no underwire ! it totally supportive - i mentioned , i ride horseback ( this trumps popular rider " no bounce bra " sells over $50 ton hooks - like corset - ugh ) , am also gym rat , doing high-impact aerobics , weight training , spinning , pilates yoga - this bra eminently suitable all those activities . care easy - just toss it washer dryer or air dry ( i generally airdry hooks tendency get caught ' holes ' dryer ) . they look good . i just wear this top its own . btw champion come out new color this year - champion red . i just got it it looks awesome ! highly recommended	1
fit this bra flattering , clips easy enough fasten unfasten . however , inner cup slightly cuts into your skin , which lead itchiness after wearing it all day . i am still trying out nursing bras , so this i don't many compare this . however , it best fit i found so far nursing bra , especially if you well endowed	1
these tank tops very good quality . they soft very minimum shrinking , if all . they not fit very tight but they not baggy either like many others where you might buy size smaller . very comfortable wear . i plan purchase some more	1
this stuff good when you go you just want listen your music w/out hold it or anything . i would choose this over anything .	1
this product arrived time works terrific . couldn't find silicone case anywhere town -- only one place car charger it $30 itself . this whole package great deal . case really protects gigabeat	1
this clutch looks so expensive so many different slots money , credit cards , change . i originally bought it go dress but returned dress kept clutch . it looks like real alligator skin though i love fact its faux . everyone tells me how nice it . i don't know why person reviewed it poor quality it fell apart because it so durable i've it month it still looks brand new !!! hopefully you make purchase . enjoy !!	1
i am addicted my pair kobo iii women plan buying multiple pairs next summer . perfect beach or pool or gardening or running errands , these shoes one-piece construction plenty drainage wet conditions . they light pack easily , come very reasonable price . best all , these shoes wide . i wide feet , big wide ugly feet , but i rarely buy wide because heel such shoes too loose me . end result ? i'm limited boxy styles pricey european makers ( ecco , dansko , etc ) i buy medium width -- generally one one-and-a-half sizes bigger than my foot measures . kobo iii , i could fit my actual size . i haven't since i teenager . i wish i'd known these shoes when i pregnant my feet got even wider ! my only complaint they obviously casual sport shoe -- no real way dress them up make them go everything .	1
go it . your goggles may fog up , though . if so , use medical tape just top part your skin prevent air escaping upper part up your goggles . i tried them very cold still ok . if it gets too warm , you bring nose part lower your chin . perfect use wit hemet . good price too	1
we bought both this brand soffe artiga compare . we like artiga more far somewhat silkier look feel , but they run tad small you may want order size larger than you usually wear . soffe also excellent quality , but more vein true cotton t-shirt runs true size	1
not only they make me look frumpy , stretchy belly portion these pants start 3 inches higher than pubic bone , which makes them pull very tight when sitting down , especially later months pregnancy . they fit fine 5 or 6 months , but 9 months denim too tight lower abdomen section . i end up taking them off something more comfortable immediately when i get home .	-1
my perspective , it perfect gift little girl wants just like mommy . your daughter won't mess your purse anymore - she'll busy her own . bought it 2 my nieces they both love it	1

forewarned ! never mind all mellifluous flubdrub nature-formed last , footwear classic , nineteen sixty-five , etc . facts matter ( ) irish factory where wallabees handmade love closed down late 1990s ; ( ) product made mainland china since time ; ( ) materials workmanship don't begin come close their former standards , which duly reflected downward price shift ($180 1998 but $110 2006 , inflation notwithstanding ); yet ( ) web sites -- which claim shoe " even better " -- seem no problem posting photos no-longer-available irish craftsewns while shipping chinese hack jobs . very , very disappointing , gentlemen . ( i once found fellow ottawa who bought up considerable quantities sand suede wallabees selling them premium -- $225 -- i happy pay , but even he ultimately went out business , just like peter , my custom birkenstock sandalmaker germany . ) i once phoned vendor complain , some imbecile tried explain me product " better than ever . " i flew into rage , telling her what she could her lies . i also chastised her brass-bound gall lie me , diehard wallabee fan who continuously owned ( worn , day day out ) several pairs -- sand suede , oakwood suede , brown leather , and/or black leather -- since age fifteen , two-thirds lifetime ago ! ( oakwood [= dark brown ] suede always my favorites , since sand suede always looked little too smart-alecky me , making me look [ quite accurately ! ] like upper-middle-class new york city jewish boy -- just mate them sergio valente jeans , creamy velour shirt , ultra-expensive sweater . ) all vented , wallabee still reasonably comfortable shoe -- assuming you find two members pair actually match within reasonable margin deviation ! teenage kids won't know difference , but baby-boomers moved tears . get program buy either pair those ultra-advanced , computer-designed , ruggedized flip-flops ( there scores vendors ) or some quality suede sneakers ( leather ones far too oppressive educated foot ) . caveat emptor !	-1

before carhartt goes way l.l. bean , fox racing inc ., timberland ( barney new york matter ) stock up great , genuinely tough , useful , comfortable , attractive clothing like these shorts -- everything else carhartt makes . these clothes make you feel look good ( " comfort clothes " you might say ) while you're rolling around dirt or even your living room floor . i laude previous reviewer honesty saying they're great wearing without underwear hot weather , because they really , really . jeans / denim most cotton cloth get hot , real uncomfortable particularly man ' bait tackle;' whereas this cloth breathes exceptionally well . they're particularly great after doing endurance sports taking shower -- when you're body still all reved up -- loose , comfortable cool-down clothing you're fine wearing rest day . pockets loops also very handy , not only working car , bike , or doing construction , but also plenty big enough carry your cell phone ( even my treo ) , keys , wallet comfortably without like those huge , ugly military-style thigh pockets . i expect carhartt might someday start marketing itself just like other great , functional brands went hip-hop style or suburb/country sheik , if they it real loss . but now least we enjoy long series brands became famous function before it popularized suburban teenager fashion then ruined .	1
i wearing these around house 2 days test comfort fit . they very comfortable cute too ! they bit stiff out box but i able bend stoop better than i would thought when i first put them . they also surprisingly lightweight warm winter boots . they true my size 9 womens foot . only negative i come up shaft big laces don't help tightening them up . i small legs though i not tuck my pants into them either . if you bigger calves or want tuck your jeans or snowpants you'll fine . my jeans fit over top just fine . i would wear long sock keep them rubbing my legs	1

if you new new balance 99x line then you wont notice these shoes stiffer than 991 . 991 cadillac running shoes , your could wear them all day suffer very little fatigue . 992 stiffer sole overall quality shoe seems like it last longer . 991 some cheaper plastic parts liked crack fall off . 991 pros ; comfortable , better running shoe , cheaper992 pros ; not quite comfortable but still better than most , last longer , looks more stylishfor those you trying choose these brand , remember these shoes made usa not sweat shop workers country . they both hold up very well over long run compared other brands .	1
i looking long time several features this micro-fleece offers . first all inner sleeves nylon lining makes it easy slip off without static bunching up your shirt sleeves most others result . density fleece top notch , not weak thin stuff you see way often . it usual required adjustable draw cords . i think more people would attracted it if picture displayed solid colors ( black ) i think two tone combinations look cheesy . --- try it!you'll like it !	1

i ditched bulky jewel cases my cds long time ago favor nice binders would hold disk artwork securely without taking up too much space . since my collection continues grow much faster than i anticipated , i recently started looking buy more binders . alas , ones i already ( no boundaries , wal-mart all places ) don't seem available anymore , so pretty exhaustive search online options brought me this item . basically , this binder pretty much everything i looking : three ring construction , sturdy zipper closure keep discs safe contained , sewn-in handle back so it portable . plus this particular model rings slightly oversized stated capacity , so there possibiity expanding buying more sheets . i bought three , they work great . i buy more - several more , because they best option there present . let me tell you , however , what i don't like them . first , cover some sort plastic or vinyl . i see this cracking or disintigrating couple years , even gentle treatment . second , there isn't proper spine binder : it basically single , flexible sheet wraps around outside but doesn't make square corners . means it look untidy shelf also makes me question its long-term durability . third , sleeves : they too tight put disc artwork same slot , ones closest rings their corners notched accomodate rings , slits oriented zipper side instead top . those drawbacks aside , i plan buy more these . they best choice available now , but i wouldn't hesitate ditch them if something better became available . if you looking safe , flexible , smart place store lot cds , this item should top your list .	1

what great jacket this ( i've got it stone ): simple , casually elegant ( i guess also depends who wears it ... ) , seems stain-resistant ( i received many visits dirty , muddy tiny shoes nothing shows ! ) , absolutely water-resistant ( i clumsily sprayed myself water while handling garden hose nothing went through , it dried up quite quickly ) . sure , i could used extra-pocket inside , but hey , 40 bucks ..	1

case arrived looking good it pictures . i thought it looked stylish/retro . i read other reviews there scratches caused mainly space above click wheel below screen . i checked stitching before placing my 30gb video ipod . stitchings around border soft . but when i felt stitchings around click wheel hole i see why there alot complaints ipod scratching around there . sitchings bit more rough aound click wheel than it around screen . but other reviews i read , there no scratches long term use case . but i nothing worry because i kept plastic adhesive sheet came ipod . so i suggest those who want cautious , try buying adhesive protective sheet if you dont it or you could just wrap your ipod saran wrap . after just taking my ipod out it left some sticky residue back , ugh , took me forever rub it off edges but it still left some residue . sides base there lining glue ... figures . but its still good case . guess you just fully cover your ipod front back before putting it	1
i bought this my 30 gb generation 5 ipod , after doing tons comparison i love it . those who worried showing off design ipod this not you , but people who deathly afraid dropping ipod or scratching it , this it . clickwheel very accessible ports . it won't fit dock , but if you don't dock it stay when connected your computer just wire . i also love look it . it looks like wallet . one note , if you interested hanging this belt loop back strap , it functional but bit awkward . snap velcro safe enough keep it , but it always seems wrong position fiddle . i am very happy this purchase	1

bra really comfortable easy use . material soft breathable it looks good under clothing . only problem shoulder straps extremely short cause some ride up . i am not long through shoulder area so any normal length strap would more than sufficient me . this would 5-stars if they would lengthen those straps . i medela bra different style it same problem	1
i never one wear something other than baseball hat longest time . finally i started branching out looking different clothing styles . something said " me " but didn't put me into any specific category . i found hats bailey wool-felt hat . its comfortable because its material , you don't baby it like some hats . if something smashes it down , it easily reformed back its original shape . hats style alone not say cowboy or retired yuppie , but more practicality it represents adventurer or even just " average joe " class . its working mans hat wear town , or city mans hat wear while relaxing stream after day fly fishing . make sure check sizing chart if you ordering online ( i use my baseball caps , which sizing mark inside tag , reference ) otherwise it might best try one store make sure it fits . i like way they various sizes encompass different exact measurements , way no matter what , you'll find size you looking . i only say this because baseball caps i've trouble finding cap i like pro back ( non adjustable ) size i need . i found drawstring nice addition but not something i really needed there never high winds whenever i'm wearing mine . nice change pace statement simple style , bailey wool-felt hat affordable , durable , classic	1

this great pair underwear . it very soft against your skin . it doesn't feel like most thongs ride up you or give you major wedgie . they comfortable enough worn all day . there enough waist these it won't obvious you wearing thong if your pants droop . enjoy minimal back coverage provided while maintaining comfort this underwear it holds you nicely place	1
reviewer below hit it head . if you want your boys ride comfort all day long , want not even notice your underwear all day long ... believe me thong lot less annoying than either boxer briefs or especially briefs . , yeah , wife likes me em too , but real bonus all-day comfort . guys ... you'd better try these things . try all kinds , but this one near top my list . lots room no binding . go slowly ... buy one thong time make sure it fits before buying moe same kind ! some fight tight ... others loose	1

i several pairs vf panties they all among my favourites . material lace band panties not quite so silky or sheer lace nouveau which my all time favourite , but they probably prove more durable . time tell . i like little lace my panties it adds interest classic look . this lace waist band though rather narrow tends roll over become invisible . i owned panties wider lace band quite liked effect . rear seem nice it tends define my rear cleavage . sum up . good value panties but they usually get passed over when i'm dressing special event . i might wear them beach see what others think	1

perfect . what you say perfect ? seams sewn well , elastic stitched properly , fabric very comfy against skin . nothing bites you anywhere . fabric seems thicker crotch area needed . color doesn't fade washing . they shrink when washed first time , but this allowed sizing . order your correct size they seem bit loose before they washed , after they fit exactly size chart . i'm getting 6 pair i like them so much , i wish jockey matching sleep bra	1

pretty much two things make people recognize me ... my headbands hoodies . both which adidas always match . white/black adidas sweatshirt = white/black head-band . red/white sweatshirt = red/white head-band , orange/white hoodie , orange/white head-band , etc . etc . etc . first it out practicality ... exercising , etc . but head-band , well , story behind i too cheap buy new set head-phones djing , speaker left side broke off , leaving it lose . great djing , but remnant plastic rather uncomfortable right behind your ear . so ... i headband one day i got keep using my old rag-tag headphones i loved so much ( i've since stopped so cheap got new set ) . why adidas hoodies - they're just so incredibly soft comfortable ! i like them more than nike ones , then i think they're just bit more stylish . this though great sweatshirt . very warm , very soft , pretty cool clors . i cream/red colored one wear it loads - even though there isn't matching head-band it yet . drawstring good , pocket big ... what more you ask ? bit expensive , which shame because you know it $20 tj maxx next winter . but still , i like mine .	1

i like use aqua shoes houseslippers , but they ususally black rubber soles leave ugly marks floors . i took chance ordering cudas hydrosox hoping reasonable quality fit non-marring no-slip soles . that what i got . these pretty sturdy , they fit better than any several other brands i've . they're extremely comfortable , they look good . soles durable -- almost-clear latex composition , very nonslip , totally non-marring . these sturdy enough use when driving . i wear them short errrands -- coffeeshop , supermarket , etc . i say 4-stars ( not 5 only because nothing perfect ! ) , whereas i'd rate all other brands i've tried no better than 3-stars	1

these my first pair gauchos , i'm always leery buying new fashion or brand over internet ( what if they're poorly made , or don't fit me right ... returning hassle ) , but i've got say , i am delighted this buy . i'm 5'4 , they hit just right point my calves , although if i much shorter , i might think they too long . i athletic build , but large hips , i worried these might make me look huge , but they very flattering my body type ( i also friend who pair quite slim - size 2- they work beautifully her too ) . they ultra comfy just right amount stretch . because they mostly polyester , they aren't really breathable , but they so lightweight , it not factor me . they also virtually wrinkle-proof . if you're looking buy gauchos , or just comfy pair hip pants hit town , i would definately recommend these	1

purse size true dimensions listed , but lining not quality i expected . explanation " water-resistant " nylon opposed silk lining it made it more practical backpack , however , this bag obviously not designed backpack . leather high quality you wouldn't want exposing it elements any significant length time , much less trying put anything larger than paperback interior . i really like versitality various pockets pouches , including interior wallet , magnetic snaps hold everything together pretty well . it remarkably light , even all my stuff it . color appearance shown here true actual product . i like fact wallet top zippered partition , so you easy access your cards , cash , etc , without dig around . all pockets zippers snaps extra security . we'll see how it holds up over time !	1

i initially clicked infamous " live wrong " bracelet because i thought it something my 26 year old son would think funny fun wear . i've probably only read three reviews all time i've shopping amazon . i don't remember why i started read these reviews but once i i hooked . i am 52 years old , fat but not stupid moron . i've lost 4 people i love cancer . i am cancer surviver . i think these bracelets exactly what they supposed , funny . i believe they personal statement , every other colored band sold . what i think wierd uproar this caused both sides . truly offensive people those who feel they judge person any bracelet , hat or car . while i drive my suv i wear no bracelets any color . i taken advice d.l. hereford . ray " conspiracy theory " send my chairitable contributions direct . i contribute time well money what i believe time slipping bracelet off doesn't count . i daughter-in-law who relay walks other fund raising activities while she wears her yellow bracelet . i think she considers bracelet less important than rest . i think silent bob would approve . brent freakin ' wilson , your anger over this way overboard . i sense other personal issues . see your pastor . emperor ice cream needs write book , maybe he could call it , i'm smart , see . or perhaps geraldo type talk-show would work better . then he could allow people view his impressive intelligence first hand . lovestory 27 , quite reading romances grow up . way , there t-shirts money going charitible causes , too . why allow evil doers put live wrong shirt ? doesn't anyone realize this amazon.com not political forum ? all bands , black , yellow , pink or aquamarine more club membership cards than anything else , don't make them more important than they . i'm buying some !!! i joined this damn thing , i am officially over edge .	1

i first attracted these shoes because their cheerful color . secondly , i attracted general style these shoes , which when worn long pants gives appearance pump without flying my foot like pumps . crowning feature this pair its five inch heel . therefore , style color , i would give this shoe five stars . unfortunately , i disappointed way shoe balanced . it required lot more concentration walk than most five inch heels . this due its very thin stiletto heel . also , it rather painful . albeit , most five inch heels very painful . therefore , i would not recommend wearing these shoes extended periods time , nor slick surfaces . luckily , clasp top shoes not dig into my leg , i expected it would . overall , i would give these shoes three star rating far comfort concerned . i ordered items this seller numerous times very pleased them . they ship quickly their items always good quality . i highly recommend them . - ravenov	1

i bought pair black . they fit perfectly soooo comfy . bottom shoe zigzag so it flexes easily like you're not wearing shoes . i gave it four stars cuz i cut off tassel since it looks like worms hanging off your shoe ( which real easy ) bottom shoe not completely covered rubber , part it suede so you can't wear it near water . otherwise very comfy cute	1
i've wearing this shoe several months now , my only complaint it very wide shoe . so wide , you'd think it unisex sizing . problem footbed itself . even though you cinch upper shoe secure your foot , you can't cinch it up so your foot can't slide sideways inside it . otherwise , it easy on/off , secure tread -- never slipped dock yet . it would fine women w/wide feet who would ordinarily buy men athletic shoe . also seems very durable	1
i just got these sneaks recently . i am going through wear-in phase shoes . so these opinions based soley , no pun intended , my time them so far . originally i gotten pair jordan hoops low . i loved style got good deal them . well , i found out 13 jordan more like 11 or 12 other shoes . so i them returned 14 . i got 14 they long enough .. just not wide enough . it then i found out most jordan b-ball shoes pretty thin width . i told guy i am willing look what they store just get something i try . i ended up trying kg a3 they felt nice . i tried these t-mac 6s next they feel better than kgs overall . kgs felt better heel , but only place . everywhere else , t-macs more comfortable it perfect width . just shoe ... they hurting my feet just bit .. but common me break period . i am overweight flat footed so it takes while me get my shoes comfortable . they also warm inside . i am just wearing normal cotton socks right now , not my new jordan dri-fit socks which wick better . i notice there no ventilation holes shoe like most . none toe area .. none tongue .. none sides . there also no meshy fabric help ventilation either . one thing i worry " stability system " bottom shoe . long term .. it seems like it would like shox system . my local shoe expert says he gets many returns shox torn or worn shox part prematurely but never any t-macs back yet . i guess we see	1

if you're anything like me you're losing shades almost quickly you buy them . i've hooked wayfarers style since blue brothers 80 equivalent new kids block , but price prohibitive . there cheap knock-offs out there low prices , but quality shows cloudy eyepiece dull plastic earpieces . not so oc shade classic wayfarer sunglasses . quality virtually indistinguishable similar brand name styles many times price . i so pleased my initial purchase i've laid small supply these sunglasses , stocking up both smoke/black tortoise combinations . some people complained glasses smaller similar big name brands - not so . i've uploaded picture oc shades compared similar big name brand cost me over $100 - i defy you tell difference ( well - if you know where look obscured logo , you figure it out ! ) but , other than - there no difference . i advise you buy many pairs these glasses you people your household who wear ( lose ) classically styled great looking shades . preferably before oc shades realizes they're sitting gold mine raises prices	1

i'm not one hyperbole , so when i say " best shoes ever " i really mean it . definitely best shoe purchase i ever made . these far most expensive shoes any kind i ever bought , they totally worth every penny . fact i bought second pair this same model because first one so good . normally i'd get five pairs running shoes price these two . ( i'd love get these deep discount , but just haven't found them anywhere . ) they take lot wear tear . i run walked well over 1,000 miles these shoes they still practically like new , just little worn center front sole . which doubly amazing considering i weigh over 250 pounds . usually i blow out pair shoes after just 300 or 400 miles . aside slightly warm they amazingly comfortable . i wear them all day work , or fifteen-mile walk , not any discomfort . fit perfect , usually that problem area me . these snug without binding , all right support right places . no appreciable wear occurred interior lining shoe . brooks very good brand me , these far away best their line i tried . compared best stuff new balance , asics , saucony , mizuno other good brands i used , beast completely different level	1

when i first got these shoes mail put them my 1 year old heard them first time i thought i going return them immediately because they annoyed heck out me ! day happened my childs first birthday party so i decided keep them him day return them later ... first i say he never laughed so much before what he would when he would walk them hear them squeak-he loved them ! second , everyone his birthday party ( we big family church family too ) loved them-all other mothers wanted know where i got them how they could buy their kid some ! admittedly they incredibly cute ( i bought usa red ones , my child seem love them ... plus i always know where he ! needles say , after day i decided keep them now they've grown me though i wouldn't recommend them if you or your child can't tolerate constant noise because these suckers squeak every time your child moves	1

these only jeans fit my figure i love long length , too ! i've tried every single brand mid-priced jeans i so happy when they fit . unlike most jeans i've tried , these don't gape too much back . sizes run big so try size or two smaller than you normally wear . i would say these jeans good women who : ) tall , ) above-average hip-waist ratio , ) booty , ) like stretch comfort	1
we've this carrier 7-8 months only used it go hiking - our intended purpose - handful times . we used go backpacking lot our childless days i would not say this carrier quite comfortable pack i used ( gregory ) * but * then again my gregory pack always just ridden quietly my back doesn't throw its weight around yell my ear . i think wiggle cargo accounts difference comfort , difference not big . still , i never hiked more than 6 miles my kid this i can't imagine going much further than . i'm willing admit this due more my going soft than poor pack design , though . we fit all his diaper supplies attached backpack if we use disposables , tie few toys off loops carrier , stuff sippie cup holder back , it makes nicely contained baby unit day hike . what i found this pack unexpectedly great use place stroller where strollers hinderence - such historical sites - or walking around mall or grocery store . my kid reached this point where he hates ride shopping cart tries climb out , but some reason he happy clam riding up high my back this pack . generally happier than when stroller , even . never fights get down . my husband i both use this pack comfortably . i am 5'4 use pack second smallest setting ; he 5'10 uses it maybe 2 settings bigger . i think there 8 settings all so this could certainly work well wide range people . kid perspective , my boy 30 pounds , 35 or 36 inches , he riding seat middle ( 3 ) adjustment . only thing i don't like it sunshade/rainhood , which included this model but makes this model more expensive than next model down , which i think called journey . we just never use it because it wigs my kid out so we should saved money . i also looked rei child carriers , baby trend , lower priced kelty ( base camp , i think ? ) suspension just didn't compare . pathfinder line just much , much more comfortable . i don't even understand why kelty puts out carriers like base camp . my only regret not gotten frame carrier sooner . i overestimated which point he'd ready one	1

i understand other reviewers cups larger would trouble getting this off , it pretty snug over head arms even hooks undone -- but this full-b-cup , it perfect . no bouncing , no sliding up out under bust , nice smooth look under t-shirts tank tops . i worried elastic bands would chafe scratch , but bra stays place so well it perfectly comfortable .

i bought two different sizes this product . i initially bought large since size chart says 175lb person ; they should large - extra large brief . not true !!! size felt like regular underwear ! luckily i tried medium size found it provided much better support slimming . i not drop dress size , but i definitely look slimmer neater my clothes since no rolls bulges show through . they also very comfortable wear extended periods	1

i am very disappointed this product . quality extremely poor -within week 2 buttons fell off , 3 loose . seams shoulders back crooked , hem . there already holes pockets . wool very poor quality weave started pill soon i wore it first time . what worse , i don't even wear this coat every day - i only imagine what it would like if i wore it regular basis . this jacket waste money	-1

category push up/suspensor boxers these clearly best . they work advertised : lifts gives you great profile both front back addition they very comfortable wear . but i two advices : 1 . one size larger than you normally use . 2 . buy white or black . i bought " mint green " pair which turned out girly , light blue color - certainly not color advertised	1
no reason even try different boot . i several pair these over years you just can't beat them comfort durability . they fit perfect right out box . i got really good price these-have paid much $120 same pair previous years	1
i choose 3-6 months size looks like 9 months size . too big	1

shirt fits well , good style , good shirt . but bealls florida sucks retailer . their customer service rude , crude , unrefined . even supervisors customer service suck , they don't return or accept any items back . so beware , you better damn sure size fits ( ordered product before ) . because bealls florida not let you return item different size or style . i not shop here again ! i repeat , i not shop here again . this place sucks far retailer	-1

i loved bathing suit first time i laid eyes it so i purchased it . i'm actually small but i thick thighs so i got medium . but when it delivered i tried it , it too small ! i should gotten large . medium made me look like i these big love handles . so please whatever your size make sure you get it size bigger . but other than bathing suit great . i'm just going loose love handles	1
shoe comfortable but description says off white or white beige . which leads you think color mostly white . true color neither ! there absolutely no white these shoes . i purchased these shoes because i needed some white off/white shoes not beige shoes . no i not return them it too much hassel return things so i kept them i worn them once but not like color all . style not cute her others but they still great bargain . materials excellent quality . if you like beige earthtones you like these shoes	1

i got this bra thinking it would great rigorous sports my 38ddd chest . think again . go enell sports bra . i bought size 3 it perfect . no bounce whatsoever !!! i amazed .... don't bother this one	-1
fabric little stiff first , bust softens acceptable level after few washes . elastic band around waist these boxers contracts point where it wrinkles up fabric . after few hours wear you indents crinkled up band your skin it feels quite uncomfortable . while cheap nicely packaged , these things suck . spend some money decent underwear	1
... shoes weren't quite what i thought they would , although 40 bucks i probably shouldn't expecting highest quality pump . they looked bit cheap , top it all , they too small me . there no return slip package , no number call , no way send shoes back make return , so now i'm stuck 40 dollar cheap looking shoes no one but my little neices fit into -- they're bit too young dressing like ladies evening . my fault buying shoes place called " hollywood heelz , " i should known better . i say this though , i like thin heel shoes came timely fashion . if i could fit them , i'd give them 2-2 1/2 alone	1
i never received this item when i promised it , so it cancelled my account credited	-1

they're pretty , but flimsy . very light construction . lens not really mirrored , so if you attempting hide your eyes , forget it . it would better spend some real money get more professional pair than cheap chinese knock-off . gave them two stars simply because they good looking , but cheap -- they feel way your face .	1
one size fits all doesn't fit my slim body ... item looks " made china " if you know what i mean . rather try double pearl thong or black single pearl thong . they look much " classier " than transparent beads nylon string " string bubbles " panty	-1

initially i going order several items andrew christian , until i saw their shipping prices checkout . $2 shipping each $4 tee-shirt more than excessive , they going charge me $20 shipping $42 order ! i canceled most items , only ordering belt tee . shipping still ~ 50% surcharge . received my order yesterday found belt defective . buckle backwards ( no , it not reversible ... ) plus material belt itself damaged frayed hole . it isn't worth shipping cost hassle send it back , i'll probably just throw it away - but i learn something . i never deal andrew christian again ! i you choose , please pay attention shipping charges when you check out - you may decide revise your order	-1

i broke through toe second wearing . lousy product	-1
this shirt too tapered body sleeves feels very confining . people who like it must quite thin , indeed . it not wrinkle because high percentage polyester but it doesn't breathe very well , either . i am giving it 2 stars only because all color choices , though why someone would want dress shirt some available colors beyond me . price , you better , even someplace like target	1
i bought these my boy thinking they fly front much like mens versions i wear . they my son least favorite underwear mearly cause he pull front them down order use bath room . he only 6 when i trained him i tought him use fly front his underwear . my personal thoughts men's/boy underwear fly front need use , unlike women girls whom don't require it	-1
i glad finally found right pair boots , but it didn't last long . not even 3 weeks after i bought it , it already deteriorated . given i live seattle , rain seeped really easily sole pads started breaking . it like wearing melted cardboard	1

this my first online shoe order . i figured it would pretty safe since it slip-on . i'm usually size 11 or 12 , so i ordered 12 . while my feet pretty wide , i've never purchase wide shoes . these shoes incredibly tight . they long inch , but width unbearably constricted . they reminded me squeezing pair tight rock-climbing boots -- i really squish get my feet . result so uncomfortable , these going back . i wouldn't expected this ' slip-on ' shoes . it gets two instead one since quality appears great	1

i used wear lame-ass y-fronts when i kid my boring folks all shopping . i made switch thongs after i got girlfriend she made it clear i ditch grandpa undies . so i , gladly ! there no way i could go back this ' maxi ' sh*t anymore . i tried one my old pairs few months ago they look freakin huge !! i'm talking fat-guy big . you don't realize how big they until you try modern stuff . so here my advice : if you're still putting up either boxers or briefs throw them trash right now go buy something smaller . you'll happy you	-1
this nice looking wallet , but internal design leaves something desired . there internal flap used credit cards , etc , makes wallet too thick - even if you don't fill it cards . i am tempted cut it out ( it stitched inside ) make wallet less cumbersome . credit card slots also too tight - so you pry cards out - run risk cracking or splitting cards . there nice display your license - small hole cut it so you push license out your thumb when needed ( it also tight slot )	1

these shoes look great , however extremely uncomfortable . they run very small size ( i went up 1 1/2 sizes what i normally wear sm brand ) . i would not recommend them shoes you would wear more than hour time because thong portion cuts into your skin arches heels so high they put alot pressure ball your foot	1

:( these give you pain . i bought these shoes because they looked rather cute picture , considering they weren't just $5 pair shoes , i thought they would somewhat comfortable , if not doable , wear . buyer beware : these shoes cut your heels . they run little small , so i suggest getting least half size larger . if you want anything besides sitting looking pretty , not buy these shoes . i walked less than 2 minutes before they started tearing blistering my heels . they also little tight toes , so if you wide foot , these definitely not you . i admit , they darling cute , but they not worth pain .	-1

i astonished how flimsy poncho turned out . i mean , almost $25 invested included shipping , i expecting better quality . well , it very thin , made china , plastic snaps . so-called polyester lining just adds heat that generated . i've owned many ponchos through years , first thing you learn poncho terrible design keep out elements more than short period . reason involves way it cut . what i've learned you should buy something some weight fabric so wind doesn't lift it up or out allow elements inside . next , you become hot start sweating profusely short time . so , good lining , or breathable system required . if you're just going use it short bursts rain , then you get cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere . however , if you camp lot , or out elements , you need better . best poncho i ever owned rubberized outer layer thin cotton liner . this solves both problems i mentioned , because it weight stay down lining help evaporate sweat	1

advanced exerciser , i am always looking new , innovative challenge . firm body sculpting ball workout provides just . this workout comes sculpting ball , which available three weights ( four , six or eight pounds ) . i used eight pound variety , time we got ab work , i ready put ball away ! my arms really got workout , my core . there several moves require you hold ball out front you , over your head , move it diagonally across your body . i could really feel it my core after workout . once we completed several segments standing work , including grapevine , squats , lunges , we go floor bridge work abs . you hold ball your thighs during bridge work , which i found challenging since time i sweating ball kept slipping away me . you also hold ball your thighs ab crunches , which difficult such heavy ball . afterwards short cool down , which i thought could longer . tina leads , she very fit quite personable . she cues well gives few form pointers way . all new firm releases , background sterile boring . there four background exercisers , allison showing beginner moves . allie holding eight pound ball showing more advanced moves . music nice non-intrusive . beginners enjoy this workout . it isn't complicated four pound ball you could get really intense workout . unless you're advanced some good upper body strength , i would not recommend eight pound ball . you could injure yourself if you go heavy . fact , i wishing i , lighter ball floor work . i all eight new workouts , i've three so far . those , i liked this one best . i felt i got good workout , but i wish it longer . entire workout start finish 32 minutes long . 15 minutes would great , although i suspect my arms would totally fried if we'd kept going much longer . overall , i give this workout high marks . it definitely keeper	1

my wife shopped around amazon looking her grandmother 88th b-day ( coming up soon ) came across handmade hadong silk scarf . every silk scarf she came across she would say , " what beautiful gorgeous hadong silk scarfs they .

" when we got scarf today 4/10/07 ( ordered 4/4/07 ) opened it see what silk scarf looked like person .. my wife wished she ordered one herself , one my mother one more our sister in-law . my wife i definately recommend this place we'll buy few more hadong silk scarfs near future . also , delivery schedule , good packaging love scarfs !	1

recently , i took motorcycle trip atlanta , ga ft . lauderdale , fl . unfortunately , i didn't option riding night when it cooler my thermometer bike showing 100 110 , it felt like riding through oven hair dryer set high blowing my face . i also didn't luxury air conditioning so simulate this so i would pour water my t-shirt let wind cool it down . after getting home , i recalled seeing demonstration cooling vest you soaked water couple minutes then wore under jacket , preferrably mesh . i amazed how well it worked demo so i went online ordered one . particular model i ordered amazon deluxe evaporative cooling vest black . it came week after i ordered it via usps priority mail . they offer several styles colors , including some removable sleevesthe outer shell quilted black nylon 2 outside , zippered pockets zipper up front . neck velcro closure so it fit snuggly around your neck if you want . inner liner blue 100% nylon taslan , water repellant fabric , so it keeps you getting all wet wearing it . out package , it weighs just few ounces but when you put it water , special material , called polymer embedded fabric ( pef ) , inner outer shells absorbs water vest ends up weighing 2-3 lbs . you only need soak it minute . there spandex panels either side allow some expansion . i got large size it fits great , not too tight , not too loose . once water absorbed , instructions ( tag vest ) say you wring it out or use towel blot inner liner dry . not like sponge , wringing it doesn't lot good so i'd suggest blotting if you need . while inner liner water repellant , there might some water it right after you soak it so putting it might get you little wet but if you don't soak it too long , inner liner relatively dry . material holds water doesn't expand like sponge , it just holds lots water ... it pretty interesting stuff . first thing you'll notice after few seconds it cool touch . principle it relies cooling properties water it evaporates it really works . i haven't chance ride it sweltering heat yet , but putting it under my mesh jacket riding without windshield kept me nice cool . i don't think i'd like try it anything less than 65 deg ( ) because i'd probably freeze nor would i want use it under leather jacket unless there some way jacket let wind flow through it . inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get little damp . cooling effect last several hours depending how long you soak it if you want put things front pockets , they lined same material inner liner so they'll stay relatively dry . one thing i've found though , it'll take several days completely dry out unless you ride it . water very slow evaporate but once it , weight goes back down few ounces . bottom line , i highly recommend getting one these if you routinely ride hot weather . they're inexpensive way keep cool they're stylish ( except hi-vis lime green ) . wear it under mesh jacket you won't know it hot outside .	1

i've tried 6 different nursing bras . this one , center snap closure , easiest use . it also lightest most comfortable , while providing good support . my only complaint after 50 washes underwire begins poke free fabric . even when i try sew it back into place , it breaks loose after few washes . perhaps if i handwashed bra instead using machine , it would last longer . this bra less durabe than my other nursing bras ( particularly leading lady bra , which seems indestructible ) , but it well worth sacrifice comfort , lightness , ease use . it far my favorite	1

i hate long socks smelly shoes so i've become big fan shoe liners . i recently ordered set these am very happy them . they each individually priced $5.99 . so 6 pairs you'd pay $36 retail . so this good deal $4/pair . more importantly , they heavy-weight cotton no underside seam . they elastic all around opening actually stay your feet . they cut generously -- my feet size 8 they little big , but manageable . if you smaller feet i'd try get different size than m/l . they ride bit higher foot than some others -- they fine loafers , but lower cut shoe could problematic . i've tried lot these socks : calvin klein , ralph lauren , donna karan , peds , leggs , et al . these far best .	1
my online shoe shopping tip : buy half size bigger than your normal size . if it little too big , you always add inserts achieve betterfit . i also search web additional consumer reviews . pros : this pointy toed boot looks really sexy - great bargain 30 bucks!it easy put short boot . ( it goes up bottom my calf - i'm 5'5)the leather shiney seamless look . stains wipe right off . i'd recommend these nice pair jeans or even youngprofessionals wear their slacks . relatively comfortable . i personally wouldn't wear them all day long . cons : leather stiff . doesn't really bend leg when walking . i think what previous negative review referring . inside shoe nicer softer leather . zipper not best quality . hope this helps you make better shopping decision ! * or , you always buy , try return . if you choose free shipping method you want return item , you just go returns section website andgenerate return label . once amazon receives it processes it , they give you your refund minus shipping cost you savedwhen selecting " free shipping " . ( it usually less than 5 bucks you see amount " your account)enjoy	1
i love my cayman crocs . my sister swore these shoes , but i wasn't convinced because they little different looking . i liked bright colors i saw some people wearing beach this summer , but i'm practical they only go so many things . i ended up purchasing navy pair because they go just anything . i'm not all disappointed . they really don't look bad paired casual outfits . i wish they could make soles all shoes out this stuff though because it amazing . it not so much you slip them say " wow this feels great " ... me it more so after activities ( marathon shopping trips example ) my feet weren't sore or tired when my regular shoes would them ready quit . i think they great ... even " different " look ... though i wish they'd come up more stylish pair some point	1

it only last 7 years or so i've enjoyed wearing robe around house , i admit i used walking around my underwear when i woke up morning ! all my previous robes typically off clearance racks , mostly some kind inexpensive terrycloth . i bought this becuase my last robe falling apart . i say although i hesitated spend 100 bucks robe , when it got here i wore it couple days , i really like it . i bought large black robe ; i'm 6ft , 200lbs , little heavy around middle , robe fits pretty well . arms baggy sleeves long enough touch back my hand just after wrist . length extends just bottom my calf muscle my legs . it " flows " nice too , when i walk , not like heavier terrycloth robe . silk lining makes me feel " rich " ! overall , i like it	1

we needed some plastic coated bibs once we started solids started those super stiff plastic ones babies us . stiff bibs great keeping her clothes dry when she would keep her bib off her high chair . we've got svan high chair ( best ! ) pretty small opening kid torso , so stiff bib you constantly stuffing there such pain . also , when cleaning , if you got back ( fabric ) side bib wet , bib would cold wet hours . bumkins bibs washed thorougly soap water sink then hung up . they totally dry next meal ! they so soft our daugher doesn't mind wearing them . they not get way stay nicely tucked ( assuming our daughter doesn't pull bib up look " bib goodies " pocket ) . we bought 2 sets could easily use more . they also washed washing machine ( no dryer but they air dry super fast )	1
this bra great those us smaller busts . it only bra i'll wear under my t-shirts now because it doesn't show outline through shirt like every other padded bra i've found . it very comfortable . only downside mine lose it form ( it not tight fitting it used ) little bit faster than some other bras . but , it absolutely worth buying replacement . i just hope they never stop making this bra	1

i looking lightest , slimmest possible wallet , dopp getaway just perfect . first couple weeks i kept sticking my hand my pocket make sure it still there - it unobtrusive . it made out soft , thin leather ( so thin , actually , embossed lettering my credit cards shows through surface ) . might affect durability , but it certainly keeps overall bulk wallet down . illustration shows large embossed crest , but mine arrived only discreet lettering saying " dopp " bottom - significant improvement , my mind . wallet pockets 3 credit cards little pouch , open top one side , hold your cash . there also one additional pocket that ideal other documents you just carry . only slight negative me caramel-colored vinyl lining cash pocket . i don't know why they used such low-class material there . it invisible outside , not really offensive , but if i could change one thing , would it . i debated knocking off star it , but overall function appearance wallet so excellent i thought it deserved full five stars . overall , if you're disciplined what you carry , you'll love small size low bulk this wallet .	1

i using hanes brand boxers years i swear them . material light not cling thighs . basic design seams running up cheeks bottom not up centre . this prevents boxer clinging centre behind . boxers durable remain wearable many years . note front flap stay open after continuous use should pressed retain `closed ' look . color selection somewhat minimal . 3-pack usually 2 one color when there should 3 different colors/patterns . why buy : your `main ' line boxers - practical everyday use . you want see your man looking sexy even after many washes	1

sansha s1c still stands best all-around canvas ballet slipper . though this somewhat jokingly christened ' bedtime slipper , ' looseness off foot , line working feet very visible , especially after repeated use . where bloch capezio tend require multiple fittings testing different styles- especially through mail order- sansha styles , long they purchased correct approximate widths lengths , mold individual feet stand years good care . only reservation i these shoes leather soles ' capacity holding onto everything they pass over extended period time . if you dance meticulous studio , this not issue , but where stray drop soda or gatorade occassionally spilt , you may want scuff soles once week . washing not seem clean leather well canvas , eventual buildup impede turns	1

one thing i want stress this backpack how good it feels your shoulders when you've got it loaded few books your laptop . it feels like someone standing back you suspending weight off your shoulders . pack sits high you shoulders- stays there ( no slipping or sliding ) keeps weight off your lower back . it compact , slim , low profile , yet plenty roomy enough carry few extra books . it got two roomy main compartments , lot bigger than it looks gadget pouch area . my main complaint gadget pouch- it not all convenient reach grab pen or whatever , because zipper scrunches up when you try open compartment . if i use this my everyday backpack , rather than my laptop backpack i think i'd get rather annoyed this . but i primarily use it transport my laptop it it better than i could hoped it .	1

i just started doing water aerobics needed shoe traction while pool . unfortunately , i need wear sandals medical reasons apparently no one ( including columbia ) makes water aerobics sandal . i tried these because they sounded like they could handle exposure water really good price . they handle water just fine , drying completely 8 hours show no sign falling apart . traction isn't strong i would like , but it better than bare feet or damaged toes shoes . also , sandals create more drag water than regular water aerobics shoes , making my feet cramp more than they probably would . i gave product five stars because sandals performing way they advertised ; i'm just using them something they weren't designed	1
these very comfortable beach shoes i very pleased price . i would change color names because they too vague i could only guess which one would match my swimsuit	1

adidas makes very nice summer sandals . this cheapest i've seen . i buy them my kids every summer ... they last all summer beyond , unlike other sandals . my kids think they cool too	1
trip beach , just down street , or warm outing , these sandals serve their purpose . first foremost , soles massage feet every step . sensation quite soothing especially when first breaking them . even after these sandals longer than year they still cushion feet very well . addidas brand outer design blast wear show off . it funny , but true i actually receive attention pertaining pair sandals . this pair best both worlds	1
my wife loves this kind earmuff ( over top head ) . she doesn't like ones wrap around back your head/neck - she finds those squeeze her head aren't comfortable after long periods time ( fall off ) . this model her favorite she wears them every ( winter ) day . this her second pair 6-7 years - they seem long life . very durable , fold up nicely put your pocket . yet easy open put your head . she known wear them hours time finds them very comfortable . they stay your head even when running/jogging , also light weight , wind proof , warm	1
i very disappointed when i opened package gemavenue . here why : 1 . ear muffs very low quality . hardly worth $14.99 gemavenue ( e4hats ) charged me it . $0.99 would fair deal . 2 . ear muffs advertised new but it definite " second hand " feel it . it reminded me opened merchandise salvation army store !!! no joke . fact there no tags it all inform me where it made , what it made , washing instructions , etc . it not even name manufacturer !!!! 3 . plastic band felt very fragile like it would break slightest pressure . adjusting width nerve-racking because i very careful not break it ! 4 . " wool " (?) very synthetic feel it . furthermore it sparse flat .... not warm fuzzy . i doubt very much it sheepskin claimed gemavenue . besides , there no tag indicate it wasnt fact some sort cheap polyester . 5 . i tried it it not cover my ears completely , so you sure its not going keep my ears warm all . conclusion , this product not new , not soft , not warm , not genuine sheepskin !!! what more i say ? i am just disgusted gem avenue ( e4hats ) selling me this rip off useless piece junk !!! i never buy anything gem avenue ( e4hats ) ever again !!	-1
i've wanting these since last summer ... price seller ! comfortable light-weight ... crocs great	1

these thong panties way serve up some romance not very much money . they're inexpensive , feel great , look better . i love scalloped lace , love way it wraps around me , leaving no panty line . wear these skirt or tight fitting pants it'll look like you've got nothing all under your clothes . these hit me	1
these my single favorite pair underwear . not your typical mens undewear but much more comfortable stylish . i'm military so first i thought " thongs not " real men " but after wearing these i found they , lot more guys wear thongs jocks than you realize . i wear these every day activivties , sports , work , leisure . there isn't much fabric so they're great under jeans my girlfriend thinks there sooo sexy . after wearing them while it like nothing there because they support you only where you need it . if you've never owned thong , i think you should give these shot . i definately recomend calvin klein body thong	1

i recently received these my husband present - several other love fifi items - all which crotchless . these pretty french knickers first bunch i tried -- i absolutely loved `em ! over years my hubby always given me different kinds lingerie , all them mainly ethereal or low-cut , but nothing scandalous . i think we both ready change . i immediately fell love high-on-the-hips almost bottomless look these knickers - how they made my legs look even longer ! fabric much sheerer than what i expecting , but visual effect pretty close what seen photo . these first crotchless panties i'd ever tried . it felt different expose so much my cheeks back ( compared other boy-cut shorts i worn ) . but it definitely feeling openness front - made me feel sexiest ! i wore these bed one evening matching-color camisole top . even though these knickers made me more accessible ( which wonderful during our warm up ) , i still removed them ( out habit ) when things got more passionate ! more general usage , i could easily see myself wearing these under my dress or skirt - when dining out my husband ( tease ) . but i'd probably want consider getting more thorough waxing first ! finish up , i guess i always thought crotchless panties little tasteless . but these cute french knickers - other items i received love fifi - beautiful they made me feel !	1

" wool nylon blend ? " it impossible responsible consumer if you not know what you buying . my poor review based this . my opinion technology yet replace abilities natural materials like wool silk . course , this only my opinion preference . however , when manufactures refuse inform buyer more than " wool nylon blend ? " there no mechanism consumer make informed choice or even purchase what they looking . stretch nylon certainly nice form fit ease when it comes slipping your foot onto your sock into your boot . but - if too much nylon present it show its downside should hiker or hunter find themselves wet situation hiking long periods . it would seem age 100% wool sock almost gone i accept my fate , but i urge people not buy sock , which not disclose details its manufacture . review reflects " full disclosure advertising " not product itself . should amazon find it inappropriate then deletion understandable .	-1

this compact traveling case . compact doesn't mean tiny . it probably one smaller name-brand standard size ones i've seen ( kenneth cole , perry ellis , swiss army , nautica , etc ) , but it not different size category . just different shape , slightly less deep , yet nice solid broad base ( bottom solid material which doesn't collapse ) . it definitely big enough average man toiletries . i like it . it also doesn't lot inside pockets . there just one wallet-sized pouch inside which doesn't its own zipper . not mesh . i'm not sure what it big enough - floss lip balm ? rest inside open free . it water-proof lining wire flaps open compartment wide ( essential toiletries bag really ) . well-crafted what i tell . outside very handsome patterned leather . it looks aged without looking worn . it also smells leather out box - so much nicer than faux-leather travel kits . you won't mind your clothes rub against it your luggage . i slight quibble handle - it not easy grab most kits . it more loop than handle . so those cons : not lot compartments inside , not huge . pros : leather , opens very wide , looks good , durable	1

i've loved wearing two pairs these sandals i , they've held up really well . tan ones fine , but blue-dyed ones got wet once , they stained my feet blue quite badly . it very hard remove , i went around very odd-looking feet quite while . i'd like buy more because they adjust fit my narrow feet , but i'm afraid black ones stain my feet black if i get caught rain	1

chargers your basic necessities they work fine . silicone skin better than average protection but expect some adjustmens how you work zen . it impacts zen sensitivity .	1
skin fits well both chargers work perfectly ( so far ! ) also , i impressed their extremely fast shipping . i ordered it friday it tuesday , monday postal holiday ! wow ! skin more flexible than i expected , but it stays place nicely while allowing all controls used normally . belt clip little weird , but i probably won't use it anyway . i really like not carry vision:m dongle around charge it , now i leave dongle it usb cable not worry losing it . excellent deal	1

after trying tons different nursing bras almost giving up hope finding something comfortable , supportive easy use , i found this bra ( now own 8 them ) . breastfeeding counselor , i always suggest moms they look something without underwire ( cause plugged ducts some moms , esp . beginning ) . this bra gives support without sacrificing shape or comfort . some comfy nursing bras ( bravado sleep bras ) give you " uniboob " look-not flattering under close-fitting shirts . this one looks awesome . this bra also very forgiving size changes , cups stretchy allow growth ( , later , shrinking ) . find best fit , go boutique let them size you . then order right size online .

i purchased this coat online my husband . he needed new topcoat wear over his suits work . although it looks pretty nice picture , it poor quality . this coat pretty thin wrinkles fast . because it so light weight , it doesn't hang well . it also small white mark ( almost looked like wax ) lapel . it not same quality most department store top coats . if you looking something looks professional , i wouldn't recommned it . i found better topcoat same price sale macy ralph lauren . i returned this coat jos banks .	1
this dress extremely sexy . i use different shoes belts it change look . it very attractive good vibe when you're wearing it .	1
i've wearing these shoes years . they're comfortable shoes get , they available eee widths half sizes , so they fit me well . their soles synthetic , not leather ; this may make them less elegant , but it also least quintuples how long they last . soles heels never wear out me ; eventually leather uppers get too scuffed keep wearing them except around house yard . except tiny little " buckle " strap , they no metal them , which means they go through all airport metal detectors without setting them off . soles thin , so i never made take them off airport security either . well , not until latest pointless revision tsa rules . someday sense may return airports , then lack metal helpful again	1
you get away wearing it office , but sole doesn't quite look like formal dress attire . they're super soft walk . but , all padding makes them uncomfortably hot except cold weather . i would think this niche product , but florsheim seems portray them extremely popular product	1

lilyette 458 best bra ever !! i slave bali because . ) didn't really know what cup size i needed ; but more importantly , . ) most stores don't carry anything larger than dd cup size didn't fit so i could see what fit . no bali " minimizer " fits me regardless size . i cannot seem fit into bali cone/rocket design . even if i , it wholly unflattering . lilyette #428 rocket shaping it looks ridiculous . this cup design gives smooth , curvy , high-riding , natural look . no points , cones , or rockets . i love it	1

i love this shoes but my daughter like them better , shoes arrived timely but when i tried them they too small . my daughter kept them they look gorgeous	1
this good case made nice materials . it offers nice fit buttons easily usable . it comes clear screen protector belt clip so you carry it more comfortably . it just little bulky , but nothing worry if you plan carry it your belt , hand bag or hands . it could only fit big pockets , though . my only serious gripe inner seams , they very rough could scratch surface your player . yes , zen vision:m very soft coating this could leave marks . anyways , you really should consider getting skin your zen ( best skins ever ) any case . this very good case overall	1
i great deal research choosing case my new ipod . i decided iskin , i quite satisfied my decision . i remember , however , bit confused just how this case worked . so , clarify future buyers , case comprised : -first , thin , transparent silicone ( rubber ) sleeve . sleeve covers most front back , including slightly thinner cover where wheeel would placed . this ensures wheel maintains its touch sensitivity while also protected . skin not , however , cover screen , portion back also exposed attach optional belt clip . this sleeve also come various colors , but i used clear one highlight natural color my ipod . -second , hard , clear plastic front plate snapped front ipod once it placed silicone . this hard case cover screen , all front ipod , except hole touch wheel . once attached , hard cover firmly held place . put together , this case provides exceptional protection . silicone very thin , yet protects against ordinary dings scratches . hard plastic protects front impact , screen scratches . best part me , even both silicone hard cover , ipod nano still retains its very thin size - case not bulky least . conclusion , i highly recommend this case anyone who purchases ipod nano . protect your investment	1
this great buy . i iskin my 30gb ipod i loved it . so when i bought my mom ipod nano christmas , i chose iskin nano protect her product . plastic protection nano iskin different than regular iskin , it clips over rubberized skin rather than under it , but design carries it off perfectly . one small complaint instructions removing belt clip - they didn't adequately explain removal , leaving me worried i'd break clip , but some small effort , i got it . great products great price . i researched all kinds protection ipods these best	1

i recently purchased small ameribag healthy back bag anticipation long summer trek through europe . i didn't think my backpack would secure pickpocketers , i wanted something little more " grown up . " here some reasons i am very happy this purchase : 1 ) comfort . my healthy back bag more comfortable than either backpack or large purse . its wide strap sets securely my shoulder without hand it , it adjusts easily so i carry it across my chest . you put lot it not feel weight - you not end up your shoulder knots end day . 2 ) security . zippered compartment openings fit neatly beneath my armpit ; there interior zipper pockets well , so it pretty hard imagine someone hand slipping into bag without my knowing it . wide strap reinforced so it would hard cut . 3 ) convenience . this bag supremely well-designed features . outside , there flat zipper pocket ( good your subway pass ) separate velcro pocket one side , velcro pocket flap other , small pocket suitable ( say ) sunglass end . main zipped compartment wide variety open pockets ( perhaps pen , camera , pda or ipod ) , including one conveniently placed sidways so you easily get it when it still your shoulder . one perfect cellphone . there flat inside zipper pocket serves me well wallet . 4 ) capacity . i've got small version bag , it still hold wide variety daily essentials : wallet , phone , camera , ipod , paperback , compact umbrella , even perhaps very light sweater . biggest problem these bags figuring out which one you want - err small side ( they more comfortable ) , then choose whatever fabric color suits your fancy . you even get them premium leather , but my microfibre one seems easy clean good value . this my favorite bag - i easily see several decades my future healthy back bag under my arm .	1

can't go wrong this partner @ amazon . top quality product/delivery/service . this company deserves your business !!!!	1
i used this clothesline all over europe south america multiple trips , i love it . no clothespins needed , because you attach your clothes inside braid rubber . it packs up into almost nothing weighs almost nothing . you take one end clothesline , wrap it around something , such pipe or bedpost , or even doorknob , loop it through itself . you then take other end clothesline , small hook ( you get one separately ) , hook it itself . this hold lot weight - i've two pairs wet jeans 2 pairs wet shirts , socks , underwear all line same time . sure , it'll sag , but it no problem . don't get any clotheslines suction cups end - what if all you around wood concrete ? then there'll nothing suction cups . you can't really hang your clothes dry bathtub when you share bathroom other people ..	1

" also , i wouldn't recommend this someone who skinny . i don't think it would look way it should you . when i say skinny i mean nicole richie- scarecrow skinny .	1
i bought jersey shirt , thinking it would look really cute over jeans . when i opened package i apalled !! it looked like pillow case holes sleeves . edges weren't stitched fabric thin cheap looking . i yet return this item ... i not buy this company again !	-1
very useful thing travel . suction cups absolutely worthless -- would fall soon anything placed line sometimes even if nothing placed line -- , but since you wrap line around something hook it itself , that not too much problem unless you can't find anything else cord loop around . two twisting strands very helpful -- no clips required . only challenge i ran into finding places hook cords onto -- i get bit creative curtain rods window bars , it won't stretch across entire room -- but expected . overall , i highly recommend .	1

this jacket fits very nicely . it impressively waterproof , while still breathable . it fairly warm , which makes it good colder weather but not so good casual jacket . only major flaw fount outside pockets zippers around openings so when you take your hands or out them it scrapes against you , which discouraging enough inhibit use those pockets	1
these good quality i like lock , it not too big not look like something break easily . they also come instructions how use them . i bought them my 7 8 year old kids too they like them	1

excellent wear cold , wonderful fit form . i bought 36 found it too tight , it fits now either weight loss or stretching . i bought 38 t-shirt model , it fits pretty good . my suggestion get professional measurement before choosing your size . this bra wonderful !!	1
slightly padded molded cups this bra wonderful prevent nipples showing through - even if you're cold , if you get my drift . buxom woman ( 36ddd ) , i'm cursed " wandering " nipples , bra lines showing through shirts sweaters , bossoms " swing low " other embarrassing problems . this bra relatively comfortable generally speaking , it very comfortable compared minimizers other " hold'em up hold'em place " bras . personally , i think svelt look bra gorgeous . big chest , i've never able wear those lacy little bras victoria secret , so this actually big improvement over what my husband refers " industrial strength " bras like our grandmothers wear . i only give it four stars because underwire not comfortable if you sit long periods time desk like i ; it begins " dig " bit right beneath rib cage . overall , it great bra ( 1 ) hide nipples , ( 2 ) provide your breasts wonderfully rounded shape , ( 3 ) hides bra lines ( great t-shirt bra ) , ( 4 ) show off your cleavage but not bra itself ( if you wear low cut blouse ) . i think you'll like it ; remember , you tend get what you pay these days . days $18 bras far behind us	1

don't particularly like cotton or stretch cotton panties . these i say awesome , fit great , comfie . they shrink when you put them dryer , so , i suggest you don't put them dryer , or buy next size bigger then put them dryer . however , bikinis , cotton , these just perfect . i personally love " jockey " or if i must , i like hanes microfiber . just my opinion . hanes make lot choose , so , they great reasonably priced . i find you need different styles different pants , or jeans ..... don't like thongs , so string bikini nylon always works well , they run big , nylon always so get your perfect size ..... most important thing ladies , let get comfortable what we wear lolthanks , good luc	1

these comfortable versatile , since they look great almost anything . strap back heel doesn't rub like other slingbacks i've worn , after many hours wear , strap not stretched out . only reason i gave it four stars i may preferred little higher heel .	1
i love these running down basement or just walking around house cold day .	1
i bought these warmth so they're fine me . your feet not get cold these . but they like walking flippers . there no arch support sole like frozen slab steak all flexibility , weight thickness it posesses . i should also mention buying size smaller works fine . they'd even clumsier if too large	1
this pink very " weird " . it not quite pastel baby pink , more neon pink , but not bright either ... i don't know how describe it . photo not accurate . because it doesn't quite match any other pink i own , i tend only pair them black top . they super comfy , though ... so i still recommend them . soft fabric , nice pockets .	1

i ordered this item wear under white black sheath style spaghetti strap prom dress my senior prom . i ordered it body beige , which plenty light , not show through my white dress . it little hard put , but that expected firm control stuff , also , bra part didn't want stay up very well . i felt like i keep tugging it up , but it just felt saggy , it didn't look saggy . this may because back unitart pretty low shape accomadate most back styles dresses . i think adding velcro bra inside my dress solve this problem . also , two pieces boning sides poke my waist rather unnaturally . alone it looks kind funny , but dress you can't tell . there gussett crotch allow trips restroom but i'm not sure how well this work , i not tried it yet . i'm hoping i won't ... overall quality very good money it very nice job shaping smoothing without showing under white dress	1

i own 2 these shirts ; price , they're great . they're perfect length me , hitting just hip . material thin stretchy enought they're easily layered camisoles , long-sleeved shirts , etc ., but it not so thin one must wear layer . they're really easy wear seem decent quality	1
this wonderful robe ; i agree everything mentioned other reviews ( except feather leakage ... not problem i noticed . ) however : i bought small ; it fit perfectly until i washed it ( gentle cycle , cold water , tumble dried low ) it shrank up too short length sleeves too tight across shoulders . i love it so much i am going buy medium give small away . i don't dry cleaning , i wear robe enough so it needs washing more than twice year (!) . so choose your size carefully if you plan machine wash it .	1

i got this present my sweetie he loves them . it great bargain real shearling moccasins :	1
these silk pajamas , my opinion , much higher quality stitching , tailoring details , well heavier weight silk than closely priced dreamsacks pajamas . sizing help : help clarify sizing people ( there conflicting reviews here ) , i ordered medium but then returned it . i probably get some minor alterations , but i don't blame company ... everyone shaped differently . i am 6'0 " weigh 175 . my suit measurements 42 " chest , 34 " sleeves , 32 " pants inseam . medium body fit but sleeves pants too short . large best fit overall , although roomier around chest than i would prefer . but if you my size large your best option .	1
all men silk pjs i purchased over years my husband this one best . fabric nice heavy weight it it survives machine washing well . after reading other customers ' reviews , i purchased medium size person who usually wears size occasionally . it turned out too small . i would recommend going one size up	1

i bought this robe silk pajamas my boyfriend valentine day , both size large . pajamas fit nicely , but robe way too big ! i printed out return label listing reason return product not fit description online . amazon said this not their fault deducted cost shipping my refund , not offer opportunity exchange . so , now i re-order robe smaller size , price gone up $7 since valentine day . this would good deal if it run true size , but because misrepresentations made i end up paying close full price listed . moral : order one size smaller than you think you need .	1
i thought wearing silk robe more affectation than anything else . happily , i wrong . this robe well-made , comfortable , it really looks nice .	1

what would you expect levi strauss ? these comfortable 5-pocket jeans wear like iron . they not fancy jeans , but i live them weekend	1
levi strauss signature fairly new line jeans developed levi strauss especially discount store channel , mainly target , wal-mart , kmart . fit regular levi strauss signature similar if not identical fit zipper fly 505 , levi strauss most popular model blue jeans . main difference there less sewing detail rear pockets side just below waist , no red tab rear pocket . finishes mainstream stonewash light , medium dark . if you live this limited choice finishes you save few bucks buying levi strauss signature jeans . however , they offer no advantage over levi strauss red tabs other than lower price .	1

leather not premium ( should not this price ) , but wallet hold great number cards pretty compact size package . if you like me - carry tons cards hate thickness other wallets , also like see all cards without pulling them out then this way go . only drawback - business cards not fit plastic inserts , so only place you them leather pocket inside part cover . if you carry lot business cards wont work you . but me it not big deal long i 3 them they not getting dirty . overall i'm satisfied definitely recommend this product	1

this good , functional scarf . material typical polar fleece . it soft , but not exceptionally so . it very warm , but you breathe through it if you use it cover your face . it made acrylic polyester , it machine washable . one complaint i might edges finished stitching feels rough touch . also , i would liked seen few more inches length . but it certainly long enough use . overall , this scarf nothing get excited , full retail price seems bit high , but if you get it sale , you won't regret it . it what you need scarf	1

like other jocks this line bike , swimmer style total winner ! made high-quality materials , it height performance fit . smaller waistband allows greater movement less restrictive fit especially if you're doing any kind cardio exercise like running , biking or eliptical machine . contoured pouch made blended fabric allows maximum moisture absorption breatheability , while cupping supporting you . leg straps comfortable width don't roll or cut under your cheeks . my only complaint i wish they would come out black version like they their standard jock . get rid your old jock buy bunch these - i ! course look around , jocks here amazon seem bit pricy , this $6.95 jock i found local sporting goods store $3.99 , or 2-pack $7.50	1

i am larger guy needed light windbreaker-type jacket hood would also keep rain off my head ( that seattle ya ) . since none local stores these stock i searched amazon found this one . jacket excellent quality better than i expected it . it breaks wind extremely well , if you really need bundle up there velcro strips sleeve openings , draw strings around waist snaps go over zipper . all all this excellent wind breaker jacket . it won't keep you warm very cold weather , but it one best light jackets i've ever owned . when i placed my order november 16 , 2006 i chose ' standard shipping ' promised shipping date nov . 20 nov . 27 . i received item nov . 27 . i can't say sure whether i would received it sooner thanksgiving day not fallen within week , so i won't really complain receiving date . my complaint order , however , this : time i placed my order time i received jacket , advertised sale price dropped 25 percent , $10.00 . i ordered jacket paid $39.95 but time i got it , price $29.99 . this didn't seem right me . i've written turfer resolution but not yet received one . if this resolved favorably , i'll edit this review . except price dispute , i highly recommend this jacket if you need light windbreaker type jacket . it serve you very well . just make sure you get right price !! edit : still no response turfer price change , but amazon stated policy prices availability may change without notice , so i guess it buyer beware . i notice today price this item still $29.99 . i've using it 2 months now i must say it fantastic lightweight jacket . i want buy one but i'm afraid second i order it price drop $19.99 !!!	1

design this shoes make my feet look good , it hugs them right places ( my feet bit wide ) . they look fun too ( i got blue ones ) . they feel comfortable enough walk couple hours ( they light cushioning , they somehow stable ) , but becareful during those hot days because you get blisters your feet since they not leather . size , i'm 7.5 sandals 8 boots . these shoes i get 8 so they fit my wide feet , they just fine . they make me look really tall , yet more comfortable than other high heel shoes . i like . it true after while walking them your feet hurt front . ( after one or two hours )	1

these silk pajamas , my opinion , much higher quality stitching , tailoring details , well heavier weight silk than closely priced dreamsacks pajamas . sizing help : help clarify sizing people ( there conflicting reviews here ) , i ordered medium but then returned it . i probably get some minor alterations , but i don't blame company ... everyone shaped differently . i am 6'0 " weigh 175 . my suit measurements 42 " chest , 34 " sleeves , 32 " pants inseam . medium body fit but sleeves pants too short . large best fit overall , although roomier around chest than i would prefer . but if you my size large your best option .	1
this good quality pajama set worth price i paid amazon discount . forewarned color really bright red though	1
these shorts durable , comfortable , fit well . it took me long time find pair shorts short inseam . these fit bill . tag inside waistband slightly itchy/scratchy , otherwise i would given them 5 stars	1

i love this bag price perfect . i bought it primarily my 15 " notebook computer . i wary this bag because it doesn't padding/rigid structure protect computer but i rarely lug my computer around outside going airport , car , friend house , etc . this bag perfect short distances where i don't stand idle longer than 30 minutes ( strap isn't comfortable heavy load ) . but like i say , i'm not walking around heavy load very long . now ! most awesome feature , once i'm my hotel my computer desk where it stay until time go back airport , i stylish simple all purpose canvas bag put my book , scarf , notebook , or whatever . try carrying around typical laptop bag without looking like laptop guy . now i one , benefits slim multi-purpose bag far outweigh my desire padding . this bag fits bill dual purposes . if you carry around your computer all time you may want consider buying something padding bottom some rigidity . i wouldn't ever want drop bag my notebook it or i might need new pc . but come ! sub-$20 bucks !!! great deal .	1
i just got this bag love it ! it not too big , but enough able put laptop couple notebooks or textbooks . should last long time	1

this boot good casual boot skirts/dresses but runs little big foot - could size down 6 5 1/2 . it also very narrow calf which great me but not average or larger sized calf woman . boot cute but wish toe less rounded give it more fashionable appeal	1

well , what i say ? this package serves its purpose , but $9.95 you can't really expect alot else . skin cover great , keeps zen vision safe , no question , but everything else low quality . screen protector almost impossible apply properly , arm band would great if view stand wasn't permanently attatched , therefore cutting into your arm every time you use it . i haven't used belt clip yet , but it doesn't look out ordinary , so i'm sure its fine . if you looking primarily skin cover , yourself favor just buy pick up brand accessories	1
well , after using my creative zen naked , no covering all ; other popular leather cover ; this sillicon cover/package , i honestly say , considering price what included this package , this , far , best route go when picking case your own zen . other main case , leather one , looks nice , but around $30 , i expect little more functionality . this cover few dollars cheaper , , i would only expect cover , included leather one . but , when you take into account screen protector that included ( which costs $15 itself other places ) , stand back ( which , granted , mildly weak , but look what it holding up .... if you watch your share videos movies your zen , i , back-stand comes very handy ) , other things , i would expect it more . so , don't let cheap price deter you getting this one , it almost me , thinking it poor quality . sillicon tends attract dust lint , but it wipes or blows away easily , , really , only thing comes close downside . get this case . you won't regret it	1
crocs very comfy great walking wareing beach . i ware mine everyday . they very useful because u just slide them or u put strap run them they wont come off	1

i bought this robe silk pajamas my boyfriend valentine day , both size large . pajamas fit nicely , but robe way too big ! i printed out return label listing reason return product not fit description online . amazon said this not their fault deducted cost shipping my refund , not offer opportunity exchange . so , now i re-order robe smaller size , price gone up $7 since valentine day . this would good deal if it run true size , but because misrepresentations made i end up paying close full price listed . moral : order one size smaller than you think you need .	1
robe not fit me . i wanted return it , got return item number , got busy , not get it mail soon enough . they strict 30 day return ploicy . nordstroms not this . i could exchange it there . sorry i got job not time petty rules . i go elsewhere next time	-1

i'm very happy this purchase . great hiking many extra pockets carrying ' stuff ' beyond water	1
we purchased couple these during $10 off $40 purchase pleasantly surprised quality . frequently , it hard judge whether particular brand clothing run small or larger , but know up front these run larger end . shirts very thick some warmest sweatshirts we ever come across - you won't keep these long warm house . only minor complaint we could express they bit stiffer than others , but likely due weave why they so warming . cuffs not quite snug we would like , but it better than tight . overall , price quality , these can't beat	1
i big thighs , so i can't wear boxer briefs or regular full-cut briefs because they always ride up . your jewels always seem get smashed your legs if you don't walk just right you keep adjusting yourself all day , right ? these hip briefs , however , cut up much higher so they can't ride up your thighs or hips ( not high bikini briefs , though , so you relax ) , waistband sits or just below your hips . make things even better , they're cut perfectly-shaped " pouch " front keeps your goods out harm way . i couple other brands " pouch " briefs , but this one shape got it just right ! i couple different styles calvin klein hip briefs , they're all basically same cut ( which important part ) . only thing really differs his various underwear lines fabrics involved : " body " cotton some stretch ; " xt " breathable spandexy stuff stay dry while exercising or dancing ; " pro mesh " really mesh made me feel awkwardly like stripper ; " pro stretch " sort like body fabric but more lycra	1
i got them 1/2 size bigger they fit perfect . these boots sexiest thing ever they really comfortable . quality also superb . you don't run across find like these very often . honey color more beautiful person . what more i say .... apepazza cutest most comfortable boots ever . i can't wait get different style	1

these socks amazing ! they go way up your knee , fitted all over , stay up without squeezing too much - i've looking socks like this long time	1
sizing review spot-on . i wear size 6 street shoe , my treadmill/track shoes ( adidas supernova classics ) 7.5 - kumasis i wear 6.5 . first pair i won mudddy buddy race , i loved them so much i got second pair - one really muddy , wet days other dusty , drier ones . recommended them my mom cousin , too , they love them . all 3 us high arches narrow heels . my mom aaa width , i'm narrow heel . all happy . big props adidas	1
i delighted find out keds still makes sneakers i bought kid . i just wore out last pair i -- i purchased extras least twenty years ago , so haven't look new till now . well , almost same sneaker ... these don't seem made same last old models ; they aren't quite good fit , but still pretty comfortable , sole still flexible light weight . inside lined terry-like material -- improvement , i think , if it holds up wear . colored stripe around outside bottom gone . i'm sorry , it gave them more streamlined appearance . but unless these new champions don't wear well , i definitely look more when i wear out these two pairs decade now	1
i am very satisfied safety/protection this ipod case provides my ipod . it very convenient !	1
these best boots out there , they feel like shoes you walk run these all day . military i told i not wear them back garrision so i am taking advantage wearing them ira	1
i not taken this vacation yet , but compared other fanny packs , this one seems very durable . i wish it little more room , but i think nicely . only drawback i alter waist strap because it too big ( i am size 8 ) even when i it small it would go . i like all different sections pockets keep items separate	1
this my fourth fanny pack . it seems better made than most . particular , belt buckle seems higher quality than most , that point failure two my previous packs . ( i wish i could find one metal buckle . ) there two changes i would make this design . first , side pockets too small because they join main part pack single seam . front panel side pocket needs join main front panel pack second seam maybe 3/8 " farther forward . this would make side pockets much larger more useful . besides , i note there only single seam joining belt pack . time tell , but i suspect this may become failure point . second or even third row stitching here would make me feel more confident . all said , it seems like very good pack -- zippers pulls high quality , pockets all lined , there plenty pockets including two security pockets money other small valuables -- i would give it 4 1/2 stars if i could -- just not 5 : -	1
this versatile boot(s ) works casual office best weekends . great deal ( price wise : $29.79 ) too ! there smooth , leather upper stays put stretch zipper ( fabric around zipper , but rest smooth , soft leather ) . although fits true size it reads " 8 � , " first it felt bit narrow ( especially around ankle ) but it became loose after i wear it . advanced cushioning , padded insole comfort flexible sole . over all , very comfortable classy !	1

i'm very happy impressed . my last briefcase stolen ( everything it ) , so i decided make best it treat myself bag i actually liked . looked some very pricey options local stores couldn't find anything style i looking . took risk bought this over internet ( significantly less $ than others i considering ) i am extremely happy it . case , even when full not bulky , but stores surprising amount . there open slots hold both my notebook my organizer , zippered section my files , two flat zippered sections miscelanious papers , two 1/2 size pockets holding my camera newspaper perfectly , slots business cards pen organizer . quality great , thick leather , nice stitching . my only minor complaint latches magnetic . i prefer physical catch type they little easier latch without looking . i actually took some brown shoe polish it right away give it more aged patina love it . i also cut off stupid cell-phone holder because i thought it ugly , bulky , i would never use it even if my phone fit . overall i'm extremely happy both david king bag luggagepoint service . i would gladly buy them again	1

i fortunate able pick up chocolate lab striped oxford when it offered winter . there nothing plain this oxford . i would say classic because clean lines gentle shaping provided darts back . additional benefit generally all bealls ' long-sleeve oxfords they shorter length than most traditional oxfords . most oxford shirts 27 " -28 " length misses size ( 0-20 ) , but bealls ' tend run 25 " -26 " depending your size proportion . advantage you not feel need tuck , but you still tuck if you would like . personally , i never fan tucking shirts into pants or skirts , especially if you want highlight either . whoever sews these garments takes great care . back darts aligned perfectly button thread criss-cross style double looping underneath extra strength . actual striping shirt straight . i've seen some more expensive shirts where someone either didn't follow pattern correctly or tried correct improper pattern badly . me , makes tremendous difference whether i come back more . i am looking forward more colors again . chocolate lab stripe only one i own i've many ask me where i purchased . i would love see all colors which offered 3/4 sleeve version addition kelly green , gatsby yellow ( short-sleeve version color ) perhaps even beautiful violet . definitely try this shirt because i know you pleased	1

... samsonite sling ( rose wine)looks great constructed well all great features , reason 4 stars(ipod holder , hole earphones , cell holder , holder school disks or cd-roms , pen pencil holder keyring ) . i wish you could give half stars . ( 4 1/2 stars ! ) ... very sturdy extra padding comfort . but warned , my daughters larger text books dont fit , nor her mead trapper looseleaf or her nike portfolio . top corner sticks out two three inches zipper unable fully close , so she carry them her hands ; which kind defeats purpose carrying handsfree bag . spiral notebooks mead composition books(black white ) fit perfectly . ... gripe she probably 100 pounds soaking wet , so strap isn't flush her body . shes tall slim 13 1/2 year old . it fit chubbies bustier girls whole lot better . velcor strip short , so there isn't much more ability adjust make it tighter .... samsonite either make strap shorter so it doesnt hit her booty when she walks or lenghten amount velcro they use so theres more ability adjust fit . we thought during colder months it might fit little better her winter coats , but it still hits her too low her body . we'd rather it more snug fit . she still loves it though , because color it holds all her stuff well ... cell phone , ipod , keys , bus pass , pens etc . minus 1/2 star size fit . overall great bag , 4 1/2 stars	1

this far , worst product you could ever purchase your very expensive mp3 player . i purchased this item after trying out one silcone skins ripped apart after 3 months use . i use my mp3 player when i go running so i need armband product withstand elements my running . after using this product only 3 times , it began fall apart follows : 1 . protective screen cover nothing but flimsly piece plastic glued case . it basically falls apart when you try squeeze your vision into case . 2 . there these oddly placed velcro dots armband used secure it after you wrap it around your arm . huge design flaw dots needs line up top one order secure . so , if you arm odd sign you end up make it tighter order align dots . if you're market tourniquet , then you should buy this product . 3 . if you sweat least drop while you exercise or run ( if you don't then you're not really exercising ) , velcro dots lose their stick-um . i discovered fuzzy part velcro glued onto armband . it heats up your body temperature rising , it literally melts causes dots fall off . it because this my mp3 player almost flew off my arm onto cement . so , if you looking shatter your mp3 player , then buy this nifty product . i think my son ( age 4 ) could've designed better arm band holder his pre-school class .	-1

this case works fairly well . since it semi-rigid case , it helps keep your gear pressed too much when thrown bag or backpack . i wish there bit more padding inside corner didn't press buttons much , but that not too big deal . you fit two 3-game slim cases top pouch still close case . three too snug . there no place charger , so you'll carry elsewhere . all around , well-made case reasonable price	1
these comfortable , durable , attactive shoes good price . just right office . i'm glad i made right choice	1
i ordered waterproof windbreaker , they sent zip front hooded sweat shirt . i needed item trip where i anticipated lot rain i didn't time reorder . i returned wrong item went what i which wasn't right thing either but , it better than what they sent . i'm not happy	-1
it came right time , i searching wallets on-line when i decided check out amazon.com . well my amazement , there exactly what i looking , zippered wallet snap-closure change pocket inside . wallet great , putting little mink oil it , effort soften leather . it would nice , if it more card slots , but overall i am very satisfied . gotten lot positive coments my wallet , like added little security zipper closure . anyway thanks again , think i all i needed check ( amazon.com)first , locate those hard find items	1

this my first time ordering something like this ... i concerned i would get wrong size , since i am also medium , but everything fits perfect me . contrary review below me , i personally like material , i find it quite comfortable . it lacy-like frilly not only looks sexy , but makes you feel sexy . shipping lighting fast well . i definately order this company again . =	1
i can't say enough this beguiling tee . what it lacks bells tassles it makes up simple comfort admiring glances . my favorite item late night jogs ' hood . -- laurel82	1
person metal allergies this ring must . i've received lot compliments i	1
skinny rails perfect those us who like tight jeans top bottom . very narrow bottom , but fine over sneakers . if you're not self conscious your skinny legs , these jeans you . spandex gives them stretch make them very comfortable even though they're tight . they not shrink during first wash . great dark color . perfect anti-baggy guy	1

hi im looking gold gown wear my friends party this dress perfect ! i saw dress just like this site 250 . it looks just like dress kate hudson wore " how lose guy 10 days " !	1
even though i no issue seller ( they shipeed really quickly ) i'll tell you definitely don't waste your money this garbage . i bought pair trip tahoe recently , before i even made it first run zipper split . got it back together , held rest day . second day , i hadn't even made it up first ski lift zipper broke again , permanently this time . nothing like skiing your bibs open all day . upon returning lodge , i found out one seams inside split , too . promptly threw pants out after , no sense re-packing them cross country flight ! spend your money elsewhere instead throwing it away these pants	-1
these slippers thick , fuzzy , very warm . cuff folds up keep your ankles cozy your toes ! they rubber , non-slip bottoms so you go out sunday paper without put your shoes . price more than reasonable this much quality ; not mention , choice lovely , feminine colors . i would recommend these any one	1
why some companies seem think simply adding more fabric make something fit bigger woman ? it too short , didn't flare out all skirt , halter part so long it sagged , so thin my chest fell out sides . i specifically looked models shown make sure my chest would fit into it , model white showed it would , but it didn't . i suggest buying this only if you flat-chested want something cut navel front which exposes your rear . i almost believe this designed sole purpose making heavy women cry into mirror . it possible make flattering plus-size lingerie , but i don't think this company knows how	-1
just like any apple product it easy set up , cool use , motivated me loose weight . i'm up 10 lbs . so far	1

finally , elegant attractive solution carrying too many keys around . this little purse allows me carry ten large keys car starters two separate rings , neatly close off set i don't need ( or both sets if i want ) , keep those i need handy . best all , it doesn't look like it suffer wear tear quickly causes frequently used keys work their way out standard cases fall off	1

picture it shows jacket plain black orange inside . when i got it it patches all over it saying name brand , velcro so when i pulled them off i velcro patches all over outside jacket . i take it seamstress them removed . kind material would easy damage if i tried remove them myself . i very disapointed never order them again	1
car charger wall charger work great make this combination worth price . but carrying case creative zen , while very well constructed very protective , not designed someone ( like me ) who constantly switching songs checking screen . i remove case my belt check screen because there no swivel mechanism belt clip so i view screen while clipped my belt . also , connect unit usb connector , you unsnap cover , remove ear phone cord , then plug usb connector into unit . case itself looks great , however . i just wish its utility matched its looks !	1

i've put lot miles these shoes . fact , i've using them four months . i've ran full ( actually ultra marathon ( 27.2 - lakeshore )) marathon them . they so comfortable light . solidy built . heel back part shoe feels like kevlar . sole extremely padded . shoe fits like glove around my feet . it unlike new balance shoes where you're resting your toes . i used saucony man but saucony shoes would feel flismy after putting some miles them . kayanos , after maybe couple hundred miles , they're still tip top shape . i think they could go thousand more . cons- price little reach but i figured it worthy investment because my marathon running . i feel sole could use little more traction wet surfaces .	1

shoes seems well put together never worn , because fit horrible ! why i thought buying shoes without trying them fist [ knowing my size wearing florsheims ] mystery i self-solve . these made korea [ stamped right under flap ] both pairs width wrong makers mark . stay away these no matter what price . i took them two shoe makers them stretched they said if they tried , seems would rip apart leather would crack . not comforting thought since wearing them should naturally stretch them anyway .	-1

i recently got 15 " macbook pro needed larger bag accommodate it ( replacing my manhattan portage 1640 waxed canvas messenger bag , which i loved ) . i ordered returned several things before settling this . i am very happy . it durable , smartly designed bag , pretty much perfect fit macbook pro , stored inside sleeve case . first i thought i would replace my manhattan portage bag , which just barely too small macbook pro , bigger version same bag , 1635 . but bag way too big- macbook swimming there . this bag comfortable fit , little room either side macbook when bag isn't too full . there plenty room carry number regular books ( or whatever else ) addition macbook . it also ideal number smaller pockets - not too many , not too few - storing accessories . my needs , pockets intelligently placed sized so i feel like there place everything , i don't feel like there any useless pockets . most smaller pockets inside main compartment , side opposite one that against your body when you're wearing bag . this makes them convenient access while bag . one problem i manhattan portage bag smaller pockets side that against your body , so whatever main compartment bag would get way accessing smaller pockets . since these opposite side , pockets easy get even when bag relatively full . one pockets key ring , but unlike some bags , this one attached long " leash " , so keys actually sit bottom pocket until you need them . they don't get way when you trying get other things out , but when you want them , you just fish them out grabbing top " leash " . waterproof liner essential feature when i searching bag ( i'm paranoid caught downpour my laptop ) , although this one hasn't put test yet , it seems even better than my previous bag , which always kept contents dry . one problem manhattan portage bag when flap closed there gaps top both sides , near where shoulder strap attaches . although this bag similar design , it doesn't seem same problem . i wish this bag came shoulder pad strap , but my only complaint i'm sure i purchase one separately . price amazon significantly cheaper than i could find anywhere else , so i put my savings toward shoulder strap	1
these shoes gotten lot compliments they look great jeans or capris ! only thing i order half size smaller than i normally wear it fit . they pinch poke bit around toes , but this definitely goes away after wearing it few times wearing those ' sandal ' or ' toe ' socks helps comfort too beginning .	1
i got these socks wear work , since i work " business casual " environment . i made big mistake when i bought them . i should gotten several packages same time . they're very comfortable holding up lot better than my department store brand socks ever . ( one pair those hole after two or three wearings ! ) they definitely thicker than dress sock , slightly thicker than some casual socks , so if your shoes fit very tightly , these probably not socks you want . they not thick heavy winter wool or hiking sock , however . they great my casual shoes , though , work very well my work shoes . i would definitely recommend these anyone looking socks . colors very nice , too . nice get some quality socks aren't shocking white change	1

lifestride sue slingback sandals best buy shoes i ever made . soft , comfortable , long lasting ... washable . i highly recommend them .	1
they what they're supposed do- no more , no less . i think you might want something bit warmer if you live somewhere very cold . they bit insulated , but when it gets chilly i feel it . mind you , i live atlanta , ga , so if you're colder than , get warmer gloves or some good inserts .	1
controls bounce without compression , stays place ( no chafing or strap slippage ) , great anyone who prefers hook-in-back style pull-over-the-head contortionist models . but -- seamed cups look really retro ( not good way ) under thin cotton knits like t-shirts . think 1950 bras madonna cone bustier phase	1

i wish i would these right after giving birth . they great when you wear pads all time beginnning . disposable pads thick show through your clothes . these feel really good sore nips if you refrigerate them . they not work well me when i go longer night without feeding . they leaked first couple days my body getting used 5 or 6 hours without feeding . i now give these every breastfeeding friend shower gift	1
i absolutely love this product . i nursing over 8 months now using same breast pads . no ; not just same brand but very same two breast pads i brought hospital when i gave birth . these things coolest things . long you keep them clean , they adhere breasts stop leakage just description promises . furthermore , these also great if you planning returning work while pumping/ continuing nurse . they very thin profiles smooth so you won't worry bulky/ obviously-nursing look which ruins many beautiful blouse . first i little problem getting them absolutely clean but i then i used my body glove scrub them while i shower voila ! i not tempted write review any other products i but i just can't believe more women not discovered wonder these things . possible drawback pads nature don't allow air circulation . i suggest removing them long you few hours day so skin around your nipples breathe ... removing each pad after feeding works well me but you know what works best you . any case ; take look price . that all i spent pads 8 months . what bargain even bigger convenience . kudos makers lily-padz . great shower gift too if you know someone who expecting breastfteed	1

i've always problem finding sports bra actually fit came actual bra sizes instead small-medium-large . i also hated struggling kind you pull over your head . natori one great . it comes real sizes so i never feel like i've wrapped rubber band around my chest . it stops movement while i exercise , even running jumping , without strapping down my chest . it good shape i even feel comfortable wearing it under my regular clothes . i love it hooks back so its easy get out . straps wide enough they rest easily my shoulders still provide support . it wicks away sweat . they last forever ! only thing i've ever annoyed metal clasps adjusting straps because they fall right my shoulder blades sometimes dig into them when i sit-ups harder surface . i definitely suggest this bra any larger chested women who move around lot when they exercise	1

i liked men stripe nylon suit several reasons : it nice fit , material very comfortable i liked color . however , after 2 weeks use ( swimming every day 1 hour ) , i noticed color already starting fade . i made sure follow care instructions rinsing it out after every use i never hung it out sunlight . so far , i must say material keeping its shape elasticity , just not color	1
i originally bought case logic quick-lock 320 cd case ... soon i got it home loaded it up cd , i knew it just wasn't going work , moving pages around huge hassle , you remove every page first , putting them back wasn't easy ... so ... i went this case . it binder style , so very least i knew i would able organize pages easily . this good case overall . zipper seems good , binder seems strong , but handle flimsy piece rubber stitched nylon . i bought this case storage not hauling it around so doesn't matter too much . i filled it capacity my surpise there no room add pages ... also , any large capacity binder , flipping pages not smooth action , you guide page up over , it hard flip over any more than 5 pages time . summary : pros : stylish , built well , good quality pages ( cd never slide over plastic)cons : no room additional pages , hard flip pages , flimsy rubber handlei lot shopping around cd case , i'm satisfied this case better than all rest i've looked , but i just think it possible all these companies build better cd case	1
cool shoes , every time i wear them i get compliments . people ask where i got them , i tell them i found them while traveling europe ( lie ) . quality great , something you might expect italian shoe , not japanese . only complaint i laces keep coming untied because they round nylon type , i would suggest replacing laces if you buy pair . overall i would give these shoes	1

i think i more laugh reading reviews this than bracelet could ever give me . i also find it funny someone give review product they've never used . i purchasing one these so my review justified . this bracelet take away cancer funds ? you could say yes , but then again buying soda same thing . its called frivelous spending . it mocking livestrong band ? well yeah but then again , we weird al bumper stickers doing years . some reviews , i swear i should nexy yo some them wearing " i'm stupid " t-shirt . its joke people , lighten up . oh all you worried people should donate money cause should ask themselves how uptight they get this . take it this way , i donate not care if anyone else knows , but people most uptight usually ones go up people raise thier banded arm front people go " i donated , yes i , got this cool bracelet , which means i donated " . this fad , ones most uptight this upset cause they didn't think it first . so get over scrooge livewrong !	1
i amused both bracelet reviews . such outrage over something so silly . even more amusing spelling grammar reviews . such cheap entertainment !	1
c'mon now ... those you who making fun " fad " simultaneously jumping same bandwagon buying this piece " fad " paying triple something really pure profit should look up word " irony " dictionary . i agree people should give directly charities , but if impulse purchases checkout counter web lead more money going toward charities people who wouldn't normally directly donate , i'm all it . it called taking advantage people desire part something using it some good . gee , what awful idea , huh	-1

" tab " holds two shell halves together protrudes slightly when ' pod lies flat surface , this tab tends pop open . one i've using loses it tension over matter days unit pops open unexpectedly . i'll try different one see if this just quirk one i've using . i'd also likely file protruding tab down . 040 " or so help prevent " table contact .

i purchased these jeans recently , they've quickly become my new favorites . i find it hard find jeans fit me right because i small , well-defined waist but more generous hips , buttocks , thighs ; most jeans fit my lower half large gap back waist . when i tried these jeans my usual size , 8 , they bit too tight , but when i went up size 10 , they fit quite well . there * slight * gap back waist when i wear this jeans , but because fabric hint spandex , they fit my body well enough wear without bit . spandex also makes these jeans extremely comfortable ; they hug my body nicely without feeling least bit tight . i also love low rise , which falls inch or two below my belly button , just where i like it , boot cut , which gives my short legs wonderfully long , lean look . i'm just shy 5'5 " , 32 " inseam bit long me , but i prefer my jeans longer side these days , so length seems just right . overall , these great pair jeans great price -- highly recommended , particularly pear-shaped gals like myself	1
