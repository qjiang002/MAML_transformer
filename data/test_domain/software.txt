im computer literate regularly use number varying programs visio logic audio ms office . after picking up illustrator however , im frustrated lack intuition steep learning curve software offers . ive told world revolves around 2 types people : those who " get " vector graphic programs , those who errrr ... dont . unfortunately , after 10 hours use much manual reading , i fall into later category . i dont plan give up however plan enroll course . this decision supported friends proficient its use - but who difficulty demonstrating complex concepts me . ( indeed , defining direction drawn curve intuitive metaphsyics or nuclear science ! )so my advice this : extremely carefull if youve never used illustrator before . it may breeze those well versed its use , but absoloute beginner its extremely difficult program grasp you may dissapointed find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars it .	-1
i thought this would good product my computer . i didn't know only way receive this product over internet via download . during process prompts internet download ask you remove ( uninstall/delete ) all your known antivirus , spyware , firewalls your computer prior install . this leaves your computer susceptible when you receive error message . i received error message prevented me completing download . i purchased software aug 3 called customer support , they researched problem even took remote access my computer try fix issue . they unable so then passed me second level computer technicans . microsoft guards its secrets well varying levels technical support , those know basics those know more . they asked me set up time span when i would like receive call " teir ii " agents , i chose 6-9pm . i received several calls over next two weeks , all them outside specified time . i missed several them because i career life . when i finally spoke agent they again took over remote access my computer also unable solve issue . here it , two weeks after i purchased software , i still not what i needed . i also unable surf web because download process requires you delete all antivirus firewall software . i called several times druing ordeal " teir i " agents just told me i wait call , " they'll get it when they get it . " i very upset customer support , i no idea how product , but customer support just horrible . go windows live onecare home page search " post your own thoughts " page through member accounts , you'll see i'm not alone this issue . i since purchased other software cover what microsoft says it onecare . i not one problem these installs . please aware you might purchase technical support if you cannot download due problem your operating system ( seperate onecare ) . this costs additional $35 ontop cost onecare	-1

i used ms streets trips 2005 2006 over year . it some map errors i wish updated . i read delorme street atlas far superior , so i bought it . it only took one day me find mountain problems . not only mapping way out date ( many years ) microsoft streets trips 2006 maps far more up date . many occasions told me turn wrong direction roads even when road doesn't exist direction . it doesn't even know name some very old roads displays ... " unknown name " while driving very old established roads it tells me turn onto road actually elevated overpass i am driving 30 feet below . program actually wanted me get back freeway making u-turn off ramp ramp . i used microsoft streets all these same areas it much more usable . delorme very confusing frustrating . i'm sending it back full refund	-1

i purchased quickbooks 2005 ; 4th upgrade 10 years . unlike earlier versions , this one confusing painful use . simple things like making deposits through contraptions . one reasons i upraded use online banking ; it complete disaster . it doesn't download complete trasaction details , reconcilliations very difficult . you doing twice work use it . once my transfer bank aborted message saying you low memory though quickbooks sent transaction bank , it didn't mark it internally , so next login , it sent payment again !!! it cost me $1509 double payment i am still trying get back ! how you pay bill totally messed up , there no way you mark bill paid online unless it through quickbooks online connection . ( bank billpay can't used!!)it very poor organization , you can't 2 accounts # vendor ( still 2005 !!! ) . it introduced obscure concepts items classes , which no real definition no " default " use stop every transaction . one biggest thing quickbooks hurt their customers payroll . technically you it yourself , but they hide information scare you every step you should ( must ) buy $299/year payroll service ( old tax-tables ) . all documenation , not once they mention you payroll directly this how . compared earlier products , this huge cost . reckoning i would paid ~ $2000 previous version quickbooks!!it definitely cheaper buy basic version software use accountant other work you better off . don't waste money quicken services or premium products , they bleed you death your way mental asylum	-1
i'm responsible 10 computers our organization . last year we purchased norton antivirus 2006 . it such resource hog it stopped our older computers ( 550 mhz ) working i uninstall all computers . after reading reviews said 2007 leaner , i tried install this 6 computers . only 1 install went without problems . installing three other computers took 3 days , i'm still not through computer 5 . sometimes program won't install . once it crashes during install , it leaves behind broken code prevents reinstall unless you use norton uninstall tool , which removes all norton products . so addition uninstalling reinstalling antivirus , you also reinstall norton ghost or any other norton products . computer i'm still fighting install went smoothly , but during update program hung up now i can't open norton antivirus . even worse , when i open word document , norton antivirus starts scanning document freezes computer . what nightmare	-1

new product release worthless - too buggy slow work . previous releases ok - they find some malware removed it , without interference our system . however , despite cute-sy interface , there other software programs provide same ( or better ) anti-malware support . most importantly , this company some shady business practices ( like hidden yearly automatic renewal charges , installing google toolbar download , etc ) no way contact them directly other than their online contact form which never receives response . check out better business bureau see their " unsatisfactory " report . i am currently disputing charge this company my debit card huge problems - so far i only able speak bridget their third-party billing company who says they not able provide assistance my complaint . there other , more reputable companies work . this type software not worth hassle	-1

after researching few options market i tried kaspersky internet security suite 6.0 . i needed only anti-virus but since rebates made whole suite cost same anti-virus alone i decided give it try . man , i really disappointed . out 7 programs only 2 started working properly : anti-virus proactive defense . suite trying start other 5 programs requesting reboot laptop constantly . after trying all i could i decided call or email help . this where i got my surprise - none contact information led me any live person . i emailed all addresses available net program . i called all us numbers i could - they even don't live representative here . if you try call number us canada you reach one those accept all calls leave your numbers wait all you response time . i filled out two bug reports directly program same result . one selling points anti-virus program hourly updates . well , guess what . you lucky daily update without manual interaction . i thought something wrong my work laptop installed second program ( i na�ve bought two ) brand new installation windows xp . result absolutely identical . if you don't believe me - try contact any their support ( not sales ) channels before you buy their product . my final view this product would : 1 . great idea2 . maybe great initial implementation ( reviews great)3 . unavailable support . don't waste your time money	-1

don't buy vista -- any version , yet . ms released it way too early . some examples why : * too many hardware drivers not yet available , i.e. , creative audigy sound cards ; nvidia graphics cards , linksys wireless network components , just mention few . when i contacted product manufacturers , i sensed ho-hum attitude . moreover , some peripherals totally incompatible . example : my epson perfection 1650 scanner rejected vista , so i forced buy newer model ( epson perfection 4990 photo ) . hmmmm . one wonders whether these sorts incompatibilities result more design ( purposely ? ) than insurmountable technological deficiencies . * too many vista compatible application updates not yet available . * " upgrade " versions ms vista ( versus " full " versions ) seem full bugs . soon after i installed vista ultimate , i encountered major problem ms tech support trying resolve over two weeks . it so pervasive ms outlook 2007 affected extent some its features not available . it appears during installation process , something went awry " windows event log " " event viewer . " furthermore , latest version ( vista compatible ) diskeeper 2007 pro not launch , most likely same reason . * it appears ms went way overboard security features extent paranoia . every time you click just anything , pop-up appear asking your permission " allow " it launch . very annoying , very unnecessary . it though ms adopted underlying assumption throughout development process average end user iq 85 . * ms tech support quality deteriorated substantially . most time when you call you reach someone india . albeit these people very polite , they cannot think " outside box . " nor they touch sufficiently enough nuances english language , thus impairing expeditious understanding both sides conversation . based upon my recent experience these folks , i sense soccer mom could trained ms tech support rep very little time . what i mean this : during my multiple contacts them i developed feeling they rely totally reading manuals , scripts , on-line knowledge bases . other words , they seem not able analyze troubleshoot problems independent external references . * bottom line : not purchase vista until after service pack 1 released , or whatever they happen name their first major fix-it update package . now , stay more reliable xp versions . i truly regret i discover all this hard way . it very costly more ways than one .	-1

if you look my review history , you may note i've given very few five-star reviews . i save five stars outstanding products . i believe wordperfect x3 best described outstanding . long time ago , i used word perfect . however , my earlier jobs required i use ms word , so i my best become word guru . i believe i accomplished short creating custom macros . law clerk , i started new job where wordperfect standard . so , last year i bought wordperfect 12 . first it difficult , but i bought book helped me fill blanks . ability customize keyboards fact wordperfect gives author great degree control ( especially show-codes ) , i soon able become wordperfect guru . i remembered all things i used love wordperfect . like any lover , i also learned ignore some blimishes wordperfect . ( one those blemishes behavior pushing change point document forward , which , once you get accustomed it , really nice feature . ) wordperfect pdfs two accepted file formats electronic submission federal courts . there two complaints i found work among word devotees : 1 ) ability export pdf but not import 2 ) inability cut word document into wordperfect document without creating all formatting litter word likes use . 1 . we occasionally receive pdfs we would retype able make edits . ability import pdfs ( , those authored exported into pdf , not documents scanned into pdf ) , we now able edit those pdfs . this real time saver . since pdf de facto universal standard amongst all platforms ( windows , mac , unix ) , this great improvement . 2 . formatting litter real pain deal . i never could get ms word document just import into wordperfect without headaches trying fix formatting . my solution copy portion out ms word , paste into text file , copy again then paste into wordperfect . my complaint i could not just straight paste into wordperfect . well , corel heard my cry provided ability copy just text . lone ms word holdout my office capitulated . he no more complain . great thing wordperfect fact file format its documents not changed years ( i heard wp rep say no change since 1995 ) . why should it ? everything you could want document ( perhaps barring professional typesetting ) wordperfect . there no need create new format when one you just works . this product exactly what those who come love wp expect it . i think corel good job resolving my own personal quibbles wp . so , if you're looking solid performer seeks beat competition improving itself , wpx3 representative what you're looking	1
this truly killer application comic book collectors . you get comic whole run its auspicious origins 1961 its current incarnation end 2004 , tiny dvd you carry anywhere . thrill reading classical issues all their colored glory not missed , particularly those not reprinted so far . i especially enjoyed impossible man molecule man origin stories . seeing how particular adventures ended also great fun , since i owned some comics generally undistinguished 1980s , but didn't know how things turned out . able read entire john byrne run mid-eighties spectacular . it even better than his work x-men , almost cool lee-kirby years . this so much better than essentials , since it color so much cheaper , plus it includes original ads letter pages . it also beats masterworks series not only account price , but also because it original colors . it good owning complete collection , but it take up less space hence generate less nagging mothers or wives . this must item , perhaps best price/quality ratio i ever seen . it improved ? sure . why not take advantage possibilities computers create index all characters would allow reader see all appearances character over years ? why not create index writers artists , so one may quickly get view their work ? cross-referencing next step good people marvel must working . but there no reason wait . even it , this dvd not just good enough . it great , like fantastic four themselves	1

nero 6 wonderful product , but you need get legal copy full retail version , not oem cd or cd questionable origin . this time ( april 2006 ) best place get it ahead software website ( makers nero ) .

used vista off since release first public beta , i already become familiar interface time final version came out . menu computer browsing different xp , but no less functional . i think biggest complaints i heard seem based solely resistance change . change not bad thing , many cases web browsing interface makes things much more intuitive me . many flashy effects fun play day or two , but most now turned off divert resources productivity . my computer fast enough handle it all , but i tend prefer alot overhead my processing power . utilizing system monitors , i very seldom go above 60% cpu usage , even when rendering full 3d drawings auto cad , so i would tend disagree " system hog " classification . i also tried vista ultimate slower/older machines , see some slowing down system , so best warning here heed minimum requirements . most other issues i heard seem stem driver support , there several missing drivers pretty common pieces equipment . usually beta drivers available if you take some time look , it always advisable gather your drivers together onto single cd or external drive prior beginning any upgrade . all my software worked so far , exception palmone quick install my lexmark printer companion software . vista , it solid , reliable operating system so far proven secure free any major bugs . constant updates solve little problems time goes , enhance customization features allow you tweak system get rid anything slows you down or even annoys you . overall , i would call it far more solid than any previous version windows ( including xp sp2 ) . all-in-all it easy upgrade left me very little clean-up work when it complete . those calling it " rip-off " mac osx , you've obviously not spent much time working vista or osx . there some similarities user interface , but those primarily response user feedback what desired operating system . just because ford first car manufacturer use pneumatic tire , not mean others " ripping-off " their ideas when they too began use them . capitalistic society , market demands drive product features , vista example bringing more those demands os standard pc based systems . while it not polished os some might hoped , foundation solidly laid add-ons , upgrades , enhancements security functionality come over next few years . i also feel secure knowing these upgrades service packs included price i already paid . during same time , i know i buy several upgrades my mac around $130 each . real point this : " know what you getting into before you leap . " check compatibility all your hardware software before upgrading , know what you expect when upgrade complete . if you cannot live without certain piece your total system incompatible , not upgrade til compatibility worked out . simple ..	-1

i just purchased hallmark card studio 2004 (...) . everything installed fine but when attempting print card , first side printed fine , but when printing next side i keep getting " this program performed illegal operation shut down " . i contact their technical support but not any luck so far . i wasted lot paper ink so far getting just part card printed . i am running windows 98se . i probably returning this store ( if possible ) . it looked some nice cards it , which basically all i wanted it , but some reason not print correctly my computer .	1
1 . you can't print anything over 8.5 x14 paper . useless if you want review your house any standard scale . 2 . i bought this thinking it would better than my 1993 version 3.0 broderbund 3d home architect . it turns out this exactly same software ! i strongly recommend looking something better	-1
i trusted this software would what it claimed so let down its lack performance i am dumbfounded left speechless . during backup process i selected 15gb info backup , spanning 4 dvds . everything looked fine , except two ( 2 ) simple errors i received , indicating those related files may not copied/backed up properly . i figured no big deal , 2 files/errors out 15gb , i could handle . based upon false pretenses my critical info backed up properly ( simple pictures , videos , mp3 files financial files include previous years tax files ) , i then proceeded slick my drive . remember , only 2 simple , benign almost inconspicuous errors during backup process . everything looked great . during restore process , i then received numerous errors , each them requiring me click ' yes ' when asked if i wanted proceed . i got tired clicking yes around 100 or so mark decided click no . when you click ' no ' , everything undone ; there no ' ignore all ' function so i sit through every prompt got tired it decided proceeding 1000 files answering yes would involve too much pain me . i then selected smaller group files restored , only ' my documents ' folder but ran into same situation . eventually i ran test small folder restored still ran into errors but pressed through . hardly any files received error free those issues never restored . my guess approximately 2/3 or 3/4 my files not restored course none really mattered made it . i latest update applied program , so should not cause . i would better slick my entire hard drive without going through backup process i would nearly same place but without experiencing all headaches , frustrations investment hours , no days my time . program recently purchased microsoft inclusion vista os , i imagine . it well microsoft product , it fails deliver upon its promises	-1

first all , microsoft needs come down their prices ( not this ever happen ) . i build computers living , i'd say 9 times out 10 windows single most expensive piece any pc i build . said , xp come long way . service pack 2 wonders security . i also found it most stable version windows i've used date . that not say it doesn't it flaws . it still lets it share " germs " , stops responding time time ( hangs ) , it very slow shut down . built-in cd writing software terrible remote desktop not always pleasure use either . however , biggest problem i've so far product activation . pc technician , i'm always testing new parts . most annoying problem i've after you make certain number hardware changes ( let say you replace video card , hard drive add some memory ) all within certain period time ( 180 days maybe ? ) windows makes you reactivate . this becomes problem when you reactivate twice within this period time . it makes you call microsoft , where you convince representitive you're not trying steal them . then you read them long number ( i think 41 digits ) then they'll read long number back you you need type . it driven me point using windows 2000 again test my parts , even though this isn't always practical testing xp compatibility . overall , i feel i paid too much this operating system .	1

i found this product represent extremely poor value money . i purchased product based all marketing hype testimonials . however , i since come conclusion these guys must pay people write positive testimonials . this product only covers basics ( levels 1 2 ) . then they try rope you into paying even more money their intermediate levels . i since purchased cheaper ' tell me more ' package ( spanish ) highly impressed scope it . they packed so much more value into their package . it complete package - all way advanced level . i think it really disgusting rosetta stone get away selling such seriously inferior product such highly inflated price people still buy it . i think it borders scam	-1

i've using apple macintosh systems since 1984 seen some great improvements system stability , which i consider most important aspect os . first off tiger smooth running system ( when it smoothly running ) , some nicest bells whistles around . best dog-and-pony show around . said , watch out ! this os capable completely hosing your user settings , all your software registrations , bookmarks , email settings , etc . whole enchilada . any os drop dime isn't worth time . since i use disk warrior , cocktail disk utility regularly , this should never happened . i waited until os 10.4.3 stage before upgrading 10.3.9 -- apparently it not yet ready -- best wait year before upgrading . hopefully these bugs fixed	-1

i've used paperport years mostly because it best bunch poor options . however , version 11 buggier than earlier versions : every time i launch microsoft office product , paperport installer starts up . there no reference this paperport help file or ridiculously inadequate knowledgebase paperport site . bug imprints " trial copy " legend your pdf files . this one explained knowledgebase , but requires you tinker registry correct it . that bit ridiculous . why they distributing code known bug ? nuance expects you pay $9.95 e-mail technical support - even if it bug their own product . product modest performer best , but nuance awful technical support policies real sinker here . i've requested rma refund . jerr	-1

okay ... so i'm not astute technical aspects software some reviewers , but i say my experience this software absolutely terrible . first off , it built integrate outlook , but doesn't really . it always leaves one e-mail your outbox ( one you posted first ) . if you open your outbox before they send , then one you posted most recently won't send either . seriously , only way i dealing this i left dead e-mail box permanently . if i need change something posted outbox , i open it , then get out outbox , change it , repost it , otherwise it won't send -- ever . i set nis so it doesn't scan my outgoing e-mail , it blocks anything over 2mb , my business , i send things big all time . recent update , however , it reinstated now scans all my outgoing e-mail whether it set or not . i spent hours hours phone ( supposed ) technicians , who refused answer any questions unless i disabled my whole network . what this program , i don't know . i tried " live internet chat " function , but -- i kid you not -- it took almost two hours me get ten responses guy . when i complained , he hung up me . gotta love . when i tell nis something it categorised spam " isn't spam " , it doesn't remember sender e-mail address , like it supposed . it just keeps calling it spam quarantining it . regarding spyware , i piece anti-spyware software called webroot spy sweeper , routinely finds spyware my computer nis didn't catch . this just one headache after . their customer service unresponsive totally unhelpful , not one actual solution any these problems . only piece software i ever bought anywhere close bad this winfax 10 , norton product . i never , ever buy piece norton/symantec software again long i live . they should ashamed themselves	-1

this great pda bible many reasons , several which already mentioned other reviews . it easy use , most niv study bible notes crossreferences , comes multi color highlighter ( great using different colors different purposes ... red commands , blue promises , etc . ) , you change font easier reading , it great search engine case you want all references , say " peace " occured new testament . programs come it nice well , including one tells you what read if you want read bible one year , ot one year , nt one year , many more options . i somewhat disappointed few features would made it hands-down 5 star program , though . original niv study bible elaborate introductions each book , including author , purpose , structure , much more . palm version lacking all this , no introduction all . original also many cultural information boxes all throughout bible , like description differences pharasees sauducees ; palm version not . cross references wonderful - click small circle after verse , all cross references pop up . simply click cross reference , program takes you right there . unfortunately , however , palm program no feature like " back " button gets you back original text . finding your original spot not difficult - it only takes 5 seconds little concentration - but would much nicer go instantly back same way you instantly get cross refernce clicking it . finally , i would actively marketing this product palm platform all my friends if it included all wonderful maps original - maps holyland , jerusalem , middle east , temple , others my paper niv study bible . despite these flaws , however , program joy use i highly recommend it all . i am using tungsten t3 - larger screen size make reading easier	1

ms put office 2007 dvd rather than cd so there only one disk , so they make installation easier right off bat . unlike all previous versions office , you not get into details what options you want . previous versions , if you didn't make sure you installed all features , when you went function wasn't installed , you dig out your office disks install feature . huge pain , but not anymore . installation hands down easiest all versions office . you don't tell it manually where find your files . you don't manually put your favorite buttons . it all you . yes it takes some getting use new layout functions , but once you figure them out , it so nice smooth . this version light years better than all previous versions . most impressive part installation outlook 2007 . all previous versions , you export import all your files contacts . anyone who experienced this , knows it never went smooth . sometimes it awful you lost emails contacts transfer , time it took this , very painful . this not case outlook 2007 . just load program it all transfers your previous version outlook . you don't thing , you're up running without missing beat when program loading . you shocked how simple it . anything new it growing pains learn , but once you , you very glad you made change	1

i don't like find time review stuff like this , though all vista bashing making me sick , so i feel its needed . i received vista free , through my engineering department my university . if your college check your technology website . most universities provide lots free software . however this one os i would gladly pay . i installed 64-bit edition windows vista 3 days ago . i honestly say , i not one driver or program compatibility issue yet . course i verified all my drivers available 64-bit edition before i installed vista . vista very , very stable . i not single problem yet . os surpassed my expectations , which kind low all vista-bashing i read . os looks absolutely beautiful . despite higher system requirements i see no slow down terms speed . i absolutely love sidebar , which allows me view my stocks , news , weather while my computer connected internet . everything looks better me , control panel start menu . not single compatibility problem report 64-bit edition .	1
reading cover i thought it would great product . it indeed some good items but overall this something one live without . games - bowling game actually teaser version . you play only two lanes . others cost you extra . two other games not exciting . themes screen savers mediocre . i liked analog convertor but not too much . if you get input any audio device , this program convert it into digital format . alas it doesn't convert mp3 format . also you need keep computer completely free other load while recording otherwise songs recorded slow or fast , but not normal speed . dancers provide some entertainment young kids two minutes but soon they find out these dancers canned actions . i liked ben though especially when he gets tired dancing . bottom line - i don't think you would regret buying this 17 dollars but novelty wear off within week .	-1
i bought this product after reading other on-line reviews saying how easy it use . i am someone who works computers daily this anything but easy ! it hard understand getting someone their help desk assist joke ! i wouldn't recommend this product anyone unless you're professional architect/ computer genius	-1

im computer literate regularly use number varying programs visio logic audio ms office . after picking up illustrator however , im frustrated lack intuition steep learning curve software offers . ive told world revolves around 2 types people : those who " get " vector graphic programs , those who errrr ... dont . unfortunately , after 10 hours use much manual reading , i fall into later category . i dont plan give up however plan enroll course . this decision supported friends proficient its use - but who difficulty demonstrating complex concepts me . ( indeed , defining direction drawn curve intuitive metaphsyics or nuclear science ! )so my advice this : extremely carefull if youve never used illustrator before . it may breeze those well versed its use , but absoloute beginner its extremely difficult program grasp you may dissapointed find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars it .	-1

i tried unsuccessfully several times install it . i contact their alleged support . they sent me what they deemed " fix " . fix awful . it caused my computer crash print shop would never work . broderbund used good company but i've nothing but problems their software late . they need rethink their products , their support , their company focus . they lousy this poin t.t hey obviously don't give dang quality , support , or their customers	-1

i'm midst auditioning lcd panels local isf certified guy wants $350 per panel calibrate them . i like tv everything , but there just no way i am going spend $350 tv i might possibly keep . still , store settings any two panels two problems . first , they amped up beyond compare tv vendors compete " who brightest " lit showroom floor . sitting my living room , they far far too bright watch . second , they display colors totally differently . it just hard compare 2 sets calibrated so differently . now tvs we looking cost pretty penny , it seemed couple hundred dollars inform decision good idea , just like hundred dollars hdmi splitter seemed like good idea . splitter good idea , spyder tv colormeter not so much . i calibrated 2 panels this product . two things true calibrations . first , they not look all same . sony panel red shifted flesh tones while sharp looks cold sterile . second , they look way way worse than before calibration . after 20 minutes watching casino royale , it time revert back toned down version factory defaults each . first i thought i not followed instructions right . maybe it not dark enough . maybe sensor not positioned right . process several times , i state categorically while colorvision spyder tv may not deliver good results , it consistent its delivery bad results . i simply cannot recommend this product	-1
game called fritz chesster . fritz boy . chester rat . girl you see picture , her name bianca . she never actually plays . she just says things like " well , brave knight ! " asks stupid questions . one point poor bianca points out queen strongest piece , fritz makes comment his mother chewing out his father . tone context extremely anti-woman , my opinion . he also counters saying boys smarter . it seems like makers this game really threatened fact you call most powerful piece " she " . take queen down notch , they refer group or queens harem . demonstrate how this powerful piece moves they queen run around picking flowers fast she . male voice says , " off you go , " tone which one only assume meant accompany little pat her behind .	-1

i bought this based amazon reviews . i am extremely new this but software pretty good . teacher somewhat annoying reviewer said , he sings over his playing way too much . i wish there way turn him way down guitar up . it touts over 160 lessons , but somewhat misleading . i don't doubt it over 160 pages , but i covered 23 " lessons " hour . i like fact first few lessons he teaches you very easy versions chords so you don't feel hung up doing full chords when your fingers don't want move strange new positions they aren't used . i am using this well fender dvd acoustic keith wyatt . dvd little more challenging me , but keith wyatt much better than guy emedia software ( he doesn't feel need sing !!! ) . overall , i would recommend this software	1
