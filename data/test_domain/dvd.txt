they spend first half this movie saying how great ultimate warrior . journey awesome ! then all sudden , paid wwe guys just began bad-mouth warrior . maybe he questionable judgment - but why they trying make us feel bad someone we loved ? they take some very low blows . they say warrior bad wrestler . actually he seemed just fine me when i young , i really can't distinguish one ability other . they just all gang up him make outragious allegations . vince says quickly reason why ultimate disappeared 3 years because he failed drug test . soon he says this , they fade black then come back new issue . what drug use ? which drugs ? presumably they're talking steroids . but what high mighty hulk hogan his admitted drug use . let not talk - let just keep ganging up warrior . they completely ridicule him changing his name warrior . they also just try badmouth him so much . who cares none wrestlers liked him ? i don't! he excited heck out me way more than any dorks who say bad things him -including hulk . oh yeah - they don't even let warrior defend himself . why i find out imdb.com he asked appear but declined ? why don't they address this ? this " docu " more slanted than " fahrenheitt 911 " every wrestling ultimate warrior fan start out loving this docu then hating it . it just leaves you bitter taste your mouth , tired all whining bitter trash talking .	-1
what huge disappointment this release . i suspecting it wouldn't all great when i saw studio originally produced this show , 20th century fox , same video company releasing it . well , first season looks horrible . source material all 16mm dupe prints , some parts which out focus , scratched dirty . all cases image soft , well , like 16mm . compared what fox releasing voyage bottom sea , produced same year ( 1964 ) same studio boone , this release nothing short disgrace . we should given pristine 35mm source material , we're not . i suspect fox wouldn't release original camera negs it vaults without substantial fee . anyway , season one daniel boone isn't worth buying . i haven't seen season two , when show started filming color , but i'm now afraid look	-1
i high hopes this series when i started watching it , though i guess nonstop obscenities should tip off under all visual masterwork spiritually stunning characterizations there lurked twisted message wasted ten hours my life discover . shandala truly wonderful character , pure good , characterization her very tender , so episode 21 or so storyline actually looked like it could end hopeful uplifting . oh , how wrong me think so , because all philosophical religious trappings , message " hope " marketers promise characters learn end villain demented plan save world really more effective than their spiritualities " truth " emotional physical torture destruction innocent , good woman only way save world ! spare me . if you think i am disgusted this message , just imagine what muslims think when they see what becomes all quoting koran muslim character final opinions . although story technically good , i'm only giving it one star message despair .	-1

film seems focus 70 punk exclusively . anything post-1980 glossed over , clumped together generally viewed dissapointment this " documentary " . i think film well documenting roots punk , seeing how letts steeped scene time ( although misfits weren't mentioned , which i found odd ) . interviews henry rollins jello biafra great well . however , order claim documentary , evolution punk rock just integral ( perhaps more so ) its origins . i think , basically , letts based film his own opinions , likes dislikes instead actually documenting punk . i disapointed .	-1

while this certainly isn't best pearl jam concert ever it isn't worst either . first disc starts little slow .. but you can't argue getting hear song like " my tree " " faithfull " . highlights : love boat captain ... nice opener . one best riot act song sure . my tree , one , if not my favorite pj songs . not quite rocking 2000 tour performances but still great . gimme some truth . maybe not technically perfect perfomance but heartfelt passionate . good john lennon cover . even flow . always great . spin black circle ... band starts get more into show after this rocking performance . thumbing my way ... just great slow song . breath . my opinion best performance show ... just great . crown thorns . i really like this version song ... played well whether you think ed should sing it or not . baba o'reilly . classic " who " song . great performance . just try sit still during this one . i would reccomend this dvd anyone pearl jam fan already but if you're not then i would start some their studio albums first .	1
alfred hitchcock second film after brought america david o . selznick suspicion , which he made while loan rko pictures . his first hollywood flick , rebecca , he put joan fontaine very good use ultimately these two films made her into star . fontaine won best actress academy award her portrayal lina mclaidlaw , bookish innocent ( but wealthy ) young woman who gets swept off her feet caddish johnnie aysgarth ( cary grant ) . after their quick courtship marriage against her father wishes , lina begins see johnnie who he really -- penniless leech -- but she naively continues love him nonetheless . johnnie charm ostensible , yet his irresponsible ways increasingly becoming inexcusable . lina trust eventually gives way suspicion when she begins believe he might go any length pay off his mounting debts . hitchcock masterfully builds suspense this movie manages maintain it duration picture . movie only flaw its tacked-on seemingly contrived final scene which , we told , due either mr. grant popularity during these years or existence production code effect hollywood time . hitchcock wanted darker ending but , we see here , he lost battle . however , he not give completely some would us believe . ending remains ambiguous enough allow us project either happy or sinister conclusion according our own sensibilities . suspicion classic hitchcock . grant fontaine turn masterful performances nigel bruce irresistible dimwitted loveable " beaky , " johnnie old chum . flawed ending prevents placing suspicion top any list hitchcock achievements , but it fine film nevertheless i only give it my highest recommendation . jeremy . forstad	1

story gets bit complicated because it deals little bit law issues . real problem most us get kind frightened when we face something unusual our daily lives . i watch movie end twice order understand well how bad guys going punished . i wonder what lawyers , fbi agents mafia members would think when watching this movie . most us don't know much legal issues but still interested thrillers , this movie shows rather believable very fun plot . good guy , mitch mcdeere , wins over evil not only because he smart but also because big deal good luck . mitch so lucky story strains credibility . example , mitch wife gets know all sudden gene hackman character ( who important documents copy ) not going dive mitched though so she saves days showing up distract him . well , good luck tends favor people drive real life . same time movie shows legal procedures made-up real life lawyer john grisham . movie also realistic way bad guys punished . real life white-collar criminals hardly ever go jail , even less killed good guys ; everybody knows this . what not everybody knows these crooks still face problems . movie shows sort legal money problems they get involved into . finally , suspense well organized . moreover piano instrumental music goes really well those scenes . yes , this very compelling movie recommend watching . beware this movie deals some degree conservative vs liberal cultural war . bad guys southern conservatives who want rule other people lives according their own hypocrite standards . meanwhile good guys liberals ne . i wondered how writer john grisham could portray his own southern fellows negative ways . all i guess jg realized what would accepted entertainment industry wrote according it . anyways , this just movie it what it supposed : entertain	1

what challenge ! take two characters like aliens predators invent new story could make them meet more than challenge . it unimaginable . each one better than what they before yet both together even more dramatic formidable than each one may ever . then you keep human beings real center film , those who really going transfer their fear onto us , audience . situation believable allow no single minute respite or lack tension . film-makers behind this adventure revisited their good old mythology books ransacked backshop store known � old curiosity shop � . so we revisit pyramid civilizations ( three : aztec , egyptian cambodian ) great myth all times : antarctica which all these pryramid civilizations supposed come . then they revisited all stories ranting raving some space visitors who would taught animals homo erectus species how become homo sapiens . general idea space-visitors predators , aliens prisoners pyramid two thousand feet under ice antarctica every one hundred years some young predators sent earth hunt these aliens pyramid . course some human beings accept sacrificial victims whom aliens going born , hunt . easy since these human beings old not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus . that what we told happened october 10 , 1904 going happen again october 10 , 2004 . unluckily some crazy human beings get way hunt . way lucky since these human beings set whole machinery pyramid work they become sacrificial victims who carry aliens life . course things not going go exactly way it planned predators . result absolutely perfect . human beings going reluctant resisting victims one manage go beyond simple hostility disgust help predators , hence saving world human race . details discovered film itself which spectacular . it reveals vanity human beings who get into adventure without even knowing what it all without any proper preparation . all those vain people who believe money , guns , science or whatever get end their vanity only survivor one who best prepared also least vain , so little vain her enemy my enemy my friend . this dangerous principle led many people into unbearably absurd situations incalculably lethal uncontrollable consequences . but times it safe believe it it safe practice it . though when first round finished my enemy who enemy my enemy my friend alliance defeat this common enemy goes back his basic definition becomes my enemy again war goes one more round . film-makers decided not go direction but genetically cross alien predator sequel some day few years tried tested first comic book , i guess . dvd numerous very interesting extra resources which quite welcome . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonn	-1

oscar nominee john travolta ( best actor , pulp fiction ) lovely scarlett johansson ( match point ) star this slow paced adaptation novel " off magazine street " ronald everett capps . movie features underappreciated performance travolta , who captures character bobby long perfectly . it mature performance travolta miles away any character he played before . movie pursy ( johansson ) , young 18-year old who lives florida boyfriend . when pursy hears her estranged mother lorraine died , she travels new orleans go funeral . problem , funeral few days earlier ; so pursy travels house lorraine left her find two men . one bobby long ( travolta ) , former english professor who now old drunk . other bobby protege lawson ( gabriel macht ) , who writing novel bobby doesn't seem going anywhere . pursy finds out lorraine left house two all three them , but instead leaving she decides live both men despite their misgivings . movie movies like memoir , there no particularly big events occur . it moves slowly , like life . there few turns events occur , but none them big enought warrant calling it " twist " . besides travolta wonderful performance , johansson perfect pursy . i would say this her best performance it would if not movie " match point " . not everyone like this movie , many find it dull stupid ; but this mature , sweet , fairly entertaining movie . seeing johansson half-naked wasn't bad either . i don't know how helpful this review convincing person see this movie , but i bought it 5 dollars wal-mart so it won't tragic loss if you don't like it much . grade : a-	1

i always find it fascinating when i see people praising classic films yet when i watch them , i don't know what point . one those films ended up terry gilliam brazil . while visually cool , story-wise it kind boring i didn't really care characters which course big no-no . same fear loathing las vegas which i watched sober , so maybe big difference . nearly every weed smoking/beer drinking friend i town praises film . so we come 12 monkeys which i liked it so far one my favorites he . it year 2035 5 billion people died thanks virus unleashed army 12 monkeys , group people who infected world 1996 1997 . cole , inmate " volunteers " travel 1996 obtain pure sample since it long since mutated hopes engineering cure . however they sent him 1990 even worse , his rant ravings future viruses mankind near extinction gets him thrown nuthouse . what erupts there quite enthralling sure keep your brain their toes ... so speak . one thing i always love these kind films how certain things future get explained such literal writings wall phone messages it gets involving mentally , maybe bit too much so . while i didn't get confused , some scenes probably just fly over people heads leave them disoriented . especially its ending which i won't spoil while i figure it out what it , other parts i'm like " hey wait minute , what ...? " bruce willis , well maybe mark wahlberg orlando bloom , what i call " william hurt " factor : no matter how good their performance(or bad case bloom occasional wahlberg ) , they always sound so bored . however , this film arguably one bruce best . surprisingly it also one brad pitt , playing jeffrey goines , man who , box puts it mildly , few cards short full deck . then there madeleine stowe who i always liked films she but i rarely see her . while there other actors film , such david morse christopher plummer , it primarily these 3 get center attention . while i wouldn't necessarily buy 12 monkeys unless someone bought it me , it certainly quite enjoyable film its own right	1
" con express " lots action it , which great because this hides poor writing uninteresting characters . unfortunately , action isn't enough , stunt pieces shoot-outs , audience tempted doze off . city heat productions isn't really known producing films highest quality , so usually i go easy them . if this big-budget company producing this , i'd inclined pan it entirely . but i wasn't expecting much got little more than i bargained . action , most part , pretty good but nothing competitive your usual dumb action movie . flanery vosloo perfectly casted , but everyone else seems stiff add any more flow movie . vosloo especially appears enjoying himself over-the-top bad guy hijacking train containing deadly chemicals . film moves fast contains shades better movies like under siege 2 , con air , spy game , speed . if you liked those , you probably won't mind this one too much . just go easy it	-1

before i review , i'd like clear something up : i am very latecomer seeing this movie . i introduced ghost shell franchise through new anime series airing adult swim , ghost shell : standalone complex . i absolutely love show , so i figured eventually i'd get around seeing movie , which i knew full well shares no connection show . they're both seperate interperetations comic series same name , ( which i not read , so i don't know which more accurate ) but tv series exponentially better than this movie almost every concievable way . there many things i don't like this movie , biggest poor pacing . plot movie actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all filler , but that biggest problem . there not really enough story last full-length feature , because it seems almost like it originally written intention 30 minute short . since they didn't budget load movie up action scenes ( there barely any , they aren't very impressive most part ) they slow story down drawn out conversations you won't understand more than 60% , camera shots last what feels like minutes where we're looking either nothing , or woman nipples . that not cinematic artistry , that either lazy or perverted . animation itself isn't even good , especially considering this theatrical release only 10 years ago . it choppy , there not really whole lot detail ( except when it comes women nipples ) . looking just animation , if i didn't know better , i'd thought this movie ova 1980 . only thing i really say i liked this movie it ghost shell . it probably kind like how i didn't see 1989 batman movie until years after i'd spoiled batman animated series , couldn't bring myself like it any reason other than it batman . everything tv series superior this movie : animation , stories , character developement , production values ... i could go entire page how much better tv series . short , if you're you're all interested gits franchise , yourself favor rent dvds tv show instead . you'll find lot love , but i can't say same movie . my dream someday alex proyas give us gits movie lives up what i would hope after watching standalone complex	-1

i really liked this dvd . hard it watch all painful memories it brings flooding back into forefront consciousness . callous cold hearted indifferent nastiness reagan administration those it considered lesser americans lay hospitals suffering dying . this dvd shows dr gallo shallow man vaccuous heart lacking anything remotely akin human compassion unless course camera rolling . film shows cdc headed political hacks who elevated collected arts administrative spin control , reckless indifference suffering \ death people it not like stonewalling stuff mythic legend . while dvd shows ugliest demons human heart laid bare whole world might see it also shares most humane tender moments early days before hiv / aids got those names . film showed how even one america darkest hours when true presidental leadership asleep switch , little people those deep inside government all they could protect public health living up highest standards onr called offer themselves service our nation . dvd simply told truth it left pretty much viewer make up his or her own mind what they think those times . there some moving facts end dvd all now quite dated . i guess thing caught me so totally off guard running tally showing numbers sick dying people earliest days epidemic . it so sad how reagan adminstration so viciously sat its hands doing nothing while so many died epidemic it might not stopped but it might slowed significantly it only acted same fortitude home it mustered beruit or libia . yes i dwell too much sickening aspects those times because just seeing it again after lived through it makes me mad . seeing this dvd just convinces me we real leader white house when aids hiv grid gay cancer first burst onto scene things might not so grim . but this dvd so much more than venom pain loss it also highlights human kind its best . there much love this dvd balanced grim realities day . back day i not say i front lines , because indeed i not . i think this movie must anyone collection its current price it not beat . course i brought copy might buy spare lend out teaching purposes . this dvd pretty accurate hiv history it should told	1

what filth . what utter tripe . if early 90 didn't enough " white people bad , everyone else good " movies , comes this sick , unimaginative , racist garbage . i see ratings many viewers like this movie ( some whom appear unable spell most primitive words english language offer ) . let me ask you wannabe vatos locos this .... if this movie white people instead latino people , would you thought this movie racist ? think it ... white people starting gangs street prison based principle outkilling outbreeding other races people ? oh , but when non-white people it , suddenly it not racist . more bs hollywood double-standard bigoted drivel . way , how your vatos locos movement doing ? hmm ? it producing successful members society , or just more fodder prison gang rape ? exactly . you racist , degenerate losers back then , you're racist , degenerate losers now . though i doubt you'll ever learn . vatos locos forever ! ha ha ha ha ha what absolute joke . what insult humanity . grow up	-1
after his devastating demolishing m.a.s.h. , altman returns very smart picture . you should not forget how altman totally involved certain premises considered untouchables ; he made splendid film titled mccabe mrs. miller 1973 eventually he would round off his fabulous " three women " 1977 , considered his most bergmanian work . magisterial use country music just attractive facade explore carve relief lot basic profiles american people . there so much see analyze underneath . solid film became loved cult film since its immediate release .	1
this " movie " , which obviously meant pilot but aired stand-alone feature , lacks nearly everything made babylon 5 great show . it set same universe contains same races ships , but plotting feels like , well , failed pilot . g'kar scenes " rangers " embarassment character . after spectacular sendoff original b5 series , he re-enters universe apparently regressed two or three seasons ' worth character development . there no reason him present except spout off some gratuitous quotes babylon 5 remind us we watching b5 show . overall , this show would without much value if it stood alone . episode b5 mythos , it worth even less	-1

critics lambasted kirk douglas ' performance " hammy " . i don't see all . this , without doubt , vincent van gogh we read " letters theo " miraculously brought life . van gogh actual life , whole thing kind creaking bipolarity it ; he periods creative bliss , happiness fulfillment , but they too short his almost unbearable intensity gets him into trouble too often too many people who help him . anthony quinn paul gaughan would seem like strange fit , but he pulls it off pretty well ; you feel arguments crashing them like thunderstorms , vincent unwavering belief their friendship so innocent enthusiastic one cannot help but feel heartbroken when it ends so terribly . douglas communicates vividly what we suspect van gogh reading his correspondences , his paintings ; he far too visionary ever really make it practical world , or overcome his restlessness long enough allow his art mature . beginning film more than any other sequence shows how violently alienated van gogh coteries social mores . his doomed-from-the-start mission minister ends ironically -- he too christian christians . while there explosion underground poverty-stricken children die very miner who introduced him their real hellish existence , he reprimanded his spiritual " superiors " dressing incorrectly . van gogh so enraged this he screams just what he thinks them , loses all chance path life . throughout film he remains christian , but he too much self-absorbed passionate artist always retain his ethics . douglas ' van gogh stick no situation or person very long : only constant thread his life his passion painting . sometimes performance so good we feel van gogh landmine madness coarsing through screen even empathize those who reject him because fiery nature could really scary times . we get chance see van gogh paintings way we never before , which probably best part this movie . his relationship his long suffering brother theo , played superbly james donald . he should gotten nomination best supporting actor , not anthony quinn , who turns roughly same performance every movie happened get lucky this one . somewhere inside him he knows his brother genius , but he still flesh blood van gogh deal financially otherwise . ending could not remotely powerful it without him . this film , despite concerning man titanic imagination , also good realistic attack myth tortured artist something romantic envied . barring his moments vision , van gogh life hell sorts led him miserable death . this nothing envy or emulate this movie communicates . still , beautifully must see anyone who wants understand one greatest painters ever live .	1

we're deep into formula now computer animated films -- over hedge one most tired bunch . anyone say buzz woody ? chicken run ? exterminator stock villain cgi movies -- almost identical vintage toy collector toy story 2 . how many times you a-bomb joke ... worse still dialogue , painfully unfunny one-liners , see-saw animation either dull or like pinball machine sight gags explosions . it clear each these animators trying outdo one , once again we see cleverly-disguised lack locations -- or interest . there must nothing easier craft render than endless rows geometric homes single proscenium forest . this film by-the-numbers piece merchandising very little genuine artistry .	-1
longtime fan batman comics , i definite ideas what batman movie should . i am pleased report batman begins pretty close my definition good batman movie - it certainly first incarnation live-action batman i would recommend friends . story - millionaire heir bruce wayne witnesses his parents deaths hands mugger . he ends up wandering world looking purpose comes across formidable enigmatic ra al ghul , head centuries-old organisation dedicated cleaning up corruption decadance ( they claim caused sack rome , example ) . he trains variety martial arts , returning gotham city ( fictional city " nyc nj " ) start his life crimefighting . his first target - mob kingpin carmine falcone . his second mission - save gotham ra's mad plan raze city example world . true batman fan , plot not so important execution . luckily designers batsuit understood batman not tank plods through badguys , but stealth fighter than surgically picks off baddies one-by-one , maximising fear remaining undetectable . same token , this batsuit flexible enough bale use martial arts moves not look awkward , unlike his film predecessors . similarly , new batmobile humvee-like military vehicle obviously take damage thrown it ( opposed suped-up corvette ) . also vital importance batman story incorporation his origin surrounding minor characters . just recent spider-man films incorporated large cast supporting characters pinned his personality his origin story , so too this batman film . this gives it richness depth vital its believability ( if such thing even possible superhero film ! ) . i especially pleased see big-screen debut lt . gordon corrupt bullying partner , det . flass . similarly , gordon himself , alfred , ra , scarecrow ( jonathan crane ) , etc . all used good effect here . unfortunately , there some nitpicking problems film . starters , where this character rachel ( played katie holmes ) come ? there perfectly good d.a. batman mythos ( harvey dent ) , why invent new one ? similarly , if female character needed endangered , why not vicki vale ? surely investigative reporter get into much trouble crime lord d.a. could . missing character ra's daughter talia . finally , ( spoiler alert !! ) batman fans very upset his greatest nemesis ( except possibly joker ) dies end film . fans comic know ra immortal - perhaps talia drag his body back lazarus pit revive him ? we actually see liam neeson again ? biggest complaint i , though , balance action detective work . me , batman sort cross bruce lee sherlock holmes . this film gone entirely bruce lee side left out sherlock holmes . granted , young impetuous batman would probably prefer busting heads careful csi-like forensic investigation . i only hope overseers warner bros . don't fall into trap making unending series action films , which would quickly get boring . detective work , if well , would welcome necessary aspect maintaining interest franchise . this special edition set most interesting due inclusion comic book . it contains few stories different eras batman comics , give reader overview evolution comic character . dvd extras themselves pretty standard only mildly interesting . they include featurettes new batmobile , development batsuit , etc	-1
labyrinth delightful movie fantasy fun all ages enjoy . this always one my favorite films , going back it adult only makes me enjoy appreciate it all more . jennifer connelly gives superb performance sarah , main character , whose baby brother taken goblin king ( david bowie one his best characters - who ironically gives often sensitive human performance while fanciful fantastic same time ; he wrote performed all music , which also some his best work ) . sarah must leave her world make-believe enter very real deceptive labyrinth save her brother time before he turned into goblin . way , we encounter large cast jim henson puppet-creatures , some which become sarah friends helpers her journey . puppets so believable you soon forget they not real people . movie filled magic , both off screen . film supplemented this dvd " making-of " documentary - original feature , narrated largely jim henson himself - made during actual production film ( released 1986 ) . such documentary makes one appreciate even more what goes into movie like this how complex creatures - what goes into their creation , how they operate , how they interact sets other characters ( especially this case live actors ) . it lot fun see this " inside " look , more than anything gives real sense who jim henson how much this all really meant him . my favorite quote jim henson this documentary when he said ( his inspiration motivation when he makes movie ) , " when i go see film , when i leave theater ... i like happier than i when when i went , i like leave up feeling , i like picture sense substance , life things matter me , " - wonderful sentiment remember this day age . lighthearted , fun , fantastical , funny , beautiful , exciting , more " real " than many today " realities " - extremely enjoyable uplifting . added bonus , monty python member terry jones wrote script ( interviewed documentary ) . cheryl mcfadden ( star trek : tng beverly crusher ) also all choreography film ( both humans puppets ) . : -	1

i high hopes this movie . alas it wasted sentiment . it started off very s-l-o-w . it great premise . aging don juan gets mysterious letter saying he son .... he may looking him . so off he goes journey . but ... murray possibly more complete stone face ? his complete total lack any emotion appalling . i kept waiting this charming , charismatic man who seduced woman after woman pop out . nope . i thought this comedy/drama ? no comedy . no drama . fact everyone this movie acted such stilted restraint this movie it painful . very unrealistic . people not act this way .... conversations time spent each woman he once " relationship " or one night stand ( we never know they never once talk anything much ) boring again unrealistic . if someone i not seen 20 years showed up , i think i might couple questions , some animation . either it anger or surprise . one other thing this movie . it feels claustrophobic . tight . constricted . scenes drag forever . shot him sitting his couch staring 2 min . shots him driving down road ( many those ) horrendous jazz playing ... dragging minute . just constant boring listless shots . it got point if i knew what he going next- say go over his neighbors house- i would fast forward ... knowing it would boring drawn out walk over there . i never ff through movies , this one demanded it . this really horrible movie . i wasted over 2 hours this only end .... total dud . bleck .	-1

i am one many reviewers who purchased this dvd because everyone favorably compared it " seinfeld , " ( not hbo subscriber ) i never seen it . personally , i found this show boring , repetitive , often grating . well , that just me . you might among many people who enjoy this genre comedy . deciding if this dvd you require informed assessment you own taste . buy this dvd if you tend laugh protracted bickering among characters ( " married children " or vicki lawrence show " mama " ) . this not kind gut-splittingly funny politically charged bickering we once enjoyed " all family . " " seinfeld " , you see adults act childish , selfish , irresponsible , uncaring ways . depending how this , it very funny , but " curb " missed mark me . i find self-absorbed new yorkers ( those portrayed seinfeld ) funny , but self-absorbed californians ( " curb " ) just pathetic , not even laughable . you might feel differently . neurosis rudeness backhandedly ridiculed " seinfeld " , but almost celebrated " curb . " characters " seinfeld " roughly half generation younger than those " curb . " seinfeld characters ( who came age " me " era 1980s ) commit variety hilarious middle-age gaffes mis-steps associated lack direction life . older characters " curb , " other hand , offer us only repetitive uncreative barrage antagonistic behavior characteristic people who given up forging new directions life . they merely exist . you might find this funny , but i found it depressing	-1

sum things up , this really george lucus film-with then relatively inexperienced ron howard hired direct-under watchful eye lucus . lucus wrote screenplay , raiding his bookshelf tolkein ( especially " hobbit " ) lewis ( " narnia " ) . then he simply transferred hero/heroine romance his " star wars " screenplay . not necessarily bad thing , it simple way him build feature length screenplay targeting younger viewers but sophisticated enough entertain entire family . " willow " some scary stuff but should not problem average grade school viewer . my rating based comparisons other films similar target audience . i must confess up-front positive bias . my favorite part " star wars " caustic romance han solo princess leia ; " willow " lucus refined his technique actually improved something already close perfection . sorsha ( joanne whalley ) madmartigan ( val kilmer ) substitute nicely carrie fisher harrison ford , added dimension them begin story opposite sides . romantic elements efficiently subtly inserted into film . even though these characters part main storyline , romance separate enough serve film main parallel story . only downside this side story soon becomes more interesting than main one , so much so its climatic kiss ( occurring 20 minutes before ending ) unintentionally turns into film climax ( least energy wise ) . actual resolution main story then plays out rather anti-climatically . " willow " delivery quest story , much like " hobbit " where reluctant nelwyn ( small person ) required set out perilous journey return lost baby ( even smaller ) daikini ( tall person ) . way he assisted couple brownies ( yet smaller guys who speak outrageous french accents ) . size differentials main theme film especially intriguing young viewers who easily identify deal people who tower above them . howard encourages this identification process shooting most action child level . if you watch film young children you amazed its ability draw them into story , this happens because camera angles intentionally match child point-of-view world . viewing child surrogate title character ( warwick davis-who commentary dvd ) , unlikely hero who inspires audience sympathy he bravely faces dangers his journey while gamely putting up ever-changing group irritating companions . there frequent cutaways elora danan ( baby ) , mostly reaction shots . " raising arizona " , producers took enough stock clips match her expressions almost any situation . willow learns early cherlindrea ( dazzling fairy ) elora danan princess who ( it foretold ) one day vanquish evil queen baymorda ( fun role jean marsh ) . things get bit biblical/narnia here queen seeking eliminate princess before she becomes threa t.t he dvd features : " willow : making adventure " ( made during production 1988 ) " willow : morf morphing " ( made 2001 dvd release ) , really put film historical context relative its place evolution special effects . it really transitional point where photochemical ( film ) effects subordinated digital effects . this gave " willow " significant place film history these two featurettes taken together nicely illustrate continuing challenge those involved special effects ; any new development soon overused no longer audience draw . meaning effects people stay cutting edge simply justify their existence . then again , what i know ? i'm only child	1
french pedagogy differs american , so american viewers should not expect american classroom french accent when they watch " " ( " etre et avoir " ) . despite differences style language , however , film powerful because it taps into reservoir universal experience . adults sometimes idealize childhood . maybe they really perfect lives youth , but more likely their memories short . " " recaptures not just innocence sponteneity childhood we idealize , but also uncertainty , need accepted understood , need sometimes difficulty understanding , influence family , importance wise caring teacher or guide . children positively endearing , very individual . some stars ; others struggle . george lopez , instructor , soft-spoken reaches his students ' minds through their hearts well intellect . one things struck me early film how effectvely he reached through his students his quiet wisdom steady hand tiller . quality cinematography editing also excellent support film beautifully . ( i would give this movie 4.5 stars , if option available . ) highly recommended	-1

klaus von bulow ( played jeremy irons ) inject his wife sunny ( glenn close ) insulin cause her fall into coma or not ? originally convicted , this appeal case reversed decision . close narrates film her coma state , ron silver plays hot-shot lawyer alan dershowitz non-stop energy . movie very spirited captivating although it revolves around legal case , it not really courtroom drama since very little it accurs court ; instead we see silver aides scurrying around like chipmunks gathering their appeal case data . course , weight movie lies irons , rather cold , mysterious man who may or may not telling truth . legally he gets off , but we're left impression morally he may guilty . movie compelling we're watching , but , strangely , i found images scenes movie quickly evaporating after it over : it no lasting power . irons won oscar his role	-1

harvey keitel stars fbi agent this dark death-filled tale gangs london . premise simple one , one we've seen many other mob movies . older , established mobsters code honor try things proper way . rash , up coming punks care nothing honor just want quick cash drugs . this case , it american - carl frazer ( played viggo mortensen ) who causing trouble . fbi sent john harris ( keitel ) help london police force shut him down . carl truly psychotic drug / arms dealer who loves gather up lost but innocent young men , tell them they special , then turn them into cold blooded killers . carl gets his thrills corrupting virtuous . there many comments throughout movie - both cops old time mobsters - how these young , sweet kids their lives destroyed drugs lure cash . one scene , old mob guy attacked two these ' kids ' who trying kill him . when he turns tables them , he refuses shoot them - he just tells them leave him alone . i admit i bit issue this constant referring adult men " kids " - they appear their early 20s , they out drinking , working , lives . it always tragic when someone led astray , but call them helpless " boys " or " kids " marginalizing their maturity , my mind . maybe if they'd made boys movie 13-15 age range it would played better me . any case , movie little cardboardy . you crooked cops . keitel hard-fbi-guy-who-is-still-tender . mob guy rough but tender too . viggo over top psycho who smashes prostitute face party because she snorting coke instead doing her job . his main lines action only let him show ' moralless insanity ' without many shades anything else . keitel got lot good moments depth his role , tough bad guys , really caring innocent , wrapped up knots his home life . great role provided craig kelly - he great young man ( oops i mean helpless boy ) who first tries avoid getting sucked into situation , but finally make some hard decisions . violence end , there lot it . there also lot loud clubbing , meaning either your ears blown out noise or you're missing soft dialogue because it muddled . i usually don't any issues all sound balance dvd so i really find it odd how mix here . maybe part intention - make you feel like you didn't know what going immersed this throbbing london scene . great movie watch once - either rental or tv - before you decide if you want actually own it	-1

i never bought vhs tape , but when i notified this would coming out dvd , i ordered it . while i'm not amateur , i am professional , eric guitarist guitarist . anyone who thinks he don't need learnin ' fool only famous his own little world , small it may . i'm not arrogant . danny gatton known humbler , eric johnson could rightly called inspiration . what he not so much difficult it epitome finesse transparency technique . after viewing this , you understand what i mean . i already know much what eric teaches this session , what it , private session ( much like you might get git ) , master top his craft . but there always something learn even after repeated viewings . i even scanned booklet comes this so i break lessons down blow up individual charts more easy reading . if you serious improving player , if you're looking real professional , you need get this , if only see what true professionalism looks sounds like . lessons clear focused . booklet new ability slow down examples , you really learn play these things . but don't expect sound like eric ( just those who tried , but could never sound like jimi hendrix ) . you different so always sound different , that plus . but techniques all included here part " must learn " program you need create follow if you want least make good living playing music . learn master melody technique , where technique doesn't get way melody , but lives service song -- way it should . i teach , too . i recommend any student who wants grow they should get this dvd . if you get no other , this would serve whatever style you choose pursue , ultimately , because there so much here applied virtually any style , whether it jazz , country , blues , rock or even acoustic ( which i wish he would included segment , my only kvetch )	1

me , roger waters ' explanations themes behind album highlight here . he seems think deeply life , but also able express his thoughts simply eloquently . i'd imagine he would made top-class psychologist if he hadn't taken rock roll path . he definitely aura leader , defining piece it direction , while other band members seem content talk musical aspects album , well circumstance its making . this valuable too , its own way , rick wright seems especially good describing his influences music-writing process . there also good input alan parsons chris thomas , well occasional long-haired jounalist giving their commentary album impact . there some on-stage footage , but don't expect too much ; this , after all , documentary making album , it stays well focused task . bonus material exceptional ; highlights include roger waters demo tape " time " radically different finished album track , david gilmour giving some virtuoso solo performances . its hard imagine how it could much better	1

" paradise now " one first post-september 11 films terrorism i've seen it one most overlooked powerful . saying it overlooked isn't completely accurate , it nominated best foreign film academy award it won best foreign film golden globe . most people won't see it though , because it arabic english subtitles . movie two palestinian men named said ( pronunced si-eed ) khaled , who see their life like prison they can't get out . both these men long paradise , whether it real or just their head . so two men join group martyrs , bombs strapped their bodies , begin crossing into israel commit suicide mission tel aviv . it not so one-sided though , movie kind sidetracks ... soon said khaled cross into israel , they separated . khaled gets back martyrs , while said begins wandering around realizes mission his fate he can't change it . movie pretty insightful looking motivations terrorism ( like critic john anderson says cover , although i'm paraphrasing ) ... but , same time , i think most terrorists don't think way said khaled . movie isn't likely offend anyone offended films like " world trade center " or " united 93 " because it terrorism , but not same kind portrayed those films ( i haven't offended any film i've ever seen , so this just opinion ) . even if you're not into reading subtitles , this haunting important film should seen people . this movie potential shown classrooms some point . world where politics make you win oscars grammys ( michael moore , rage against machine , etc . ) ...

i go ahead try break down each disc really memorable moments . every episode certainly something you remember , say great score show , or exta great voice acting batman or guest star , or maybe it one storyline you remember where you seriously thought it thriller , but i try point out some little things this show . course i like 9-10 years old when this show started , but it odd how show gotten better after not watched it around 12 years . disc one- this one my favorite batman episode , movie , whatever , perchance dream how bruce wayne wakes up his parents alive , he married selina kyle , he not even batman , it perfect life . or it ? batman his most thrilling moment this episode . robin reckoning really good serious episode . good conflicts good guys . this easily best disc this volume it also one joker most psycotic episodes-the laughing fish , ninja episodes also get started this disc . disc 2- cat scratch fever one my favorite lines series , batman commenting catwoman fever feeling her head says " you're hot " , catwoman- " now you notice " . hell yeah catwoman hot . heart steel freaking great episode which takes lot bladerunner , which definite good thing . if you're so smart , why aren't you rich episode which i always personally watch one my top 10 batman episodes . it great part where guy so afraid go sleep he goes bed holding shotgun under his blankets . joker " wild one very rare non-great joker shows . i didn't like tyger , tyger all much , one 2-3 episodes i didn't really care , but hey , still better than any cartoon today . disc 3-i said earlier disc 1 best one this maybe but this one tied . moon wolf- tjis great robin college episode scarecrow back up his evil scarings . day samurai- ninja series continues . terror sky- super , great , extrafragalisticexpialidocious episode , serious , yet kid campy funny too . almost got ' em- this episode great example why i love this show . it really takes you back 50 one best humor shows also crams like 5 stories single episode still manages beginning spectacular ending . birds feather-great showcase penguin . what reality- good riddler episode great end level type bad guy . i am night- very emotional episde revolving around commissioner gordon . disc 4- great one all 7 good 6 classics . paging crime doctor ver touhcing episode . harley ivy wonderful episode might chick episode but still us guys too . zatanna always one my favorite characters she knows who batman , i see her coming back future episodes . i left very memorable line top off all these outstanding episodes . man who killed batman , bullock says no make-up , blond hair harley- " don't i know you somewhere " , harley- " i believe i served you sepina once , it small sepina " . absolutely classic . so overall this better than volume 1(no disrespect ) , if continued this fashion , could gone down greatest show ever , but everything come end sometime , right . also i got this mart(nebraska furniture mart ) 26.99 brand new .	1

honestly other reviews it right when they say you should buy yourself hd dvd player buy this movie . it looks amazing , sound out this world film very good , boot	1
tootsie complicated film say least . actor perhaps too much pride his art his own good subsequently alienates any director he ever could've hoped work . he needs finance his friend play , but he can't find work . obvious solution : disguise himself actress get part daytime drama . wrong hands , this could've played out like daytime drama , but smart dialog , careful direction , brilliant performances give film clever grace raise it above trappings its plot . watching dustin hoffman obliviously speak out against his own discretions force us somewhat reevaluate our own views gender . i can't think actor who could've pulled off character , even those who given great drag performances ( i'm not referring wayans brothers , case you wondering ) . bill murray also achieved brilliance roommate who his best take everything stride but thinks maybe " we're going into weird area here . " eighties-ness might little much times ( i little dumbfounded hearing my mother sing one musical interludes next room ) , but this film entertaining it contrived . it doesn't logically work ( i'm little curious how they wrote hoffman character off show after his secret revealed ) , but film this inspired , who cares ?	-1
such incredible energy !! musical genius makes it look so easy . he truly loves play sing rock ' roll it shows . his band also best . insrumentals very complicated but fogerty his group up task . not one dull moment this entire dvd . i highly recommend it .	1
i'll admit i thing sean patrick flannery , but he only one reason i love this movie . this like paperback romance bundled up into lowbudget tv movie . loved it	-1
i just got into asian films , especially japan . daibosatsu ( its title japanese ) amazing piece film , which won adjective " classic " . original thing sword doom , ryunosuke ( principal character ) , kind psycho . he almost never expresses any emotions always talking cold , slow , heartless , monotone , emotionless tone ( only twice he laughs eerie thing listen ) , simple , if-you-said-the-wrong-thing-i'm-going-to-slay-you kind way . guy doesn't even blink . he doesn't care if someone wants kill him . he kills old man just because . story around end tokugawa shogunate , when old order falling apart birth meijin restoration hand . although not necessary , little bit knowledge period help appreciate this movie . b/c , but it helps movie . one things i like best it shows what real swordfight using katanas would look like , not fancy metal clashing against metal hollywood , europe some asian(including japan ) movies . movie strange sense you don't develop any emotion ryunosuke , even when you know he lacks few marbles . simple , he just , you accept tha t.t he story simple , man expel fencing school , challenge match ( pay attention , match , no duel ) , winner become heir school when sensei dies . can't tell you much , ( match turn into duel ... ) simply he so neutral , so amoral , makes him dangerous . his own father wants him dead . he joins shinsengumi , but his lack emotion , together his disregard bushido ( well , not always , but enough piss off hardcore samurai , even those times left interpretation ) , gains him hatred his assassin buddies . ( i highly recommend you read shinsengumi ) . movie great , simply , yet deep . story man obsessed improving his swordmanship , no matter who or what he ends destroying . buy it , i usually tell people rent movies first but i doubt you get this any rental . but don't worry , if you like samurai movies , you like this one . unless you hate enimagtic endings ... which me , it makes story even better .	-1
even though this dated material , corrs , their prime , unique entertaining band . talented fun-loving , they music " hooks you " . almost every song sing-a-long-able , ( new word i created ) . special features , also , help educate their fans or fans-to-be their style inspiration . but , music needs no introduction . it deep , pop , danceable . like abba . there not one song i skip over , after repeated plays . little over-edited , video keeps moving . picture leaves little desired . fans engaged band become part experience . fun watch their reactions	-1
unlike many reviewers here , i'm not biblical expert really don't care if movie adheres stories they portrayed bible . i would just judge movie based its entertainment value ability engage me emotionally . biggest problem this movie it simply seemed too long drawn out . there also some scenes felt like padding added nothing story ( some cases detracted it ) . instance , during long voyage while earth covered water , everyone goes bit crazy . that acceptable premise but it played out theatrically far too long variety embarrassing scenes actors . idea they suffered madness fine introduce but it shouldn't taken up so much time nor quite so adbsurdly plotted out like little play . there also couple ridiculous encounters water ( lot acting pirate merchant who sold them various trinkets water ) which undermined entire story great flood . everyone supposed perished flood it bit absurd few would sailing high seas little boats . it just plain silly , again , seemed put just pad story or add unnecessary " spice " ( it didn't work means jazzing up story ) . i'm guessing writers felt time water long show how noah his family suffered or their faith tested but they also felt it more interesting than just lounging boat taking care animals . this type insecurity telling story most effective way what causes so many productions go bad . movie credit , actors quite good there some good moments but too much movie doesn't work .	-1
i bought this movie my wife . she loved it	1
me , this film matt damon , brilliant newcomer who came out ( seemingly ) nowhere . i floored his performance - one best 20th century . course he supported fine cast - robin williams , ben affleck , loveable minnie driver , whose onscreen chemistry damon sizzling . matt emerald heap cheap diamonds , obviously multi-talented guy - he co-wrote screenplay well starred it . well worth seeing .	1
i don't expect anything more movie than enjoy it entertained . i don't seek psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique , it only movie . i either enjoy it or i don't . this one still cracks me up ... marty feldman hilarious , there some corny humor , sure , but it highly enjoyable	-1
it only one competitor so far " air america " .. but air america cannot stand repeat viewing ... i watch this movie every 4 months still bein stitches ...... this definately " mans " comedy ... women not find it funny most men !!! but my opinion it still remains funniest comedy first decade new millenium . ps why doesnt amazon spell checker different fonts/size fonts ??	1
definitely , season 4 columbo winner replete number excellent episodes provide hours enjoyment . " exercise fatality " robert conrad owner string health clubs who murders his partner , " dawn early light , " military school commandant ( patrick mcgoohan ) who murders trustee who wants convert military school co-ed community college , clearly best lot . what fascinating columbo not only quality writing pacing episodes , but remarkable cadre top tier actors appeared show : jack cassidy , robert vaughn , dean stockwell , george hamilton , john cassavettes , oscar werner , lesley ann warren , robert culp , leslie nielsen , janet leigh , gena rowlands name few . if you buy only one season columbo , make it season 4 . unfortunately , only extra dull completely unnecessary episode ms. columbo " caviar everything . " still , no interviews or extras clearly leave columbo fans disappointed hope future boxed sets something more enticing watch -- even episode ridiculous " a-team " would more welcome than ms. columbo . address problems many other amazon reviewers experiencing their dvd sets , i say my set works just fine no malfunctions . i might suggest keeping your dvds their plastic sleeves refraining using them coasters when not use might help . if doesn't work , invest better dvd player .	1
this delightful romantic comedy very engaging main actress ( marguerite moreau ) . after spending years " jerk magnet " , she quit dating scene when lo behold , two decent guys real potential come . like they say , " it never rains but it pours " . she then faced opposite problem deciding which guy would better choice . while watching it , i didn't really know how things would turn out because both guys she into actually quite likeable . fortunately everything ends happily . well it romantic comedy . :) i thought customers might want know specs this dvd seeing amazon continued its bad habit omitting tech specs newer releases . dvd screen media films . it it original aspect ratio 1.85.1 ( enhanced widescreen tv ) . colors accurate . there quite bit film grain but not too distracting . my only quibble presentation black levels closer dull grey so transfer lacks sense depth richness . soundwise it 2.0 5.1 surround pretty decent sound reproduction . there no close captions or subtitles contrary what it says backcover amazon . all all very enjoyable movie . definitely worth viewing	-1

simply stunning flick hd dvd . considering early reviews downplayed difference standard dvd hd , i wasn't expecting such incredible image ( some hd dvds aren't much improvement over regular dvd ; see serenity ) . this disc i'll throw whenever i want show someone what hd dvd all . movie , this what sci-fi should : daring way over top . after pitch black , who would thought riddick story would taken such epic turn ? i don't know whether it ego trip , creative cliff diving , or just return " old school " sci-fi where writers created new myths , unique worlds , bizarre technology ( tread dangerously toward embarrassment coining their own vocabulary -- it get any better than " underverse " " necromongers " ? ) . i hope it latter , but it doesn't matter . just enjoy ride . all tired sci-fi thrown us hollywood , it great something fresh given us . forget what you've read critics fanboys out there ; chronicles riddick real goods . great hd dvd	1

but things really changed much since late forties ? this gem movie neglected classic americana . " letter three wives " uses many same talents who made " all eve " such hit year later , most notably joseph . mankiewicz writer/director celeste holm , who present here voice only addie ross , town flirt . just three town more prominent clubwomen depart day-long trip underprivileged children , they receive note addie -- she run off one their husbands . they whole day think which one it . jeanne crain character insecure because she left her iowa roots married up one town gentry . linda darnell character " shanty irish " married department store millionaire whom they share rather grudging relationship . ann sothern plays radio screenwriter who trying maneuver her way out second-best neighborhood town into very best . sharp observations class social climbing small towns/suburbia , this film sharp writing acting some genuinely funny moments , including star turn kirk douglas droll english teacher ( bet you thought you'd never see him comedy ! ) . look wonderful thelma ritter maid wrong side tracks . all all , " letter three wives " great entertainment welcome addition any video collection . i seen my copy several times introduced it several people .	1

mention name roger moore average moviegoer they'll most likely immediately associate him james bond franchise . makes sense me . after all , moore took up mantle thrown down sean connery eventually made some seven bond films , beginning " live let die " 1973 ending " view kill " 1985 . i'm partial roger moore because this very fact . he definitely my favorite bond ; i enjoy his glib wit , expressions fear when confronted daunting situations , just way he handles himself onscreen . i never turn down opportunity watch one his films when amc or channel runs yet lengthy 007 marathon . it natural , considering how much i enjoy his bond films , i would seek out other roger moore projects . thanks dvd , we're starting see his work " saint " several other efforts reemerge . i'm still waiting " wild geese " , up until short time ago , i eagerly awaited arrival " ffolkes . " finally , i procured copy immediately sat down watch . i wanted see if i liked movie much i ten or fifteen years ago . " ffolkes " story rufus excaliber ffolkes ( moore , course , lower case last name some reason ) , crusty old tar who runs mercenary security service his retirement . you could say this chap sort gentleman businesses turn when they need top-notch security . you could also say governments might turn him well when faced threats not easily deterred conventional forces . , my friends , exactly what happens when terrorist named lou kramer ( anthony hopkins ) hijacks two british oil rigs north sea . technical assistance nerdy looking harold schulman ( michael parks ) gang muscle , kramer rigs platforms high explosives then sends his demands london . predictably , prime minister ( faith brooks ) her cabinet outraged . tendency not negotiate terrorists , however , places government real bind . fortunately , certain insurance concerns -- quite agitated destruction rigs could bankrupt firm -- call rufus excaliber ffolkes save day . it sort task he his people relish , kramer carefully prepared plans demand intellectual well physical response . it tough assignment made all more difficult stormy , cold region . ffolkes rapidly coordinates his plan attack help admiral sir francis brindsen ( james mason ) . outfit manages remove one rigs danger quite quickly easily , but second one bit harder since kramer his thugs float right beside it small boat . kramer emotional state deteriorating fast weather outside . nordic crew ship , led captain olafsen ( jack watson ) , resents their kidnapping kramer constantly irritates terrorist . this cautious defiance , coupled grinding process negotiating british government , soon wears heavily kramer . he oscillates calm explosive rages , always inches away detonator blow rigs sky high . vast majority film takes place boat nearby rig , ffolkes disguises himself british naval officer hope he board ship part negotiating team bring evil kramer down . needless say , plan doesn't go quite smoothly hoped . ffolkes british government save their oil production facilities nick time ? watch see . moore great this movie . he plays no nonsense sort guy set like stone his ways . misanthrope penchant cats , needlepoint , love scotch , loathing women runs core his soul , ffolkes makes interesting character . played roger moore , he hilarious because we immediately realize this guy far james bond one could get . less compelling , least hardcore action film fans , pace content movie . picture one talkiest action movies you're likely see , even when action breaks out it not enough tide over fans big body counts massive explosions . there also several moments incredulity where viewer likely say , " no way . would never happen ! " but that o.k. i like moore so much , i always enjoy watching anthony hopkins go off deep end , i forgave director writer not giving us non-stop action flick . but if you're sort filmgoer who eschews character development tension favor cartwheeling bodies stuff blowing up , you'll likely chafe bit this movie . i'd like give dvd presentation film five stars . i'd like , but i can't couple reasons . one , nary extra graces disc . nothing . nada . zip . not even trailer film . ouch ! i don't know why " ffolkes " received such shabby treatment , but it undeserved my opinion . second , probably more germane actual film , i didn't enjoy movie quite much i when i saw it back when i younger lad . like i mentioned vague way above , i encountered several unbelievable situations scenes during my latest trip through movie . yet " ffolkes " still great , still lot fun , definitely worth seeking out not only bond fans but moore fans well .	-1

stnj , clandestine government organization , employees tasked hunting down capturing witches removing them society . ostensibly , this keep them becoming menaces they recognize begin use their powers . when one their own taken away witch , young italian raised nun , robin , sent replacement . she quickly proves adept hunter , takes initiative hunting , proving herself invaluable team . viewed action title , robin seems episodic , " monster week " feel it . but watching this series carefully , you realize , just storyline , not everything it seems . witch hunter robin excellent gothic mystery , full symbolism , twists , turns , clues . characters develop throughout , not one same when character introduced . robin grows changes through series , she learns many things stnj , her often shady co-workers , her own mysterious pas t.t his title deals witchcraft , subject offensive many . initial portrayal all witches evil should removed society . series deals its own demons demonstrating there many forms evil man visits his brother , addresses paradox fighting evil evil . characters themselves often struggle what good evil when witchcraft involved , giving show vividly realistic feel . those concerned violence or nudity , there violence , but it not gratuitous , it used only advance story demonstrating various witches ' powers . there no nudity . robin seen bath her shoulders up time time . this title definitely worth seeing , again again	1
completely honest , i fooled first episode this series . it so light-hearted innocent i couldn't possibly suspected what come . then , series got , i began understand dark undertones this series , i got feeling i watching something more than simple " alice wonderland " adventure . story follows young boy named shu , brash kid enough energy share ten people , he finds himself strange , desert world ( this starts after first episode ) after battling save blue-haired girl some mysterious , robot-piloting soldiers his home town . this world , away where he grew up went school , shu instant odds leading force here , must not only battle save lala-ru ( blue-haired girl ) but keep himself alive well . ultimately , he ends up prisoner mad king suffers terrible tortures until king satisfied shu knows nothing more than what he admitted . so , shu becomes one child soldiers king army . still , he simmers circumstances his enlistment , eventually makes his escape . outside influence king , shu meets group people who only ones capable putting up fight against mad king , expected , shu decides he should join them . naturally , terrible battle ensues which shu becomes involved . story now then , here there , continues get more more dramatic every episode begins ends , new characters introduced lives lost , it becomes easy get so deeply involved this sentimental violent story you actually feel emotions . it just well , through through . now then , here there compares green legend ran lot ways , but much better my estimation . it also lot similarities some early miyazaki films , such nausicca castle sky . note , though , my recommendations go older audience , not younger audience target miyazaki films . yes , this animation innocent look , but this story definitely isn't younger audience . thirteen may too young , but lot worst happens ( including rape torture ) implied so make it little better . fifteen or higher would better , though . either way , this great box set own , it very cheap ( thirty bucks entire series ) all original material found during now then first dvd release . plus , it powerful anime dramatic , plot-driven story .	1
there something heartbreaking listening people no sense humor explain , resolute logic , why something isn't funny . unless you're unapologetically homophobic , which case you don't deserve fun , there just no reason why you wouldn't delighted this minor masterpiece . forget movie , all you need premise start laughing . australia , widely known most macho place earth , three drag queens go epic journey inland ancient bus named priscilla which routinely breaks down most inconvenient times . while lip-synching abba tunes blaring boom box hardly strikes me art ; combination costumes , wigs , make-up , attitude , dancing required create drag show group aborigines impressive very least , if not heroic . it seems me mrs. doubtfire , tootsie matter , projected level awareness scrubbed so clean it would home love american style . priscilla , contrast , strikes perfect balance . it madly over top hilarious , reveling sheer absurdity outrageousness it all . but it also warm , never patronizing , more characters get know each other more you get know them like them process . there difficult choices end movie , loss . then you really care . all three leads terrific , but terrence stamp standout here . invisible craft he delivers bravest performance his career , it real nuance , not easy pull off when you look like cher . certainly kind film one would qualify " cult classic , " well worth owning . just thing take off shelf when you're starting take yourself too seriously . y-abba-d-abba-do	1

this film true story . it important you know because some facts reactions seem excessive , yet ... it all starts bunch rowdy black kids who run across older white man , local personality who starts playing these boys ten or eleven these boys decide fight against it , probably without knowing what they fighting against , except it not correct let older white man touch you if you little black boy . local police justice officials go road leads same boy who arrested � molesting � older man triple death sentence triple murder he never committed never investigated properly . film absolutely outstanding because it sets emphasis this black man , ex-world champion boxing , transcending this fate getting so high his meditation he truly free prison truly divine his mind . this hurricane thus set example model anyone whose freedom endangered , we move 15 year old black boy brooklyn who buys reads rubin carter book booksale 25 cents . his own life series accidental cicumstances lead him deprevation among alcoholics some achievement � host family � canada . this black boy , lesra , identifies rubin gets involved his case . his canadian guardians get this involvement they eventually bring truth out convince federal court man innocent released prison immediately . what important here how these people react organize their search how it succeeds thanks some nearly immaterial circumstances go their way not simple automatic habitual way . it such cases justify people thinking there hope our societies where poor cannot any justice all because they cannot afford good lawyers very start , later it too late : initial damage rarely redeemed , yet some cases there prove it could , even if it not most time . this one films should studied details all high schools all over world . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine university paris i pantheon-sorbonne	1

beautiful job dear people warner ! all films included nicely mastered fine prints , but " sweet bird youth " seems little pale shade too dark . no disaster , though ! my only real complaint two more tennessee williams films owned warner left out box . some people upset titles like " boom " " summer smoke " not included . how could they possibly ? they owned other companies . warner home video issue films made mgm warner bros ., but not those owned universal paramount . but ... warner rights " glass menagerie " " period adjustment " ! why these not included this box mystery ! so please , warner , not forget issue them soon possible ! some good universal paramount regarding " boom " " summer smoke " , tennessee willams list films would complete dvd ! well , i suppose we campaign " last mobile hot-shots " too	1

it very disappointing see major actors , cinematographers , editors doing good job decidedly sub-rate material . film looks much , much better than its story . one begins doubts when this family " geniuses " reveal little intellectual heft conversation interaction . paltrow character virtual cipher whose only talent seems finding stashes her cigarettes , despite her promotion " prodigy " . purported love triangle no apparent basis , other words , audience told accept premise without evidence . problem this film written people who not professional , creative writers . characters must shown " interesting " , " conflicted " , " in-love " , " suicidal " , etc . their words actions , not simply because we told they . this only accomplished subtle clever writing , which wholly absent here	-1
i would rate this piece film trash " 0 " , but unfortunately , not available option . this stupid movie not start scene , but it contribute it . this review all you ghetto monkey morons who think because you ground effects obnoxious sounding muffler , somehow you transformed yourselves into mario andretti ferrari ; i some astounding news you , average citizen thinks you idiot license , should barred ever contributing human populus . no one impressed your driving antics endanger rest us roads highways . fact , everytime i read one you idiots died tragic accident due your own ignorance lack driving skills , i actually celebrate my friends , we relieve ourselves grave , because there one less stupid person road . rest world favor , save your money , don't make your car look stupid ghetto , which return , makes you look stupid ghetto , learn how drive safely , turn your hat around ( facing forward ) , pick up your retarded looking baggy pants , put belt , hide your underwear , ( no one wants see , but laughs you while you walk past ) speak normal language includes words besides " dawg " other non-understandable neanderthal sounds clearly indicate your lack education stupidity	-1
what superb cold-war action flick . it all-star cast , all male , many who became stars later . sean connery captain ramius new super sub " red october " . his stature legendary among all soviet submarine captains , but his lithuanian his wife died year earlier while he sea . he no children . officer crew sub hand picked him almost all men who personally loyal him . jack ryan here played alec baldwin one his best roles . he brilliant cia analyst rather than field officer knows submarines . because what develops , he brought cia chief admiral greer ( immortal national treasure james earl jones ) advise national security advisor pelt ( wonderful too soon lost richard jordan ) . there great deal confusion what americans , soviets , various crews various ships know . we , audience , know actual situation , but we concerned who learn what before or after it too late . what i like most this movie while there some heroics , they aren't superman kind stunts show up too many action flicks . people try what they it doesn't always work out without cost or even all well . end , well , you already know or should watch movie find out . i want single out terrific courtney vance sonar genius jones , scott glenn commander mancuso us sub dallas sam neill soviet captain borodin - 2nd ramius . fine performances each . even though ships big , shooting movie such confined quarters risks tedium claustrophobia ( which work film if handled well ) . this film focuses faces shows us people talking small groups so we see emotion their faces they struggle understand what going what should happen next . enjoy	1
even though this film released 1985 , now , more than 20 years later , it still highly entertaining . you get least few moments each character , develop feel them , come like them all . you really want see them succeed , suspense whether they or not constant . this movie good all ages , rated pg . cyndi lauper " goonies ' ' good enough " song nice touch . richard donner steven spielberg created magical movie enjoyed years come	1
i never read any tom clancy works , but i seen all movies made them . patriot games one them . storyline quite simple : jack ryan ( harrison ford ) , former cia analyst , vacation/lecture tour england his family . while way meet them near buckingham palace , he his family caught cross-fire during assassination attempt member royal family , lord holmes ( edward fox ) , rogue faction ira led sean miller ( sean bean ) . ensuing shoot-out , jack killed one terrorists , who happens sean younger brother . jack gets drawn back into cia after terrorists set out vengeful attack against his family back usa . my view , action sequences this movie not very exciting , when compared any recent bond /or bourne movies , although entire movie quite entertaining . i particularly enjoyed sequence showing real-time satellite-tracking session cia hq , during which jack his counter-terrorism team watching crack sas team conducting black ops raid terrorists ' hideout somewhere libya . accompanying music score realistically haunting ! what excites me most this movie watching jack exercising his astute power observation his uncanny ability juxtapose images relentless attempt track down whereabout rogue faction ira ,... high-tech resources cia counter-terrorism group , course . using vital information secured paddy o'neil ( richard harris ) , ira supporter usa , jack narrows down search through his observation/juxtaposition cia satellite images ( which includes overhead snapshot apparently capped woman pony tail ) his own recalled images : - back-view glimpse pony-tailed driver terrorists ' getaway vehicle during foiled assassination attempt england ; - side-view glance pony-tailed driver terrorists ' getaway vehicle during unsuccessful assassination attempt his life outside us naval academy ; all these associations triggered while taking break walking pass pony-tailed woman employee way answer call nature cia headquarters . what brilliant piece detective work - observation plus juxtaposition - part jack ! power observation juxtaposition obviously requisite character traits cia analyst . summing up this review , i enjoyed very much watching patriot games , experientially well educationally . this wonderful addition my resource repertoire	1

" green mile " expertly mixes film genres : it part prison flick , part supernatural mystery part drama . it adapted sephen king novel director/writer frank darabont released 1999 . if you're not admirer stephen king books/films ( i'm not ) don't let deter you viewing this beautiful-and-spiritually-profound film ; " green mile " no means typical horror story , although it couple horrific scenes . story : tom hanks plays head death row guard tennessee prison during depression . new inmate introduced , hulking black man named john coffey ( exquisitely played michael clarke duncan ) , who condemned death rape murder two little girls . hanks his guard friends slowly become intrigued seemingly pure-hearted giant begin realize he eminently gifted decidedly supernatural way ; they conclude there no way he could guilty crime . if that case , who guilty ? guilty party get away it .

i haven't seen 1937 version fred astaire , or 2004 version richard gere , but i don't really feel need see them now . this movie absolutely great . it very similar tampopo . after seeing this movie i checked amazon , they share their main actor ( kji yakusho ) so maybe it not coinceidence . shall we dance tampopo both someone changing their lives trying become proficient certain area ( dancing noodle cooking ) , both cases main characters older man younger woman , both movies tender japanese comedies satirize movie conventions japanese culture . difference tampopo , older man motivating training younger woman , shall we dance it younger woman who motivates train older man . yakusho plays role man stuck japanese work rut , who sees beautiful pensive woman window dance school every evening when he passes train . so he decides enroll able dance woman . way , it changes his life , way he sees other people , changes her life well . i especially liked fact conflict his wife handled realism tact , instead screaming fits " you're sleeping outside tonight " we've trained expect american television . real relief . which movie best , wow ! i can't decide ! tampopo little more substantial , but both wonderful . i'm going agonize over which movie nudge off my top 20 put this one	1
okay , i remember early 90 when nbc beating other networks hits like seinfeld , friends , this bigtime drama . well , this probably really big hit drama during early 90 no one forget . now , i don't recognize today er cast people seem more hollywood than struggling tv actors . so , this first season really defines heart drama tv which giving chance those struggling tv actors really shine . well , i guess george clooney only one break out er big success . others managed get out when scripts ran out steam after 4th or 5th season . well , dvd treatment this season pretty standard . although i would prefered nicer box set individual cases . anyways , dvd package fold-away stack double-sided dvds . yeah , this probably save cost so price would affordable . it annoying super careful but hey , fewer discs end . menus pretty much simple use some discs extras . my favorite looking bloopers final disc . also , interviews cast nice see how actors remember fondly their times er . picture quality episodes first rate seems almost perfect it tv . i don't any complaints transfer since everything looks crisp . so , there no overly dark scenes which difficult see . plus , audio well but i wished there english subtitles . sometimes , doctors , interns , nurses speak too fast action you want catch part their dialogue . this major letdown me since this should standard all us released dvd general ( tv , movies , etc ) . overall , this keeper i would recommend this watch again . you really get heart disciple-pupil relationship carter benton well some funny fiascos deb chen trying please benton . plus , dr. ross nurse hathaway plot full complications which more soapy stuff daytime . but , writers balanced it off operating table i think this season probably best my humble opinion . it makes me think if doctors watched er regular basis , then they would realize humanizing part doctors understanding patient what we really appreciate . well , i just hope my doctor turns out like susan lewis rather than peter benton	1
director david cronenberg creepy well . this may because he seems little creepy himself -- like stodgy , corduroy-wearing history professor who appears totally harmless but secretly likes handcuff women bedposts then place live tarantulas their naked torsos . i doubt director quite extreme , but it kind perversity colors most his movies , especially those made late ' 70s through 1980s . cronenberg second feature film , " rabid , " straddles horror sci-fi ( many his movies ) its story young woman , rose , who , after receiving some experimental skin grafts following horrific motorcycle accident , develops need human blood ( given rose played marilyn chambers , one might even say quot ; insatiablequot ; need blood ) . but it not your usual modern day vampire tale . starters , rose doesn't sprout fangs but rather orifice her armpit resembles inflamed sphincter , through which phallic looking proboscis emerges punctures victim . after which victim generally starts foaming mouth attacking whoever handy . before long , montreal under martial law its citizens become , well , you know ... though not cronenberg best movie , " rabid " holds up his later works like " scanners " " videodrome . " despite low budget , " rabid " some relatively convincing special effects , dreary location shots ( made drearier dank weather ) help establish overall feeling desolation . epidemic martial law aspects his story quite relevant today , if he'd played up plastic surgery angle bit more movie would triply prescient . ( imagine if " rabid " made today , then he could get cameos such surgically reconstructed celebs joan rivers , bruce jenner michael latoya jackson . ) cronenberg script lightly peppered his silly sense humor ( plastic surgeon named dr. keloid ; health minister advice avoiding rabies : " don't get bit " ) , but material played so seriously jokes dry irony rather than overt goofiness . still , all its merits , " rabid " probably wouldn't received nearly much attention it not stunt casting porn star chambers ( al adamson tried similar ploy when he cast georgina spelvin " i spit your corpse " ) . she actually pretty good this movie . commentary track cronenberg wonders why chambers didn't go star more mainstream movies , but this fact doesn't surprise me . even today , when ! entertainment channel regularly profiles porn stars , adult performers usually only cast mainstream movies joke or give low-budget films publicity boost . chambers may proved she could more film than just sex acts , but mainstream hollywood she'd always " just porn star . " extras ventura special edition disc not only include cronenberg commentary but 30-minute interview well . there also theatrical trailer written bios cronenberg chambers . wished chambers provided commentary well ( she even asked ? ) , but her absence hardly detrimental this dvd package . definite must fans david cronenberg , marilyn chambers low-budget creepiness .	-1
yes ! boy meets world great television series rest seasons brink not released absurd . if they don't want mass produce them then they should still let people special order them	1
this film masterpiece - certainly best cartoon i ever seen , one very best films any genre - period . film stars family superheroes - parr - who forced into hiding because series ridiculous lawsuits ( bob parr : " i saved your life ! " , suicide guy : " no , you ruined my death ! " ) . crazy fan " i know all your moves " , who irritates bob point blunt rejection . ejector seat - spoof bond goldfinger movie . evil madman ( " syndrome " - set conditions pointing type disease ! ) owns island called " no-man-is-an " , many other jokes . it also fun contrast hilarious attempts family blend ( daughter violet : " normal - only one this family who normal jack-jack , he not even toilet trained ! " ) dangers they later face . bob longs days hero again , see him contain himself just hilarious , yet sympathetic same time . its interesting see them develop confidence , learn use their powers new ways . finally , i enjoyed seeing them learn work together family - transitioning mundane ( borderline dysfunctional ) formidable team . " jack jack attack " short movie disk 2 fits main film , also hilarious . early bond-style band music also suits film perfectly - even outdoes it . it could appeal some kids who attention span follow story , but i think it more appeal adults who admire creativity craftsmanship . worth multiple viewings . worth every penny	1

" fishing john " makes fun fishing shows while still actually fishing show . it mocks itself much it form . it aimless yet knows full well what it doing . it brilliant it never really tries . these contrasts just few reasons why " fishing john " such great watch . six episodes may not seem like much , but really it just enough , any rate , price certainly right	-1

" king marvin gardens " example why seventies such golden period american filmmaking studios well stars would take chance offbeat material regardless it box office potential . director bob rafelson creates haunting story disparate souls who cling hopes faded atlantic city facade they inhabit . jack nicholson effectively plays against type radio personality who joins up his brother(bruce dern ) partake his latest get-rich-quick scheme all earmarks going up flames . they joined ellen burstyn faded beauty queen who ride futile hope attaining dream . this film not easy watch times but more ambitious viewer appreciate filmmaking dares challenge it audience . gorgeous cinematography atlantic city landscape before casinos erected .	-1

" dirty rotten scoundrels " classic comedy , driven beginning end crafty characters created michael caine steve martin . storyline addressed extensively other reviewers , but i add this film definitely breaks mom old rule : " don't make fun handicapped . " not only martin caine characters both morally handicapped extreme , but martin gets play not one but two handicapped characters he works his cons : one wheelchair , other ( ruprecht ) .... well , i don't know exactly what ruprecht handicap , but i understand why he kept locked up his room . finally , this movie lovely look it , allowing you take fantasy trip french riviera , stay finest hotels villas , sip best champagne - that step up most movies these days right there . no explosions or violence . amazing .	1
ab bootcamp part billy blanks newest ( circa 2005 ) tae bo series , billy bootcamp . i've tae bo fan two years now , own many his early dvds , including original 4-pack , tae bo ii : get ripped ( still my favorite ) , ultimate abs/butt , ultimate upper/lower body . while i love early stuff , tae bo workouts he produced since switching studios ( ventura distribution good times entertainment ) seem more stylish , but considerably less difficult , than his earlier work . i especially disappointed tae bo cardio tae bo capture power series . however , i found myself growing bored what i , so i bit bullet bought tae bo bootcamp series . i'm happy say i don't regret my decision one bit ! unlike other bootcamp workouts , ab bootcamp not require " billy bands " ( pair elastic bands loop around your feet hands , thus adding considerable - almost impossible - resistance your workout ) . thus , you purchase this one dvd its own not worry buying extra equipmen t.t he workout runs 35 minutes length - boy , oh boy , what butt-kicking 35 minutes it ! always , billy starts out some stretching warm-ups . next up calisthenics , including series squats pelvic thrusts i've never seen tae bo before . class also spends good amount time horse stance ( squatting , butts thrust towards floor ) , arms up , torsos twisting side side . this really allows you concentrate your abs work waist . billy introduced this particular exercise many previous workouts , but never this much depth or such long period . you really feel your abs legs working here . finally , it down floor series crunches similar ab exercises . thankfully , billy mixes it up bit allocates some time stretching , which definitely takes edge off more extreme ab work . i've only ab bootcamp five times now , but i already notice difference my abs . i'm adding this one my regular rotation , no doubt . since it also slightly shorter than many other dvds i own ( 15 20 minutes ) , it good those mornings when you're running little late but still want squeeze decent workout . must anyone who wants work their abs ( who doesn't! ? ) . five stars all around ! - kelly garbato , tae bo junki	1
forget days when incubus simulated sounds rage against machine , korn or red hot chili peppers their post-grunge days . incubus moving forward their own brand originality , making " alive red rocks " must see . " fungus amongus " ( 1995 ) brought world funkier version rage against machine . 1997 " s.c.i.e.n.c.e. " huge step forward . although they jumped into whole rap-metal mess limp bizkit korn , record much more endearing , mainly due fact band hip-hop influence came dj opposed brandon boyd ( singer ) . " make yourself " ( 1999 ) showed incubus really settling into their sound , reminiscent red hot chili peppers ' funk-rock style , sounding much more comfortable than their past efforts . it also their most successful mainstream hit date . lessons " make yourself " definitely apply their follow-up 2001 release " morning view " , where they ditch nu-metal/rap-metal sound focus expanding sounds " make yourself " . " crow left murder " marks their most significant welcomed change years . you don't get sense incubus sounds like other bands this record , it simply sounds like incubus ; fresh , original mind-blowing . if you like myself , welcoming change artistically growing band , not whining how they should return rap/metal days " s.c.i.e.n.c.e. " , you just gonna love this dvd ! everyone band pulls their weight flawlessly this concert . every member gets their jaw dropping moments shine show . brandon boyd never sounded better , hitting those highs , lows everything cleaner clearer than ever . ben kenney ( former roots bassist ) shows why he definitely man job , turning out gnarly bass solos , sweet drum solo percussion jaunt featured " vitamin " . jos pasillas shocked hell out me his killer drum solo also featured " vitamin " . he much more talented drummer than i first thought . i don't even know where start guitarist mike einziger . i've seen two other incubus shows dvd , mike baffled me this time . he always fantastic guitarist , but you never realize how good he actually until you hear him belt out solos songs like " priceless " " sick , sad little world " . i awe speed , timing precision he displayed . since incubus " jam band " side them , those solos get stretched out like mad , making it even more enjoyable than album versions . one main reasons i bought this dvd see how well mike would able pull off solo " sick , sad little world " ; you not disappointed . this definitely incubus ' quintessential live performance . no die hard incubus fan would missing this dvd their discography	1

this film its place " ground breaking " idea . it comedy placed , subtle genuinely funny . some films , such star trek , trying come up warped ideas 100% time . good food-for-thought , but it get tedious towards end series . i truly enjoyed watching groundhog day 2nd time , which probably enough any film - otherwise it starts become groundhog day our own . after first time i came away feeling whole purpose our hero win bedroom conquest . second thoughts it not so gratuitous ( mainly because it isn't overdone ) . but it still seems strange it aim whole plotline . why can't they simply fall love then groundhog day over	1

i own vhs tapes this series enjoyed it very much . it beautiful visual effects shows much personal lives astronomers . it would even better if carl sagan , most lively interesting astronomer our time , involved making this series . unfortunately , he not even appear any episodes . decade passed since cosmos series , sagan , perhaps because health reasons , apparently unable contribute his talents this project . but it very compelling series since you see work astronomers very personal perspective . graphics animation attractive appealing use best technology available time	-1

i liked but didn't love first two mi films . first artsy but somewhat convoluted not well-paced . second exciting extreme , but bloated , pretentious ( e.g. signature john woo doves ) lacking any sort subtlety , we've seen other woo films ( e.g. face/off ) . mi :3 feels completely different than its predecessors , thanks writing directing jj abrahms , creator " alias " " lost . " you see his style all over this film . best way describe mi :3 this : first half like really , really good episode " alias , " but $50 million budget . second half like really , really good episode " 24 " , but $50 million budget . if you like both these exciting tv shows , i am pretty sure you like mi :3 lot . i know tom cruise lost lot folks ' goodwill , couch-jumping hysterics , his totally out-of-line comments brooke shields ' post partum depression , other high profile screw-ups . it would totally understandable if you didn't want bother his films anymore . but i respectfully ask you cut him little slack , just 120 minutes , just long enough enjoy this film . it worth it , trust me !	-1
i first saw this movie high school theater . i extremely moved film , it triggered facination south asia lasts this day - i even work half year sri lanka now . so me , personally , this movie tremendous influence . i understand arguements crediting non-white actors ; i always wondered why candice bergman given top billing , given she only appears very few scenes . well , that way world - it marketing right or wrong , get people into theater you highlight those who well known . it not right , but that hollywood . i mean , better unfair credits than not movie all , yes ? you've got admit , it quite debut ben kingsly . wow . he'll forever known this role . aside , this excellent , amazing film . course , it still highly relevant , perhaps even more so our post-911 world fear . movie ends feeling real hope inspiration . must-see anyone who feels anger , fear , agressively nationalistic , hopelessness , hatred , or lost . i think several politicans who need see this movie	1
if you're going parody countless number straight teen comedies , least make your movie funnier smarter than they . this movie neither doesn't credit its audience any intellect whatsoever . i nothing against lowbrow comedy , but jokes gags here just plain tired . over-douching yourself point constant crapping funny anyone over age 12 ? jokes gerbils nambla - c'mon . i know i'll get hell taking my gay self too seriously , but gerbil jokes nambla equated gay offensive . maybe if their respective jokes funny i'd feel differently , but they anything but . just stupid . if there redeeming factor this movie , it attractive actors , but that really it .	-1
absolutely great ! i love this movie when i saw it here i get it . delivered quickely . no damages . overall 5 stars	1
well , my kids really enjoy this movie . they actually sit through whole movie they only 2 3 1/2 . i don't want make too many comments adults because i'm sure most adults aren't going buy this just themselves . i wouldn't recommend but if you looking movie please your kids then i'd highly recommend this movie . i think all kids up age 8 or so would enjoy this movie . basically story this little boy all sudden finds he hear everything dogs say . supposedly there planet out there made up all dogs hubble boy dog just sent there grade dogs earth . so , like i said this movie i'd recommend kids but adults might think it little far-fetched .	-1
first , let me start off saying i think casting choices this movie perfect . i doubts movie would any good , because i'm not exactly fan jennifer lopez acting , but she brilliant job playing her par t.t he movie great sensual dance seens , substantial , interesting storyline go it . i'm addicted dance movies , anyone who says dance movie older people it can't good definitely wrong . richard gere amazing . this movie rocked	-1
its own terms , this movie winner . why it totally true history or not , actors today cannot this believable . performances universally convincing . made 1985 , why it everyone this movie put their heart into their performance , thus i mesmerized delighted . when you shed tear these young people caught up tragedy political manipulation , it no more than tears these young actors , so convincing so deeply rendered . how i wish i could own twenty films like this one !	1
what it don mckellar why you keep seeing him movies ? he represent some sort canadian triple threat like orson welles usa ? all through two hours childstar i kept wondering casting agents who said , " perfect fit our don mckellar ! " those you who don't know who i'm talking , he every canadian movie manages cross border us -- so called " nylon curtain . " he little bit like woody allen , his constant stream backtalk non sequiturs nerdy intellectual appeal . except don more fit , almost like real star , good figure hint hard muscle . opposite him , jennifer jason leigh more appealing than i've ever seen her movie , she beautiful too , almost though she some sort plastic surgery soul , how old she now , she still young , but she gorgeous here driven " stage mother " determined prove old cliche wrong . her little boy , taylor brandon burns , huge us sitcom star who acts up fictional show called family differences son omnipresent but goodhumored alan thicke . toronto lures him promise big screen glory " first son " ludicrous action movie aimed tweens which he gets save entire western world drive fighter plane rescue dad , potus , cabal evildoers who him tied up riding chair air force one . if " first son " more entertaining than tired satire childstar , who says you choose ? you get both movies you get more them than you want , anyhow . i like , wtf don mckellar , but now i know he good me . sign me up whatever club he stands	-1
i thought movie great ! van damme not getting any younger he getting older well maybe he can't kick like he use . but he very sincere actor . i seen greater performances his earlier movies . i give him credit , he still kicking butt he darn good angle when he kicks . any true fan would not put actor down . give me break he only human . jean-claude van damme you great actor my book . although i would like see you play more love scene movie . kiss you vivica . fox great !!!! stay strong baby	1
i travel work , so i often rely fitness dvds help me stay shape . i've only working out seriously few months , this dvd definitely too easy me . there 2 cardio workouts , 5 toning work outs , warm up , cool down , all over toning workout . this seems great , but when you actually look details , you'll see cardio workouts only 13 minutes each , toning workouts only 5 minutes each . so when you actually look pre-set workouts ( without warm up cool down ) , you're only getting 20 minutes real exercise . i would say this good dvd if you've never exercised or you really out shape . but even if you've exercising little while , you'll probably find it too easy . i strongly recommend method cardio bootcamp , or 10 minute solutions carb burner , or 10 minute solutions pilates . all three these videos give you ability choose your workouts or combine smaller segments into longer workout . if you're looking good toning workout , try self bikini ready fast .	-1
i actually bought this dvd because virginia madsen just seen " sideways " . i won't re-hash plot amazon already provided potential buyers outline . however , while madsen all members cast great don johnson real revelation here . his acting nothing short superb complex part required him demonstrate wide emotional range slick cynicism tenderness , homicidal rage/grief abject confusion smart operator who thoroughly out played . looks plus smarts plus intention equal sex appeal . no wonder women fought over him .	1

" logan run " great nostalgic 1970s science fiction . 70s great era sci-fi , where future viewed optimism , awe wonder , unlike digital-age , cookie-cutter sci-fi we get today , offers nothing but gloom doom . i just little kid when " logan run " first released , but i remember blown away it premise -- futuristic society young people living inside futuristic domed-city , where you're not allowed live past age 30 . there really no where runners ( those who refuse end their lives 30 voluntarily ) go elude sandmen ( city police ) , outside domed-city post-apocalyptic , laid ruins earth outside-somewhere near old city washington . .. michael york plays logan 5 , one sandmen who turns out more heart than city would probably prefer . richard jordan ( francis 7 ) his fellow sandman/friend who fiercely loyal city status quo , begins doubts logan loyalty this status quo after he finds logan hanging around nursery . reason all this you'll find out when you watch movie . i actually wish they shown more domed-city than they . it really cool-looking structure , fascinating sci-fi concept . but you see exterior aerial visual-effects shots city movie opening , then few glimpses afterward , but after opening shots , movie quickly gets story surrounding characters , lot scenes take place sets scenes location . like redressed shopping malls , because indoor malls new 70 , people still fascinated these indoor shopping arenas , so it made sense redress one these new malls represent interior futuristic city . but miniatures built exterior aerial shots domed-city really cool look . some people , probably younger people who grew up this cgi age , ridicule film city looking fake like model . yeah , if you squint , you makes out few imperfections , but so what ? minatures look spectacular their time . but all dated aspects this film what makes it all more interesting . imperfection more interesting than perfection anyway . but " logan run " one last sci-fi epics . those stand-alone films like grand mgm stamp them . everything today so cookie-cutter bland , production companies you've never heard putting out direc t-t o-dvd caliber movies faster than bic corporation putting out pens . it just not same anymore . but definately purchase " logan run " dvd . it even better viewing it widescreen , it shown theaters	-1

i not seen this movie years , recently added it my netflix list . i forgot how much i enjoyed this movie first time i viewed it . based best-selling book , eagle landed very entertaining . cast strong action pretty non-stop . michael caine , robert duval , larry hagman all provide excellent performances . negative side , movie little long today standards , donald sutherland character somewhat over . but , it fun follow twists plot progresses , realize end no one really wins . fictional german plot kill churchill prevented , some crack german paratroopers all die . if you like movies such where eagles dare guns navarone , you probably enjoy eagle landed well	1
" lie me " sexually charged love story somehow got away mpaa rating . i think filmmakers must mpaa , because this movie got some graphic scenes . we're talking full frontal male female nudity , sex looks very unsimulated . you don't see full penetration , but ... well , you'll see it . this movie adapted book i hope book more depth than this , because i feel something must lost transition book-to-screen . movie leila ( lauren lee smith ) , girl lot people would call " slut . " leila likes sex she likes it lot . she doesn't seem understand love or relationship , but she understands sex . could this attributed bad homelife ? it could , but filmmakers don't really show her bad homelife . her parents getting divorced her sister get married , despite sex her ex just couple nights before marriage . it kind bad , but not this bad . anyway , leila ends up party where she hastily drags guy outside begins performing oral sex him . meanwhile , guy she met few minutes ago named david ( eric balfour , ' texas chainsaw massacre ' ) sitting truck watching her his girlfriend . girlfriend begins copying leila both leila david sex their respective partners ; they look each other something there . they may not sure what , but it there . next day , david goes looking leila he finds her . she begins masturbate playground him , which freaks him out bit , but he returns her they both sex i swear isn't simulated . there almost no way it could . anyway , some reason ; we find out david caring his invalid father . but this really important plot ? i mean it bit heartwrenching , but not very important . this movie could've poignant , but that where it misses . performances good enough movie entertaining ; it vast improvement over sexually charged movie called " 9 songs " ( which sex wasn't simulated slightly more graphic than this ) . balfour smith make cute couple ; sex scenes great . but , overall , it misses bit . grade : b-	-1

i cannot believe how many negative reviews this film actually received . they watching same movie i watching ? i generally concider myself very critical when it comes political thrillers such " sentinel " , so i am not going just generally give such movie one my favorite genres high rating automatically without giving it some fore-thought . " sentinel " everything intense , well-crafted political thriller should . acting quite convincing suspense riveting . i guarantee you pinned edge your seat through entire film then some . also , scenario extremely plausible , especially today world , all militant groups out there -- neo-nazis islamic radicals -- who would stop nothing make assination attempt or terrorist attack against president or some u.s. institution . my advice , before listening negative rants other reviewers this film , go ahead take look it yourself . it safe bet you not disappointed .	1
this overwrought tripe cinematic equivalent dead fish . it doesn't work good trash or high camp . edward dmytryk directs harold robbins ' source material lead foot . george peppard made larger artistic contribution when he " a-team " . alan ladd , who misfortune this his last film credit , essentially sleepwalks through this picture . it equally unfortunate talented actors like carroll baker , elizabeth ashley , martin balsam associated this swill . heck , i even feel bad former boxing champ archie moore his play thankless role houseboy . film lone redeeming quality costume designs edith head(the women lingeree particular ) . if you must waste 150 minutes your time it better spent watching paint dry or grass grow	-1

i've seen this movie time time since 1970 , but , image entertainment dvd , i feel like i'm seeing it first time -- it good ! picture my public domain dvd ( which i just threw out ) basically looked like few light areas ( faces , lamps , etc . ) surrounded large black areas no details - actually , i should say large dark gray areas no details . it often hard see where characters what they doing . picture image dvd much-closer-to-normal gray scale shows much finer detail . you see things shadows . gray scale still isn't quite up modern standards , but i'm sure that not image fault . you're watching 85-year-old movie . they used best print they could find , it vast improvement over anything else i've seen . there string quartet score which works very well movie . if you didn't know better , you'd think it original score . they recreated expressionist style original intertitles , even added some " digi-dirt " make them better match rest film . translation doesn't use obscure words like " mountebank " " fakir , " like my public domain copy . ( yes , course you look them up , but who wants run dictionary while they're watching movie ? )plus , it tinted match original . helps this movie lot , because its odd sets , it often hard tell if scene set indoors or out , or if it day or night . picky i am , i didn't find frame line too distracting ! it not many scenes . i'm glad they allowed us see whole picture , rather than cropping shots . i haven't seen kino version , so i can't compare two , but i recommend this version without reservations	1

i'm starting think number one requirement job " president " should " acting experience .

it ability see dead people ? yes , sense . but broader sense , it ability see invisible , non-sensory forces motivate people behaviors . movie , sense manifested child ability see " ghosts , " ability see undead people whose souls not rest , still troubled what they perceive mistakes their past . many children adults gifted ability " see " what other people cannot see , ability see what read lines 5 normal senses . 6th sense sensory skill improved through effort education . it often learned best watching socially intelligent women who suffered greatly decided try find ways understand care those hurting around them . 6th sense empathy . if tree falls woods , no one around , it still heard empathetic people . those us who understand grief losing someone , pains not diminish after they pass away prematurely . time passing not ease pain . intoxicants not kill pain . we never stop remembering their light , their humor , their hopes , our loss connection . like ghosts , best sense term , we see them regularly revisit us . this great film these , many more universal reasons	1

someone well versed various kinds literature , someone who read ( enjoyed ) almost all tom clancy novels , professional videographer , i say , this great flick . those who upset adaptation , what you expect ? when taking 800 plus page book condensing it down two hour movie , some things going change . second third clancy movies- especially clear present danger - also adapted give harrison ford action spotlight . but now ford ageing , paramount ( who after all , business needing turn profit ) needed re-invent franchise . move make it not just new actor , but show it start jack ryan career cleverly . most all , it held true idea book , when we base our actions off our fears suspicions , our peace torn apart few depraved individuals . this movie falls into category action/thriller . such , not everything true life , but instead designed entertainment suspense . it delivers . something action category it remarkably intelligent script . it little slow beginning those who looking nothing more than explosions shootouts , but it worth it . it also better than average cinematography compared most action flicks . effects well not all cheesy , many action flicks taught us expec t.t he acting well-done , typically good performance affleck stellar performance freeman . soundtrack also fantastic , especially rendition national anthem football game . bottom line , if you're reader who expects movies scripts written like books , don't see this movie . if you accept literature movies entirely different formats entertainment then you'll probably enjoy this movie , it certainly worth ownin	1
i'm avid reader , always , but i've felt kind burned out reading late , who wouldn't after reading hundreds hundreds books , one after , usually reading two books time , several books week ? also , my schedule no longer allows me freedom read much i used . why i decided watch this film when netflix sent it me despite fact i hadn't read nicholas sparks novel first . now i wish i'd read book . this one most beautiful tear-jerking stories i seen ! everyone who knows me knows i'm sucker stories pull heart strings . they also know stories centered star-crossed lovers my major weakness . most my all-time favorite books movies those characteristics common . i won't go into details plot because i don't want give away spoilers potential viewers ( though i'm sure many people already ) -- all i say you cannot go wrong this film if you're hopeless romantic . actors wonderful . ryan gosling rachel mcadams transmit all right emotions flawless job characterization . they add great deal depth range their characters i can't imagine better actors roles . gena rowlands also wonderful older allie . i like 1940s setting backdrop -- however brief -- second world war . wardrobe , settings , scenery cinematography flawless . dvd great investment . widescreen edition makes viewing all more pleasurable . i cannot recommend notebook enough . i don't know if i'll read book because i don't like reading novels after i watched their film adaptations , but i definitely read other nicholas sparks novels not-so-distant future	1

brilliant companion piece swimming pool , francois ozon under sand similarly casts charlotte rampling lead female , here tale loss . interestingly , both films , she position someone not only literate but directly involved literature . swimming pool , she writer ; here , she instructor literature . this key understanding how subtle ozon these two masterful films . parallel both works fusing fantasy reality . under sand , marie ( rampling ) husband disappears her fantasy life -- reinforced , it implied , her profession -- blossoms into imagining her husband still her , long after his disappearance , , well , feeling hands stroking all parts her body one amazing scene . more subtly , ozon here , swimming pool , uses mix french english -- both language culture -- emphasize blurring fantasy reality . when marie best friend -- like her , bilingual english woman married french man -- speaks her , it sometimes french , sometimes english , indicating fluidity thought feeling two modes existence . marie friend sympathizes her loss -- french -- but wants her face up reality what happened continue her life -- english . similarly , marie new lover tells her he thinks english morbid . but he french tells her this french ; it shows , ozon says , there desire french feel deeply , contrasted english who desire think deeply . such implication here . marie french , though born english , it just this fusing two cultures within herself results her confusion fantasy reality . however , it would too easy equate french fantasy english reality ; ozon not really this simplistically above seems indicate . instead , he imply this several scenes , but well shows us marie telling her friend , english , jean ( her lost husband ) taking nap or out walk when he not her year or so . , marie herself not able distinguish difference two cultures flowing her blood -- not able differentiate simply all difference fantasy reality , thought feeling . this brought head great ending sequence , not revealed here , which jean , perhaps , not lost after all . or he ? ozon superbly intelligent filmmaker who closely investigates what how we think feel , delicately exposing nuances behavior how they determine who we really . subtlety shown his work truly astonishing marks him one great french directors working today	1

this canadian film ( set british columbia ) tells story young working class woman who learns she fast-growing , untreatable cancer dead within months . oddly enough , she decides not tell anyone ( how she stand it ? ) instead makes list things she wants before she dies . much film involves affair she ( character played mark ruffalo ) -- she her first child 17 , her husband her first only , so she wants broaden her experience life before she dies . i think way she handles this news her impending death odd probably unfair people she loves ( she doesn't see it way ) , i think someone who real life would leave lot angry people behind , who never chance say things they wanted say . but this film , after all , it credible someone would this . she , after all , very young very young don't always make great choices . if you watch this film others , i think you'll find lots talk . don't watch it if you're already feeling depressed , because it sad movie many ways .	-1

when i walzted into blockbuster other day(but like any other day ) i head straight anime section . avid fan anime , i plunge headlong into any anime and/or manga , knowing relativley nothing it . so , my sister i stood pondering over which dvd grab(we there well over ten minutes ) we snatched whatever looked least hlfway decent , it just happened appleseed escaflowne . we portable dvd player car , , because i knew alittle bit appleseed , we watched first . holy crap(excuse my bluntness ) but i amazed thoroughly enjoyed mysef . really great movie , but that beside point . so when we finally return home , i good mood hadhigh hopes escaflowne would good too , although i never heard it . we popped dvd began watch . well , my sister very imature kept commenting hitomi nose . ahh ... she so annoying , but i didn't care particularly how character looked . it seemed intresting beginning , how hitomi persieved life , it made sense how she felt . then wierd stuff began . i guess because i haven't watched tv series , i didin't really understand gaia all . wasn't much history movie , so i didn't understand hw everything tied . anyway , i liked van his relationship his brother i like van . . . alot . but i found hitomi rather annoying , constatly damsel distress beckoning aid others complaining her mundane lifestyle ... well , i could go one one . dragon armor , escaflowne cool , i liked raw savagnss fight armours end . but there just something kept me really likeing it . there good premise movie , but it almost poorly executed . writing hitomi absolutly horendous . trust me , there numerous accounts which she repeated same thing over over , which i would understand if she contradicting herself , but it more reasuring herself out loud everything . consistantly annoying . it almost good , so i give it 4 out 5 . but my sister would give it much , much less	-1

disney really gave this film ar t-t reasure treatment . film nearly 50 years old , but colors glow sound wonderful . painstaking frame-by-frame restoration conducted , soundtrack remastered , resulting film which probably looks better now dvd than when it originally released . this film always favorite mine all disney classics , i think music lot it . " once upon dream " truly beautiful , which given considering classical composition it based . artwork superb , even disney its heyday . this movie rightly considered classic , finally given its due dvd	1
this dvd great it lots exercises tailored todifferent body areas . i found it cumbersome work through because each set exercises different segment choose dvd , so you must stop periodically click anew segment . however , fairness i say they providean option creating your own program , which probablythe best way it . denise her usual excellent job giving precise , simple-to-follow directions , provides lots varietyhere too . beginner could probably negotiate through this buti would rate it better advanced beginner orintermediate .	-1
i'm glad dvds finally coming out this series . i'm biased -- i writer executive producer show several years i've written seven original diagnosis murder novels . my only complaint this dvd boxed set -- beyond lack commentaries , deleted scenes , other material -- they didn't include tv movies produced aired broadcast pilot ( jake fatman episode ) premiere first season episodes . hopefully they include those movies bonus materials subsequent dvd sets	1
real women curves story ana ( played america ferrera ) , latina teenager , during summer her 18th year . ana beautiful . hourglass figure melon breasts , full lips long thick hair . she intelligent strong willed but held back her family , especially her mother who constantly berates her because her physical appearance . ana lives her family east los angeles mexican community but she goes high school beverly hills ; feat she accomplished her own . story begins ana getting ready her last day high school . her mother feigns sick get her stay home but ana doesn't fall it heads off school showing immediately strained relationship these two women emphasis ana places education . ana mother , carmen ( played lupe ontiveros ) old school ; she started working her family when she thirteen . she married young became mother . work family her life . she wants same ana wants ana want same which odd scenario because most story mom want more their children . carmen constantly insults ana her weight front everyone . story moves it becomes more disturbing . estela ( played ingrid oliu ) ana adult sister . she still lives home runs sewing factory where they all work , estela fashion design . they make dresses bloomingdales , getting $18 dress when store sells them $600 . this infuriates ana well fact they never make dresses bigger than size 7 . estela many heavy weights beside physical weight she carries . she fighting keep factory open , pay rent , get dresses made time satisfy buyers keep her employees working despite inability pay them their wages . three employees move back mexico estela ana promise stay help recent order . ana unknowing help , estela steps outside box begins designing her own dresses . special gift , she makes special red gown ana , regrettably we never get see ana it . like ana but lesser degree , carmen berates estella . it during one these time carmen mentions love , " it because i love you i make your life so miserable . " estela replies , love me less . george lopez makes appearance ana teacher , mr. guzman . he encourages her go college , helps her fill out her college application makes special visit plead ana parents let her go college when she offered full scholarship columbia . although small role , lopez character effective nurturing teacher looking help woman his own community . best scene movie when women factory , strip their underwear expose their secrets . it all starts when ana can't take heat factory any longer removes her shirt cool herself . her mother freaks , telling her she too fat show much her body . ana not ashamed or afraid her body she lets her mother know it . other women factory back her up . they begin share their body parts how they feel it . they take off their clothes which further infuriates carmen . " this who we " yells ana , " real women . " they all celebrate each other ( without carmen ) go back work their underwear after carmen walks out . this seen easily shows how ana estela evolve while carmen seems trapped her bitterness insecurities . she opportunity bond her daughters , women , chooses not . it very exhilarating watch . real women curves worth seeing this scene alone . throughout movie laced lots peppy mexican music shots mexican community . there subtitles family members but it isn't distracting enough cumbersome adds angst family . i love this little film strong willed girl transition teenager into woman . america ferrera plays part ana confident teenager who devilish side egging her mother . she still insecurities discover conquer . it easy love her , her sister even her mother . i would liked estela storyline expanded hers interesting character . most importantly this film success success characters not contingent ana losing weight finding true love happy . real women curves movie not only latina women but , i think , girls women everywhere battling views others how they should feel their bodies . original review posted http://largeandlovely.bellaonline.co	-1
better title this cheap-budget film " staying lame , " since it nothing more than shell plot featuring two well-known actors . when i say actors , i may stretching it bit , since samuel . gives wooden performance every time , while ben " good hunting " affleck performed best lo arm candy . but movie pitiful back-and-forth revenge saga , unbelievable , reminiscent ping-pong match . it " firm " wannabe , bruce willis entendre copy not worth $4 it cost rent your local video rental store . hopefully , one day , both main actors go acting school , or better yet , stop making movies altogether . but then , there always remake " gone fishin '" starring danny glover joe pesci would perfect sammy benny . , or both could act together inside jaba hutt costume final prequel star wars . just don't expect me rent it when it comes out .	-1

" memento " eclipses everything which preceded it , set bar so high it may never topped . all $5 million production costs . director nolan remarkable job juggling complex plot elements , but sabotages himself some his rather ordinary visual schemes . i refer you diner sequence which characters portrayed guy pearce joe pantoliano converse over soup . given film shot panavision 2.35 : 1 anamorphic process , scene would played more effectively if nolan simply planted his camera medium shot two skillful actors they provided plot exposition . instead , nolan intercuts close ups two , which method more typical appropriate narrower aspect ratio television . close ups work best when used judiciously provide emphasis . i mention this only because this how detailed i go order find fault film . if i didn't know better i would swear pearce american actor -- his accent authentic . all performances convincing it always fun see " eve 6 " ( harriet sansom harris ) great " x-files " episode . this film proof morally bankrupt notion movies cost $200 miilion or more . i am sick ugly , witless , loud blockbusters which polluting pop culture . if choice spend sort money making movie ... or allow movie go unmade ...

i purchased this season trepidation i dubious changes casting i loved previous 8 seasons richard dean anderson rest . humour excellent each episode most enjoyable leaving me always wanting more . well , imagine my surprise when i watched first few episodes find changes not detracted show all but made it every bit good before . writers etc not tried replace o'niell character but introduced new dynamic some excellent humour . episodes very good while i still 4 episodes watch , i am hoping rumours show cancelled after season 10 not true . i watch this show long it available . ( i watch dvd i not get show tv here ) . i love new humour all cast transition gou'ald ori interestingly handled . it also great see team not always succeed , but i hope they eventually overcome ori . extras , i enjoyed those i watched , but i generally not buy dvds extras rather show/movie . extras bonus . i would heartily recommend this season any stargate fans out there who dubious due cast change . those who yet watch eny episode , rather watch first 8 seasons first , then this one there references past incidents flash backs not likely make sense if you haven't seen them . roll next season !!!!	1
there really so much say this movie , condensing it all into short review impossible . put it simply possible , brokeback mountain work art slowly almost subliminally works its way into your psyche , refusing hint or portray its message until very end , which point your emotions virtually devastate you . storyline pretty well-known now . jack ennis , two 19-year-old ranch hands , hired early 1960 tend flock sheep atop grazing grounds brokeback mountain montana . jack , son overly strict distant father , quick make friends laugh , while ennis , orphan raised his brother sister , shy , withdrawn , almost gun-shy society . during course summer , jack gradually draws ennis out his shell two unexpectedly start sexual relationship . end summer , each goes their own way start traditional families , but cannot deny feelings they each other . they then maintain 20-year romance through camping fishing trips several times year . execution this movie near flawless ! cinematography so beautiful points , it almost too much eyes comprehend . musical score understated feels perfectly home within film . direction near perfect . film never loses focus two actors ... opening scene end , this movie them . supporting characters never dismissed , though attention not focused them , they nonetheless memorable without ever stealing scenes actors . only drawback film makeup . 2nd part film takes place over span 20 years , shows actors gradually aging 19 39 . makeup isn't quite up job make these young actors appear middle-aged weathered . all honesty though , i'm not sure any makeup anywhere fully pull off . actors , jake gyllenhall heath ledger played their roles beautifully . it quickly becomes apparent actors chose these parts not money , nor any fame ( it never meant released major film ) , but rather because they believed story wanted portray their characters best they could . jake gives life jack refreshingly wonderful manner , heath disappears , leaving behind withdrawn , shell-shocked ennis . movie progresses very slow pace . it never boring , but throughout one wonders where film going what it trying say . sentiment continues grow almost threatens lose you audience member until last 20 minutes or so . point , plot takes sudden surprisingly-devastating turn . it surprisingly devastating because you simply don't expect made such emotional connection characters , but found you . film reaches it emotional impact , it becomes achingly apparent it woven itself under your skin now part you ... it its claws you not letting go . it climaxes , you're left rush emotion surprises you few films ever able garner . it point where you realize purpose everything previously film . entire film leadup one simple message , one simple premise . it gut-wrenching realization end lingers your mind long after you've walked away screen . movie honest . it documents portrays . it makes no statement or against homosexuality . it unapologetic , yet compassionate . it all-time classic	1

spun absolute pleasure watch . it doesn't wait around get noticed , instead it sets it own pace , like example - no credits roll beginning , no apologetic character introductions , there no stop sign this film , everything unhooked raw , yet nothing seems out place . direction bizzare , camerawork staggering places , sets like gutters , music extraordinarily amusing acting level . there many characters film quite wide variety too . reason i compare spun run lola run because it nearly entertaining german wonderflick . spun possibly one kind . i enjoyed it more than i enjoyed trainspotting . now , saying lot . unfortunately , i haven't seen many movies like spun hollywood . so i no recommendations . this absolute must watch , if there ever one	1

what you say columbo , unassuming bungling , yet brilliant sleuth who always gets his man or woman . part brilliance this series murder occurs beginning episode . columbo then called scene crime his annoying ultimately endearing manner slowly unravels mystery . it becomes obvious early columbo uncanny instincts , intelligence experience handle job almost always suspect mind . murders ingenious sometimes umpremeditated , yet murderers all ultimately incrimminate themselves their own behavior many clues they drop way . when columbo finally nabs his mouse after long determined pursuit , he then reveals them their one fatal mistake which led their undoing . while there no class distinction crime , it certainly more interesting watching accomplished often brilliant individuals extraordinary settings than common street thugs drug dealers . you learn wealthy their problems just like everyone else often victimized themselves . impressive settings , creative plots excellent performances , all directed renowned film makers sure stimulate your mind senses columbo destined remain delight small screen . season four just engaging first three seasons i personally difficult time deciding which i like best . columbo series hits its stride early remains consistently good several seasons come . you can't miss here quality never falters columbo never fails deliver . only exception me episode mrs. columbo which i never liked . other than , you're safe selecting this great addition your collection or first many seasons you inevitably want .	1

this past august , i bought soundtrack pete townsend 1989 musical iron man , which also based ted hughes 1968 novel , impressed not only mr. townsend artistry , but also wisdom message its songs conveyed individual selections entire album just plain fun listen . naturally , i thus came thinking maybe this motion picture , which released whole decade after particular cd , would likely appeal my imagination same way musical would , i only opportunity see latter presentation myself . unfortunately , i found out how wrong i when i rented this rightfully less-than-appreciated flick last weekend forced myself sit through it . now , i'll admit , animation definitely something worthy applause ; that one thing i'll give iron giant credit . however , that far my praise this movie goes . i'll also admit it didn't follow exact same lines either book or musical , but then again , i expecting case . rather , it overall tone film earned my enmity . begin , though i am well aware many animated features other family-themed features contain occasional sight gag or adul t-t hemed joke , tig seemed heavily punctuated them , beatnik scrap-sculptor dean mcchoppin unzipping his fly let young hogarth hughes " pet " squirrel escape his pants " bathroom " scene where hogarth tries cover robot hand it exits hughes home -- latter scene which least two instances what one could easily call " toilet-bowl humor . " not only , but i found protagonist himself just most obnoxious repulsive example lead character i ever come know : loud , unruly , disobedient brat reminiscent all four young charlie bucket tourmates willie wonka chocolate factory who tries pass himself off more depth than he really . honestly , he not what i would call " amiable , " " heart-warming , " or even " cute " ; such adjectives i'd rather reserve wide-eyed , honest , poverty-stricken mr. bucket . course , it not like i really appreciated any other human characters this flick , either -- not little mr. hughes ridiculously clueless diner waitress mother annie , nor deadbeat wannabe " artist " dean , nor even inept government agent whose name i completely ( yet thankfully ) forgotten despite his most complex earthling participant entire cartoon . such , only hundred-foo t-t all , metal-munching robot -- softhearted self-maintaining ( if nonetheless hopelessly brain-damaged ) extraterrestrial who no memory all his origin -- impressed me . even so , movie portrayed poor guy so incredibly dimwitted ( opposed haplessly misguided tad naive , which i hoping he'd come off ) effort make him likeable kids audience i ended up pitying him more than anything else . needless say , then , much i tried grapple each every one these elements they presented themselves , i merely found it harder harder get over accept them all collective whole , i ended up returning this movie video store utter disgust . believe me , ladies gentlemen , i really tried appreciate iron giant , but despite my efforts trying see side story its fans see it , all naught , now i am left asking myself just why i even bothered rent it first place . after all , it known one number very unpopular motion pictures 1999 , good reason : it caters very low level mentality , even amongst underdeveloped minds kids whom it made . tragically , so many other movies these days , regardless how successful or unsuccessful they -- current , seven-plus-year-long fad honestly disturbs me gets me wondering sensibility average person these days . worse yet how movie plagued such lowbrow buffoonery this one would " special edition " dvd five years after its initial release -- especially considering how allegedly few people actually seen it . oh , well ... i still wish i could've seen pete townsend iron man musical . least would something worth witnessing	-1

" adventures spin marty " title refers first season ( 1955-56 ) show ; second third seasons given modified title . when originally broadcast total running time 275 minutes broken into 25 episodes shown part first year " mickey mouse club " . show broadcast monday-friday 5pm-6pm . serials structured mild cliffhanger format teaser end enticing viewers watch next episode resolution . when they shown few years ago " vault disney " episodes paired up provide 22-23 minute running time . if you grew up original mmc you already know serials like this most anticipated part show " spin marty " far most popular . reason their popularity no mystery , they only kid shows those days featured kids instead puppets or animation . if you not around " spin marty " phenomenon , think it 1950 version " saddle club " , both featured kids getting spend all their time horses . but instead girls hanging out pine hollow stables , here it boys living bunk houses " triple " , dude ranch summer camp . who wouldn't like spending entire summer ranch , riding horses far away parental supervision ? first season story adapted novel " marty markham " lawrence watkin . show went rapidly downhill after first season so it no great tragedy only season one out dvd . mostly this because writers never able duplicate charm first season premise . but show also fell victim kevin corcoran curse . corcoran terminally precocious little actor disney tried make star inserting him into this popular show start second season . corcoran unbearably bad actor damage compounded disney insistence manipulative showcasing his terminal cuteness ; especially bad fit show whose first season appeal its naturalness understated performances cast . like " saddle club " first season , it revolves around new kid who difficulty fitting ranch . marty markham ( david stollery ) overprotected orphaned rich kid who arrives his grandmother chauffeured limousine his own butler ( perkins-j . pat o'malley-who detailed help ranch cook ) immediately manages offend all boys calling triple-r ranch " smelly old farm " . rivalry soon develops spin evans ( tim considine ) , popular boy who work all year pay attendance costs . marty afraid horses but lies polo player . considine stollery both convincing although stollery more difficult part . supporting cast boys appropriate nicknames ; lazy " ambitious " , freckled " speckle " chunky " russell muscle " . special effects bit weak ( like woodchuck chase scene where you accept ball fur pulled though field string woodchuck ) campfire scenes obvious day night shooting . harry carey jr. roy barcroft provide sympathetic concerned authority figures but my favorite insightful horse trainer ollie ( leonard geer ) who always seemed nine days worth stubble repeatedly said : " well i'll blue-nosed gopher " . predictably marty learns love horses get other boys . he breaks his arm but perkins able keep news his grandmother so he not sent home early . there all great summer camp elements bears ghost stories . two-disc dvd set photo gallery , interviews , little feature called " return triple-r " ; which includes adult considine stollery visiting ranch where most show filmed . then again , what i know ? i'm only child	1

new world least terrence malick limited filmography date , could best described monotone poem . it not exactly bad , just mundane rather forgettable even while you're watching it , more self-indulgence than genuine attempt communicate audience . visually it often seems surprisingly flat uninspired , while script comprises far too many trite voice over questions s-p-o-k-e-n v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y i-n h-u-s-h-e-d t-o-n-e-s against selections his classical music collection , which doesn't magically render them profound but simply makes film evenly paced point where nothing stand out : even battle sequence takes time out more musings . big problem miscasting inexplicably prolific colin farrell , nice enough lad offscreen i'm sure but extraordinarily limited actor who just cannot carry picture no matter how many chances he given . true form he trots out his two `important picture ' expressions - bambi-caught-in-the-headlights-of-an-oncoming-car one one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he not getting enough roughage his diet . fact he outshone q'orianka kilcher her first speaking part speaks volumes his inadequacy , although fair he worse . indeed , among male leads christian bale much , much more much , much less last third film , typically underused christopher plummer first third . malick very good madness mutiny infects deluded settlers jamestown , but because it happens people we've barely introduced it carries no emotional or dramatic weight . if anything , it just made me think how much more herzog could made it all . moments work , most notably expulsion `naturals ' their land brief latter sequences england , but evidence 135-minute version i very much doubt malick promised longer cut solve problems . i know it meant work art , but i just came away feeling i'd watched old very average universal international 50s western redubbed first-year philosophy students . only surprise jeff chandler his bouncing basques didn't crop up .	-1

** spoiler alert ! ** time most people got theater see this film , or rented it , they already knew ship its crew would dead less than two hours . surprisingly , this not diminish film power . even second or third viewing , film never delivers moment false , maudlin , or sentimental . plot not what keeps people engaged during this film . it issue . how people face death ? this film , people captain crew boat . they know commercial fishing difficult dangerous job , even when weather good . weather not good . men need money . they go out even though they know they meet storm . they used risking their lives every day . storm turns into hurricane traps men , kills them . they struggle save their own lives . they fail . when they neck deep water compartment overturned boat , they face death squarely . they talk , briefly , unsentimentally , things they not able , people they miss . stark , plainness acting achieves powerful effect . beginning film , viewer meets crew . repeated viewings , film shows nothing milked -- nothing artificial . men solid , working people . there no sappy foreshadowing . director deserves kudos maintaining iron-fisted control vehicle could campy . viewer learn lot meteorology . special effects indistinguishable live action . all actors , including george clooney , maintain stoic engagement life , they struggle live , no appeal our pity , until they dead . perfect storm more than film . it parable . one could invest such classic work art	1
i've this workout many times i've come really enjoy it . it broken into 3 sections : 1 ) warmup , upper body , stretch 2 ) warmup , lower body , stretch 3 ) warmup , abs , stretch . some people upper body , lower body , abs three separate days , so individual warmup benefit them . but i like total body one day , so i found individual warmup each section unnecessary . i only first warmup . i'll either fast forward other two warmups or take time res t.t his workout definitely not firm tradition compound exercises , i.e. squats into shoulder presses or lunges into bicep curls . each exercise isolated , which my kind strength training style . upper body section goes quickly . pushups , lat rows , bent over rows , shoulder presses , side front lateral raises , french presses , tricep kickbacks , bicep curls end it . most unique exercise bicep curls sitting fanny lifter . you bring dumbbell up halfway , not all way up like traditional bicep curl . different refreshing . lower body tough - all those squats , lunges , step-ups fanny lifter . squats step-ups seemed endless because my thighs so tired , but least means workout effective . abs pretty good . crunches , obliques , bicycles , planks . what i really like how stephanie tells you either use light , medium , or heavy weights each exercise . " squat get heavy weights . " that great idea . i like guided way . stephanie instructor soft-spoken quiet . she not dynamic instructor , but doesn't mean she dull . she still cues well says reasurring things like " that tough , " which i find myself nodding agreement . everyone wears purple tops black bottoms . when i first this workout , i disappointed boring music . it wasn't exciting rocking like i expect modern video . it sounded more like background music . but it grown me , some exercises actually match music , especially during abs section . set all white . floor light colored hardwood or laminate flooring . it modern but unfortunately lacks character . not big deal though . long workout good , that all matters . overall , i really like this video . i like gym style doing one exercise time doing total body one video tape	1

akira kurosawa made rashomon 1950 , ikiru 1952 seven samurai 1954 . all these films quite complex structure . yet ikiru remains very simple film , which says nothing original : it not what shown , but how , important , flaubert story " simple heart " . it appreciated best those who've realised they're going die ( you'll know what i mean ) . watching ozu tokyo story beforehand prepare you subtle style . ikiru five themes interwoven : 1 . learning accept deathat start film kanji watanabe ( takashi shimura ) learns he stomach cancer six months live . he retreated into his work after his wife early death become devoted routine . camera shows us several shots closeup shimura face after he speaks his doctor , we see anguish his eyes . it not fear he shows : it horror , horror what his life become . shock his wife death caused him stop living . shock his own coming death makes him realise he must start live : only then he ready die . there contrast documentary style depiction hospital scenes watanabe office compared closeups shimura , hunched up horrified realisation or showing eyes black pools despair . this hardest thing any art form : this simplicity , effect overwhelming , acting superb . 2 . placing value your lifewatanabe not much expertise how live . his son mitsuo ( nobuo kaneko ) daughter-in-law kazue ( kyoko seki ) share his home but not much else . watanabe cannot speak them his cancer . cast out his own resources , watanabe tells complete stranger ( yunosuke ito ) what he could not tell his son . he asks his burning question , how i live ? two drunken men go sample what they imagine life : drinking shops , reviews , dance halls , strip clubs . this desperate living , way dying . watanabe brings whole thing halt when he requests pianist play old song , sings words , young girls who fall love how they should enjoy love life short . perhaps it favourite he his wife when they first met . melody haunting , watanabe theme several key points film . later watanabe sees toyo ( miki odagiri ) one his office colleagues . watanabe exhilarated her joyous love life , her enthusiasm , even her appetite . perhaps she teach him how live . she teaches him he cannot live proxy . watanabe finally discovers fulfillment doing good others using his position work . kurosawa opens out sets progressively . we see small rooms watanabe house , then cafe dance hall scenes night , then streets shops day , then finally offices , streets slums watanabe moves company government heads departments , yakuza trying extort money them , fellow bureaucrats , workmen slum dwellers his quest children park built . giving meaning your life within everyone scope , no matter how narrow scope may , enlarges it . there touch moralist here , but we liable forget it we watch shimura , small , fragile , bowed over pain , absolutely determined make others respond . they . 3 . dangers griefhow watanabe become man he ? his bedroom photo young , attractive woman , his wife . flashback sequence we see her funeral , learn she died unexpectedly when her son only five or six years old . beautiful vanished . this theme haunting overtones japanese culture . power , greatness , beauty transient teach us how live more deeply . but watanabe given dead woman his love now he cannot stop grieving . watanabe bedroom photo next his citation exemplary attendance work . funeral car watanabe watches hearse draws further away him : it distance he tried deny ever since . 4 . entropy inherent large structureswatanabe started his bureaucratic life ambitions reform . his idealistic report mouldering away bottom drawer . but he working place where only activity filling out reports , not achieving change . it kind tomb . here no one accept responsibility ; anything unusual , such request group neighborhood mothers swamp filled made into playground , frantically passed department . this not merely satire . government , country local region , behaving watanabe , withdrawing living substituting empty formalism its place . it no accident watanabe head department . if we want we ask , it my problem too ? moralist much more evidence here . 5 . political response we others ' actionsthat watanabe not entire subject film made clear his death occurs halfway through it . we see buddhist wake . guests wake first give lip service watanabe virtues , then politicians among them compete credit building park . workers watanabe department discuss who next head . group petitioners admitted pay their respects . they say nothing ; but they grateful . japan it matters how dead thought . kurosawa shows all survivors , even grief stricken , motivated personal considerations . he shows this natural inevitable , while satirising more extreme manifestations it . mourners cannot give meaning their life praising watanabe though ; they need strive hard watanabe : most them won't . there social dimension our actions , our inactions . kurosawa wants viewers his film wake too , reflect what watanabe life death meant . watanabe dies his playground . he sits swing , sings his song young girls who fall love . it snowing . watanabe happy , not because playground , not because song . he found something vital . what makes ikiru important film viewers who watch it understand just what he found	1

if you're fan vampires , werewolves , action , or gothic suspense , this probably movie you'd interested checking out . while it not groundbreaking film , it highly entertaining one , one , me , something i rewatch several times per year . filming very attractive . everything dark , yet not so dark you can't see what going . movie gothic look it - sets , costumes , lighting . ( please don't mistake meaning gothic terms entertainment same thing gothic lifestyle . ) music , mostly heavy rock , fits well movie . action sequences expertly shot exciting watch . movie uses several techniques made popular " matrix " , but who cares ? it works perfectly within this movie . only downfall movie complete lack humor ... there not single joke entire thing ! everything so serious dark unless you're pretty good mood movie could really bring you down ... that how heavy it . set . added scenes provide more insight , special features treat , especially 45-minute documentary " fang vs . fiction " , which talks vampires werewolves . it very intriguing . if you're fan this movie you own dvd already , i would recommend selling it buying this version , it worth money	1

clint eastwood 1985 western " pale rider " obvious combination two earlier westerns : " shane " 1953 eastwood own " high plains drifter " 1973 . " pale rider " , no doubt , homage these films rather than rip-off . story : mysterious drifter clerical collar rides into town angel mercy local miner settlers angel punishment their rich oppressor his men . difference " pale rider " " shane " " pale rider " much more modern take same basic story ; plus , unlike " shane , " " rider " possesses supernatural element . although " shane " definitely better film historical sense , " rider " more entertaining experience modern viewers . hence , " pale rider " better film . comparisons " high plains drifter , " " pale rider " much better picture . " drifter " slow , tedious vibe all characters unlikable ( but two ) . eastwood plays mean anti-hero who enacts revenge entire town three villains ; he only displays kindness two people . " drifter " he solely agent vengeance . this not case " pale rider . " eastwood character " rider , " known only ' preacher , ' equal parts mysterious , intriguing , heroic supernatural . other words , viewer both likes roots ' preacher . ' noted above , " pale rider " features one most memorable lines cinematic history . megan , almost-15-year-old girl , informs preacher she thinks she loves him . preacher coolly responds : " nothing wrong . if there more love world there'd lot less dying .

i thought george stevens ' impeccably crafted literate greatest story ever told ( 1965 ) finest life jesus christ film . then i took look recently director nicholas ray king kings ( 1961 ) changed my mind . i don't know what best life jesus , but king kings charismatic sympathetic christ ( jeffrey hunter performance his career ) , great john baptist ( robert ryan ) , definitive salome dance ( luscious brigid bazlen ) ultimate sermon mount ( 7,000 extras spanish hillside ) , striking last supper disciples sitting y-shaped bench , strong crucifixion , reverent resurrection . 171 minutes ( including ten minutes miklos rozsa music ) , samuel bronston production seems ideal length tell story christ . screenplay oscar winner philip yordan . i often trouble ron randell roman lucius ; he major character here only cameo other biblical epics . same harry guardino barabbas . they , actuality , second third most important characters ray film . but both actors magnificent . lucius lets us inside roman power circle understand roman way thinking , so it nice his role big . barabbas answers question lot viewers may ponder , namely who this convicted killer whom crowd chose live while jesus died . movie , narrated orson welles , starts story pompey judea 63 b.c. this helps give us information what judea like several decades before jesus born . among superb supporting cast siobhan mckenna mary , royal dano peter , hurd hatfield pontius pilate , viveca lindfors herod antipas ' mistress , frank thring herod antipas , many more . sets costumes gloriously colorful ; what academy thinking when they not nominated oscars 1961 , no cast mermbers or screenplay ? rozsa music glorious . movie presented dvd 2.2 ratio 70mm super technirama . king kings powerful , intelligent , colorful , reverent . i think jesus himself would impressed it .	1

" i spit your grave " vile , sick , disgusting experience makes you feel unclean watching it . when it released 1978 , critics bashed it roger ebert calling it " vile piece garbage " gene siskel saying it one " most offensive movies i've seen my 11 years movie beat . " yet , it become certified cult classic isn't bad people build it up . true , it sick film through-and-through ... it seems like movie that trying depict how strong women , even though we watch women tortured raped not once , not twice , not three , but four f**king times . camille keaton ( grand-something buster ) plays jenny hill , writer who rents remote cabin country write novel . once there , four men take liking her ( one them retarded ) eventually they all rape her . this not one continuous scene four men each committing act , it four separate scenes . there first scene , then she crawls away , then it happens again , then she makes it her house , then it happens again . so so forth . movie only 100 minutes she doesn't begin her revenge trip until movie more than halfway through . usually " worst movies " ones where you tell someone entire plot it won't matter . true , if you're watching this film you know it woman who raped kills her four rapists . that truly all movie . when she commits last murder , movie ends . we , humans , fascinated macabre , disgusting , horrific . that why people watch movies like salo , pink flamingos , eraserhead , i spit your grave . yes , all these movies belong same category . although , theatrically , some those films listed better than others . say only sick people watch movies like this inaccurate watch films like this not wrong . yes , violence here exploited message it trying get across gets lost all blood , violence , castration occurs onscreen . " i spit your grave " not , definition , good film . it not film i want watch again , but horror film ( it horror film ) it pretty good . lots blood , lots violence , acting isn't half-bad , there lot skin ... you can't help but ( silently ) cheer keaton character when she gets her revenge men .

lady shanghi reputation secure classic film noir but then this genre notoriously disrespected probably because many film noirs based dime novels sound like it ; order appreciate film noir , therefore , you able enjoy kitschy quality snappy dime-novel dialogue . but kitsch alone not what makes ( some ) film noirs great . what really sets film noir apart other genres its striking , even elegant , visual style which often contrasts sharply its stark subject matter . film noir way glamourzing corruption , giving corruption unique aesthetic allure all its own . film noir probably owes something german expressionist film masters ( murnau , lang , von stroheim ) hollywood grotesques 20 30 but it absorbs evolves these influences into highly refined style its own . orson welles undisputed master high noir style . all his films after magnificent ambersons mobilize film noir methods techniques so welles ' reputation rises falls genre he not create but he perfected . film noir came age during wwii like many film noirs lady shanghai anxieties over race , class , sexuality , identity , this particular noir film , negotiating racial , social , cultural sexual difference increasingly globalized world . film takes place several international ( acapulco ) exotic ( chinatown ) settings these strange locales allow welles examine how his characters respond diverse array atmospheres social/cultural settings . welles himself plays central character film , michael o'hara , so he affects irish accent ( international touch ) , some critics argue , supposed sound false/inauthentic . o'hara way talking sounds bit too self-consciously literary ; though he affects working class worldliness his yarns sound like they come straight out conrad ( o'hara echoes many conrad colonial concerns ) hemingway ( o'hara echoes hemingway anti-franco sentiments ) so we suspect this character spent more time reading writing stories than actually working . whether we believe michael irish brogue authentic or not we know he fond creating fictions this casts suspicions his identity well his version events we hear voiceover . furthermore , we see his obsession literature given him taste romantic typically masculine posturing his favorite literary heroes instead making him worldly wise this just makes him all more gullible when pretty lady promise new adventure come . elsa ( played welles ' then-wife rita hayworth)identifies michael easy mark first time they meet . unlike michael elsa actually worldly we tell she seen experienced lot she knows lot world ( not just read lot it ) she sees through michael pseudo-brogue bravura right away knows exactly how exploit his romantic tendencies . she sums him up plays him first moment they exchange knowing glances ( hers much more knowing than his ) . michael prides himself his independence his integrity but he just can't help falling elsa pretend innocence helplessness -- its just too good resist -- he can't help wanting come charging her rescue even though there signs everywhere indicate elsa no need rescuing . first michael resists her job offer but she woman who always gets her way soon michael one her employee/servants just like all other men film . michael just can't tear himself away elsa dangerously seductive corruptive charms he willingly perhaps willfully misinterprets innocence helplessness only because version her makes him feel better his own true motives . michael hired extra hand elsa husband yacht soon he steps foot deck everyone else aboard sizes him up begins figuring how they use him further their own plots . elsa husband bannister famous lawyer both he his partner grisby , like michael , under elsa spell trying plot their way out captivity . yacht pulls out harbor we see word " circe " written bold letters yacht hull . elsa past secret only hinted ( all we know she born island somewhere east spent some time shanghai ) . she looks like penultimate american blonde but she not america her cultural reference points decidely eastern contrast michael western points reference ; michael she represents unknown perhaps unkowable , this part her allure also what makes her so dangerous . " elsa " prototypical femme fatale conventions film noir genre tell us things not end well anyone gets too close but she just too enticing . most famous scene film elsa sleek black bathing suit diving off some perilous rocks if she accustomed such danger if danger her natural element . but then she lays down sunbathe rocks relative safety boat michael looking , anxiously aware how dangerous she , allow himself comforting illusion she vulnerable she needs saving only he save her not only all other male predators board , but save her her own eastern imbued fatalistism . elsa so beautiful she all men film believing exactly what she wants them believe all them believing they've actually got chance her . men all slowly lose their head around her . some men talk down her but still they what she says she all them plotting against each other while lighting her cigarettes . film criticized impossibly tangled plot but i think point film you never supposed certain or not whether elsa merely defending herself against men who want control her or if elsa control all them ( just like she control michael ) start . even end we still want believe elsa victim something , perhaps something her past she just can't escape , but since we don't know what her past we no ultimate insight into what driving her all nor matter we any insight into what originary crime or sin driving men all ; all we know sexes races classes odds . elsa remains unknown all way through michael once ensnared must realize he too unknown because under her influence he forced act against what he perceived his own true nature . lady shanghai offers some most stunning visuals any film noir i know . acapulco scenes especially exciting danger unpredictability foreign woman made especially inviting exciting foreign land . this film welles offers ultimate noir vision anxiously uncertain men women attracted each other but also repelled what they find themselves attracted what they find themselves doing name desire . its film noir means film follows certain recognizable conventions but it more than simply follow those conventions , it pushes those conventions far they pushed explores nature those conventions more thorough way than any noir before or , arguably , since . end film characters become lost their own plots no longer know who they this conveyed brilliantly welles use masks mirrors celebrated luridly twisted funhouse scene which feels bit like famous dali sequence hitchcock spellbound but even more disorienting disconcerting ( spellbound released 1945 so it possible , even likely , welles seen it it influenced his own film made 1946 released 1948 ) . [ extra featurette follows film we learn welles himself painted much funhouse props set . ] there lot bad noirs out there these give genre bad name but few good ones among best films ever made . welles ' reputation would greater if film noir better understood appreciated not genre cheap dime novels inspired it but genre where cinema explores its own methods techniques . great directors lang von stroheim welles hitchcock godard chabrol other new wave auteurs all attracted noir this reason . brilliant film . after this film ( which commerical flop ) welles didn't work america ten years when he return america he made touch evil ( brilliant noir film ) . touch evil also failed generate revenue effectively ended welles career mainstream director even though he continued make independently financed small pictures like othello , macbeth , trial chimes midnight .	1

this one my all-time favorites movie made me fall adoration myrna loy . thin man first " oldie " flick i saw 10 year old , although sophisticated innuendos went over my head then , it still ingrained me love preference old movies hollywood golden age . much talk already said detailing stars ' chemistry plot itself . but i still wanted show my support this classic so i thought i'd contribute some hopefully interesting facts trivia re thin man . this second pairing william powell myrna loy , first manhattan melodrama ( 1934 ) . but t'was thin man cemented their star status hollywood . wonderful rapport two selling point movie ( sorry , dashiell hammett ) , rendering mystery plot secondary importance ( something missing , possibly murdered inventor ) . myrna loy 80 films , silent sound , mostly playing " other women " exotic vamps , before thin man came her way . mgm reluctant co-star myrna loy thin man , feeling myrna wasn't right role . also , time constraints played part studio plans star her stamboul quest , which begins filming 3 weeks . director woody " one-take " van dyke threatened walk out mgm relented but one condition : thin man completed under 3 weeks . van dyke finished 16 days . myrna played her last exotic role stamboul quest never looked back . thin man offered two unprecedented elements . firstly , film played up folks fun murder second , two leads portrayed wisecracking , happily wedded couple who witty , refined relished married . movies back then would normally their couples getting out marriage or ending up married finale . no one before actually explored realm hip happily wedded husband wife body film . mgm executives very nervous first preview film , unsure movie reception . but they needn't worried . van dyke knew what he wanted . he instructed albert hackett frances goodrich , husband-and-wife screenwriters , focus nick nora relationship pay lesser attention murder mystery . thin man series proven training ground young , up-and-coming actors . after thin man ( 1936 ) co-stars jimmy stewart , oozing his soon-to-be-patented aw-shucks sincerity , while shadow thin man ( 1941 ) features lovely , wholesome donna reed co-starring role . this first thin man , course , showcases gamine maureen o'sullivan . myrna loy recalled cast never allowed make friends various wire-haired terriers who played asta , it might distract thespian dogs . thin man doesn't refer nick charles but lanky , cranky inventor murder victim clyde wynan t.t here 72-episode thin man television series ( 1957-59 ) starring peter lawford phyllis kirk . before william powell immortalized nick charles , he played gentleman detective philo vance canary murder case ( 1929 ) , greene murder case ( 1929 ) , benson murder case ( 1930 ) kennel murder case ( 1933 ) . novel thin man dashiell hammett excellent short mystery novel . while not witty funny movie , it still very good read . unfortunately , unlike movie version , book never spawned sequel .	1
i loved " children corn " ! it wasn't scary , but characters especially intimidating . it also comes little bits both humor pity . example , humor mistakes made making . i could point out 5 first time i saw it ! there not much humor script . sad parts movie course when some people die . it sad when all parents adults die , because without them innocent children helpless . you can't help but feel little sorry isaac when he devoured " he who walks behind rows " , even though isaac bad guy . i would reccomend this movie someone who really nothing friday night wants evil kid action doesn't mind corny special effects . not put time off your schedule just watch this movie . it good movie only when it should , that when you hour half free time . also , don't see sequals ; they're absolutely , undeniably , stunningly terrible !!! you could probably watch them if you desperatly bored out your mind . anyway , first one best . besides some gorey parts , saddening child adult deaths , hokey movie resolution , this movie beatiful story mainly loving couple who meet two kids while driving throgh nebraska	-1

written fellow who gave world " monkeybone " ( sam hamm ) directed gentleman responsible " loony tunes : back action " ( joe dante ... okay , okay , he also " gremlins " ) , " homecoming " yet " masters horror " misfire . this time around , story concerns world where right-wing political pundits inadvertantly cause dead american soldiers come back life . david murch ( jon tenney ) jane cleaver ( thea gill doing her best anne coulter imitation ) offer up typical republican soundbites defense ( tactfully unnamed ) president ill-advised war iraq . one those soundbites ? " i wish those soldiers could come back , because i'm sure they'd tell america how proud they serve give their life this great country ours . " or something effect . what you know ? republicans get their wish . course , zombie soldiers aren't glad they're dead . what their idea vengeance ? they demand right vote against president . that right . soon their dissenting ballots cast , they drop lifelessly floor , their point made . this little vignette makes its point first seven minutes filming , then it just keeps making it over over again . some said your enjoyment show depend your political bent , but i think any clear-headed individual see no matter your governmental ideologies , this just one long , slow , poorly-written joke . there some dark humor here , but it also unintelligent , hateful , obvious . ah well . propaganda isn't known its tact . " homecoming " vendetta , that all it . i'm all exposing corruption deceit , but even if there those who agree this film message ( many , many ) , i fail see how those same people also agree film self-righteous moralizing , its hate , its presumption . after all , this little " screw you " current administration props up its high horse idea conservatives only promoting their own selfish agendas claiming speak america fallen men women . but " homecoming " guilty exact same offense . last frame , it obvious no one show aware self-defeating irony their proselytizing , which really only horrific thing this turkey	-1

i'm werewolf nut horror movie fan , but what really makes this movie characters their interactions . ginger bridgette very compelling poigiant . there few cliches , like hightened sexuality wolves experience . i didn't really like part it because it just too traditional but rest it wonderful . whole thing very unsettling stays you . how they deal gradual transformation interesting becasue she doesn't just start turning into violent sexual beast , if anything alters but enhances ginger personality . i highly recommend it	1
" antwone fisher " powerful moving film . i seen this film numerous time especially hbo it very true life . i imagine actual process antwone risking finding his " roots " coming terms his birth family based more than three psych sessions . there much said good psychotherapy . more african american women men suffer untold anguish keeping harsh realities life themselves under misconception " strong ! " while suffering illnesses mind . oscar winner , denzel washington impressive job his directorial debut . there many scenes which i enjoyed watching . they included beginning ( dreams little boy - check out gigantic-sized pancakes ! ) ending ( dreams turned into reality ) , which beautifully tied story together . addition directorial responsibilities , mr. washington continues show why he won oscar award successful all his acting roles . he strong presence this movie . all actors represented their parts well . actor , derek luke demonstrated why he so right part antwone fisher . he portrayed very real hear t-t ugging work . joy bryant who played part cheryl , antwone love interest , resembled ray sunshine screen . chemistry flowed well romantic characters . my favorite scene happened when young man finally confronted his mother her reaction towards him . priceless . novella nelson who played part mrs. tate , despicable character , deserves special mention . although we only see her few minutes , actress who played fisher mother gave outstanding performance . antwone fisher shouldn't overlooked , highly recommended my list .	-1

" conversation " little seen masterpiece francis ford coppola , made " godfather " " godfather pt . ii . " it mystery-drama , plays like horror movie similar nicolas roeg film " don't look now " sense works dread , rather than fright . two-time academy award winner gene hackman plays harry caul , wiretapper whom we first meet he recording conversation young couple park . caul sees his job job , he doesn't get involved people he records nor he pay much attention details conversation . he supposed record it deliver it . his suspicions begin grow tape when he tries personally deliver it mysterious person who asked it instead badgered man assistant ( harrison ford ) it . same time we begin realize how bad caul his job . his partner stanley ( john cazale ) quit already began working wiretapper . superintendent his apartment building managed get inside his multi-locked apartment drop off birthday present . ladyfriend his tells harry time she watched his spying someone hour ... it no wonder when rival wiretapper comes his office him he manages record intimant conversation harry woman . while mystery revolving around " conversation " continues , harry begins deciphering some sentences his suspicions confirmed when he hears sentence : " he'd kill us if he got chance ? " this question fuels rest movie , until very creepy superb climax . some most haunting parts film come end this due visuals film . one much-talked scene comes when harry flushes toilet motel room it begins overflowing blood . this scene ( few follow it ) some most effectively creepy scenes i've seen long time . gene hackman superb harry caul , multi-layered character page must seemed very one-dimensional . harry man no personal life , almost no friends , he man lives shrouded mystery . coppola already proved time this movie came out he cinematic genius , but he mostly known movies like " godfather " " apocalypse now . " those films 3 hour long epic films , but i think really see how much range coppola director it nice take look " conversation .

wow this bring back memories ! this probabely one movie i most obessed little kid . i watched it constantly acted it out my own my little pony toys . i bet my dad looks this movie dread now because i can't even count times i made him sit thru it play it out me ! he probabely still remebers each line heart ! " snooz coming ! snooz coming ! " silly .. sadly when i tried showing it children i babysit , they not too impressed . i suppose it only good children who grew up it toys because children i showed it simply not care seeing characters or even recognized them . seeing your favourite toy movie must its appeal when it first released 1980s . doesn't mean those kids i showed it didn't enjoy it completely though . they liked parts those 2 bratty witches , wanted see my old my little pony collection . i suppose it simply going one those movies only good during certain time . but what you expect ? it one those movies born out popular toyline . my little ponies making comeback now ( this time around they look cute , unlike their last comeback 1997-1999 ) , so this movie may interest those fans well . but those who don't like toys , it probabely won't . hence why i only gave it 4 stars	-1

i owned wild orchid quite few years beginning thought it bit out there . some it doesn't fit , some it doesn't make sense some it just plain dumb . reason i gave it 4 stars because i like mickey rourke . even though he look bit beat up this movie kind scary looking first slicked down hair he practically oozing sex . carre otis character , emily , seems bit aloof childlike . she bombarded scenes people sex abandoned building , watching 2 people sex limo . wheeler ( mickey rourke ) almost seems enjoy watching emily squirm bit . wheeler sort detached , but wanting someone he trust . its tough make sense this movie because honestly best part end . now i unrated version so it shows more than r-rating ( movie like this one - unrated or nc-17 way go)-the part where wheeler emily make love finally . it very arousing say least . i must give it zalman king . he knows how far go where movie gets into your mind , but yet he doesn't go gratuitous sex . i suggest delta venus , which zalman king experience	-1

one most impressive things criterion dvd label its willingness select offbeat challenging titles . film inclusion criterion collection , fact , almost guarantees it seen more diverse group viewers than might originally sought dvd out . this good thing , or bad thing , ( but usually good ) especially titles really only appeal specific target audience . such case experimental documentary " symbiopsychotaxiplasm . " i think individuals fascinated creative art filmmaking intrigued entertained -- specifically film students , scholars , theorists , documentarians , like . casual viewers , however , film appeal may somewhat limited -- so i recommend you know what you're getting into before you purchase this dvd . dvd set contains two films --" symbiopsychotaxiplasm : take one " " symbiopsychotaxiplasm : take 2 1/2 . " " take one , " shot 1968 , director william greaves takes full film crew new york central park . there he films various actors tackling fairly provocative script sex relationships . scenes depicted , over over , reminiscent second rate tennessee williams ' script their melodrama psychosexual dialogue . employing different cameras , he not only films actors , but himself , members crew , patrons park ( specifically those he feels represent some aspect what enacted ) . it chaotic set where no one really knows what going -- but it fascinating look process action . crew know greaves trying all-encompassing documentary , but differing opinions its intent or what form it should take . without greave knowledge , then , they start rebel -- filming meetings themselves debating merits theory behind greave vision ( or lack thereof ) . it messy look people who passionate film trying make sense what they doing . " take 2 1/2 , " we pick up much same way . first 40 minutes captures more footage shoot " take one . " second half , however , shows film finally released film festival -- 35 years later ! now participants who reunited still trying articulate significance " symbiopsychotaxiplasm . " greaves calls it metaphor vietnam , but no one else who involved make connection . after festival , greaves crew ( steve buscemi ) set out recreate experience . crew , knowledge project previous film , fail generate much passion or drama--they're just doing their jobs . what we get , however , extended sequence two actors really going improv get heart their characterizations . it might one most evocative depictions real actors working their craft i've ever seen . i know i've probably too descriptive ( or not enough , i don't even know) -- but films truly difficult describe . if you like film process ( or acting process ) watching it detail , this might useful film . if you like see or participate debate meaning film other aspects film theory , this film might stimulate your intellect . film also stands interesting , but not overt , look racism , sexism some other societal mores inherent sixties artistic community . i actually enjoyed these films , but recognize they not everyone . this experimental film no beginning or end , no major revelations or commentaries . everyone likely take something different out viewing experience -- so i'll leave you . kgharris , 02/07 .	-1

playtime depicts monsieur hulot day city . hulot ( jacques tati ) spends his day trying make appointment city , which takes place busy downtown paris very modern building wide windows , work cubicles , robot-like secretaries resembling flight attendants . hulot not quite meet his contact , his experience like cat mouse game . addition , through out film he comes across group stereotypical american tourists who hop off bus their cameras hand capture parisian landscape well natives city . indeed , playtime comedy absurd falls lines chaplinesque film meets warner brother cartoon . film quite humorous unusual . hulot seldom speaks clear language , but rather mumbles or grunts incomprehensible ; one watches , there no need subtitles because tati emphasizes characters ' actions rather than what they say . his trenchcoat , hat , pipe , umbrella , hulot carries charlie chaplin buster keaton tradition -- misfit-like character who happens go his business , but somewhere way , mayhem ensues . all day , hulot roams building , rides bus , end day , he ends up new nightclub full chaos funny business , which may resemble something out marx brothers film . playtime may depict hulot entire day . however , it obvious jacques tati , who also directed film , may attempting make social commentary state france during 1960s . particular , paris its relations western world -- united states . this modern paris always known place fun romance rather than consumerism or commercialism . however , playtime shows ever-changing paris its physical architecture romance world market . tourists visit super store , hulot ventures consumer-like convention where vendors promoting their wares . one brief significant scene film shows reflection eiffel tower window , later same window shows us capitol building . viewers watch film , one may observe hulot character part landscape , somewhat fixture imagination . nevertheless , playtime full humor , may interest viewers who like charlie chaplin or buster keaton type films little french twist .	1

this very entertaining dvd , full action very well constructed filmed battle scenes great scope . some ways film very timely considering there tension current western civilization america europe islamic world stretches across asia . i found it interesting film depicts those christians who tolerant multicultural diverse nation those christians not tolerant other religious beliefs . this film , balian ( played orlando bloom ) , his father , king jerusalem ( pitiful leper hiding behind silver mask ) represent those forces live diversity spiritual beliefs . templar knights represent those forces not live diversity multiculturalism it threatens them . this film , muslims powerful military force also diverse tolerance or non-tolerance christians . it beautiful film , fascinating architecture , set construction , weapon costume design . battle city jerusalem exciting , dramatic high point , critical aspect film . saladin wins battle jerusalem handed over muslims . remember after death jesus , apostles disciples spread christianity into egypt ethiopia , into rome , france , spain , england , ireland . also christianity spread into eastern europe such romania , hungary , germany . christianity spread into present day syria , jordan , iraq , iran . thus sweep islam across world around year 600 brought islam christian communities cities across middle east . it response this growing islamic power dominance over middle east 700 years crusades waged - which primary theme film . yet this not christians hate muslims who turn hate christians type film . instead writers film-makers imply kingdom heaven attainable here earth through belief tolerance other beliefs god . this actually good message our day time - which director ridley scott obviously knows	-1

i heard it said many times no addiction starts out physical dependancy ; addiction really begins psycological/spiritual defect deep down inside . i think way movie beginning showed insecurity unease two main characters most underrated aspect this brilliant film . alcohol washes away unease pain awhile , but when mask wears off , literally , all hell breaks loose !! some commented jack lemmon greenhouse scene subsequent mental-ward scene not realistic . i disagree this , i think his character mental state such complete breakdown very real possibility point story . ultimately , this film more than just story dangers alcoholism . it story dangers low self-esteem not loving yourself . true breeding ground addiction , i don't know if there ever film more effective job illustrating this !! absolute classic ... one ages !!	1

i really enjoyed this film . factory fan , i hesitant get this , perhaps due off-putting title . but i'm glad i . acting great , especially actor who played warhol himself - dead . also , ms. taylor 100% believable unfortunate , demented , freaky valarie solanas . i notice lot negative reviews this other films consist rant film worst they ever saw , waste 2 hours , etc ., but these folks never explain why they didn't like it . this true some bad reviews here . additionally , i'm not sure filmmaker harron not taking blantant stance against scum manifesto constitutes endorsment it ; rather opposite . it seems me solanas ' rants so out there crazy it isn't necessary say " hey , this wrong/bad/whatever . " her insane writtings speak themselves . why people need spoon fed obvious ? while not masterpiece ( hence 4 stars ) , this certainly good movie fascinating subject . it clearly not everyone , some reviews here illustrate . if you into warhol , 60 radicalism , art scene , or varried social movement called feminism , you'll like this movie . if not , this film not you	-1

anjelica huston , julianna marguelies joan allen bring life fabulous tale marion zimmer bradley . sterling performances engaging tale keep you glued your seats thorugh this seemingly short three hour saga . those who trouble book , this movie presents it well . while not completely true current arthurian research , tale captivating , presents window into world where struggle paganism christianity might taken place . facts show arthur merlin might much more christian oriented than mists avalon depict , but one imagine this struggle occur sometime , who , how when questions only answered imagination	1
singin rain arguably best movie musical all time , not just because music but because entire package - premise , comedy , characters - everything here works together make you feel better any time you sit down watch it . it ironic this movie thrown together quickly capitalize success " american paris " , since improvisational feeling movie one things makes it so much fun . although this film number ten top 100 films all time compiled american film institute , it wasn't nominated best picture year its release , 1952 . although it well box office , it would over twenty years before people would look back realize just what great motion picture it . perhaps because 1970 such bleak cynical years , movies largely matched mood , people eager rediscover fun motion picture viewing experience could . movie focuses period time which entire motion picture film industry nervous transition silent talking pictures . although movie compresses time this respect - transition actually took three years - it accurately describe technical problems era their comical aspects . there overabundance musicals first batch talking films , many stars heavy accents made their speech undecipherable or voices came across like nails chalkboard like lina lamont ( jean hagen ) saw their careers ruined , early sound technology itself so fragile you would often see actors speaking potted plants or coat racks comic effect . preview silent picture team lockwood lamont first talkie , " dueling cavalier " , one most hilarious scenes film . it pretty typical what you would see such early talking picture - dialogue going out sync , actors actresses strutting around wildly gesturing if nobody hear them , dialogue still resembled what you would read off title cards silent film - " i love you , i love you , i love you " . all this one reasons singin ' rain never get dated - it comic nostalgic look very narrow period time . this movie fun outside its comic take movie history , though . one , it hard say who steals show most , since there so many thieves involved . most notably there jean hagen - who actually very acceptable speaking voice - evil silent star who can't accept her days numbered . then there 27 year-old donald o'connor cosmo , studio music director sidekick gene kelly character whose youthful exuberance really shines number " make ' em laugh " all his goofy facial expressions . he seems much fun audience . finally , there all great dance numbers music , capped probably one most famous scenes all time - gene kelly rendition title number perfectly captures joy man who just fallen love feels he world his feet . you just can't watch this film not come away smile your face . it good soul chicken soup , just lot more fun .	1
this very good movie . great actors very good ending .	1
when i first saw this film 1982 , it reminded me one david lean epics . like lawrence arabia or dr. zhivago , it tells story nations political movements perspective single person . cast top notch , acting superb ( ben kingsley amazing this role ) , photography gorgeous . so it must-see film , but what dvd ? word , terrific ! sound color all look wonderful , extra features informative . i cannot say how this dvd edition compares one came out five years ago , but if you don't already own dvd copy this film , you won't disappointed this one	1

i'm fan miike , but _izo_ just too much . there no plot whatsoever , just poor unfortunate reincarted samurai wandering through time space killing everyone who crosses his path . that it ! end sentence ! if you think you stand over two hours this , give it try . if you're looking something even rudimentary plot , you might want try something else , like _audition_ or _ichi killer_ . i'd rather watch incomprehensible _gozu_ again than forced sit through _izo_ . it beautifully-photographed , but ultimately pointless film . maybe 6th or 7th other film miike directs this year more interesting	-1

we become world almost obsessed appearances . we lead believe if we look or dress certain way then we accepted who we . we all told " beauty only skin deep " but how many us really believe this way ? how many times you seen overly obese person grocery store cheetos pastries beer their cart thought yourself , " good job , tubby , keep it goin ' ... " i mean , i'm not putting myself up some golden pedastel , because i often made many judgments others simply because way they looked which kind makes me sad admitting this because i often judged way i looked growing up i totally resented those people who said stuff stuff just humiliate me try make me feel bad myself . no , i wasn't obese , but i very skinny . i stood 6'1 " weighed 105-106 whopping 107 if i didn't take dump day . you probably imagine ridicule i went through day day out . out frustration anger humiliation , i ended up working out . now you might say others ridiculing me turned out very positive experience . not positive you might think . i found these same people ridiculed me couple years before now wanted chummy me now i buffed incredibly good looking ... okay ... maybe i just buffed , but even though i appearance someone who strong confident , inside i still this insecure skinny kid who used run home school tears his eyes wondering why people didn't just like me who i . this movie really hit home both my wife myself because even though she grew up east coast i grew up west coast , our stories remarkably similar even though hers opposite . my wife incredibly beautiful woman inside well outside , but she weight " challenge " she still one . she very careful what she eats make sure she gets her exercise or pounds come back . but i love her her . she not her weight . she human deserves love , appreciation , respect . you might think this film hokey , it not terribly funny , but message very clear . look beyond what outer into inner soul person . there very touching scene i would like attempt describe before i go . hal ( jack black ) goes into hospital rosie ( gwyneth paltrow ) volunteer work . he under " spell " rosie most gorgeous woman he ever met he meets this little girl . he sees little girl tells her she prettiest little girl he ever met . she , very pretty little girl . after spell broken , he goes back into same hospital little girl goes , " hal ! hal ! don't you remember me ? " it same little girl but this time he sees her burn victim he witnesses all scars all over her body , " you told me i prettiest girl you'd ever seen ... " he holds her his arms , " you're right , princess , you ... you ... " under " spell " hal saw right through people into their heart ... their spirit ... their soul ... hal saw people they really . now you might think that load sentimental mush it this movie geared toward mushy side , but it really very important message we need hear over over again ; we not packaging ... we what inside ... even obvious sentimentality going this film , i some genuine belly ( no pun intended ) laughs goin ' . there scene where hal smears vaseline all over his eyes tells rosie , " uhhh ... i contagious conjunctivitis ... but i'll okay ... " i don't know why i thought so funny , but if there one thing jack black knows how very dry very understated . he actually very good choice this part . even when he " " , his humor very subtle just creeps up you you think back go , " wow ... funny ... " this movie same way . i found myself thinking certain parts just laughing . it good film it great message even though we all heard , " beauty eye beholder " million times our lives , we really need start acting though it truth , because it . it our light within makes us truly shine brightly . peace blessing	-1

i am quite new pilates though i've doing yoga daily past nine years . i'm finding pilates nice addition yoga it really works your body different but complementary way . i recently bought four dvd disc set stott i've " basics " previously this " flat ab " dvd today found them both excellent ! it bit long side , around 50 minutes , so it not quickie sort deal . it incredibly well chaptered , fact every exercise chaptered so you exercises you want if you don't feel like doing whole thing ( but warm ups really important before jumping into other exercises ) . i definitely aware my core during after doing this program , it definitely delivers it promise ! course if you overweight you need eat healthy lose weight order truly get flat abs , no amount exercise give you if you don't combine it good nutrition ( this something i've learned experience ) . however , you strengthen your core doing this program ! referring previous review this program , i didn't find it overly slow moving all , rather it paced way flowed but challenging . personally i don't like it when programs forcibly rushed sake saving time . i'd rather part program like this her pacing than rush through practice tries squeeze everything too quickly sacrifice good instruction form . there other programs out there shorter practices may appropriate someone who time conscious but what i've seen they just fewer exercises which grouped according body part you want focus rather than rushing through too many exercises while sacrificing form . anyway , i am very impressed this other stott program i've worked so far i'm looking forward trying other programs set	1

after reading sven nykvist just died i decided look fanny alexander again after 23 years . he cinematographer this film very interested capturing light darkness . this film quarter century old . our digital ideas film cinematography certainly changed well our morals . i just so carried away wonderful story delightfully unconventional , today standards , disfunctional family philanderers contrasted extrodinarily harsh fundamentalist protestant family contrasted family almost magical jews . i don't believe this film could remade today it pity our moral culture changed so .	1
this film version tale two cities masterpiece -- it faithful adapts dickens ' classic novel while holding out worthwhile movie its own right through incredible performances its lead actors . plot novel not touched -- filming dickens ' most tightly-plotted novel , good decision . acting uncommonly good . sydney carton fabulously ; james wilby commended wonderful nuanced performance . i also found madame defarge particularly well-done ; actress playing her scary ! considering mme . defarge character book , i think her almost insane bitterness sharp purpose well-portrayed . couple unique things this film include its use french actors play french characters british actors play british characters . no contrived accents , people actually look their nationality -- both important such highly political story . i also strongly support decision carton darnay played different people ; yes , they're supposed look alike , but not identical . different actors play them facilitates portrayal their very contrasted characters . i am admittedly coming perspective one who read loved book years before seeing movie ; i can't judge what this film would like someone who never read novel . but i found it accurate sensitive adaptation book i know love , i imagine beauty story would appeal just easily someone experiencing story first time	1

john ford filmmaker who much praised many derided good many others . chief criticism seems lie his treatment indians sterotypical inferiors , prone same type predictable behaviour film after film . most strange , ford always used white man chief indian his films . i tend find this criticism accurate . i also find certain his westerns lack gritty realism , say , peckingpah work , border preposterous . ford use exterior settings , however , peerless , rock monolith bordering his town tombstone " my darling clementine " ( 1943 ) awe inspiring . i wouldn't rate ford top ten , but i'd rank this film among great westerns considered american classic . course , this telling " shootout ok corral " earps ( henry fonda , ward bond ) doc holliday ( victor mature ) versus clantons ( walter brennan ) . some reason , westerns fonda quieter resonance than most i really like this . i give john ford credit this one . it filled many fine , small details - acting seems more subdued , even little melancholy - yet he uses vast space arizona desert only ford , without peer . use title song played qiuetly background , , even better , hummed time time henry fonda . fonda different wyatt earp than ones we've seen fairly recently " tombstone " ( 1993 ) " wyatt earp " ( 1994 ) , less violent , more gentleman , , film progresses , somewhat shy admirer doc holliday old girl friend ( clementine , course ) back east . fonda played " ox-bow incident " " clementine " within one year time period , , though he primary character these two films , he also blended adroitly lot other very good actors actresses . tip hat him well ford . i don't believe ford version earp saga very accurate , but , when movie this well , who cares ? final scene memorable its downcast last meeting wyatt clementine , when they finally express little their feelings each other , fonda kisses her cheek , then rides off , dissolving into immensity arizona landscape . almost bought tear my eye . john ford directed many good great films inspite above reservations , but this john ford his absolute best	1

when i first saw first x-men movie i highly impressed special effects , but plot nearly bored me tears . but i can't say x2 : x-men united . this outing , there several good plots here , all them leading spectacular action scenes . chief among these william stryker ( advisor president ) his plan kill off all mutants : first initiating attempt president life more than it seems first , then using knowledge he gains magneto , who imprisoned his all plastic cage since end first movie . once he knows all cerebro , professor xavier special computer locating mutants , he then captures professor forces him attempt kill all mutants . plot involves wolverine attempt learn his past stryker . trying learn his past , wolverine encounters vicious female version himself equipped his own powers regeneration claws boot . his battle her not missed . there yet plot where magneto attempts turn stryker plan around kill all humans instead mutants . all these elements more fit beautifully together this film where we introduced new characters like nightcrawler pyro , we see loss (?) one core x-men characters . this much better movie than it predecessor -- 135 minute , nearly two half hours -- it much longer movie , too , but one that well worth watching . it would nice if few lose ends tied up , but i guess then there wouldn't anything sequel you just feel coming .	1

probably most over-looked trois couleurs trilogy , principally because it one middle different tone bleu rouge , trois coleurs blanc bleak comedy inequality troublesome relationships . karol karol , played sublime bemusement zbigniew zamachowski , serious trouble his soon-to-be ex-wife dominique ( ice-maidenly julie delpy ) . she his bank account frozen , left him nothing . so karol goes back his homeland poland begins plot fiendish revenge . three colours white probably more common kiewslowski tv series morality plays , dekalog [ worth your attention ! ] than it other two films series . it less stylised , filmed straightforward , almost documentary style it - like couple those dekalog shorts - grim , dark comedy ethics . kieslowski always maintained he no great moralist . he didn't claim any answers way people lived their lives ; he just found subject interesting liked ask questions himself his audiences . this , part , what gives his films their deep humanity . white bursting humanism . decision film it more straightforward style apparently came because kieslowski acknowledge colour white most difficult film , so notion building symbolic colour-scheme around it ( he blue red other two films ) seemed too difficult . this indicative his technical ability director , which despite less " showy " schemata white still oozes out screen . this great director top his game . comedy three colours white [ trzy kolory bialy polish , way , language film mostly ] mostly comes its absurd plo t-t wists , which heaped top each other until you can't help but laugh ... but emotions very real , very recognisable even while you're guffawing idea man going france poland suitcase someone he hardly knows . while i think it would fair say this middle installment not impressive blue or red it still very thoughtful , very clever piece film-making most writers directors would give their right-arm involved . it takes sideways look its theme - white french flag represents " liberty " - gives discerning viewer pause reflection . kieslowski not spoon-feed his audiences , even rather straightforward narrative such this , so viewer left make up his or her own mind certain things . example : dominique love karol after all ? it excellent european cinema its influence seen many works followed since - surprisingly enough perhaps work lars von trier , who also goes uncomfortable laughs , occasional absurdism slantwise looks morality ethics . extras disc also worth . it fascinating see kiewslowski talk his life his work such detail ( he didn't leave anything his movies chance deeply thoughtful man . shame he didn't think quitting chain-smoking , he may lasted longer ! ) adds your enjoyment his work . this well worth taking look .	-1

this movie pretty awful . since i am ranking it 1 star , then according reviewer i must not soul . hey , it doesn't feel bad ! this movie worst black stereotyping any movie i ever seen , particularly sci-fi movie . it worse than blaxploitation films 70 , which least entertaining . this movie group teenage white kids , one token black thrown just hell it . " but just how ' black ' he ?, " you may wondering . well movie makes it clear he true soul man because it goes out its way establish these facts : 1 . he talks different whites . ( " hey bodee . " " his name bodhi ! " " well you say it your way , i'll say it mine . " or something effect . ) 2 . he breakdances . ( we all know all black people breakdance , can't they ? )3 . he likes basketball . ( again , every white person knows black people all like basketball they all good it , right ? )4 . he raps . ( because person isn't truly black unless they little hip-hop , they ? )i'm white guy . i'm not overly sensitive racism issues . but watching this movie really surprised me . i amazed see such blatant black stereotype . i can't say it good thing . it quite embarassing watch , actually . what where they thinking ? this movie would never made way today day age . movie itself pretty lame . it made back roller-blading / cyberpunk craze 80 . it usual bleak dystopian future typical those movies those days . it also features funky little ball named bodhi . it weirdest , most nonsensical story i ever watched . it almost like bad dream somebody wrote down soon they woke up , which later worked into screenplay . this movie so stupid it painful watch . only good reason see it see few young actors such jason patric ( lost boys ) jami gertz ( lost boys , twister , still standing ) . it also nice see richard jordan ( logan run ) , well stunning sarah douglas ( superman ii , conan destroyer ) starring villainess roll , usual . sarah douglas really make good villain , too . it too bad her talent so wasted this crapfest movie . " sphere longiness " ? ech ! i don't understand all you people who giving this movie 5 stars . i mean , what you thinking ? it just " i love 80 " nostalgia-factor kicking . i don't see any other rational reason this phenomenon . please . skating overgrown road ? skating dirt ? they'd get 10 feet before rock stuck their skates they went flying . it might fun watch if you make yourself believe rollerblades work sand . i'd say , other dystopian future skating flick , " prayer rollerboys " much better movie than this . course ain't saying much , because movie pretty much stinks too . buy something else . anything else . if not yourself , then least show black people world little basic human respect	-1

this achingly intense visually stunning movie one my favorites years . role tristan made pitt , aidan quinn stands out yet again wonderful , versatile , underrated actor he . julia ormond beautiful refined her role love interest all three brothers painfully convincing she descends into insanity . isabel two not given much speaking role , but i found her one my favorite characters actresses played her both child woman lovely . anthony hopkins ... well ... anthony hopkins . he perfect idealistic , knarly old patriarch his obvious favortism his middle son explains lot what motivates other two . earlier poster mentioned , timeline this movie little confusing , there few editing oversights ( brad hair kept changing same scene ) , but none it took away breathtaking cinematography some stellar acting . i thought voice-over indian chief very effective helped create ' atmosphere ' movie . soundtrack rich , haunting , agonizingly beautiful . music alone practically hypnotized me . legends fall brutal , beautiful , dark journey into madness leave you breathless emotionally exhausted end , but i found it definitely worth ride	-1

even though hollywood-driven glorification derrida superhero philosophy annoying -- if not furiating times , video , however , suceed unveiling fundamental character traits philosopher . namely , documentary revealed derrida reserved himself idiotic probing into his personal sex life which , needless say if granted , editors/director would exploit marketing stupified masses ( same masses who only buy-into dramatized or " controversial " ) . reason alone - derrida himself recognized this , counter it , distanced himself exploitative questions - it worth watching . since i not read any derrida work yet , i simply not say anything his philosophy . however , overly sensationalized/dramatized voice reading passages derrida philosophy offer some incredible insight into his thoughts .	1

i often heard people say all family could never produced today . i think this true , least , network television ( nbc , abc , cbs , fox ) . all family captures specific moment both television american history . carroll o'connor excellently renders american bigot , archie bunker , puts him up scrutiny before live audience . all family not entirely political correctness bigotry , but when you look back show , those social forces remain reasons why it couldn't produced today . six feet under , uncensored , would certainly no chance broadcast either . politically correct imperative contemporary american culture would sue complain it " wardrobe malfunction . " malfunction , however , emotional intellectual dishonesty most tv shows today , most mainstream culture today . i think almost all television cartoon . i like six feet under because it not not turn its homosexual characters into prancing man-boys grace . violence six feet under well earned integral drama comedy series . sex human relationships six feet under complicated weird , which completely normal . mostly , it refreshing watch show cares story character instead explosions , statutory sex objects , impossibly melodramatic events . if all family reflects political awakening , taught through comedy , then six feet under reflects response political correctness . bigotry all family responds monolithic misanthropic political correctness six feet under responding . bigotry political correctness merely two sides same dishonesty ; they rules codes human behavior expression not work out real life . archie bunker certainly not subtle guy , but his assumptions people different him wrong ( funny ) . now , when everything subtle politically correct eggshells , people no longer honest . that what six feet under me : we need relearn how trust others enough honest , i think six feet under accurately argues not all honesty mean , avoiding confrontation isn't always nice . end , hbo six feet under what networks used : respect intelligence , maturity , humanity audience	1

its not often nowadays we get chance see tour de france without complete focus exploits lance armstrong , rider extraordinaire , triathlete , marathoner , etc . etc . while i respect admire armstrong accomplishments much next fan , this movie isn't lance . likewise , its not phil paul their increasingly tiresome oln coverage . so what hell wheels all ? its german film ( yes , german but clearly visible english subtitles ) follows telekom boys during 2003 tour de france , epic battle fore-mentioned lance jan ullrich ( who incidentally rode bianchi year ) . lance jan appear frequently but not principal characters . tyler hamilton ( who rode entire race broken collarbone ) andreas kloden ( who rode few stages broken coxyx also figure side characters . primary characters rolf aldag , erik zabel ( roomates ) their masseuse/assistant eule , grizzled old guy who looks like he seen his share riders come go . race footage , we hear older gentleman who appears spent little too much time tour archives he narrates great black white footage very first years . although he little out there , he lends french flair film . exhilarating takes tdf stages , beginning end , we see riders recovering , musing day performance , suffering fallout daily crashes , mountain stages , etc . we often hear erik rolf talking over race eule works out kinks massage table . zabel particular some soul searching he just can't seem come up sprint win . aldag takes mountain jersey , but next day cracks , showing us just how fleeting victory tdf - how phenomenal winners really . prepared stunning footage mountain stages where we see just how tough these stages bikers . camera work magnificent - integrating fixed television-style feed hand-held shots give viewer perspectives we never get oln or any other tv coverage . my favorite scene alps when armstrong , ullrich , mayo flash arm length - showing how incredibly fast these riders go up mountain passes . while non cyclists may or may not enjoy drama tour , cyclists definitely groove racing footage . euro-pop sound track plenty solid bass sounds great dolby surround all class . i've watched video movie used it while trainer - either way its great buy ! gte it yourself or your favorite cyclist - they'll love it	1

i watched this documentary pbs i must say it one best ones i seen my whole life . it extremely disturbing too , because it sadly reminds us what human still capable . murder almost one million lives couple weeks shame whole mankind . international community nothing stop killings , un always deplorable soi-disant civilised world , i.e. usa , france , uk , belgium , germany et alii , not mind intervene political reasons , although time usa marines nearby burundi . clinton administration kofi annan(at time chief peace keeping operations ) absolutely nothing concrete but uttering stupid , useless rhetorical technical speeches . not mention shameful , coward stance belgian government panicked withdrew its troops citizens . real heroes bunch canadian african troops their very best protect remaining tutsis moderate hutus therefore deserve our biggest praises all their efforts . again , it one more appalling moment human history . it seems we never learn . among scenes shocked me forever sad images dead bodies drifted away rwandan river little girl , nowadays lady , found alive among dead bodies her family . this dvd provides wonderful opportunity think over sordid noxious nature european colonialism africa , after all , rwanda belgian colony belgian fomented apartheid tutsis hutus through , among other things , use id cards stating their ethnicity . it also shows dangers hands-off policies when intervention morally rightly justified required . this must-have dvd . please , let us not allow rwanda happen again ..	1
i could not help but watch this film all my african american female sensibilities . despite proficient acting , cinematography directing , i found content highly offensive trite . mr. kinksy claimed love shanduri willing anything possess her affections . he put off find out shanduri married , but not deterred . shanduri gave him what she believed unattainable challenge her husband , who arrested speaking out against government , freed african prison . i recognize it possible servant fall love her employer , however i know it extremely rare . ( ask any black woman who cleaned white person house , `how much love you your boss . ' relationship shanduri mr. kinksy one abuse power emotional manipulation . during `relationship ' i watched develop , not once shanduri refer her employer his first name . clearly indicating uneven balance power control ... not much different slave owner offering free his children born his african concubine . so , mr. kinksy gave up some his prized possessions ; it european influence created climate allowed shanduri husband detained indefinitely . though i am one among several different review film , i no reason forget long history abuse past present women color experienced hands white people , especially white men . see such film insult example how europeans not understand masses african americans	-1

some may think supernatural stories played out . we've plenty here states we're getting much more overseas . what i love each these movies they're not so repetitive . you get tired seeing same thing over over again , but these kind thrillers we always get something different . sure ghosts there but stories different way characters presented what makes each film stand alone . there some many movies i name which carry same overall topic but each those movies you see stores different each other one way or . you don't watch these movies scares even though it fun scared . you just sit down watch it story relationships characters . heirloom me one those movies . sure it movie unknown supernatural force but it films story draws you . heirloom isn't really scary i don't believe it made scary movie . what makes heirloom so great powerful plot twists you figure out you go . heirloom tells story man who inherits old family house . he checks place out he decides move bring his fianc ? . they stay house man slowly begins remember parts his childhood , bringing back old memories forgotten age . house dark history , which thirty years prior entire family attended bizarre rituals ended up committing suicide all same time . each relative hung rope die . while man unaware his family history he begins witness some strange happenings involving old house . friends appearing house out nowhere others killed off weird mysterious causes . it house itself or there something evil going ? we soon find out couple dig deeper into family history what really went thirty years ago . now this movie definitely worth watching . story great even though not all it original . but way it played out scene scene different when you figure out mystery behind everything it not pleasant all . heirloom features one most disturbing plot turns i've ever seen . it not graphic but idea everything so twisted wrong story just completely drives you . heirloom very dramatic horror film heart pounding mystery , likeable characters good story all around . plot dialog movie what really makes it good watch . it so long since i've bothered twist heirloom really good job letting story unfold dialog disturbing flashbacks . most movie we fallow couple who try find out mystery behind house all weird events taken place over last week . overall subject deals family curses , punishments characters who deal same fate . movie beautifully shot , using different views inside house give it more creepy feeling house itself large contains dark history . lot scenes blend together flash backs tell story give it more questionable approach what answer everything . like most mysterious you don't get know everything until near end . which also when we get see more these flashbacks , near end explains it all . overall look heirloom also really good . art design fantastic you really believe characters staying old house . nothing looks too fake or obvious . locations fine spice things up film also simple yet perfectly fitting score . music sets up mood each scene should enough draw your attention . heirloom well made good looking film which i really recommend watching . also sure check out bonus features understand more making it . if you want see movie scare living daylights out you , then look somewhere else . heirloom isn't kind movie watch scares , or blood guts matter . like many movies involving supernatural mysteries heirloom plot dialog driven film . using story characters set mood you guessing until end . but trust me when i say it not pleasant . there no happy endings or events this picture . story very dark unsettling times . watch heirloom mystery , not action or huge body count . if you sit down pay attention all way through then you rewarded . it good movie doesn't supply scares blood get viewers attention . there plenty drama mystery	-1
i understand every generation desire remake or reinterpret classic dramas , plays literature , this case , henry james psychological ghost story , " turn screw . " however , 21st century filmmakers should know now : modern newer not necessarily better . less more producers should realized when they considered this remake . outstanding remarkable 1961 adaptation " innocents " ghosts or apparitions most part seen briefly distance . music , sound effects , stunning cinematography made apparitions children precocious behavior even more chilling disconcerting . this drama doesn't work following reasons : ghosts revealed close-up , realistic lingering shots . they neither mysterious nor frightening . children unappealing not terribly convincing ; other words very badly cast . most surprisingly , very talented jodhi may who should perfect this role somehow simultaneously grim blank beginning ; she gives us little insight into her character . overall , this disappointing adaptatio	-1

" ronin " sets out telling viewer some samurai warriors who shamed when their lord killed , via treachery , lord . this made them " ronin " - or rogues . movie itself bore scant resemblance legend it quoted -- which only one its shortcomings . robert deniro phones performance , though jean reno creditable job his ally vincen t.t he film follows formation mysterious , multi-national gang criminals hired mysterious irish woman retrieve mysterious silver case . gang doesn't know what case , who they working or each other . there lots gunplay , plenty car chases , faintly interesting locales french riviera paris , lots collateral damage civilians . what seems propel movie lack clarity motives gang members purpose their activities . seemingly , this intended writers , who wanted show criminals ( or they ? ) furiously fighting dying cause they not understand , long lucrative reward awaited them . viewer , however , unfolding drama only reason keep watching this dud film . all its vaunted samurai connections , ronin disappointing . car chases dull seemed interminable . accidents caused thereby ludicrously overdramatic , lots flying sparks gasoline explosions . gunfights ridiculously one-sided . end film , silver case changed hands so many times movie started look like comedy routine .

this documentary uses interviews trace origins linux , process , it provides interesting insight into open source movement its philosophy . richard stallman , founder gnu project , featured prominently throughout film . ( gnu set applications provide unix-compatible framework . ) he explains how gnu developed through open source environment , environment where code taken , modified , shared , but it cannot made proprietary . he also explains development gnu general public license which prohibits developers making code proprietary . during gnu development , linus torvalde , developing kernel -- which just piece missing open source environment . ( kernel use allocate resources other applications . ) this kernel became linux . stallman said , it would take years get gnu linux work together smoothly , but eventually things would take off . although linux started 1991 10,000 lines code , it might remained hobbyist os , if it not apache web server . apache became ' killer app , ' business case buying linux . ( there interview shown brian behlendorf , president apache project . ) 1998 , linux 7.5 million users companies like red hat contributing its growth selling distribution suppor t.t his film also shows tug-of-war microsoft open source proponents . eric . raymond , author cathedral bazaar , describes some differences proprietary open source environments , he explains how his book one many influences netscape decision release their source code . you see interviews michael tieman ( co-founder cygnus technology ) larry augustin ( co-founder va linux ) . interview bruce perens , author open source definition , interesting . it used throughout film frame gnu linux development stories within open source context . also , perens lists ' rights ' open software , one senses open source philosophy one seriously thought out . overall , this interesting documentary . however , i'm giving it only 4 stars because i found segment end ( where torvalde augustin speaking ) very tedious . it didn't add content it seemed more like personal ' grand-standing . ' still , i'd recommend this film anyone who interested computer history or looking get better understanding what open source movement	-1

universal soldier one best action films jean claude van damme . film released 1993 . movie based awfully chilly idea secret government project use reanimated corpses dead soldiers universal soldiers . these soldiers really killer combat zombies programmed receive commands remotely . they extremely efficient killer machines impervious pain , quick heal , pretty much unstoppable although they tend overheat if they stay active too long . this movie , jean-claude van damme stars man who supposedly killed war vietnam . he revived secret biochemical , regenerative experiment cyborg controlled people who made him . project initially proceeds according plan . however , van damme starts recalling memories series flashes his past , he eventually remembers bloodthirsty , psychotic vindictive sergeant ( dolph lundgren ) , who also now turned into cyborg , evil core . fight them resumes where they left when they alive . action really gets hot when van damme regains his memory eventually leads his freedom controlled his creators . but creators not prepared let van damme go free without them doing everything they get him back under their control once again . both jean-claude van damme dolph lundgren play their respective roles exceptionally well . pretty sexy alley walker , who plays reporter who joins van damme his fight against universal soldier , also gives good performance . those who love action movies thrilled fierce fist fights , unforgettable stunts kickboxing action compel you watch it again again . i recommend anybody who likes van damme movies or good action movies get " universal soldier .

first , i don't think edward norton made bad film . he definitely doesn't disappoint here either . very clever role paul giamatti well . this movie prestige wanted . all its big name actors , i think it overshadowed illusionist just bit . prestige leaves us stunned thinking magicians possess supernatural powers , but that not what we want believe . we're satisfied because magicians gave away few secrets , but not ones we wanted them . illusionist tricks us much same way , but doesn't create hype going above beyond realm real magic . we still stunned , but we still told it only trick . we believe it . beautiful cinema . superb acting . excellent music score . excellently paced well . i wasn't bored . prestige , i felt like they could trimmed it little without taking away film , but it still distracting . illusionist grabs your full attention doesn't let go . we get good show , enough it leaves you wanting more . just magic show should ! good illusion	1
it fantastic movie when it first released it still just good . great photography , good narrative . makes me long summer days i used spend beach santa cruz	1

since today 9-11 , before i begin my review , i would like take this opportunity express my condolences families their loved-ones who lost their lives fateful horrific day 9-11 . time heals but you never forget . ( i know i won't i wasn't even there . ) j.l. i doing review classic " jimi plays monterey/shake ! otis monterey " originally released 1967 two rock ' roll greatest legends , late great jimi hendrix ( born 26 november 1942 , died 18 september 1970 ) jimi hendrix experience late great otis redding . ( born 9 september 1941 , died 10 december 1967 ) i also editing this review time time so you consumer get best most accurate review possible . first , jimi hendrix . what i say this legendary guitarist hasn't already said ? my opinion , johnny allen hendrix ( original name before his father al hendrix changed it james marshall hendrix . ) forever go down history greatest guitarist rock ' roll ever produced . maybe i should add more statement . jimi hendrix forever go down music history greatest guitarist ever picked up instrument . please remember hard it seems believe , guitarist myself , jimi hendrix " self taught " guitarist . nobody taught jimi play way he . then it dawned me , nobody this world could ever taught jimi how play guitar way he . jimi hendrix born god-given gift naturally pick up instrument just teach himself how play guitar , simple . jimi hendrix so far ahead his time it took years before his well-respected contemporaries would catch up him . jimi hendrix complete guitarist , playing both rhythm lead guitars consistently well while handling singing duties . most bands nowadays separate lead singer , rhythm guitarist lead guitarist . there many great guitarists passed through rock ' roll history ; legendary guitarists such chuck berry , late great eddie cochran , late great buddy holly , late great ritchie valens , peter green , eric clapton , jeff beck , jimmy page , santana , robin trower , keith richards , dave davies , peter frampton , pete townshend , ritchie blackmore , late great stevie ray vaughn , joe perry , angus young , late great terry kath , late great randy rhodes , joe satriani frank marino . i'm sure there many other legendary guitar greats i failed mention i apologize . but jimi hendrix guitarist ( man ) re-wrote rules how guitar would played . hendrix also rewrote rules how guitar would presented out front lead reckoned instrument . hendrix would become extremely well known playing guitar his teeth , behind his head , behind his back his legs . what guitarist doing this prior hendrix ? hendrix even popularized instrument even more than his past predecessors . i mean no disrespect any way past guitar greats , especially blues greats . i don't believe any legendary guitar greats whether they played blues , country or rock ever deny accomplishments jimi hendrix such short time . ( two half years ) most guitarists almost take their whole career accomplish what jimi just two half years . many rock critics well certain friends believe jimi , like blues great robert johnson mighty led zeppelin , sold his soul devil exchange greatest guitarist ever lived . this statement true or it myth ? i leave up you decide . enough , lets get review . " jimi plays monterey " quite simply , " rock history making ! " this concert also marks jimi first u.s. appearance . ( jimi , native american , two british musicians named noel redding bass mitch mitchell drums , became star england before he became star his own country . ) this performance single-handedly gave birth ultimate performance lifetime jimi hendrix experience . all legendary rumors backstage talk took place jimi hendrix pete townshend who which band wasn't going follow other , i highly recommend 1992 released book simply entitled , " monterey pop , " written joel selvin great photos veteran rock photographer jim marshall . selvin researched backstage moments hendrix townshend finally answers questions quoted page 92 , third paragraph : backstage , pete townshend who angrily confronted jimi hendrix . townshend accused hendrix stealing his act ( hendrix admitted he but made it better ) , two continued arguing back forth who would follow who . townshend still smarting experience followed hendrix earlier year london saville theatre . legend it , front legendary contemporary spectators such eric clapton , brian jones janis joplin , late john phillips mama papa get separate two artists resolve matter flip coin . who won toss who went first . jimi hendrix quoted saying after coin toss , " if i follow who , then i'm going pull all stops . " eric burden animals quoted saying during introduction who : " i promise you this group who calls themselves who destroy you more ways than one . " who took stage bad intentions performed blistering set which resulted total destruction their instruments end . who crazily leaving stage , pete townshend quoted telling jimi , " follow ! " according book " monterey pop " page 94 , second paragraph : real mopping up chores left up grateful dead , thrust who hendrix , barely enough time get warmed up . when hendrix company took stage sunday evening ( june 18 , 1967 ) , he easily literally proceeded blowing every band ( including who ) off stage . hendrix performed nine songs night follows : ( 1 . ) " killing floor " ( howlin ' wolf classic performed excellent ! hendrix arrived ! ) , ( 2 . ) " foxey lady " ( awesome ! ) , ( 3 . ) " like rolling stone " ( hendrix great tribute bob dylan ) , ( 4 . ) " rock me baby " ( b.b. king classic , this song truly rocks ! ) , ( 5 . ) " hey joe " ( excellent ! ) , ( 6 . ) " you see me " ( excellent rocker ! ) , ( 7 . ) " wind cries mary " ( beautifully crafted poetic , well written well performed . ) , ( 8 . ) " purple haze " ( excellent ! this song leave you " haze " " daze . " ) ( 9 . ) " wild thing . " ( troggs classic song performed jimi hendrix way . american british anthems . quite simply , one rock finest moments during one rock finest hours history ! you see dvd believe it . ) hendrix performance new dawn day rock ' roll history . rock ' roll finally grown up matured no longer diapers . rock ' roll finally artistic something say . it probably best gods ( i'll always love never say anything bad my heroes beatles , rolling stones beach boys ) not appear monterey because there new gods ( jimi hendrix experience , otis redding , who , janis joplin steve miller ) born . i hendrix fanatic since i eight years old 60 i practically own just every vinyl , cassette , vhs cassette , cd dvd hendrix . i also own just every hendrix bootleg that ever come out . i always highly recommend this concert part any teenager musical education especially since it part american history . i don't think i continue telling you how great this concert really . enough said , now its otis redding turn . i apologize not leaving very much this review otis redding . ( no disrespect otis or otis redding estate . ) all i say otis redding his performance monterey simply " magical ! " according book " monterey pop " pages 79-81 , redding performance excellent ! otis performed his trademark songs such " i've loving you too long " ( great song early rolling stones ike tina turner favorite . ) , " respect " ( hit song queen soul aretha franklin ) , " try little tenderness " ( breathtaking ! ) rolling stones hit single " satisfaction . " ( otis redding way , excellent ! ) only bad part otis redding legend according book " monterey pop " page 81 end paragraph one : redding would not live long enough savor fruits or fame his successful performance monterey very long . six months later , twenty-six-year-old soul giant would die plane crash icy waters wisconsin lake . few short years later , jimi would follow . what major loss rock ' roll soul music history . over all , this dvd set excellent worth every penny . closing , this dvd set not just important part our lives , but important moment part american history . thanks reading my long review i hope you enjoyed reading it much i enjoyed writing it all you . i also hope you read all my other reviews when time permits . long live rock ' roll ! rock out always . take care , j.l.	1

i've sat through more than my fair share pretentious films my attempt escape hollywood drivel . based cast strength film maker , i thought holy smoke would good script , strong performances something say . indeed , film began much promise , only bogged down what i would call awful second dreadful third act . how characters get point point beyond me certainly not motivated what shown screen . if this movie designed question roles men women religious circles , question physical vs . mental domination relationships , or question choices vs . others ' perceptions those choices , it would worthwhile use kodak film . end , film suffers too many ideas , too little cohesion too much self-importance . i would suggest avoiding this film , almost much i would avoid gigli .	-1

" well , i've seen film four times now my respect grows each viewing . i certainly see why some don't like it or don't ' get ' it : " generations " some ( apparent ) plot holes some things aren't spelled-out or explained very well ( so what ? doesn't mystery intrinsically come territory space adventure ? ) ; plus story just plain convuluted . regardless , i feel " generations " ambitious , high-concept sci-fi highest order ; it leaves viewer many interestng questions ponder long afterwards . although nexus beeen criticized mere gimmick get kirk picard together , i find concept utterly fascinating : no matter how much we want it , illusory paradise just -- illusion . far i'm concerned , concept nexus its implementation into storyline nothing short brilliant . besides this , there incredible number highlights : usual trek humor , data amusing experiences emotion chip , malcolm mcdowell outstanding performance mad soran , soran believable obsession justifications , b'etor lursa their " wild bunch " klingons , startling obliteration them their vessel , thrilling crash-landing enterprise-d , meeting kirk picard nexus , final showdown soran kirk death ( disregarding lame " oh my " ) . needless say , " generations " far more than offer mere juvenile space battles . biggest plot hole ( or maybe not ): picard purpose leaving nexus stop soran annihilating enerprise-d crew entire veridian solar system , including 230 million people live veridian iv . since picard leave nexus " go anywhere any time , " guinan pointed out earlier , why go veridian iii minute before soran launches his rocket ? why not go back when soran guest enterprise-d apprehend him then there ? writer ronald . moore defended picard decision grounds he didn't want risk dangerous unexpected consequences occur when tampering timeline ; hence , his journey back time nexus only matter minute or so . hmmm , it good explanation i accept it . second biggest plot hole : if soran rocket-probe powerful enough effect quantum implosion veridian star , would it not cause quite bit more damage veridian iii when it explodes ? surely both picard ( who merely hides behind rock outcropping ) kirk would utterly obliterated entire immediate surroundings planet ? explanation : some criticized fact guinan simultaneously present real world nexus . how could this ? it simple : it repeatedly established reality experienced nexus not real ; one experiences what they desire nexus , not what real . instance , picard no children real world , but because he desired them he able experience them nexus . hence , ' guinan ' portrayed nexus may walk , talk act precisely like guinan , but she not real . she only there because picard desires her there purpose explaining nature nexus . capeesh ? commentary nexus : although nexus should simply taken face value strange space phenomenon , one also regard it analogy . first glance one might get impression nexus type heaven , but this can't so since it repeatedly emphasized film people events experiened nexus not real . ' heaven , ' term theologians ministers traditionally use refer eternal abode redeemed ( technically referred " new heavens new earth " bible ~ 2 peter 3:13 ) , -- contrast -- always depicted real bible , not illusory paradise . if nexus not analgous heaven , what could it type ? nexus corresponds any addiction person " tastes " embraces escape reality ( e.g. drugs , alcohol , computer games , tv , porn , fishing , shopping , golf , etc . ) some , like soran , unable flee its clutches waste their lives talents obsessed it . others , like picard kirk , able see truth escape ; they therefore " make difference " real life . bottom line : this " passing-of-the-torch " installment requires attention span appreciation high-concept sci-fi ; it bore tears those whom star trek only means neato spacecrafts superficial space dogfights ( don't get me wrong , they each their place star trek ) . " generations " courage make bold changes -- killing off major iconic character , fairly prominent support characters well , not mention destroying enterprise-d . " generations " science-fiction grown-ups youth advanced cerebral development . all others should stick star wars " zathura " ( giggle ) .	1

hornblower fan many decades , i am very disappointed this movie . ioan gruffud portrays hornblower who almost modern high school delinquent - kind who walks front your car when you drive near public hs show he " cool " or " big man " . whereas this may appeal someone who sports " question authority " sticker , it not hornblower i know . overall , it seems movies not too well one greatest heroes fiction - but least gregory peck hornblower decent - this one not quite material which commodore hornblower made ... kind person portrayed gruffud , above all , childish ( we all know , " cool " same " cute " ) . perhaps other ones this ioan gruffud better , but these two bad enough they keep me buying others	-1

legend rita generally excellent film . rita vogt belongs small faction terrorists who rob banks commit other crimes " support revolution " 1970s west germany . get-go , movie fast-paced exciting , robberies fights among terrorists highlighted quick scene changes . rita , fleeing west german police , ultimately takes refuge east germany then given " legends , " i.e. , identities , disguise her presence country . although character completely fictional , rita appears resemble , both physically otherwise , red army faction member susanne albrecht , who given asylum new identity east germany ( although albrecht not participate jailbreak . ) rita idolizes east germany pleased live " true socialist state " - position becomes untenable after wall falls 1989 . film strikes note truth it contrasts east germany seen through rita rose-colored glasses country it seen its own citizens . rita faith , enthusiasm , socialism blinds her dreariness east german life , which drives other characters film drink . said , this portrayal raf ( although group not named ) terrorist far too sanitized . liner notes , director refers real raf " so-called " terrorists . film , we shown apparently accidental murder attorney mid-jailbreak , murder policeman who trying catch rita . both these murders rationalized ( those who wish rationalize them ) crazed attempts prevent arrest or continued imprisonment . reality , raf deliberately , malice aforethought , murdered innocent people . susanne albrecht , example , deliberately lured jurgen ponto , chairman dresdner bank albrecht godfather , his death . raf faction killed heinz hillegart , german economic attache sweden , hung his corpse out window . they kidnapped peter lorenz , christian democrat candidate mayor west berlin . raf joined other terrorists hijacking air france jetliner entebbe . they separated jews all other passengers threatened kill them -- would , israeli force led jonathan netanyahu not rescued hostages . short , this bad , bad , bad gang , - if indeed schlondorff portraying raf - it no good sugar-coat them . while film shows stasi helping terrorists -- which indeed happen -- it shows stasi men far too genial my taste . stasi portrayed simply enthusiasts , who romanticize revolutionary spirit terrorists try live vicariously through their exploits . fact , demonstrated elsewhere , relationship stasi various terrorist groups symbiotic : it part east german policy , determined highest level politburo encouragement soviet union , arm train them . despite these flaws , i highly recommend film . it provides very realistic portrayal east germany , right down prefabricated houses workplace collections worldwide revolutionary movements . spy agency " comrade general " shown hunting , which favorite activity stasi commander erich mielke . moreover , bibliana beglau terrific actress , her portrayal rita convincing . we never completely sure why rita joined gang -- it really love , or her obvious sympathies lead her over edge ? finally , film raises some important issues youthful mistakes perspective middle age . overall , film well worth watching .	-1

there not much more added what already written or said russia love . it considered one better bond films series . before i get main point what i add , i want comment widescreen versions issued . i am not sure what proper aspect ratio this film . comparison dvd laser disc , dvd appears cropped top bottom give it wider effect . proportions prints i saw several theaters all resembled laser disc . my more important note curiosity however content film itself . i still not seen any version vhs , laser or dvd ones i seen theater russia love . it appears video two scenes contain cuts . cut # 1 : when red grant bond his knees gunpoint aboard orient express , he editorializes most graphic manner roll film shot bond tatiana boudoir . its time , this rather risqu� piece dialogue . today standards it somewhat timid . bond comeback still intact video , responding grant how it took collection pretty sick minds dream up such scheme . direct response grant cut line gives us insight into bond moral standards there line even he would not cross given his flare more amorous pursuits . cut # 2 : this cut line more obvious comes end film when bond tatiana floating down canals venice . bond holds up reel film seized grant . again , bond makes direct reference grant cut line train droll throwaway remark puzzled looking tatiana . you actually see this cut because music jumps . once more , this cut line dialogue gives us glimpse into james bond mystique it still formed honed screen . i am sure bond probably saying himself , " take all dirty pictures you want . i'm one girl grant , " old boy , " you're one six feet under . " film itself , it one classic james bond films remain so all time . tone series would altered slightly what director terence young established dr . no this film . next film , goldfinger directed guy hamilton , would retain style established terence young yet he would refine character james bond more tongue-in-cheek approach . russia love james bond dedicated civil servant licence kill he uses it assassination krilencu ( fred haggerty ) just coldly objectively he eliminated professor dent ( anthony dawson ) dr . no . these reasons i believe there two distinct camps ranks bond loyalists . one prefers style or more specifically portrayal james bond found russia love , while other faction favors established goldfinger . james bond found russia love much tougher fellow not seen again until her majesty secret service licence kill . specific point russia love score composed john barry . barry score this film not complex or melodically constructed his subsequent bond scores . yet , barry score old school sean connery approach role exactly way it should . barry no-frills score compliments connery no nonsense bond . essence russia love product its time very good one .	1

okay , let brief : if you didn't grow up horror lovin ' 80 or not established fan italian horror films , this movie probably won't work you . this unofficial sequel romero " dawn dead " ( 1978 version course ) made primary italian audiences when dawn released there under title " zombi " . even though this one doesn't take place mall or feature anything or anyone like original storyline dawn , it almost same feel . eventually america , this film came us english dubbed audio under title " zombie " . but now shriek show finally released remastered 2 disc set this classic movie fully uncut first time states . or so i thought . ya see , when movie starts , there brief scene set-up ( it always ) , then it goes into opening credits . i expecting see original italian credits showing it finally under it original title " zombi 2 " , like box . but it isn't , it american version title " zombie " . nitpicking , huh ? but after little searching i found easter egg shows original title sequence finally shows this film called " zombi 2 " . here how get it ( it easy .... ) : disc one go " features " section . there , press number " 6 " your remote . it activate red skull button upper right screen ( you can't activate it searching around menu your arrow buttons , very rare easter egg standards ! ) , it press button automatically take you original italian opening credits clearly show this film called " zombi 2 " , logo all . also , after they're , it show alternate end credits , but honestly i couldn't see any difference them opposed ones movie now . all all , this movie never looked or sounded better ever . some say it looks too cleaned up now . they might point because picture so perfect now ( colors bright , sharp image , brightness exact , sound crisp , etc ) it gives away effects movie . well , i'd rather this movie perfect picture than dark , grainy vhs anyday . this movie classic piece horror history should owned ( especially shriek show 25th anniversary version ... extras here superior .... making documentary long movie itself ! ) anyone two or more " living dead/zombie " dvd already their collection . i'm glad i got it , this way classic horror should re-release d.p.s. : if you look hard enough ( dvd trailer section their previews ) , there " zombi 3 " " zombie 4 " movies out there too . trust me , you don't need them or want them , they don't same feel or quality " zombi 2 " or " dawn dead " . just happy their trailers . enjoy	1

i bought this dvd because it cheap , i figured i could not go wrong old hitchcock classic . first two minutes film gave me some doubts , sound quality opening music poor ( i thought sound fine after picture quality very good ) . then story got going , i amazed . this film really needs appreciated two levels . first , it wonderfully pleasant thriller . it script days when they cared writing good dialogue . it quite witty , pleasantly sexy , latter family-friendly way nonetheless more engaging than so much modern , explicit material . but second level what makes this film so astonishing . it made 1938 england . time , appeasement official policy british government most british press . fact , film censorship board would not even allow words " german " or " nazi " used connection bad guys . film nonetheless manages suggest utter evil nazism show utter bankruptcy appeasement . what most intriguing , film cleverly shows variety people who just don't want get involved any nastiness , one reason or , but who true british hearts gold come through wonderfully once fight proves unavoidable . my pleasure this wonderful film mixed few counts . first , course , sadness film proved so amazingly prophetic tragedy years followed . second this film so little known , when it should rights part history curriculum every student learns high school . third this film just meaningful us today it when it made . alas , it just may we living 1938 all over again .	1

heinrich harrer auto-biography his war time adventures seven years tibet adapted screen france auteur director jean-jacques annaud ( name rose , amant , ' , enemy gates ) sensitivity grand cinematography ( robert fraisse ); this film more meandering journal harrar experiences , rather than your standard structured plot , focusing certain events transformed man lonely , terribly angry individual into aware feeling spirit , mainly due intimate relationship young dali lama . brad pitt portrayed harrer adept skill combining intensity natural cadence , his austrian accent sounded authentic , his blonde hair striking blue eyes expressing anger , loneliness film end , echoes calmness self awareness . heinrich harrer , austrian nazi , olympic gold medallist , used nazi propaganda machine climb near impossible , mt . nanga parbat himalayas , challenge most german climbers time attempted reach her summit but never succeeded . because snow slides , bad weather injuries , harrer team forced turn back , only find england declared war germany ( 1939 ) , taken prisoner english army , living next three years indian pow camp . this enjoyable segment film because harrer unbending spirit stubbornness escape prison . although mean-spirited individual during this time , these scenes depict harrer focused hard nails character . david thewlis peter aufschnaiter ( omen , kingdom heaven ) subtle actor , actor who more than likely not win any lead roles , however his talent skill actor should carry many leading men . peter , his german accent , subtle , his demeanour strong yet sensitive . he played against pitt character touch humility , all great actors , made lead look great . this not say , course , pitt bad any way , it just acting great actor always make you look good . thewlis one such actor . true stars film eight fourteen year old dali lama(s ) , jamyang jamtsho wangchuk sonam wangchuk . both young brothers beamed laughing curiosity temporal wisdom which we come recognize dali lama . my favourite scene jamyang ( fourteen year old ) coming through curtains his new glasses , asking heinrich if he looked like egghead ... very real , very innocen t.t he sadness anger inducing message seven years tibet slaughter millions tibetan buddhist monks destruction over 600 sacred monasteries invading chinese . tragedy politics ignorance dali lama present time made his life mission change , his homeland , tibet , achieve independence communist china . powers world nothing . why ? seven years tibet not fast-paced film , but one look absorb , savour its beautiful photography ponder many messages it communicates . this truly beautiful film .	-1

i am thrilled beyond words filmation blackstar flash gordon both finally released complete series sets dvd ! their time , both shows very well-done terms plot , animation , music , visual effects . ironically , considering most american produced anime recently become low-tech cgi cubist [ ... ] these two vintage entries welcome naturalist relief . considering they both basically early american anime -- pre-robotech / pre-voltron -- i am completely flabbergasted either show even actually made it dvd but i guess we thank he-man , transformers , g.i. joe , thundercats starting retro-wave	1

writer paul monette refers this film one ' trilogy ' bad girl roles elizabeth taylor -- other two " cat hot tin roof " ( 1958 ) " suddenly , last summer " ( 1959 ) . these three films should every dvd collection . certainly they present taylor her absolute physical peak , but they also show dark side her sexuality , which quite riveting . taylor loves refer this movie " trash " , even though she won oscar role . maybe she felt she exploited studio this film content due her highly publicized love affairs time . however , sex sells , beautiful , voluptuous , amoral model , taylor never better . she simply smoulders this film , especially ' morning after ' scenes beginning . she laurence harvey make very hot team , scorching , something we've never seen taylor richard burton . movie really star vechicle , it all taylor her leading man , some excellent supporting players . taylor some good acting , very moving confession scene her last scene harvey she tries escape him . also interesting fact this may first film link child molestation promiscuity , or even talk such subjects . remember this made 1960	-1

i seen bits pieces woody allen " zelig " before but i never seen whole movie until last night . honest , my initial reaction wonder if i would able maintain interest throughout whole movie . it turned out , no problem . " zelig " tells story individual who developed unexplainable ability appear like people his surroundings . it presented documentary format format amazingly well . i'm opinion there plenty actual newsreel footage 1920 ' 30 there also plenty new film made appear it era . i never certain which which because cinematography well . retrospective interviews present day theorists aged contemporaries butressed documentary nature film ( continuous narration ) . title character ( played woody allen ) assumes more more identities , we come understand his efforts like others leaves him no identity his own . i understood allen message expression his frustration negative public reaction his post- " annie hall " movies . he wasn't making kinds pictures everyone else his uniqueness dismissed . i saw him making statement banality lacks meaning satirizing someone who went out his way avoid himself . maybe allen higher purpose making " zelig " but i comfortable message i got out it .	-1
this movie represents all minorities , considering africans most exploited tortured american history . this movie putting racism other foot , where world black world view ran black ppl . john travolta excellent job portraying oppressed man son , who looking break system biasness discrimination . harry belafonte plays obnoxious bigot who doesnt see his ignorance ..................... this movie represents how prejudice american system how politics play strong role determining nots . my opinion majority americans would prosper whatever if given opportunity , so its not just lack self motivation but political dupery played ppl time time again . especially minorities all colors ..................... nuff said !	1

" arabian nights " tells timeless tale scheherazade imaginary stories which she enthralled her husband , sultan schahriar , order save her life , over span " thousand one arabian nights . " this lavish visually stunning production brims fantastic images , fabulous sets costumes , compelling characterizations , interesting stories exotic locations . updated version five classic 2,500 -year-old fantasies popularized 1800s sir richard burton , it features such memorable figures aladdin , ali baba genie lamp . it sure captivate viewers young old . i found it especially enjoyable because it filmed entirely location morocco turkey . vacationed both these countries , i recognized some locations , such leather tanneries fez , morocco , other-worldly rock formations cappadocia near goreme , turkey . sets buildings overflow exquisite detailing common islamic architecture . it treat eye take all rich , delicate decorations each scene realize , many cases , these real places , not simply movie sets . you easily view main feature , running just less than three hours , single sitting . but more likely you'll split it up over several days , 40 convenient chapter stops nicely divide it up into bite-sized segments . special features include fairly typical 13-minute " making " documentary , cast crew biographies production notes . there just few areas i found less than fully satisfying " arabian nights , " but none them detracted my enjoyment story . first , sound volume clarity tended fluctuate , sometimes it hard understand dialogue ( this common problem many dvds ) . second , computer graphics , while quite good overall , not up latest standards set likes " lord rings " " king kong . " instance , " dragons " guarding cave full treasures discovered ali baba not particularly well-rendered , digital " smoke " appears many scenes too obviously cgi . finally , there few deliberate " modernisms " speech or actions , or subtle pop-culture references modern times . first this little jarring , but i soon accepted it spirit which it probably intended . think " xena : warrior princess " you'll understand what i mean . this great dvd whole family enjoy . i heartily recommend " arabian nights " anyone interested spending few pleasant hours magical world sibling rivalry , palace intrigue , genies flying carpets	-1

ok ......... right off bat , we normally love psychological thrillers make you think opposed mindless " 6 kids woods getting slashed " type garbage . however sublime fails many levels .... 1 ) you know what story going 15 minutes into film , so there no element surprise end develops . 2 ) spoiler alert .......................................................................................................... " dream " / " hallucination " ( trying not spoil too bad ) scenes lose all creepiness because they simply silly stupid opposed frightening . 3 ) all characters so odd , you really never care george , his wife , his kids or anybody matter . all all it came across movie trying very " artsy-fartsy " trying create mystery editing together random erratic hallucinatory sequences simply sake confusing opposed intriguing storytelling . we suckered fact one producers tv show " 24 " involved this project . but not help this film all .	-1

this traditional telling life jesus , before his birth resurrection . cinematography breathtaking , color , costuming , writing aided carl sandberg flawless inspired scene jesus weeping then raising lazarus dead awe inspiring . it this scene which motivated me write this review . rather than showing us thunderous awakening dead within tomb , stevens jesus lift hem his toga make difficult climb up rocky bluff , puffing all way tomb top hill . once there , jesus strikes pose made popular style ivan mestrovic french bronze sculptors mid twentieth century . when jesus reaches high tomb , stevens sandberg compose masterpiece prayer god life before jesus calls out , " lazarus ! come forth ! " but striking juxtaposition , stevens pulls back camera , hundreds feet tomb showing jesus , son almighty , mere speck against infinity countryside , let alone universe , much fist fight charlton heston gregory peck big country , shows scale man god work . however , jesus calls-out lazarus instead seeing him rise , we see wonderment , bewilderment , fear love men prospect one man raising abyss . we see crowd , camera dollies , rolls scans , faces believers , unbelievers , doubters ever faithful , their reactions man dead three days , reawakened act god , brought forth human , favored god . how much more effective this direction ? rather than straw man seeing dead rise , we see instead how people like us would react such thing , awe , tears joy , fear , love , attempts reconcile reality , unbelievable . there no better way show spectacle scene alone must-see aspiring artist or film director . my only complaint film nitpicky one , jesus ' ( max von sydow ) hair too short . if you believe , clap your hands , even if you don't , its worth 199 minutes your time . i saw film friends when it came out 1965 own vhs dvd , watched it group , one which self-proclaimed atheist-he tears his eyes lazarus scene . 4.75 star	1
it tough call me first third seasons . i found first season memorable because it many classic gags , i enjoyed relative simplicity stories , they seemed more focus " prehistoric " aspects . i've always loved episode " flintstone flyer " , i even remember building model flyer scratch when i kid . although they've always denied connection honeymooners , least few stories seem like rehashed honeymooners episodes . third season more involved plots , running theme " wilma baby ! nope , not yet ... " lot more parody . would probably more appeal today adults , though i find many stories too bizarre believable . ( i sorta buy idea human-powered helicopter made out wood , it fits cartoon physics ... but third-season " foxy grandma " episode involving old woman bank-robber who throws dynamite sticks just too much . ) second season wasn't strong , many plots seemed like repeats first season it lost much prehistoric charm . while i'll buy complete fourth season just round out collection , those shows typically my least favorite far . they went much too far bizarre stories ; i never liked great gazoo or uber-strong bamm-bamm , there way too much emphasis kids doing totally unbelievable things . what ultimately killed original flintstones series lack consistency writing portrayal characters , few or no running threads throughout show , tendency cartoons back then ( even many ordinary shows ) become increasingly outlandish over time . they seemed lost their original focus cartoon adults , especially last season -- though granted it fairly novel idea " real " human characters doing human things cartoon , so i'll cut them some slack . quality dvds this set much same others , although i notice two or three episodes noticeable ( but not horrible ) video noise , couple episodes lower-than-normal audio levels ( just crank up volume bit those ) . probably just means they couldn't find original sources some them resort other means ... i haven't checked out extras , though this set they used both sides last disc hold episodes instead using flip side extras . here my take : if you're not familiar flintstones then start first season , it most firmly grounded four seasons . if you really like it , check out some others . third-season episodes some best , but there few stinkers	1

i'm very surprised negative reviews . while this dvd clearly not made walt disney studios , it what it supposed - introduce french words phrases children easy-to-follow way . actors speak authentic french . what taught quite useful - introductions , counting , colors , playing , food , etc . actors use these words phrases within simple storyline they again repeated during review section . they also repeated once more songs scattered throughout dvd ( songs pretty catchy way - more so than other children videos ) . so , if you looking pure entertainment , this video probably not you but if you want tool hold your child attention teach them french , then you should give this try .	1

i love disaster movies , or any disaster movie involves water - titanic , hard rain , titanic , pearl harbour , titanic ... yeah i love titanic . but i shocked when watching this film how much titanic resembles it ! there lot where you see where james cameron might got some his ideas . i felt very claustrophobic watching this film , not only we watching it darkness , but there also fireworks going off outside , film itself very claustrophobic . there no natural light , boat capsized . i awful time recognising actors this , particularly gene hackman . i knew name , i could not pick out which one he . ( very blonde moment there . ) i eventually recognised him , cos he main character ( big clue there ) , he also using simon cowell fashion sense - high waisted trousers , polo neck tucked . i don't know why it took me so long recognise him , but i managed recognise ernest borgnine , who played rogo , little house prairie , one or two episodes . poseidon adventure really good film , no need special effects or cgi , apart odd one or two . nearly all stunts performed actors themselves , when possible , they would ended up many bumps . what made this film all more better lack special effects , it made it all more real . i holding my breath during many scenes - which quite difficult considering i blocked up cold time - because it so claustrophobic , it made it all more worse . poseidon adventure definitely up there one my favourite disaster movies now , i really look forward seeing sequel , ' remake ' . i just discovered looking imdb , red buttons ( what strange name ) also little house prairie , two episodes	-1

these two movies disney classics , especially first one , " escape witch mountain " - i saw this movie back when i kid it one my favorite movies ( still ) . it follows story two orphans named tia tony who extraordinary powers . not knowing where they came , they set out following map only belonging they ever owned- tia starcase . way there several men after them , one which ruthless man out use them their powers his twisted advantage . second movie , " return witch mountain " weaker than first , but still worth watch . tia tony much older this one , but much more comfortable their own skin because they know who they where they came . tony kidnapped brainwashed/controlled ruthless scientist who commands him use his power while tia gets help local street gang full delinquents save him . movies loosely based novel alexander key which also titled " escape witch mountain . " i recently found out he also wrote " return witch mountain " but i haven't chance read it ye t.t he first novel worth read but very different movies . example , tia mute not speak . she communicates tony telepathically . they also older book than they movie . orphanage they go beginning movie more so juvenile delinquents book filled bullies pretty mean caretaker . if you liked these movies , i recommend checking ebay books!i'd give " escape witch mountain " 5 stars " return witch mountain " 4 . they both classics	1
out three john waters films i've seen ( pink flamingos , serial mom , this film ... order ) , this definitely my favorite . it probably waters most normal film ( even this film some weird moments ); it got great cast , dialogue funny , some events play like some weird farce real life . edward furlong ( terminator 2 ) plays pecker , young kid who snaps pictures everything around him . graffiti'd walls , fat women , girls bus , man getting his hat stolen , pubic hair ... you name it , he takes picture it . eventually pecker photos get noticed rorey ( lili taylor , ' i shot andy warhol ' ) who puts his photos gallery mass acclaim . eventually , it takes toll pecker life everything spirals out control ... typical john waters fashion . movie plot pretty simple , but it hilarious . example ; pecker sister crissy sugar crazed brat . child protective services worker shows up house prescribes rittalin , which instantly changes her behavior . way i'm explaining it doesn't sound very funny all , but if you've any experience adhd ... then you'll get laugh out . christina ricci co-stars shelley , pecker girlfriend who runs fascist laundromat . i've always liked ricci actress , but her looks kind come go films . she'll look great one film then like crap . movie " ice storm " which came out around same time this , she didn't look great . here , she looks awesome . really hot she adds some fresh bits sarcasm film well . am i only one who thinks waters could've splurged nude scene here . anyway , all waters films , this movie not enjoyed everybody . however , this film different style then other two films i've mentioned ... so even if you no idea who waters , this movie isn't something you run tell your friends ( pink flamingos anybody ? ) . it damn funny , entertaining , witty . grade : a-	1

i first saw this movie high school french class back 70s . can't say i remembered much it except famous song image ( though not contents ) final gas station scene . course , our french teacher probably didn't let us see subtitles , so i'm guessing i really didn't understand most it anyway . got it lark recently watch again found it very touching , beautifully filmed , if tad melodramatic . coincidence , i watched " young girls rochefort " while back , made same director also starring deneuve . actually , i think i preferred " rochefort , " but both worth watching . simple story told straight-forward way , fact masked all dialogue sung . ending not what you expect , really , both characters appearing colder harder than typical romance might them . still , movie better because this , more moving realistic . each scene lovingly gorgeously put together , so its feast eyes . ears --- not so much . i found women voices harsh times , hitting high piercing notes grated . still , score pleasant -- though it may overused bi t--t he famous song joy hear	-1

i say all ggw videos i own ( 45-50 ) , this most disappointing since snoop dogg garbage couple years ago . only reason i give it two stars girls this one some prettiest so far . downsides numerous ; " hosts " take up far too much space this disk . let face it , we don't buy these dvds because we want hear unfunny guys interviewing drunk college kids . example : " hey , you fun spring break ? " well , she ninteen , drunk , beach mexico without parental supervision . i don't think it possible she couldn't good time . i don't need some guy asking banal questions airhead her boyfriend five minutes , when all i really bought dvd see her boobies ! ( btw-we never get see them ) . my second complaint whole dvd seems edited cable . title " spring break 2005 uncensored , " but this absolutely not true . i said before , girls this video stunningly beautiful . hats off crew rounding up truly fine selection gorgeous , uninhibited talent . but scenes shot hotel rooms ( 3x girl-girl , one solo bathtub ) , camera cuts away fades out just before you see any real action . if you've ever seen playboy soft-core stuff , you know exactly what i'm talking . i only hope unedited material finds it way video eventually , but i feeling it won't . here why : my third complaint whole dvd seems one long info-mercial [ ... ] . several times during video , ggw web address pops up screen , usually after disappointingly edited segments mentioned above . apparently , if you want see whole scene , you become member ggw website . plus , last ten minutes dvd just late-night commercials ( censored , boot ) they show tv . after all money they scammed me when i ordered dvds directly , i won't even buy their products new anymore . all-in-all , i'm extremely disappointed this dvd . if spring break 2005 uncensored dvd format ggw plans follow future , i'll never buy their products again	-1

there no reason why alan partridge couldn't popular us " office " ... however , bbcamerica insists burying show late-night , so it remains cult favorite . this dvd talk show " knowing me , knowing you " which isn't quite good later sitcom " i'm alan partridge " but it still brilliant . partridge ( played steve coogan ) great character , completely obnoxious , but you can't help but cheer him he annoys his guests until they beat him up . this set 6 episodes show , christmas special , lots extras , like commentary extended episodes . if you like modern british comedy like office/little britain/etc , you should pick this up ( even if you haven't seen it due bbcamerica bad scheduling ) . it worth paying 20 bucks see something decent tv	1

everyone gone insane ? english teacher who taught this novel couple years , i looking little something more faithful novel than original version . hah ! this piece trash worst version classic novel i've seen 20 years teaching . there approximately three moments movie actually text , i'm sure purely accidental . monster gangster , frankenstein looks like one spartans 300 , elizabeth deranged emo , clerval relegated role idiotic womanizer . when credits rolled end i saw branagh directed this film ( he who created most watchable , beautiful , textually accurate version hamlet ever ) , i thought i may well burn myself funeral pyre ( one few textually accurate details this horror film ) . here deal - don't waste your time . read book . byron shelley right - mary somehting going this story - too bad branagh forgot read it	-1
" happiness " movie basically irony everything movie ironic ... including title . no one this movie happy , not even characters who think they . once movie over , you probably won't overwhelmed happiness either . this not happy movie ... although it pretty funny , sick demented way . but i think review cover sums up film nicely ; " deeply disturbing shockingly funny . " this movie some most disturbing sometimes disgusting scenes i've seen movie long time . movie centers around three sisters ; joy ( jane adams ) , helen ( lara flynn boyle ) , trish ( cynthia stevenson ) jordan . although almost all characters film kind circle back these three sisters , they're not really main characters . movie opens joy dinner date man named andy ( jon lovitz ) . andy looks distraught joy tells him it not going work out . what i think one funniest awkward scenes movie i've seen recently , adam gives her limited edition goldplated ashtray then takes it away tells her he saving it girl who truly loves him . credit sequence promptly follows . then we suddenly meet man named allen ( oscar winner philip seymour hoffman ) who explains his therapist bill maplewood ( dylan baker , ' head state ' ) he sexual fantasties his next door neighbor , who just happens helen . bill also happens married trish . ironic . allen begins series calls helen , telling her graphic detail what he thinks her before more irony begins pouring . meanwhile , we learn it seems trish only happy one this trio sisters ... she seems perfect life ; three kids good husband . but bill hiding something well , perverted fascination little boys . really disturbing scenes become this fascination . there also subplot sister parents ( louise lasser ben gazzarra ) who splitting up ; camryn manheim ( former abc tv show ' apprentice ' ) who plays neighbor allen who also hiding secret . now , i expected love " happiness " some reason ; even though i knew hardly anything plot . but , i didn't love ... i liked it , but i didn't love it . it very unique movie it definitely funny ; but i thought most interesting aspect movie one you see least . allen , played so well hoffman , could've subject his own film . don't get me wrong , i don't think they should've gotten rid rest story but i think they should payed more attention this character . besides story , there other good things it . dialogue very smart there some classic lines this movie . conversations bill his son very creepy though . case , this hasn't made clear . this movie not everybody ; many people may find it sick immoral , especially since it seems nothing really bad happens bill despite his wrongdoings . but filmbuffs appreciate it , but mature audiences must . grade : b+	-1

recently i saw reservoir dogs first time since ' 90 , struck how perfect , just dead-on flawless , quentin tarantino writing this edge-of-your nerves movie . it says something somehow reservoir dogs seemed far less violent me today than i remembered high school , i think signifies lot how far violence pervaded media well entertainment industry ( which increasingly one same , aren't they ? ) . those who don't know , this possessingly intricate story , told flashback/flash forward/non-linear style tells gang would-be jewelry store robbers hired crime boss his son commit fast ( " out two minutes no matter what " ) heist downtown los angeles one lackluster morning . unknown each other , these specialists various corners nation assigned names like " mr. blond " " mr. white " " mr. blue " " mr. pink " " mr. orange " etc . given precise instructions never give out any real information themselves they go securing cache diamonds recently imported israel . classic tarantino fashion all goes wrong it possibly , police intervene , blood spurts , gunfire cracks like thunder innocent lives horribly lost , what began amid laid-back breakfast laced rapid-fire profanity cerebral analysis madonna's`80 anthem " like virgin " suddenly shifts second act warehouse which remnants crew assemble , each paranoically aware one among them police informer . but who it ? even audience doesn't know till after it sat dismay through one more gruesome torture sequences ever caught celluloid . first couple times you see this great classic , you'll dazed , but sooner or later it'll hit you , it me , screenplay reservoir dogs might some best writing ever hollywood . owning it dvd best way take all easy miss twists turns not only plot but adrenaline-propelled dialogue . five stars	1

following arthur penn 1967 hit `bonnie clyde , ' hollywood enjoyed brief fling depression-era gangsters . free-wheeling woodstock generation found something like anti-establishment , anti-authoritarian , legendary outlaws their parents ' youth . legendary bank robber john dillinger certainly fit bill . john milius dillinger we meet title character , played warren oates , height his career . john dillinger notorious character enough wit recognize he doing rubes favor , sorts , every time he holds up bank . it gives those robbed something talk remember . anyway , dillinger seemingly relies efficient professionalism over firepower . least he don't shoot lessen he shot , which sight better than gun happy thug baby face nelson ( richard dreyfuss , ) who joins gang mid-movie . , such things measured back then , probably better than what we get dillinger hunting alpha g-man melvin purvis ( ben johnson ) . we get awful lot purvis this movie - he supplies periodic voice over narration gets equal screen time oates . milius would write teleplay 1974 `melvin purvis , g-man , ' which starred gruff voiced character action , dale robertson . parallel story telling works well enough , although dillinger gets lost time or two . we get tag purvis few times when he big showdown public enemies , they're very well handled . depression , which figured prominently social setting explanation do-badders , set deep background isn't much factor . dillinger , he tells his girlfriend/common law wife billie frechette ( michelle phillips , her debut , ) just always wanted bank robber , . towards end story fall apart bit . dillinger disappears completely last act , which dominated purvis negotiations lady red ( cloris leachman anna sage , madam who arranged dillinger capture outside movie house chicago . ) besides john dillinger , milius either scripted , directed , or both movies geronimo , teddy roosevelt , jeremiah johnson judge roy bean . legendary americans all , milius very much `print legend ' director . sometimes you get feeling if it doesn't lend itself photo op milius isn't much interested it . it makes good action flicks , shaky history lessons , frustration those who like character development . johnson ( good actor ) oates ( very good actor ) make their characters more compelling than written . after big shootout ( excitingly recreated movie ) his flight chicago dillinger life kind fell apart . he'd separated billie underwent plastic surgery . perhaps because he thought plastic surgery might confuse audience - perhaps - milius decided ignore dillinger chicago , save purvis plot capture him . heck , i would happy whole movie , starring oates , course , dillinger chicago . probably best suited gangster movie fans , or fans ben johnson warren oates .	-1

my experience , seeing words " national lampoon " any film title bad omen , indicating tastelessness dearth actual comedy up ahead . national lampoon gold diggers manages take series all-time low - which , sadly , no mean feat . friedle chris owen act if they auditioning future installment dumb dumber , plot suffers definite " ick " factor - , sadly , those actually movie strengths . calvin ( friedle ) leonard ( owen ) grew up together orphanage now trying make their mark world young adults . they certainly don't want work living , so they take up life petty crime . they pitiful failures this wind up jail . then , two old ladies they accosted street bail them out invite them visit their impressive home . guys ( which i mean calvin , he only one really capable actual human thought ) think their hosts rich , so it they devise plan marry them , wait their imminent deaths , then live large their inheritances . doris ( louise lasser ) betty mundt ( renee taylor ) may heirs mundt prophylactics fortune , but they fact cash poor ( thanks their insane uncle , who charge mundt estate ) . they make their own plans marry two young men , purchase sizable insurance policies them , then kill them . double wedding takes place , marriages consummated ( i hear yuck !? ) , month passes . calvin finds married life buxom , not-dead-yet doris driving him insane , so he leonard begin setting " accidental " traps their wives ; naturally , women finalizing their own murder plans same time . mr. mrs. smith , this ain't - but goes without saying . i won't lie say i didn't laugh or smile time or two because i , but national lampoon gold diggers aims low - really low - cannot begin escape black hole stupidity upon which it built . i think i speak vast majority human beings when i say we just don't want see senior citizen women prancing around onscreen like victoria secret models . there crude then there national lampoon crude , gold diggers crude it gets . this film should all rights career killer anyone involved it - although nikki ziering may emerge relatively unscathed given fact her screen time severely limited	-1

ivan reitman 1984 mega-hit , it lesser sequel , both included this double feature dvd gift set long time fans ghostbusters should consider absolute must own . chances you already know story : three bumbling scientists ( bill murray , dan aykroyd , harold ramis ) lose their campus jobs go into business themselves . only thing , their business involves capturing containing gross slimy ghosts throughout new york . also featuring sigourney weaver , ernie hudson , rick moranis ; ghostbusters ended up super hit which spawned animated series , tons toys , sequel five years later . ghostbusters 2 , while nowhere near wonderful first film but still pretty fun , finds guys back business new breed evil birthed time new years . although this isn't first time both films appeared dvd , there enough special features here make this gift set worth picking up . there nice selection deleted scenes ( nothing substancial ) , couple featurettes , commentary reitman co ., but there no features devoted ghostbusters 2 . instead , there two animated episodes linked two films , there exclusive scrap book included too nice variety information fans . if you've already double dipped ghostbusters dvd , picking this up entirely up you . however , if you're fan these films don't own them dvd , pick this affordable gift set up enjoy	1

this movie might perfect example how audiences react more " famous " names more " superficial " " commercial " movies ... this movie unfortunate come out nearly same time more popular " dangerous liasons " featuring more stars ... i've seen movie many times television , i admit it good entertainment , but it never really made me crazy . , personally , stars doesn't mean great actors , most cases ... not long ago valmont shown television , both read book seen two movie versions it ( " dangerous liaisons " old french version jeanne moreau ) i very curious see what this one would offer ... me , i've never seen better valmont or better marquise ... whole cast great . that what i call good acting directing ... i haven't seen all colin firth movies , but i definetely say it must one his best performances ever ... watching him act valmont simple delicious ! comparing not always good thing , but this movie more luxurious more " serious " than " dangerous liaisons " great acting adds great result ; much classier version . if one seduced some aging not-so-attractive malkovich close , well , each his own taste ... i don't consider pfeiffer thurman great actresses . i'm sure i won't able convince everyone valmont much more subtle full-of-finesse performances , even though it not perfect copy book , it closest spirit meaning . worth your time !	1
" daughters dust " truly cinematic feast eyes , one savored slowly , metaphorically taking sips it if it bottle some elegant vintage wine . those expecting fast-paced narrative drama most surely disappointed , since film slowly takes us through final days gullah family life sea islands north carolina georgia , shortly before most family treks north new , promised life bereft time-honored gullah traditions . filmmaker - screenwriter - julie dash rendered beguiling look peazant family past present , seen through eyes matriarch nana peazant ( cora lee day extremely rich , intense performance , that truly one best ensemble cast fine performances . ) . there ample attention paid african folk wisdom culture , demonstrating rich cultural heritage sea islands ' gullah people , peazant family ponders its future one final family gathering . cinematographer arthur jafa camera recorded this saga visually sumptuous imagery sincerely respectful gullah traditions affectionately pays homage them . dash wonderful film must surely rank one most intriguing cinematic debuts american cinema , hopefully pointing way new generation afro-american filmmakers others interested her unique , almost existentalist , means cinematic storytelling ( i might add too i pleasure hearing ms. dash discuss her film here new york city few days ago ; it delightful , inspiring discussion which both emotionally intellectually quite rewarding . i might add too , i pleasure speaking her afterwards , discovering we mutual admirers splendid fiction octavia butler , whose unexpected passing last year deprived both afro-american literature literary science fiction one their most thoughtful , eloquent voices . )	1

i bought this movie dvd now i wish i didn't . first all where action adventure ? movie more arnold searching terrorist who killed his wife child than him getting revenge people who it . i expected see arnold shooting it up kicking butt . instead i got borring dragged out scene him going south america , getting lost , kidnaped then ecscapeing before he finally get back united states tracks down people who it . only action you get last 30 seconds movie , when arnold kills terrorist . why would you pay 19.95 $ see 30 seconds action ?? forget it ! save your money stay away this borring put me sleep movie !	-1
i don't know how ride motorcycle ( i'm car guy ) . i've never watched motogp tv . i can't tell honda yamaha if placed front me . yet , i simply totally captivated this dvd . i admit i enjoy ewan mcgregor movies , i especially enjoyed ' long way round ' . this guy who seemed know what he doing , so it basis this ( my rather bored one day ) i bought this dvd . i didn't know what expect . but i tell you now : it better than anything i could imagined . basically , this documentary following people events during two seasons motogp . cast characters colorful . there rock-star-like veteran , meteoric challenger , likeable everyman plagued bad luck , young rookie , mad doctor looking after whole flock . documentary takes sympathetic look these guys , charting their ups downs over 2 tumultuous seasons furious racing pain-staking preparations . battles them track riveting dramatic . full dirty tricks , bitter mindgames , hot-blooded racing multiple overtaking maneuvers . think all racing movies you've ever watched ( le mans , days thunder , driven etc etc ) - this beats them all wide margin terms drama tension ... it all real life ! after this , you'll probably never thrilled f1 , indy , nascar or any race 4 wheels ever again - where you'll lucky get one breath-taking overtaking move per race , not several per lap motogp . this documentary really remarkable access all big stars sport . heroes , prima-donnas , hotshot rookies all open themselves camera . they all turn out charismatic , genuine ' human ' individuals . any movie screenplay would struggle depict characters instantly sympathetic this bunch bikers . you simply cannot imagine schumacher , alonso co formula 1 doing dvd like this - where you viewer get up close ride them . magic . only thing comparable my experience would ' metallica : some kind monster ' documentary - terms close , personal access mega-stars film-makers . race footage brilliant , matched decent soundtrack . watching races ( albeit highlights only ) enough get pulse rate up . film-makers good job keeping pace film running just right . thrash-speed races intercut well more introspective looks invidual riders . nice job . dvd offers good extras . ability follow key laps key races any one key riders interesting touch . it allows viewer see exactly how race won or lost perspective each protagonist . but best extra all ' sequel ' documentary , following riders next two seasons . after exhilirating film like this , you don't want it just end like - you keep wanting know what happens next . me , that mark successful film . well , you see i liked this film . watching it not spurred me get motorbike licence ( i still prefer my turbo 4wd car ) , but it excited me enough i'll tuning motogp this season . you don't bike fan enjoy this dvd ( i wasn't ) . i would recommend it anyone who : - enjoys real-life drama ( actually melodrama ! ) - enjoys good documentary film-making - or simply bit ' speed ' their bloo	1

population hong kong approximately 7 million people . i'd say half them get shot this movie . usually when movie runs over 2 hours , it because there lot plot director wanted squeeze . case hard boiled , running time 126 minutes clearly necessitated john woo desire get into guinness book records " most people killed gunfire single motion picture . " chow yun-fat charismatic actor who bring wonderful balletic grace gunplay , this movie gives him plenty opportunity show his stuff . he shoots ( usually pistol each hand ) while diving headlong over furniture , while swinging rope , while sliding down banister (!) , while hurled through air explosions . sometimes he even shoots while standing still . he shoots , shoots , shoots . bad guys shoot , shoot , shoot . yun-fat fellow cops shoot , shoot , -- you get idea . there some fine action scenes this film , but my eyes glazing over long before it ended . there wasn't enough distinguish one scene bunch people machine-gunned next , it became painfully repetitious . personally i would highly recommend replacement killers over hard boiled . there plenty yun-fat balletic shoot-em-up action , but not so much you find yourself odd position lulled sleep gunfire	-1

i saw this movie i found it both shocking choking . it displays children young 4 years old smoking cigarettes ! filmmakers take into account damage tobacco could these child stars ? ( yes , cigarettes smoke real , not cg . ) i think they should omitted such scenes script , because it displays behavior that not only illegal several countries , but also threatening both society childhood . no matter what other reviewers thought movie , i give it disgusting 1 , this last movie i ever watch depicts smoking children . those haven't yet watched this movie , please don't watch it , unless you want cancer win health wars . here i hand out lesson every active or aspiring moviemaker : if you want depict smoking children , use computer graphics instead real thing	-1

fan zombie movies someone who enjoyed city living dead zombie , i very disappointed house cemetery . fulci manages create good mystery first two-thirds movie , only squander it some poorly executed scare scenes . house cemetery researcher ( whose work never specified ) who moves his wife his kid into house massachussets order finish out work colleague who killed himself his mistress . titular house only place they really find moment , so dr. boyle , his wife lucy their son bob move despite lot bad signs , like boarded-up door cellar tombstone dr. jacob tess freudstein front hall . bob little red-headed girl friend who keeps warning him how bad house ( though no one else sees her ) . furthermore , people keep claiming dr. boyle town before non-existent daughter ( which he denies , not totally convincingly ) . he also seems some secret relationship babysitter , anne , who starts unboarding cellar door middle night . lucy seems either recovering or suffering serious psychological issues . got ? good , because half stuff never gets explained . only things get worked out little red-headed girl identity identity killer ( neither which hard figure out ) . there some nice visual moments earlier parts film ( fact killer one normal hand one rotting hand , photograph changes each viewing , mannequin gets beheaded starts bleeding ) but fulci ability handle gore moments disappoints . he lingers too long over some deaths , makes killer so ridiculously slow snail could outrun him bits like babysitter head falling down stairs come off funny rather than scary . compared injury eye scene zombie or christopher george chopping through coffin cotld , dr. boyle chopping through door around his son head feels like self-parody . fulci other films incoherent plots , but rarely way seems work against plot ( dream-like nature city living dead seems appropriate given prophetic dream heroine gets mystical nature threat ) execution setpieces usually fantastic . house cemetery neither thing working its favor . it not hell living dead-level bad , but fact it some genuinely good acting ( especially paolo malco , who plays dr. boyle ) interesting set-up almost make flaws worse . also , this version " never before seen deleted scene " , but it no sound just extended reaction shot after bat attack	-1

" above rim " entertaining street drama focuses around kyle lee watson , inner-city high school basketball player who shows lot promise but lets his own arrogance get best him . he won't listen anybody who offers him advice how improve his game , he thinks he best player ever . he hoping his mad skills catching college scout attention , but he catch birdie eyes when he plays . birdie well known gang leader who offers kyle good life so long he plays his neighborhood team " shoot-out " basketball contest means world him . kyle -- impatient ever -- agrees join , not seeing clear danger front him . high school security guard past knows danger birdie presents , he only who chance get through kyle before it too late . not only this very good basketball movie , but it also intense character-driven drama centered around choices we make life ... how we live them long run . film some great performances duane martin , marlon wayans late tupac shakur . even though everybody great their roles , showstopper indeed shakur . he gives very masterful performance really sticks out stay you long after movie over . my only complaint length movie . it true movie runs little over hour half isn't short , but i think story characters open more possibilities add movie . i think more opportunities risks could taken further enrich story . still , it really good movie didn't disappoint me . dvd doesn't whole lot offer . you either watch movie widescreen or fullscreen , depending your preference . movie looks sounds very good . only special features offered movie trailers , those aren't even great . i would've loved it if they included music video , " regulate " warren nate dogg . fact , given some great rap songs this movie , they could've included couple music videos . it not great dvd , but least it not expensive . i really enjoyed " above rim . " it may not flawless , but it definitely more right than wrong . characters what really dominate movie . even if you're not fan game , it still something check out if you're fan character drama . exciting , intense , conflict-driven full heart , " above rim " very well film . -michael cran	1
i remember watching this high school . i thought it great fun then my kids think it still now . okay , we're not talking academy award material here ( emmy ? ) . ralph , bill , pam back third final season this far too short series man who given suit aliens gives him super powers . he teamed fbi agent help world survive itself . first few minutes ralph looses instruction book must noodle out how operate suit . he runs into few walls , literally . first season little rough . second season fleshed out concept . this third season started stretch its legs but show cancelled . i looked years novels based show , no avail . i even contacted cannell ask if i could write them . disney half-heartedly working feature film based show cannell wouldn't cut loose permission . alas , it would've fun . anyway , if you other two seasons you'll love this one . only complaint/change i would make play theme song before each episode . i would've made it so you could hit " forward next " button go right action . also , jacket plays bit theme song . i wish they'd made it possible change batteries . mike hudspeth st. louis , missour	1

scratching deeper beyond surface one find return seven significantly different its predecessor , magnificent seven . it much more than thematically framed sequel which it easily mistaken . return seven dark film it not offer hope truly optimistic future any its characters . this respect it complete inversion magnificent seven . through their catharsis original we saw attempt redemption through act nobility part seven . they truly noble i believe redeemed their transgressions gunmen . some thought they could start their lives over again but inevitably they could not . film end it seven ultimately all committed their singular code ethics morality emotionally charged finale . this film there very little emotion surface . instead director burt kennedy gives us thought provoking study into human psyche very nature defeatism human spirit . this film there no pretensions part seven . most them this just gun job . there no higher aspirations they cognizant . if it not this job , it would next . tell his story burt kennedy focuses almost entirely character chris leader , perfectly portrayed again yul brynner . this not really tale seven . instead kennedy uses brynner all his aplomb apparent stoicism curiously examine probe motivations other six , lorca villain ( pompously played mexican director emilio fernandez ) several other key characters . effect kennedy takes what apparently happy or satisfactory ending magnificent seven asks what if . what if 10 years later remaining characters not so contented prior events led us believe they would ? would friends willing go up against innumerable odds ? would strangers once again sign go up against those same innumerable odds ? strong still help weak ? who really strong weak ? when 50 or more marauding vaqueros whisk away chico ( julian mateos ) other mexican farmers surrounding villages chris vin ( robert fuller ) agree come his aid . however it chris alone recruits members " seven " this time out . kennedy singularly endows chris sense morality level headedness this film comes his wisdom manner nobility . effect this brynner film all way . just john sturges ' directorial style so smooth his own storytelling glossed right over depth complexity his own work so burt kennedy . however , kennedy challenged very dark brooding tale tell . where sturges ' magnificent seven could easily taken purely action film level still successful , kennedy not luxury . kennedy deliver action film built previous events he also approach story different perspective remain fresh yet keep it thematically concept original " seven . " not easy task ! if viewer not look deeply into this film it may just appear well produced `dud . ' however , i believe kennedy succeeds far beyond expectations more times i view this film . again it comes back brynner . he makes members seven ( vin , chico colbee ) all come realizations themselves his subtle yet profound dialogue . he gives riker luis chance redemption even though both men come total opposites spectrum . he helps failed priest rise his failures " least far his knees . " chris even gives lorca , villain chance ride out because when chris younger he gave him same chance . however , chris refuses let lorca now bathe his personal grief ineffectual father " other men blood . " yet even lorca literally redeemed end film . when petra tells chris farmers never forget them he simply replies , " that all man ask . " mystique legacy " seven . " even character chris endowed human flaws . he recklessly took young manuel rounding out seven " luck " tragic results we see brynner deeply grieved screen . this film hard lessons learned . technically this well-made film . cinematography full crane , dolly tracking shots , which gives it both perspective movement . bernstein score full lush this single cohesive element keeps seven together . set designs dark , grim rustic giving film pensive psychological depth . payoff brynner viewer comes final shot . looking farmers rebuilding village he comments , " i'll damned . " vin looks him responds , " i doubt . i doubt very much . " they both ride off . they just don't make heroes like any more	1

i heard this film " really funny " " worth watching " . i'm not big adam sandler fan but i am fan kate beckinsale christopher walken . i sorely disappointed this film . audience can't relate main character first because he just down right irritating . i hoping gags would get funnier but they didn't . i also found most film rather depressing we watch main characters life slowly destroyed around him . overall click ok , kate beckinsale looked beautiful usual but even not enough save it . i would not recommend buying this film .	-1

a-team-the complete third season now available dvd . dual sided dvd box set includes all 25 episodes shows 1984-1985 season . a-team very popular series during 80 . co-star mr. owes much his 1980 success a-team . mr. , b.a. , didn't really much screen time hannibal ( george peppard ) or characters face murdock , but he easily most recognizable member cast . season 3 , similar previous seasons filled with-action , adventure , exotic locals , disguises , interesting situations . season begins episode " bullets bikinis " ( airdate 9/18/84 ) . when mob attempts take over hotel a-team rescue her hotel . strange twist , two part episode " bend river " falls into slot second third episodes season . usually when series two part episode early season episode used season premiere . well , " bend river " actually slow episode which may explain why it not used season premiere . this episode archeologist traveling amazon region looking secrets but he finds conflict local pirates bad guy named el cahon . soon hannibal seen movie set dressed up monster costume aquamaniac . after he fired , face tries convince producer keep him . no film work keeping them occupied , they decide help tanya ( archeologists girlfriend ) find her missing archeologist boyfriend . season three , a-team begun lose little it magic fan base . compared miami vice , a-team seemed little quirky corny times . despite this , it still great show fans show should add season three their collection because there some good episodes during season . season three special guests include markie post ( nightcourt ) , dennis franz ( nypd blue ) , kristen meadows .	1
i heard lot hoopla dan brown fictional novel . most it trash ; people claim brown opened pandora box christianity , when , reality , he nothing more than sway fickle , while reinforcing beliefs those who thorough research . interestingly , history channel documentary brown fictional novel quite enlightening . read material those involved jesus seminar , i feel they nothing more than bunch left-wing quacks . yet , people took part , gained fame , jesus seminar quite genius . here group people successfully made millions dollars because speculation . fact , sir arthur conan doyle agatha christie , together , could not written better speculative fiction . course , documentary shines lot light this otherwise dark bit pseudo-history . first , documentary discusses various " possibilities " historical jesus . they take several books brown cited list , which located back his book , explore possibility their true . each book brown cited , sticks , nothing more than fickle assumptions based upon skewed views beliefs . while i am not against speculation , because hypotheses push research discovery , i am against presenting something truth when there no real evidence . even one authors holy blood , holy grail makes appearance history channel doc . what he say his own novel ? he basically says his books not prove anything ; all he attempting convey possibility there could jesus royal blood line . sum up documentary : history channel excellent job exposing pure speculation dan brown , all others involved accusing christians not seeing " true " historical jesus . while there some questions historians still need answer , anything ancient , jesus still stands test time , firmly . i surprised history channel position repute claims dan brown , jesus seminar , but they , very well , too . take time sit watch this great documentary if you unsure , skeptical , or scared what dan brown novel say christianity . you not let down .	1

this excellent film . billy bob clean-vut barber who keeps himself . his wife married him because she liked he didn't talk very much . it tragedy epic proportions , great performances all involved . only thing me holds this back five star film fact every single scene someone lights up cigarette or taking deep drags one . alone justifies this film " " rating . when watching this film , it seems they encouraging people " cool " smoking pleasurable thing . most notorious moment me when frances mcdormand sitting bathtub asks her barber husband ( billy bob ) shave her legs . he walks somberly cigarette drooping his lips she tells him give her drag . this putrid moment just drove me crazy ! but then , just my opinion . overall , film could good greater if it not incessant smoking throughout . plot slow yet intensely emotional . if you don't mind smoking , then you probably enjoy this dramatic tragedy . if you strongly opposed smoking or children who interested seeing this , you should review film before letting them see it	1
i previously bought 1st version . liked it very much . so i eagerly looking forward this latest version . happy know this version more new science related information - which what i interested . those who want just listen interviews scientist , there seperate section entirely interviews . best part they re-interviewed scientist they explain more what they previuosly said give more new informations . those who not seen 1st version , i think it alright watch this . viewers highly adviced keep their mind open all information said this movie . interpretation acceptance facts up viewer . everyday more more things discovered our world , universe what they made . if you deep question reality , you might find answer this movie . -- ravi , singapor	1

this horrendous movie . i never claim it movie my generation . it one many reasons why i absolutely hate " 80 " . others : breakdancing , yuppie lifestyle , power hungry businessmen/women , women manly handshakes , new wave music , junk movies like this . i know main character nothing less than manipulator who only concerned himself , what he get out life . he ridicules his friend because he sick , doesn't feel like driving ferris around ... especially ferrari mysteriously gets lost parking garage , so what am i left believe i wonder if this where ice cube got inspiration " it good day " . i don't care what decade it , or what cool back then , or now manipulating your friends " not " i repeat " not " cool . i know john johnette . public this something sexual relase . i could picture private parts men women everywhere getting soaking wet this movie , i find it so repulsive everyone out there finds this funny .	-1
i similar situation this show [ catholic envirement ] seen both this show ' men boys town ' . this reason i got these show [ both one dvd ] . it good deal money . one funniest parts when mo made whitey look like al jolson how everyone laughed him during row call . gene reynolds played tony ponessa [ also starred ' they shall music ' ] perfect part . unlike ted martley [ men boys town ] who cried attention tony preferred thing himself not depend others anything . some ways he ted martley alike . these shows sure takes me back those days when i raised catholic orphanage where i saw both these shows .	1
buy this movie . read book . movie very beautiful i personally love watch it regular basis , but script takes huge liberties history . although this really masterful film making many respects , actual story book more interesting , more complex , we get find out what happened these actual people after their seabiscuit collaberation ended . whole tale one worth knowing . unlike jeff bridges character , seabiscuits ' owner acomplished horseman who attended military school served cavalry . didn't see movie ... most movies based history leave out awful lot . none us sit through six hour show . so just remember you never get accuracy hollywood , you get great show . there difference . gone wind same injustice it ; movie romantic pastiche while book astonishingly different . might wanna read one too . if you ever rode or spent any time track you'll need fix this movie periodicly just see magnificent racing scenes , so just keep it shelf . get letterbox one ... just georgeous !	1

after looking some reviews , i'll admit i'm bit confused . i think this made after gettysburg so any motivation remorse couldn't much " andersonville " .... younger civil war/war northern aggression student , i read mackinlay kantor book " andersonville " while there much vile see this film , it show why written word still most powerful weapon war . kantor descriptions writing defy depiction even most skilled set-dresser . nobody , i mean nobody , federal or confederate , officer or enlisted man , young or old come out situation such andersonville looking particularly well -- post-liberation photographs show it , just post-liberation photographs auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen . german film 1950s " doctor stalingrad " which purported show conditions german pow camp soviet union after world war ii , great film " hart war " depict relative shangri-la conditions ... someone who knows little pow situation during this great american conflict , i would recommend dvd " andersonville " but not isolation . it must tempered rounded knowledge conditions northern camps -- which appear history channel regularly ... recognition after prisoner exchange discontinued , nothing short genocide fairly grand scale could result . i recall television documentary trial andersonville commander , whic starred all people william shatner -- back 1970s or so ... which i quite impressed should resurrected . but present , films such " andersonville " replete underlying messages horrors war , humans make war then complain conditions which inevitable , despite our intelligence we not found alternative it -- yet . if this film inspires one intellect put his or her head solution this problem , then there no more andersonvilles .... this film shows how easily humans who civilized ( we think ) descend into psychosocial dynamics crowd , group , herd , plundering devaluing human life mere livestock	1

before i saw this fantastic animated masterpiece , my only contact japanese anime ' when my nieces nephews came visits ( they interested watching ninja/karate/sailor moon , etc ) . these cartoons , although hypnotic mesmerizing kids , seemed mindless no real message ( not there anything wrong ) . one evening this past january , i flipping through channels when i came upon tcm thursday night special tribute hayao miyazaki . i listened pre-feature info-guy describing great artistry storytelling this director thought " i'll give it 2 minutes then continue flipping " . after only ten minutes i found myself totally immersed experience . what beautifully crafted , artistically amazing , poignant study two young japanese students encouraging one follow their dreams they surprise themselves falling love . professional artist , i amazed superb quality artistry background panels , each one alone separate masterpiece , 3 dimensional feel movement/action . this not what i expected . most striking element this masterpiece ( risk trite ) slice modern japanese life/culture it imparted me . characters real , while same time decent , moral kids . there certain innocence characters totally refreshing endearing . they projected almost spiritual reverence their elders total respect their teachers . because japanese culture shown " user friendly " , their parents no fear their kids traveling bikes rapid transit throughout tokyo . it quite charming follow various characters through their daily activities reminded me my own childhood before our american culture became so dangerous . i now own many miyazaki films including porco rosso , kiki delivery service , princess mononoke , spirited away , castle sky , few others . however , my personal favorite still whisper heart . i can't wait introduce my nieces nephews these fantastic beautiful stories .	1
i liked this film alot agree most positive comments ( some negative .. swings remind me shock aka beyond door ii ) . my comment/question bit spoiler those who haven't seen it . it seems me ' infection ' metaphor medical malpractice it begins apathy lack caring patients . ending , upon re-watching it , i notice head nurse who returns gets ' infected ' when she doesn't want sign patient . ( clipboard scene ) . other medic ( emt ? ) insists so she finally signs it . seems doom her . that what i got film , i dig j-horror but much it cultural that what makes it so interesting . i lucky see ju two asian women who explained tons stuff i never would've understood so i'm sure there lots i didn't ' get ' infection .	1

" mothman prophecies " one most underrated contemporary horror films i've ever seen . i only saw this once awhile ago , but i remember amazed movie this good could swept under rug it seemingly . richard gere ( yeah , i know ) plays washington post reporter named john klein who loses his wife very curious car accident . after accident which purposely filmed so we don't know how or why it really happened , his terminally damaged wife starts drawing really weird pictures moth . she keeps asking klein if he saw this bird sorts or not , kind dracula-like figure two eyes too bright make one comfortable . first he insists he saw nothing but keeps pictures , childlike chilling images playing perennial part film later . patton best actor this movie . he plays gordon smallwood , outwardly small town nut actually man driven insane bizarre enigma this innocuous little town unknowingly houses . when klein shows up gordon house ( rifle shoved his face ) , it not accident . nothing this movie really . way pellington shoots scenes gordon losing his mind unforgettable -- it happens fizzy , weird video game type way which comes off very vividly . i've never liked laura linney too much always felt she belongs tv but she decent job connie mills , local sherrif who basically serves dramatic witness klein breakdowns real star movie -- indrid cold -- keeps calling him . only " exorcist " or " black christmas " , perhaps , i seen movie before which creepy , otherworldly voice becomes star . even when klein tries escape his obsession tear out jack phone , it keeps ringing ringing . this exercise derangement strange form hope . climax strike some impressive others senseless . bottom line : every horror fan should see this .	1

thornton , . . ( writer ) ( 1996 ) . sling blade . . meistrich ( producer ) . usa : criterion collection . thornton plays lead role carl , developmentally disabled ( autistic ? ) man his 40s who spent most his life small-town texas resident psychiatric hospital . his crime double homicide his mother her teenaged lover . we also learn his father mother him bury infant brother immediately after his birth while still alive . carl , whose heart seeking purity justice but whose mind not equipped deal well evil world , released hospital after 25 years becomes friends frank ( black ) , 12-year-old boy whose mother , linda ( canerday ) , hooked up abusive alcoholic boyfriend , doyle ( yoakam ) , whom she hopes go away his own accord . linda best friend her grocery store boss , vaughan ( ritter ) , who gay who stays small town he finds oppressive largely because his love linda frank but also because his own fears inability deal larger world . carl relationship frank father-protector figure grows , doyle becomes more threatening everyone safety , carl makes decision protect frank linda murdering doyle . when asked fellow resident ( walsh ) what world outside like , carl says simply it too big . this beautifully made movie struggle good evil its major concern development safety frank , young boy . carl enters this fallen world discover mother who suffering battered wife syndrome can't act way protect her son . vaughan , other good adult , equally incapable helping frank . his own part , frank despises doyle but too young helpless anything except seek protection carl . carl , portrayed thornton , idiot savant who masterful repairing small engines , equally adept providing shelter frank , who comes rely carl he would his own nurturing father . carl displays many characteristics servant leadership delineated spears ( greenleaf , beazley , beggs , spears , 2003 , pp . 16-19 ) , notably listening , empathizing , healing , his effect other players equally remarkable servant-leader terms . example , one scene portrays dinner vaughan holds his house frank , linda , carl , his boyfriend albert ( tim holder ) , developmentally disabled grocery store worker melinda ( christy ward ) whom vaughan matchmaking carl . scene understated contemplative its vignette community building , wry humor reveals fact everyone store knows vaughan albert lovers , which vaughan thought secret , echoing movie theme world " too big " - too callous mean-spirited sensitive people live unharmed lives . carl also displays qualities foresight commitment growth people his relationship frank . this ultimately leads him conclude only way frank grow up undamaged , implication doyle may actually become drunkenly enraged kill linda frank . carl ends up killing doyle act premeditated sacrifice dark it gets . he acts frank protector but also returns himself contrastingly small world mental hospital , where he spends most his time sitting chair , looking out window . there much more detail nuance this movie i can't capture couple paragraphs , but movie melancholy deep well worth watching . get some more flavor it , see http://imdb.com/title/tt0117666/quotes few pages dialogue excerpts	1

i love this movie . zombies , yakuza , samurai , possibly even vampire ( i think that what main villian ) crazy monkey yakuza man who pulls guns , literally , out his arse . what there not love ? i think whoever called " kung fu evil dead " most accurate description movie i could possibly imagine . plus , little knocks movie makes " matrix " really funny . however , i must warn you . not watch it english-dubbed ! it worst dubbing i ever heard . i owned this dvd months before girl i over wanted see it , but didn't want read subtitles . i am convinced there only two actors doing all voices english version . seriously , every male sounds like it same guy trying different voices . only worse english-dubbing i've ever heard dutch version " ichi killer , " but , least , funny how bad it sounds . also , r-rated version , which i saw first , actually cuts some important stuff out film . i rented r-rated version then bought special edition there two or three scenes i like , " ooooh ! so that why happened ! " seriously , they butchered film r-rated version . but if you like slightly campy , ultra-violent , let throw every idea we ever into one film type-movies , go it	1

intent director capture atmosphere or " flavor " elizabethan court . intrigue , alliances , deceit , ambitions , trechery emotions . addition he means show us elizabeth human thrust into power , all power demands . those points he got it right although people not quite clean good looking then . times brutal . toothache could kill you . lice everywhere . those who criticize historical accuracy complaints miss point . historically accurate film would span very very many hours or even more . movie probably could little longer it . worthy multiple viewings	1
i see lot positive reviews posted here ... historical luther not found this movie . no doubt audience predominantly lutheran . secular entertainment point view , i would agree them . 4 stars . attention detail excellent ; it well acted , well written , well casted . however , director eric till made luther into hero . he no hero . history reveals truth so glaringly absent film . only thing rang true luther anti-establishment , religious zealot reformer , just like jesus , ( only jesus hated gentiles , calling them " dogs swine ) . " i challenge till make " luther part 2 , " using excerpts luther own words below script . it smack hitler biography/// . disclaimer : if you lutheran , brace yourself . he blatently advocated slow genocide jews . hitler picked up what luther throwin ' down ... " jewish vermin ... shall their homes razed ... curfews set ... business banned ... " etc . this luther never portrayed . ad hominem or not , how lutheranism trusted when it founder such hateful individual ? jews their lies , martin luther " i made up my mind write no more either jews or against them . but since i learned these miserable accursed people not cease lure themselves even us , , christians , i published this little book , so i might found among those who opposed such poisonous activities jews who warned christians their guard against them . i would not believed christian could duped jews into taking their exile wretchedness upon himself . however , devil god world , wherever god word absent he easy task , not only weak but also strong . may god help us . amen . he not call them abraham children , but " brood vipers " [ matt . 3:7 ] . oh , too insulting noble blood race israel , they declared , " he demon ' [ matt 11:18 ] . our lord also calls them " brood vipers " ; furthermore john 8 [: 39 , 44 ] he states : " if you abraham children ye would what abraham .... you your father devil . it intolerable them hear they not abraham but devil children , nor they bear hear this today . therefore blind jews truly stupid fools ... now just behold these miserable , blind , senseless people . ... their blindness arrogance solid iron mountain . learn this , dear christian , what you doing if you permit blind jews mislead you . then saying truly apply , " when blind man leads blind man , both fall into pit " [ cf . luke 6:39 ] . you cannot learn anything them except how misunderstand divine commandments ... therefore your guard against jews , knowing wherever they their synagogues , nothing found but den devils which sheer self-glory , conceit , lies , blasphemy , defaming god men practiced most maliciously veheming his eyes them . moreover , they nothing but thieves robbers who daily eat no morsel wear no thread clothing which they not stolen pilfered us means their accursed usury . thus they live day day , together wife child , theft robbery , arch-thieves robbers , most impenitent security . however , they not acquired perfect mastery art lying ; they lie so clumsily ineptly anyone who just little observant easily detect it . but us christians they stand terrifying example god wrath . if i refute all other articles jewish faith , i should obliged write against them much long time they used inventing their lies -- , longer than two thousand years . ... christ his word hardly recognized because great vermin human ordinances . however , let this suffice time their lies against doctrine or faith . i not tell you earlier jew such noble , precious jewel god all angels dance when he farts ? alas , it cannot anything but terrible wrath god which permits anyone sink into such abysmal , devilish , hellish , insane baseness , envy , arrogance . if i avenge myself devil himself i should unable wish him such evil misfortune god wrath inflicts jews , compelling them lie blaspheme so monstrously , violation their own conscience . anyway , they their reward constantly giving god lie . no , one should toss out these lazy rogues seat their pants . ... but then eject them forever this country . , we heard , god anger them so intense gentle mercy only tend make them worse worse , while sharp mercy reform them but little . therefore , any case , away them ! over above we let them get rich our sweat blood , while we remain poor they suck marrow our bones . i brief , dear princes lords , those you who jews under your rule -- if my counsel not please your , find better advice , so you we all rid unbearable , devilish burden jews , lest we become guilty sharers before god lies , blasphemy , defamation , curses which mad jews indulge so freely wantonly against person our lord jesus christ , this dear mother , all christians , all authority , ourselves . not grant them protection , safe-conduct , or communion us .... . this faithful counsel warning i wish cleanse exonerate my conscience . let government deal them this respect , i suggested . but whether government acts or not , let everyone least guided his own conscience form himself definition or image jew . however , we must avoid confirming them their wanton lying , slandering , cursing , defaming . nor dare we make ourselves partners their devilish ranting raving shielding protecting them , giving them food , drink , shelter , or other neighborly acts . therefore we christians , turn , obliged not tolerate their wanton conscious blasphemy . accordingly , it must dare not considered trifling matter but most serious one seek counsel against this save our souls jews , , devil eternal death . what shall we christians this rejected condemned people , jews ? since they live among us , we dare not tolerate their conduct , now we aware their lying reviling blaspheming . if we , we become sharers their lies , cursing blaspemy . thus we cannot extinguish unquenchable fire divine wrath , which prophets speak , nor we convert jews . prayer fear god we must practice sharp mercy see whether we might save least few glowing flames . we dare not avenge ourselves . vengeance thousand times worse than we could wish them already them throat . i shall give you my sincere advice : first set fire their synagogues or schools bury cover dirt whatever not burn , so no man ever again see stone or cinder them . this honor our lord christendom , so god might see we christians , not condone or knowingly tolerate such public lying , cursing , blaspheming his son his christians . whatever we tolerated past unknowingly - i myself unaware it - pardoned god . but if we , now we informed , protect shield such house jews , existing right before our very nose , which they lie , blaspheme , curse , vilify , defame christ us ( heard above ) , it would same if we doing all this even worse ourselves , we very well know . second , i advise their houses also razed destroyed . they pursue them same aims their synagogues . instead they might lodged under roof or barn , like gypsies . this bring home them they not masters our country , they boast , but they living exile captivity , they incessantly wail lament us before god . third , i advise all their prayer books talmudic writings , which such idolatry , lies , cursing blasphemy taught , taken them ... fourth , i advise their rabbis forbidden teach henceforth pain loss life limb . they justly forfeited right such office holding poor jews captive saying moses ( deuteronomy 17 [: 10 ff . ]) which he commands them obey their teachers penalty death , although moses clearly adds : " what they teach you accord law lord . " those villains ignore . they wantonly employ poor people obedience contrary law lord infuse them this poison , cursing , blasphemy . same way pope also held us captive declaration matthew 16 [: 18 ] , " you peter , " etc ., inducing us believe all lies deceptions issued his devilish mind . he not teach accord word god , therefore he forfeited right teach . fifth , i advise safe-conduct highways abolished completely jews . they no business countryside , since they not lords , officials , tradesmen , or like . let they stay home ... sixth , i advise usury prohibited them , all cash treasure silver gold taken them put aside safekeeping . reason such measure , said above , they no other means earning livelihood than usury , it they stolen robbed us all they possess . such money should now used no other way than following : whenever jew sincerely converted , he should handed one hundred , two hundred , or three hundred florins , personal circumstances may suggest . this he could set himself up some occupation support his poor wife children , maintenance old or feeble . such evil gains cursed if they not put use god blessing good worthy cause . seventh , i commend putting flail , ax , hoe , spade , distaff , or spindle into hands young , strong jews jewesses letting them earn their bread sweat their brow , imposed children adam ( gen 3 [: 19 ]} . it not fitting they should let us accursed goyim toil sweat our faces while they , holy people , idle away their time behind stove , feasting farting , top all , boasting blasphemously their lordship over christians means our sweat . no , one should toss out these lazy rogues seat their pants . but what happen even if we burn down jews ' synagogues forbid them publicly praise god , pray , teach , utter god name ? they still keep doing it secret . if we know they doing this secret , it same if they doing it publicly . our knowledge their secret doings our toleration them implies they not secret after all thus our conscience encumbered it before god . accordingly , it must dare not considered trifling matter but most serious one seek counsel against this save our souls jews , , devil eternal death . my advice , i said earlier , : first , their synagogues burned down , all who able toss sulphur pitch ; it would good if someone could also throw some hellfire . would demonstrate god our serious resolve evidence all world it ignorance we tolerated such houses , which jews reviled god , our dear creator father , his son most shamefully up till now but we now given them their due reward . i wish i ask our rulers who jewish subjects exercise sharp mercy toward these wretched people , suggested above , see whether this might not help ( though it doubtful ) . they must act like good physician who , when gangrene set , proceeds without mercy cut , saw , burn flesh , veins , bone , marrow . such procedure must also followed this instance . burn down their synagogues , forbid all i enumerated earlier , force them work , deal harshly them , moses wilderness , slaying three thousand lest whole people perish . they surely not know what they doing ; moreover , people possessed , they not wish know it , hear it , or learn it . there it would wrong merciful confirm them their conduct . if this not help we must drive them out like mad dogs , so we not become partakers their abominable blasphemy all their other vices thus merit god wrath damned them . i my duty . now let everyone see his . i am exonerated .

i took look first dvd this series after reading malcolm gladwell books , harford " undercover economist " , " freakonomics " , " long tail " . i didn't expect too much , then ended up devouring all six hours . my education economics almost entirely summarized books above , so overview economic history , i found this series terrific . three disc , six hour long public televsion documentary , series very comprehensive one hundred or so years it covers . considering i slept through my one college economics class , i also surprised find it entertaining its " battle ideas " take economics its demonstrations success failure many nations under many economic systems . i don't think it produced accomodate political agenda everyone watching it ; six hours quite enough . because pbs produced " commanding heights " , i honestly expected it six hour screed evils walmart foreign labor . it actually quite opposite ; demonstration how free , competitive markets very limited regulation provide best overall economic conditions while government controlled markets lead empty stores bread lines . mixed economies work only short term solutions booms busts completely unregulated free compeitition . not really " laissez faire " economics , but very discriminative use government regulation create best economic conditions --" hold loosely " economics , maybe . very loosely , probably . whole series nutshell me . series also presents interesting view how world leadership works way you'll never see presidential documentary or six o'clock news . when your decisions affect hundreds millions , you use best ideas , presented best minds careful not your decision swayed dogmatic screamers who only point out problems , but never present well planned solutions . however , screamers essential . leadership decisions far always correct . disc 3 , when one attendees wto conference asked where he would 25 years earlier , he answered he'd outside protesting . now , he felt real solutions inside . labor leader interviewed said it wasn't job protesters solutions , but check power letting failings power known . three cheers both those answers i think . it role leaders come up best plan they think possible public let their dissatisfaction known via their right protest . i see thomas jefferson loving whole idea . there interesting stories told documentary : how milton friedman professors chicago school economics recruited around world their ideas implemented save national economies ; how economists called help win polish revolution ; how margaret thacher took out friedrich von hayek book free market economies out meeting tossed it table ; how von hayek wait until his old age until his theories embraced ; how richard nixon other conservatives abandoned their posts free market economics watched things get worse . i also learned one problems free trade ( other than exportation domestic jobs ) not so much low wages paid foreign countries , but how many these countries don't grant their citizens property rights , so even if their overall conditions improve , they never prosper because they can't really make claim anything they own . it seems their could definitely some simple policy decisions made there would improve things . one wonder why they not made .	1

i bought this without previously knowing anything it , not knowing it sequel . i taken title , blurb . that it . it sounded like really romantic film , one i might identify , i've always wondered what would happen if i met my first love again , if i would same feelings . after watching very , very long trailer , i slightly disappointed , i only managed half hour into film , before i started doze off . it so incredibly boring ! although i wouldn't say i normally mind " real time " films , it all set mid-late afternoon , very dull time day if you ask me . it only time day director richard linklater would shoot scenes film . he felt it added reality film , often relied actors get perfect takes right time , it shows , it shot mere 15 days . but it nothing but talk meandering around parisian streets parts i watched . i just didn't identify it . nothing happened . i hated two actors . i don't normally like ethan hawke anyway , but i thought i might able ignore this , but no i disliked julie delpy too . i wouldn't recommend this film anyone , although i know other reviewers gonna disagree me , but it just wasn't what i expected .	-1

friend once who snickered my enthusiasm this movie . brainless cretin described it " chick flick " i give him long winded explanation why he once more way off beam . " goodwill hunting " classic guy movie guys who guy things . above all other story elements , this movie boyhood friends uncompromising loyalty those friendships . there scenes here should make you miss buddies you turned age , those great friends who there when you your first drink , chased your first skirt got into your first bar brawl . hunting genius becomes crux film . he genius , yes . but mostly , he young man typical frustrations misgivings come age . he issues girls , issues law , issues his own place world . this quickly became one my all-time favorites because it movie endless depth substance . story young punk criminal record outshining rest mathematical minds compelling start . so attempt bedraggled but committed psychiatrist reach boy weird friendship forms them . south boston serves beautiful shabby backdrop hunting feels himself drifting away his buddies his genius gets more attention world universities prestige he unfamiliar . he wants continue working construction hanging out seedy bars his friends , rather than his fluke ability exploited men greedy ambitions concerns over petty things like tenure . matt damon stellar streetwise hunting , orphan attitude . robin williams leaves his goofiness behind plays aging psychiatrist who once tough young man just like kid he trying help . while praising pair , no one should overlook talents ben affleck , who credible actor before he started landing tabloid covers . relationship damon affleck powerful . latter knows his childhood friend bound great things prods him achieve silent , macho way good friends .

i'm good friend haskell wexler , edited his film , " medium cool , " 1968 . this film came out year before required viewing all us -- especially because way it made scripted story look like documentary . i loved film back then but hadn't seen it again until last week . i admit i bit worried it would appear dated irrelevant . quite contrary ! given events since 9/11 , iraq , madrid , london , lebanon -- west global struggle against islam -- this film more important relevant today than ever . there one sequence particular which three arab women disguise themselves europeans order slip bombs past french colonial checkpoints plant them locations where they kill maximum number europeans . i won't spoil extraordinary suspense this sequence telling you whether or not they succeed . they not suicide bombers , but they place their deadly packages they look around people they kill . it simply one best pieces pure cinema ever	1

i never heard this film before i saw it sale target . fan johnny depp , i picked up last copy store under ten bucks . film opens , i thought , " well , i guess there reason why movies you've never heard go sale . " but , even i thought this , there still quality this film captivated me . even though pacing slow first , images dialogue seamed saying , " if you pay attention , i'm pretty important . " luckily , little voice right , film picked up steam it moved . now , not misunderstand me : no point this fast paced film . rather , your interest taken captive pieces dialogue imagery give film near-deat dream-like quality . more you see film , more you think you may understand , but , same time , more dream-like it becomes . others bemoaned grotesque portrayals supporting roles , yet this , too , leaves you sense maybe all not it seems . film draws close , nothing concrete laid into your lap . there no nice tidy " explain it all me so i understand this totality " wrap-up . no , instead , you free allow your mind wander questions reality , death , dreams , fate . weren't we told all , even opening train ride , this how things would progress ? william blake dead ? this actual william blake ? this exactly we saw , just incredibly cruel descent into fateful end ? film begs , perfect , multiple viewings . enjoy it every time	1
this film really spectacular . very opening(which slightly disorienting-but becomes clear quickly ) , it weaves tale filled some very odd fascinating characters . nicholson plays radio deejay sorts spouts some fictionalized , but engrossingly told tales . story itself deals his visit his brother-played bruce dern , who he must attempt talk out some financial scheming . dern turns fine performance-comparable his performance smile(very different characters , both great performances ) . ellen burstyn also terrific . photography laszlo kovacs ranks up his best . welcome follow-up rafelson five easy pieces(a follow-up doesn't get press it deserves ) . looks beautiful dvd	1
trevor ( osment ) good kid living hard life . he constantly taking care himself while his single mother ( helen hunt , pitch perfect ) works job after job he continually battle her her alcohol problem , she hides bottles he finds drains them . this story mother-son relationship heart ' pay it forward ' , actual paying it forward ( school project trevor comes up ) many ways sub-plot here , not other way around . you see , trevor bright young boy ( 11 or so ) whose new teacher ( kevin spacey , always brilliant ) gives them ' beginning year ' assignment come up way change world , better . he doesn't feel any kids actually come up anything substantial , but then again he never student quite like trevor . trevor comes up plan , utopian idea ( now look up :p ) where one person something good 3 people who turn something good 3 more people , never same people , always someone different , idea , rediculous it may sound actually worked word it got out reached struggling news reporter ( jay mohr ) who decides story trevor his idea . like i said , all this nothing more than sub-plot . heart soul this story bond forms these 3 unlikely souls . mother whose always trying so hard right thing but life her can't make right choices . teacher who afraid change fear hurting anymore than he already boy caught middle heart gold . your story what touching moving story it . helen hunt top her game this beautiful story learning love , kevin spacey , always brilliant , convincing heart breaking his sicerity . young haley joel osment brilliant young actor i'm sure , promise he showed movies like this one , a.i. his oscar nominated performance sixth sense , he come back guns blazing once he through awkward stages those teenage years ! great film oscar ignored , but thats nothing new it ?	1

this surely one most seriously underrated mystery thrillers around , which shame since director sam raimi , just before hitting jackpot " spider-man " franchise , assembled wildly improbable cast inhabit admittedly lurid though constantly involving 2001 movie . i town southernmost tip chile when i first saw this movie hotel room which just happen hbo . not even outside splendor midnight sun could tear me away watching movie tv set back then . co-written billy bob thornton ( upon whose mother psychic gifts story based ) tom epperson , plot revolves around disappearance jessica starlet , daughter wealthy resident georgia backwater town . tired blind alleys , police begrudgingly recruit annie wilson , single mother three sons , who lost her husband factory accident now earn living tarot reading psychic/fortune teller . annie thinks she finds suspect donnie barksdale , abusive , white-trash husband one her most devoted customers , valerie . complicating matters annie her attraction wayne collins , her eldest son teacher jessica fiancee ; buddy cole , annie customers , suicidal mechanic traumatized parental abuse he received child . while it not perfectly constructed , sometimes excessive screenplay contains lot layers but remains true characters ' voices motivations throughout . raimi expert direction full sumptuous southern gothic visuals genuine tension escalates over course story . credit needs given jamie anderson cinematography neil spisak production design establishing such heady atmosphere perfect labyrinth plot . some actors really surprised me strong turns , including katie holmes spoiled , baby-faced debutante jessica ; greg kinnear seemingly stalwart wayne ; keanu reeves especially visceral chilling unrepentant wife-beater donnie ; giovanni ribisi deeply troubled buddy . smallish role valerie , hilary swank makes her moments count she cringes donnie scarifying dominance over her . but it wondrous cate blanchett who pulls it all together her multi-dimensional performance annie . convincing southern accent , she reveals hidden layers her character beautifully she tries recover loss her husband , protect her children make sense psychic revelations traumatize her us . dvd short extras - fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast crew interviews , movie trailer video neko case " furniture room lullaby " which perfectly reflects haunting soundtrack . definitely seek this one out if you looking atmospheric , character-driven thriller not condescend viewer	1

" broken flowers " realistic movie explosions , gun fights , car chases . real life nobody acts like this or talks like this . that not say movie realistic good , but it helps if somebody least resembles human . bill murray meets up old girlfriends he hasn't seen 20 years , these meetings ridiculous . real life people show more emotion or some type reaction , they usually talk . this movie they just sit there stare each other almost nothing say . why this interesting ? it torture . when they finally talk , everything said random vague . reality people try carry normal conversation . even strangest people it , i've seen it . people say director jim jarmusch takes " minimalist " approach . nothing " spelled out you " , you " think " . " if you don't get it , watch your explosions movie " . it reminds me modern abstract painting , one blank white canvas except orange square . people rave it deep meaning it hanging met . meanwhile i paint orange square blank canvas . so you . i also make this movie , just give me some cameras , cinematographer some money . while watching , my head i filling dialogue characters , my dialogue lot more interesting than anything these people say . i enjoyed bill murray " lost translation " . his deap-pan performance worked there . least movie characters something say , stuff happened . here we long shots bill murray laying couch , or just simply staring into space . looong shots . only character vaguely resembled human winston , bill murray neighbor . he somehwat amusing he actually talked ! i don't need movies mirror reality enjoy them , nor i need everything spelled out me . my favorite type painting impressionism , which looks nothing like reality if you stare it . but right perspective good one looks more realistic than photorealistic painting . this movie , orange square nothing but orange square , people staring into space nothing but people staring into space	-1

i remember when " willow " first came out big screen . i remember how cool it watch skull-helmeted general kael ride onto screen . i loved swordplay madmartigan . trolls creepiest things i've ever seen . flash forward twenty-eight years , " willow " lost some its luster . it doesn't appeal me much it when i youngster . however , it still great film watch your family . those uneducated , " willow " tale one willow ufgood , little man who stumbles upon child " giant " person . this particular child bears mark which proclaims her person who eventually overthrow evil powerful queen bavmorda . bavmorda sent out her warriors murder every baby kingdom until she finds one mark . when dog-like beasts attack willow nelwyn village , he instructed take child give her first daikini he finds . this where madmartigan enters scenery . he mildly agrees help willow his quest , but things eventually turn into one great escape after . climactic battle good evil inevitable . willow played warwick davis . fans horror know him leprechaun " leprechaun " films . fans sci-fi know him playing wicket , ewok friend princess leia " return jedi . " he also provided body marvin " hitchhiker guide galaxy . " rest cast built up huge future stars , little legends , established character actors . billy barty bit role nelwyn village wizard . val kilmer portrays madmartigan , slightly oafish , very deadly swordsman who aids willow his quest . everyone should know kilmer . he tons films " real genius " " island dr. moreau " his legendary turn doc holliday " tombstone . " jean marsh portrays bavmorda , , much like reviewer stated , she seems channeling evil queens older disney flicks . joanne whalley ( sorsha ) pat roach ( kael ) round out very reliable cas t.t he special effects look very dated compared today films . however , it should stated this film early pioneer modern special effects . there even documentary dvd explaining beginnings " morphing . " overall , this film aged relatively well far family film . it rather violent moments , but it overall safe film watch your kids long they handle violence level films such 80 fantasy fest , " krull . " i don't recall much bad language all , but warned there quite few deaths this film , impaling swords eaten very " rancor " monster-like two-headed dragon . you'll also notice number references bible , " lord rings " books . if you grew up this film i , you'll probably enjoy memories film . however , it rather boring times adults . i'd still add it my collection if i you , if no other reason but enjoy it your own children see amazement their eyes once sparkled yours .	1

it hard know where begin this one . movie immaculately filmed one greatest directors all time , given just most perfect presentation i've ever seen dvd . i guess i'll start print : it magnificent , beautiful , golden colors , sharp focus , barely speck dust film . one would expect kurosawa film , composition feast eyes , beautiful formal balances coming most mundane elements shot . ( george lucas very influenced kurosawa many ways , but this sort beautiful , balanced composition one thing he never mastered . ) then there score . most people might not immediately think score when discussing kurosawa film , but i struck here how powerful distinctive it , while same time it never gets way film . then there sets : simple , yet used maximum effect . this not big budget film hollywood standards ( though it most expensive japanese film up time ) , but it feels far more epic than any recent , very expensive star wars " prequels , " which just goes show it takes more make epic than just money . kurosawa reportedly only used something like 200 horsemen , yet you'll think you're seeing far more . then there cast . tatsuya nakadai , lord ichimonji , manages perfectly portray man going man who both frightening his stubbornness sympathetic his pathos same time . not easy job , especially under ton makeup made him look far older than he . three sons , played akira terao , jinpachi nezu especially daisuke ryu ( insightful loyal saburo ) distinctive well-developed . androgynous peter ( first name billed only ) kyoami memorable his flamboyant , almost drag-queen gyrations taunting aging , increasingly senile warlord insights into his predicament . yet standout performance , one i always remember , stunning mieko harada lady kaede . while ran supposedly loose retelling king lear , kaede more lady macbeth than anything else . she two very memorable scenes both involve severed heads . while screenplay riffs lear , it also makes some notable changes . three daughters replaced three sons . this " lear " goes mad not because daughter love but because , apparently , weight wars fought past . young lord very odds image we see beginning film , man wishing make peace his demons . we discover through backstory he killed , kidnapped waged much violence bring together his kingdom , yet now he just wants peace goodwill . i thinking adage what goes around comes around , wondered if hidetora himself ever came this realization . it what he thinking he emerged burning castle after tremendous battle , dazed , wordless ? scene , shot without ambient sound but haunting score ( composed toru takemitsu ) , must go down one greatest moments film , example how cinema used way no other art form . bonus features both bountiful meaningful . first there full-length commentary film scholar stephen prince , though i confess i've not yet listened it . director sidney lumet gives brief appreciation kurosawa ran . he likens film late beethoven quartets or seventh symphony . such comparisons often come off glib or meaningless , but this actually struck chord me . i indeed think comparison ran energies seventh apt , introspection reminds me late quartets , particularly op . 132 . second disc , we a.k. , 75 minute documentary kurosawa life . ( case you've seen recent pbs documentary kurosawa , this one different . ) then comes half hour film making ran , which shows what grueling shoot it must , going every day base mount fuji often working there even night . finally there 35-minute video piece exploring costumes ran , well new video interview tatsuya nakadai ( lord hidetora ) . there also color booklet interviews kurosawa composer takemitsu . short , there enough supplementary materials here keep any fan movie or director happy weeks . many criterion releases defined what dvds , but this title just takes cake . what more could one ask , short summoning kurosawa beyond talk film ? even if you own ran one its other video versions , they all vastly inferior this release . if you've never seen film , or any work akira kurosawa , this probably best place you could start . highly highly recommended	1

i first saw this movie sixties , when its expose rome decadent jet set still some shock value . four decades later , when mating habits movie stars endlessly dissected across globe , trials tribulations sweet life feel numbingly familiar . what left story marcello , ( marcello mastroianni ) gossip columnist , what happens him during series loosely structured night wanderings . trailing marcello through rome , we learn his character discern his fate . he aspired once intellectual , idealizes his friend steiner , imagining steiner life perfect blend serious purpose family warmth . what happens steiner provides movie only true emotional shock . marcello traveling salesman father shows up unexpectedly rome . marcello wants him stay longer so they get know each other better . but , after raucous evening town , old man bolts once again . we see source marcello emotional guardedness . this guardedness affects his romantic relationships . there emma , his steady girlfriend , who wants commitment he unwilling provide . he dallies instead movie stars , such sylvia ( anita ekberg , whose zaftig charms show us how much standards cinematic beauty changed over forty years . ) his most interesting relationship maddelena ( anouk aimee ) decadent aristocrat . there definitely chemistry them , but neither them put aside their party masks long enough explore it . his most moving encounter young girl country , waitress seaside resort . jaded marcello drawn her innocence optimism , because it takes him back his younger self , fresh arrival big city . movie end , after debauched night , he sees this girl beach dawn , standing other side channel . she shouts him , gestures , but wind snatches away her words . he can't connect her . shrugging , he turns back his bleary-eyed troupe nightlifers . this rich movie , its energetic inventions keep you hooked , even though it almost three hours long . you would expect one cinema world masters , there lot artful filmmaking here - innovative night photography , playful musical score brilliant nino rota , arresting visuals , such opening shot statue jesus airlifted helicopter over city . many fellini major preoccupations display well . his nostalgia simple , natural life country played out marcello interactions young waitress . carnival italian catholicism brought hilariously life when two young children claim visions virgin mary way jerking chains their elders . adults , desperate miracle , swarm site . marcello paparazzi could care less , long there enough spectacle squeeze out story or visual . pretensions urban intellectuals wittily skewered during party scene steiner where bombastic people talk past each other several languages . some most appealing aspects fellini movies aren't all evident la dolce vita . his warmth towards his characters , instance . starlets , aristocrats tabloid journalists marcello runs aren't very likable . without his easy charm , this would cold movie indeed . also , fellini best there using cinematic imagery create dreamlike flow his stories . but this movie full abrupt , even awkward transitions , though fellini , following marcello through warren rome streets , keeps hitting dead ends which force him back up order go forward . although fellini starting move away his neorealistic roots la dolce vita , he doesn't move very far . when he finally returned those roots , he made amarcord , amazing fusion realism surrealism . me , it fellini best movie , perhaps one greatest movies ever made . la dolce vita isn't good amarcord , much its shock value diluted time , but it worth seeing mastroianni seemingly effortless virtuosity privilege watching great director capture passing parade .	1

this movie loads fun ! it truly " little engine could " ! it easy point finger knock down points film because it low budget stuff , but there really isn't much room so this one . sideline secrets takes few seeds manages plant entire orchard . what i am saying fact this film best what it end it comes out true winner . actors great . i think we seeing some them bigger projects near future they clearly passion comfort what they . story very dark . it touches upon lot controversial subject matter involving molestation , rape , physical abuse , alcoholism , more . but , dont get too frightened , although much subject matter serious , movie knows how tie it all into somewhat complicated yet very entertaining story . romantic story core nice see . i am glad see movies like this climbing charts . it reached #2 bestseller spot popular online retail store . me it no wonder why . sideline secrets truly gem found many .	1
review disclaimer : my review based vhs release , anticipation this deluxe edition dvd , released october 24 , 2006 . whenever i think this movie , i get chills followed imagined warm heat . this movie fire . actors , passion , plot , settings . everything . everything ! i recommend this anyone older than 18 . it great classic holds its own , any audience ! this movie everything i love ! great plot ! passion ! sex ! beautiful women ! william hurt shines . i honestly thought , when i saw this movie , william hurt would go classic hollywood actor , picking up all types roles we've seen mel gibson , bruce willis , tom hanks picked up , over past 25 years . while mr. hurt resigned himself lesser known roles , smaller parts ; certainly non-hollywood roles . seeing this film , first time , young people ( old , matter ) might re-introduced this fine actor , showing them what many us enjoyed 25 years ago . some my favorite memorable scenes : chair through window ; ted danson peter lowenstein dancing moonlight ; windchimes matty porch ; hot florida nights ; ned racine ( william hurt ) realization scamed ; etc . if any movie , over past 25 years , most deserving sequel , or pre-quel , this it . i don't want spoil anything , but watch this movie , tell me if you don't agree , this movie deserves follow up story . not really " cliff-hanger " but it leaves you longing more . yet , still very satisfying . great movie ! mc white said : check it out !!	1
i bought this only because i loved first one , hoping it wasn't terrible second . after i watched it i so impressed . first all i loved it really didn't anything first , aside cassidy katherine cousin , sharing same last name ( there only one reference katherine sebastian beginning ) . it much better than different actors playing old characters , which drags movie down alot . i thought story great , good twists . whole cast very attractive , which can't hurt either . " bad " characters all pretty likeable , aside one , all well end . best thing this movie character cassidy . i sarted out hating her , ended up really liking her her realness , honesty she not try hide she b*tch . this actress particularly good job , pulling off both loveable , complete brat same time . i would definetly reccomend this movie .	1
saint ralph perfect movie hand entertaining houseguests or cheering someone up , since most folks haven't already seen it , it uplifting , it wide appeal ( sports , coming-of-age , dramatic storyline , funny ) . much this movie humor misunderstanding . ralph , 9th grader , gets lot wrong , perhaps since he so little guidance , his war hero father dead , his hospitalized mom entering coma , living unsupervised home faking headmaster he staying grandparents . plus , he got more typical 14-year-old problems , he object ridicule classmates can't control his hormones . after little pool incident , headmaster attempts resolve ralph horny " energy surplus " problem sentencing him cross-country team . after his coach says , " let go , 180 days left til boston marathon , " ralph asks running it , coach says he kidding , anyone team winning it would " miracle rival loaves fishes . " taken literally nurses statement it'd take miracle his mom recover , scrawny , smoker ralph then sets out win boston miracle , defiance opposition headmaster . ralph gets misguided ( comedic ) instruction out-of-date books how train fellow student ( aspiring nun/crush-interest ) requirements producing miracle . despite catholic setting , this not religious movie , secularists could easily point out ralph theology all confused movie hard work good intentions , while believers might see it picturing god responsiveness sincere , crying hearts , even if our theology not all formulated rightly . artistically , movie wonderful well , acting impeccable music fitting . ebert roeper right applying what usually cliche , " beautiful gem . " won awards toronto , palm springs , seatle . ( brief poolhouse backside nudity , some taking lord name vain . neither gratuitous .	1

all i say wow . i heard this series good but monumental understatement . this series deep . this not funny , fun series . this series full suspence , action drama beginning end . you begin yuji , learn how survive world infested giant bugs called blue , whose sole purpose destroy humanity . he meets marlene , emotionless soldier who cares nothing but getting mission completed no matter cost . story continues , there many fantasic episodes some you won't like but they benefit whole story amazing way . each episode leaves you wanting see next one . episode 26 finishes series absolutly shocking way . i'm not going spoil it anyone but you see it . you see other 25 episodes first or it won't make any sense . believe me , you won't all disappointed buying this series . this series box set also comes blue gender movie : warrior . this only downside this box set . movie sucks . if you watch it before series it might good but after movie really sucks . it just retelling series condensed form few changes . i didn't like it but you might different opinion . overall , i give this series five stars because it really earned them . i also liked dvd case like book . all you put it your shelf . buy this series if you want see amazing anime	1

" predator " one my favorite science-fiction thrillers starring arnold schwarzenegger . when i first saw this film i thought it going formulaic sci-fi film . it not . idea group hardened american commando stalked hunted down like prey alien world terrific . scenes where predator hunting them outstanding . i liked everything film , not nit-pick any flaws . when commando wipe up guerilla fighter jungle , if this just cake walk them , you don't expect what awaiting them . what awaiting them one hell awesome enemy . when jesse ventura carrying his mini-gun , you get impression there more than one predator , maybe even quite few , however film predator , not predator(s ) . when it begins take out team ease you just know your'e one heck ride . especially ease which predator takes them out . this chameleon type predator not your typical alien . this one manhunt -- literally . film highly recommended . it one wild ride great suspenseful film . i can't understand why critics blasted it when it released . thrill factor incredible . highly recommended .

night iguana always my favorite films based tennessee williams plays it great see it this sharp clean dvd . film belongs john huston much it williams that no bad thing . huston transfers play screen sympathy , empathy respect its characters , dilemmas , - most all - its lyricism . like play , film engages mind well emotions we discover bits ourselves nearly all characters . huston always good director actors here he brings out best uniformly excellent if disparate cast . richard burton , still his prime , gives one his best screen performances - acting his entire body soul instead just letting his expressive eyes wonderful voice doing all work . perhaps huston knew just how push right buttons , or perhaps script location inspired him . or maybe he simply responded sparks other cast members . ava gardner quite magnificent role finally lets her act instead mere decoration . her earthy portrayal middle-aged widow seems take her back her southern roots she displays her character wide range raw emotions just right mixture abandon self-control . against dynamic duo burton gardner , debroah kerr wisely underplays her part vaguely artistic new england spinster , getting maximum effect most subtle inflections her voice thoughtful half-pauses . such company , sue lyon fight hold her own so much through costuming she acting . but easily matching stars film grayson hall repressed decidedly butch leader group women whose burton character taking guided tour mexico . her performance more layers than initially apparent , if i remember correctly , earned hall oscar nomination . just side comment previous reviewer who went out his way criticize cyril delevanti portrayal 97 year old poet grandfather kerr character . this person obviously very little experience either old people or poetry . delevanti performance good anyone else film produces its genuinely touching moments . if i concentrated mostly actors it because night iguana such character-driven work . elements such photography , sound , music etc . good because they nothing detract performances or wonderful dialogue . only possibly distraction location but then mexico becomes almost character itself . extras dvd show just how important location film , yet decision film black white remains correct one . it draws us much closer into world rev . . lawrence shannon his temptors tormentors . brilliant film stood up well over years one i never tire seeing . new dvd makes it look good new adds couple interesting , if brief , extras . definitely classic	1

i am big fan office , mockumentaries mentioned , just good old regular documentaries , which often funny unintentionally . i thought there few bright moments this otherwise strained mockumentary . but not nearly enough make it worth watching . i just didn't like it all . although i must say it mocked everything bad today affluent yuppie culture . my money i'll take utterly horrid couple best show - lawyers braces ! my mac , starbucks ! it sooo good .

we seen so many films , documentaries , photo essays it difficult accept this particular film all happened accident . likely hood two film makers , cameras loaded ready , driven tragic event real life heros victims still unbelieveable even though i first saw this historical footage few years back . it not documentary , it real time life happening ( like security camera ) before viewers eyes . must see .	1
hyperbole won't seem appropriate most people , but me this single most un-enjoyable movie i've ever seen , ever . every aspect it painful . first , production values : this movie just ugly . i guess biological computers supposed novel or deep concept , but it just disgusting really very poor looking . times i thought they just rooted through medical examiner dumpster gather props . i understand you can't really nice props low-budget movie , but setting technology so central plot you think they could've paid decent production designer . everyone says this not " special effects " movie ideas behind it what counts , but plenty low budget movies didn't look this bad able convey something new . acting : just one thing sea annoyances here jude law accent . it terrible , he lets his native one slip several times . it distracting sloppy . dialogue just bad overall , so i blame writer most this . this movie not " misunderstood . " it objectively bad movie . it unentertaining , boring , scrabbling significance only scraggly-bearded philosophy majors care dogmatize . lot reviews said it better see it black comedy , but this movie only unintentionally funny , if all . i'd give it zero stars if i could , i'm trying warn people away this turd	-1
this dvd set i've waiting all these years ! i've mash fan since 1972 , this ultimate dvd collection . all elevan seasons , including goodbye , farewell amen . also includes feature turn off laugh track , reportedly , cast never liked laugh track . hours special features like mash 30th anniversary show much more ! you view scenes not broadcast television over 20 years due editing commercial time . blooper feature short length , packaging needs alot space store , but this well worth price . only way this could better if alan alda delivered it personally .	1
i remember enjoying this when i rented it quite some time ago . i thought some street conversations little off didn't feel right , but i impressed over all . i writing review ' company ' trying figure out why i kept thinking there something wrong picture . it this film , actually . blockbuster rental very dark overly saturated ntsc . however , i remember adjusting my nec studio monitor just this dvd quite shaken how much dynamic range they'd squeezed into it ... more than usually possible ntsc . picture mastering seemed geared more playback pro equipment , rather than neutral one home . either they didn't use ntsc-calibrated monitor , or something like general gamma value botched before master sent duplication ... maybe just moved decimal point . it hassle compensate this playback end , but odd way almost worth it such film-like curve probably wouldn't possible otherwise . not necessarily bad thing , but it worth pointing out it might not look right your screen . i'm not sure if newer pressings different .	1

one major problems i encounter people who viewed this cinematic masterpiece kurosawa film pretentious boring . more importantly , truth readily available viewer if he or she just watches film . however , point film . what truth ! we viewer foreknowledge crime criminal charged . " rashomon " always one my favorite films akira kurosawa , although i not place it top five his greatest . but kurosawa fascinating insight into truth dares us look what we hold " truth . " there any absolute truths ? if so , whose ? this film attempts let viewer decide who telling truth . relativism , [ corollary skepticism ] truth or belief truth relative position person who making statement . which turn directly questions ideal objectivity : since this undermines belief people get outside themselves order get truth . therefore , if truth depends observer viewpoint , how there universal truth -- or even absolute truth ? i believe kurosawa attempting show audience although truth may not absolute , there still truths . therefore , even though each characters kurosawa thrown into this film give us different viewpoint truth they witnessed it , individual themselves give enough their perception [ through their own objectivity ] , which truth still found . kurosawa so wonderful way giving four different versions murder rape : one witness , three versions people involved crime . me , film telling many ways , some which i am sure i am wrong , however , film fascinating way kurosawa uses non-verbal area film : visuals themselves . many kurosawa films , cinematography all talking . much gathered this film just looking scenery , trying not focus too much dialogue ; visuals themselves much , if not more , story . who telling truth ? why there different versions ? this i leave others decide themselves . film , attempt get truth really fascinating . telling sign kurosawa knew what he doing especially evident when looking reviewers amazon disagreeing each other . kurosawa what he set out : what truth ? toshiro mifune bandit who charged crime , he terrific acting job . movie also stars great takashi shimura woodsman who discovers scene crime . this classic highly recommended . however , it may not appeal all viewers . rent it first . [ i own it ] but since this film foreign , ambiguous many areas , some viewers may problems it . [ stars : 4.5	1

i found this outstanding miniseries it shame westerns like this few far ... westerns such great format showing our country its heritage . frankly , lonesome dove it americana . character interaction duvall jones makes this film masterpiece it . viewers , we drawn into lives two lifelong fiends entering twilight years their lives . former rangers , they tamed sw border territory together . then disillusioned , spent their best years personal purgatory lonesome dove ... where their only source amusement getting drunk , getting laid town only prostitute or stealing horses across border . feats valor forgotten , their self-respect diminished , they realize life opportunity passed them bye . both become determined confront death one last time . what occurs this film keen examination love two aging men , both agreeing make cattle drive montana setup ranch ..... perilous feat worth recapturing their youth self respect .... but reality , journey which they both hope not return . many us follow same path , friendships so old close one cannot easily discards one obligation other . this common thread rivets us screen . we brought into relationship call mccrea garner what meaning friendship two men who known each other so long . i cannot think any film adequately exposed this quality among men so well except lonesome dove	1

i saw this twice during its too brief(one week ! )run seattle 1987 i always showing it people later video who thought i insane , which may or may not beside point , but this one those movies , like big trouble little china , inform you someones personal sense humor taste . either you get it or you don't . i think this movie some kind psychopathic classic perfectly sends up extreme amorality spaghetti westerns prefigures homicidal men black suits later turn up pulp fiction reservoir dogs . few films top it sheer nihilistic rip-it-apart glee . i am glad it finally seen dvd its original aspect ratio , because theaters it very carefully staged widescreen compositions which lost video . cast uniformly weird wonderful : sy richardson , channeling pure self-righteous macho bad-ass blackness , joe strummer , showing surprisingly light touch comedy , dick rude , hilariously channeling psycho-punk james cagney , courtney love ( hang there , girl ! )gives truly committed performance shrill whining nancy spungen monster , pogues almost manage say their dialog , elvis costello doesn't much dialog but acquits himself well . i could go rest cast , there plenty them still mention , including especially miguel sandover , who greatest clint eastwood send-up i ever pleasure watching . watch this film ... you'll either get it ... or you won't . i laughed like hell .	1

one thing i always liked series murderous culprits always " uber-successful " much lose not committing crime . course , statement not my endorsement murder means end ; it just cool see those people we think " it all " resort doing away their fellow man ( or woman ) . this third season dvd compilation shares same double-sided disc format previous second season collection . unfortunately , it includes installment kate mulgrew lamentable " mrs. columbo . " though show came after these " columbo " episodes , it looks more dated , filming techniques , well awful scoring writing . fortunately , actress , she would achieve greater success " captain janeway " " star trek : voyager . " " columbo " episodes , other hand , some best show entire run . vera miles , actress i long admired , gets glamorously chew scenery likes vincent price young martin sheen wickedly delicious " lovely but lethal " . film veteran donald pleasance hams it up marvelously snooty winemaker " liquidates " his younger half-brother ( gary conway " land giants " ) cleverly titled " any old port storm " . this episode also features vito scotti , friend star peter falk appeared many " columbo " over years , including " swan song " , also among this compilation . " candidate crime " former child star jackie cooper plays politician saddled less-than-desirable campaign manager decides put permanent end their political relationship . robert culp , one television best actors , returns third time perpetrator " double exposure , " also featuring robert middleton louise latham . oscar winner jose ferrer stars possibly " weakest " episodes , " mind over mayhem , " though it features sly tribute steven spielberg , director first episode show . also , guest star roster includes screen veteran lew ayres ( theatrical " dr. kildare " series ) young jessica walter ( " arrested development " ) . but most ingenious use guest stars writing belong " publish or perish , " previously mentioned " swan song , " " friend deed " . jack cassidy , fine actor appeared several episodes , first , again playing someone publishing field , he spielberg-directed " murder book . " " swan song " stars underrated actor johnny cash country gospel singer . film star television directing legend ida lupino plays his shrewish wife . finally , broadway veteran richard kiley gets most inspired role all , playing columbo police commissioner boss murders his wife . composer billy goldenberg would provide most brilliant scores third season . this stellar season , marred universal decision include " mrs. columbo " failure offer any other extras dvd buyers come expect	1
comedy ? thriller ? suspense ? i guess these all words or genres you could use describe this film . i would use these words if i wanted gloss over true feeling this film . i would use these words if i sell this wallow-some film distributor who didn't know any better . i would use these words lightly , because if i ever believed them battle would forever lost . this not comedy . it not thriller . it definitely not suspense . so , what it ? after viewing this film i came conclusion january man reminded me puzzle put together two-year-old . while all pieces box put together , sadly infant size brain child chose smash pieces together instead place them corresponding orders . thus , you jumbled mess wedged pieces what could overall beautiful picture . poor acting , confusing plot literally went nowhere ending felt forced premature , one see this puzzle unfixable even best puzzler world . if i those involved creation , i would definitely ashamed . begin , what wrong actors ? nobody seemed like they giving 10% much less 50% their effort this film . even great ones like keitel , kline , sarandon felt like they walking through motions equally confused eyes hearts . kline new york accent faded out throughout film giving us no glimpse his actual character . his role never fully defined , so other half time we watch him screen we just don't care him all . this one worst leading characters all time . thankfully , completely miscast team seemed more interested money than actually " acting " backs him up . keitel horrible this film . i am huge fan his body work , but this one he walked , talked , gave those emotionless eyes rest . he provided nothing value this production . same said sarandon , whose character seemed unfocused undervalued , mary elizabeth mastrantonio , who never really got her feet wet hollywood until maid marion arrived her doorstep . alan rickman wasted , well one-leveled voices danny aiello rod steiger whose only direction pat o'conner yell . other words , if you interested seeing this film acting , you greatly disappointed . second , perhaps acting overlooked strong story line ? wrong ! this most convoluted script i ever seen hollywood produce . we spend first forty minutes learning event happened two years ago never fully explained anyway . it reminded those times teacher would say class we should all listen up because this wasn't going test . then why bother . this set spiraling downfall rest film . this unavailable information also lead some pretty choppy chemistry actors . i never say kline keitel brothers . i never saw relationship sarandon possible . fact , now i think it , i didn't see any actors meshing well together because they working script focused all wrong parts . eventually , january man gets so caught up this secondary story we find ourselves rushed into ending solution seems laughable instead plausible . we even villain so confusing i don't even think he knew what he doing film . final thirty minutes this film worst parts this movie , second all parts before . whoever wrote this script must just forgotten basic rules storytelling because nothing meshed well all . finally , i would comment marketing this film could feel like cheated ticket some filmgoers . after reading some reviews this film , i expecting find myself chuckling out loud antics kevin kline his spin world investigation . i wrong . there no humor this film all . even when o'conner tried bring some , it seemed forced unhealthy . i must repeat , this not comedy . it even isn't really suspenseful , nor thrilling aspect actually thrilling . i must admit whomever sold this film company under guise it comedy should awarded " best salesman decade " award . somebody believed this film funny even pasted preview it word " comedy " written all over it . someone sold company broken product ... hook , line , sinker . i just ask you beware . overall , this film horrible . poor acting , cryptic story needed some form decoder ring understand , passionless actors , harshly branded word " comedy " , january man proves not all films should made advanced screen process should used regularly . i genuinely encourage you skip this film . no good come you watching this mess . i promise . grade : * out ****	-1
" koma " surprisingly suspenseful film . while there enough gore certainly warrant horror flick categorization , director chi-leung law delivers very old school hitchcock suspense tale . close-ups objects like foot dragging across floor leaving bloodstained trail heighten suspense move story . angelica lee fung chi-ching , girl who needs new kidney inhibitions keep her fully embracing her boyfriend , good job hits many levels hysteria jealousy drunken delirium . andy hui who plays her boyfriend , dr. tsui wai-man , hits number levels also guy love man whose hormones outpace his common sense . researcher suen ling , karena lam projects person who difficult upbringing frequently not walks shady side street . twists plot trace kidney thief who black-markets organs $ 60,000 pop never leaves you quite settled until final frame . subtitled chinese dialog often sparsely verbal picture translates well international audience . " koma " turns out pleasant , often intelligent , surprise . enjoy !	1

i looked name ( groovaloos ) i looked cover -- my gut told me not get this dvd . i went against my gut believed reviews ; i wish i'd listened my gut . those you who think it looks sounds little hokey , you're right money . they all dance , but compared what i expected , they seemed mediocre . here lowdown : ( 1 ) sound sucks - they're city park you hear instructions fine , but music isn't loud enough really " feel " something makes you want move , ( 2 ) they just seem like group people who don't naturally rhythm , but they've learned some moves ; it so not inspiring , ( 3 ) it not edgy enough , ( 4 ) it looks good if you've got group doing it , but when someone doing it alone , it just okay . overall , this dvd okay , but not great . get it only if you're truly desperate	-1

" i right what i earned , " paraphrase ) . businessman , however , moves arguing his captors sympathizing them , explaining he once radical himself . this real or merely ploy gain their trust ? romantic triangle further escalates tension . i liked intellectual content edukators ; it reminds us how few films today deal sympathetically characters who not only outside system , but actively oppose it . even better , movie not simply romanticize radicals demonize businessman . it actually raises more questions than it answers , which probably good thing . it not perfect film ; some situations seem bit contrived ( e.g. one them expert deactivating burglar alarms because he used work security company ) . ending more clever punchline than serious resolution matters . still , it very engaging well-acted puts new face old dilemma participating vs . fighting mainstream society .	1

flower life span nothing compared humans , yet flowers go through similar developmental stages . most memorable part flower growth blossoming progress where it goes small bud until it dwindles ground rapid withering phase . occasionally , love uses life span flower symbol affectionate spell under which two individuals bond . when flower withers , relationship turns numb , which case ferdinando " fef " cefal ( marcello mastroianni ) . fef merely stays his wife rosalia ( daniela rocca ) , societal restrictions enforced catholic church , family , public , which forces people remain married until death they part . light this notion , audience truly experience socially important comedy , which plays ideas divorce through more hideous plots such murder , deceit , other troublemaking . film opens moving train fef exits public toilet while he bumps into two sicilian police officers . quickly fef leaves them behind , he slowly makes his way through gentle zigzagging around other passengers dining car . seated while ordering roast beef two potatoes , fef continues gaze upon passing sicilian countryside , which not seem changed much since roman empire . this familiar place fef who begins disclose amusing tale why he his way home , he recollects homesick manner his hometown agramonte . this opening several suggestive nods towards fef character , his family what important agramonte , which comically profoundly illustrated story unfolds . introduction fef audience learns through his words , camera , actions characters societal progress not seem high agenda . instead audience learns how politics catholic church seem intertwined this small town . slow progress generated some very rigid guidelines , which no one seems willing challenge . this societal stalemate men only seem pay attention gossip one thing - women . this essential information , it depicts boredom helps withering flowers . story goes into great detail depict fef monotonous life . he unemployed due social status because he baron , which means he often sleeps . whenever he not sleep his exceedingly caring nurturing rosalia tends his needs while it actually seems if she only annoying him . there wonderful scene where fef escapes everyone read peace enjoy soothing breeze small fan his study while rosalia enters coffee turns off fan . fef turns fan again while rosalia turns it off smile , she serves him coffee . this scene oozes tension two while fef keeps his cool rosalia tries her best good wife . yet , it offers him opportunity begin imagine different methods how he could kill her . fef annoyance boredom he discovers stunning teen angela ( stefania sandrelli ) whom infatuates him brief look mass . fef begins think angela while he sneaks bathroom steal peak youthful girl through window . eventually , angela expresses her mutual desire fef , but they careful so they not cause scandal , or worse . this provides opportunity fef begin actually think how get rid off rosalia , which turns out comically ugly event he cannot divorce her law . audience feel empathy rosalia who tries good wife , but fef not allow it distant . simultaneously , one cannot help feel understanding fef who now begins study law how he possibly could get away murder . it sad thought , even though presentation topic jovial , people ready commit worst possible act name love . yet , it also here where film strength lays , it delivers funny depiction how pass society squelch life frown upon societal progress , which big deal 1960s . notion arises regards progress -- should one freedom find their own blossoming flower ? divorce italian style offers well-written genuine comedy deliberate intentions audience ponder regarding society social restrictions govern unhappy . cast marvelous job portraying different characters . example , daniela rocca illustration rosalia provides authentic view woman who seeks love form her husband , but not receive it . addition , marcello mastroianni brilliant job through his dual performance film also fellini la dolce vita , which shown film . however , mastroianni visual persona suggests his infatuation beautiful women explored if one views la dolce vita . lastly , camera work , mise-en-scene , framing each scene enhance complete ideas , they transcends expectations film	1
" joy luck club , " my opinion close perfect movie i ever seen . i would not hesitate give it ten stars out possible ten . mostly chinese american cast absolutely superb their performances . my favorite character june , daughter suyuan . beginning movie , her friends family gathered together before she go china meet two sisters she not realize she until after her mother died . movie centers around four chinese women their daughters . experiences women china , apparently two world wars , often filled sorrow suffering . their stories told chinese english subtitles . experiences women china young girls young women strongly influenced how each them raised their daughters united states . i only couple quibbles this otherwise outstanding movie . one women , young females china during 1930 , occasionally unusually bold asserting themselves men who oppress them . while , feminist very strong believer completely equal rights based gender , i generally applaud most their actions , it not seem historically realistic given unfortunate pervasive second class citizenship chinese women during time period . " joy luck " great film all respects , peformances actresses , general storyline , cinematography music . this movie i watch over again , enjoying very much each occasion . ending this movie when june meets her two sisters , apparently shanghai , great scene very moving , one best endings any movie i ever seen .	1
i never fan boston celtics . i respected them , sure , but i could never see myself rooting them . all changed when i first bought nba video entitled " larry bird , basketball legend " way back 1991 . i just bought magic johnson one , wanted see his greatest rival . while i am slightly disappointed flow story am somewhat uncomfortable monotonous narration daniel stern ( hence 4 star rating ) , i safely say video what i not think possible : turn me into larry bird fan . then . fast forward recent history . when i saw amazon lbabl re-issued dvd form , i jumped chance get it . course , it helped lot classic larry games included ! pros : nice game selection . video itself moving . cons : where game 5 1991 eastern first round against indiana ? i think no game defined larry more than one . also , remember comments i made earlier ..	1
brood lightning bottle director david cronenberg never able duplicate . while all his films definitely his fingerprints all over them , brood managed rise top all his films . it absolutely dripping sense dispair dread . there pervading coldness it - such you want wrap up something warm you watch it - you want watch it lights because you're very much afraid what might there if you turn off lights . film psychological thriller wrapped slasher flick . it warrants slasher status simply because sheer number onscreen murders take place . this very bloody film ! samantha eggar nuts weird clinic people like her . she treated creepy oliver reed ( one his better performances ) . art hindle her ex husband he worried how she treating their young daughter . after while least his worries , these horribly disfigured ( what hell they ? ) bizarre little children run around killing all people really ticked off samantha eggar . i won't say more , because part horror cronenberg film pseudo-science he get you believe . whereas cronenberg videodrome weird , but not terribly good , brood one creepiest films i've ever seen guilty pleasure ( i really call it ? ) i choose subject myself every so often . really ! what those things ?	1

i saw this show live when it taped boston , i honestly say dane cook never ceases amaze me . it easy categorize his act simply catering towards obnoxious frat boys , but dane cook brought life back comedy his unique approach brilliant use words . not mention his delivery always spot . i grown tired typical simplistic humor sort become norm snl other " comedy " shows . but dane cook performances refreshing watch because he makes act what it ; only he could perform his act pull it off without looking like he trying too hard . he simply amazing comedian there reason why he named one time top 100 most influential people also one forbes ' top 100 celebrities . this dvd definitely worth buy . he uses his classic material previously released cd ( which never loses its hilariousness ) , but he also busts out lot new stuff just good , if not better . so buy dvd , see it theaters 11/27/06 if you , prepare yourself non-stop laughs . support guy because he awesome he adores his fans ! sufi !!	1
call me crazy ( most , anyway ) , but i absolutely adore this series . first your classic adventure flick , course , all romance , action comedy entails . second , my personal favorite , delves much further into story cranks up character development practically every major character ( i even cried imhotep one point . yeah ... you don't want get me started subject ) . since i'm such sucker sort thing , you bet i captivated . scorpion king , while not exactly mind-blowing , cool backstory previously sketchy character pure actiony fun . plus , mathayus kicks butt high style . :d box set itself really quite durable , though it might not look it first glance . interesting choice , making it out cardboard like , but it works nicely . extras such , i love running through these . fascinated ancient country early childhood , egyptology lessons nothing i didn't already know , but they make me grin all same . all all , there some lovely goodies this set , especially music videos tmr sk . mind you , i already own lot them vhs ( despite fact they're state my grandmother while i'm college ) , but we all know what happens those things after so many viewings . so yeah , i didn't think getting one my favorite series price one new release such bad thing . ps : guys , particularly brendan oded , great eye candy . rock arnold add their own flavor " hot , " too , which nothing complain this female . purely superficial thought , i know , not something i generally pay too much attention ... but frankly , it true	1
i sceptic most before seeing this movie . personally , i would rather watched funny flick . but once i saw first monster it started rocking my socks . plot line stray away but yet not too far original computer game . i would say this movie " based " game doom but not reenactment . most people probably expecting movie rekindle old memories computer game . one part movie makes you think actually game . but overall heads up , you disappointed . me i loved this movie just because action fight scenes . it really thrilled me . if you really don't care see game based movie least watch this one it sheer action . also , it makes you kind think ... would you turn into monster if you movie ? would you kill innocent people infected even if they could saved ? hahaha movie makes you think it cool aspect ! =p extras dvd aren't half bad either if you get two disc edition .	1

i never seen mr. show hbo before i got dvds they came out . like previous seasons , this one mix good bad stuff , lot more good than bad . there tight , smart pieces like prenatal beauty pageant life-raft talk show , but then there dragging , corny sketches like " date queen " . it evident commentary even bob , david , rest cast feel there some real clunkers just didn't work . other hand , bob often critical sketches work just fine , so maybe he just crack . there nice expansion cast this season . tom kenny doesn't show up much , but b.j. porter scott aukerman some hilarious roles . jay johnston also more prominent , he always funny . if you liked previous three seasons , this definitely worth picking up . writing , performing , production values best all mr. show seasons	1

i wonder if it says anything significant me i waited 10 years see this particular blockbuster . i mean , i always figured i'd get around this film some point , so i'm not total cinema snob distainer all things commercial . those clips white house getting zapped pretty attention grabbing back when i first saw previews back day . or just seeing those megalith space ships hovering over every major city world pretty darn ominous . so deep down , i always wanted check it out . but i guess i just never much rush . now critical analysis sorta my game , amazon reviewer notes above , independence day mostly pure fun movie -- not one many people going subject intense critical scrutiny . so why bother review it all ? this point , it available so many different formats probably all most consumers want know which right one them their player . they already know whether they want purchase it or not . reviewing film film may virtually pointless when most consumers likely only looking product review this point . well , what i say ? i'm critical analysis kind guy , so i really can't tell you merits digipak over double or single disk anniversary versions . tell you truth , i watched thing plain ol ' vhs -- i picked up sale , no less . but i still liked it , even without all dvd bells whistles . , yes , visuals stunning even this antiquated format . but just apercu or two . watching any film which iconic american buildings get zapped sky no longer innocent escapism it 1995 . i even winced seeing twin towers standing tall ( unharmed ) some early , pre-catastrophe scenes . we watch such things more jaded eye these days . or it more horrified stare ? escapist fare usually centered around big " what if . " these days , we pretty much know " what if . " before seeing this movie , i always wondered how well bill pullman ( actor i genuinely like ) would pull off presidential . he little too young ? little too callow ? cleverly enough , screenwriters made him struggling , almost failing commander chief , whose prior life hero pilot first gulf war may gotten him electec but left him ill prepared hardball politics . he presidential youthful john . kennedy/bill clinton kind way . unlike them , however , he not much political pro all . but also unlike kennedy , he still young able enough enter into actual battle once again himself -- ( many would opine)unlike clinton , he guts so . that something blockbuster films like play , isn't it -- our almost innate , primitive desire our leaders actual heroes ? course , we're just ( post-)modern enough want those heroes little bit flawed , say nothing bit conflicted . pullman all more . but there never any doubt he won't pull off his counter-offensive . he got cute newly motherless little tyke ( one who later showed up chicago hope ) take care , so he cannot allow himself fail . neither crazy crop-dusting pilot randy quaid , whose very family pretty much written him off loco loser . somehow quaid able inject some humanity some wit into his stock loser-who's-gonna-show-'em role . but still , there times when you find yourself mouthing his lines him wondering just how he pulled this off straight face . which you could also say rest cast well . these mostly very good , widely respected actors their work cut out them if they want move their characters all beyond level stereotype . funny thing , most them . mary mcdonnell suffers dies admirably . margaret colin stunning sassy presidential aide . her performance good enough you wonder why she never became " then next big thing " after all , i say this utter conviction , even though i must admit same time , i still keep mixing her up elizabeth perkins . face almost certain annihilation , she decides put aside her feud ( still devoted ) ex-hubby jeff goldblum . good thing too , since it goldblum character who figured out alien invaders weak spot . now all he needs ear president ... but how ? but how ? wait minute , i know ...! ok , so it bit cliched . but tongue cheek way , you understand . beauty latter-day sci-fi flicks their dazzling special effects so overwhelming you really don't want bothered much else . independence day , like so many other s-f films , wants come across 50s flick killer effects enough sly self-awareness so not appear hopelessly cornball . yeah , it just cornball enough . yeah , danged if it doesn't all work somehow .	1

they say you either love or hate this rather bizarre offering 1983 , but i found myself somewhat indifferent videodrome approached its conclusion . my mind , final third story ultimately too haphazard , esoteric , too consciously horror-driven clearly express themes worked into heart film . it easy read lot into this film , but that much credit viewer it filmmakers . still , videodrome certainly fascinating , unique film compels viewer contrast interplay video real life our increasingly technological age . 1983 , most people already seeing life through television screen - tv defined news , fashion , latest fads , etc . movie , tv plays integral part food comfort rehabilitation homeless taken cathode ray mission run dr. o'blivion ( jack creley ) . rather than paint television soul-draining maker brain-dead zombies , videodrome forges its way down even more frightening path , where television used potential weapon masses . james woods plays max renn , rather sleazy cable operator who depends shocking television shows keep his little station up running . he discovers many his shows through satellite piracy , just how videodrome first comes his attention . he fascinated show , which features nothing but torture abuse individuals , especially women , no sign plot anywhere behind it . it just kind shocking new thing he after , so he begins searching its source . his prurient interest such violent material enhanced his current girlfriend , nicki brand ( deborah harry ) , who so into sm she vows audition videodrome herself . before long , max begins hallucinating , his efforts discover source videodrome become , same time , desperate attempt maintain his sanity if not physical life . show isn't rotting his brain , but it physically changing it , therein lies unheralded danger this example reality tv taken extreme . all this works beautifully first hour , but i just feel psychology story ultimately sacrificed name horror , special effects force something disconnect viewer film . least my case , this robbed this otherwise perversely fascinating film much its power	1

" what monumental waste time this -- so unrealistically sentimental make one wince times . use near amateurs minor roles not help . this story ( such it ) retired teacher whose former students ( who all happen live nearby , apparently ) remain devoted him , sort christ-and-his-disciples relationship . they visit frequently , build him new home after war , hold lavish birthday parties him ( spend 30 minutes screen time helping him look his lost cat ) . what makes these students so devoted never explored all -- kurosawa just expects us take it fact . this leads painful conclusion " madadayo " depicts kurosawa idealization himself : kind old man inspiring continuing devotion his former proteges . " madadayo " also explains why beat takeshi others new generation talented japanese filmmakers become so disgusted kurosawa toward end his career . -- mellowmonk.co	-1

i intending see this documentary pretty much time it first came out until recently when i finally see it . i both pleased surprised it completely restricted itself analysis images appeared onscreen disappointed end not much really said any depth . so , i odd state relieved it not bad film like it chance ( delving into speculations sex lives famous hollywood personalities ) but it wasn't quite good i hope it would . i wondered beforehand if film would cover such topics frequent speculation cary grant randolph scott ( which there amazingly little evidence ; basis their lovers seems rest almost exclusively their roomed together many years ); rivalries cole porter set hollywood noel coward set ; efforts hide bi- , homo- , or pansexuality actors such errol flynn , robert taylor , laurence olivier , danny kaye , tyrone power ( all whom fact one three ); or proclivities various actresses . fact , there astonishingly little comment sexual orientations various people hollywood . instead , entire film deals almost exclusively images screen only screen . this , however , turns out far more interesting than voyeuristic plumbing sex lives stars . movie buff i , course , seen number obviously gay characters movies . joel cairo maltese falcon merely one better known . documentary its finest when it unearths many gay lesbian images films twenties , thirties , forties , fifties , decades which self-censorship limited what could shown movies . some these images familiar anyone who seen many films , such mrs. danvers rebecca ( those it should pointed out even it movie tremendously mutes lesbianism far more blatant novel ) . many others far less familiar . number scenes unmistakable homosexual scenes , i believe , surprise most people who seen lot movies . most interesting moment may when gore vidal admits he william wyler decided ben-hur messala lovers . stephen boyd informed this he acted his half relationship this mind , while wyler vidal decided not tell rather conservative heston any this . end , limiting discussion homosexuality images screen somewhat limited scope documentary . i'm not quite sure what ultimate point they trying make , unless it somewhat trivial one gays treated negatively movies , though improved somewhat recent years . not knowing what their ultimate goal film , i can't say whether they achieved it . still , despite ambiguity heart film what they trying accomplish , this remains very interesting film . it narrated lily tomlin . time its first presentation hbo story widely circulated she informally agreed come out closet time film first shown . last minute she seems change heart . she remains this day most poorly closeted person united states . me this points perhaps even more interesting story : way actors actresses directors stayed closeted over decades . every rupert everett ian mckellan there forty actors stay closeted . ongoing struggle maintaining public image while living very different life privately one i find fascinating . all all , this very good documentary . i definitely recommend it	1

i generally like some these french-comic-books-turned-into-movies because they're usually pretty erotic . jane fonda role barbarella comes mind . this gwendoline series definitely potential what scantily-clad women-in-bondage theme scenes involving gwendoline her dominant girlfriend . but very beautiful tawney kitaen ( cast gwendoline ) apparently balked doing girl/girl scenes ( this 1984 , after all ) , so producers obligingly didn't force her any , result this one turned into very bland , weak , diluted version raiders lost ark . it not good adventure film , it certainly not erotic . there little nudity , some ridiculous moments supposed capture kinkiness french comics , but overall this one disappointing bust .	-1

i just watched this movie last night . i came across title someone myspace jared leto fan i wanted watch it . i also read few reviews talked some people who said film riveting . riveting very least i say this film . it amazon editorial review puts it , " tour through hell . " this film makes you think . fact all addicts succumbed their addictions seems little out there me but i keep wondering it so far fetched . . . ? how many people there actually escape addictions ? you might escape one but more than likely you soon replace it . during film i kept trying see positive side it all hoping there some middle ground ; some little piece hope left . i wrong . film didn't depict drug use way i expected see it ; way i seen it depicted countless other films . all ugly aspects drug use put out there your viewing pleasure . personally i found it painful watch . there moments when i actually thought turning it off but some reason continued watch . i think reason hypnotic trancelike style film . truth i couldn't stop watching . film put me directly shoes addict . i felt like addicts film . . . my hands sweaty my heart pounding . i couldn't close my eyes . i want see it again sometime . i would like watch it my husband . i bought movie before i ever watched it first time . film painfully realistic , genuinely graphic , appalling appealing same exact time . must see . overall i think it wonderful film add any collection . personally it probably one best movies i ever watched . i think acting movie outstanding , direction genius , plot amazingly horrific . all all this 5 star film	1

it very difficult review this dvd give it correct stars . if you consider 2d version , it would get 4 or 5 stars animation colors wonderful very humorous story . but 3d version terrible . 3d worst ever , it never really produces 3d effect red/blue glasses dull changes colors making it almost black white film . none 3d effects really work . best them falling snow . often viewer sees two images ruining whole effect making it impossible concentrate story . recommendation forget 3d version just play 2d version . both disk . when 3d first introduced , people complained they got headaches 3d . this dvd definitely falls into catagory . perhaps imax gray poloroid glasses , effects work . not this disk	-1

this dvd first season now-classic simpsons animated series , collects show first thirteen episodes . not much really needs said simpsons , it one biggest pop culture icons ever . however , you really tell these episodes series rough around edges when it started . character designs unrefined , animation crude rubbery . stories feel like typical sitcom plots little simpsons edginess zany humour tossed , but not nearly enough it . voice-actors also still getting into character here , so their performances also different what they later matured into . luckily , fox loaded first season dvd goodies , including commentaries every episode some other fun retrospective material . presentation really nice too some original packaging disc artwork . i'd say episodes themselves three stars , but superb box set treatment bumps overall score up four . if you're casual simpsons fan , season 2 much better place start watching , thats when memorable episodes really start coming . but hardcores , this set great buy , nice start your collection .	1

i can't possibly put into words how great war movie this , but it touched me deep inside . me , there little greater honor than serve one country , especially time unpopular war . i felt his film portrayed desire world warriors answer call duty honorable men , regardless side you fighting . perhaps one my favorite things this movie . albeit small part , time given " other " side we allowed glimpse enemy warriors . end , lt . col . moore paid homage , sense , enemy he fought . , course , actual footage moore shown extras ( bonuses must see ! ) praising his men -- nearly weeping he so . time when only reason people join service college money , servicemen scramble get out service when war comes , this movie reminds us we should much more grateful few serve dignity it because they americans love their country enough answer call when it comes . without these honorable warriors , there would no america	1

whatever ills world , it all fault corporations . that basic premise this terribly misguided one-sided totally non-objective movie . example , instead saying how terrible it companies paying people developing world peanuts their work , they forget these people alternatives even worse that why they took job first place ! these jobs provide them one few options they , if they chose job freely , it must their best option , no matter how crazy it seems us . people skills rise , opportunities increase over time ( more corporations not less , create more competition these people labor ) , country becomes wealthier , these people wages rise automaticaly fact , wages whole country average . there no shortcuts his . famous story comes nepal where anti-child labor laws , urging un , turned thousands kids overnight into prostitutes those jobs , sad it may , their best options avoid starvation feed their families . it slow process , but all industrialized nations went through process . government-mandated " shortcuts " usually produce results which even worse . however , results speak themselves : very short period time , example , hundrds millions people lifted out poverty china , india around world thanks " evil " capalism its corporations . no other system ever it so quickly past 15 years china india alone . also , cost living very low there , so these pennies really go long way , don't measure it cost living west . what filmmakers alternative they offer these people ? i guess let people starve death , then makers this movie don't anyting complain !? other examples stupidity include showing company like person who psychopath . corpoartion legal entity yes , may act like separate " " far law concerned , but corporation nose , feet , stomach ? it eat apples or sneeze or arthritis ? course , not , than how you attach human idea like psychopath it ?? several main " spokepersons " movie , chomsky , michael moore , rifkin others renowned their off-the-wall comments which frequently no basis any kind economics or reality . correct inaccuracies statements made these other people movie , you'd stop it every 5 minutes explain audience how profoundly wrong statements . throughout whole movie , you're basically bombarded one-sided arguments very little other side presented , despite director claim opposite 9they claim 1/2 1/2 , it more like 80%-20%) . just look chomsky comments how consumers so stupid , they don't realize all things they buy they don't really need . i mean we don't need fashionable clothes ( hey , let all dress boring chomsky ! ) , dvd players , or any new gadgets make life easier or more fun . who judge what you really need ? chomsky , course . he final arbiter what you really need or what you don't . you're too stupid know what you want , according him . he says you should " more important things " , like ... perhaps studying lingistics ( which he teaches but which very few care ) . movie make some correct good observations , especially regarding polution , however , i'd say 80% movie factually logically flawed . it also full economic fallacies . it worth watching i guess , just see how many errors one make just 1 movie . despite all ranting movie , it fails mention biggest reason most problems it brings up - too much governement interference every facet life . examples , how could government brazil forbit people collecting rain water ! how could u.s. government so many things private companies public funds ? just forbid governments playing favorites companies , forbid government corporate welfare any kind , forbid subsidies companies , cut suffocating red tape regulation ( esp . developing countries but west too ) , cut corporate taxes 5 or 10% ( see unemployment rate go almost nothing , give people all around world better life , increase competition , etc . ) if these other governments ( not corporations ' ) problems eliminated , vast majority all problems which movie brings up simply go away . interesing film anyone see how truth twisted mindless people agenda go back 15th century rural lifestile ( spoken much admiration ) , people no understanding economics , how world really works how really raise billions out poverty who this movie biggest disservice .	-1
worst movie ever made . i actually sat through whole thing hoping it would get better . acting beyond awful , story joke . i honestly blown away how terrible it , not waste your money or time this movie	-1

you'll get over it great film . film boy named vincent who everything going him riding smoothly . he great swimmer well school , people like him . vincent girlfriend noemie who very good him best pal stephane who also swim team . vincent however secretly dating bruno ( older man ) make excuses see bruno . while hanging out hallway his friends , vincent eye catches benjamin , new student . two lock eyes next time they cross paths again when vincent working . however , other people vincent swim team know benjamin gay they tell him stay away vincent . next day vincent outed graffiti school wall . film then vincent trying cope growing up now everyone school knows he gay . he come forth his girlfriend , his best friend , his family . i think story line extremely believable . it almost if you forget its movie if your looking into someone else life . it so powerful see what vincent going through new struggles he faces . julien baumgartner such good actor , he delivers great performance . he very intune character he playing able make vincent so dynamic so many emotions feelings . rest cast also good , roles they play vital film . i just can't tell you words how much i liked this film . i don't know if it because it french film . it definately artistic side you may not see so much american films . i also didn't mind reading subtitles , but rather enjoyed them . this film probably one best gay films i seen . i strongly think if you watch this you like it	1

i saw charlie chocolate factory last night first time ( i'm behind times , yes ) though i usually don't care very much giving my opinion , journey tim burton his team made me cross deserves homage . especially all criticism rising around film before it released . i tim burton fan more than decade now ; i grew up his films . but what i through yesterday his really unique . i actually never thought he would offer us such film one day . fans his first period , all lonely desperate characters won't like it sure . since mars attacks !, more specifically since big fish , burton decided tell things differently . his vision world slightly changed every his films : now , rejected freak comes down world stays . world remains frightening weird even thought we call it " reality " but world worth living . that what charlie chocolate factory all ... it all begins main title sequence may one main weaknesses film . sequence very entertaining visually ambitious but they decided go cgi it looks like it decision they made last minute . since film proudly made " real " sets , " real " oompas loompas , " real " squirrels , main title looks inappropriate . it not important but it tim burton film we know how much he usually works his main title . hopefully , danny elfman there crazy mix edward scissorhands spider-man ( music when title film appears gave me shivers ) , true musical roller-coaster gives hint what his score sound like through film . after , it just emotions . all kinds them : laughs ( many - audience laughed almost every thirty seconds ) , tears joy ( we all know charlie gonna find ticket but when he , you just can't refrain your heart beat faster ) , mercy ( way burton depicts social misery bucket family really touching ) , amazement ( wonka factory its many rooms true wonder , one most achieved design burton ever offered us ) many mores . very much like book , even though it seems simple childish , you would like stop second collect those feelings try analyze them but you don't time . it just never stops ( i realize it might flaw some people fact ) . burton never so generous terms human warmness . johnny depp proposes inventive completely wacky interpretation here . i won't compare gene wilder since i don't know first film very well ( pretty unknown flick here europe ) those comparisons should stop anyway . depp makes wonka tormented unadapted character who doesn't know much common courtesy doesn't really care anyway . he built up his own universe response his authoritarian father he pretty proud it . he just doesn't want those " weird " ( word he likes - you've all seen tv spots ) boring parents their despicable children ruin what life based . yet ... so depp wonka actually very moving pathetic his attempts entertain his visitors . burton everything he make you hate augustus , vercua , violet mike moment you first see them , you get instantly closer wonka when you noticed he feels same . addition , john august vision wonka past ( including always perfect cameo christopher lee ) offers character real depth you didn't expect . danny elfman also one main attractions film . while his score already classic burton/elfman work some interesting experiments ( main themes splendid ) , songs he wrote oompas loompas just so funny . hugh laughs audience some musical choices . those songs don't intend stay you months ( it would hard they're based dahl lyrics doesn't allow broadway impulses ) , they're just off-beat numbers playing many references so many styles . oingo boingo fans buy soundtrack when it'll come out , it'll bring them back 15 years ago . what , i tell you more ? mcdowell sets amazing , pescucci work impressive well rousselot beautiful cinematography . some oscar nominations should fall here . ending , without revealing it , august additions really touching fit perfectly burton new approach . even though final shot tempers " family " theme he developed through film ( it still burton , not disney ) , burton makes you feel good because he feels good ( what i'm writing here ring bell when you'll see movie ) . i don't know you but after so many distressed pessimistic films , it really moved see he found certain peace . charlie chocolate factory step forward direction he gave his career big fish . he lost his father , he became one , he getting older all those questions doubts expressed many important very complex images scenes he imagined film . that why i could call this film " edward scissorhands " his new period . those films very different but gave me both some very essential emotions . thank you , tim burton . thank you very much	1

this movie put josh hartnett acting map me . his earlier works easy enough avoid consider yourself lucky if you've able so . i hope this transition his part into better roles ; he entertaining . his quick-witted quips keep you laughing help you avoid need wonder what earth going movie . they fill you due time , even though i wouldn't surprised if you figure out ending before it unfolds ; you wouldn't first . it seemed little silly morgan freeman ben kingsley roles such these since they relatively small roles . but they definitely added big names draw attention movie more people should see . i feel like i should more say this movie , but i really sum it up saying i thoroughly enjoyed lucky # slevin .	1
no matter how old i get , i'll never too old enjoy good teen movie . yes , it rather formulaic , but 10 things i hate you smart funny more intelligent than your average teen comedy . it also stars julia styles , which definite plus my book . i can't say my high school anything like padua high ( how many high schools take place huge castle ? ) , i certainly never english teacher like one teaching here , but every high school pretty much same when it comes cliques , romances , misunderstandings , sibling rivalries , like . one things i really liked this film fact it didn't break down according overused formula rich kids vs . poor kids never twain shall meet ( unless you're , say , molly ringwald ) . it true this film loosely inspired shakespeare taming shrew , but don't make too much . how many teens would even know what shrew ? personally , i don't look kat stratford ( julia styles ) shrew ; she just bitter , disillusioned teen who can't stand thought doing what expected her - she reasons taking this persona . her sister bianca ( larisa oleynik ) her exact opposite , vivacious girl who just wants normal teenager . her problem girls ' overprotective father , who refuses let bianca date until kat starts dating ( which doesn't look like it happening any time soon given kat nature ) . new kid school , cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) , smitten bianca , he puts together plan make her date-eligible someone else take out her sister - ingeniously using school pitifully shallow cool guy ( bianca admirer ) middle man . chosen one school mysterious new tough guy , who earn money he paid win reluctant kat over . obviously , he ends up falling girl , which puts everything place predictable conclusion . kat designated dater become couple , or everything explode guy face ? bianca ever win right get out house spread her perkiness all around ? who bianca choose - hot , brainless mr. cool or cameron , nice boy who looks like he should still junior high ? , since she already taller than guy , bianca ever stop putting her hair up when she goes out him ? clichs abound , but script really rather witty . those keeping score home , film feature one wild dance party required minimum one barfing scene , but it never crosses line into completely dumb teen comedy . 10 things i hate you isn't quite good classic john hughes films 1980s , but it easily better than most teen films produced recent years . its pg-13 rating , it also teen movie suitable teens all ages - little table dancing racy this one gets	1

captioning valuable service provide those us who need it . film quot ; mirandaquot ; there no english closed-captioning track , only concession captions all track spanish . i noticed british efforts frequently released without captions , quot ; mirandaquot ; there usual modern faults : nearly inaudible whispering , inadequate separation dramatic lines accompanying music , british terms pronounciations which americans need hear more accurately , so forth . use spanish subtitles not help whatever these matters . otherwise , i believe christina ricci suitably admired photographer	-1

sitting down watch this film hige smile came across my face just ten minutes because once kevin klines charactor outed his now famous student kamden ( dillon ) movie doesn't let up . i haven't seen movie kept me laughing so much very long time . kevin kline plays english lit professor who , i mentioned , get outed his former student while accepting oscar playing gay charactor so heat moment decided dedicate award his professor " he gay " point ... hilarity ensues . you see , kevin kline engaged emily ( joan cusack scene stealing performance ) they due married just two days ... so those two days he needs figure out if he really gay . one surprising thing tom sellick who doesn't even look same without his mustache ( he actually much better looking should keep it off ) tom plays reporter who intent getting kevin out himself , admitt himself he really gay , all while poor emily isn't sure if there even going wedding . movie great start finish it touch some deeper subjects line gay tollerance acceptance our society . when kamden outs his professor you get irritated when priciple ( played perfectly bob newhart !!! ) warns him if he doesn't get married he'll lose his job . it sad see way our society treat something they don't agree . all all this ( tagline states ) out out comedy , out out good time	1
me , this film matt damon , brilliant newcomer who came out ( seemingly ) nowhere . i floored his performance - one best 20th century . course he supported fine cast - robin williams , ben affleck , loveable minnie driver , whose onscreen chemistry damon sizzling . matt emerald heap cheap diamonds , obviously multi-talented guy - he co-wrote screenplay well starred it . well worth seeing .	1

bottle rocket not movie you're going like . trust me , you'll probably hate it . it comedy not over top funny , it very very subtle . it basically just wes anderson movie . owen wilson wannabe criminal who plans get local mob boss , his former employer , notice him his friends pulling off heist bookstore . they go lam hide out motel before circumstances send them back home . funniest lines aren't likely ones you'll notice first time through . talking tipping help motel , why they wear white tape their noses when pulling off bookstore job , bob mapplethorpe description why he should gang , dignan explaining why they didn't rob his mom home ... it subtle incredibly funny . this comic treat movie , but it one most people aren't going like first time through , unless you've already familiarized yourself other wes anderson flicks like rushmore royal tenenbaums . it certainly not my favorite movie , but it really good stuff . " she says you're like piece garbage ... it sounds better spanish .	1

this film you either get or you don't , i think zach braff great job his first film he wrote directed he managed leave indelible mark . characters great i felt like i could relate them ( or maybe not ) there some realy great scenes it . andrew largeman ( zach braff ) blamed his father ( ian holm ) freak accident which left his mother paraplegic , leaving his hometown new jersey large isolates himself world drifts los angeles working actor . when he hears his mother death however he forced return ' garden state ' reconsider his own life . way he meets alot his old friends sam ( natalie portman ) whom they both start relationship starts changing his life , there also some other wierd quirky characters like cop guy works hardware store . this very good film i'm glad i watched it cause i thought it would end up boring but it isn't i highly recommend this excellent drama/comedy film .	1
we went family theater see " charlie chocolate factory " . involvement tim burton johnny depp , need see treatment roald dahl classic children book got me interested . we ' 70s musical version gene wilder vhs . it ok but didn't quite capture dahl magic . this version less traditional musical all numbers featured oompa-loompas takeoffs big production numbers other movie musicals . i guess much could expected danny elfman , who music simpsons other burton movies ( including amazing " nightmare before christmas " ) . elfman also all oompa-loompa singing vocals . burton brings back story oompa-loompas willie wonka , while depp bring his own bizarre interpretation wonka role . it good followup his turn pirate jack sparrow " pirates caribbean . " other four kids who find golden tickets right mark -- gluttonous gloop , greedy veruca , vain veronica , smart-ass mike -- all get their just desserts , so speak . special mention also go deep roy ( indian actor , i assume -- how deep depp same movie ) who magic digital technology , plays all oompa-loompas , including one who wonka psychologist , young actor who plays good-hearted charlie title . squirrels also play important digitally-enhanced role . overall , this movie might little strange ( especially squirrels ) very small children , but good family fare its own style .	1

tyrone power not swashbuckler par errol flynn but this still decent movie genre . maureen o'hara helps out lot respect . power plays pirate captain caribbean who prays upon spanish shipping . he one infamous henry morgan lieutenants . show opens , morgan sent england stand trial piracy power captured spanish . he contemplating giving up pirate lifestyle but point becomes moot when he captured spanish . he showing defiance spanish governor suffering rack when rest pirates show up rescue him . victorious pirates their vengeance upon hapless cowardly spaniards when captain morgan shows up stops them . much everyone surprise , he pardoned king appointed new governor jamaica under theory he would most effective rooting out pirates . england now peace spain two want suppress freelance " free trade " . captain morgan hard position . he not trusted upper crust island neither he trusted all his old subordinates who determined continue their piratical ways . tyrone power one those trusted capt . morgan determined help him but his mind preoccupied . he love daughter former governor ( o'hara ) but she holds him contempt . finally , order secure all his aims , he goes " undercover " poses relapsed pirate . swashbuckler tradition , everything turns up roses after few swordfights broadsides . this not great movie but it enjoyable . still , i like flynn better .	1

... you . this film compared " logan run " , " matrix " , " coma " , name few , but it most strongly resembles 1979 movie " parts : clonus horror " , probably most widely screened viewers movie mock-a-thon " mystery science theater 3000 " . sitting through " island " , i kept thinking myself " boy , this looks familiar . " fact , " island " almost complete , play-by-play clone ( ba da ching ! ) " parts " , right down outfits worn clones . there currently lawsuit against bay brought makers " parts " , which should open-and-shut case . this film set futuristic clone colonie , where wealthy influential pay top dollar keep copies themselves available spare parts . clones kept docile dark facility employees , not allowed leave until they selected go almost mythical paradise ( island ) . course , clones allegedly going island actually euthanized their organs , their patrons gotten sick . movie focuses male clone who questions his environment eventually brings down enterprise . ewan mcgregor satisfactory this role , his acting reasonably good despite bland dialouge . his female counterpart , scarlet johansen , pure eye candy , mediocre actress who happens knockout blonde but leaves you wondering if she would get lead ( or even major part ) college play ( best performance turned sean bean , evil scientist� . ) there plenty action viewer chew , making entertaining enough popcorn movie , but it not only nothing special , it nothing original . maybe worth rental , but not much more	-1
kind me , go mark down horribly pretentious review unite : 02 . texh something demands interpretation , taken face value , it nothing . it noted all characters types , way , representing aspect human psyche . if you want interpret negative( ?, might actually positive or ambivalent ) conclusion end , it result fact every particular character incomplete . ichise f*cking stupid . he animal drive , which why powerless ran takes him . some episode , ichise remarks avoid ran prognostication(you destroy everything , you all alone end ) , he must take sophistication . civilization , rise above animal nature core his person . he remarks ran 25 , or 26 , he rushes back lux , since he met ran , he changed . before , whenever he met difficulty , he would critics texh claimed : " punch punch ! " episode 26 makes its response : ichise hasn't changed least . when onishi ordered ran kill her , ravaging mobs lux obliterates onishi , leaving only lumps texhnolyze his legs , ichise breaks into his signature rage . it references first episode : we cut flashback ichise living pit fighter . he punches mob , crushing their skulls , cheers crowd long since dead . blood pours floor rainlike torrent , staccato bullet fire . someone shoots his arm , severing control nerves . this extent his change : least he , accept his new body . he accepts his new arm , accepts his new leg . doc ghost high , returns her lab reactivates his texhnolyze . ichise , once more capable , slaughters mob . ichise , now without direction , searches nothing but ran . he heads opera house , seek kano find direction he not , himself . he meets kohakura his way up , sees rooted bodies shapes , unable kill , reduced staring their reality until end time . he meets kano . kano goes off long rant , how he never wanted go surface world first place : apparently , class manuevered their descent into lux , vast population guinea pigs . one doesn't know if gabe indigenous , or brought down class . this all method , it possible speculate kano raped ran . world texhnolyze , semen man apparently virulent poison times . yoshii killed hooker second volume coming her . his life energy overwhelmed woman , who only wishes live , who deprived any hope . here , kano might driven ran insane raping her . here , abortion murder : ran may ordered onishi abort pregnancy killing her . ichise , seeing ran corpsehead , attached obviously useless shape lifesupport unit , freaks out . he rages kano , ignorant . he punches kano head off . end , he resigned his fate . he badly wounded , probably die . he all alone end , after all . he can't allowed talk shapes rooted ground , steal their battery packs ensure their mobility . onishi arch conservative , other reviewer said his organization . he really can't effect any change , he cannot create future himself , organ , or lux(lukuss very funny , i'm told japanese version transliterates directly ruku9su or something . lukuss very similar lux , which : " international system unit illumination , equal one lumen per square meter .

director curtis hanson filmed many remarkable films : " la confidential " ( 1997 ) his most awarded film , " 8 mile " ( 2002 ) very good movie " her shoes " ( 2005 ) very successful incursion " family conflict " genre movie . " hand rock cradle " ( 1992 ) dramatic thriller full adrenalin . may some viewers plot quite predictable ... well it wasn't me ! i just seat edge my couch more than half movie . story follows : recently pregnant woman pays visit obstetrician discovers there new doctor there . dr. mott starts check-up ends sexual molestation claire . when she returns home she shares her anguish michael , her husband . they decide denounce dr. mott . here series dreadful events triggered : dr. mott commits suicide unable stand other patients denounces , his pregnant widow learns she broken spontaneous abort . some months later bartels enjoying their newborn michael convinces claire hire live-in nanny allowing her free time her occupations . after discarding some applicants , claire , " casually " meets " perfect nanny " : peyton flanders , who actually dr. mott widow seeking revenge . little little peyton disrupt bartels ' domestic life creating havoc amongst them , expelling gardener , arousing jealousies , emotionally separating claire her young daughter trying seduce michael . all this performed reckless duplicity . tension violence increases arriving hair-raising final scene . rebecca de mornay hideous nanny gives outstanding performance . i particularly surprised economy gestures she gives yet transmits viewer all volcanic passion her sentiments . ernie hudson mentally impaired gardener gives over par performance . last but not least robert elwit photography , especially home interiors , very good . thumbs up this movie ! reviewed max yofre .	1

i love watch action movies . better still , i love watch robert de niro action movies ( 15 minutes , men honour , godfather ... ) . i also love watch jean reno action movies ( professional , mission impossible , wasabi ... ) imagine my surprise , when i saw both robert de niro jean reno same action movie ! ronin very interesting movie . very exciting , too . it complex theme , twisting plot well perplexing subplots , exotic settings , rising falling actions , critical but unknown object pursuit , witty dialogue , all compounded host mysterious key characters their vague relationships ( ira terrorist , russian mobsters , ex-cia ex-kgb operatives ) . what i enjoyed most this movie watching sam ( robert de niro ) assuming role strategist snatch team . strategist , he always asking clarifying questions verifying details . i am amazed his astute power observation , shown below ... just name few scenes : - scanning surroundings various angles before entering pub checking out possible escape routes ; - sensing danger spotting sniper bridge while conducting covert weapon buying exchange near bridge ; - sizing up each member snatch team , especially gregor ( stellan skarsgard playing rogue electronics expert ) intentionally pushing cup over table edge ; - reconnaissance , testing camera taking photographs unsuspectingly hotel lobby creating diversion ... ; - noticing wrong suitcase immediately after ambush/shoot out ; - spotting wall advertisement possible lead whereabout russian mafia ; even vincent ( jean reno ) demonstrates it , especially when he spots , window cafe , young girl carrying metal suitcase , while trying figure out sam exact whereabout gregor , who switched stole original suitcase earlier . power observation obviously very important character trait ronin . i understand ronin masterless samurai . lone-wolf . maverick . mercenary . apparently , movie , each member snatch team ronin . movie , there even short history lesson exploits famous 47 ronins their eventual suicide ritual known sepaku , told jean pierre ( michael lonsdale ) . [ based actual historical events , only 46 them committed sepaku . last one pardoned shogun . ] most exhilarating parts movie obviously high-octane car chases rampant shoot-outs both nice paris settings ... quiet country road , highway then through busy side streets tunnel . there even amazing scene , showing sam doing his own surgery remove bullet his stomach mirror knife . most touching scenes movie dynamic comradeship seemingly mutual respect sam vincent , despite fact each them his own agenda snatch team . final scene , - fact throughout movie ' running time - , critical but unknown object pursuit remains mystery . conclude this review , i really enjoyed watching ronin very much . once again , i also learned human ingenuity creativity very important life ( or survival ) skills , characterised movie . this addition my resource repertoire .	1

before i bought this dvd used local store i hadn't even heard either series , much less seen them . i guess i fresh approach towards it since i didn't buy it simply because i liked series . ^_^ --- ninku movie ( more depth since no one really talked it yet ): fight scenes very well , even though no real weapons used ( i'm into sharp , pointy items shine :p ) . there lot detail used making special moves their effects . i didn't feel cheated all , even without any samurai swords . well known ninku , no one ever recognizes them ! fame fortune don't always go together they often searching ways get food money . circus performers pretend famous ninku team very town ninku arrive ! what worse , only job around imposters ' servents ! fusuke may look lot like child blank expression , but he captain first ninku division . movie , he shows himself very thoughtful , generous , loyal , level-headed guy ; what you'd expect leader . i found myself laughing him more than once during movie wondered how he could possibly former captain . i didn't any doubts once fight scene truely started . he becomes very serious vibe you get him changes . touji captain sixth division ninku . movie he seems rihoko brother . i shocked first see him tear off his clothes fight his underwear , but it became comical . aicho captain nineth division ninku . rihoko huge crush him he all he stay away her . rihoko doesn't fight , she just tags guys ( i'm pretty sure she fact touji sister ) . i think her main role comical relief occasional damsel distress , but i like her sometimes bossy character . penguin named hiroyuki . he very intelligent . unfortunely , he also tends really bad gas . poor fusuke seemingly faints when hiroyuki farts him movie . immature humor ? sure , but it still funny me . it isn't overdone or used bad taste , so i don't problem it . i'm sure it effective move fight . : poverall , it very funny , even if stupid kind way . --- yu yu hakusho : i could tell right away this movie best viewed after seeing series . i guess i lucked out store accidently gave me yu yu hakusho movie ( poltergeist report ) first accident . i got clue who who how they all felt each other . because i so new series i didn't really notice anything wrong characters or their voices , but i also confused certain things weren't explained because they assume you've watched series before movie . if you flexible let characters different than normal , then buy this used somewhere . it , far , not worth purchasing it brand new , so make sure you get it used	1

i vote no more after this one . first all , movie edited horribly . there numerous occurences where edits should tightened . acting so over top it ridiculous . mary griffith ( aimee graham ) father stereotypical demon father . we listen these kids talk camera throughout film how they live rave , so they one music how raveing druging their life ... i could only ask ... who cares ? then , kids all arrive rave . weehoo !! 45 minutes bah ! bah ! bah ! bah ! bah ! music seizure inducing strobe effects . kids so drugged up they spend most time sitting toilet . punks living beat up other kids . punks who riot create havoc no reason . drive shooting looked so fake overdramatized . gets you all teary-eyed . not because you any emotional connection any characters , but because you spent $1.50 renting movie discount day spent 80 minutes your life watching it ... well ... 72 minutes if you fast forward through credits ... 3:30 bah ! bah ! bah ! opening credits ... geez	-1
most films try capture significance sporting event by-gone era suffer because they fail attach it any historical context . upon first view , i thought " 61 * " somewhat guilty . it unfair opinion because time i just finished watching " seabiscuit " " miracle " , both which slightly superior films . now , however , i've change mind after second viewing . billy crystal enormous job capturing mm boys 1961 . crystal all bases covered ( bad pun intended ) . he covers maris ' can-do spirit he approaches babe single-season home run mark . however , crystal also covers hostility this drew press fans . barry pepper great job conveying maris ' quiet suffering anger spawned . meanwhile , maris ' friend , beloved mickey mantle also nearing ruth record , but doesn't generate such animosity . off field , however , crystal shows us mantle making changeover fun-loving young man almost self-destructing adult . around these two men , press -- specifically voracious new york press -- circles like vultures . side characters fairly well-rounded well-portrayed : specifically , anthony michael hall whitey ford . crystal fondness era evident every scene . fortunately , he doesn't wax too nostalgic . instead , he gives us honest view time when baseball barely clinging its innocence , man who not deserve hostility asterisk haunted him .	1
this unsparing , unsentimental look pro football which players alternately brutes , slaves management . coaches shamelessly manipulate players then discard them moment injury strikes ; players drugged up order coax them onto field , while same time unpopular players ensnared drug charges order trap them contract renegotiation time . " north dallas forty " probably one my favorite sports movies , definitely my favorite football movie . that because its defiant outsider approach -- " ball four " , baseball book made peter gent football novel possible , only ever wound up lame sitcom ; " north dallas forty " goes all way . even though movie based dallas cowboys 1960s , instantly dated 1970s ' filmmaking technique remains timeless ( even if it same director who made " weekend bernie " , which timeless very different reasons ) . part movie continuing appeal remains its cast . nick nolte brilliant lead , rebellious but hones t-t o-a-fault north dallas wide receiver phil elliott . phil tells it like it sees management what they , but doesn't realize he cheated out his career until third or fourth time he double-crossed owners , coaches friends alike . playing riff dandy don meredith , country singer/songwriter mac davis plays sly quarterback seth maxwell . rest football team filled out several ex-nfl players . john matuszak second acting career launched this movie , bo svenson football career should launched this movie . coaches , charles durning ( cliche-spouting offensive coordinator ) great g.d. spradlin ( playing thinly veiled tom landry ) both dominate their scenes . yes , that dabney coleman oil man part owner who delivers one movie best lines ( " you speak canadian ? " ) . dayle haddon looks great phil love interest , but otherwise gets overshadowed rest cast . she seems so disinterested phil throughout movie i convinced their relationship wouldn't make it week after story ended . kotcheff directs his football scenes interesting approach could never duplicated today : there not single wide shot packed house , not single closeup spectator north dallas face paint maxwell jersey . gone excesses modern tv football coverage , only product endorsement i could spot xylocaine . most early football action shown mute flashbacks , climactic game against chicago not joined until after two-minute warning . even such minimal football , however , kotcheff action so muddy , bloody cruel you imagine final game sequence cued up . . ' vcr fateful monday night he tangled joe theismann leg . always worth watching every late january , " north dallas forty " one those films you hope never going remade , because original everything you need football movie	1
don't make mistake i buying this copy this classic italian movie . it complete disaster faded colors grainy images . i can't beleive they put this one market . you'll get see three sketches all right , but transfer simply amateurish insulting . no subtitles , not even original italian track , no gallery photos etc . this worst dvd i ever bought . luckily others , new version released 2005 which proper treatment . i just hope visconti last movie innocent won't fall this category when they released it someday . let us pray preservation laura antonelli beauty	-1

" gary sinise george , lenny friend " caretaker , " i like him better than meredith same role back ' 39 . movie faithful adaptation , few minor changes : black man crooks , example , doesn't get involved george lenny scheme getting ranch " living off fat land " book . also whereas shooting lenny after he accidentally killed curley wife long drawn out ' 39 movie , here it relatively quick - though short flashback tag added no particular reason . it good production all around , certainly worth watch	1

tupac fan or not , this film affect you end . it takes you deep mental trip through this man life beginning end . yet , unlike most music documentaries , tupac narrates this film himself . using hundreds old interviews , both film also audio recordings . he tells his own story , his own way . film starts off showing journey tupac car through las vegas streets night he shot death . while you watch this song playing , one last songs he would ever . it so ironic because it talking what actually happend him night . " multiple gun shots fill block , fun stops . nigga call cops ... people shot , nobody stops . i wonder when world stopped caring last night . " tupac mother afenia , produced this film put all her heart soul into making it happen . god bless her strength so . tupac tells his story growing up poor without father lean . growing up community more drugs streets than food table . you get understand man behind music alot more . tupac like most us , angel devil rolled into one . public eye , tupac seen many thug evil man but he also same man recorded songs like " dear mama , keep your head up brenda got baby . " these songs showed his emotional side real deep concern future youth . however , tupac also got caught up angry , gangster life style rap music once he became famous . he even admitts film . " i immature my ego out control . i said alot stupid things i wish i could take back . " one most chilling scenes film first time tupac got shot five times new york recording studio 1995 . this what started east coast/west coast war rap music . film inter-cuts perfectly two stories shooting . tupac version what happend biggie smalls/puff daddy version . no , they don't match up . tupac went grave thinking they set him up night . once you see this , it up you decide yourself . all all , this fantastic documentay very talented music artist brings it you very human level .	1
aside " breakfast tiffany " " my fair lady , " audrey hepburn didn't get any better than this . hepburn plays ariane chavasse , parisian student cello who becomes enamoured rich , older american , frank flanagan , played gary cooper . flanagan seems like unlikely character return her love , however , he long history womanizing playboy . he even confesses ariane his belief couples " should always behave though they planes " his motto : " he loves runs away , lives love day . " you very easily predict how two going end up , but it happens , film ends , unpredictable , dramatic extremely moving fashion should leave most viewers misty-eyed . maurice chevalier excellent arianne father . some criticized gary cooper " too old , " i think film would absolutely perfect if he few years younger . ( why title my review says " almost perfect . " ) but cooper still excellent choice role . he looked good his age stage presence , time , unrivalled . ( since when tall , handsome , suave , rich men problems attracting younger women ? )	1
stuart gordon dagon surprisingly excellent bit lovecraftian horror , although it feels times like offspring one corman poe adaptations via very wet wicker man ezra godden finds himself rain-soaked fishing village spain where locals long since abandoned christian god ancient pagan one dagon return gold fish . unfortunately , side-effect three generations devotion they're all mutating into sea creatures tendency wear faces those stray humans who stumble across them get skinned alive or mated dagon their troubles ... it may sound cheesy , but while it not particularly frightening it played commendable straight face plenty atmosphere . it just shame writers got little too obsessive hero talking binary systems . lion gate dvd short extras , doesn't include original story listed packaging , but include couple audio commentaries star director , production sketches trailer .	1

this german film directed hermine huntgeburth like comic spin grifters but added sexual component . when one 3 petty criminals who wallet snatch using blind man ploy injured chase , replacement chosen someone who tried steal them failed . his punishment stripped two gay male members team , which prefigures sexual triangle eventuates when both father his daughter attracted new member . we know when we told group rule no exchange body fluids it said broken . huntgeburth gets comic mileage out who aggressor each relationship stolen moments intimacy they fear discovered third party . most refreshing touch how father ( gotz george ) established mean his gay partner , yet he becomes foolish when faced attentions younger man , if he cannot believe it possible , shakespearian appearance george emphasises him classically defined pathetic figure . george actually resembles brunette heavy-set ralph fiennes . daughter probably least interesting role , but felix eitner boy demonstrates bisexual trend modern sexuality , free sexual preference european men , question sex duplicitious behaviour . when eitner pet snake disposed cruelly , huntgeburth sets up expectation his own fate , snake metaphor . accordian music niki reiser sets tone it melancholy suggestion exotic mischief , thankfully huntgeburth treatment lacks concluding cruelty stephen frears title	1

look past surface this movie it really loneliness , range consequences around " falling love " someone you don't know . yeah , characters debauched , stupid things , but it all related their need " connect " someone . all them make mistakes , none them happy end . other reviewers mentioned , this isn't film everyone ; there several gross-out/desperate sex scenes , but they work context movie . i don't much more say hasn't already said ( said better ) other reviewers . i'll finish up adding if you went small , liberal arts college where everyone knew everyone , everyone business ( i ) , trust me , you " know " most people movie probably get weird combination nostalgia " thank god i'm past part my life !

performances flynn rathbone shine this fine remake 193o original - which conveniently used much same aerial footage . major brand ( basil rathbone ) , commanding officer squadron british royal flying corps stationed france , called butcher his top officer , captain courtney ( errol flynn ) - because his hardened attitude toward sending inexperienced young flyers their death . courtney his best friend , lieutenant scott ( david niven ) , their own way coping constant death new recruits ; they drink toast dead , sing song , then go back devising diverting , thrill-seeking pranks ... it implied howard hughes sued warner bros . claiming certain story ideas techniques which used this film curiously similar some those used his 193o production hell angels . hughes lost suit when it determined disputed ideas originated john monk saunders via his personal experiences air service : it basis first aa-winning film , 1927 silent wings . 1941 , warners blended aspects their 1936 film ceiling zero this one amp ; came up flight patrol (!) . among musical numbers which heard this vastly entertaining film include such vintage goodies pack up your troubles old kit bag amp ; poor butterfly	1
sorry , but giving this set bad rating just because aip-versions aren't included stupid my opinion . this box includes 5 fantastic movies bava ( yes , even " knives avenger " great one ) overall amazing quality very good bonus features . i believe there good reason ab didn't include different cuts " girl who knew too much " " 3 faces fear " : legal issues . if these solved , hopefully we see these versions someday dvd ( though only one really interests me " evil eye " . " black sabbath " would just nice because karloff own dubbing , but everything else clearly inferior italian version . ) until then - enjoy what this box , it amazing value cheap price . course many people who want buy this , already may different dvds some movies there - so everyone must decide themselves if it worth getting .	1

this film everything modern character studies long . ' five easy pieces ' revealing wayward culture ; it strikes audience its emotional interactions ; lets us peer into hearts minds very intriguing personalities . story follows robert dupea ( nicholson ) , who abandoned his well-to-do , intellectual family proletarian lifestyle manual labor promiscuity . his impetus clear beginning -- our culture restrictive absurd , must rejected . but refuting his old life doesn't exempt him world ludicrousness we find him restless discontented opening . arguments his girlfriend famous ' chicken salad sandwich ' scene epitomize this agitation . dupea returns his family under pretext attending his ill father . there , he finds what he believes could his salvation form sophisticated woman who also romantic optimistic ( she doesn't believe she ever bored ) . her , dupea sees reason justification his old life considers it once again . clash interest results , generating sharpest interactions bitterest conflicts . this clash all modern character studies aim . failing show value rejected old life , however , there no good reason clash character seen shallow heartless , leaving audience nothing study . enjoy this picture craftsmanship which rafelson molds internal conflict , art evidently admired these days very rarely achieved	1
while second movie gave us grand adventure first movie gave us ... well , movie , third gives us very mature story . we open dr. spencer hale his daughter , molly . molly only her father now . her mom vanished some time earlier research race pokemon called unown , which look like letters . hale taken up research she left behind , not just research but presumably find what happened her bring her back . every night , he reads his daughter before bed . her favorite book book legendary pokemon , including unown dog-type ( not lion-type ) called entei . molly drawn entei because his strength intelligence , compares her dad him . after bonding scene rings very real , e-mail comes skyler , hale assistant . he says he found old structure more clues unown , so hale leave meet him right away . molly disappointed she left alone , but goes sleep . temple , hale finds some stone pieces , sort like large runes , images unown them . he accidentally releases some , they open portal draw him inside . skyler doesn't see it , discovers too late hale gone . this leaves molly without father , just house caretaker skyler . molly doesn't understand what happened , one night goes her father things returned . included his gear chest held unown tiles . she spills chest open begins playing letters , spelling out mama , papa , molly . " they're together . me , " she says . but she also accidentally activates tiles , unown swarm into mansion . molly isn't afraid . " you want play me ? " unown read thoughts living things alter reality . this presumably what happened hale his wife : they wanted understand unown , so they took them their dimension . molly feels alone like world beyond her control , so unown turn mansion into crystal palace her dreams . they also create mighty entei , which molly immediately latches onto papa different appearance . entei simply says , " if what you wish . " now we get opening credits . i can't remember last time movie took long introduce its concepts instead cast . here comes ash ketchum , pikachu , misty williams , brock harrison . they traveling greenfield , one most beautiful places world . way , they meet lisa , pokemon trainer . she ash friendly battle , which introduces us ash line-up . unlike first movie , where opening battle rival trainer seemed cruel inspired ego , this plays more like it supposed -- friendly if competitive test coaching training skill . combatants all their pokemon all share lunch afterwards , fact , ash lisa complimenting each other reacting self-assurance modesty . she her way greenfield herself , offers guide them . when they get over hill , though , they find most grounds turned crystal hale mansion middle . tv news crew also shows up report phenomena . broadcast watched delia ketchum , ash mom . there some implication she long-time affection spencer hale she might his road not taken . news also seen professor samuel oak , ash neighbor hale teacher . he delia concerned hales , take off figure out what happened . while ash , his friends , oak , delia get together talk events , news crew gets delia camera moment . molly watching news entei her side . she recognizes delia some pictures her hale around house . staring longingly delia , she tells entei , " i want mama , too . " entei leaves long enough hypnotize delia into thinking she molly mother taking her mansion . it falls ash his friends rescue his mom . you might wondering where team rocket , pokemon theives consisting humans jesse james their pokemon comic foil meowth . they get very little screen time , showing up long enough establish their presence , get shot down their balloon , wander through mansion provide some comic relief , save ash falling one scene . they even acknowledge how skimpy their parts , meowth asking one point , " you think we'll get bigger parts next movie ? " how much you enjoy movie hinges primarily how much you believe ' two goal , three act ' story structure villian capturing loved one unite protagonist two goals vital film . like other movies , there isn't really bad guy sense doing something rotten due some feeling personal anarchy . even mewtwo first film didn't seem evil so much misguided needing taught . lot critics i've read complain unown aren't very intimidating villians , but they aren't supposed . they catalysts , plot devices if you . entei literally serves molly wishes , fueling his actions . strictly speaking , movie four seperate goals , stopping entei , saving molly , saving delia , stopping unown , each requiring seperate action . film continually advances no clear act division well . if ' two goal three act ' structure vital you , you definitely not enjoy this film . characterization here full force , characters behave very realistically . best example this brock . brock hound dog . let almost any woman appear , save misty or jesse team rocket ( might missed someone ) , he hit them . jesse villain ( sort ) , misty both too young him they've through enough together she more sister than possible love interest . when molly dreams she pokemon trainer so she battle ash company , she morphs into full grown woman . brock doesn't hit her , though , he remains focused situation , remarkable change . likewise , his banter during duel molly remains true . he fewer instances captain obvious , likewise oak fewer instances captain explination . lisa seems exist just show ash pokemon line-up give him cell phone " pokegear " before he sets off rescue , but even she exudes certain behaviors , like confident strut not swagger . but deepest characterization goes little molly . even when confronted fact world she inhabits not real , she still clings fearfully papa . crystal spikes form walls around her when ash intrudes tries take delia away . ash charizard get upper hand ( during entei vs . charizard sequence ) , spikes start shooting out castle walls aiming them . everything molly dreamworld , including cold inner sactum , reflects her scared mentality . during pokemon fights brock misty , where her tiny creatures score victories against giants like onix only few blows , she laughs delight things go so well her . her laughter frightening since she not feeding her ego , but gorging it . this film dark probably deepest storytelling series likely see . it also coupled , once again , one those annoying shorts start , this one introducing pichu , lower form pikachu . like pikachu , they almost human-level intelligence rambunctious streak . one pichu , seeing pikachu , pats his ass couple times . then later pulls down corner his eye pikachu , which rude gesture japan ( " dear jack valenti , thank you rating . lots love , warner bros . " ) . it bits contradict pokemon continuity don't make any contextual sense , but art nice there some humor . poster says short features " dozens new pokemon their first ever animated appearance . " don't too impressed , i counted only 14 , i think some them appear tv show first . once again , use time get your snacks go bathroom , real movie starts afterward . afterthought : complaint critics how molly reunited her dad , then her mom , long shots during end credits . this portion movie sort travelogue ash journey , giving wonderful sense scope his adventures . one critic particular says this robs scenes their emotional impact . i think it actually helps . movie american pie , characters learn sex isn't everything . yet not one them still virgin end flick . yeah , they learned their lesson , their reward completely negates it . pokemon 3 , defining moment molly life when she opts leave crystal mansion , bravely facing uncertain world without help unown . her reunion her parents important , but it further development her life , not event solidified her personality enabled her take world . coming travelogue , alongside ash he continues see expand his world , makes alegorical sense . but that just me . ----- this review original location site called ' keeping it reel -- movie reviews peter ' . thought it would nice put it here	1

red lantern carefully crafted story centered around young woman named songlian , played ever-brilliant gong li . songlian hopes dreams college better life cruelly cut short sudden unexpected death her father . no money school insistence her mother , songlian forced marry chen , wealthy landowner who already three wives his own . each wives reside separate wings his centuries-old castle estate . living quarters extremely upscale come complete personal servant maid . but , like storied bird gilded cage , their lives sad , empty lonely . although wives command respect obedience hired help , they nothing more than chattel wealthy chen . each day , wives , their respective servant , stand entrance their quarters waiting see which door " red lantern " placed . this how chen chooses his wife evening . " lucky " chosen wife treated ritual foot massage one older woman servants her apartment filled large glowing red lanterns which burn brightly through night . there so many lanterns set up both inside out it , first appearances , seems romantic but quickly ends up underscoring true nature rite . it custom quickly becomes apparant nothing more than lewd , sadistic sexual subjugation . it not romantic , it not passionate ... it just cruel game chen entertainment . story progresses , we see struggle almost every scene . there secret alliances wives , servants elite frequent master estate . there continual animosity wives they plot scheme stay viable remain master good favor . there oversupply backstabbing , betrayal class struggle found all major players . we also see formation disintegration relationships wives . , although master tries present himself peacemaker , it gradually realized he actually instigator most hostility . wives scratch claw ( metaphorically , ) his attention only serves satisfy his own massive ego . cycles abuse perhaps no more apparant when we see wives , who clearly victims their own right , begin victimize each other attempt elevate their standing within social order castle . film rich many moments both sad poignant . example , although songlian not originally welcome ritualistic foot massage , she grew like it missed it tremendously those nights when she not selected " wife evening " . she , other unchosen wives , endure very loud rattling sound foot massage across courtyard . it only further reminded them they unwanted they not special . she miss actual foot massage or what massage represented ? it became nothing more than cruel pavlovian experiment part chen . chen seems enjoy manipulating women . alternating reward punishment , he carefully trains them if they pets . castle cauldron sorts it only matter time before everything bubbles over . without giving too much away , i'll only say storyline moves resulting tragic consequences could hardly seen entirely unexpected . heart this film its exploration indomitable female psyche . film continually centers around very strong female characters struggling survive under horrific conditions both psychologically emotionally . ability female psyche maintain personal identity spiritual freedom within male-dominated zeitgeist feudal china intrinsic this story although this sort struggle not really unique asian culture , it handled very deliberate unapologetic fashion makes this film not only special watch but , necessary well . i've working backwards through director , yimou zhang body work , process i unwittingly saved best last . just kidding ... well , maybe little . yimou zhang certainly director who likes experiment . it seems like he not content make same film over over no matter how good recipe . each his films unique distinct quality . this film lensed very traditional straightforward fashion equal amounts closeups far shots . storyline engrossing carried rich narrative style . dialogue , although integral story seems almost secondary unspoken communication form facial expressions , body language other physical interactions characters . film many long visual sequences which seemed tell story better than any carefully worded text ever could . my opinion , this gong li finest performance date i highly recommend seeing this film	1

i grew up pink panther , it blast able see them all again . i've only finished first disk , but these cartoons excellent . times trickster times tricked , pink panther such outstanding character he pulls you no matter what part he plays . special features fifth disk fun too , especially title credits peter sellers ' " pink panther " movies . that where i started -- watching opening credits " pink panther " then going back first short early 60s . other reviews right when they say some weaker cartoons ones where pink panther talks . it seems so superfluous , like they threw voice him because they needed . but i see where animators just getting sense character those early shorts , it probably worth experimentation just see if it worked . fortunately , saner heads prevailed , pink panther quickly lost his voice . occasional laugh track equally jarring , again appearing one short not next . overall , this set certainly worth it pink panther fans young old . humor light , animation fun stylized , soundtrack rocks . this cartooning its best	1

i invariably credit robert . howard genius behind conan however , this film john milius brilliant it own right . look , if i summed this movie up one word , word would ' epic ' . you feel like you like you've just landed yourself somewhere euro-asian steppe before tides history washed upon mankind . version i bought complete quest which carries both conan movies . conan destroyer ( sequel ) more goofy 80 pizzaz i recall growing up but don't knock it until you try it ! also note soundtrack basil pouldoris . conan soundtracks arguably most superlative movie soundtracks all time . basil pouldoris ties his magic give this conan what i call infinite watchability ... these movies never get old no matter how many times you see them . all characters some extremely memorable lines you grow love . schwarzenegger himself epitomy laconic philosopher stoic warrior approach life but even he breaks out some killer lines . hell , i just wish arnold would third conan instead playing politician	1

i wanted like this film . reviews i read it weren't very optimistic but i don't believe everything i read . unfortunately , this time reviewers correc t.t he dying gaul sensationalistic look people , quite frankly , disgusted me . i am not talking sexual preferences here . these people disgusting so many reasons , none which sexual preferences . i stomach characters unsavory if there common sense perspective given their actions . this film , however , characters revealed decent people who make mistakes . nope . they all creeps . plot film writer screenplay gets emails what he believes his dead lover . what up ? this educated person . he able create complete screenplay so his use language must above average . yet , believe dead person would communicate living - through emails , no less - not something even your average person would fall . yes , there relationship facts given emails but he confided facts person one sending emails . plot film gets even more laughable - yes , i found myself laughing this movie - when old medea plot line came into play . , i'm referring greek medea , not african-american one . although , her films least entertaining ! acting this movie not good others said . sarsgaard most annoying . some scenes he pronounced lilt his speaking voice attempt sound " gay . " other scenes he speaks normally . i found this very distracting . campbell scott , he gives same performance i've seen him give other films . he isn't bad actor but he no paul newman . them all , clarkson bes t.t he dying gaul pretentious project insulting gays buddhists . yes , buddhism plays role film , too . if you want see gay film go brokeback mountain . if you want see movie , time , prove one those wonderful films provokes gales laughter because it so unintentionally funny , watch dying gaul . just prepared learn more specifics gay sex than you probably want know	-1
out all endless undying jason films , this one few series actually provides some scares regardless relentless predictibility . ( jason never dies . dumb blondes run out back door instead front door like they should . car ignition won't work all right times . women make obnoxious screams when they're hiding just merely say ' jason i'm here!' yatta-yatta-yatta ! ) one interesting scene ( obviously i'm male my prime when i say this ) when two lovers humping ' 80s rock music back camper . camper jumping up down . i think majority heterosexual men , when watching scene , left thinking " how come my girl doesn't me ? " these cheesy slasher horror films 80 genre don't much merit categories acting skills , realistic gore or physical animation . but , some kinky sex scenes without overtly pervasive pornographic content playboy some horrific surprises , it proves nice viewing couple dating steadily . so , grab your popcorn your hormones . remember , same hormones chemicals our bodies regulate sexuality also regulate aggression , fear , anxiety , happiness . ( testosterone , oxytocine , adrenaline , etc . ) so , when you combine all these elements into hour half screen interactions this caliber , then it proves quite opportunity some foreplay imagination .	1
my son ( 3 yrs old one month ) watches this car loves this video . he pretty crazy trucks , tractors , like , but some videos just too advanced technical . this one great . tractor segment ( mostly farm tractors ) farm vehicle segment , they show lot different aspects farming , including steps seedling harvesting , eating what you grow , visiting dairy farm ( what made dairy products ) , even using airplane spray insecticides fertilizers . but this all todler- young child level , main guy , dave likeable , very importantly , his voice not annoying all . dump truck segment great , too- they show all different kinds , all different activities- even filling up gas , which toddlers so fascinated . there no catchy tunes , but plus , since they so often what makes video unbearable adults . this video really well , all live action video , narrator acting important participant . it completely holds attention my son , i actually enjoy it .	1

so far , i've bought mutant season one dvd 1 thru 5 . i think this show very high tech stylized . i like how it filmed wide screen . characters kool enjoy stories very much . shalamar best character show primal mutant abilities . this show sometimes hard find channel my area . i missed most season 1 amp ; 2 but luckily , my satelite provides mutant cable network . these dvd top quality yet bit expensive haven't too impressed special features ... one disc bloopers -- it mix match clip collection lasted whole whopping 1 minute 32 seconds ... i love this show , but hope next release seasons , it packaged better features better price range ... only reason i'm buying these becuase i missed seeing show when it first came -- but c'mon they could least put 3 episodes disc if selling individually .. i mean , buffy seasons you get around 40 bucks it 22 episodes your getting .. here , you get 4 episodes like 40 bucks ? talk inflation .. lol ... btw , mutant signed 4th season ! paying hefty price season 1 i live , but really hope seasons 2 thru 4 better wallet ... otherwise , i just may skip out buying them ..	1

" seinfeld " pretty good job rebounding larry david departure show . jerry doesn't many segments featured around him this season , possibly because stepped up demands his time behind camera . however , ones which he featured very funny . example , jerry check bounce , unfriendly merchant puts returned check display his store . word gets back jerry parents , they jump conclusions decide jerry must broke . jerry dad decides return work help support jerry . unfortunately , job his dad takes working elaine , situation doesn't work out anyone . george , reeling mixed emotions he losing susan end season seven , prepares go without her , but finds he really can't . instead , susan parents start charitable foundation her memory george installed board large framed photograph susan framed wall room where foundation meetings held . later season , george meet woman he interested , she seems interested him . george , always trying better his position through lying but usually just worsening his lot because it , same thing this instance . woman believes george tourist arkansas , george decides continue deception faking move city so he continue relationship . way george sees it , if you condense everything he accomplished last ten years into just few weeks , it seems quite impressive . elaine enters alternate universe when she meets kevin his friends , who turn out opposite jerry his friends every way . she likes fact kevin his friends inspire her better person - they genuinely kind helpful they enjoy reading . however , ultimately elaine just not cut out among them because her own selfish personality traits . perhaps funniest episode featuring elaine " english patient " , titled after best picture winner 1996 . her boss , eccentric peterman , loves film forces her go see it him . elaine hates movie , just can't take sitting through it its entirety without blurting out how she feels . peterman gives her chance penance her bad attitude which involves most hilarious assignment . " susie " , due series mix-ups , elaine winds up alternate identity work - " susie " . her coworkers begin discussing her though elaine susie two different people . her ultimate solution problem susie " die " , complete memorial service fictitious woman winds up packed mourners . course , kramer adventures unbelievable ever . this season his apartment turns into " red planet " due neon sign kenny rogers roasters restaurant shining through his window all night . first he doing everything he put restaurant out business , but when he jerry temporarily switch apartments pressure off , kramer finds himself addicted restaurant food . episode , elaine boss jay peterman trying write his memoirs , but finds his own life isn't very interesting . his solution buy kramer life story use it his own . kramer peterman eventually get into argument over details arrangement , kramer answers back starting his own " peterman reality tours " . finally , kramer incensed fact he no longer find public place which he light up cigar , opens smoking lounge his own apartment . result all exposure tobacco smoke , kramer ages prematurely goes his attorney friend , fas t-t alking flamboyant jackie chiles , file suit against tobacco companies . when kramer negotiates deal tobacco companies without jackie approval , jackie declares results " most public his many humiliations " . summary , this season very good more emphasis fast-paced zaniness rather than comedy made more commentary human nature you saw during larry david years . however , i still highly recommend it	1

" dreamgirls , " originally hit broadway production 1980s , lavish musical inspired history motown its super group supremes . like songs " grace my heart " which clearly based career carole king , soundtrack music " dreamgirls , " good it , can't match power real motown sound . actually film musical numbers hardly sound like motown sound , but still some them real showstoppers thanks film gifted stars , especially dynamic singing voice oscar-winner jennifer hudson . " dreamgirls " you should not expect much story , which runs familiar course superstars or celebrities , meteoric rise three rb singers ( played beyonc� knowles , jennifer hudson anika noni rose ) fame their subsequent troubles ego-clashing within members their shrewd , business-minded producer/manager ( jamie foxx ) . it same old story you heard somewhere else gossip magazines . . once three girls ' dreams come true glitter showbiz , it takes center their lives , once it , none characters allowed breathe much . anika noni rose danny glover not given enough time their characters , even role beyonc� knowles not fleshed out satisfactorily . eddie murphy outstanding popular singer ladies ' man named james " thunder " early ( haircut like little richard ) , but there nothing new thunder story his love affair fading stardom . still i enjoyed watching " dreamgirls " . i know it lots shortcomings , i hear complaints fans original stage ( which i haven't seen ) . yes , i know . perhaps number film shortcomings depends each viewer taste or expectations , i liked filmed version " dreamgirls " what it . i like it its entertainment values such gorgeous costumes , beautifully staged live scenes cinematography , plus powerful , emotionally-charged songs jennifer hudson , all which compensate lack better story	1

mountbatten described historian man whose " immense vanity hunger publicity power , coupledwith his vaulting ambition propensity realigning thetruth narrowly outweighed his colossal energy charm " . all this portrayed brilliantly nicole williamson this superb production mountbatten terms last viceroy india well its first governor-general . however , this series not only focus mountbatten but shows political religious forces work brought both india independence , but also savage violence accompanied partition sub-continent legacy hate religious fanaticism now threaten not only successor states , india , pakistan bangladesh , but possibly entire world due their nuclear arsenals . series also features excellent performances janet suzman lady edwina mountbatten who one great " do-gooders " history , vladek sheybal enigmatic , iron-willed , tubercular mohammed ali jinnah , especially sam dastor gandhi whose portrayal him far superior ben kingsley film " gandhi " . one drawback series it based heavily memoirs mountbatten his assistant alan campbell-johnson who clearly biased against jinnah fans nehru gandhi , blaming partition india solely jinnah " stubborness " . other historians more nuanced view indian leaders pointing out jinnah accept idea united india under loose federal system it nehru gandhi congress party rejected it giving jinnah no alternative but seek total separation india muslims . similarly , jinnah portrayed responsible war kashmir , whereas according rules defined partition , majority religious group should able choose which successor state they associated , but kashmir majority muslims never given this opportunity becuase nehru , kashmiri himself , insistent taking kashmir india . none this detracts , however , sheer pleasure seeing this vast panorama portrayed television . anyone interested great historical events or personages enjoy this series	1

ruthless people brilliant 1980 comedy still entirely enjoyable two decades later ( just enjoy posh interior decorating schemes , full triangles random colors ! ) . don't read convoluted plot synopsis provided amazon . basics this : danny devito millionaire character ( he fashion designer called spandex mini skirt king ) wants murder his harping , overweight , annoying wife , played bette midler . fortunately him , day he plans take her out , judge reinhold his wife kidnap midler character get ransom get back devito stealing their fashion ideas . great ! now all devito refuse pay ransom go against all kidnappers ' demands , his little problem solved ! it not so simple , plot turns crazy point , some crosses double-crosses , extortion chief police , dumb boy-toy boyfriends , adulterous affairs , disturbed neighborhood serial killers , clown suits . cast this movie amazing . midler stands out most , woman who goes through metaphorphasis during her kidnapping . reinhold perfect balance genuinely nice guy who wants so hard ruthless criminal . devito pure slime , though through . also , bill pullman supreme foolish blond boy-toy , possibly " stupidest man world .

" happy birthday me " not great movie any stretch imagination . fact , one could even say it not good , but there any denying this movie product 1980 slasher movement horror movies ? either you like 80 slasher movies or you not ... either way this movie part parcel 1980 horror cinema . when i first saw this movie when i kid , i not find it scary then , nor i find it scary now some 25 years later . said , " happy birthday me " dark little tale full surprises . first , you " who dunnit " theme working quite well throughout movie , end movie you couple twists kind surprise you funny kind way . basically , " happy birthday me " girl who trouble remembering dark moment her past when her friends not come her birthday party ... he mother quite angry it . now , she still got her friends , but they dropping like flies this movie one one . there quite few gruesome ( although not necessarily realistic ) " death " scenes which keep gore hound fairly satisfied . suspense decent , but drags little bit flashbacks movie seems " tongue cheek " quality it rather than purely horror characterization . ending my opinion kind lame , but some people love it sure . movie keep you guessing least certain degree , but not enough keep you edge your seat . overall , " happy birthday me " not great suspense flick or horror movie any stretch imagination . sure , there plenty surprises , but surprises only go so far movie like this ... it takes more than some kills , " who dunnit " plot bunch twists make good horror movie . clearly , acting kind bland includes ms. little house prairie too . " happy birthday me " definitely missing something . there some character development , but weakness cast very evident certainly hinders this movie this regard overall well . however , " happy birthday me " just enough keep you watching decent enough kills keep horror movie honest . all all , this really very average horror movie which best appreciated someone who lived through 80 , appreciates horror genre during this time period . you probably won't get scared this one , but you might enjoy this flick its nostalgia , 80s cheese classic slasher pattern if nothing else . so , this group early 20 somethings find out who killer before they all killed off ? , why they killed ? who killer ? what lead character loss memory any this ? answers all these questions more revealed this 80s slasherfest , " happy birthday me "	-1

shakespeare comedy , " much ado nothing , " only positive effect its audience when read . his use verbal sarcasm intellectual farce turns circumstances love into exactly what they many times truly : comedy . shakespeare creates situations appear serious characters within script , yet actually humorous audience . because they able observe things characters themselves not privy , audience able witness full absurdity many messes created within plot characters themselves . while evaluating this play , i found it interesting while shakespeare comedies , " midsummer night dream , " demonstrates how it love causes us foolish things , " much ado nothing " shows way people complicate love themselves . each comedy centers theme love , making it comedic entertaining , yet two hold contrasting views . characters ' actions " midsummer night dream " involuntarily controlled their affections , whether they real or perceived , yet actions those found " much ado nothing " what control outcome love created . throughout this story , shakespeare purposes illustrate many foolish things individuals which only complicate love further than it already . many continually deny how they feel , case benedick beatrice , while others , like claudio , quick fall into love just eager fall out again . love fickleness shown when claudio jumps quickly sharp accusations based upon false testimony , again when benedick beatrice fall love due supposed affection other . story also demonstrates how others manipulate affections , negative or positive results . leonato , don john , other miscellaneous characters add complexity show increase havoc comes increase people situation . this play communicated strongly me circumstances not always entirely complicated they appear . just false identities twisted facts create unneeded , yet hilarious , tension throughout story , putting more stress importance issues within my life makes them more they truly . because this , it not always situation problem , but my own distorted view it . claudio assumptions hero promiscuous nature benedick beatrice quick reaction gossip heard each other two images my own tendency take specific circumstances extreme they should never reach . this play therefore not only enjoyable me read ; it brought light one my strengths times becomes my personal downfall , , making me more conscious this fact , allowed me potential correct it sooner . i wholeheartedly recommend this book , especially those enjoy shakespearean theatre well good laugh . it hilarious story how manipulation our own choice action create complicated labyrinth we unable get out , times don't ever want . shakespeare excellent job poking humor into crevices every situation , lightheartedly reminds us end it our own decisions create , or destroy , mangled outcome we receive .	1

movies this collection some bestin one set i've seen . everyone winner ! first disc last there isn't dudin set . if you like film noir this setwithout spending fortune .	1
this movie pictured sizable segment u.s. population not gotten much attention movies - high involvement mediterranean family . many italians i know said it could their family . movie works so well because author star really lived knew life she depicted . i enjoyed wry humor . beginning i prepared hate her father . he so sexist bullying anti-intellectual . women family so cynically manipulative . it not occur me until late into movie father really afraid . he only best mind his family , included his daughters , he too felt out his element different mix cultures united states . one other detail pleased me ; role community college helping people break free confining life move up world . not only they learn academic things , they meet wonderful people other cultures there , fall love , marry them . photography wonderful acting superb , especially since movie made tight budget . this one best films i seen past ten years .	1
every time i view these dvd there something i see it makes one think use our minds rather than just watching it .. i watch these over over get new message two each time , just wonderful using mind this manner ..	1
horrid movie . i can't believe how disappointed i am this anime . i heard so much it how it story same time most touching sad . but it not . little girl annoyed me so much . i just can't stand spoilt kids like seita probably would not died if it not her . omg she just annoyed me so much throughout whole movie . can't stop ranting yeah ... those who haven't seen it , you might like it like everybody seems but ... i would not recommend it al	-1
i looking billy elliot more than two years . i heard it should very good or even excellent film reason watching it i seen several working title films before ( boy , notting hill , love actually , four weddings funeral ) i found all them much more sincere emotional than average hollywood products . also these british films something offer you rarely find hollywood movies : charming heartwarming mixture sweet funny comedy inspiring touching drama . last month , finally , i found tape . very first moments movie my eyes riveted screen when movie ended feelings emotions overflowed me . billy elliot my opinion billy elliot brilliant movie , easily one best movies year most likely current decade . director movie stephen daldry brought us exceptional , truly inspiring moving , emotional poignant movie . entire story all characters completely believable atmosphere small provincial town somewhere north-eastern england skillfully captured transmitted us . sometimes movie sad , sometimes it funny but stephen daldry work never leave you indifferent . story occurs small coal-mining town 1984 there signs severe depression all over town . you see all around shadow distress even poverty . some simple but incredibly powerful scenes bring us sad feeling hopelessness even despair . there big coalminers strike town but it easy see it also hopeless strike . but all this only masterfully recreated background main story title character , twelve years old boy . he recently lost his mother both his father elder brother striking coalminers . billy forced his father attend boxing classes one day accidentally he see girl ballet classes occur same room he find ballet much more interesting than hated stupid boxing . so he attends those ballet classes instead boxing there nothing surprising after few weeks his father suddenly finds out billy didn't attend boxing worst all he attending ballet classes . main conflict occurs . billy must fight his choice , fight against his own family . there two stereotypes against him . first one ballet girls , not boys ( lads football ... or boxing ... or wrestling ) . second sounds even worse : all male ballet dancers gays . billy not but no one his family except aged grandma want even heard ballet . there only two people whole town , who support him - middle-aged ballet teacher mrs. wilkinson his friend michael , who same age billy who found he possibly gay . this gay subplot easily became conservative audience very controversial question . but fact such stereotypes not invented director movie if you would try learn more this terrific picture you found jamie bell , who took dance lessons age six , suffered similar sneers taunts . billy problem he must fight not only against bad obstacles misunderstanding but also against strong social stereotypes . several brilliant come scenes bright humor greatly emphasize struggles main hero . jamie bell playing billy best performances ever among young actors . his performance ( particularly dance sequences ) so genuine , bright sincere all time we easily feel expression young boy , not director , choreographer or writer . bafta award best actor year well-deserved it pity conservatism academy too often becomes insuperable obstacle many great movies . julie walters ( academy nomination best supporting actress ) billy ballet teacher also great job talented woman talented women who forced teach small provincial town pitiful salary . chemistry teacher student great line billy elliot . two other important supporting characters - billy father elder brother tony also excellent their evolution perfectly showed stephen daldry direction . beautiful soundtrack perfect combination classic ( including nice reference great swan lake ) modern music . original " " rating shouldn't mislead you . except strong language it should easily pg-13 . but this very rare case where some strong language profanity necessary authenticity characters understanding . movie suitable teens it definitely able give some good lessons them . 10 out 10 looks well deserved . thanks reading sorry my bad englis	1

those who read other reviews yours truly , this review , but i divide science fiction into three categories : true science fiction , science fantasy , science horror . often , science horror could called true science fiction , because it based what could happen . however , true science fiction focused more possibilities human reaction , while purpose science horror movie terrify you . this movie terrify you . this movie excellent job its twists turns plot ; you jump least once time movie over . schwarzenegger excellent villain , linda hamilton michael biehn turn good performances . it also small role beth motta , who i remember exercise instructor 20 minute workout , exercise program . one challenge science fiction dealing time travel into past . this successfully achieves goal . i would recommend this movie	1

i surprised this workout , i actually like it ! i usually find stott workouts too boring but it refreshing using 2 weighted balls pilates routine . moira instructs 3 students who perform exercises different levels , they use balls every single exercise , even pushups when you put one ball your calves one your knees while doing them , end workout i really sweating feeling fatigued upper body but i don't weight train all(i just pilates yoga ) so people who , it might easy . i use 2.2 pound ( 1kg ) balls i bought local store , not stott balls ( it doesn't really matter ) . workout 40 min . stott pilates toning ball workout called " amazing tone " according them theyre very similar except this one few extra exercises supposed " teachers " " avid home exercises " so don't buy both them	1

_triumph will_ ( original german : _triumph des willens_) most infamous propaganda film featuring nazis third reich 1934 nuremberg party rally notorious german film maker leni riefenstahl . movie obviously centers around nazi fascination all-powerful " power " attempts show what accomplished application such political . film features such nazis heinrich himmler , joseph goebbels , rudolf hess , hermann goering but most its focus directed adolf hitler ( " der fuerher " ) . basic point film seems propagandize national socialists showing germany great power strength german military people . film also features appearances s.a. , s.s. , " hitler youth " , all praised hitler himself . most film consists marches german stormtroopers , accompanied music richard wagner ( beloved hitler ) " horst-wessel-lied " or party rallies speeches hitler himself or other notorious nazis . movie also shows much accompanying scenario germany time well featuring scene which farmers dressed traditional garb present fruits their labors hitler . such appeals tradition common among nazis . throughout film , german male soldier/worker presented youthful , exuberant , strong , fertile , powerful . ( some scenes involving young german men frolicking , shaving , even bathing while bare-chested could probably frankly described homoerotic . ) hitler speeches themselves ( well speeches other nazis presented this film ) powerful disturbing . hitler explains his position attempts demonstrate power his party nation . one particularly revealing point , hitler states " state not order us , we order state ! " . other times , various nazi officials express fact " hitler germany " . this sums up cult personality surrounding der fuerher . ( hitler uncanny ability mesmerize people during his speeches commented upon frequently . some maintained hitler himself almost occult influence such times . various theories suggested explain how he came such powers . ) ironically , no point film single anti-semitic phrase uttered . this may intentional . what seen this film though power nazi state military . further , esoteric elements nazi party present , including such features swastika bizarre cult surrounding " blood banner " ( flag carried nazis during beer hall putsch revered nazis since time ) . many noted nazi party itself may constitute form ersatz religion . example , conservative theorist eric voegelin ( who himself escaped germany time ) maintained nazism constitutes " political religion " . such quasi-religious aspects certainly present this film . ultimately though , me least , film pointed out lurking danger may found all crowds group-think . such " herd instinct " overtakes many those present crowd their very selves merge rest crowd , party , nation , german people pseudo-mystical union . thus , may understood mystical aspect national socialist movement , herein , partly lay its appeal . woman who made this film , leni riefenstahl ( 1902 - 2003 ) , interesting enough person herself . begin , one must note time , this film represented advance film technique . indeed , entire film very well put together effectively accomplishes its purpose propagandizing nazis . riefenstahl herself german film-maker who became fascinated nazis time . later , she maintain she politically na�ve largely ignorant sorts crimes they committing ( whether or not she disingenuous this point obviously debatable ) . after world war ii , riefenstahl kept french detention camp some time . she investigated period but never convicted during de-nazification process . later , she would continue produce other works art , but ultimately she remains most ( in)famous this piece . movie itself disturbing one , ultimately , light crimes war . it speaks danger fanaticism . ultimately , despite propaganda presented this film , hitler not serve german people well , betray them very end ( when many innocent germans butchered soviet soldiers ) . this say nothing course hitler other , more notorious , crimes .	1

i wasn't expecting much pulse , such low expectations , i wasn't disappointed . it everything one- or two-star movie could hope . what i find disappointing they good idea somewhere , but everyone working film , top down , seemed miss it . then again , it remake japanese horror classic ( japanese horror films rarely , if ever , make sense ) , so they weren't trying find original story . pity . otherwise quiet college town , suicide rate skyrocketing . eventually our heroes , mattie ( kristen bell ) dexter ( ian somerhalder ) realize there virus , sorts , " system " , odd , silvery specter-like creatures cause it . these creatures , never explained , put themselves face-to-face their victims then it seems they inhale suck some essence their victim , which feeds them - somehow . it makes good viewing , but it doesn't make much sense . because it doesn't make sense , we're not " creeped-out " . since i'm reviewing this dvd , not film , i'm giving it two-stars - because first time i recall , special features subtitled . i'm hearing impaired , i normally miss out special features , even though these special features weren't all exciting , i able watch them .	-1

i am cyclist runner i looking something suppliment rodney yee ( best yoga dvds available ) dvds i . i bought this one specifically because it claimed workout designed different sports . well , it major let down . this tape absolute beginners only . it zero flow it frustratingly slow . they spend several minutes each pose , not holding pose , but just slowly getting you pose then holding it 10 seconds after two or three minutes explanation . its maddening . there no continuity . i would imagine if you true beginner this dvd might marginally useful but once you mastered basic poses it offers , you would then lose interest it because it painfully slow pace . i personally half one hour work out couldn't finish it , it driving me nuts . i went back my rodney yee world right again ....	-1

when i first tracked down copy this film ebay , i bit skeptical . would film live up hype ? could film this many popular voice actors actually inspired ? would this animated movie , fact , change way we'll watch films now ? just 10 minutes into film , i realized answers these questions " yes " , " yes " , " ultrayes " . never before i seen so much emotion animated film .... or even live-action film . finally someonetook advantage medium create work art surpasses quality , craftsmanship , action-packed beauty lively live-action films . there layers . indescribable layers depth . characters , each change frame , each bit dialog , every aspect film seems symbolic -- bleeding effortlessly into each other , into diaphragm american dream . gong creativity gonged . beacon lit . how much longer fiery firesflame ? world we live today , it important films such " my little poney : princess promenade " made . so many others said it better , yet it seems no one able say it all . perhaps it best quote movies final lines ?

early summer not ozu greatest film , it merely my personal favorite . reason simple : noriko mamiya , played incandescent setsuko hara , one most fascinating , perverse , peculiar female characters all world cinema . every viewing early summer peels away new layers her guilelessness , revealing more more quiet audacity . noriko lives her brother ( koichi ) , his wife , her elderly parents , her brother bratty young sons . she dresses simple western styles works typist . koichi imperious man old-fashioned ideas role women , he intimidates whole family . except noriko . not she ever defiant towards him , she simply mastered art smiling deferentially continuing her own inscrutable path life . her family , friends , neighbors , professional associates all take note her age ( 28 ! ) begin pester her getting married before it too late : noriko smiles deferentially every suggestion , insinuation , or act coercion . there even some speculation she might lesbian . one member her family unable advise noriko , shoji , her older brother who . i . . since war presumed ( any reasonable standard ) dead . ozu master evoking what out frame , continually reminding us there unseen world interacts what he allows us see . absent lovingly remembered shoji turns out force points mamiya her groom , man who unites family his absolute unsuitability noriko . my favorite scene , noriko denies her friend aya she love her intended -- then describes her exact feelings him words perfectly define phenomenon love . new subtitles donald ritchie only times preferable ones older prints . one hand , bawdiness some dialogue much more clear ritchie translation , but other hand titles become far more prosaic . sadly , two best lines film all poetry sucked out them this version . i give you original translations , you read ritchie yourself . when koichi finds his two sons abusing loaf bread , translation his outburst used read , " don't kick food ! " lastly , when two elderly mamiyas share sandwich park , they see toy balloon floating off into sky . perfect distillation yasujiro ozu ability draw our attention what off screen , husband line dialogue used , " somewhere child crying .

not many films classified both artistically seminal expression national ( or societal ) self , but this particular movie just . not only caligari first really great horror movie , it also one first make its horrific point clearly logically . this way it precursor all horror films since -- or should i say all good horror films . moreover mise-en-scene so radically conceived consistently followed through there not moment it not repay close study . glib comments german expression this film no harm , but they don't get anywhere near finely wrought complexity characters their circumstances . film dated 1920 , very beginning weimar republic furious outburst artistic activity occurred during troubled 12-13 year period which ended take-over hitler his nadsp . caligari expression expressionism all right , but it also declaration who what weimar . other words this movie much political statement artistic intellectual freedom it simple horror flick . see this film enjoy it : that first requisite any artistic work . but don't see it once . see it many times . fun it : try find right angle instance . end , you come conclusion not one frame carelessly placed , not one character miscast , not one moment sheer horror left stand its own . this great filmaking . it also great expression freedom . no film this sort could made anywhere other than germany this moment ; it unique expression optimism died nazis	1
i fond memories this 1969 film because way i first happened see it . when my father stationed japan we would opportunity every couple months go see late show base theater . movie screened never announced ; you just went took your chances . one time it " one more time " ( peter lawford plays lord sydney pepper sammy davis , jr. charlie salt ) time it " beneath planet apes " ( i guessed movie basis opening shot waves coming ashore ) . one night we went movie starts off bunch confederate soldiers waiting attack then comes john wayne leading union cavalry charge we got see " undefeated " weeks before its normal rotation our theater . actually , john wayne not best part this film . opening scenes deal end civil war . wayne plays colonel john henry thomas , whose men followed him texas fight union not sick soldiering ready go home . plan they going put together herd wild horses sell them representatives mexican government , who offering best price . course , mexico might its own civil war . meanwhile , defeat confederacy arrival northern carpetbaggers convinced colonel james langdon ( rock hudson ) his men there nothing left them south . so his plan lead his men their families mexico serve military government emperor maximillian trying hold onto power . two groups former enemies meet way after fighting indians together achieve something rapprochement , mainly because rock duke manly men hit it off . they two big stars acting together , rock upstaging amiable duke just every opportunity . idea what expatriate confederates during after civil war interesting one , but script only deals means setting up rest film . course since former confederates traveling women ex-union soldiers only brought horses , romantic subplots involve overlooking minor past differences war killed half million americans . colonel langdon sister-in-law ( marian mccargo ) grudgingly sparks john henry , despite fact his unit shiloh where her husband killed . but it hard pay attention any notion mature relationship when young charlotte langdon ( melissa newman ) , colonel daughter takes interest blue boy ( l.a. rams quarterback roman gabriel ) , john henry cherokee indian adopted son , which not sit well her beau , lt . bubba wilkes ( michael vincent before he jan-michael vincent , i swear i not make up " bubba " name ) . nfl player , then relatively unknown merlin olsen , plays corporal little george , gentle giant gets fight honor confederacy time time . you also see former miss america lee meriwether colonel langdon wife veteran character actors ben johnson short grub , harry carey , jr. thomas ' riders , royal dano dignified confederate officer . this really 3.5 star movie . it not good i remember there all sorts problematic elements film simply because " undefeated " pretty much doing things numbers . there no big surprises here once you know players it simply question watching it all play out . end i round up simply because scenes wayne hudson , without getting into fascinating sub-text personification american machismo acting opposite biggest hollywood star closet . i seen some evidence duke knew rock secret , but there nothing film suggest it bothered him	1
if you dylan fan don't own this , then run out buy or order now . this not missed . don't look back , shot d.a. pennebaker ( who almost missed chance shoot document , actually , when partner , leah approached albert grossman , dylan manager ) see if they would intresed touring dylan shoot documentary . leah said , " who bob dylan " when pennebaker returned he flabberasted , but thank god all , stubborn grossman returned contract or deal hashed out over hotel napkin ( true story ) . small budget , don't look back lean , mean production what tour really , but it not all sex , drugs , rock ' roll . hardly . fact , it shows dylan coming terms his own fame how he negotiates this how he negotiates his way through reporters , various interviewers ( one famous scene ' science student ' who dylan toyed game cat mouse , who he asked , " why should i want know you ? what could you ever me ? " time , maybe dylan right . it would turn out , our young ' science student ' went form chrysalis records , so bit mistake - dylan lacked some prescience here . here we see dylan thoughtful , philosophical young man - so many terrific scenes here , including meeting wtih donovan , who running theme joke through film ( tidbit imformation , it donavan , baez dylan who wrote cards you see subterranean homesick blues night before hotel room - better cards donovan because he more ' artistically inclined ' according many reliable sources ; regardless , cards all three ... ) . don't look back first " rockumentary " real form ever , pennebaker should applauded rewarded . opening scene simply dylan holding his cards music subterranean homesick blues , what today we would call music video - pennebaker first open film this style . dlb broken down into sections essentially ; we see dylan concert , dylan hotel rooms frinds , notably baez bob neuwirth who his constant side-kick ( would change 66 ); scenes traveling , scenes green rooms , footage fans some towns . but that it : travelperformancehotel roomsinterviewsgreen roomssome country ( though not much ) . i don't want give away too much . perhaps one other compelling reason buy this version it includes book all text dialogue every single shot film which excellent true dylanologist or writer or journalist . buy it . then buy eat document , which folliwng year note diffrence year makes . this book , if you like dylan , then positively you . sadi ranson-polizzott	1

i love criminal intent because it take unique view crime stories , not just cops but also gets inside victims suspects . it gives you opportunity look crime point view consequences circumstances actions . i love interaction partnership goran eames watching their partnership grow . i wish they would released season two before season three	1
what this movie lacks plot , it makes up visual special effects . i think hype williams took lot criticism conducting this movie like lengthy music video but i think it actually movie strong suit . likewise , i think while movie might not up par " great " gangsta flicks like godfather or scarface , it wisely not try emulate them either . i also liked all-star hip hop cast/cameos such method man , t-boz , nas , dmx , etc . also , i've hooked some movie film like d'angelo " devils pie " acapella version " however you want me ? " finally , though not fully developed , i think director attempts convey message self-improvement hip-hop community which i think commendable	1

i love this movie - makes me wish i born 20 years earlier - when sexy women still called " dames , " styles hair dress classy all way . music best best - this stuff really influenced jazz today - ray eberle smooth vocals , vocal jazz quartet - lets not forget tex benneke ( he hip cat playing tenor sax doing those cool vocals - god , my kingdom zoot suit ! ) . humor priceless , glenn miller actually could act . final number , " kalamazoo " , makes ya wanna get out your chair find someone jitterbug . get this movie get out your saddle shoes :	1
i seen few " angry young brit " movies late 50 early 60 lately . " this sporting life " , " look back anger " , " saturday night sunday morning " leave picture society offers little except tedious life limited rewards . richard harris character " this sporting life " least opportunity reach beyond but he ultimately reminded where he belonged . these movies left me wondering why british life era seemed so incredibly boring while america things really hopping . beatles changed all but then watching " fully monty " gave me impression deadend life returned . it hard get excited all this dreariness but i'm certain directors point make . maybe it dickensian version " youth served " motto . anger , fighting , drinking , love/hate relationships women all portrayed life without joy . personally , i thought " saturday night sunday morning " best lot . although albert finney might slight notch below richards burton harris , i felt his more compelling character ; lost , aimless , but not willing take it sitting down . he seemed care no one but himself ( common trait leading men these movies ) ready sacrifice just anybody keep his life least somewhat enjoyable . burton just plain angry harris obsessed his game but finney used people around him pawns his own entertainment . one those individuals played rachel roberts who played same sort role " this sporting life " . some movies make you happy some make you think . this limited genre film seems make you think you'd happy watch something else instead . yet there life must lived society predetermined where you belong . these movies may impress many viewer i admit acting directing superb all three movies i cited era . however , i came away each one gladder than before i spent those years middle america rather than great britain .	1
if you love romance movie you see this one regency period atmosphere , costumes , settings , beautiful musical score , excellent performances well-chosen cast . it pleasure watch longtime devoted admirer jane austen works , i am very critical any movies based upon her novels , but this one very best adaptations any major literary work .	1
when i considering buying this film , i read all reviews though alot them negative , i decided get it anyway because i am huge fan jane austen books like bbc movies . i very disapointed after watching it ! this one worst movies i seen . i could not believe it ! music much modern time period , they made movie much too creepy , whereas book much more lighthearted , though there some dark parts it . if you're considering buying this , i would advise against it . i hate negative , but watching this movie waste time .	-1

this offbeat story modern day cowboy who falls love minor eventually tries take her away her father . although story centers around relationship harlan ( edward norton ) ( tobe ) evan rachel wood , several other relationships come sharply into play . family dynamic tobe , her younger brother lonnie ( rory culkin ) , her father ( david morse ) , relationship harlan develops lonnie . this film offers realistic , if odd portrayal life . harlan likes think himself cowpoke , making his way ranch ranch , when actually he stuck suburbs san fernando valley working gas station attendant . tobe angry teenager who meets falls love older harlan , against her father wishes . what results beautiful , sometimes almost corny , film relationships , reality , fantasy , how thin line good bad sometimes . if you like independent films actually deliver , theis one you . down valley gives viewers what more movies should : something they haven't seen before . dvd , interview director david jacobson star/producer edward norton provides some insight into writing actual creation film	1
movie " extreme ops " which opened lukewarm reviews even more lukewarm box office really should carry government health warning it . it so mind numbingly incoherent lackluster one feel your brain cells depleted one one after each comic strip moment . let me take back because equate comic strips this piece drivel disservice comic strips . this movie no plot no characterization . point appears display some " amazing " stunt work but effect spoiled over usage truly obvious computer generated effect work would not look out place your home play station . plot , i use term loosely , concerns group commercial filmmakers who travel world attempts catch stunts film . they hired japanese businessman catch shots skier racing ahead avalanche ( reason why never really given ) so this ragtag group heads austria . why they made decision film shot alps instead perfectly good rocky mountains similarly never explained , except it allows them come into contact sneering serbian war criminal fresh faking his own death . understandably sneering villain none happy sharing his mountain hideaway obnoxious group teenagers . he , like theater audience , seems find them just annoying we , but whereas we liberty tuning them out or , even more sensibly , walking out middle movie , he takes more homicidal approach decides away them . i usually try find some good points movie i review so it somewhat balanced , however it hard this flick find something positive say , i guess one could point out girls good looking scenery equally pretty - count ? yourself favor give this miss . i would also recommend you pass it when you see it dvd shelves . there absolutely no redeeming feature this dull , dumb movie	-1

" fair foul , foul fair , " say three witches _macbeth_ , principle holds true film _shampoo_ . released 1975 , one leading members what now called " 70s films , " _shampoo_ story george roundy , hairdresser beautiful sun-blessed city angels . perhaps no other film hollywood placed into more capable hands -- hal ashby , remarkably disciplined but expressive director ( roundy rides his motorcycle through hollywood hills ); robert towne , veteran screenwriter who won oscar _chinatown_ ; warren beatty , one hollywood greats , swordsman renown . film follows roundy he enjoys what he seemingly enjoys most , company women , he seeks start business , his own hair salon . but film , three witches say _macbeth_ , fair foul , foul fair -- which say _shampoo_ , roles reverse appearances deceive . roles reverse central characteristic roundy -- his enjoying company women . roundy world , courter changed courted , courted , courter . why it , or even whether it must or ought perhaps fit discussion -- but it seems hard argue , this reviewer , traditional role guy courtship courter , traditional role woman , courted . roundy world , however , things somehow got reversed . he no courting -- he doesn't stop his movement seeing angelic brunette walking down sidewalk chase her down , he doesn't time his exit bank catch arresting blonde her way out . he no courting . it women who court him . he walking into his shop woman slams her brakes bats her eyes his attention , he waiting one his " friends " ( most likely how he'd introduce her someone ) her house , while he killing time , her daughter comes him . so roundy world , things got themselves reversed . cause reversal significant important understanding roundy . roundy very existence you might say " half free-will " -- half free-will because nearly any matter , he only forced make half decision . constantly courted , he essentially offered decisions approval or rejection . constantly sought-after , half his decision-making process completed him . his life thus whirlwind -- observer point view , he might seen things roundabout fashion . so he ends up sex young daughter , lorna ( played carrie fisher ) , one his friends . how such thing happen ? because he only ever forced make half decision . yet lorna courting him , which she vigor , there lesson well . she comes roundy saying , " wanna ---?" this roundy agrees . however , when one his friends courts him indirectly asking him fix her hair , he turns her down . so lesson seen here , well , roundy thousand one offers any one time , he takes most direct most clearly communicated . thus roles reverse _shampoo_ . but appearances deceive well . perhaps appearances deceive no better way film than manner roundy forced act order start his business . roundy secretly his own master whose altar he must kneel before -- bank . seeking start his own hair salon , he must courting . he must go bank apply loan . it he who doing approaching , it he who conforms standards his master demand him . indeed , no longer it one his friends who putting just right top or just right perfume roundy approval , but it roundy who putting just right jacket putting his raffish hair just right place approval his master -- bank manager . tellingly , he invites none his friends him bank -- he aware his reversed role , he doesn't like it , but there nothing he it . denied his first attempt loan , he must later go see banker , lester ( played jack warden ) . lester husband one roundy friends . here too appearances deceive -- lester believes roundy gay , so lester would quite shocked learn roundy enjoying company his wife . indeed appearances may so deceive this world end deception itself . end _shampoo_ often seen bleak despairing -- roundy shock only person he decides he trust , leaves him , breaks his heart . but roundy heartbreak forever ? it hard not look few months into future see roundy motoring mulholland drive his motorcycle , friend his speeding up beside him her car , flagging him down , smiling devilishly out her car , asking him if he wants --- , roundy suppressing smile , glancing around . glancing what ? nothing . roundy shrugging , then roundy off his motorcycle tailing behind girl her car , already mended , or if not mended , least forgotten -- maybe ! hope ! -- his heartbreak	1

i bought this set rather impulse . i couple " secret agent " dvd love them ( watched , loved , " prisoner " my teens ) . so , knowing those great , surely danger man great too . it , though much different way . i'm watching disks order , so i'm only little ways , but i've enjoyed almost all stories so far . they're bit campy , ( though less so than later series ) ( reviewer noted ) sometimes bit rushed , but generally well written good production values . pat mcgoohan always great . guest actors bit more variable ( few dodgy accents , tendency put ' dark ' make-up anglo actors make them pass indians north africans)but most good job . it especially interesting , first disk or two , see how writers producers ( actors ) gradually settled , making subtle changes they went . ( first couple episodes , they seemed want avoid setting stories any ' real ' places , so they simply avoiding naming them -- leading some bizarre dialogue ' why you visiting our country ? ' ' where you learn speak langauge this country ? ' eventually they apparently decided just make up countries , so we get wide assortment imaginary eastern european , middle eastern latin american locales . ( where , course , everyone speaks fluent english accents . ) looking forward watching more . so why only 4 stars ? least one episodes unwatchable , lots freezing break-ups . , while i suppose i shouldn't complain given price , complete lack extras frustrating . there aren't even any subtitles .	1

this not " war film " it not " antiwar film . " what malick ( former philosophy student ) * use * setting modern warfare way communicating essence schopenhauer metaphysics ethics . underneath surface observable , individuated phenomena , essence world : non-individuated , passionate yet pointless destructive striving . embodied nick nolte , who lives fight win , while recognizing his way way " nature . " " look those vines , staros , swallowing everything . nature cruel . " true insight into nature , however , leads compassion suffering others , since we all one behind appearances , renunciation desiring ( its inevitable concomitants , conflict suffering ) . denial represented jim cavaziel . according schopenhauer , if one recognizes futility willing but cannot achieve this state complete ascetic denial , only other alternative mitigate one own suffering keeping one expectations low possible . this stance embodied sean penn . first , crucial dialogue penn cavaziel , agenda film placed before us : given world it , should we cling this world despair , or should we turn away it transcend ? penn says , " there no world but this one . " cavaziel replies , " i've seen world . " * * what film : choice mysticism nihilism . film not pro-war , because it assumes schopenhauer , moral justifications war always nothing more than rationalizations more fundamental need violence . film not anti-war , because unlike all other anti-war films , it not set up contrast morally praiseworthy form ordinary life morally repugnant form activity created creating war . if war expression cruelty nature , or reality itself , moral judgment it makes no sense --- one might well condemn jungle jungle . this goes some way toward explaining peculiar detachment film aspires achieves . catastrophe characters caught up world itself , film offers no adequate response it than serenely transcend it	1
cary grant . audrey hepburn . hidden megafortune . three nasty pursuers . slick , chic thriller hitchcockian edge . kind formula , it not surprising " charade " deserves every shred praise it receives -- over years , this classic received lot . director stanlet donen his finest moment when he created this funny , witty , tightly-plotted little thriller , where you're left questions right up final scene . while vacation ski lodge , regina lampert ( hepburn ) decides get divorce . but when she returns home , she finds her husband tossed off train -- even stranger , she finds he mixed up gold robbery many years ago . get her mind off her problems , reggie goes out town peter joshua ( grant ) , guy she met resort . but during her outing , she cornered three strange , creepy men -- worst part , she finds joshua may their plot . unsure whom trust , reggie starts digging find out where gold -- then her pursuers murdered one one . she next target ? it sharp , taut little thriller , reminiscent more commercial thrillers hitchcock , though set chic 1960s paris setting , new wave edge . stanlet donen mostly comedies his career , which makes tight plot wry wit this movie stand out even more . movie moving fairly steady pace , one or two dead spots , but mostly just following twisted plot threads . there some really harrowing moments , like regina attacked hook-man . tense finale , lot odd little clues suddenly fall into place , especially murder three thugs . it brilliant piece scripting , even if storyline bit unreal . fortunately it not all spy-thrills revenge . donen could change action horror comedy moment , he keeps quieter moments lively funny dialogue some sophisticated slapstick , like grant showering fully-clad . witty dialogue full glorious one-liners . " you won't able lie your back awhile , " reggie quips , " but then you lie any position . " though grant wasn't wholly comfortable playing opposite hepburn , two actors kinetic chemistry . whether they're goofing off , or chasing kiss nightclub , they feel entirely real romantic . better yet , nobody knows who grant really or what he doing , so there added element danger their relationship . content quality , criterion collection version undoubtedly best , since film lovingly restored every way . however , it also walletbuster . less expensive but equally restored version , try double-bill " truth charlie " " charade , " just forget you remake all . this tightly-plotted , fast-moving thriller deserves well-loved it , cinephiles should ashamed themselves if they haven't yet seen it . must-have	1

you either love movie or you don't . if you're vod lover , special edition 2-disk release worth every cent . film beautifully restored its " color de luxe " panavision widescreen glory . ( my vhs tape barge making its way staten island landfill i type this ) . second disk includes karioke renderings songs several documentaries featurettes ( all listed above ) . my favorite these " jacqueline susann valley dolls , " which generous film clips depicting chain-smoking failed-actress-cum-bestselling-author speaking herself coming across , more than anything , highly committed indefatigable professional writer ( who used different color typing paper each her six drafts manuscript ) . it easy see how this no-nonsense , get-it-done schlockmeister got under skin procratinating perfectionist celebrity syncophant truman capote . ( i surprised see no mention their long-standing public rivalry anywhere among dvd extras . ) missed opportunity among all extras commentary track disk one . it great barbara parkins ( although her memories seem grown rather dim over years ) . one would liked hear patty duke ( or even leigh grant ) well , though we only guess why fox wasn't able make happen . but commentary could greatly enriched if fox nixed use gossip columnist ted cassablanca ( who stole his nom de plume gay character novel ) engaged truly informed movie critic or film historian co-comment ms parkins . casablanca badgers parkins " dish " other actresses , sharon tate murder , judy garland walking out helen lawson role ; when he not badgering , he cooing her perfume or comparing notes her which actors film they each found " do-able . " ( parkins just closed her eyes during her love scenes thought singer cat stevens england . ) both parkins casablanca surprisingly ignorant basic facts film . i found myself frequently shouting tv screen , " watch disk two--it all explained there ! " among things i still don't understand : why so many people dimiss or discount hayward performance merman-inspired helen lawson ? hayward comes solidly out " women picture " tradition seems perfectly cast . her singing voice , supplied veteran big-band singer margaret whiting ( that mrs. jack wrangler you , ted casablanca ) , perfect match ( raw years backstage smoking ) . but , only explanation i come up ms garland fans so much wanted see her singing role they shun hayward performance out perverse loyalty garland . ( garland died two years after release vod , perhaps adding degree fierceness her fans ' loyalty . ) special edition dvd overemphasizes camp cult elements movie ( " bouncing ball " karioke rendering lawson " i'll plant my own tree " really red wig ends up cartoon toilet final sustained note song ) . such thing make fun viewing once . but movie , movie delicious treat lasts forever	1

review cover dvd reads " snappy , sexy thriller ... " i must disagree . this most unsexy , unthrilling movie i've seen long time . my opinion ashley judd doses not fit this roll , it almost comedic . twisted poorly written losely held gether okay acting . seems actors doing best they could what they . i no doubt producers director felt story potential but they failed realize this production . film ending holds interesting twist but too many lose ends left viewers imagination . my vote ? just okay , nothing write home	-1

i thoroughly enjoyed phenomenon , which i found unusually graceful , warm , genuine movie . sure , it flaws , one could take issue variety departures reality . but characters genuinely care each other dialoge behavior carefully reflect . i didn't try take it too seriously , i fell love george , dr. , lace . george genuinely cares his friends . dr. , played wonderfully great robert duvall , understands people , lace over top sexy ( like some jewish women i known ... sedgwick jewish name ? ) i thought writing great . how george teaching nate portuguese language ? marvelous ! little details cinematography very well this picture . kudos writer , director , guys behind cameras . added bonus soundtrack , which throughly enhances movie every turn . well . my final comment absolutly true - i could watch this movie hundred times . i'm remodeling house , i play it background some days , so i've already seen it least dozen times . many thanks	1

i actually think this 2001 low-budget , indie film quirky charm that hard resist , credit goes director/writer/editor brad andersen singular filmmaking style . it ostensibly contemporary love story two misfits , but he laces plot science fiction elements seem contrived first until they start affect characters tangibly . irony these far-fetched plot developments what make movie resonate emotionally . two people center ruby weaver , single woman unfortunate track record enabling men meet her lowest expectations , sam deed , stranger dubuque who may either mentally ill or time traveler year 2470 . ruby immediately drawn sam sincerity but when he confesses coming future , she inevitably feels like she recycling old behavior trying save him his delusions . it reminds me bit john carpenter 1984 " starman " ( where alien takes form woman dead husband ) touch hal ashby 1979 " there " ( where insulated gardener tries make sense world around him ) . however , anderson puts his own idiosyncratic stamp movie making sam seemingly insane assertions credible ruby attraction alternately frustrating empathetic . acting two leads helps considerably here . suffering premature oscar ejaculation , marisa tomei slowly recovered her acting credentials , this performance among her best she dexterously brings out all hesitation vulnerability ruby . sam , vincent d'onofrio tempers his trademark intensity genuine sweetness makes his child-like wonder believable . holland taylor effectively tones down her sassy persona play ruby impervious therapist , while tovah feldshuh grounds film warmth sensibility ruby mother . ending clever nice use stop-motion photography , even if it felt slightly derivative legendary " star trek " episode where bones stopped saving peace-loving missionary ( played joan collins , all people ) killed . this one more infectious than you may assuming set-up	1

i completely love this movie . i seen it television i knew i going get copy . it amazing feel good movie ! buy it	1
this workout really good my opinion . it very squat-intensive . reasons i like it : - although when you first watch it , it seems simple rather slow , it really kicks your butt . reason kicks your butt because all squats other moves require lot leg strength . she good job engineering weight bearing moves aerobic fashion - quite feat , i think . - moves simple easy follow . she good showing them you first giving you warning before change . - even though moves simple , it still fun challenging . - it nice long cardio workout . sometimes i skip this section middle not terribly aerobic ; even skipping sculpting routines end , aerobic part comes 45 minutes , i believe . - ab section quite good . it 13 minutes long . - i believe she only miscounts once . - there really only one time , i think , where camera cuts during transition or new move .	1

this brilliant series . when i first received it , i watched one every evening friends found myself spending my days looking forward next episode . films very well-made , well-written , thoroughly captivating . kieslowski take each commandments often completely unexpected always intriguing . i can't recommend this series enough . well worth money	1
i , too , mesmerized this disc -- not just music , which indeed hypnotic debussy-to-messiaen strain , but entire production fascinated me . those ravishing images -- pilgrim boat , upshaw final " apotheosis " ( right word ) reflecting pool -- say what you peter sellars mozart , or whoever long gone , but here our troubled century , vision perfect . stength this video , i am trying plan trip paris see premiere saariaho next opera , adriana mater -- also libretto malouf staging sellars . this definite proof opera still viable medium	1
" butch cassidy sundance kid " one best films ever made fox recently released fitting two disc dvd edition film . fitting because dvd one best i ever seen . directed george roy hill written william goldman , god screenwriters , " butch cassidy sundance kid " stars paul newman , robert redford katharine ross . how could film this pedigree anything but good ? what you may not realize , or know , this film made robert redford star he today . paul newman , already established star appeared " hud " , " cool hand luke " " hustler " , among others , bankable star film made because he agreed make it . initially , he wanted play sundance kid , but eventually settled role cassidy . robert redford not new film , but he nowhere near icon he would become . he some early success which followed few clunkers . pair became match made heaven would go appear more films together . screen , they appear friends , much like their characters , this adds charm their relationship . redford clearly recognizes influence this film his career . his famous film academy film festival named after his character film . butch sundance decide rob mail car train owned powerful rail baron . butch tired work wants retire , but he needs one or two big scores set him up . after blowing up rail car , they run off loot hide out small town , brothel they frequent . meeting up rest their gang , they quell revolt decide one more job . they rob same mail car same railway , its next run through area . it perfect crime , no one would suspect same train robbed , so it probably loaded money . after blowing up car second time , they notice locomotive speeding towards them crew men horseback alight car give chase , chasing butch sundance , their two accomplices , days , across many terrains . finally , they realize rail baron hired famous indian tracker help band men , including former sheriff who now famous bounty hunter , catch duo . after chase , they return home ella ( katharine ross ) , sundance kid girlfriend . tired , they decide leave country travel bolivia begin robbing banks there . i watched this dvd " butch cassidy " , two things quickly became apparent . this film virtually timeless . lone exception song " raindrops keep falling my head " , film could've made yesterday , images so clear . second dvd print one most beautiful transfers i ever watched . cinematography conrad hall ( who would later work " american beauty " among others ) simply stunning brings out all rich detail landscape . everything crisp clear , when it supposed , colors bright vivid , it just beautiful watch . it doesn't hurt stars two most handsome men ever appear film , prime their careers , one most beautiful women ever co-star . how anyone get past all eye candy ? key becoming fully invested this film william goldman screenplay . he introduces characters action , we learn we go , they almost always moving , or doing something . goldman fills their mouths witty dialogue , showing us how their relationship works , they instantly likeable us . this basically love triangle ross ' ella playing go-between . two men very close friendship , enjoying each other company . but cassidy loves ella well , even appears slightly jealous until he realizes his friend recipient this woman love , so they get . then , there famous chase . railway baron men chase butch sundance days , taking up significant chunk film . but this scene proves us how committed two men each other makes their future trek bolivia all more believable . we believe there real threat these men never let up chase , if they catch butch sundance , they killed . soon they reach bolivia , goldman lot fun characters again , exploring their relationships , rebuilding them way , making them light hearted again . it almost amazing watch this film because if studio executive presented same screenplay today , it would probably not made . it doesn't hit plot points pre-determined pages , it tells unconventional story , we never actually see villains . goldman luxury writing this film during period which studios still able work somewhat unconventional screenplays . course , they wanted make money well , but they still considered film art form . george roy hill underappreciated director . i think large part this because many his films very humorous . comedy not highly respected hollywood drama , even though making good comedy much more difficult . so i suspect humorous elements most his films made him less respected hollywood , but when your films good " butch cassidy sundance kid " " sting " , you deserve some respect . he made his share duds , but when he passed away few years ago , hollywood robbed talent ready make least few more classics . during this period , big screen westerns becoming unpopular . perhaps dearth television westerns keeping public out theaters , but this genre considered risky time . recent films starring burt lancaster others failing light box office fire . second disc contains new " making " feature including interviews newman , redford , ross , former studio executives david brown richard zanuck more . zanuck reveals he took real chance greenlighting this film , but fought it all way . he also haggled hill filmmakers , attempt keep budget under control ; he became concerned when film projected cost $7.5 million ( consider average studio film now costs least $125 million ) . but film would go big hit . such huge hit filmmakers followed this equally popular " sting " . second dvd also contains some archival interviews stars , some trailers more . " making " documentary , they discuss inclusion song " raindrops keep falling my head " . people fought against it but hill composer burt bacharach felt it would perfect accompaniment scene butch ella riding new-fangled bike through her barn yard . it work , but it clearly not fit period depicted film , most dated element within film today . it just seems silly today . " butch cassidy sundance kid " superlative example treatment all classics should receive dvd . this film every dvd library should	1

this just okay , " one-view " film . it beautiful look , so i wouldn't deprive anyone chance view it . but it not film you'll happy own , my opinion . this especially true if you're into bdsm scene yourself . my problem it ? it too shallow -- all costumes performances need flashy . this film actually intended " shock " but it rather surburban . i hate tone " let go check out leather-costumed weirdos . " it rather condescending exploitative , actually . story young man sent undercover investigate " scene " who predictably ( unrealistically ) becomes involved domina played lovely turner ( who some viewers may remember ball cap wearing lesbian girl go fish ) . all characters utterly without substance , paper thin , portrayed very stereotypical fashion . s/m underworld treated over-glamorous flashy way , emphasis again costumes make-up stage performance . this might actually work better broadway musical , like john water " hairspray . " if you want see sensitive heartfelt portrayal s/m , check out japanese film " moonlight whispers . " there , director writer , deeper understanding romantic psychological elements bdsm . film doesn't portray us all like bunch carnival freaks -- media would like believe . so rent " preaching perverted " view once , but buy japanese film " moonlight whispers . " i promise you'll truly love it . it may only authentic , non-exploitative film ever made male submission/female dominance -- so far , it best one .	-1

this movie very good adaptation stephen king story " trucks " king even directed this movie . it concerns passing comet over earth which animates machines including trucks which then go killing spree . trapped dixie boy diner group people including emilio estevez laura harrington who sadly we not see enough movies these days . then you usual car chase , explosions , large body count wholesome destruction roadside diner/gas station . this perfect drive movie which what king mind when he directed it . plus added bonus soundtrack band ac/dc !!! what more could you ask	1

when compared man fire domino you understand this one those movies where average joe life gets flipped upside down when he intercepts very politically , potientially deadly , threatening materials . minute we find ourselves plugged into this man world we introduced several people who keeping tabs him 24 hours day . they wait outside trucks , bugging him , tapping him , questioning him , even picking up satiliete images pin-point his exact location . it gives all new meaning words " overactive paranoia . " but , domino , it related most becuase domino , well , someone normal who evoked change her boring life . this story man who didn't ask his life changed . whihc makes him perfect everyday hero , my humble opinion . enjoy	1
i liked tomcats all its pure cheesiness , then you too enjoy buying cow . it bit far-fetched , but if you're mood mindless entertainment take you away after horrible day work , this flick trick . also , if you like ryan reynolds , he hilarious this . side note other ladies , you get see him naked which always wonderful plus my book . he looks gorgeous ! jerry o'connell character seems very similar his character tomcats , but he still great fun . thing i really liked how they showed jerry o'connell meeting airport girl his dreams his point view well later film , her point view . i thought nice touch . though certainly quite far best movie i've ever seen , price ( found it $5.50 bin wal-mart ) it great addition any dvd collection	1
peter hyams ' remake richard fleisher 1952 narrow margin focuses more atmosphere scenery than it film noir . it make cool , if bit too short , movie . gene hackman loudmouth deputy da desperate get big daddy mob boss behind bars . when shy book editor witnesses mob assassination he treks out middleofnowhere , canada drag her into court testify . problem arise when bad guys show up wilderness blow crap out her cabin . brilliant , rustic car/chopper chase down sheer slopes mountain forest follows . it great scene some cool shots sharp editing . once they reach bottom mountain they find train station board train private cabin . bad guys follow , only they still don't know what their witness looks like . many scenes hiding seeking make up rest movie . it doesn't sound like much but peter hyams ' widescreen photography used max promote sense claustrophobia even quieter scenes dominated sound train charging through dark canadian wilderness . one particular scene monashee station really take advantage ' middle nowhere ' feeling . bruce broughton score kind okay , but nothing loud exciting score he originally created . peter hyams disagreed ( he often his composers ) chopped up broughton work post-production . thus , music movie more underscore much more action-based cues missing . i wish it last longer more scenes train ( coz trains cool ) but , what it , narrow margin tightly wrought thriller gene hackman top form always fun playing older guy suit who still get into fights car chases if it his everyday job . filmed panavision dvd 2.35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen dolby 2.0 soundtrack . though 5.1 would better there still some surround use . r2 dvd universal also better cover art than r1	1

there many surprises this year academy awards . one biggest absence nominations several films , most noticeably this one . containing no sex , no nudity , no bad language , no gore , no grand action scenes , minimal comedy , non-descript sountrack , only several seconds violence , this movie none hallmarks top movie . but top movie it ; it sat atop box office charts month everyone who seen it comes away impressed . this one those movies stands out its inventiveness , its innovative mode storytelling , its twists turns many points plot , ability make viewer empathize all main characters . great movies themes , this movie multiple . first obsession , not necessarily revenge , but also winning , best , what others more . second rivalry . many movies tried show how friendship evolves into deadly rivalry . examples include star wars : revenge sith , gods generals cleopatra . none these job good this movie . neither character , alfred or angiers , good , neither bad . both professionals trying reach top their professions , if this means backstabbing each other , so it . third sacrifice ; everyone sacrifices more than necessary achieve their ends , result all around lost loves lost lives . most impressive aspect this movie its mode storytelling . 1980 , pulp fiction came out introduced circular method showing movie . then came sixth sense 1990 method flashback end redefined entire movie get-go . then there star wars movies ; sequels first then prequels later . now we prestige ; three different storylines spliced together create play time . movie great , dvd good . no extra or deleted scenes , just interviews , explanations special effects , poster art . overall , great watching experience	1
i've watch " green street hooligan " several months ago thought it good movie but this film like rush blood head . " football factory " ultimate head blowing , jaw clenching , white knuckle ride film . this film all elements make up night exciting viewing , though provoking characters , witty dialogue energized music watch boys batter each other . begin theirs tommy , fast approaching 30 not clue what his sad little life , only thing he�s clinging onto next big meet billy bright foul mouthed , bad tempered geezer who lost ability engage his brain long time ago , he�s only comfortable using his fists . rod who stellar performance restaurant , acts perfect side kick tommy , bill farrell perfect gentleman bygone era harris mean-faced leader who could vinnie jones breakfast , plays distant yet commanding leader . but i like young kid who plays zebberdee , scaly living like vermin depths south london , this all credit acting it must difficult play someone who so detrimental society very little redeeming features . credit must given all actors they all deliver stellar performances what must most unglamorous locations . there isn't one performance i would say weak they all hold audiences attention gage us into what they doing saying . i found violence fashion very realistic . " football factory " more than just football , its loyalty , sense belonging this dysfunctional world .	1
first time i ever heard inxs , i watching " friday night videos " somewhere around 1982 . they performed " one thing " live slayed me . i remember dancing like idiot high school swing . years later , i saw inxs salt lake listen like thieves tour . i managed slip up onto mixing scaffold sit right under board almost entire show . perfect view , perfect sound . i amazed how good this band live . later i'd learn it just testament how much they toured , how devoted they fans . i saw them again ( 20 years later - sheez ) greek theater berkeley jd fortune , again amazed how well they sound person . i've seen this concert video number times over years , but finally got around purchasing it couple weeks ago . i've stayed up late watch it , after wife kids go sleep , several times now . they definitely " " this show . michael vocal quality superb , each member band appeared their peak . camera direction editing make it feel like you there , english fans out this world . i've never seen sea people motion way these folks . no wonder band popping . everyone just feeding off each other . this video stand test time . it like watching old doors footage when jim his prime . i don't think i'll ever tire seeing it	1

i this workout once week , over 100 fitness videos i own makes it one most used . it only 19 minutes long , not too terribly tough but i feel it working . i only tried few winsor pilates videos but this one i like most far . mari winsor leads you through this workout joined some her instructors her hollywood studio . she starts side kick series , which includes front/back kicks , bicycle , leg lifts , big small circles , hot potato . then she move into some inner thigh work inner thigh lifts , then you lift both legs up later lowering bottom leg up down , then you finish off scissors . next segment called fetal thighs . you start your legs fetal position leg lifts , then you more leg lifts but knee pointed downward , this followed clams , elevated clams , yet more elevated clams but adding leg lift . entire side kick fetal thigh series repeated other side before you finish out leg beats final stretch . i like this routine , it short point . there times i need short pilates those time crunches days , this fits bill . if you pick one winsor pilates video , this best one my opinion . highly recommended	1
this dvd very educational anyone who pre-schooler . it really helped my son recognize his letters . if you would like education fun dvd your pre-schooler i highly recommend this dvd	1
i going automatically immediately buy this film because it presented mondo macabro , name i learned really respect trust . mm introduced me now half-dozen astonishing films i'd previously never even heard . well , i hesitated buying this because mixed reviews here amazon . so , i rented it first netflix . well , i watched it last night . this movie totally solid , replete suspense , beautiful venues , awesome music soundtrack , some scantily clad women , exotic atmosphere which many us love these european films . there surreal ambience this genre which totally addictive , thus i every mario bava , jean rollin , dario argento film print , most jess franco stuff well . what sometimes lacking plot more than compensated scenery dreamy weirdness . ( i actually like these movies despite common theme murders women , not because them . i realize danger , evil diabolical acts necessary create tension , just dirty harry-type movie . this movie particular , however , only showed two women killed , only one murders graphic . these scenes certify bad guy bad , but they certainly aren't my favorite scenes . i know some fans these movies like spectacular gore . i personally don't enjoy it . ) anyway , i suspect negative reviews this film come people who more into hollywood big productions lots special effects big name actors like bruce willis , steven segal , billy crystal , bambi . if you already determined you enjoy hidden treasures heyday " euro-trash " films ( totally ironic epithet due fact these categorically most artistic films ever made ) , you enjoy this film . it may not your absolute favorite , but you absolutely glad it your collection .	1
my only reservation this program i would liked more circumstances behind sam death . he very influential singer business person , but he also man . may too much certain people stomach . fact program features interviews sam family shows it approved - also mean it whitewash , sanitised public consumption . fine line walk . just like kennedy assassination , one gets feeling there still more told . i believe writer peter guralnick writing book sam if it anything like his books elvis , it compellng reading . great program worth watching whether or not you fan this wonderful singer who may never reached his true potential	1

anchor bay makes some fantastic dvd editions classic horrors , great price . their necronomicon editions evil dead films , well their special editions dawn dead suspira worth every penny . i bit disappointed see this new edition re-animator only because it third special edition , it doesn't contain much others don't ( just one featurette ) . addition limited edition syringe hilighter great idea , it looks really funky . however , inside box dvds standard plastic keep case , which i happen hate . i'd rather cardboard folder packaging than plastic keepcase , which looks so cheap . least cardboard cd cases , you get all over full colour print , without plastic covering . also , there no inserts inside package save single slip cardstock print one side , chapters other . if you want keep higlighter dvd , you keep them both box . it not flip cover dvd box either - just regular box crushes easily . movie , if you fan , remains fantastic . commentary ( which appeared three versions date ) very good - i liked comparing director point view , experiences actors . three principles clearly great time working together , they plenty say making film . there only one special edition bride re-animator i'm aware , i missed getting copy when it released few years ago . now first film released again special edition package , i'm very hopeful we'll see better edition bride than bare bones one currently available . that really most exciting part this new release .	1

this movie probably gets overlooked because title , which seems incredibly dull unimaginative such cool flick . i think it should called quot ; superatomic submarine vs . flying saucerquot ; because what movie really it sounds much more exciting . movie everything fan 50 sci-fi b-movies would want . story unique twist flying saucer theme because this saucer travel under water , you get two classic sci-fi vehicles price one because this flying saucer takes futuristic ( remember this 1950 ) submarine . parts take place inside saucer very creepy . during these scenes , pitch black background cool creepy music used maximum effect . there few funny lines movie , especially ones where hero talking alien who , way , not disappoint those who love cheesy cool aliens their sci-fi movies . i three words b-movie fans : see it now	1

this dvd 3 famous concertos brahms , tchaikovsky , sibelius . beside , it also beethoven " kreutzer " sonata ( rehearsal ) , beautiful capricci locatelli , piece lalo , one kreisler . so , what more you need one dvd ? compare many dvds ( cds ) , i believe oistrakh played 3 concertos above best . like sibelius concerto , this issue much better than ferras or vengerov dvds , better than heifetz or marcovici cds . moreove , sound quality amazing good .	1
this fine swordplay movie directed sammo hung . i enjoyed movie because its mix action , romance exotic locations costumes . fight sequences fast moving fun watch . i especially enjoyed seeing maggie cheung action . romance movie equally strong adds emotional element action sequences often missing other movies . if you don't generally like action movies because all there fighting , you might like this movie . i listened mandarin soundtrack , but spot checks cantonese soundtrack showed it might marginally cleaner . subtitles white part picture , so they can't turned off . however they very clear i didn't notice any quot ; polar bear snow stormquot ; effects subtitles becoming unreadable . this movie i would recommend action fans superhero fans alike	1
book upon which this dvd based come back into limelight post-enron , pos t-t yco , post-refco , post-worldcom , post-adelphia world ethicless business . dvd gets this part book right . like major rich characters this dvd , today ruthless robber-barons , cheat their wives , demean their employees , spend money lavishly conspicuous consumption . but gatsby never gave million dollar party like head tyco . so much similar : no one knows where rich people money coming . everyone assumes there something illegal few people all money poor people pushed further into poverty . but , no one seems doing anything it . when general motors steps away its commitment employee pensions , united airlines , ibm , this book becomes more more contemporary . even more so when executive pay rises double digits every year . tom buchannan , adulterer this classic , would fit right into today business elite . gatsby ( robert redford ) himself mysterious , but , although his background first world war revealed book , it not found film . his background turns out similar many veterans who returned vietnam , or iraq , find rules business changed , most part , there no effective enforcemen t.t he real lesson this dvd wages sin death . gatsby dies case mistaken identity . his death triggered buchannan infidelity . this message america needs see . i watched this film when it came out . but before enron . i rented vhs watched again after internet bubble burst , just like stock market imploded 1929 , shortly after book written , sweeping millions into poverty . time book became popular , thousands people who hoped like gatsby living streets . if they read book during depression they would happy gatsby got what coming him . what you think gatsby when you see dvd	1

top notch acting through difficult subject . loss hope through capture , torture betrayal face brutal circumstances crucible which true honor self sacrifice rise surface . this prisoner war movie , slated release too close 9/11 , finally reached public without fan fare one most powerful depictions honor true humility available today . when some prisoners inspired teach study redeem time sharing their gifts talents , hope finds its way into hearts prisoners once again . they now something live , look forward end work day , their " awakening " causes their captors permit expansion ( espeacially since their productivity increases ) . ultimately , their honorable ways admired ( even if privately ) their enemies , who lack compassion necessary truly honorable themselves	1

i remember these 6 episodes , which famously known " ones without john cleese " . this probably main reason they've never widely televised us . i remember only seeing them once great while , while watching them , i didn't realise cleese wasn't them , because they absolutely hilarious , they just good anything python ever produced . cleese gone , palin jones took over writing , deliberately made long form sketches , i.e. story thread running throughout whole programme . this works brilliantly michael ellis , light entertainment war , mr. neutron . sketch " anything goes " song light entertainment war side splittingly funny . mr. neutron show gets hilarious digs us ( something pythons weren't really known doing ) , michael ellis brilliant one buying ant . i get somewhat annoyed people who dismiss these episodes afterthought , because they stand their own any other python episode . after show ended , jones palin went onto ripping yarns , which many similarities these 6 episodes . i remember taping these 6 episodes while they comedy central , because i afraid i would never see them again . but i dvd now , so i'm ok .	1
if you've never encountered robert anton wilson , skip this dvd buy yourself copy illuminatus ! ( fiction , writen robert shea ) or quantum psychology ( non-fiction ) . if you're already fan wilson work , you're unlikely learn anything new here ; but you'll probably enjoy yourself all same . if , like me , you never got chance met wilson person , this probably close we'll get sitting down chat elderly " uncle bob " . there also random assortment material varying quality earlier his life . my recommendation brief : read some his books first , then leave this video playing your tv you go your daily chores let uncle bob worm his way into your brain	1
probably everyone one favorite movie they consider " their own " because few , if any , their friends share their admiration it . mine this one . i just love this film . it only one out over 5,000 movies either rented or purchased i watched back-to-back nights after seeing it first time . dozen viewings later , it still just good , if not better . it , star t-t o-finish , most entertaining crime movie i ever watched . fan film noir , those wonderfully-narrated crime films ' 40s ' 50s , romeo bleeding right up my alley . i may wrong but believe this whole film simply parody film noirs : outrageous take those movies over-the-top villain ( lena olin , most fascinating female i ever come across film ) , over-the-top characters , action scenes , dialog narration . it wild , fun - albeit sick - ride , not taken seriously ( which lot people then thought it too goofy ) . evidence this film-noir spoof dialog , number fantastic dark-humor lines , many delivered olin . one see this number times catch all humor here . kudos screenplay writer hilary henkin her work . oldman superb its glue holds this unique story tact . his narration , including exaggerated inflection his voice , fantastic . i appreciate american accent this british actor used , too . olin , russian hit- woman mona demarkoff , she one character i guarantee you not ever forget . roy scheider , annabella sciorra , juliette lewis , michael wincott others - cameos dennis farina ron perlman - all deliver great performances lines , well ,.... i said , outrageous . if you love old film noirs , please check this movie out remember it tongue-and-cheek .	1
i loved first two dvds this anime this one continues story effectively gives good backstory rosette , chrono , joshua . ( first two episodes pure flashback which tad annoying , but effective making joshua sympathetic . ) next episode gabriel hound which coolest vehicle yet . last episode standard christmas special focusing azmaria . reason i don't give this five stars it not nearly funny first two dvds , while last episode light az annoys me , watching dub ( i usually check both dub sub . ) satella worst german accent history . i mean worse then asuka evangelion du	1

... if howard hawks proud making this . sure cary grant didn't seem happy playing this part . i can't think any good actor who'd enjoy lured into such preposterous plot which should got sheridan some oscar impersonating one most insufferable bitches screen ( there no shortage , but very few less funny ) although responsibility more lederer disappointing script . this opinion first 15 min . only , since i don't know if it gets better afterwards , but i couldn't stand it any longer : last 5 min ( 15 ) ordeal .	-1
this dvd based bob anderson well-known book same name . it provides solid introduction basic athletic-type stretch , albeit rather dry manner . dvd nicely chaptered ; i've listed chapters ( times given menu ) added my own short descriptions below . getting started , 7:09 . this short educational segment stretching which begins showing people engaged various athletic activities stretches ( somewhat dated-looking ) . bob anderson then comes screen reviews his philosophy stretching . he emphasizes stretching not exercise stretches should feel comfortable all times ; he focuses " easy " " developmental " stretches opposed " intense " stretches . bob also introduces his two models , marlon debbie . neck back stretches , 12:14 . this first segment , bob leads marlon through series very gentle stretches back , mostly reclined position . there no neck-specific stretches , but bob reminds you keep your neck alignment your back . legs , groin , hips , feet stretches , 12:30 . here , bob leads debbie through nice series standing sitting stretches lower body . most stretches held longer duration ( 15 seconds ) , bob also includes instructions massaging your feet , although only one foot demonstrated . upper body stretches , 10:20 . this my favorite stretch segment . starting kneeling moving standing , bob again leads marlon , this time focusing stretches shoulders , neck , torso ; it ends nice upper body twist . everyday stretches ( daily routine ) , 12:29 . this final segment instructed bob alone via voiceover . here , bob includes stretches each above segments form nice full-body routine . however , because there more stretches included , he also moves more quickly through each stretch ; i would liked see some longer holds here . addition , i found music quite distracting jarring , it alternated loud bells/chimes no music all , which i not feel very conducive relaxation . soemthing this dvd didn't really " click " me ; mentioned above , i found it quite dry ( bob barely cracks smile entire time ) thus not very relaxing . however , this solid athletic stretch dvd could very useful someone who looking short stretching routines incorporate into their fitness regimine and/or daily life	1

there number films underdogs world . most them comedies . necessary roughness one them . it how texas state university lost its championship status due cheating , steroids , pay-offs , etc . therefore , entire team expelled tsu . new recruits actual student-body . coach riggendorf ( robert loggia ) said , " mass suicide ! " team made up bunch misfits way-out individual characters . president tsu ( fred dalton thomson ) wanted ed " straight-arrow " gennero ( hector elindonzo ) lead new team . but there catch . dean ( larry miller ) insist applying strict rules ; ie : " no pass , no play . " ( referring their grade-point-average ) so number students try out team . fair batch made it too . but since most players didn't make grade , they kicked team dean . forced them play what called " ironman football " ; where team plays both offensive defensive . not easy feat . also , they needed really good quarterback . so coach rigg enlisted paul blake ( scott bakula ) , who best high-school . sadly , he give it up when his father passed away , take over family farm . tsu armadillos begin some serious football playing against other universities/colleges their area . but some hilarious commentary chuck niederman ( rob schneider ) pressbooth . they even manage get football player/science professor join ( sinbad ); well lucy place-kicker ( kathy ireland ) . all they want achieve football life win least one game . blake wants his fellow teammates feel what he high school - just even once . i find movie amusing even downright funny . cast characters hoot .	1

i believe it observed , more than once variety ways , all life like gigantic mirror . we see ourselves , everywhere . , if we beautiful ( inside , where true beauty lives ) , then we see beauty everywhere we look . life beautiful puts this idea test . it posits carefree , happy-go-lucky book salesman who romances well-to-do lady mussolini italy ( film starts just onset wwii ) . he weds her , they rear child , they soon put into jeopardy due his jewish heritage . ultimately , they sent concentration camp where his carefree , imaginitive unceasingly joyful attitude only things keep him , his son , utter despair . humor ? romance ? carefree ? nazi death camp ? some , this blasphemous . but makers this film , our lead character , life beautiful , this vision taken their perspective . film manages show there joy , love beauty -- even worst imaginable conditions -- testament way which film succeeds , also basic truth message . yes , things may awful ( more often then not , they ) ... but yes , also : life beautiful . this film gets my highest recommendation . five stars	1

this excellent film adaptation excellent play . produced 1958 , it feels fresh , important modern -- minus few anachronisms -- today it then . paul neumann elizabeth taylor star brick maggie , career-defining roles which they received oscar nominations . they supported equally talented cast ; i particularly enjoyed madeline sherwood sister-woman , strident , manipulative matriarch ever-expanding brood " no-neck monsters " . purists note changes made script make movie palatable movie audiences time conform hollywood production code . while it water down things bit , i've seen filmed versions truer source material but lack power depth this adaptation . dvd doesn't come oodles extras , but ones present worth viewing .	1

actually , i thought " penny dreadful " most innovative film after dark horrorfest certainly not worst ( would " hamiltons , " hands down ) . i went whole route " 8 films 2 die 4 , " catching all eight films their first showings each day , buying my tickets advance get free t-shirt , then waiting monster it depicted show up one films ( it never happened ) . films while we got our free pop refills ( i recommend just getting your large drink filled up halfway so you make it all way through movie ) , we would sit around dissect each film make recommendations ( " audition " film most mentioned ) . end festival my impromptu straw poll found " penny dreadful " much support any other film " best show " title would earn one eight general release . we thought they would go " dark ride " most commercially viable bunch , but they ended up picking " abandoned , " which its own uniqueness heroine mature woman twice age title character this film . this third movie second day i should explain we running gag going regarding connection women cars established these films . first day ended " dark ride , " which involved heroine driving mini-van through wall right time right place save day . second day started " gravedancers , " which same thing happened ( i think it suv time ) . followed " abandoned , " which begins ends woman driving giant farm truck . so time " penny dreadful " started we all chuckling fact characters such small vehicle because it just standard car . car question driven orianna volker ( mimi rogers " ginger snaps " ) , psychologist who trying get penny dearborn ( rachel miner " guiding light " ) over her phobia cars . we find out via flashbacks she car accident claimed lives her parents , so she good reason traumatized experience want avoid driving around car again . but orianna taking penny road trip help her get over her phobia . penny stop every gas station way so she puke up her guts then things get worse . when orianna clips pedestrian lonely stretch mountain road she figures least she give guy ride . fact his face obscured hood he skewer meat him not set off alarm bells orianna telling rest us this big mistake ( you seen commercial where guy picks up hitchhiker ax because guy carrying bud light claims it just opener ? ) . now you know full well given this setup orianna going dead penny going face hitchhiker . what you not expect most film going take place little car ( not ask how maniac set up this scenario , just go it ) . point you thinking there not much you given this scenario , but i think you pleasantly surprised . director richard brandes ( " out blood " ) co-wrote screenplay diane doniol-valcroze ( " kill inches " ) . there not lot horror films come up such simple scenario then stick it ( i always think stephen king short story " survivor type " novel " gerald game " examples one note take extreme approach ) . yes , initial requisite bad decision compounded series other fatal errors ( i believe i actually said " drive rims " out loud theater ) , but fortunately this 2006 horror film relies more penny phobia specific situation play out story . given penny phobia i bet you think you know exactly how this movie got end , but ending this movie not go obvious . again , this speaks determination brandes go against expectations come up something different . i certainly appreciated audacity doing slasher film where most action set around car stuck woods . net result not great horror film , if your taste runs extreme gore films like " saw iii , " " wolf creek , " " hostel , " et al ., then this one going seem dreadfully tame . but i pleasantly surprised hopefully most you who decide check out " penny dreadful " dvd feel same	1
it doesn't matter if you watched original , harvey birdman takes all members hanna barbara family brings them modern maturity . fred flintstone mob boss , inch high private eye discriminated work place . classic concepts adult humor only brains adult swim could create . not mention one best theme songs	1
rest stop horrible movie . sure there many killings , some decent amount gore creativity , but doesn't make up bad plotline less than pleasing cast . end alternate ending both make no sense whatsoever , after watching this movie , you'll wonder why u wasted your money how anyone could've thought this good movie	-1
it funny claude rains shot fame " invisible man " when we only see him few seconds end movie . but such power james whales movie . just directed frankenstein mr. whale given free run this project he ever take it run . this still very powerful movie wicked humor it still make you blink quality f/x time . add deep rich voice claude rains you get classic first order . problem none other films live up promise first they really not good , most falling into comedy even if they weren't ment too . still they worth look because first movie belongs beside other monster collections	1

guillermo del toro ( who directed last years phenomenal pan labyrinth ) seems his best when dealing paranormal ; indeed , he uncommon gift making fantastic seem plausible . this film contains some most haunting believable images i've seen screen , their efficacy heightened director understanding when enough enough . ghost stories any kind fail when real or imagined ghost absurdly presented . most today contemporary " master horror " fail miserably . it 1939 , spanish civil war its final days . carmen doctor casares run orphanage boys ( one wonder , why no girls ? ) . institution remarkable feature : middle courtyard bomb , tip which embedded firmly ground . bomb fell sky during raid , but never exploded . it sits there , disarmed yet immovable , reminder violence outside world . carlos , ten year old , left orphanage , though carmen argues they no resources more children , she accepts him assigns him bed number twelve , bed santi slept until day he disappeared , which same day bomb fell sky . carlos , predictably , begins see visions shadows , first , it isn't understood whether these come his mind or if they real . one night , shadow tempts him behind bed curtain , when carlos pulls curtain back , shadow gone . but pitchers water boys ' room fallen their stands break , when other children awaken , carlos jaime each take pitcher refill kitchen . carlos sees footprints spilled water . when boys reach kitchen , jaime pumps water his pitcher , waits outside carlos . carlos pumping , rack scissors kitchen falls makes loud noise . jacinto ( eduardo noriega , open your eyes ) , young caretaker who once orphan himself here , comes investigate . carlos flees down into cellar hide , there he encounters shadow taunted him . he touched his phantom cellar , we see , before anyone else , this image real . it boy , no older than carlos , upper left portion his forehead cracked open , pale , blood seeping upwards if body underwater . after touching carlos , ghost quickly disappears , but voice says , " many you die . " it prophecy demands fulfillmen t.t here gold orphanage , gold carmen casares give those called nationalists , support their cause . jacinto knows this gold , he wishes steal it himself . not only he bedding conchita , beautiful young cook ( jaime wide-eyed crush ) , but he also taking carmen bedmate . it unusual coupling ; carmen principal when jacinto orphan there , she wooden leg she must set aside accept him . ( some small irony there . ) when they partner , jacinto takes replaces one key her large ring keys see if it one open safe holds gold . jacinto , ghost may least their worries . this excellent film , one better appreciated second viewing . i've heard it compared others , but i doubt such comparisons would made if director writer others , alejandro amenabar , not also mexican . while they both ghost stories , they operate under completely different rules . i highly recommend this . 4� stars rounded up five convincing " paranormals " .	1
hbo documentary " you believe miracles ? story 1980 u.s. hockey team " came end mark johnson spoke how 20 players never together same room again after their visit white house , credits began roll up screen they played very moving song seemed wrap up show very happy note . anybody know name artist or song ? i think it may either crosby , stills nash or possibly neil young .	1
i , however , see different version than one listed here . one i saw 122 minutes mandarin subtitles came 2 discs . there some bad cuts some cheesy cgi scenes but overall movie stunning visually . i found story coherent believable fairy tale world presented . touching love story typical broken hearts lies boot . nothing earth shaking but enjoyable	1
yes , el dorado similar plot rio bravo , it stars " duke " directed same director . but , el dorado much tighter leaner script , doesn't contain any dreaded " filler " like rio bravo , nor it woefully miscast ricky nelson . ( it still superior western though)el dorado co-stars much more effective james caan , incomparable robert mitchum spectacular performance . great story , wonderful superb cast , lots great action masterful direction make this " must-see " western . ( " splinters hand " scene seen believed ! ) highly recommended	1

this third mtv fitness dvd i purchased far my favorite . power yoga really hard one my favorite fitness dvd i own . thing i like best this one breakdown upper lower body workouts . i haven't tried 10 minute full body workout but am glad i always option . i work out , weights , yoga 4-5 times week this really hard me first time around . i just finished my second workout today still couldn't finish all reps few exercises . pretty good shape , it hard find dvd challenging enough make me sore feel like i worked hard . if you're like me you love this dvd ! abs main focus throughout both workouts so prepared . since pilates all core makes sense , but my core really talking me after only 15 mns ! i opt upper lower sections back back so my next day just cardio . ready sore after very first time use it ! kristin really good instructor doesn't annoy me like so many others out there . only thing i say she super advanced so prepared look beginning or intermediate people dvd . i am totally pumped this dvd because she incorporates moves i've never seen before which refreshing . bikini season here i come !	1
this my first leslie sansone set , but it certainly won't my last ! this exercise series features walking place , accented different steps- side step , kick , knee lifts , etc . this particular set comes stretchie , long band rubber [ ? ] you use while walking work out your arms well your legs . leslie very motivational , she talks you through whole program , which something i enjoy but some other people may not . she group backing walkers who walk background behind her , they range vastly age- there 70-plus year old man walking , few women their 60s 50s well one her 20s . exercises fantastic- simple enough anyone them , very low-impact easy joints , they require very little space . only complaint i this set background music- it seems kind " off " me it gets boring after while [ it not really music , just keyboard beat some guy saying " walk , power walk " over over again ] . that small concession this fabulous exercise program , though . thanks leslie	1

you might interested this spanish/argentine film because inclusion gael garcia bernal ' motorcycle diaries ' other superb latino-american films . yes , he it , but what more impressive outstanding acting cecilia ross , star ' all my mother ' ( wife fito paez , director ' vidas privadas ' aka ' private lives ' ) . she gives strong acting heroine this very unconventional story . cecilia ross middle-aged carmen , visiting her ailing father buenos aires , argentina . carmen now living madrid , apart rest her family , but film story unfolds , we realize she often looks restless uneasy even though she back home . but carmen more peculiar habit . every night , alone dark room , she listens sounds young couple making love next room . she not eavesdropping or spying ; she doesn't even know their faces , she fact hires ' lovers ' ( including handsome model played gael garcia bernal ) . but why she ? melodramatic story follows fates carmen young model who both attacted each other through their voices , film not crave credibility , giving emphasis upon emotional turmoil unlikely couple , so if you say plot impossible , no one blame you . but those who laugh this apparently incredible chain events , or who wince intentionally ( i think ) exaggerated sound effects piano strings , would miss film point . previous reviewer says , understand film we need keep mind film nature akin greek tragedy , which we mortals all frail erring . behind these all-too-human characters you see ghost atrocious dictatorship argentina , which started late 70s . now it gone , good i hope , but it still torment those who involved , whether oppressors or oppressed . though film cast give unanimously good acting , it cecilia ross who most impressive , times literally dedicating herself character . fans gael garcia bernal would not disappointed , whose character plays crutial role latter half film . just wait while , you see his good performance . similar theme ( sad history argentina ) taken up ' imagining argentina ' starring emma thompson antonio banderas . i didn't think it good , but well , just case you're interested .	1
it nice see two lead characters movie flawed talk , act , react like normal people . even though movie clocks more than 2 hours , it didn't feel long . viewer i looked forward next scene not because i anticipating big revelation plot but because i so taken story i want know why they act way they . movie opens mary mcdonell , who played soap opera diva , hospital oblivious fact she surgery due car accident would make her unable walk . she assisted numerous nurses but all them quit because her not so pleasant attitude . then came alfre woodard , spunky nurse who problem her own . she only one who able handle mary mcdonnel . relationship two women , who living lives they never imagined living , heart soul movie . what i like movie it didn't resort melodrama order tell story full punch . ending not resort quick resolution where both ladies ' problems go away two leads suddenly become best friends . they would probably still face same problems they would still probably fight occasionally , but now they better perspective looking things more important , they now acknowledge how each affect help each other obvious ways not so obvious ways . it low key but beautiful ending movie ended two ladies boat facing each other sunset . grade :	1
if you don't watch this movie due negative reviews then you missing out something ... not something great but pretty good sequel . some people just following what others saying so they won't sound ' uncool ' saying they like it . let rewind minute or two back when this movie came out . i saw this theatres i tell you people jumped during those 3-d shots same way they during friday 13th part 3 3-d ! chewed off arm shark breaking glass , effects not bad all like most would you believe . movie itself , i thought it pretty good . you shark lagoon scary enough . but towards end when you see mother shark tale whip back forth break gate open due force shark strength your imagination let you aleady wonder how big this shark ! you also shark hunter this movie his partner try cage shark up begin . you big name stars like dennis quaid louis gossett jr. joining cast . yes you stereotype ' must ' every shark movie guy/girl relationship , shark hunter , weak character/brother , businessman , etc . there actually many things going this movie my opinion i go into negative things also like anyone else . but bottom line this movie not one , but two big sharks . it also some suspense it like parts 1 2 shark coming up it victim behind . idea big shark swimming around sea undergound see-though glass structure people walking just makes it much better . it not jaws . nothing even close first one . it not jaws 2 many would agree worthy sequel truth they could stopped right there would good set open/close . but if you look jaws 3 something other than sequel judge it it own .. heck , pretend it name like maybe shark attack 5 or something i am pretty sure you think this movie least better than most said jaws 3 . not classic but good saturday afternoon/night movie .	1
2nd this evangelical christian sci-fi thriller series even better than 1st ( i reviewed one , too , if you interested . ) . part its charm its b-movie budget , effects , sets , locations , acting . not read books i still entertained story kept my interest despite its holes , preachiness . acting mostly not-wellknown actors good excellent , made me care good guys , hiss bad . i'm looking forward round 3 . leave any religious bias behind , just sit back enjoy entertaining little film .	1
i first saw " good neighbors " ( 1975-77 ) late 1970s pbs , shortly after show completed . i impressed wit comic timing actors , subtle comedy which didn't hit you over head make point . when they came market vhs format , i decided buy them installments , am very happy i . you likely know story : richard briers plays tom good , frustrated 40 year old draftsman who works plastics company . good his wife barabara ( felicity kendall ) decide " get back basics " thereby tom quits his job , turns yard into huge garden , buys chickens pigs livestock decides become self sufficient , bartering only what they need , etc . not practical life style 1970s suburban london . contrasting their neighbors : jerry margo ledbetter , played paul eddington penelope keith . mr. ledbetter executive plastics company tom good used work ; he crawls grovels boss keep his high paying job , which supports his expensive well furnished home . ledbetter slave his work despite finanicial prosperity ; good doesn't answer boss or schedule , but faces obstacle after obstacle his crops or livestock . chemistry comic timing all 4 principal actors very fine , laughs many frequent . despite impractical plot - no one would get away livestock subdivision anywhere civilized world long - this makes wholesome entertainment . i haven't seen dvd version comparison , but vhs tapes very good quality : clear picture , great camera work .	1

prison martial art/fight movies never seemed work very well me . bloodfist 3 circuit 2 only decent ones i recall , but undisputed 2 far better probably one best made date . michael jai white , highly skilled athletic actor , finally gets lead role film . unfortunately , his character limited boxing champion - not martial arts expert , though white skilled area ( his fight scene universal soldier return against van damme awesome ) . he learn bit martial arts basics however , go up against his nemesis film - played incredible scott adkins . adkins ' character so cool , you almost want cheer him instead . his athelticism fabulous he performs moves his fight scenes incomparable any other martial arts fighters i seen film . he also gets nearly same screen time , equal amount dialouge white this film , allowing his charcater explored too . story typical movie prison scenerio - illegal fighting , russian prison etc etc some guy wants get rich who heads fights . script fact suffer some , but movie progressively gets more interesting . there even happy tender ending , alsmot weird film such profanity such , its kinda cheesy but hey , something nice change . its good see martial art/fight movies still made , there definte audience out there . undisputed 2 great above average film its genre , far better than first undisputed	1

i love these types movies , b/c all reviews this page very thoughtful interesting . i agree most everything , but one thing keeps popping up i disagree idea characters totally unlikable . i personally find characters extremely sympathetic . these people all incredible pain . they miserable . not one single character happy . they all trying medicate their pain , oblivious fact love they all seeking within arms reach , yet they step each other " get theirs " such extent end no one happy . yes , may incredibly bad mother , but she shell person her entire life , practically no joy whatsoever . ditto others . how world these not sympathetic characters ? i lot love my life . course i sympathize those who none .	1

i am curious whether or not any my fellow reviewers ever actually played game ? this movie not made stand its own , it made supplement universe . characters mialee , lidda , redgar iconic characters who known gamers several years . story not really meant tell background characters or how they got together , rather it designed tell part their story , one many adventures group together . personally , i liked movie . yes there only 4 endings but , what you want them ? this first choose your own adventure dvd , fact first choose you own adventure dvd i seen . i watched story 6 different times each time garnering new information yet get forth ending . if one so inclined they could go through movie dozen times still probably not see every scene combination available . people who buy it dissapointed because its poor game , news flash ... its not game . it dvd choose your own adveture story based game . i liked able watch movie recognize mialee casting fireball , or group fighting earth elemental summoned druid . yes it very basic concept game but , thats all it meant . first time shot dark see how people react such concept . anyways i highly reccomend this movie anyone who plays or similar fantasy rpg . just keep it mind this isn't best fantasy story out there but its definatly good start choose your own adventure genre . calsu	1
this movie little known treasure . i remember watching it several times growing up , but nobody else i know ever seen it . real men very difficult find , it never released dvd format until know . i strongly suggest you buy this movie ( especially this price ! ) . it high replay value ( almost like blues brothers ) it keep you entertained years come	1
first all , if you're going see this movie , remember not take it too seriously . it touch some serious subjects , course meant make you think , but above all , it comedy . it silly raunchy fun . don't read too much into i t.t hat said ... this movie great ! if you're fan sarandon , cher , pfiefer , or nicholson , you'll probably like it . if you're fan all 4 , you'll love it . there aren't any oscar-calibur performances here , but you tell actors just lot fun their characters ( which i always find entertaining ) . susan sarandon most fun me , she goes super-dowdy free-spirited sexual . you've got love jack nicholson suave evil only nicholson . plus , cher huge infomercial hair ! combine all kinds weird religious messages , you've got yourself movie	1
i expected hystrionic-filled movie , pleasantly surprised wisecracker oscar levant . he makes film . course , whenever you buy one these joan crawford works , you're going get her flashing , emotive persona , but stiletto-sharp writing beautiful score keep you cringing . it treat front row one several oscar levant / james garfield ( really isaac stern ) piano/violin duets . this film worth investment . you want revisit musical performances .	1
second five pink panther features ( i don't count 1982 trail pink panther since it mainly deleted scenes outtakes cobbled together previous films ) , shot dark ( 1964 ) first actually star peter sellers ( what new , pussycat , party , murder death ) his signature role ever bumbling inspector jacques clouseau ( original pink panther film featured david niven well cat burglar , while seller role clouseau more supporting one ) . produced , directed , co-written blake edwards ( " peter gunn " , party , revenge pink panther ) , other co-writer william peter blatty ( exorcist ) , film includes elke sommer ( baron blood ) , herbert lom ( spartacus ) , george sanders ( village damned ) , tracy reed ( casino royale ) , graham stark ( return pink panther ) , burt kwouk ( you only live twice ) . film begins we see various figures furtively sneaking large , french chateau , punctuated some gunshot ringing out night . we soon learn passionate spaniard chauffeur murdered , housekeeper named maria gambrelli ( sommer ) prime suspect , due fact she found room body , holding smoking gun her hand . it turns out murder occurred estate wealthy businessman named benjamin ballon ( sanders ) inspector jacques clouseau ( sellers ) , mistakenly assigned case , soon makes scene , his assistant hercule ( stark ) ... i say mistakenly given prominence those involved , chief inspector dreyfus ( lom ) , who despises clouseau passion due his bumbling antics , would never knowingly allowed clouseau investigate such delicate case . anyway , clouseau quickly removed investigation but soon re-instated interested parties , reasons unknown , pull few strings his behalf . clouseau blunders his way forward , he convince maria didn't commit murder , she covering someone else , but one wonders if clouseau belief stems fact he quickly falling accused . things go seriously awry clouseau tries various methods determine identity killer , which really only results two thing , first increasing body count various members ballon household suffer deaths unnatural causes , second drive chief inspector dreyfus further further brink insanity . not only , but mysterious assassin loose , intent killing clouseau himself ! things eventually come head once clouseau gathers all interested parties one room , intent expose killer who he surely believes among group . many would say shot dark best among pink panther films , i'd hard pressed argue , but i've always partial pink panther strikes again ( 1976 ) , one where dreyfus , after escaping asylum , threatens destroy world unless effort coerce nations world send their best assassins eliminate clouseau once all . while shot dark may not screwball some later pink panther films , it still extremely funny , entertaining worth most anyone time given strength writing wonderful performances . sellers , well sellers , bumbling , awkward , nincompoop detective who , somehow always manages come out top ( but not without few bumps bruises way ) . it difficult picturing anyone else role after seeing sellers ' performances , but we given opportunity so 2006 release starring steve martin . i yet see new film , but i really no desire so i don't think it live up originals . sellers perfected role , i little interest seeing someone else trying top something i doubt could topped . anyway , sellers helped way great performances herbert lom , clouseau beleaguered supervisor graham stark clouseau unfortunate assistant . throw lot humorous dialogue , goofy situations galore , henry mancini memorable scoring you've got one heck comedic adventure . some my more favored parts film include running gags , particularly one where clouseau dons any number disguises , all which end up him arrested various misdemeanors ( one scene he disguised street vendor selling balloons order follow maria unnoticed , but he quickly arrested he doesn't possess street vendor license ) . great sequence occurs when clouseau tries follows maria surreptitiously into nudist colony , he can't gain entrance until he strips down himself . i've never seen so many carefully place set pieces obscure all naughty bits inappropriate pg rated film . then there various bits clouseau manservant kato ( later films he known cato ) , played burt kwouk , who instructed his employer attack clouseau when he least expects it , if only continually improve his employers ability deal unexpected . finally there finale , clouseau gathers those remaining one room , gets whole lot more than he bargained once revelations begin coming furious pace . all all this terrific murder/mystery comedy , one worth watching more than once . picture , presented both widescreen anamorphic ( 2.35 : 1 ) fullscreen ( 1.33 : 1 ) , looks very clean , dolby digital mono audio , available both english french , comes through clearly . far extras , there eight page booklet , original theatrical trailer , subtitles english french . there also hidden feature , one found clicking title main menu , revealing vintage promotional ad . cookieman108by way , if you don't happen own any pink panther films dvd but interested buying them , look pink panther film collection dvd set which includes pink panther ( 1963 ) , shot dark ( 1964 ) , pink panther strikes again ( 1976 ) , revenge pink panther ( 1978 ) , trail pink panther ( 1982 ) . only one not included within set return pink panther ( 1975 ) , only because mgm somehow lost rights film universal pictures , who release movie onto dvd 2006 ( thankfully ) .	1

there few superhero tv shows - old superman , new superman , spiderman batman cartoons , few others not coming mind right now . flash one my faves when growing up firstly because his cool costume . no tights , just lightbolts , scarlet heavy-duty boots . this tv rendition not unsatisfactory me . interplay 3 main characters well , cheezy comedy added it personality . flash scenes not over or underdone , i remember hearing show cancelled because cost special effects ( those days ) didn't justify continuing program . some villains hokey , but show also puts flash some hairy situations ! if you watch episode more than once , you new appreciation it . $40 22 episodes pretty good deal	1
film restoration work looks sounds magnificent . eddie kramer gets extra congratulations 5.1 audio mix . said , 3rd disc mainly stereo only . karen review below bit harsh . if you actually listen main film commentary , you understand why more footage isn't available : not every second 3 days performances captured . concert films not exist genre this time ( see annoyingly choppy ' festival!' documenting newport ) , so this new territory point film make document gave overall feel event time . pennebaker his crew decide which songs film , which seems predetermined dylan buddy bob neuwirth who more familiar scene than filmmaker . they would turn red light stage signal start filming next song . some times , they didn't plan camera men would shoot their discretion , so some performances may captured only 1 camera therefore considered not presentable . also , film reels would end during performances need changed ( approx every 20 minutes ) , hence footage missing two jimi songs . regarding lack more outtake footage : 1 . your precious janis big brother new manager albert grossman didn't allow them filmed first day , but finally they asked play again next day because crowd reaction desire get something film . whole set could exist but i doubt it . grossman his need control probably blame , it no coincidence woodstock filmmakers also refused use her footage original release . she only appears now directors cut . 2 . byrds set extremely historic , one should included whole if it exists . 3 . who set only missing ' pictures lily ' not counting ' my generation ' which proper film . it bootleg who dvd so why wasn't included inexplicable . i would like seen all footage each artist set put together bonus disc including songs included whole or part actual final film , so it all one place . what we get anything besides what made final cut . 4 . far tiny tim , yes his impromptu performances annoying , but they part just , impromptu candid backstage footage supplied bonus , not part 2 hours bonus footage . so , skip past it like i get over it . 5 . regarding grateful dead , small glimpse seen beginning ' jimi plays monterey ' film , but liner notes 4cd box set 1992 tells us , like janis , band or management refused allow any audio or visuals used . i assume they didn't like their performance , or wanted control it like rest their own vault . whole festival charity , we also learn supplementary interviews , artists therefore sign waivers releasing rights their performances . my guess it dead refused comply . 6 . real shame there no footage lou rawls ' electrifying set , which would also show more diversity genre festival . 7 . charles shaar murray commentary during hendrix film actually quite insightful entertaining . yes , there some funny comments substances clothing . he wrote definitive biography jimi , his commentary well founded gives context why his perfomance festival revolutionary . said , this definitive package , must own release serious rock collector library	1

original version cape fear thrilling its presentation any modern thriller or suspense . it dark mood it , creepiness , requires sense restlessness part audience : all important facets suspense . dark mood film personified within first ten minutes film , we see malicious ex-con max cody ( played robert mitchum ) lurk background court then finally confront man who he seeks revenge , lawyer sam bowden ( gregory peck ) . bowden doesn't immediately recognize cody , this only seems engage his sinister nature even more . bowden , this point , must all he protect not only himself , but his family against this man . perhaps what makes this film work simply mitchum performance max cody . there despicable nature cody , hard-edge persona there viewer see , but there still something else his mannerisms really get under your skin . unlike some outright villains , he not so much open book manipulative temperament . instead raging raising his voice injustices , he smirk his face calm manner while planning plotting , this makes him even more mysterious malevolent . he quintessential bad guy , probably ranks among most despicable characters film history simply because his relentlessness perversion . without giving too much away , if there one blemish , it would seemingly rushed ending film . it somewhat satisfying , but it seemed though there would more tell end . this , however , not take away performances , over all affect film . great movie watch if you want see top-notch thriller ! 4 1/2 stars	1

years ago i saw nicholas cage `8 mm , ' which pretty bad film , leaving some nasty taste my mouth . then someone still remembered this forgettable film , decided re-use title again lure unsuspecting viewers like me . fact , `8mm 2'was originally called `the velvet side hell ' forgettable film absolutely nothing nick cage thriller . apparently film categorized thriller or mystery , but greatest mystery how this kind dishonesty allowed all . film director refers film " sexual thriller . " surely it sexual , but never thrilling . right beginning includes one incredible laughable sexual fantasy courtroom , david , aspiring ( boring ) politician played johnathon schaech so many ridiculous things it impossible believe he could fianc� tish , daughter american ambassador budapest . these lovers stupidly seduced night budapest when one glamorous lady named rita shows up before them . cue obligatory `threesome ' scene . they blackmailed . they search rita who just disappeared . they go further into underworld porno industry city . they deep trouble . we going see just predictable ending not clever filmmakers seem think . [ tedious , so tedious ] actually , earliest stage `8mm 2 , ' tedium settles , so you cannot enjoy film even `so-bad-so-good ' film . film tries stretch poor story more than 100 minutes , which told most thrill-free , by-the-number way , without giving couple any real dangers . film also attempts show psychological changes happening characters , tish particular , but unfortunately poor acting leading lady cannot convince us she fatally attracted world forbidden her . one scene two ladies dancing together clearly inspired `basic instinct , ' but there no sharon stone her fearless audacious performance , which not afraid campy . johnathon schaech director . . cardone worked together `the forsaken ' `mummy ' armadillo . ' probably `8mm 2 ' worse than these , much worse than nicholas cage original . only thing i thought good it beautiful buildings budapest . but many scenes shot night , even this fun denied us .	-1

this truly one most spectacular films ever made , not suffering made during silent era . however , correctly stated review film , dvd version runs 139mins oppossed vhs 155mins . this not due dvd faster frame rate , but rather because dvd version huge portion film cut no obvious reason . one point , hero ( fairbanks ) fulfilled prophecy princess first touch rose-tree , next minute he seen explaining her ( intimate scene ) he not what he seems . seen vhs number times , i confirm dvd version brutally cut . not buy dvd version , it let-down those scenes missing ; thus reason my one star , which would otherwise 4 1/5 ( 5 stars rimsky korsakov soundtrack ) . you warned	-1
" five hundred dollars !

ok , so i bought this dvd because one my all time favorite actors it ( i'm huge jimmy stewart fan too ! ) . while this movie good back drop cary grant , plot bit bland ... spoiled rich man must make his own living year win bet . some meetings his quot ; moniedquot ; crowd , while he working stiff , entertaing , but not really memorable . maybe i'm used his later movies where he really shined , but this movie just didn't grab me . or maybe it quality dvd . i might gotten more out it if i turned sound off , sound track bad . there few skips usual quot ; old filmquot ; wrinkles visual , but they wouldn't so hard deal if i didn't keep adjusting sound .... even then , some dialogue still sounded like gibberish . could i've just got really bad bootleg copy . i advise against purchasing dvd whose cover case shows cg shoulders up front car stone house .	-1

admirable , incredibly hard hitting view nazi germany wrapped glossy layer songs , spangles slapstick . this breakthrough so many ways - acknowledging holocaust , horror everyday people germany , using satire music bring home chilling message disintegration social values . then we also deal homosexuality , drug use , abortion many other ' tabu ' subjects these things hollywood wasn't too keen explore , so ten stars groundbreaking this film achieved . said , i would encourage anyone get live production . see show it originally written ( film adaptation makes completely different story really ) . it far more compelling , funny then heart breaking experience . not one could captured film . two faces , same coin ..	1
i found this documentary insult my intelligence . here facts : 1 . ) pete best not very good drummer . simple . all you use your ears . all one listen tony sheridan recordings , decca audition tapes , early bbc performances beatles , emi session pete best hear clearly he best competent unexceptional . i mean , that hour music which judge this guy . ringo contrast distinctive touch energy drums immediately brought musical quality beatles much higher realm ( which good drummer usually rock'n'roll , it " beat " oriented music . who without keith moon , or zeppelin without bonham just isn't same . go listen hour earliest recordings beatles ringo it no-contest . sorry pete ! 2 . ) what really offensive this cash-in documentary worst kind-is recording ( pete best band ) beatle sound-alike music soundtrack . when i mean beatle soundalike music , i mean mccartney bass lines ala revolver era , high up neck-jangly guitar or day tripper .... basically beatles music pete best absolutely nothing , subtle implication ( after hearing how much pete best contributed beatles " sound " ) pete might responsible such progression innovation . obviously nothing could further truth . why not record versions early rock'n'roll songs , material pete actually played beatles ? i mean , why am i hearing folk-rock jangle over black white footage depressed liverpool early 60 ? 3 . ) best , not first time , reveals himself one most humourless , dim liverpudlians i've ever seen-and that after seen countless documentaries beatles liverpool scene . less beatle-y personality you'd hard put locate . this just revisionist documentary guy who always sour grapes ( understandably so ) . guy written his autobiography three times . there no mystery why pete best ( correctly ) kicked out beatles . he wasn't one them . , despite revisionist testimony this documentary ( what else these guys going say pete ? they still see him liverpool , work beatlefan convention circuit him ! ) , he just really medicore musical talent . not worse , but nothing original , nothing contributory . he laid down passable beat , he incapbable " interplay " , least based musical evidence available . not so ringo ! go take out your copy beatles version " long tall sally " tell me pete best capable . or beatles version " i'm gonna sit right down cry over you " , either star club or bbc radio recordings . no way . sorry . not million years . very first recording beatles ringo ( " some other guy " cavern club ) , ringo drives band authority , sets down solid groove , contributes interesting , often melodic drumming ideas still influential this day . pete never set down such heavy groove , least not abundant recorded evidence . screw him ! don't waste your money this documentary unless you're completest . trust me this .	-1
first film this trilogy , koyaanisqatsi , classic , features what possibly best score philip glass ever wrote anything . second , powaqatsi , not good but still worth watching . this third installment offers none thought-provoking imagery first two films . it just mishmash computer-treated footage , signifying nothing , all quite forgettable . i wonder what went wrong ? don't waste your time	-1
i would put this classic midnight movie .... movie potential funnier than it but wound up far more disjointed than it should ... it seemed like they trying " hard days night " type film . obstacle they faced johnny rotten wanted nothing this film , only seen concert footage interviews . us tour footage great watch , they really should released dallas san fran footage its entirety here . way , it this film made sid vicious tragic hero turned him into even more cartoon parody himself , but " my way " scene classic . animation funny , silly , memorable . it also fills some blanks , like lydon stabbing record company incident where they out control . would made great adult cartoon they chose take it all way . film worth it pistols footage , but whole ronnie biggs thing pretty much pointless . steve jones malcolm mclaren provided barebones " continudity " throughout film . glen matlock also seen but nothing much more . film essential pistols fans well fans punk rock , although definitely not anyone under 16 . if you're looking documentary pistols , this not film . julien temple " filth fury " pistols documentary bar none puts more depth into vicious well lydon involved , classic albums series " nmtb " , ramones " end century " well . johnny rotten would try his hand acting film called " corrupt " harvey keitel (!) , film went nowhere . don letts ( who there beginning ... dj well big audio dynamite member ) made 2 great films , " punk rock movie " which came out middle punk movement more recent " punk : attitude " which i'd recommend because he talked people who helped shape , influence execute it . here list other recommended films : sid nancy , slc punk , repo man , urgh ! music war , decline western civilization , doa , clash - westway world , fabulous stains , state mind , suburbia , reform school girls , rock roll high school , rude boy , vh1s 25 years punk worth tracking down well .

i remember seeing this movie when i preteen , even back then i witnessed acts violence within my school . mark lester visionary , but brilliant class 1984 foresaw somewhat epidemic events regarding school violence well spawning few imitators . ( i.e. substitute , principal , 187 , class nuke em high , suburbia .. etc . ) best way describe co 1984 would based movie influences ; clockwork orange meets blackboard jungle .. but more grittier . tim van patten deserves praise props his convincing portrayal peter stegman ; psychotic gang leader who his cronies behind drugpushing , gangbanging ( more ways than one , if you get first last 20 minutes film . ) sabotage other capers outside lincon high school . there quite few disturbing moments within film ( spoiler alert)such when black drug dealer cornered stegman gang which stegman utters ; " we're only n*****s here sell drugs .. " this same actor who starred predominetly black cast . ( white shadow)now that acting . mutilation corrigan animals .. peta damned , corrigan ( brilliantly played late great roddy mcdowel planet apes fright night . ) holding class hostage , gang rape scene involving andy norris ' pregnant wife jusfitied rage norris ( mandingo perry king)in which he burns , beats bonesaw sinister gang memebers . very end bit hard swallow ( unless you suspend your disbelief . ) but very satisfactory . m.j. fox role really nothing me i feel king especially van patten parts should've propelled them major stardom . ( guy even wrote personally performed poingant piano scene . ) there no justice i tell ya . my major disapointment dvd , tim rest cast wasn't included blood blackboards retrospective . lester commentary bit dull but it better than bare bones disc . there actually unrated version dts sound over uk . i doubt if anchor bay release it here states , but it better than nuttin'great movie help put punk scene cinematic mapand cool theme song performed shock rocker alice cooper . great 80 classic alongside escape ny , terminator , aliens , road warrior etc . thanks anchor bay !	1
" welcome paradise . name dante ! " so begins sandra bullock jason patric harrowing adventure seaborne legend . beautiful ship , friendly passengers , attentive crew would ordinarily make splendid cruise . unfortunately , among passengers madman who bent ruining everyone vacation . though it would appear this film not universally well-loved , it actually one my favorite action moves . i enjoyed main setting : cruise ship . passengers very funny . among them couple who selling new diet regimen called fat busters , where " fat your friend " ( so body won't try hoard fat , making weight loss difficult ) . their fellow shipmates , surrounded cruise ship banquet-like meal , heartily agree . deaf girl who signs wonderful . villain entertaining . ( admittedly , story behind his motivation destroy ship may rather contrived . ) action moves ocean-liner , speedboat , personal water-craft , propeller aircraft , then finally tower high atop oil tanker . ( if you've ever wondered what it would look like see oil tanker blow up , your curiosity satisfied what happens next . ) all , this movie little like trip amusement park . there lots action this movie , no small amount comedy	1

decades movie going collecting , there only few films keep coming mind unexpected moments . me , this what great art ; , it becomes part one experience not just momentary diversion . sacrifice great film . it touches most fundamental questions human our post-modern world . it it extraordinary grace sublime , haunting , beauty . miss point this film , some reviewers , or call it sophomoric , others , admit one own inability consider life itself may hold greater meaning we more than accidental fluke cold , uncaring universe . this film dares use its considerable art challenge us like zen koan prayer . it meditation what it means fully human mortal moral . it asks us wonder unknown it weeps we prisoners our humanity -- we hold fate our planet our hands . all this sounds kind pretentious , i know , but this magnificent yet simple film works higher level than most movies . it not easily categorized . but big screen , i hypnotized extraordinary cinematography equally transported subtle ideas . it transcendent movie going experience i didn't expect one remained vivid years pass	1

" my whole life ordinary then we met these amazing things started happen . " ~ amanda it love makes amanda better cook makes her cooking taste even better tom ? their senses state heightened awareness chemicals rushing through their bodies or there magic floating ? once she finds recipe caramel eclairs , tom even more attracted her . there very few movies cooking or chefs so this one treat . tear drops food reminded me like water chocolate . emotions amanda feels somehow magically mixed into food she cooking . either dishes make people cry , stun them or make them lose their inhibitions . she seems magical gift culinary creations effect anyone who consumes them . after watching this movie you may want feed your lover oranges , invest some expensive vanilla extract , get lost kiss or cook up some bliss . if you looking best vanilla your cooking , bourbon-madagascar vanilla superior . deliciously cute , silly spells , sweet innocent love few hot steamy kissing scenes kitchen . romantics lovers kitchens cuisine . almost culinary cinderella story . you might enjoy these books : seduction cookbook diane brown ( baked salmon raspberry cabernet sauce , ideas late night seduction snacks information growing erotic herb garden . ) passionfruit cookbook patrick jesse pons-worley ( flavor passion fruit so seductive exotic . ) written spoon ( poetry recipes ) illustrated encyclopedia orchids alec pridgeon edible flower garden rosalind creasy intercourses : aphrodisiac cookbook ( " fig pastries " decadent naughty . ) movies food themes : babette feast like water chocolate scent green papaya my big fat greek wedding big night ~ rebecca review p.s. if you need recipe caramel iced eclairs entice someone , e-mail me my site . i can't believe they didn't publish cookbook go this movie , they still should !	1

if you expecting straight adaptation novel ' naked lunch ' you've come wrong place .. if you looking two styles converging into twisted bizarre sci-fi arthouse extravaganza - step right up .. david cronenberg ( fly , scanners , existenz , etc . ) unique attatchment surreal sci-fi investigations nature reality transformation ( i think i am miserably failing describe his cinema ) - burroughs also style which , shall we say , twists bounds reality -sometimes literally his drug induced descriptions ' naked lunch ' .. but mostly his radical prose style ( something james joyce aldous huxley but extra ingredient bizzare ) .. somehow this meeting two artists works out creates this frightening alternate noir-like alter-universe called interzone .. highlights movie include cronenberg strange puppetry which bring life burroughs creatures his own unconcious mind .. this beautiful movie look - one plays like fever-dream .. my only dissapointment i just read book - still so awe burroughs writing - i trouble excepting interpretation .. but cronenberg artistry actually enhances more than it detracts .	1
set bronx 1963 , wanderers focuses life several young gang members coming age . it surface wanderers may seem like nothing more than sytlish little ditty . but watch closely you'll find this movie existential masterpiece . ken wahl plays richie , handsome charismatic leader wanderers gang . ken juggles his friendships , loyalties , girlfriends , struggles maintain his italian gang position neighborhood . wanderers face threats wongs ( chinese gang ) , baldies ( greaser gang ) , irish gang black gang . but while all these gangs fight eachother , they fail recognize real threats their ethnic enclave end decade existential angst . always edge this movie threat duckie boys gang . movie never identifies ethnic identity duckie boys . instead viewer experiences them silent secret hoard white men emerging fog calm , placid psychotic smiles their faces . duckie boys seem number hundreds-a creepy mass nameless individuals . pivitol scene , wanderers blacks gathered football field throwdown-they see enemy eachother . but edge field ducky boys quietly gather , waiting strike . black , italian chinese band together fight this hoard angry psychotic white men which seem represent urban america-the america threatens swallow them all , force them assimilate leave behind their ethnic identities . threat end era cleverly disguised nina ( karen allen ) , hip beautiful hippie chick . richie enthralled her , but bound his italian girlfriend . he feels nina pull climatic scene they end up back richie car then discovered . ultimately richie returns his girlfriend forced marry her . but nina never really leaves his mind . we see richie his bachelor party he glimpses nina street . he follows her club where bob dylan ( real bob dylan according movie credits ) playing " times they changing " . richie doesn't go talk her , returns bachelor party swallowed up italians . indications he going " made man " , married daughter mafioso but their way life ending . 1970 approaching . nina no doubt go hip east villager richie settle into role he forced play life circumstances , never entering modern society . we left feeling like richie generation last it kind . this movie achieves violence without violent . viewers taste threat never quite know where it coming . characters acting this movie superb . plot subtle unique . it isn't your modern gang movie where drugs guns violence fireworks otherwise extremely dull movie	1

i've always liked this film even though it often dismissed critics because marketing " sensurround " sound film contained made you really feel quakes . most critics thought this hollow film focused gimmick . i disagree strongly . sound other special effects actually very groundbreaking , no pun intended , enhanced one experience film greatly . it huge hit when it came out . fact , even dvd you enjoy this special sound device simply upping bass and/or sub woofer your stereo . i 50 inch plasma television 5.1 dolby sound home theatre system i able recapture much theatre experience i when i first saw film 1974 . it freaked out my kids whom i didn't warn advance what i doing . they loved it . addition , other special effects top-notch still hold up even today . acting well-done all-star cast familar faces although script faulty times , it works well enough . one aspect i really appreciate this film it wasn't afraid kill off major characters we've grown like very much way " deep impact " . makes this disaster flick rather different than most genre . i highly recommend this film . even though this film great sound special effects , there no special features this dvd big disappointment . spite serious oversight , it worth owning you view this film many times . funny note : this film double-billed " towering inferno " once they called both films " shake bake " -- ya gotta appreciate humor	1
this ultimate collection any inxs fan . i love them much now , i eighties . some videos i never seen before , so makes it all better . video kiss dirt stands out me , because it filmed australian outback . what you need listen like thieves also unique videos . before they show each video , one members inxs tells you it , which i thought neat . there also live performances here which great . if you like inxs all , then you should definitely buy this	1

i thoroughly enjoyed " letters iwo jima " , standpoint well-crafted movie excellent acting performances casting , brilliantly subdued cinematography , haunting musical score . all respects , this thoughtful engrossing movie , imbued ever-present melancholy soldiers committed island battle they knew would their last . my only dissatisfaction " letters " , student military history wwii particular , decision downplay legendary ferocity 6 week conflict favor " behind-the-scenes " portrayals japanese soldier inner conflicts longings better times . i appreciate eastwood attempt remind us all human beings share similar longings home , family , peace- especially during surreal happenings war ..... but one should also remember much movie direction came letters written japanese soldiers iwo jima during conflict , unearthed many years later . all soldier letters , beginning time , reveal common threads humanity americans , japanese , germans , whatever .... but they also rarely dwell brutal harrowing realities conflict hand . all histories iwo jima i read , including many eye-witness accounts struggle , replete images ferocity struggle , tenacity japanese defenders , well unbelievable acts individual heroism both sides . 20,000 japanese sent iwo defend it last- somewhere neighborhood 1,000 or less survived . most rest died fighting . my only complaint " letters " it gave little sense struggle itself . it portrays defense mount suribachi almost walk park marines- though eye witness accounts rather different- top mountain fairly secure time marines reached summit famous flag raising(s ) , but several days before ones round-the-clock desperate fighting base mountain . many marine accounts recall those several days worst fighting they experienced whole pacific theatre . movie gives almost no sense . likewise , after suribachi fell , struggle went almost 6 more weeks , filled desperate cave-by-cave fighting , japanese resisting end . yes , there many ritual suicides documented marines(especially caves suribachi ) , but rest island two-way death struggle ultimately took 7,000 american lives . " letters " dwells bit too much " quiet moments " underground- my impression reading histories those moments precious few . movie honor humanity individual japanese soldier , but i think it also sells japanese soldier tenacity bravery quite short . letters recovered tell story , but only small part . letters never written tell story too . most 20,000 japanese soldiers iwo too busy write	1

6th day sheds light ( it should ) reality subsequently threat cloning . helicopter pilot not-so-distant future finds himself run powerful clone-producing corporation . arnold schwarzenegger rest cast truly outdone themselves their performances , which outstanding say least ! all actors , without exceptions , give it their 100% it really shows ( chemistry amazing) ! very well written very well presented , movie without doubt guaranteed provide more than just few thrills . setting , plot , dialogues , music all wonderful ! similarly movies like outbreak , day after tomorrow , island , lord war , blood diamond name few , 6th day draws attention some pretty important issues facing humanity . short , 6th day movie definitely worth watching one seriously consider adding your movie collection !	1
i very impressed objective treatment illegal immigrant situation arizona border . southern arizona resident , i've seen both sides issue first hand . if you concerned border , you likely find this movie informative . it portrays both sides , pro con stricter enforcement vs . amnesty . most importantly , it portrays human element . everyone border affected debate . debate if you , humans ( families , children , business owners ) environment ( range land , recreation areas ) affected . long time residents border towns fearful because limited support they security damage property litter constant people trafficing causes . many individuals groups concerned health safety those crossing into us . either way , safety , health problems , course , money all issues presented forefront this film . cries border portrays these concerns sympathy ( objectively ) both sides . i recommend this movie anyone who wishes present informed debate critical issues border security . it informs realistically gives insight into how critical this issue all us .	1

titanic compelling film real life story h.m.s. titanic . story detailed moving provides titanic lovers perspective agony suffering passengers this great ship endured during its last moments . those interested maritime safety or just interested knowing story behind titanic tragedy , this highly recommended movie . those not familiar history this great liner , brief narration may help . titanic launched belfast may 1911 . magazine time described it " practically unsinkable " . liner impressive its size features . she 269 metres long , 28 metres wide tall eleven storey building . luxury ship unique unparalleled time . among luxury features swimming pool first class passengers , first built liner . titanic set sail southampton 10 april 1912 . 14 april 1912 , look out man sounded alarm bells announced iceberg just ahead them . unfortunately , it too late ship collided iceberg within some few seconds , starboard side liner torn open seawater poured . sadly , there not enough lifeboats board only small fraction passengers ( largely those travelling first class ) rescued almost all those third class not rescued . ship band continued play during commotion followed stern ship rose high ship began sink . over 1500 people perished this accident . among critical lessons we learn this tragedy need effective safety management system . thankfully , many lessons learnt tragedy helped regulatory authorities , manufacturers ship owners come up design operational features made liners much safer .	1

i just couldn't believe how advanced these time they filmed . sure , you see strings holding up captain marvel while he flys , you even tell it dummy flying across screen . but it extremely well . story good starts expidition valley tombs where group people ( archeologists ? ) find hidden chamber tomb . hidden chamber one most powerful tools known man . golden scorpion , some lenses held it , it turn any regular object gold , or destroy any living thing existence . when they realize potential evil this item could , men divvy out lenses scorpion each other decide each hide his piece somewhere . same time , billy met old man who tells him he imbued power become captain marvel . however he told not abuse his powers , only use them stop scorpion . serial continues omnious scorpion brought life trying get all hidden pieces golden scorpion so he rule world ! thing i like this , previously stated , it 1941 , but doesn't adhere normal " super hero rules " . people die hands captain marvel ... but they deserved it ! saying , there course no really violent imagery . simply captain marvel doing stuff like throwing guys off top building or whatever . but you get idea . still good enough kids , i hardly wait show this my son when i get home	1
i rented this thinking it " place sun " ( also shelley winters)and so it took me bit not keep trying work story line into this one ( when he going push shelley off boat , i kept wondering ? ) :) anyway , once i adjusted fact this movie abused , lonely blind girl befriended black man , i found myself entranced lovely tale friendship forms under mutual adversity . gordon ( sidney poitier)helps blind selina move towards life independence freedom her mean , domineering mother ( winters ); selina offers gordon love friendship biased , racist world . takes no cheap shots offers no simplistic answers even better becaus . touching disturbing both . well worth locating watching	1
*** this comment may contain spoilers *** " manhunter " ( 1986 ) directed michael mann - masterpiece , pure simple . it took me five times but i finally realized it . i see it best adaptation favorite book written subject serial killers investigation their crimes . i also discovered william blake his fascinating art , including painting which gave book its title , " red dragon " , thanks mr. harris . michael mann certainly read book " red dragon " before he started work movie he able get inside it well book main character , graham able get inside murderer mind . scene where graham ( william peterson ) finds out who killer makes me shiver every time i watch movie . i not recall " moment truth " powerful convincing this one . it more powerful similar scene " sound lambs " where clarise starling figures out who where " buffalo bill " . michael mann took his time understanding how important scene it received royal treatment movie . i used disappointed mann cut book very impressive ending but after many viewings i think i understand why he it . me , whole movie build up " moment truth " scene after graham figured who murderer making us participants process , it not really matter ( least me ) how they going catch francis " red dragon " dolarhyde .	1
true most shows , first season ds9 ( seen hindsight ) actors groping bit their ultimate personality style seen later seasons . some interactions ( odo quark example ) seem bit over top compared nuances seen later seasons . still , there fair amount backstory covered this season makes later seasons more enjoyable watch . my opinion , ds9 first star trek franchise work more story arc than individual episodes could watched any order . quality dvd transfer not good later seasons ; likely they didn't preserve source material like today shows . softness/dirtiness picture what vhs tape would look like . not terrible , but not measuring up today dvd standards either	1

you say headache ? video editing switches multiple camera angles rate 1 camera every 2 seconds . you never get see anyone band " jam " out . i think editor wanted avoid boring just showing stage one camera , but result opposite extreme . it pretty much ruined perfect dvd me . band stellar audio incredible . i think it better turn tube off just crank speakers . or just buy cd . compare this death - live la you see what i mean	-1

( you could least get rid tape ! ) i also don't like menu set-up dvds . it would great if all 10 episodes would play through instead 5 episodes each selection . these my only gripes though . fisher price little people stories great otherwise	1
i total yoga noob before trying this video . i work out gym , treadmill weight machines , well working out firm videos , so i'm average shape . i think even if you're not , this great place begin . you work your own pace , alan finger describes motions breathing quite explicitly , moves demonstrated different levels different people . if you're beginner like i am , it perfect	1
poetic , beautiful hypnotic . series short vignettes lushly evoke some kurosawa dreams/visions . must anyone interested history classic films , and/or visual art . i use portions art appreciation class , context artists creating work out inner experiences or subconscious . it well received	1
while this movie wasn't deep-arguably is-it creative , unique , quite realistic . if you pay close attention dialogue it predictable especially if you like figure things out before they happen . willard carroll left just enough room make you wonder then certain revelations-unless you're out it-are expected not surprising . characters believable acting entire cast nothing short sensational . if you get confused easily , stick it out , comes together very nicely end . side note-two things : 1 . how excellent gillian anderson ability show range . don't get me wrong , love dana scully , i , however , she unsung hero when it comes this art . ( see her masterpiece theater bleak house . ) 2 . it my opinion most comedians stick comedy there but few when they transition or give drama try excellent job . said hats off jon stewart . his performance more than respectable .	1
not only this great show my daughter , but i loved it too . i remember it when i child .	1
ok , so this isn't best sci-fi movie ever but it really fun , if you get into it . this adventure looks like cross " road warrior " " alien " it tells story bounty hunter wolfe(peter strauss , tring hard but just not han solo ) landing planet ravaged plage rescue three ladies who crashed there held hostage strangest villian ever overdog(michael ironside(looking like borg grade ham) ! young molly ringwald hand ernie hudson help strauss get girls back . slow places some really strange encounters planets other citizens make it mixed bag , but i said if you get into spirit fun you may find you like this one also ! give it try !	1
i agree reviewer who mentioned unfinished subplots unexplained sequences . i gave this movie chance because i am huge john candy fan never heard it , but , i know often , sleeper movies buried gems just waiting found ( la benny joon)but this wasnt one them im afraid . i found this movie mildly amusing , john candy very well but overall , movie doesnt hold up his other movies . ending dissapointing there too many , above mentioned , unfinished subplots . there supposed some sort development john larroquette sequence ? really pointless addition other than give family somewhere go while candy learned his sailing yeah , what wrong popcorn ? i loved you john candy i miss you dearly , you'll always place my heart , however , this movie probably never watched again . i see you again , planes , trains automobiles .	-1
i first heard lee ritenour when i started listening fourplay . before then , i didn't really listen much jazz . friend got me hooked pat metheny , it all started there . this dvd important contribution any jazz fan collection . it spans ritenour career 70s now , it it featuring not only music but also people he played . atmosphere not what i thought it would : rather than " this lee ritenour , these people who i decided allow play me this project , " it " these people good their own right : i brought them here celebrate history , make little well . " dvd also not extended guitar solo . it very much lee ritenour friends . interaction artists this setting amazing watch . fact they all improvise so well , stay close theme piece , bring everything back together when it time says lot quality musicians ritenour assembled this project . dave grusin , ernie watts , patrice rushen , anthony jackson more - these not just studio musicians hired make one man look good . whole this case indeed greater than sum it parts . some standout moments dvd : * set featuring brazilian music ivan lins , including " harlequin . " * ritenour hand-punishing " captain fingers . " * my personal favorite : rendition miles davis ' " blue green . " when i 10 , i used listen am station washington dc played jazz every friday saturday night midnight six morning . this song reminded me lot songs i used listen transistor radio under my pillow . interviews included add lot historical value dvd set . this can't stressed enough - this dvd some long-term value people who serious fans jazz , because way it covers 30-year span time . it also great collection someone whose jazz collection looking bit thin , because right here you see hear some great talent . it clear after 30 years playing jazz , lee ritenour hasn't lost step . this collection proves it , highly recommended	1
good disney movie seen whole family . good stor	1
" little britain " ( season one ) , me , extremely funny show . until i purchased this dvd , i not familiar this series , i'm certainly , now , very ardent fan . series sketches very well written acted matt lucas david walliams . my god , they so very funny playing all major roles . typical british , aforesaid includes female roles too . " drag " roles seem bring out best matt lucas david walliams . i love almost impossible understand , fast talking , chain smoking , incorrigible --" yeah but no but yeah , shut-up " -- vicky pollard who finds herself , most time , wrong side law . i also really like pudgy , extremely rude ( other fatties ) very condescending marjorie dawes -- leader " fat fighters " . ( her best advise " fat challenged " they eat all dust they want ! ) most all , i adore emily howard unsuccessful transvestite . he tries convince everyone comes within his sights he " real " lady . yes , all named characters played wonderfully matt lucas david walliams . humorous introductions each sketch given resounding voice tom baker which very funny indeedabove , i've named just few my favorites . there many more . if you prude , don't bother this show ; it bound offend you . however , if you like really funny british humor boarders obscene some might consider bad taste ( i don't ) , buy this show ; me it really hysterical .	1
last year , longrunning detective series " monk " ( obsessie-compulsive detective ) got paired new show , lighthearted comedy-mystery series kooky faux-psychic who solves crimes . together , these shows even more delightful , charmingly eccentric characters some very nice writing . fifth season " monk " opens movie made monk ( tony shalhoub ) life amazing abilities , well-known actor david ruskin ( stanley tucci ) monk . but ruskin turns out world best method actor , he observes monk doing his detective work -- starts acquire monk ocd personality . but monk problems don't cease when he paralyzed garbage strike , strike leader murdered . other cases include mysterious electrocution gym shower , blinded murderer , stint private eye , college reunion , disastrous rock concert , leper , marijuana , radio host whose wife died while he air , he competes against technology find serial killer . end monk hour comes time shawn spencer ( james roday ) his long-suffering pal gus ( dul� hill ) . shawn strict , humorless dad coached him since early childhood perfect future cop -- hyperobservant , highly intelligent , perfect detective . but when he reports his observations police , they arrest him -- his only way out pretend psychic . fact , his gimmick works brilliantly -- soon he sets up shop psychic , after plucking gus dull job . among their colourful cases : death spelling bee , haunting sorority house , wedding tainted theft murder , ghostly stalking , cat used witness , civil war reenactments , comic book convention , alien abductions , underground poker , organizing surprise birthday party lassiter . " monk " " psych " lot common . they're both hyperobservant eccentrics , they both solid mysteries some hilarious writing , although monk tends rather sadder tone , compared frothy twentysomething hijinks gus shawn . seen together , these shows seem like two kind . but whatever differences , they both colourful mysteries ( sometimes unexpected twists ) , some deliciously strange dialogue , whether it monk depressed ( " i wish i drank . it wonderful ? " ) or shawn flailing pretending psychic ( " spare me ! spare me ! auuuwwwww ! " ) . comedy , we get see what shaped characters into who they . granted , neither series quite perfect -- monk ocd becomes rather cartoonish few episodes , such his nutty reaction his shrink retiring . mysteries shawn gus solve take little while suitably mysterious -- middle season , they both fun suspenseful , such whole speed-dating episode . leads both shows absolutely delightful -- tony shalhoub hysterical ( such when he tries butler ) , but also heartbreaking , such when monk watches his old wedding video . roday , other hand , just hilarious comic actor . his shawn devoid responsibility or dignity , he rides through luck -- but he good heart , genuinely good detective . both shows great supporting casts , especially hill long-suffering gus , traylor howard monk nurse-sidekick . all cops -- including gray-stanford ormondson -- get plenty character development . they some celebrity appearances : " psych " george takei , while monk some small , hilarious roles alice cooper tucci . sean astin gives glorious performance murderous , spoiled rich brat . fifth season " monk " helped first season " psych " get off ground . these smartly-written , humorous mystery series well-paired , both definitely worth getting	1

director james gray elicited some marvelous performances really eclectic cast : oscar winners ellen burstyn faye dunaway play domestic characters professional verve they always bring ; oscar nominees charlize theron , james caan joaquin phoenix superb their roles wahlberg cousin , best friend uncle-in-law ; then we mark wahlberg , steve lawrence tony musante rounding out cast . this wahlberg shining moment ; he none macho bravado usually associated him , his performance complex , multi-faceted courageous . caan also brilliant , someday he'll get oscar he deserves . phoenix also shows great emotional depth his role borderline sociopath . theron proves she not just pretty face , but capable engaging actress . film slow pace line psychological nuances film . i'd never heard it until i saw trailer video . outstanding film . highly recommended	1

it possible make version lewis carroll classic alice wonderland turn it into disaster so unbelievable sanitized walt disney version just seems totally magical wonderful contrast ? yes , but it takes bbc it . somehow , someway , 1966 bbc created , believe it or not , christmas special alice world so devoid joy wonder it amazing piece work watch . alice , 13-year old brunette anne-marie mallik , completely emotionless throughout seventy-two minute production almost never making eye contact other characters acting almost catatonic when she isn't acting irratible bored . wonder even stripped away other cast characters . except cheshire cat played real cat voiced alice herself ( which gives you weird impression she only talking herself some delusion ) , all other characters regular actors victorian dress , not anthropomorphic animals form tropes all alice adventures . yes , there masterful performances peter cook ( mad hatter ) , sir john gielgud ( mock turtle ) , peter sellers ( king hearts ) delight watch , especially sir michael redgrave delightful interpretation caterpillar , but too-few examples great acting , eerie victorian sets , ravi shankar interesting soundtrack don't cover up fact there total lack understanding lewis carroll tribute alice liddell . result then complete reinterprtation carroll work into black white victorian gothic where listlessness , boredom , ennui reign . if your cup tea , then all means enjoy production	-1

this movie started off promising atmosphere which hinted fun thrills come , but let horribly down laughable special effects , paper-thin clich�'d characters some cringingly awful acting . students ( blonde bimbo , geeky nerd sincere young thing crush stereotypical workaholic prof ) heading off their jeep into wilderness certainly potential , but any attempts build creepy atmosphere isolation diluted spoiled intrusion weak pointless sub-plot army special forces unit battling against insurgents . this military operation ( think arnie team predator meets marines aliens ) gives coolio stage strut his stuff . but , i'm sorry say , convincing he ain't . obliged join forces students , remainder film basically series action set-pieces which humans battle it out pterodactyls . ensuing gore laid very ott style reminiscent evil dead series ( but nowhere near stylish ) creates few ( unintended ? ) laughs . 18 rating certainly undeserved too - there far more effective scary 15 out there . even straight dvd `b ' movies go , this pretty poor fare . final scene hints sequel - they really shouldn't bother	-1

i loved this movie moment i saw it sale my video store discard rack ten years ago . i recently received dvd gift sound quality big improvement over my old vhs copy . i recommend it performances , story photography . jodie foster monologue toward end film particularly memorable . each girl story line realistic film itself good job capturing teen life late 70s before yuppie values took hold . this not john hughes film refreshing change anyone who subjected director teen films 80s	1
i love david lynch , guy so brilliant unique . every single one his movies masterpiece , even though most people don't understand what going . this dvd set we're treated several his short films ; some made while he college , one while he making ' eraserhead ' , one after ' blue velvet ' , one late nineties . make it even better , there introduction each film lynch himself . he talks them , but he doesn't explain them , which cool ... but it would also cool hear explanation him . anyway first film called " six men getting six ( six times ) " which painting he morphed into 3 minute short movie . combined sound siren , it fascinating unique . second short film " alphabet , " which star lynch then wife peggy very creepy 4-minute creation . introduction , lynch actually explains how he got idea . next short film " grandmother , " which he made grant he given american film institute . thing virtually no dialogue makes no sense , but images flash across screen ( young boy plants seed his bed grows grandmother ) very creepy . i think it little too long though . " amputee " features two versions , shot two different kinds black white stock ... well , odd . it like we're suddenly eavesdropping girl who legs amputated . she writing letter aboutt something we no knowledge , while doctor messes her legs which begin shooting some kind liquid . creepy , but not disturbing . next up " cowboy frenchmen " which complete change pace ... it comedy stars harry dean stanton (' wild heart ' ) , jack nance (' eraserhead ' ) , dude you see bunch movies like ' erin brockovich ' ' twin peaks . ' film says lot culture , while stupid but very funny . then we finale , 55-second short called " lumiere . " despite short , it very clever one lynch creepiest creations . this not dvd casual lynch fans . if there david lynch movie you hated , then you not like this movie . people who think eraserhead his best movie definitely love this . people who like mulholland dr. blue velvet no doubt find this interesting . while it not most entertaining dvd market , i enjoyed it immensely . grade : a-	1

i saw this during its theatrical release loved it . when i purchased boxed set peckinpah westerns , it first i played . how it held up ? i would given it five stars back then ; today just four ( which ain't shabby ) . difference represents effect 30+ years my sensibilities more than theatrical viewing versus dvd . cast features excellent performances : jason robards perfect cable ; david warner effective preacher ; peckinpah stalwarts strother martin , . . jones , slim pickins always interesting . clunker , me , stella stevens . whore-with-a-heart-of-gold character type which i problem . it not problem morality ; it problem reality . problem here compounded choice miss stevens . it not her acting - her performance quite good - it her appearance . while scruffy appearances other characters place them plausibly turn-of-the-century arizona , miss stevens appearance screams 1960s southern california . i would found less attractive actress harder edge more effective role . problem here may mine alone ( miss stevens performance widely praised ); i viewed movie more fantasy , miss stevens would not posed problem she . overall , it quibble what otherwise immensely enjoyable film	1

" roots , rock , reggae " documentary showing snapshot reggae music jamaica 1976 . reggae fan , this film offers unadulterated , unique glimpse into island environments fostered one greatest musical genres 20th century . filmmakers show how where music recorded , where it sold , concert footage . more importantly than actual music , this film focuses social cultural roots jamaica national music . they show how it grew crushing poverty areas like trenchtown , its link rastafarianism , how it inexorably linked jamaican politics . features footage lee perry work his black ark studio ( before he burned it down ); interviews jimmy cliff joe higgs ; original concert footage u-roy , gladiators , mighty diamonds , abyssinians , ( very early ) inner circle . film segment bob marley , but not concentrate extensively godfather reggae . course , quality film crude even 1970s standards , but so some greastest reggae ever made - not make it not good ! those interested reggae roots should also check out books " reggae bloodlines , " " reggae explosion : story jamaican music , " " people funny boy " lee perry biography .	1

i not really know what expect when i went see this film . i aware it one biggest grossing french films box office france all time , mysterious beast terrorised french countryside 1760s . i went see it suburban cinema younger members audience sneering french accents subtitles . not last very long , however , because film soon utterly engrossed them , indeed , it myself . samuel le bihan plays adventurer/naturalist who attached royal court versailles . he sent rural region france try trap elusive beast which now responsible increasing number killings . accompanying him his quest ' half brother'- mani ( played veteran martial arts films - mark dacascos . two made welcome chateau local aristocrat there they begin their ques t.t he film not really fall into any genre but draws number . throw martial arts fights , superstitious peasants , beast looks like relative monster ' relic ' , packs wolves , deformed madman , plots overthrow monarchy , you idea what expect .... director christopher gans ( silent hill)has made beautifully photographed multi layered film here . film progresses , gradually reality what going becomes apparent . cinematography superb - particular forest snow sequences which almost enchanted/magical feel them . cast all superb play out their roles relish . film brutal places not hold back gore . indeed , some younger film goers who earlier sneering , becoming quite upset agitated hunting sequences which graphically depict culling local wolves . this unique film well worth look . don't expect it fall into any category though but instead prepare something very different	1

i splurged treated myself this set my last birthday ( devil night . ) i wanted all three films available should i feel need watch them again . concept supernatural justice always appealed me- it seems only kind really exists .... i wasn't dissappointed this set . it contains all three " collectors series " versions , which means they packed full special features . profile james o ' barr creator original comic series especially good . plus , there special little booklet gives outline making films . i really can't quite get resentment some people over last two films . i mean , original comics reoccuring theme different crows different injustices righted . sure , original film far best , almost supernaturally superior , but other two also manged stay true vision .	1

i love this dvd . it very easy use you pre-program what workout you want , depending your time constraints , your own physical needs level . 1 . 20 minute cardio workout . i'm doing low intensity ( high intensity also available ) cardio i find it very enjoyable . i love all workouts this segment - those which include grapevine , shuffle , lunges , rainbow , almost all movements . even my 3-year old daughter loves them , so she imitates me while watching me workout . i went through high intensity me , low intensity lot more fun . 2 . 10 minute upper body . i'm also doing low intensity ( but dvd medium high too ) but instead chair , i use stability ball when i'm doing weights . i find it more flexible it ball than chair . 3 . 10 minute lower body . i don't consider my lower body main problem spot , so now , i skip this section due time constraints . that why this dvd so good , you choose what you want , depending your needs ! this also available low , medium high intensity . i went through section , though , find variety lower body exercises which i haven't seen some yet . i try this when i luxury time . ;-) 4 . 10 minute abs . this my problem spot so i always make it point this all time . this tough you would really feel it working all sections your abs . there lot variation basic crunches which i find very useful . i hope it works visibly , though ! i lot flab hiding my 6-pack . lol ! 5 . last segment stretching which basically usual stretching we see , but course , very important cool down . all all , i give this dvd 5+ stars easy use workouts doable but effective . i guess i'm fast becomming denise fan . i enjoy her workouts me her talkies not distracting . but if you get annoyed her voice , there also function play music only . buy this , it worth it	1
i am not movie buff but i enjoyed movie it superbly entertaining . i even watched scenes cut movie appreciated director took time so . he explored many avenues hit nail head his chosen direction we all better entertained it . i love history well got kick out historic references . tender friendship stories black faces comforting see	1
always entertaining movie little it everyone ? chick flick ? sure , but enough testerone pumping scenes humor scattered throughout guys like it too . firefighting scenes end you end your seat , general theme movie keeps you interested throughout . good movie pick up movie night house or friends coming over .	1
i first saw film theaters seen it several times since . it still breathtaking rivals newer nature films created big screen . movie contains drama , comic relief , action sadness . all emotions surround situation most planets large predators . film appropriate elementary students ( there one scene where you see main characters cheeks , however)to adults . some might call part story slow , but it reflects life . parts life not high action scenes . main character performs neat experiment testing observed diet wolves illustrating parts scientific method . one could good classroom discussion over this portion movie alone . music wonderful put memorable sound arctic my mind . price movie ecological must .	1
this show original idea , take old movies ham up language make them funny wacky . this whole show played max hokey . it aired 1960s ( those you under 45 may not want apply ) seeing it now dvd includes bit nostalgia watch these shows again . these shows played laughs , hans conreid , host , doing most this line play . explain theme this show , they took old movies lot effort created wacky dialogue " update " silents make plot (?) out them completely different thesis than silent movie once showed . i no idea how they found so many old movies " improve " , but it amusing then ( 60 , when this show aired ) watch this it now too . if you like rocky bullwinkle , you'll like this show essentially same group , uh , artisans (?) . it not seinfeld-style humor , nor stand-up comic humor , instead this sort very hokey , consciously self-pretentious , over-done sort humor makes you laugh much their silliness their puns their frankly funny adaptations old movies into absurdities dubbed dialogue . it interesting combination old silent movies added-on dialogue . not everyone , great some us .	1
michael moriarity my hero ! he just one coolest actors my opinion . he such great b-movies this , , it alive 3 : island alive . how awesome he ?? anyways , i think this movie hilarious ! i think lot people take this movie too seriously , thinking it going your typical movie . but you shouldn't because not only this b-movie , but it supposed funny . my favorite part when " stuff " started bubbeling out ground old hick guy just starts eating it . who would ?? i just started laughing butt off when happened . so if you watch this movie , just sit back enjoy it what it worth , don't too critical it . what i learned stuff : dairy products evil ! especially if they come earth ! if you like stuff , i recommend : watching other b-movies , such island alive 3 , zombi 3 4 , etc	1
i've fan series since start . humor disgusting , crude obscene yet same time insightful , smart witty almost impossible find . south park makes it happen . it just keeps getting better better not afraid push limits . trey parker matt stone two geniuses who aren't afraid speak their minds it most creative funny way possible . i talk this show my daily life anyone who doesn't understand this humor needs wake up .	1

memento ultimate whodunit mixed time-space conundrums . it swallows up competition this department , but maybe because it near overload . forward , back ,. two steps back one step forward . after while it feels like i'm watching jeopardy ! i'm always getting answers , finding out how they turned out way end up half fun . movie centers man named leonard ( guy pearce ) who trying put together clues figure out what happening him . his last real memory his wife dying hands unknown assailant . movie starts out showing us leonard motel room going over various notes messages he written himself pieces paper , his hands , various polaroid pictures he taken . leonard seems his shor t-t erm memory " reset " after every 17 minutes or so . result this memory loss comes accident took place when he tried stop his wife assailant . memento one you really pay attention , i'm not kidding . however , you'll catch pattern after while , which makes it even more fun . show jump back forth show leonard various stages , then show us how he actually got there , why he wrote down what he , if he fact , coming closer getting answer . paranoia seems set into theme well we , viewers , never sure who trust , let alone wonder if what leonard writing down lead his success or ultimate demise .

this collection definitely worth any remington steele fan , but last two seasons series together one set , it very uneven package . if i could break it down , i would give 5 stars season 4 , 2 stars season 5 , 3 stars extras . season 4 not best series . show already passed its peak , but it still quite good . season some classic episodes , including " beg , borrow or steele , " which laura mr. steele presumed dead mildred arrested their murder , " dancer , prancer , donner steele , " christmas episode which gang taken hostage bunch santas , " sensitive steele , " most in-depth exploration relationship we ever get show . other episodes like " coffee , tea , or steele , " " steele blushing , " " steele your service , " " forged steele , " " steele running " very strong well . even weaker episodes like " suburban steele " " steele inc . " their moments . although some other reviewers pointed out , series started look more dated less " classic " fourth year , overall , it still its trademark charm , wit , sophistication . character development season 4 , mildred discovers secret mr. steele invented miss holt , so dynamic among three changes bit . relationship laura mr. steele also develops little over course season , but usual this show , we given just enough make us want more , never enough satisfy . often referred show " foreplay , " rs delivers not delivering . season 4 provides plenty little romantic moments keep us intrigued couple -- we even see them admitting other people they're " committed " each other -- but they still never consummate relationship . yes , some complained , if you think it , it bizarre two healthy adults could such hot heavy romance four years still remain chaste , but you're not really supposed think it too much . that why , few exceptions , only minute or two per episode devoted relationship . tease , perhaps , start wear little thin season 4 . if show continued full year , some point they would fish or cut bait relationship . but me , amazing chemistry pierce brosnan stephanie zimbalist keeps me coming back more throughout fourth season , even when i realize i'm played little writers who wanted their cake eat it too . time we reach fifth season , however , everything changed . others mentioned , show cancelled after fourth season , most things come back dead , it never same again . mercifully short fifth season very " we don't want here " feel it . exotic locations serve poor substitutes good story-telling character development . plots become thin tedious . humor goes clever overly silly farcical . characters inconsistent previous seasons . inclusion jack scalia ( tony ) cast totally throws off dynamic worked so well what classy , silver-screen-inspired romantic duet . basically , show lost its heart . fans not get emotionally satisfying ending , it still makes me little bitter after all these years . extras same other seasons , just little less . i know you can't expect much extras such old show , well , you don't get much . there few featurettes okay . farewell steele one make me very nostalgic sad see series come end ( again ) . i give extras three stars instead two , because these featurettes , especially because they able get interviews all three stars . that probably big coup such old show . what i didn't care much extras episode commentaries . i already mentioned this my review season 3 , but i really wish whoever charge putting together extras dvds like this would send commentors copy ahead time so they could take 45 minutes watch show before doing commentary it . it not interesting listen people guessing plot points they don't remember episode you just watched . you expect hear something interesting , it little insulting viewer commentors ramble , laugh in-jokes , constantly interrupt each other , etc . -- basically terrible job . what even more annoying one commentary guy who actually joked what bad job they doing . yes , it hilarious waste time people who support show who spent good money these dvds . anyway , i'm not saying there not some good bits information commentaries , but they're few far . overall , though , disappointing final season poor commentary skills people involved series take away little these dvds or series whole . it great whole set , wealth wonderful episodes -- all 94 -- right there nice , convenient package , return whenever i want . but i'm also little wistful this last set . seeing my favorite childhood show dvd first time close i ever get recapturing magic watching it when it originally aired . now i've savored every episode -- good , bad , big-haired--it sad say goodbye again	1

i origionaly didn't want watch this film i mean come film starring sandra bullock but it my girlfriend who suggested i watch this film said i might like it now i admit it pretty good . sandra bullock plays woman named birdee pruitt who believes happy perfect life until she appears national television hears her best friend confessing affair her husband . she then leaves her married home travels her birth place texas where she begins rebuild her life relationships especialy her mother young daughter who hates birdee . i surprised film didn't any cliche hollywood moments it dealt human emotions realistic , birdee overcome humiliation public betrayal she obviously lot problems but soon harry connick jr. ' character comes hopefully win birdee heart since they knew each other highschool . film very uplifting way it serious romantic drama bit humor so i enjoyed this film alot i didn't hesitate fact i like sandy these roles everybody else gave great performance i hope she stars more films like this instead those awful comedies , i highly recomend this film	1

japanese-american raised 1960 , i always mixed feelings 1961 film version rodgers hammerstein chinese-american musical comedy . although it refreshing see so many asian faces mainstream studio movie ( granted several japanese-american actors chinese roles ) , portrayals always struck me trite catering pre-existing stereotypes . now it finally come out dvd forty-five years after its initial release , i appreciate it much more without raising my eyebrows much , perhaps because it now seems so much nostalgic product eisenhower-era sensibilities . reason dvd contains pristine print balances saturated use color throughout . moreover , there music , which while not grade-a material legendary team , enough their recognizably melodious style make whole affair quite entertaining now . set san francisco chinatown late 1950 , souffl�-light story , written joseph fields , family-oriented , musical-chairs romantic comedy focused east-west cultural differences primarily well-to-do wang household headed ultra-traditional master wang . it starts pretty mei li , who stowed away chinese steamer her professor father become mail-order bride nightclub owner sammy fong . en route , they end up staying wang home where she develops crush eldest son wang ta . but he infatuated saucy showgirl linda low , who intent making sammy jealous enough him propose after five years non-commitment . wang ta linda turn out mismatch , which would good news if only mei li marriage contract not so binding . if situation not complicated enough , dressmaker doormat helen chao lifelong crush wang ta well . all-asian cast assembled , rarity itself back then , it helps most perform within constraints movie quite well . looking like porcelain doll brought life , miyoshi umeki lends her uniquely plaintive quality role mei li , she sings quiet clarity her trademark song , " hundred million miracles " . wang ta , james shigeta , also pleasant singer , sincere matinee idol looks match , although his na�ve character seems excessively dim when it comes women . both , however , overshadowed shenanigans provided nancy kwan , her pin-up cutie peak , linda , jack soo full dean martin mode cynical sammy . even though their stormy relationship seems lifted completely nathan adelaide " guys dolls " , they provide lion share entertainment domestic fantasy , " sunday " particular highlight . while dubbed , kwan performs boudoir classic , " i enjoy girl " , sexy flair , she dances graceful exuberance " fan tan fannie " especially " grand avenue " virtual battalion dancers . benson fong , who memorably played charlie chan #3 son his youth , brings necessary bluster master wang , while juanita hall , bloody mary " south pacific " , stays mainly sidelines understanding auntie liang except when she solos " chop suey " . supporting cast , two performers stand out - teenaged patrick adiarte dancing energetically younger son wang tan , lovelorn helen , reiko sato leads stunning ballet show best song , " love , look away " ( her voice dubbed legendary soprano marilyn horne ) . opening credits showcase series striking watercolor paintings artist dong kingman , russell metty richly colorful cinematography finally appreciated dvd . 2006 dvd extras generous starting solid commentary track kwan british film historian nick redman . even though kwan sometimes gets derailed her life story , she redman partner well bringing out intriguing aspects production cast . there five featurettes which feel like components one feature-length documentary since same participants show up all five . first one talks story transition original novel c.y. lee broadway musical directed gene kelly 1961 movie 2002 broadway revival developed david henry hwang . other shorts focus casting , score , sets costumes , more personal look rodgers hammerstein . it interesting how veteran filmmaker henry koster barely mentioned since he directed film , though his pedestrian direction truly least impressive part movie	1
great performance who , although they pinch less-rehearsed here ( this 1999 gig one very first times , if not first time , who stripped away all extra brass , backup singers , second guitar extra percussion ) than they reunion arena dallas , texas , aug . 27 , 2000 , but they still rocked . i could used little more camera angles john entwistle ( rip ) , last half or third show seems concentrate more townshend daltrey . but still great show . band fighting form , even amid couple goofs - daltrey early entrance near end " anyway , anyhow , anywhere , " townshend breaking two or three strings during show , keeping soundman bobby pridden hopping stratocasters hand . who still best band around . this show , seemingly short around 90 minutes , would morph into 2000 tour , which would group best post-keith moon tour . i agree previous reviewer . lack special guests ( i love paul weller/the jam ) makes this dvd favorite . it interesting townshend daltrey seem almost feuding this show . townshend makes fun daltrey messing his inner-ear sound monitors near end show , telling audience , " thanks letting us experiment you . well , some us experimenting . " who still rock , although they're not quite strong when ox thumped bass them ( or when moonie drummer ) , but they're still greatest live band now . beginners should pick up " kids alright " dvd first , then move this video " live isle wight 1970 " ( 2006 version two bonus songs ) dvd . boston 2002 dvd , released late 2004 first tour new bassist pino palladino , good , but maybe not best starting point potential ' oo heads . 2000 royal albert hall dvd ( released fall 2001 ) good too , " concert new york city , " where who four-song set worth price admission alone ! who rocks . can't wait see them dallas seven days	1

don't want create war previous reviewer , but after watching this fun flick last night , i throw my 2 cents . if you looking deep , touching , sensitive moving film then don't bother this one ( cover art clearly shows you what expect ) . also if you're kind person who doesn't appreciate beauty dirty joke , then move something else . now if you looking something different , hysterical , funny , then buy this now ! we ( myself 6 friends ) watched this last night we laughing so hard we crying . fact , we pause it several times we couldn't control our laughter we missing continuing dialogue . i think that what this film all ......... fun entertaining . i don't think writers/producers/directors/actors high hopes oscar . too clarify my rebuttal my title ...... " america prove british approach " ...... these artists took comedy ala benny hill but gay twist it .	1
i know it probably all said , but yes , i extremely disappointed not see original ending included movie . so i watched extras , shivering anticipation this mythical " original ending . " let down again ! we aren't even given final version ! bah ! sorry , but i've always rooted duckie . he least deserved some screen time dancing his true love . but- it still great movie , other extras quite satisfying , such " favorite scenes " which includes duckie infectious dance try little tenderness fight duckie steff ( you love shot duckie peering over edge balcony down steff , staring him down look death ) . i really disappointed not hear james spader extras . he always my favorite jerk . " you got problem , friend ? " those linen suits penny loafers no socks ?! i just can't get enough his smug , self-satisfied rich boy . also , hearing cast talking john hughes ' behind scenes- directing interesting . you see how he got most his actors . more i watch this movie , more i am convinced there never stronger teenage actress than likes molly ringwald . her pout , her passion , her fury- quintessential redhead . " what prom , blane ?! " so , conclusion , dvd worth watching ( or renting ) but i don't feel need replace my vhs copy just yet	1

i think anthony hopkins gives terrific portrayal paul ( not i've ever met paul .... :) he brings lot character i never really considered reading bible . he great job " humanizing " paul . paul such tremendous apostle start christian church . i think hopkins given us , this film , look paul truly shows his human side . i tried understand what might paul " thorn flesh . " maybe it his arrogance ( he stated himself ) . i've always thought it possibly some physical impairment but after seeing this movie , maybe it more pride , etc . interesting perspective . anyway , i highly recommend movie . it shows some what bible describes relationship peter paul . film stays pretty close what bible describes ( certainly taking little artistic license ) filling some places . even though very well .	1

olivia really first queen music video . olivia first artist film music video each track studio album ( physical ) .. olivia sexy , sultry made some great dance tracks 80s . like madonna , she would reinvent herself .. late 1970 , she came scene " innocent country girl " many hits such please , mister , please you ever mellow ( which , surprised me , not video clip included video gold dvds-i'm sure there footage her out there performing this song tv show like dinah shore , johnny carson or merv griffin ) .. then , her good girl gone bad role greatest broadway film version grease , olivia used role help reinvent herself into sexy , sultry pop performer song little more love her totally hot crossover country pop release .. she then starred futuristic disco movie xanadu recorded some her best work elo backing her movie title track , suddenly magic ... then , she moved into 1980 great physical album new look utilized music videos promote album . she even great concert aired pay tv ( i remember it pay station called preview ( this pre-cable sattelite = now , i'm dating myself ) , which clips it found these two dvds . then , olivia released greatest hits , vol . 2 tow awesome tracks tied up heart attack . almost simultaneously , i remember olivia starred travolta movie two kind olivia recorded some her best work soundtrack ( twist fate) = but something , or someone happened ... madonna !!!! madonna new face body full sexuality new sound .... yes , olivia try go toe toe her sexy soul kiss release , but songs weren't good ( mostly becuase her best songwriter , john farrar wasn't mix much new material ) i just remember culture shock just wierd song felt like it " shocking " song used out desperation compete likes madonna ... rumour kool , penned elton john so can't we talk it over bed = olivia toned down her sexy image her soul kiss days = she remained sexy , but started throw some her " innocence " again ... later 90 , she released warm tender , going back her " innocence " days ... then , later 90 put out great hits package awesome dance track i need love .. why she didn't release full studio album material like this , i don't know = it surely would made her come back strong dance charts could up there cher ... finally , she went back country remade i honestly love you .... so , all this , olivia definately one original divas ... she her time place made pop history her great music innovative , pioneer her music videos . i think olivia should dance album use songwriters producers currently worked cher kylie minogue = = if she , i feel it would make her megastar again put her top again ... oh , yeah , dvds ... i psyched when i saw these store !!!! it 99% her hits ( like i said before , doesn't include you ever mellow ) ... but , i complete collection physical , twist fate soul kiss videos , plus other promo videos clips her olivia live concert paytv .. i loved olivia , i still play these dvds alot . i actually give these dvds 10 stars !!!!.. they memory lane me -- time before madonna heyday mtv .. olivia original video diva !!!	1

there old saying , if you nothing nice say , say nothing all . but i feel compelled critique this film , partly because i really liked what i think it trying say ... follow your heart , not what necessarily popular , follow bohemian lifestyle if what makes you happy . o.k. this film instead comes across one produced major corporation get us all thinking heading back home suburbs . because really what it saying even if you all idealism world , it only land you ghost town like woodstock , n.y. , full self doubt , hypocritical trappings . first all acting not bad , i no issues acting . fact other fine actors this film , colin farrell should angry . their true abilities developing characterization seem written , directed , edited right out this film . there little or no subjective viewpoint these characters lives . viewer left outside looking , wondering where these characters coming , or what they motivated . this film forces us assume everything order believe anything , without dramatizing or exemplifying why these characters feel way they . effect clear , screen-writer director apparently anesthetized these characters into poseurs masked sterotypes ; only thing left certain , only thing derived , they truly believe hair color , haircuts , one-night stands . " home end world , " wants us believe it making liberal statement , wants us swallow whole enchilida . using home metaphor terminal disease create sympathy itself , what this film really lead us down road good intentions home decorated bad taste .	1

this amazing work art . must buy anyone who loves westerns . ( anyone who loves sergio leone already it . ) documentary interesting also . it all testosterone , however , so if you not like sort thing ( not necessarily your " chick " ) , you hate this movie not appreciate art . if you liked clint eastwood westerns ( especially good , bad , ugly , leone ) , this your next step . big characters big themes , big , but beautifully well . note : sound synch off my disk words not match lips . may part original , however , they not record sound set . not watch lips or you driven distraction	1
john barrymore over-the-top reading egomaniacal producer oscar jaffe absolutely brilliant howard hawks ' screwball farce . you basically just sit back awe barrymore improvises variety histrionics , facial contortions , animal noises , etc . times i thought he throes dts . if you find fault film story struck me little thin , despite adapted stage play charles mcarthur ben hecht . also , i thought carole lombard , lovely she former lingeree salesgirl turned toast-of-broadway , came off little shrill . it seems like she trying go toe-to-toe barrymore but didn't comiedic chops work . falls short classic status but deinitely should checked out barrymore performance	1
i think people way too hard this film . main reason people don'tlike it because they expecting lucas just remake original trilogy . what people not understand this entirely differnt galaxy we . entire galaxy changed enter episode iv . people don't understand it differnt age . only thing wrong this movie gungans , very minor annoyance	1

i thought this comes out movie muslim considering ways west finding them bitter sweet best . women often try take additional man prove themselves ennui they feel home not their fault alone . what happens they need theory life religiously , socially or nationally approved set rules management details . without such code we find out men get better without women around save they vile know something missing . take feminism british men can't bear responsibilities women regularly carry out respecting spouse career . woman talented but man just himself . my suggestion characters would bit humility less rage what they little ability change . they both people worth . perhaps back music jay perform , manage or teach perhaps writing or directing would suit claire	1

1950 version " king solomon mines " deserves full 5 stars if only one reason -- it one few movies even this day which set africa , filmed africa , features actual africans portraying africans . particular , dance scene near end almost quality ethnographic film , worth watching itself because lead dancer one finest you ever see . while it true this movie barely same story . rider haggard novel , only good thing , book racist unbelievably sexist even 19th century standards . plot indeed full adventure , but there several points where descriptions game hunting ( without even taking trophies ! literally no reason ! ) made me nauseous . all means , read it get taste 19th century british attitudes toward their colonies . it ain't pretty , today standards . whether you love or hate plot movie , this film , its way , little piece history . it true african actors aren't main stars movie ( though some them so charismatic they steal their scenes ) . but lest we forget , 1932 , only 18 years before , edward . robinson loretta young , boris karloff myrna loy all played chinese people ( " hatchet man " " mask fu manchu " respectively ) because god forbid hollywood would actually cast chinese actors . it would long time before african or african-american actor would considered big enough star draw mainly white audiences , but " ksm " step right direction it lot more engrossing movie because it	1
i not into this movie all . my mother recommended it me but it lame all way through . middle-aged man decides he wants something different his life , so he takes dance class . ofcourse there fine dance instructor , crush pursued , wife gets jealous , hires detective , * gasp * his crush found out . movie too predictable it just wasn't me . not bad movie , just not my cup tea . richard gere cute usual , which only thing made me watch it end , besides wanting know what correct quick step looked like since " so you think you dance " never contestants who mastered it	1

grudge american remake japanese horror film . what different grudge it non-linear story line . first you think it three separate stories , then just two , finally you realize your seeing interspersed storylines past present they meet end film -- filling you curse what happening . ( think momento identity)the scariest part story , it pretty creepy , because curse born first murder kills indescriminately anyone who enters house . not immediately . not same way . no matter what you , you can't outwit it . if you house , it got your number . scariest thing most people involved innocent -- they nothing original killing , when seeing ghost while shocked , they tried help . yet , still they died . there might way avoid curse but unfortunately , it didn't get carried ou t.t here no cgi/fx -- everything low key creepy . i'd almost say this more psychological horror than monster coming get you horror but never they less -- you'll probably end up sleeping lights wondering if you should evere go into house you don't know anything again	1

many ways , i don ' think sound exaggerate affirm it . day lives these emblematic integrants most famous band history , perhaps under perspective more than forty years elapsed , it may seen na�f picture if you want , but you should turn back needles watch set right moment ; perhaps most important aspect remark it allowed establish first possibility expression backstage , eventually would open gates future documents enormous historical transcendence .	1

biggest problem most people king kong its length , so there no surprise reaction general public release extended edition 3 hour-plus peter jackson film almost equivalent collective groan . surprise everything added extended edition king kong should never cut . more dinosaurs more creatures more action skull island only improves film , one wonders if these scenes cut mostly time pacing , why wasn't little bit 51 minutes pre-skull island snipped or perhaps few overly drawn scenes kong anna gazing into each other eyes ? more noticable scenes rampaging ceratops fun scene underwater monster attacking adrien brody co . while they rafting down river . bit more character development some seedy behavior carl denham ( jack black ) heroic deeds jack driscoll shipmates add bit flavor male characters literally overshadowed kong film . spider pit sequence also bit lengthened some more lines jack black . overall , worthy 13 minutes added material , but film still feels too long last act . special features this extended edition special features missing first release kong movie , including commentary peter jackson extensive behind scenes features , describing making kong concept artwork screen la performance andy serkis . i enjoyed extended cut , but i don't know this lengthy movie better served added material . it not like lotr films where additions enhance your viewing understanding tolkien world . but hey , i am not going complain more dinosaurs raft sequence i disappointed missing original cut	1
otto preminger directs this 1944 noir thriller starring gene tierney dana andrews . dana andrews plays mcpherson , hard-boiled detective investigating shocking murder society woman , laura , new york . mcpherson focuses waldo lydecker ( clifton webb ) , sardonic sophisticate who writes newspaper column radio talk show . lydecker good friend laura but despised her playboy fiancee shelby ( vincent price ) . process investigation mcpherson falls love laura portrait . fortunately mcpherson , laura returns -- apparently body girl found apartment not laura ! filming this story gorgeous black white cunningly utlized shadow threatens characters -- or reveals their underlying motivation . dana andrews ' curt athletic interpretation detective contrasts nicely talented vincent price who plays spoiled rich boy . clifton webb nice job poisonous , dried-out sophisticate . gene tierney laura gorgeous , charming elegant . unfortunately her character weakens rather than strengthens throughout film . laura starts out assertive individualist who challenges values sophisticated society . end film she docile female who found her man . story little melodramatic , all loose ends tied up too neatly -- good noir thriller leaves some mysteries unsolved . also , theme song little saccharine too often played . nevertheless well worth seeing enjoying	1

i purchased hd-dvd player this title mind it doesnt disappoint . this far one very best hd-dvd market date even tho brand somewhat new , still saying something there bunch beautiful releases already . this without doubt reference quality disc both terms picture , audio terms extras what hd format regular dvd cant . first picture what picture it . it flawless transfer absolutly stunning detail . amount grain perfect no noticable noise no edge enhancment visable throught entire film . skin tones beautiful colors accurate . one most impressive aspects picture rendition color black . black levels perfect plenty detail seen shadows . scene where he spraypainting his batsuit black spraypaint seen believed . i dont think i ever seen color black presented so perfectly home movie before there alot dark scenes this film so one reasons why this transfer so beautiful . there isnt single thing i would change picture . my hats off people charge this transfer , its one best i ever seen . audio , dolby digital plus track amazing but truehd track where this baby really takes off . if you own toshiba a1 you need update 2.0 firmware udate able use trehd its everybit worth updating . batman begins soundtrack awsome one general , very heavy bass it just wonderful mix adds extra oopmh action scenes like any good soundtrack should . truehd track it sounded simply stunning . dialogue easily heard without sacrificing any other sounds effects . overall its best truehd track so far again saying something training day awsome truehd track , it just couldnt beat out power this soundtrack . extras , presented all extras 2 disc special edition plus hd-dvd exclusive ime track ( in-movie experience ) . there some people who complained this ime track wasnt good some others because some pauses speakers fairly long . i 100% disagree this . when people ime track speaking non stop ime track runs non stop you never really given chance get into movie all your attention focused ime screen . batman begins they made it so ime track active during less important less exciting scenes inactive during exciting important scenes . what this allow you actually get involved movie while same time get information ime track during more boring less important parts movie . they absolutly this purpose you tell alot thought went into when ime should active when it shouldnt . end it unlike anything i ever experinced before commentary track when movie over i felt like i not only just seen ime track but i also watched movie . it awsome really me sold ime . i thought ime might kind gimmicky when ifirst got into hd-dvd but it couldnt farther truth . ime future commentary tracks there really no comparison ime old style commentary . so sum this up , batmen begins must buy if you own hd-dvd player . its one best super hero movies ever made this hd-dvd transfer best it ever looked . put big dose amazing sound big dose ime top you what arguably best release so far hd-dvd . its releases like this make me happy i got into hd-dvd right off bat without worrying damned format war . long hd-dvd keeps performing this level , i hd-dvd supporter till end . orangecrus	1
i first heard jean-claude brisseau secret things eminent film critic roger ebert , who reviewed movie one episode his ebert roeper show gave it thumbs-up , saying it one those rare erotic films also well-made fascinating . 19-year-old horny college student myself ( hehehe ) , i became rather interested seeing this film when it came out dvd . now i , my reactions it decidedly mixed . i frustrated while watching it , but after it over i rather admired it its sheer ambition . secret things basically two women attempt try climb up business ladder company seducing their way up . seems like simple-enough plot ... except , hands brisseau , it leads twists turns best described surreal over-the-top . what turns out unassuming little drama sex power becomes what you might call morality play , one heavy atmosphere symbolism . who would known scene which one characters sits chair her office quietly masturbates front her boss would eventually lead scene set what seems like some kind mansion/dungeon which lot people engage mass orgy ? it wasn't i necessarily minded brisseau blatant descent into this kind expressionism ; my problem simply much it came seem too pretentious . increasingly heavy-handed dialogue , portentous baroque music soundtrack , all-to o-o bvious symbol woman draped black bird her right shoulder --- all reeked writer-director seemed too much love his own wit . there clever , then there too clever , brisseau flirts frequently coming off too clever his own good : all self-conscious trickery risks obscuring whatever message he trying convey . it if he laughing fate his own characters , keeping his emotional distance he eventually destroys them . all may sound like i not like this movie very much . yet , after i finished watching it reflected bit upon it , i realized what perhaps brisseau getting all this over-the-top style . movie first seems female empowerment , two main female characters nathalie ( coralie revel ) sandrine ( sabrina seyvecou ) hatch their scheme try get top . but secret things turns out something little more universal little less gender-specific : it how quest power corrupt soul , make you little less human . perhaps it telling sandrine , who admits she never come man , finally reaches orgasm evil christophe ( fabrice deville ) , arrogant , cocky young ladykiller who all set inherit business his ailing father . sandrine herself gone so far her quest climb corporate ladder process she loses her innocence ideals love rejects delacroix ( roger mirmont ) , her boss office , mere " weakling " instead realizing he truly love her . nathalie , other hand , starts out cynical love movie , but slowly starts shedding cynicism she starts falling love herself . ending film , contrary what some people said it , perfectly logical context brisseau exploration search power highlighting dark night human soul . end , i began put pieces this movie together , i began develop some more admiration what brisseau pulled off secret things . power corrupting force not breathtakingly original theme movies ( look what happened tony montana brian de palma scarface ) , but brisseau explores it daring , boldly original , even relevant , way certainly fascinate you even if it occasionally frustrates you . most viewers probably find this film overheated almost insufferably pretentious ; but , look little deeper , perhaps style film its substance come together way make you respect it , if not necessarily love it . i think secret things worth look , despite reservations .	1

raging bull #24 100 best american movies ever , it among 1000 best movies dvd peter travers . later named best movie decade ( 80 ) , which i think true . i rate this movie 5 stars or 9.5 /10 . it nominated eight 1980 oscars , but won only two : de niro best actor , thelma schoonmaker her editing ( academy seems problem scorsese ) . schoonmaker appears one audio commentaries movie , martin scorsese , producer , real lamotta others . this dvd exactly what we collectors like special edition dvds . package beautifully ( yes ! package matters lot ) , containing small booklet some short essays pictures movie . then , this special edition comes second dvd full special features , such 4 behind-the-scenes featurettes , making documentary , trailers , some other very interesting stuff . this movie masterpiece . acting perfect , i don't only mean de niro , who got oscar this role my opinion one best actors ever , but joe pesci , who always sensational , cathy moriarty role vickie . shooting black white very wise decision , photography michael chapman , music ( cavalleria rusticana fits perfectly ) , editing got oscar also great job well , story , screenplay , even fight scenes just absolutely amazing ( i just hate violence ... ) . new york times put it " though it movie full anger nonstop physical violence , effect or raging bull lyrical " . i recommend this movie absolutely everybody . you like it sure . if you , get this special edition ( though while i am writing this review , it looks it not available anymore amazon ) . p.s. if you like my review vote yes . you read all my other reviews if you wish . i modestly write them help people form opinion movies , music books , but if nobody reads them ( if you don't vote i not know if you ) there no point writing them : -	1
flatliners horrific exploration after-death experiences , directed taut suspense joel schumacher ( client , batman forever , lost boys ) . it five medical students led kiefer sutherland ( lost boys ) carelessly experimenting death . each wants turn one time they bring each other brink their medical know-how , reviving volunteer within seconds - first , then daring each other go longer periods minutes . after sutherland experience he finds child his past haunting him , but hides his hallucinations others . william baldwin ( backdraft ) goes next , after his experience he sees reflections his sins - selfish promiscuity , primarily - everywhere around him . kevin bacon ( river wild , white water summer , stir echoes ) next , before results first two revealed , then julia roberts ( pretty woman , conspiracy theory ) , who insists her turn spite growing fears others . fifth member their group oliver platt ( simon birch , time kill ) . original idea , time film created , fascinating well scary , precursor such later efforts white noise . unfortunately there great deal foul language , considerable violence , unnecessary sex partial nudity ( particularly illustration baldwin case ) . i say " unfortunately " because otherwise i'd like show film everyone , idea so good , effectively delivers good message - " everything we matters . " but it , it not suitable children , certainly offensive many older viewers . if you're not bothered very r-ratedness , or dare watch spite it , i recommend movie whole-heartedly	1
" ring two " stars naomi watts david dorfman reprising their roles rachel aiden keller , family plagued samara morgan , demon child created video tape after death showed horrifying images killed viewers seven days after they watch it . original met great praise , labeled critics scariest movie since " exorcist " " rosemary baby " , even though i didn't find it scary all , just good mystery . " ring two " , rachel aiden moved new town , evidence arises local death may caused mysterious video tape . this inspires rachel , reporter , investigate . most critics don't like this film because it doesn't " atmosphere " original . since i've read books now how vastly different first second , i didn't expect it . you can't expect it , anyway , seeing how they two different directors . i'm quite sure this movie would better if gore verbinski direct , but studio hired director japanese film . it didn't work " grudge " it didn't work this , but it turned out better than what i expected . " ring " mystery video tape revealed , including where it came history who made it . ( though i admit , they could explained it better . book . ) " ring two " , we know what there fear so all there left throw it us see what happens . they try something new though , slightly resembles what occurs very end book , but much different happens middle . i didn't like how they just threw idea samara adopted us . i wish they explained it . they also kind overexagerated water . after fact villain later revealed , it kind makes sense but not really . i just hope fans react " dark water " well when they see it . i also really liked scene end well . there seems scene like end both them , one shocks you makes you flip out . ( first where she crawls out tv . ) all all , it very cool movie , one better ones i've seen recently . i'd give it 10/10 because it everything i thought it should . they close it off , but i still expect third . why wouldn't they it ?	1

director/co-writer/star jenna fischer may recieving end steve carell self-important antics " office " but " lollilove " she plays role akin carell egocentric boss show/ mockumentary goes after those who think giving charity ( individuals companies ) way gain attention , well mocking marriage jenna james gunn ( her real-life husband , hilariously playing germ-phobe who problems near homeless people ) . since this real life couple play spoof themselves one might fear film would cave itself lose its edge if film seemed far too " inside " come off its own exercise attention its stars . luckily film tightly wound around its premise nuances couple ( they're quibles times very rich hilarious ) you feel settled into watching realized characters rather than real people playing characters . great comedy deserves become cult hit . definately worth seeking out	1

this film creates impossible challenge this reviewer : convince one how important , even essential , movie coming terms not only modern art , but modern sensibility generally -- without however destroying wonder just viewing it . state ask trust , although such trust somewhat necessitated context : major american abstract-expressionist artist deserved reputation , although reputation virtually entirely established art world insiders would never established -- then , now , or perhaps forever -- general public . thus importance this film subject rests not only identity painter -- whose work and/or life one may or may not like -- but phenomenon elite art culture our time its paradoxical dominance wide open , democratic society such world never before known . there key paradox : film succeeds because aesthetic entirely opposed its subject : american realism . it if john huston or john ford persuaded make movie . obviously no one their type interested , so ed harris step it himself besides playing mercurial artist . couse he entirely uncannily subsumed role degree which just plain -- -- -- well , i cannot say it without destroying part your experience . please let harris it you himself . also marcia hartley who , turn , uncannily subsumed lee krasner . everybody else this picture , too . much commentary here amazon.com everywhere reflects fact our nation still often recoils realism , perhaps never happily embrace it . it our nation greatest gift , course , all artistic fields -- figures working against tide like pollack only underscore fact . however his artistic values , however abstract , really close 1st cousin -- absolute integrity emotion . you take or leave , too , there doubtless good arguments against it ( classic argument balance distance -- see titian portait doge venice , or sir joshua reynolds painting country squire ) but if you interested all american art or culture you better sooner or later know what counter view , just like you cannot study our history if you only read washingtons roosevelts , not custers or lee harvey oswalds . sum , without pasting too may more words over this immense wonder film , not assume it too overwhelming seen . just pick good night without distractions when you open i	1

moonlighting television show premiered march 3 1985 carried channel abc . it lasted through five seasons . moonlighting perfect example how good writing , talent chemistry come through tv viewers wanting more more one show . moonlighting also perfect example how top show reach bottom fail further please audiences , due lack commitment well evaporation magic chemistry . it long awaited event fans throughout world . moonlighting finally out dvd . personally , i it my videotaped versions show . i needed relive magic show beginning through help digital version . episodes run very wonderful it pleasure hear crystal clear musical theme every beginning . picture crystal clear audio digital stereo ( not 5.1 surround it stated technical characteristics ) . still , some points you notice audio changing stereo mono stereo again . issue comes up this dvd collection two first seasons fact some episodes altered . it seems ridiculous episodes altered when transferring dvd especially if you examine reason this . example , episode " funeral doornail " sex shop scene , there furniture superimposed front maddie moment she reading dirty magazine . clearly there no reason type censoring because front page magazine visible bit offensive prudish back `80s . there legal issue magazine this time around ? one only speculate . why they provide us classic episode " lady iron mask " newly recorded soundtrack ? it difficult gain rights musical themes played original episode ? people who new moonlighting such issues may trivial , but people who fond memories tv series such things matter . so what we ? we so anxious release moonlighting so we not stopped such minor technicalities . i rushed bought dvd collection two first seasons soon i could , not mention i already pre-ordered season 3 . no true fan left behind such treat their favourite television show . i need advertise show ? people who familiar there no reason all . this show many fans through out globe . i need advertise show younger unfamiliar generations ? surely enough saying television dialogue , character development television entertainment its best rolled into this old series . we only hope future episodes all restored their original form further more , there deleted scenes , there teaser 15 30 second tv ads much , much more . second time around doing professional job inclusion all this trivia because i am almost certain like me , great deal fans buy them all over again . just try keep away anniversary editions appear every five years include new item recently discovered . pretty much , i feel we all it predatory marketing started business trend during late `90s	1
this dvd compiles all . . . ' videos i.r.s. , well handful tv appearances . basically everything previously released succumbs vhs here , then some . " wolves , lower " performance video . this one suffers very low-budget appearance , but it rare interesting glimpse band its earliest stage . this only video until 1991 which michael lip-synched shoot . " radio free europe " appears here two versions , one some live footage cut one without . non-live footage shows band rev . howard finster paradise gardens georgia , which filled howard folk art massive junk sculptures .

" radio free europe ( live tube , 11.18.83 ) " " talk passion ( live tube , 11.18.83 ) " good performances band playing well . these nice because michael adds extra or different lyrics each song . " so . central rain ( i'm sorry ) " performance video band playing they stand behind backlit screens we mostly see their shadows . michael center attention only one not behind screen . he sings shyly his eyes closed . " left reckoning " 20 minute super 8 film shows band wandering around field full whirligigs ( building some their own , well ) . there lot unique start-and-stop editing makes film kind engaging . this set first half reckoning lp . " pretty persuasion ( live old grey whistle test , 11.20.84 ) " good performance , although not one better fashion statements guys . michael wears wristwatch necktie bill looks like french waiter . " can't get there here " hilarious due its ( purposely ? ) bad effects . band go drive-in movie get into popcorn fight . other odd images include michael greeting passers atop fruit stand band dressed bird costumes or playing horns . " driver 8 " kind boring video but interesting because there films projected wall behind band , much like they live shows . there lot railroad footage video go train-related lyrics . " life how live it " " feeling gravitys pull " sort part same video , which simply some very raw super 8 footage band performing one their live gigs . same editing style " left reckoning " .

skipping past my silly title , i actually liked this movie over arnold schwarzenegger first " predator . " while arnold incredible physique , danny glover more down-to-earth rely his wits more than arnold . danny glover plays maverick cop vein harry callahan clint eastwood dirty harry movies . danny hunts down columbian drug lords he runs across alien predator also hunting same columbian drug lords . while danny should happy someone else taking out columbian drug lords , apparently danny would rather it police instead alien hunter , so soon danny finds himself trail alien . original " predator " number plot holes easy ignore because nearly non-stop action . " predator 2 " even more plot holes , occasionally they intrude into action enough you pay attention them . perhaps biggest plot hole arrogance stupidity gary bussey government agent peter keyes . it seems action movies feds always end up portrayed too good everyone own good , including their own . if gary his team technologically astute they appeared , they should recognized alien could see their lights meat locker . while particular incident may biggest plot hole , there number others occasionally distracting i leave viewer discover . real charm this movie danny physically not match predator , thus must rely his intelligence thwart predator . predator clearly its own arrogance , which it ultimately pays , but way interaction glover alien provide some very good scenes . one scene predator danny glover very bad situation . danny able make use alien high tech boomerang weapon cut off alien hand . alien escapes into building across way . using cool looking colander alien mixes little glass some other ingredients make kind patch stub his arm . noise alien makes it puts molten glass ceramic its arm scares little old lady her bed , providing funny moment alien leaps out lady bathroom then her apartment , soon followed danny glover , who meantime found clever way get two apartment buildings . " predator 2 " not quite slick first " predator , " plot holes bigger . all , i thought " predator 2 " achieved more potential alien hunter than first movie , action more frequent more varied than first movie . first movie final show down main character alien , outcome just uncertain . while each movie its charms its weaknesses , i am sure some prefer first over second , i still think second lot offer . note there bunch versions this movie . sure choose version best meets your needs budget . enjoy !	1

if you follow my reviews , you know i felt version " jack ripper " michael caine inspector fred abberline phenomenal masterpiece . not only michael caine phenomenal role , but version offered convincing speculation mystery we don't know never . while i respect this version johnny depp , it more horror oriented . ( michael caine version more historical . ) onto subject hand . some you may know jack 5 victims . ( mary anne nichols , annie chapman , elizabeth stride , kathy eadows , mary jane kelly . ) well , they seem close friendship , we also get impression they share some dangerous secret . ( michael caine version , 5 victims knew each other , but they just associates . ) well , course jack ripper comes into play . one scene very well while we don't see his face , we see some disturbing pictures , we see him cutting his steak pouring blood red wine . comes depp ( inspector fred abberline ) . it interesting while older michael caine brought frustration tremendous energy role , johnny depp looks like his character living borrowed time going die anyday . but maybe depp didn't want just imitate caine . one thing i problem while caine some trouble his superiors , depp trouble his superiors blown out proportion . ( without giving story away , his superiors must known things they didn't tell depp ! least caine superiors carried some reason their side ! ) you'll probably notice depp finds things out much quicker than caine . ( probably because caine version 4 hours , while depp only 2 . ) while caine involved artist , depp becomes involved mary jane kelly . gradually , depp discovers things put together interesting puzzle . like caine his version , depp ironically gets close almost friendly killer . ( course , depp not know he talking killer . ) well , problem here caine version , we understand more why killer appeared normal even friendly caine . we never really understand here why killer friendly even helpful depp . ( jack ripper not same mental illness he caine version . ) i admit scenery well , elements horror there , depp good job not just imitating michael caine . depp sergeant godley offer some entertainment . but if you saw michael caine version , you undoubtedly miss quite probable historical accuracy . if other hand , you don't mind fact this version more geared towards horror than history , you'll probably find it respectable horror movie . side note : johnny depp makes inspector fred abberline look like he going die anyday . well , reality , fred abberline lived 40 more years after he stopped jack ripper .	1
i could ( ) watched this movie over over again . it great	1
when i 10 years old , i saw this movie first time friend house when there sleepover . it scariest thing i ever seen . even since then , it my favorite horror movie or dare i say my favorite movie all time ? i think so . it classic . when i bought it dvd i expected bare bones edition nothing besides movie . i wrong . i shocked when i saw documentary including interviews john carpenter , debra hill , jamie lee curtis p.j. soles , among many others . i pleasantly surprised director commentary well . i usually don't watch films commentary because i find it ruins film , but ... i'm so fascinated this film i see . i highly recommened this film anyone , horror fan or not	1

first one best thrillers ever , clever suspence , good characters , decent acting awesome effects . this one ... meh . why must you make sequel huge success hit turn franchise into straigh t-t o-video series ? what bloody point ? now there some good parts . rooms pretty nice musice score decent , but you know , doesn't even save it . this movie annoying , pointless downright piece crap only kids easily love . it so un-intelligent it really makes you wanna puke . characters nothing but cardboard cut-outs . i don't even know them well . all they scream , run around cube rooms cannot keep their mouths shut . i also really hate effects this one well . they felt like they over-used . there even scene where guy gets cut into peices look how badly it . direction ok , but when it comes adding wierdness , it too much . i don't understand story , there strange sex-scene which cube movie not need . cube suspence . this one just adding too much effects , four-dimensional cube trying make itself look better than first one . you don't need stuff . if you wanted make sequel better than first , add something original , don't take itself too seriously make sure it stays true original . but no , you just add all this unoiriginal time crap alot special effects taking over even sex scene which not cool because if it cube movie , you don't need nudity . overall , if you wanna kill off some time watching this crap , go ahead . i know you like watching people getting killed unoriginal ways watching sex scenes . if you're fan cube , dont ' bother . acting : 3/10ugh , don't get me started . these actors bad acting skills i hope they die . gore factor : 4/10cgi gore ?! come !? ta : 1/10a cube movie doesn't need nudity they don't know because they don't know cube . direction : 7/10andrzej sekula some visual eye some parts . i enjoy few scenes i dug rooms , but you know , i can't say he great director . he turned franchise straigh t-t o-video written all over it . bottom line : if you wanna watch , go ahead , then you'll sorry . this movie just sad . it doesn't try anything impress you because it idiotic . lets hope andrzej sekula learned his lesson should never sequel impressive indipendent film again	1

brad pitt angelina jolie star this action-packed thriller rather unorthodox married couple who very unique occupations . pitt jolie star john jane smith . both attending marriage counseling work out problems their marriage . jane works computers , while john works architect his friend eddie ( vince vaughn ) . they dinner each night 7 pm , neither much say . they live nice neighborhood friendly neighbors . but reality , there much more than meets eye . unbeknownst each other , both cooly lethal , highly-paid assassins working rival organizations . they both assigned same target , benjamin danz ( adam brody ) . both john jane show up intercept point , but reality , benjamin used bait draw out both john jane . organizations found out two married , there orders kill both them . jane soon discovers john one who foiled her attempt get benjamin , now she set her sights taking out her husband . what happens now battle among husband wife see who survive . john manage escape his wife ? they both realize they used bait much larger inter-organizational battle ? john jane join forces save each other ? i thought this very good movie . story very well-conceived . there lots action scenes , guns , knives , explosives , narrow escapes . there even elevator crashes ground top building . brad pitt angelina jolie perfect together , film keep you your toes throughout . i highly recommend this action-packed movie . this movie gives new meaning " till death us part " .	1

first , i give this 5 stars because subject matter subject matter importance , supplemental interviews dvd extras ; but not quality documentary filmmaking . more moment ... subject matter very , very , deadly serious . easily most important subject matter this decade certainly one top issues last 40 years . regardless whether you consider yourself one political camp or , or neutral ; you should know documentary looks both individual , very personal concerns such mother who lost her son war , also examines much broader , political economic aspects questions deserve attention , intelligent , calm discussion . **** even if you seen film disagree , you should watch dvd supplemental footage . if you miss these additional parts , you missing 50% information . please see #2 belowand if you critical main documentary viewpoint , you may welcome fact supplemental material largely unedited , running footage devoid any particular viewpoint film authors . this documentary well deserves praise one first approach this subject time when virtually entire western world media would not ( or could not ) go near this topic . when national fever high any questioning war effort considered " treason , " " unpatriotic , " " morally wrong ; " our constitutional rights such free speech free assembly serious danger . documentary portrays this , but ( unfortunately ) only sidelight fashion ( one many problems ) . fact , i'm not sure filmmakers realized this one greatest overriding issues . if common citizens better informed , insane actions atrocities would never happened . yet , documentary displays this serious , national problem absentee press graphically without any possible misinterpretation . both within us other parts world , censorship denial taking place . but it doesn't make points strongly or clearly enough . because this film its issues seen now tens millions , it part our culture effect growing . dismiss it without seeing it its entirety ( plus supplemental materials ! ) going cast doubt anyone who tries discuss documentary but doesn't know firsthand how information presented . basically , you can't attack documentary ideas unless you watch documentary . hearing it your uncle or coworker not acceptable working knowledge . furthermore , since these gigantic political life-threatening issues , every citizen duty informed possible . we can't country goes war , invades 2 other countries , kills permanently maims tens thousands its own soldiers tens thousands citizens other countries , puts 20,000 + jail six+ years , commits acts torture thousands , then substantial part its own population refuse consider this right or wrong , refuses spend 2 hours their time watching easily available documentary might shed new light or viewpoints this situation . said , michael moore his filmmaking team documentary skills decisions sometimes good , but other times quite poor . this documentary several problems , these nothing facts correct or other content issues ; this strictly documentary filmmaking * process * decisions made creation this work . -- big problem #1 : if you film titled " fahrenheit 9/11 " , don't start film discussing presidential election questions and/or irregularities . any filmmaker knows every minute , every second , their footage precious , especially first 10 minutes . documentary our nationwide election problems just fine . but that documentary ; maybe really good one , but i don't think it should included , except perhaps end . starting off material not directly related 9/11 attacks , mr. moore given his critics ample fodder criticism rejection beginning , even if reason rejection flaws . this decision huge presentation blunder , stole precious resources could used set up structure rest material , prepare audience what ahead . its final form , this information irrelevant next 90 minutes barely remembered after it all over . -- big problem #2 : mentioned above , filmmakers not appear good grasp subjects they documenting , there no strong sense what important what not . results missed opportunities , barrage information , lack clarity . information not well organized , it not summarized or reviewed times when new viewer needs time catch their breath . this problem editing pacing ; understanding how viewer or audience mentally keep track everything . doesn't mean material incorrect or faulty , it means it assembled presented poorly . comparison , i'd say it like reading book starting last chapter , then backing up one chapter time . sure , you read book all words , but people , information , story , connections going lot harder put together kind approach . we see lot really important information . there no doubt . but what most important points ? you might name 3 , but someone else might name 3 completely different ones . both would right ! however , this shouldn't happen if documentary well made . -- big problem #3 : film doesn't possess good structure . it not particularly linear piece , neither it follow several simultaneous information or storylines . it doesn't " scientific " approach or any other good format . instead it assembly line data but fails add up finished product , following this analogy , some information falls off assembly line easily forgotten . again , this doesn't mean data wrong , this mistake filmmaking ; all fairness , it sort mistake one would expect someone not well skilled creating documentaries . it not amateur , but it not tight coherent either . material both dense emotionally explosive , hard digest , especially if you aren't familiar all facts . but presentation doesn't work help viewer through this , connect many pieces information or give time pause review . instead , presentation relentless zigzag structure which takes away power material rather than combine it something stronger . instance , we see critically important censorship denial part media , but it not brought into sharp mental focus amongst all other information data , neither implications this media black hole . this needed stronger , more focused presentation . great crime war " freedom " denied " freedom press " very likely lost many viewers . add this seemingly never-ending series musical jokes segments , which i can't even guess their purpose . here we watching this [ literally ] deadly serious material , suddenly we silly rock music images , like some low-grade music video . this type decision truly amateur pathetic ; just shameful people joked . if documentary filmmakers don't treat subject seriousness , how they ridicule other people ? but this documentary shouldn't jokes . fact , no " true documentary " would ever take this lunatic approach , this behavior easily opens up entire subject ridicule . it incomprehensible how any documentary would created this type approach . shame producers , distributors , anyone else involved production not stepping forward " telling emperor he no clothes . " this juvenile , dimwit approach disgraces production insults everyone who suffered craziness " fahrenheit 9/11 " . this should never happened . -- big problem #4 : every moment film should runaway crazy " fahrenheit 9/11 , " but it isn't . example , president bush bangs podium exclaims usual nonsense terrorists hating freedom hating american goodwill . so why not show real reasons ? like fact united states sold arms iran iraq they fought each other years ago , creating immense hostility throughout middle east towards us ? little information , either remind or inform viewer real reasons hatred goes long way proving how we received endless stream lies misleading information entire situation . better yet , since you doing documentary , why not ask variety experts subject , them explain agree or disagree " terrorists hate america freedom " . instead , precious moments documentary stolen largely dead or irrelevant material , such when michael moore stands outside saudi embassy secret service coming ask questions . it interesting , but belongs supplemental materials section . not something qualifies national hysteria or " fahrenheit 9/11 " . it opens both michael moore his entire team criticisms grandstanding trying performers part story instead good documentary filmmakers . here one most important things you should know : original film documentary , we see us military raid civilian home suspected harbor terrorists my utter dismay , we see supplemental materials this part much larger story 10 times much impact , disgusting , barbaric outrageous disrespect ordinary citizens our soldiers . unfortunately this lost jumbled original cut . swedish reporter us military unit tells us no one , including swedish media , would present this shocking horrifying behavior . furthermore , only supplemental material lets us idea type documentary footage michael moore his team work . this well-documented sequence swedish journalists , we see one our military units invade ordinary family home our soldiers physically mentally abusing terrorizing ordinary citizens , including tormenting crippled old man . apparently they didn't understand its importance . then ! ... we find out one soldiers drunk , soldiers hit old man penis repeatedly , this all happens commanding officer watching calmly side . why earth wasn't this included main documentary ? this isn't bad abu ghraib torture sessions , but it dynamite material nevertheless . then we told this not anything unusual ; fact it commonplace ! showing our military behaving like this extremely important footage , shows why people iraq middle eastern world learned hate united states more more each year . yet , this crucial segment poorly presented largely lost original documentary . compared some segments mentioned above , this clearly more important . but , it cast aside . i cannot understand this . it hard speculate , but if this left out , we ask ourselves what other material discarded ? this , unfortunately , just plain bad decision-making documentary process , real lack comprehension part documentary filmmakers ; poor workmanship compared other documentary work . -- final thoughts : this point you may think my opinion documentary poor maybe not worth viewing , so let me avoid film mistake summarize this : this exceedingly serious important documentary , i recommend it supplemental materials anyone who considers himself good american , moral conscience , or anyone who interest american politics actions . you don't agree but you should familiar material see all i t.t hat why it gets 5 stars . you need watch this . however , i'm very critical documentary skill , or lack thereof , much better threfore less controversial documentary could created same materials , might more positive impact received wider acceptance . even so , this needs seen . if you confused how i give five stars something this many problems , let me repeat just delving into this subject national , political environment time its release breakthrough revolutionary . it would " great " hands others	1
so , i saw this movie once ... it guy it ... guy who always grey hair ... it julia roberts . first off ... i want make two things very very clear . if not one specific scene ... i would given this movie one star . so , anyway , it movie this guy who falls love this girl , because she really really beautiful self confident , but then he finds out she married this really big fat guy too ... who way way older than her , way richer than he . so then he all broken-hearted .... so then he sort goes through this flower period , where he realizes he wrong he needs sort ... re-birth . he ... he becomes this really amazing sensative guy , travels all over globe search meaning world peace . then , while he feeding starving children africa , he meets girl some swanky hotel where he giving one his peacful speeches . she sees man who he turned into ... so different skinny little boy next door who threw snow balls her way school . least , that what i feel happened inside him . because when he sees her again he feels like different person since last time he met her . he didn't really go africa all , but that what movie trying say ... his heart , become better person her ... he went africa.it really really touching	1

this film made brigitte bardot legend . i admit : i tried look this film objectively i find it alternately demeaning , silly , just plain dumb . so how come i'm giving it five stars ? one word : bardot . if you assemble dictionary would use visuals illustrate various words , bardot mambo sequence would authoritatively define word " sensual . " pulsating sound bongos background punctuated blaring horns , brigitte larger than life dancing room room like woman possessed . this may not acting but it sure holds your attention - kind like watching human transform into wild animal . this sequence tells you all you need know why bardot legend even her senior years . no , i don't believe god created woman silly ending which we expected believe few slaps jean louis trintignant enough turn bardot into submissive french housewife . other hand , i don't think audiences 1950 ready deal reality sexually liberated woman like brigitte .	1

ok , get things straight , only reason i ever bought this movies joseph mazzello name front . this actor , always , gives stunning performance , reason u should view this movie . mary elizabeth mastrantonio gives good performance also struggling single mother . script starts really nice promising , some intelligent thoughts combined funny moments , however , time it ends you start wondering what point . end , my opinion ( although maybe i'm way too cynical therefore subjective ) not satisfactory . it clearly addresses child you , it just it address 4 years old child . this after all family movie , one watch your kids nice cozy living room afternoon when there nothing else better . problem i'm not sure kids would really wanna go through first half film ( although u ) time it reaches end , addressing child supposed watch it , u suddenly feel dumb even sticking whole story . however , if u disregard end imagine tom meeting old jack , this movie could quite enjoyable . other problem patrick swayze . now , i haven't seen other movies he starred , but here ... makes me wonder whether he good actor . maybe he just wasn't part , because i can't sence chemistry him ms. mastrantonio , let alone joseph mazzello ( which chemistry film supposed rely upon ) . he just doesn't fit part . but again , if you disregard this also , you draw something out this film . i said it worth buying just this your joseph mazzello collection , because ending scene , 12 years old tom riding bicycle where main character departs , heart-breaking . how 12 year old child ( supposing he 12 then because it looks like ) pull off beyond me . i think we expect great things him . kid plays his brother overall cute , which exactly what he supposed throughout film - make u feel sympathetic towards him , so no objection there . third problem score . quite frankly , stupidest music i've ever heard . so i said if you're fan mr. mazzello get this movie , if not , well then what u waiting , but start something different like cure or simon birch . if you fan mr. swayze ... i ask why ?	1

let it written , this how television ought made . scripted , staged acted apex success sophistication , i never my life lucky enough see anything like quality elizabeth , bbc very fine 1970s miniseries chronicling more well-known aspects life queen elizabeth 1 . set across series six two-hour plays , story follows young protestant princess elizabeth , disowned shut away while her catholic sister mary takes throne . her subsquent release coronation set stage more eventful , treacherous successful aspects rest her reign - her failed romances , her successful campaigns , her would-be asassinations shot down - each captured so beautifully acted so convincingly completely enthrall viewer . glenda jackson magnificent , it rare thing indeed any actress able portray such age range ( sixteen or so well over sixty ) , , excellent makeup effects notwithstanding , it such consistency timing . jackson palpable skill total immersion such expansive archaic role superlative , sets stage series other quite brilliant performances names like vivian pickles mary scotland , stephen murray bloody-minded chauvanistic cardinal walsingham excellent daphne slater ill-fated queen mary 1 . such performances hand , bbc could forgiven staging productions shoestring budget , but happily this not case , historical detail abounds richness costumes , sparseness elizabethan sets overall sense moment history not forgotten modern researchers . where cate blanchett ' elizabeth ' ( excelletn film , too , but simply not this league ! ) flashy lush , contrasting sense lush spartan treatments some visuals ' elizabeth ' creates such sense period it easy forget this simply tv series . but that doing it injustice .

this very entertaining movie great car chase , gun fight , explosion , face off scenes acceptably suspenseful storyline . good acting cruise hoffman , i must say . however , you feel something missing . scenes memorable those i ii rare , if any . style j.j. abrams much weaker than those his predecessors . fact , he didnt leverage score all . short , disregarding mi label , it still outstanding action thriller . recommended	1
you see whole series understand , however i safely say you sophisticated type person , this interest you anime or not !	1
i recently found this two-pack bargain bin five bucks , lucy fan i snatched it up brought it home . well all i say i'm glad i only paid five bucks it . up side shows highly entertaining they highlight era television rarely receives it due , but down side tranfer looks like it pooped times all you see white screen outline lucy . but shows almost make this dvd good value , bottom line ! buy it five bucks . any higher it bad value	1
during my teenage years i fan wwf wrestling specifically , rock . he tremendous wrestler who fans admired right away because his talent extremely funny microphone cut some funniest , most disgusting lines ever mentioned wwf tv . his talent ring spot-on , rock would always give people everything he when it came time step ring compete . he rarely made mistake ring ... but he made huge mistake stepping away wrestling walking down path hollywood . it not doom really bad movie . sure , it movie considered disappointment right get go because no one wanted watch it movie theaters . it just normal , monster-shooting film delivers tiny amount suspense , that it . i'm sure movie would've big it released 10 years ago . todays generation probably sick go-nowhere do-nothing action films such doom . okay , so it go somewhere , but film isn't really designed build awe-inspiring creative story . doom kind movie you don't really want seek out- you just happen come across it video store decide you need quick 90-minute action fix , so you rent movie , watch it , then forget it next morning . course , i'm sure you don't forget rewind tape because that impolite . rock never should left wrestling . it bad career move millions wrestling fans ( rock means millions ) really miss him . come back home , rock . please	1

gift chilling tale set south written billy bob thornton , talented man also wrote sling blade . first off , it impossible anyone give this movie less than 3 stars . why ? because incredible cast . here , you'll find probably one best casts ever . it cate blanchett , hilary swank , greg kinnear , actor whom i can't remeber his name but who brilliant keannu reeves . keannu reeves ? good actor ? damn straight . he brilliant this movie deserved oscar nomination best supporting actor . i am not kidding . his performance remarquable ! movie widow , mother 3 , making her money psychic . but , she gets involved woman whose abusive boyfriend ready anything . this psychic scared mother only seems loved watched over one person . only one . you'll find one out your own . this movie packed suspense me edge my seat . so , watch this brilliant movie i definitely add my collection	1
i liked shows when 1st ran tv ; unrated didn't quite live up my expectations	1
i ordered this dvd basis some reviews - it big mistake . while terry dunn very relaxing listen obviously knows his stuff , quality dvd makes its all but useless training tool . dvd not permit selection section i want perform . section introduces you basic forms so washed out you cannot tell what foot hand positions supposed . finally , last segment where terry performs complete form , camera pans too often so you cannot actually see form start finish . sadly , i highly recommend you seek source knowledge this wonderful art . i know i looking something better .	-1

we bought this installment " disney treasures " series when it released late 2005 . my 9 year old son i just watched these cartoons again ( oct . 2006 ) we both love them . i would agree , however , those reviewers who noted visually cartoons this vol . 2 " chronological donald " not restored same degree perfection those earlier releases , including vol . 1 " chronological donald " release containing many donald world war ii cartoons entitled " front lines " . there clear difference quality , which apparent when donald cartoons previously released " front lines " repeated this collection compared cartoons new here . former visually superior , not because they better begin , but because they more carefully restored transferred . this shame . one hopes chronological donald vol 3 ( apparently not released 2006 , but perhaps 2007 ) there return quality vol . 1 " front lines . " one might even hope new , improved vol . 2 , but probably not cards	1
i havent gotten really , really good angry movie long time , course , it took film like troy remind me what it like . let me start saying if your idea good time brad pitt orlando bloom slightly misted sweat looking pretty , then turn sound down , grab bowl popcorn all means , enjoy this movie beautiful costuming , ignore rest this review . but , if you expect even one iota more out movie ..... dont waste your time .... i'm saddened fact i cant get 2 hours 40 some odd minutes my life i wasted here back . dialogue insipid ( they actually left line , " i'm sorry sir .... your wife left trojans . " film .... ) , everyone speaks british accent , except brad pitt .... which wouldn't bad if he wasnt star film . then there extras who play sailors .... who reasons i cant quite understand seem speaking greek .... when rest greeks speaking english british accent .... well ... except brad pitt . one scene , achilles ( pitt ) his cousin (?) sparr swords among majestic greek ruins next beautiful blue sea .... i actually hit pause scream screen , " idiots !!! it would building then ! not ruins ! " . real trojan war lasted over ten years .... this filmed version appears last two weeks ... days break here there allow main characters look suitably attractive beach ... you very little if any idea loss life each side .... short , this movie pure unadulterated drivel . youre asked care what began war ( you don't ) , you're asked believe brad pitt achilles smoldering brooding ( you can't ) , youre expected come away knowledge thousands years this considered greatest war all time ( you won't ) . however much spent making this film wasted .	-1
when i first saw this little film , it aired comedy central none fanfare it should received since it initial release . fact , office space reached cult status reason . it funny , witty , always makes you laugh . cast includes jennifer aniston supporting role waitress/girlfriend ron livingston character who epiphany during group therapy session . alex wentworth plays his girlfriend her shorter role . anyway , i don't remember man who plays arab employee friend ron character but he should applauded his role . newsradio stephen root should his own sitcom his performance milton , poor picked employee who reaches breaking point film . diedrich bader plays neighbor next door who offers wisdom ron character film . mad tv alum gregory herman plays colleague computer geek . mad tv alum orlando jones plays guy selling magazines door door . he turns out not person you think he . gary cole memorable performance boss who thinks he knows it all but doesn't know anything . movies like office space make me understand what we become those us office . imagine , if we just didn't work anymore . would heaven me	1
i'm those who saw this sundance , all things i enjoy gaiman mckean graphic novels display : quiet humor , intelligence , delightful weirdness , astounding visual vocabulary . except this case , words spoken good actors , all those visuals get up off their feet move . it hard describe impact watching mckean painting move talk . there might those who quibble movie looking too " animated , " but course that exactly point : create world make it dance . end result , visually least , like nothing you've ever seen before , absolutely worth seeing reason alone . some people i talked after screening also loved visuals but felt story bit dull , they seen it all before . well , it true story wear its influences its sleeve -- little " alice wonderland " here , little " time bandits " there , lot " wizard oz " over here , not mention resemblance gaiman own " coraline . " but i'm just familiar those stories anyone else , resemblances never interrupted my enjoyment " mirrorrmask " -- after all , it what you story determines its success . moment moment , there enough innovation cleverness , enough delight wonder , make movie positive delight . when movie came out theaters i went see it again , there little girl six years old row ahead me who sat through whole thing eyes agog ; then friend mine tried show dvd her young son but he got completely creeped out spider-thingie . ( hey , " wizard oz " moment when witch appears crystal ball exactly same effect me -- yet it lingered memory , when i got older i drawn back fell love movie . that how this stuff works . ) " mirrormask " probably little too wild full-out commercial success ; but i bet it going long , long shelf life dvd people pull it out tell their friends " wait till you see this .	1
good movie , i highly recommened this . action , intense , i know it isn't true but sometimes you just wish .	1

this kurosawa fist use widescreen , it looks glorious . while he managed simulate wider shots his past films academy aspect ratio , this , rife innumerable extras epic landscape , just awesome spectacle . like all good kurosawa though , story simple , elemental , yet definitive . two peasants/thieves absolute riot , mifune comes across amazing presence ... fantastically usual . criterion film justice excellent transfer , but little way supplementary material , especially when compared recent releases -- introduction george lucas this disk great though . price this disk , lack audio commentary , etc ... unfortunate . truly character driven story , film boasts people crass , yet lovable . not concerned apocalypse like kurosawa some previous later works , hidden fortress offers rousing adventure , which encapsulates classic story telling its stylistic best . such , this one favorites my personal kurosawa collection .	1
i saw last half hour this movie bravo network last week when i actually looking rerun " project runway , " so my first exposure it segment k-mart interview charlton heston . wow . i ended up grateful " project runway " wasn't . i made sure catch " bowling columbine " when bravo ran it again , so i could see whole thing . they showed it again last night . i say here , prior this , i'd never seen anything michael moore ( except one episode " tv nation " ) never interest seeing any his films because all negative things i'd heard , including things moore fans raved i thought negative , such way moore confronts people his films . what surprised me " bowling columbine " what came across me michael moore compassion . i really got sense he cared very deeply people who lost their lives through gun violence well people who lived unfortunate circumstances . i much greater respect him than i before i saw film . his motivating factor doesn't seem me so much political moral . he truly moralist . he reminds me abolitionists nineteenth century way . ( who awful lot people found annoying , if i need remind anyone . ) him , i don't think it so much " corporations other powerful entities evil " " people not caring other people -- especially people not caring those who less fortunate -- results separation hostility people , which leads evil . " well , shoot , they preach my church every sunday . , last time i checked , we weren't socialists . also : i heard , even moore fans , his interview charlton heston unfortunate embarrasing . but i don't agree . why shouldn't he asked heston why he what he ? why earth would heston gone denver flint after what happened ? i just don't understand it . some people said heston obviously suffering alzheimer incapable carrying interview . he seemed entirely lucid me . he lucid enough get up walk away because he didn't want answer questions . thank you , michael moore , leaving kayla rolland photo behind . maybe charlton heston took it inside . maybe it made some kind difference . peac	1
i've this dvd several months enjoy intermediate pilates workout . it only takes 15 minutes , so there no excuse not fitting it somewhere day . since i trouble sticking exercise programs consistently long periods time , that real plus me . don't worry speed routines . hello , that what remote control your dvd player ! just pause rewind until you " get it " once you all exercises then you'll really appreciate pace workouts because they don't waste your time . this bare-bones low-budget video production no fancy graphics or music , no sexy instructors outfits worn instructors look like they fifties . but i kind like narrator european accent sometimes stilted english phrasing , it makes me think he knows what he talking -- he sure isn't slick voice-over artist . i plan move into advanced workout level some point , but i am still working getting " perfect " position all intermediate exercises . it seems i still room improve my technique i'm no rush , since i am happy just exercising regularly . i notice my abdominal back muscles significantly stronger healthier . not only i notice i'm more comfortable sitting my desk during day work , but i more endurance recreational exercise , so-to-speak , emphasizes abs back . that very nice reward these workouts ! $15 or so , i gained steady workout routine stopped going pilates class my gym , where instructor not organized not explain well they this dvd	1
best psychological thriller i seen , this movie leave you shock end . smart cleverly written aussie leigh wannell james wan , directed latter , this movie breaks down all boundaries screen violence . starring wannell himself , his character adam wakes bathtub room no lights . he calls out help hears strangers voice , lights come revealing two chained shackled grimy , abandoned , windowless industrial bathroom . so game begins ... two prisoners victims serial killer jigsaw , well he really isn't serial killer we find out . he puts his victims through dangerous game test their live , its up victim if they live die . this movie one hell rollercoaster ride which appeal fans both horror psychological thrillers . it voted one most scary films all time , while i didn't find it too scary , its reality these crimes could happen anyone most frightening . filmed only 18 days , most it filmed warehouse , this quality filmaking young up-and-comer . many studios knocked this back which they surely must regret it went gross over 55 million dollars . buy it if you liked seven , kiss girls , bone collector red dragon	1

2 fast 2 furious one those sequels comes around every so often doesn't require you seen original . i saw this movie first time not too long after it came out , never seen original , i thought i would lost wouldn't enjoy myself much other people , but contrary - i left experience much happier than when i came . this film full quick one-liners deserve laugh . special effects car races leave your mouth gaping open . i heard read people didn't appreciate this film much because it seemed focus more plot than first film rather than focus more races , but overall , i think balance works well . even thinking plot we left , i really can't see time when race would even appropriate . people saying this film worse than original , i would disagree ... why ? frankly , i always firm believer than vin diesel entirely overrated actor . ( i mean , c'mon - you seen pacifier ? ) he nothing more than meat head who , while able pretty good fight scenes , should leave dialogue someone else . yes , this film younger crowd , there numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place ( take boat jumping example ) , but there no saying older person wouldn't enjoy it well ... only thing i say you really shouldn't go into this film expecting oscar worthy performance , or else you disappointed . if you sit back take this fun romp it , however , you thoroughly enjoy yourself	1
i really enjoyed this movie . it may not amazing , but it funny just deep enough pull you . it one those movies i like watch when i'm sick because it just makes you feel good	1

there not lot you need know thank you smoking , except it gleefully jaundiced , well-nigh perfectly paced adaptation christopher buckley novel . teacher who used lead class critical thinking , i took particular pleasure witty " spins " glib lobbyist nick naylor treats us he advocates big tobacco . sidelight : not one person this film actually smokes cigarette . special shout-outs excellent supporting actors david koechner ( gun advocate bobby jay bliss ) j.k. simmons ( budd " b.r.

i saw this long time ago showcase channel , heard it through local tv-guide-ish magazine . man , i blown away quality beauty this film . it man who one day claims he son god he bringing second coming . first nobody believes him , but then he starts performing miracles , people start realising this might real deal . i won't ruin ending ( it your job watch it ! ;) ) but part gets me every time . it true piece work , film deserves much more loving . it definitely worth your time	1
this one my favorite movies recent years . it gives funny realistic portrayal high school life need fit , well world high school cliques . movie , lindsey lohan moves chicago after home schooled africa her scientist parents enters public school first time . she befriends two groups : pair outcasts clique cool girls . she then finds herself torn them she tries fit somewhere . this movie , above all , absolutely hilarious . see it if you get chance .	1
it good season worth owning . i assume you already know this if you reading this . dvd set presented good sound , picture quality etc ..... however .... i really disappointed see warner bros . cheaped out english subtitles this time around . seasons 2-4 awesome watch subtitles hard hearing , it really helped comprehension all medical jargon spewed out 100 miles hour . medical professional myself , i got lot out this " special " feature . my fiancee , who not medical professional , found she able get lot more out show watching subtitles well . it definitely helps viewer appreciate complexity show writing . show still great . however , it inexplicable why we wait 7 months this dvd set come out when they obviously didn't put much work into it previous sets ( ie . they didn't want pay someone transcribe scripts sync subtitles ) . this especially irksome considering season 5 available dvd uk quite long while now . i just assumed warner bros . spending extra time cash job right north america . i wrong	1
i leave it others , better it than i am , detail story , actors , hollywood behind this wonderful film . what i need you understand film central theme , life handed us society , life we programmed into accepting unquestioningly unreflectingly one big fraud , more relevant today than ever . this film , more than any other , dares ask right question shows us one man search one right answer . it search tyrone power character begins himself , concludes world filled friends who live falsely rather than truly , chosen illusion happiness over truth possibility despair . take journey him ... you won't disappointed . life tirelessly struggling wealth , power , fame , pleasure cannot help us achieve real happiness , even though rule over us name order organization , structures society must their best convince us it . answer question , why we behave we , live we , got more than what we told almost moment birth ... why not . this film says , living good life , happy life means walking edge , walking tightrope illusion truth . we never hope get all way across , but , like any real-life tightrope , stop means perish .	1

almost everything this movie bad . writing side , there no plot , no theme , no characterisation . it like first , very rough draft , everyone involved convinced themselves so brilliant it didn't need re-working . it impossible tell , example , if father meant brilliant but fading , or just rather stupid impostor . he constantly makes references literary works he believes valid , he teaches creative writing , but none his comments any intrinsic value : it just what he personally likes or dislikes . so we're left wondering if we're supposed see him pathetic literary snob or guy who right . quite possibly , this confusion caused writer this film similar position . much this film like ' wonder boys ' without charm , humour , humanity , surprise interesting dialogue . it classic example how up its own arse so much artsy film-making . plot faults abound , e.g. others already pointed out absurdity entire audience not heard pink floyd song plagiarised son . morality making such young actor say stuff he shouldn't . . . . this country ( uk ) , we double-standards this sort thing , it looks like us may too . instance , here press slaughtered , continues so , gary glitter , pop star who found thousands pictures child porn his computer . rightly , his career ended overnight , press continued pursue him . contrast benjamin britten , classical composer . bb liked young , under-age , boys ; he wooed them , took them holidays him one case least , sexually abused victim point ruining his life . but his music still played , his reputation intact . fact , he recently book written him which writer ' explains ' his child-abusing not really all , because bb day it seen more companion/mentor kind thing . this film good example how double standards apply , both morally artistically , under banner ' art ' . but fact , it boring , witless , unrealistic , morally suspect , piece work whose only saving grace it short .	-1
george sluizer original dutch-french version vanishing ( aka man who wanted know ) offers one european cinema most quietly disturbingly anonymous everyday sociopaths , feeling his way one step time towards murder . if you've seen version , you probably still can't get final revelation out your head , but film plenty more offer than , playing chronology , subverting usual cliches its ' lady vanishes ' plot ( hero wants know what happened his missing lover far more than he wants her alive ) throwing some excellent characterization . i only assume this 1993 us remake sluizer so determined o-o ne else going get chance ruin his film when he perfectly capable doing it himself , but few people could anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work . his career never recovered . chief culprit astonishing performance jeff bridges overthought through every detail truly disastrous level . friend who produced one his earliest movies noted bridges great instinctive actor long you stopped him thinking what he doing , this film proof pudding . every movement overly mechanical its precision , making him look like rusty clockwork toy , while his voice bizarre mixture tootsie , latka gravas taxi dalek who all taking elocution lessons dok-tah e-ville . no banality evil here , just looney walking around invisible sign over his head saying " please . let . me . kill . you . thank you . your . consideration .

alan alda must feel blessed such integral part two greatest shows television history . creative forces behind west wing gathered their collective strengths gave series ending it deserved . decades now i'll pulling out these discs watching them . horror sadness we learned last december john spencer suddenly passed . west wing fans grieved sent their prayers behalf mr. spencer those who actually known loved him . we see some love respect gets translated show episodes swirl around leo death among most heart-breaking i've ever seen screen . when kristin chenoweth annabeth tells bradley whitford josh leo died her tears didn't look all like " acting " . same said expressions faces all actors leo funeral , ending martin sheen president bartle t.t he storyline this season centers presidential race jimmy smits portraying congressman matt santos against alda senator arnold vinick . this ticket clearly fantasy liberal writers even republican candidate pro-choice , insults some nra-type vigilantes all but thumbs his nose religious right . vinick campaign derailed somewhat aftermath nuclear accident california particularly shrewish right-winger brought help senator woo back republican base . ron silver continues his role bruno gianelli , political strategist who only cares winning - knows how it . patricia richardson effective vinick assistant who tries keep him track . janeane garofalo serves sparring partner josh lou , democratic operative who gets almost much pleasure seeing josh flounder ( which he inevitably brief moments ) helping her political causes . teri polo plays helen - candidate santos ' wife - this character always seems little less enthusiastic than would appropriate wife man who may become president . aside sensitive respectful way real-life death john spencer worked into fictional story , this season gets few other things right . where we may frustrated past lack love lives most these characters years - all service their country - this season we get see most principal characters hook up one way or . first daughter ellie gets married white house ceremony curiously missing both her sisters . ( although all three daughters make leo funeral . ) through their own obvious attraction donna persistence josh donna finally get together . opening first episode we're glad see flashback c.j. danny concannon married child , other episodes we get see danny gentle courting techniques one most powerful ( powerfully nice ) women world . it also gratifying see some " old friends " show up final episodes such rob lowe return sam seaborn . ( sam recruited duty josh scene pays homage earlier flashback scene season two when josh conscripts sam first " bartlet america " campaign . ) shows writers , directors , actors , professionals who shot , set costumed show : bravo ! i'll miss you dearly watch these shows enduring pleasure . pinheads who decided release these dvds without any significant extras : pox your houses . while first seasons came full sets subtitles , documentaries commentary tracks which performers , directors creators couldn't withhold their obvious glee - this season comes next nothing . first seasons came subtitles english , francais espanol . last two seasons not option english subtitles . what if viewer hard hearing ? what reason these deficiencies ? laziness ? complacency ? no doubt almighty dollar played major role . this show - this show fans - deserved better . rest well-deserved honored peace , john spencer . adieu , west wing .	1
this film beautifully portrays both tenacity human spirit dark brutality it descends like no other . compelling acting leading actress marina golbahari awesome any standard , so notable performances her on-screen friend played arif herati . this must-see anyone who wishes view tragedy oppressive taliban rule afghanisitan new , poignant human side ; all too often we become desensitised barrage carnage repeatedly shown mass media . this evocative film reawaken your sensitivities real human suffering taking place so many places world	1
i dont know what its like gone school 1980 or gone school united states but i still relate this movie . this movie could set anywhere any decade it would still tell same story , only fashion accessories would different . everyone seen this movie now everyone opinion it most say it really good movie . i would say it deserves called classic now . it may not laugh out loud comedy or very dramatic move little slow times , but it delivers its message loud clear keeps you engaged throughout whole movie . it gains momentum it moves end , after experiencing all emotiions you feel satisfied . small cast , all your attention focused individual characters . 5 students all completely different one all brilliant . each actor plays their part perfectly . while there large age gap them they all convincing teenagers fighting there own demons . they all probably most remembered this movie , exception emilio estevez , but special mention must go judd nelson who i believe biggest star film . his part originally intended either nicholas cage or john cusack who would also great , but i'm glad judd got his chance prove his acting capabilities . it shame dvd lacks many special features . all you get trailer cast bios , i desperately seeking audio commentary , or very least production notes , however there some interesting facts noted imdb . teen movie 80 generation , anyone born after film made probably not like it , but others who grew up around or just after it probably agree this movie indeed classic . 7.5 /1	1
viewing series 3 , i struck how well producers targeted all three series late 20th-century-middle-class-working-woman-viewer . house elliott all work problems : establishing career insufficient formal credentials , working man world , finding out who you trust business , working people you dislike who nonetheless valuable contributors business , supervising people who dislike each other , hit male coworkers business associates , juggling your demanding career often conflicting demands husband or boyfriend , juggling motherhood work , dealing creatively work emergencies . series 3 , lower-class working conditions , socialism potential solution , major new themes . there also more emphasis demands motherhood ( bea tilly babies ) previously minor characters , especially home lives house elliott employees . pace frenetic compared first two series , lots multiple plot lines quick shifts back forth them , unnecessarily dramatic camera angles , dropped situations , overall too much going . all characters make major life some cases personality shifts . tilly becomes clinically depressed . bea new boyfriend daniel rapidly evolves arrogant , callous , resentful , self-centered , exploitative jerk ( he even gigolo ) sensitive , caring guy who makes major sacrifices evie . evie rejected boyfriend miles apparently turns sweet , caring , sensitive , generous guy shark trying take over house elliott . this really science fiction series where their brains got swapped night ? every single one plots ends up cliffhanger . tilly norm become employed again ? agnes leave house elliott become full-time music hall singer ? jack succeed his new career socialist politician , bea able cope politician wife ? donald happy all sacrifices he made bea ? miles end up running house elliott ? many more . . . but most all , new rift bea evie ( who throughout this show always closer each other than any husband or boyfriend ) ever heal ? stay tuned series 4 : except , far i tell , there wasn't one . nonetheless , fans series 1 2 certainly want watch series 3 . oh , clothes great	1

you tell header , i disappointed this movie . since kurt russell plays lead , i should not surprised , because parts he plays generally rather predictable simplistic ( tango cash , snake plisskin , etc ) . i just don't picture kurt lead actor gritty , realistic drama ... but , eternally optimist , i hoped this might exception . it wasn't . story involves two la detectives , one grizzled thoroughly corrupt veteran ( russell ) other somewhat principled but weak-willed easily manipulated rookie , bobby keough ( scott speedman ) . russell character ( eldon perry ) controlled protected exceedingly corrupt superior officer , jack van meter ( nicely played brendan gleeson ) , who uses perry further his profitable flagrantly illegal interests . if you ever watched " shield " fx cable network then you familiar this general setup .... morally ambiguous detective used further his superior agenda ..... but here problem : shield ( television series ) vastly superior every way : plot , acting , characterization , dialog , direction , etc . this feature film . it like comparing filet mignon cheap hamburger . once you see quality , nuanced drama like shield , this movie all like it rendered unwatchable . characters dark blue caricatures almost no depth . they guzzle whiskey laugh their flagrant crimes . plot dialog contrived unrealistic . there no subtlety .... no intellectually stimulating complexity . eldon always exactly he told : if mass-murdering thugs ( employed protected his superior ) sheltered arrest , simply go out murder couple stray ex-cons let them take rap ( posthumously ) real criminals . never mind neither ex-cons even close plausible suspect . no one would fooled this ruse , except perhaps this mindless movie . eldon gets his partner keough perform one cold-blooded murders ordered van meter , thus begins their downfall , because keough spontaneous change heart suddenly cannot accept guilt his actions . one minute he guzzling whiskey his cronies laughing lying shooting review board , next he overwrought guilt . not all likely real life , but it suits plot . things gets even sillier when partner ( speedman ) then teams up assistant chief ( ving rhames ) predictably beautiful ex-mistress ( michael michelle ) try arrest real thugs use them bring down whole perverted mess . heaven forbid he simply come forth provide evidence accomplish this end . what follows lengthy , confused , poorly choreographed pursuit thugs predictable gun battle equally predictable outcome . ultimate farce , however , reserved eldon himself , who drives around south central los angeles during peak rodney king riots trying find arrest black suspect .... which he easily accomplishes .... then drives away without scratch . this reaches level surrealistic absurdity insult true horror riots . equally unconvincing eldon spontaneous change heart end movie , during his promotion ceremony ( such irony ) , when he delivers rambling , preposterous unconvincing indictment his father , himself , his evil superior .... which simplistically immediately accepted ( true movie fashion ) all who hear it , who then immediately jump arrest condemn naughty superior . this silly , implausible , insult any viewer above age ( maturity ) 10-year old . jump up your next promotion ceremony deliver rambling condemnation your superior see what happens . this type naive nonsense occurs only one place : movies .... bad ones . if you thrilled tango cash , thought snake plissken brilliantly-portrayed anti-hero , then all means hit " buy it now " button this dvd . but , if you want complexity , subtlety , realism , plausibility , infinitely superior acting , plot , characterization , direction .... yourself huge favor use your money either subscribe fx cable , or buy/rent dvd shield series .... filet mignon always better than cheap hamburger	1
some might suggest there now three things not discuss polite conversation : 1 ) politics 2 ) religion 3 ) viet nam . viet nam , battle would become known hamburger hill resulted over ninety per cent one american platoon dead . yet body count would still necessary see which side suffered greater losses . directing mass charges via waves infantry modern warfare initially chronicled during korean conflict only later officially recognized ' war ' . importantly , hamburger hill also battle before it made into movie also war named but never declared . overview , modern war , film-making or army life , " we soldiers " merits full consideration . mel gibson turns flawless performance walking point this sortie became first major battle viet nam conflict , later unofficially entitled " war . " one loses count important issues exposed this courageous work . many would ask , " so who cares ? " would garner first score gibson . author hal moore , whose " we soldiers once , young " basis this film , certainly deserves first bow initiating this work , though he might return horse laugh use ' bow .

this movie loaned me , ( thank god i did'nt rent it ) biggest waste few hours my life ever ! acting so horrible it made me cringe , cuts movie where it seemed like it edited tv . this supposed black comedy ? it not funny , so called violence it made me yawn , seriously , i've seen more gore simpsons . there so many things movie amazingly unbelievable , . sutherland walks miles hospital bullet through his neck , head , two bac k.r. witherspoon overpowers sutherland ( second time ) strangles him , pretty good 90 pound teenage girl huh ? but , i think everybody should watch this movie once so you see what movie should not .

all many many documentaries recounting despicable acts mass murder committed name allah day , this far most comprehensive most unflinching . because this , those whose mindsets side more terrorists find this factual documentary somewhat distressing its raw recitation events . perhaps none more so than " caesar " his review sept . 17 , 2006 . if only he found least troubling carnage , bloodshed , destruction deliberately perpetrated his islamic buddies against civilian populations . but , more this bit . regards this extraordinary video , perspectives air traffic controllers , faa officials , norad neads , air crews passengers board each four doomed flights , testimonies witnesses , participants , firefighters , all heroes near ground zero , this singular documentary takes you minute minute through hell deliberately planned perpetrated those whose religion them believing execution such hellish bloodshed granted them virgin-laden heaven . ( no ... this not " propaganda " or view documentary , but instead my own conclusions drawn many years personal investigation islam ) . anyone who , like " caesar " here , could watch this fully factual account then call such splendid documentary " goody-goody propaganda " " try(ing ) portray us good guys hit bad guys ... " reveals instead either their rabid religious fanaticism or otherwise their own anti-american hatred so apparently condoning such ghastly blood-soaked horrors acts " good guys " retaliating against " bad guys . " while " caesar " ( how telling nickname ) attempts school us ignorant americans our country past political-policy foibles , yet he fails mention billions financial economic aid we given islamic nations , millions military equipment technical advisory assistance provided them they struggled against invading soviet forces and/or other foreign enemies attempting annex rule over sovereign islamic nations , ousting kuwait brutal armed forces islamic fascist dictator who invaded then " enjoyed " weeks metaphoric all too literal raping this tiny islamic nation while openly looting , terrorizing , butchering , torturing , murdering its citizens while none its islamic neighbors lifted so much finger intervene , but instead begged united nations u.s. solve their problems them ... which we ! these just tiny listing far greater acts we cause justice good , all it islam behalf . yet , 9/11 only latest greatest terrorist massacre which we continue repaid bloodthirsty religion islam all we continue its behalf . " caesar " also glaringly omits all too conveniently ignores radical islam blood-soaked history their on-going policy religiously motivated bomb blasts , hijackings , kidnappings , tortures , rapes , gang rapes , female circumcisions , sawing and/or hacking off people limbs heads , mutilations , always ... mass murder after mass murder after yet more mass murder all perpetrated against civilian populations worldwide , including those their own religion , all thanks islam foundational tenets blood lust makes all such horrors not only acceptable but actually laudable , eternally rewardable , thus ... forever inevitable . true , all religions their radicals fanatics . but none deliberately attract , nurture , encourage terrorist fanatics more than islam . none preaches genocide against entire jewish race/nation all non-islamic " infidels " name god more than islam . it how this video accurately documents entire world only this latest greatest mass butchery name allah probably motivates " caesar " most attempt such blatant anti- u.s. propagandizing here . those who would disagree , i challenge " caesar " or anyone else provide us any reliable evidence even single factual error this documentary . what i think " caesar " fears most such powerful documentary this might add growing world view despite constant rhetoric islam religion " peace , " ever-escalating terrorist acts its leaders constituents name islamic religion reveal exact opposite true case . maybe it just me , but i'm thinking any religion so encourages its hormone-driven young men blow themselves up many " infidels " they so spend eternity orgiastic sex 72 virgins deserves fully prosecuted , very least charges " conspiracy commit ( mass ) murder " ! one thought just hit me : if more more islamics continue either commit or condone such bloodshed full approval their islamic leaders , which god they truly honoring emulating : allah -- creator life ; or instead , iblis ( satan ) , destroyer it ? their fruits they known , after all . question whom what islamics most worship adore , permit me close this review also this wonderful documentary , quoting one islam most renowned clerics : " we love death . u.s. loves life . big difference us .

this pretty good detective series . it better than morse not quite good midsomer murders . format very similar superior " touch frost " series . two stories these full length films intelligent , acting good . there three basic flaws : music sometimes irritating always too loud ; camera work often choppy gets way story ; some casting ( lead-athlete neighbor-hooker johnny swan ) weak . still , whole , this good entertainment worth price .	1
not quite up par original , this long awaited second installment ( not same thing sequel ) hampered interruptions when celebrities came on-screen discuss works . not only this my opinion disrupt continuity visual accompaniments some human species ' most beautiful music , but fifty years people aren't going know who most those by-then long-dead women men , this supposed classic ages . i also think fantasia 2000 missing delight elements abstraction darkness first film . finally i wish it broken mold modern animation hand-drawn painted , instead making extensive use computers producers so clearly . now , what this film right it really right . firebird segment absolute perfection thrills me each viewing , centerpiece film , wherein al hirschfeld-themed new york city panorama spreads out unabridged accompaniment george gershwin magnificent rhapsody blue , one love ! re-use sorcerer apprentice took up time might've made available fresh material , but seeing old favorite restored lavish color treat . some segments fantasia 2000 more uneven than others , but i don't think there bad one bunch . this , like 1940 fantasia before it , joy watch time after time . fantasia 2000 stands its own work originality , i hope third volume this series arriving soon	1
i netflixed this surprised results . cybil sheppard likable , but bruce willis , one whom i thought i'd like show abrasive ( not " fun " abrasive ) generally hammy . i could not like show because i could not like his character . worse still , chemistry two simply cold awkward . totally lacking spirit warmth remington steele miss laura holt . humor grating sometimes embarrassing . some reason certain shows just seem stuck time period they arrived moonlighting far one , uh , stuckiest . sound cues feel like they yanked terminator one ( not good thing ) . there brief interview section disc one where they brazingly put down other shows time period gloat how they created something " different . " if cold , dated , impersonal " different " than i guess they . i would wager many here who give this 5 stars viewed it its original time frame fans all , though i must say looking this outside , it quite honestly , train-wreck . i feeling show " could " get better but i won't around reset tracks	-1
other than breakfast club , sleepless seattle my all time favourite movie . i know it older now , but me i always watch it over over again . i like watch it couple times year because i always enjoy it never tire it . everyone probably knows , tom hanks his son move chicago seattle after tom wife dies they need new start . hoping find new love his father , jonah calls radio station speak talk show help his dad out . their radio call name sleepless seattle . listening conversation all way washington dc meg ryan who just announced her engagement bill pullman . she seems fall love sam ( tom hanks ) instantly she finishes his sentances hooked his story . writer , she story him finds herself wanting get touch him . she makes journey over seattle manages say hello him ( before almost getting hit cars busy road ) . she backs off after thinking he relationship already heads back home . all while through movie , these events parallel movie affair remember , so eventually there arranged meeting annie sam top empire state building valentines day ( sam hasn't arranged any this ; jonah all correspondance without his knowledge ) . long story short , you gauge rest story line . it fun enjoyable yes it chick flick but there nothing wrong tha t.t here some great acting it jonah ( ross malinger ) chemistry hanks ryan always great watch ( although they don't many scenes together ) . i really love this i don't imagine there great love story like this one . nora ephron great job screenplay i never get sick watching this movie . it really fantastic	1

movie starts off very slowly , childhood episodes ashton kutcher character . it least 1/2 hour before we see adult kutcher , although he appear very beginning brief scene . premise good , it some good momentum middle , which why i gave it two stars . shifting situations his life lives his friends interesting well , but overall story line very weak , ending dreadful not supported most rest story . also , movie too many tongue-in-cheek references kutcher real life circumstances -- such reference " tighty-whities . " they distract story , make movie more vanity vehicle -- which too bad -- if you not kutcher convert just looking movie , skip this one	1

" philosophers often behave like little children who scribble some marks piece paper random then ask grown-up , ' what ?

" i may well watched " elephant " again . if exploring suburban angst your thing , you might like this film . there better cooked stories out there , though . i watched larry clark " ken park " afterward , which like " united states leland " less wealthy neighborhood . both films depressing , but i felt so gross after i watched " ken park " i promptly returned it video store , showered cleaned my whole apartment . least i shocked into action .

this smart , well-crafted heist movie , which i enjoyed much more than earlier heist ( which just too overly self-consciously clever all back-up plans odd dialog ) . three main actors , brando , norton , de niro all turn exemplary performances , probably one only time all three ever worked togegther . watching de niro use all his safe-cracking skills fascinating , something most us probably know nothing . after all , one doesn't meet high-level safe-crackers every day . :-) safe-cracking scene thermal torch made some spectacular cinematography what all sparks , way de niro figures out how open safe so quickly inspired . commentary dvd , they mention that way it actually happened when they filmed it , it spectacular scene , but i won't say anything more so not spoil it you . but you'll see what i mean when you come it . ending also surprise , unobstrusive musical score adds drama some nice mood touches where they're appropriate . overall good flick worth your time money	1
there few more beatific images than youthful ingrid bergman framed her nun habit , looking skyward glistening candlelight end this 1945 holiday classic . director leo mccarey bing crosby reprise his role father o'malley their film year earlier , " going my way " . both really reflect type films would more likely show up tv movies family channel if produced today , but wartime audiences obviously need such cinematic salves . what reassuring how films remain affecting today if rather unabashedly sentimental . what sets this one apart crosby natural ease role ( certainly far more muted than he bob hope road movies ) incandescent bergman portray sister benedict . pacing leisurely , first part film establishes two stars their roles before going into slim plotline , which sister hoping rich curmudgeon named horace . bogardus donate new , expansive building st. mary academy take place rundown old building sisters schoolchildren inhabit . mccarey - screenwriter dudley nichols - both pioneers screwball comedy , focus lightheartedness story until couple sentimental developments occur . first lonely student named patsy , who comes idolize sister benedict , point intentionally failing graduate order avoid going back home her concerned mother estranged father . second involves sister benedict medical condition which forces father o'malley make difficult decision st. mary . there fewer songs here than " going my way " - title tune one , " aren't you glad you're you ? " , both sung effortlessly crosby swedish folk song performed warm alto bergman . soft-centered philosophical discussions two leads generate some interesting conflict though nothing feels irreconcilable end . there also some amusing scenes well , example , kindergarten class unaffectedly improvising christmas play bergman showing off her pugilistic prowess boy beaten up fight . while i much prefer bergman her more outwardly seductive roles ( " notorious " ) , i see why people wanted so much see her glowing embodiment good during wwii , even though it this image harbinger when she caught extramarital scandal roberto rossellini five years later . crosby always seems playing himself , which this case , good thing . henry travers , forever clarence me frank capra " it wonderful life " , plays bogardus appropriate stubbornness compromised regret , joan carroll , least prominent smith daughters vincente minnelli " meet me st. louis " , gives solid performance conflicted patsy . this understandably well-loved film even if it runs bit too long	1

movie : one boldest most interesting films early 90 , one deserved far more acclaim attention than it ultimately recieved , this smartly written beautifully acted film should seen any cinemaphile open mind . despite whining some , usually hardline christian , corners , it not anti-christian all . what it simply great , imaginative clever film making , superbly character piece centered around magnificent performance mimi rogers , ably supported likes david duchovny , patton patrick bauchau . i'm not going go into it too deeply simply because it one those films should seen experienced little up front knowledge possible . ( please note i'm not attacking christians or christianity above , just small , but , usual , vocal closed minded minority always gets up arms any film dares tackle any such subject any degree honesty instead going down traditional biblical fawning path . people who instantly hate film like this just " principle " then proclaim all they should avoid " such trash " . you know exactly kind people i'm talking . they're minority , they just happen very vocal closed minded one . none anything their christianity much it their absolute closed mindedness their fear anything dares stray certain comfortable path . ) dvd : good news , this film finally dvd , pretty decent audio commetary boot . bad news , movie badly misframed , which something becomes obvious couple key scenes especially . i'm not sure whether this form censorship ( misframing one scene effectively nullify sequence any real nudity it once ) or whether it just botched transfer , but it clearly misframed regardless i saw this film twice it theatrical run framing different now than it then . plus misframing quite obvious anyway , audio commentary you even hear remarks film pertaining parts print no longer visible due said misframing ( so clearly they watching film it proper framing ) . unfortunately this doesn't appear available anywhere else dvd , so if you want film dvd right now this your only option , just aware going , hope better release somewhere down track . apart framing issue sound audio quality perfectly fine , only other notable extra film trailer . bottom line : really good , bold , interesting film disappointing variable quality dvd . mr	1

federico fellini 1972 film not his best , when he 8 1/2 , la strada la dolce vita his credit . while many critics adore this film its absurdity plotless , dreamy structure , i found it boring phantasmagorical . it simply fellini version rome not rome , eternal city itself . risk sounding negative , i shall admit there some moments which it most expressive early 1970 rome - scenes which hippies american tourists invade city , long scene outdoor restaurant where everyone talking their heads off ( though saying some pretty vulgar things ) my favorite scene- underground archaelogical excavation which frescoes old roman patricians fade into oblivion . but mostly this film weak it bored me because there no plot . it starts off alright , movie works well when there no sudden fantasy sequences . fellini himself this movie , well gore vidal . fellini envisions himself young man studying rome his youth strict catholic school ( slide/projector shows ancient monuments like colliseum , apian way , trevi fountain vatican well offensive pornographic image woman behind ) later young man journeys rome itself takes residence large family crowded apartment slum . then young man sees talent show tasteless , vulgar long-winded . i found myself just unimpressed outraged audicences went far throw dead cat stage ! it bothered me there much attention prostitution , brothels or cheap , slutty women . cover film promiscuous woman start film . film rome italy , there hardly any allusion opera or any true classical theater . pope fashion show ludicrous blasphemous . only serious , hardcore fans fellini want own this dvd . it perfect follow-up his equally absurd sexually radical satyricon , loosely based old roman epic .	1

my son 11 months old we started out watching bear because it gave me 20 minutes " get-ready " time morning . now bear his favorite all playhouse disney shows . he could care less pooh or jo-jo , etc . this dvd gives 3 episodes where dancing key ! first episode each character playing instrument ( spoons , kazoo , rain-stick , pots pans ) part orchestra . second episode day supposed restfull one house , but treelo wants dance ! he gets everyone into mood they dance all day !

good western starring clint eastwood released 1985 bringing more developed plot variation " high plains drifter " released several years before . film benefits good screenplay script which there more well developed characters keep audience interested . film set small mining town where independent miners terrorized boss who owns mine adjacent town . clint eastwood rides into town " preacher " sides beleaguered miners against local boss . film remains mysterious whether " preacher " really man or ghostly apparition past coming claim revenge past misdeeds . town boss eventually hires crooked marshall his posse take care preacher there seems past connecting them together . preacher almost leads one think he main character " hang ' em high " because noose mark his neck he hides scarf . this certainly one eastwood better westerns good plot extensive character development . film also certain element supernatural no one knows exactly whether eastwood character living man or avenging ghost coming out past . overall excellent film worth renting or owning	1

thornton mellon ( late rodney dangerfield ) american success story . son immigrants , he worked hard used business savvy get fabulously wealthy his chain " tall fat " stores ( " a-frames " ladies " new hindenberg line " men ) . but mellon never made it college , now his son ( keith gordon ) thinking quitting school , too . mellon ditches philandering trophy wife vanessa ( adrienne barbeau ) goes ' back school ' middle-aged , clueless freshman , try help his son . there great supporting cast including but not limited young robert downey , jr. ( roommate ) , college dean martin ( ned beatty ) , diving coach ( . emmett walsh ) , snobby foil ( paxton whitehead ) . sally kellerman plays surprisingly credible love interest cameos kurt vonnegut , jr. sam kinnison round out impressive cast . good soundtrack classic academia sets help film . but , essence , back school vehicle charming ever-witty rodney dangerfield his one liners ( " shape i'm , you could donate my body science fiction " ) . don't expect anything serious or profound this film , but it gentle fun , holds up well after so many years , consistently brilliant screenplay	1
new yorker reviewer ( above ) might better suited hard news ; he obviously doesn't much understanding imaginative art . he should least remember cliche artists use lies reveal truth . he criticizes " eternal sunshine " " implausible " -- hmm , doesn't seem hurt reputation " tempest " or " midsummer night dream . " i think maybe reviewer should watch bloody thing eight more times , if that what it takes get it . i blown away ( admittedly bit confused , making me want watch it again ) first time i saw it . charlie kaufman borrowed little best sci-fi altering bit reality help him examine human condition . this isn't linear story , it meditation love , fate , regrets , choice , second chances - if you knew how it turns out , would you it again ? he may answered old question whether we choose who fall love . i may watch movie again really get under surface what happens lengthy sequence carey winslett character travel through his memories he tries hang her memory . i think carey winslett both give incredible performances , kirstin dunst . if nothing else , kaufman , gondry , cast remarkable job revealing how fragile we all - even guy who raiding clementine memories joel woo her himself comes across more sad then creepy . this , ultimately , very tender film . when i read dickens or shakespeare , i sometimes get sense author genuine affection characters he created , i get same feeling this film .	1

30 years ago i advanced belly dancing student los angeles who stopped lessons only because i felt pressure " get job " ! me belly dancing always more personal spiritual than just . although i used movements when i went greek folk dancing ( some couples dances ) , i kind lost touch solo aspect dance . remember there no dvds back then!jenna bellydance basics beyond : technique solid foundation heaven-sent me . it proved great way stretch warm-up exercises , review basic moves -- safely , comments proper posture so dancer doesn't injury herself -- also perhaps correct technical flaws .	1
advent dvds , i've made it minor hobby compare various versions shakespeare plays - especially othello , lear hamlet . i not see polanski macbeth until recently but aware it decades . my view this single most powerful film adaptation any shakespeare play . though much too intense children or even most teens , polanski artful direction captures insanity , mysticism , jealousy , hate , horror playwright most brutal work perfectly . settings gloomy but realistic acting uniformly excellent . if polanski never made film , he would still remembered vividly capturing complex intensity this play . even jaded modern audiences emotionally exhausted film end- which not easy this age ubiquitous violence sex . this no holds barred shakespeare ; definitely not faint heart .	1
event this movie based so despicable john singleton ( director ) add fictional characters so it wouldn't look shameful rosewood really . some fictitious elements ... 1 . mann ( ving rhames ) character 200% fiction . not even loosely based any historical person . so ending , when mann shooting mob train ... never happened . 2 . emotional distraught racist duke ( bruce mcgill ) son , emmit , fictional not based anything historic . added dramatic purposes obviously . 3 . sylvester ( don cheatle ) died real life during shootout not return heroically horse beside train pick mann up . far i know , rest if pretty accurate .. reality , during massacres like rosewood , heroes like mann sylvester first die . but i knew when i saw him escape lynching , cutting himself down , shooting mob when he escaping train his character based " some " fiction . but then i found out his whole character fictional . singleton create hero , or else black folks would killing people when movie over . i wouldn't blame them . i remember i could hardly sleep night i saw movie . during events like this , not one person faced any charges . not one ! jon voight , always , gave hell performance . his character , john wright , obviously racist , but not bigot . but when he witnesses lynching folks he known years his face , he change heart arranges his friends who owns train passes rosewood pick up black women children . michael rooker , sheriff walker , great job law who could not control his town . he , too , racist , but still wanted order . black preacher movie typical religious uncle tom . proving karl marx theory religion role oppressive societies correct ( drug keep oppressed people satisfied belief after-life ) . read black wallstreet too . i'd like see director make movie . anton batey	1
nutshell : seems crazy , perhaps even insane , today but . . . half century ago , everything we now see " atomic cafe " not only seemed real , but it designed provide us ( effective this ) both motivation security weather nuclear age every way -- or least what we believed ! most all , propaganda provided fear which provided us motivation maintain vigilance we thought needed honorably provide security our way life . we wrong ? : atomic cafe means different things different people ! i live through shelter drills cuban missle crisis , but what it all meant relative propaganda shorts such " duck cover " we may never fully understand . we really need atomic weapons ? anyone ? atomic weapons something added , or detracted , our security ? what rest world ? yes , passage time reveal great deal nuclear age our policies . " atomic cafe " used sort historic tour-guide this recent era effect media us through excerpts official government films times . propaganda always seems so ridiculous superfluous when it put historic context , so what makes this type propaganda different significant ? maybe question can't answered yet , but see " atomic cafe " you may part answer . video : since this video essentially pieced together old propaganda films , quality transfer less than ideal start . add , " atomic cafe " made these already old film scaps 1982 , we see this going tired-looking video terms state its preservation . i not seen dvd yet , but i think i should probably buy one before this vhs copy wears out . bottom line : should fitting requiem nuclear agethis documentary needs seen appreciated it different though valid significant meanings different people	1

`the cider house rules ' succeeds delivering touching thought provoking melodrama that only elevated prime acting part it entire cast . homer , toby maguire gives one his better performances , although i still feel he comes across bit nervous uneasy , if he not too confident his own acting ability . this though offset brilliant acting part his co-stars , like michael caine charlize theron who embody their characters come across like seasoned veterans we know they . film follows homer , young orphan who raised maine orphanage dr. wilber larch ( caine ) who takes care orphans if they his own trained homer take his place . one thing homer could never get used illegal abortions , safe they , wilber insisted performing . it through one these abortions homer meets candy ( theron ) wally ( rudd ) . he decides leave orphanage them take work apple orchard . this course troubles larch homer closest thing he ever real family . this movie touches upon so many controversial subjects , abortion ( which controversial no matter who you talk ) well incest drug abuse , but it so taste tact intelligence makes this film much more impressionable . upon closing credits viewer given lot ponder , lot digest , but that tell tale sign movie this caliber , movie message , its job . i personally think `the cider house rules ' one those movies we all well experience ourselves	1
each these movies treasures . yes they old sometimes slow . yes , sound not excellent . we all seen them one time or . still , they filled some greatest movie quotes all time . when ronald coleman says famous line " tale two cities " , " it far , far , better rest i go than i ever known " , you can't imagine anyone saying it better . when laurence oliver , speaking his pursuit " lizzy " tells greer garson " pride prejudice " " .. chapeter definitely closed " , you seeing best mr. darcy miss bennet ever filmed . yes even better than kiera knightly . but total surprise , you get see w.c. fields " david copperfield " . who would known how great actor he . i still check out if this direct quote book or something fields made up when he says ... " copperfield , i nothing bestowe but advice , still , advice so important i never taken it myself ..... " enjoy these movies .	1

this film excellent , not too long not too short , light mood would make emily bronte proud . love casting sinead o'connor eb herself beginning end ! soundtrack only element gets bit much - same series notes over over doesn't really justice visuals . even though ralph fiennes juliette binoche visibly considerably older than teenaged- early-twenties heathcliffe catherine story , they very believable . other presentations wuthering heights polished , " sexy " heathcliffe who just isn't right since heathcliffe monster through through . fiennes carries it off beautifully barely sublimated savagery showing through every scene , yet remains sympathetic somehow . binoche mischievous smirk perfect cathy who more succubus than , instance , merle oberon glamorous princess 1939 version . i don't often buy movies own repeatedly view , so my shelf favorites not large , but this movie prominent among them .	1

this movie awful , completely inaccurate they made it seem like she just some crazy person who slept her way top . nowonder people think so badly marilyn monroe . i'm sorry but you not become pop culture icon stupid . that what they made it seem like . according this movie she only made three movies high all time , always horny illiterate . movie they even said " i get top even if i sleep every man hollywood " but really you think it though , they this every great artist . so i suppose that why they it here . they it michael jackson man mirror , mozart beethoven they make it seem like they no talent accendently became pop culture figures.so, sum it all up . you would dumb marilyn monroe portrayed like this movie ... belive it	-1

i agree some reviewers here , this dvd needs upgrade . it too great funny not time investment make this dvd worthy film . however , until new dvd comes , i settle what i . this film discussed length , i would just like add if you never seen this film , yourself favor buy it . not rent it . buy it . it good . tim burton made classic ghost story [ he made many great films ] but this film where i first became really interested his work . film stars young ( geena davis ) ( alec baldwin ) husband wife who recently died . they don't know they dead first , but come realize they never survived their accident . however , they new people home they once occupied : they don't like it . ( jeffrey jones ) funny this film , his character his wife ( catherine o'hara ) delightfully funny . dark broody daughter portrayed ( winona ryder ) who befreinds two recently departed ghost . however , main character ' beetlejuice , ' who portrayed very funny ( michael keaton ) . he helps rid ghosts pesky intruders : but cost . film funny well worth purchase . highly recommended . [ stars : 5+	1
ok , i saw this movie years ago when it first came out i rented it vhs dvd few times , still don't own it yet . this good friday 13th movie , but best thing this movie way they brought jason back file . you tommy jarvis now around 18-19 years old losing his hair , he escapes mental institution his side kick ( arnold horshack ? ) anyway , he goes cemetary rainy night dig up jason face his past once all . but after opening coffin seeing jason dead body he goes crazy ( obviously not taking his meds ) pulls metal pole cemetary fence starts stabbing jason while dead man still coffin . after calming down he throws jason mask down grave gives jason few choice words . all sudden lightening strikes pole while it stuck jason body . rest they say history . jason comes back life goes work . these movies so subjective , i loved it one best , last " real " friday 13th movie . but i would rent it see what you think before you buy it . i own parts 2-5 all good films , part ii probably best . i need part one , part six then my collection complete , nothing after part six important . part 8 funny watch , but not worth buying , but ending really good though	1

adventures superman began production its last two seasons ( aired during 1957-58 ) , series more or less overcome its tight budgetary restrictions evolving into veritable universe unto itself . it wacky universe indeed , operating under its own screwy story logic often totally disconnected any semblance reality . gangsters would watch their bullets bounce off superman chest then , emptied their cartridges , throw their empty guns superhero , if would stop him , or superman pals never seemed realize man kypton mild-mannered reporter clark kent one same , mattered not one iota its legion young viewers . fans comic books , big-budget movies tv shows recent decades , adventures superman rightly appears quaint times depressingly cheap , but if you stick it , chances you'll find it peculiar but very real charm all its own . this year hollywoodland , superman actor george reeves ' last years struggling actor private eye investigation following reeves ' death ( barely year after last show aired ) , adopts curiously contemptuous attitude toward show especially its fan base . though young children took its wild stories face value , many adults very charm show its good-natured goofiness . adventures superman one most iconically ' 50s/eisenhowerian programs its era . superman , after all , fighting not only truth justice , but also " american way . " instead super-villains like lex luthor , superman foes more likely communist types , ironically enough union activist robert shayne , actor who played superman ally inspector henderson metropolis police , during its run subpoenaed appear before house un-american activities committee nearly lost his role it not members cast crew who rushed shayne defense . wonderful example this very ' 50s tone " atomic captive , " cold war masterpiece . after russian fifth columnists fail bring back russian-immigrant nuclear scientist ( loyal naturalized american citizen ) , daily planet reporters jimmy olson ( jack larson ) lois lane ( noel neill ) drive out desert interview him . however , scientist dying radiation poisoning , so " hot " his mere touch likewise fatal . jimmy lois rush , naturally ignore his pleas not go near him , each pawing man reckless abandon . when scientist tells them they've just given themselves fatal dose radiation , all jimmy turn lois say , " golly miss lane , i guess we're . " making matters worse , they then drive out into desert , taking short cut through " ground zero " nuclear test site , wrongly figuring they wouldn't possibly reschedule h-bomb test they flown out cover first place . well , they wrong , take full force nuclear blast , just like glenn manning amazing colossal man . how superman save day ? you'll tune yourself . this complete lack common sense part lois jimmy used throughout these later seasons , apparently kind shorthand propel narrative forward without need lengthy ( logical ) character motivation . " perils superman , " imposing man lead mask ( michael fox ) shows up daily planet grimly announce he devised fiendishly imaginative means " liquidate " lois , jimmy , clark , planet editor perry white ( john hamilton ) . within minute or two after he leaves , lois perry blithely off meeting , business usual . it no surprise then they're kidnapped minute they get into lois ' car . then again , if nothing happened them , there'd no show . budget precluded superman actually performing feats grand " changing course mighty rivers , " but production values these later shows better than those when show began . seasoned b-movie directors like lew landers howard bretherton helmed episodes , star george reeves , while instantly recognizable character actors like jack kruschen , john banner , cyril delevanti , laurie mitchell , billy curtis ( martian mr. zero ) , dabbs greer , joi lansing populate episodes . serial fans likewise delight such familiar faces dale van sickel , tristram coffin , i . stanford jolley , usually playing villains . video audio adventures superman : complete fifth sixth seasons full color presented its original full frame format episodes varying quality . opening titles all shows tend look awful , but episodes themselves generally very sharp bright , super-saturated hues reminiscent early two-color technicolor . series used same shots superman leaping out windows flight over-and-over these modest effects probably never color-timed new footage , hence they tend stick out like sore thumbs . mono audio okay , optional subtitles french spanish . extra features only extra superman pal : jimmy olson , brief tribute jack larson charming performances throughout run series . he interviewed once again , noel neill superman historians jim beaver , gary grossman , michael . hayde , jan henderson . there no mention reeves ' untimely death anywhere discs , or anything various aborted attempts revive series some form years followed . parting thoughts though adventures superman scripts leave all logic door , stories these last 26 episodes pleasingly close spirit light-hearted tone era comic books . neill hair becomes almost phosphorescently orange both reeves larson fleshier features , reeves ' hair little grayer thinner , larson no longer 19-year-old youth he when show began , but youthful excitement still greets show remains unabated .	1

when blue lagoon came out theatres , i 17 , my parents refused allow me see it . it wasn't until i 29 , married cable i finally watched this contraversial film . while i still think it more appropriate actors 18 years old , rather than 14 , due mature themes nudity , this not your hot sweaty sex movie . you get buffy vampire slayer just any daytime/primetime tv , these days . what story 2 cousins , eventually left their own , trying survive eden-like paradise , innocence children natural curiosities adolescence brings . they love , gently affectionately , they child , they content . when ship nears , they make mutual decision remain island not try rescued . word , they complete . while acting overall pretty pathetic , script trite many places , there some poignant moments ; em " meeting " god laying flowers his feet so they would not make him mad would go heaven . richard contemplating bleached skeleton paddy realizing his own eventual fate , well em his son . mutual decisions not saved , well saying farewell each other after eating poison berries , when accidently drifting out sea . one cannot but heartbroken when they found asleep , rather than dead , because there no place society them . they belong paradise , director should let them die . even music becomes sad rather than jubilant . scenery gorgeous , beautiful score , acting fairly bad . so , why we keep returning blue lagoon ? because wouldn't we all like marooned gorgeous tropical island our perfect love left live simple fulfilling lives paradise ? 5 stars idea , 2-3 acting , so gave it 4 .	1
bible salesman never cooler , this shows side bible salesman never shown again , it could because they no longer same , or it could if anyone tried re-capture what already , it would called just film , this not just film , this film more power humor than any real story ever capture , see this film , see this film . i love it	1
i seen chinese odyssey many times , because it just so funny ! chinese odyssey not really remake chinese classic , journey west , but it more parody , or side story based monkey king . chinese odyssey period drama set ancient china . here , monkey king , sun wu kong ( stephen chow ) reborn ( although he doesn't know this yet because he yet find particular person who " confirm his identity " ) , he now leader bandit group . two demons ( spider " white-bones " demon ) suddenly appear one day forcefully " force " bandits their bidding . there , story moves include time-travel , romance , friendship self-discovery . there plenty twists turns really different original story , which good since it doesn't get boring even if you already know story monkey king . however , minus you'll need know story monkey king able appreciate laugh some jokes aimed original story , but if you don't , there still plenty comical parts around keep you laughing . funny parts may rather silly times , but go ahead laugh their silliness . afterall , stephen chow known king comedy . :) end part 1 , you'd probably feel like ending too abrupt somewhat cliffhanger , but chinese odyssey comes two parts , so you'll need watch part 2 well able fully understand entire movie . if you into chinese mythology culture , give this try take time enjoy this show !	1

i not realize how old sound-track this made-for-television animation until carl reiner , interviewer , set scene , saying , " plane landed idlewild . " sound track probably taken record released 1961 . president jfk still alive ; his family no compelling need name things after him . so , airport still idlewild , not kennedy . according sources who asked remain nameless , since naming them would give away their real ages , mel brooks , 2000 year old man himself , carl reiner performed this little interview throughout 1950s , but never recorded it . i seem remember reading somewhere , perhaps new yorker magazine , first recording took place reiner home , sometime late 1950s . after dinner , reiner turned tape recorder , walked microphone over brooks - dear friend guest - set scene . then he asked first question ... i impression challenge new one brooks , but if my sources correct , they predict there would no weapons mass destruction , brooks reiner through routine many times before fateful night . now , i ask , tape transcribed onto record , or duo it again vinyl ? i don't know , but i suspect they recorded it few times . reason details . review appeared new york times 1975 , when animation this video first broadcast cbs television network , there quote : " i 25,000 children ... not one them ever writes ! " video quote " i 42,000 children ... even one them ever come over visit ? " so , perhaps time media home entertainment picked up animation marketed version i , 1984 , some things changed . who knows ? both versions joke funny , unless you sitting home , dark , waiting your kids call or come over , which case neither version funny . but seriously , " tragedy when i cut my finger . comedy when you don't look where you going , fall hole , die .

literally . flatland edwin abbott abbott little gem book which could not pigeon-holed into specific genre over hundred fifty years ago result ended up science fiction shelves . combining geometry philosophy ( even religion ) , it allegory human condition , describing very rigidly-structured society where square pegs aspired fit through round holes . plot focuses . square , who led series epiphanies nature reality itself realization not only there existence beyond his two-dimensional plane form 3-dimensional universe , but further dimensions implied . he learns appearances not necessarily all they seem . difficult conceptualize its reading , llad ehlinger , jr. managed graphically express this evolution mind . despite these worlds populated exclusively geometric shapes , we drawn into story feel . square transformation though it our own , which it hopes . flatland itself appropiately extremely two-dimensional , yet endearing qualities . our hero perspective , he first confused , then exhilarated he lifted into three-dimensional world . we taken dizzying ride . this only beginning . square , who then postulates other worlds both less more dimensions . ehlinger sequence which only homage 2001 : space odyssey multi-dimensionality explored . if this not big enough task tackle , ehlinger expands storyline applying some original concepts governments their logical path war . flatland , both book movie , appreciated many levels . adding extra layer , ehlinger actually simplified book . i enjoyed this movie . it mind-bending thought-provoking , graphic element integral its message . potentially too-heavy treatise lightened very humorous details , such warbled battle cries female lines flatland , who need both sway make noise all times order seen when not approached their sides , so not pierce unobservant polygons ! there more than meets eye this unusual independently filmed marketed movie . one viewing may not enough	1

this classic western one sam peckinpah greatest . i found dialouge chemistry james coburns pat garrett kris kristoffersons billy kid mesmerizing . kristofferson very young this part fairly inexperienced actor but it doesn't show one bit . costumes period portrayed perfectly . characters dirty , crash , wild . there many colorful characters portrayed lot famous character actors you probably seen ton movies . slim pickens also here brief but memorable role . kid garretts friendship what holds movie together even though they don't show their early outlaw years together they don't . you feel two long relationship their friendship runs very deep . check this movie out if you want see great western just plain great piece movie making	1
i waiting movie like this years years , finally something made not complete hackwork containing nothing but nudity barely mentioning name hpl , even though posing " lovecraft-film " . i watched movie fellow lovecraftian , we greatly pleased adaptation . i never quite understood why teeming masses chose this particular tale hpl their object obsession , since there great number fantastic tales hpl vastly more memorable than call cthulhu , but i'll grant it indeed fine tale , even including journey norway it pages ! there not so much say movie , it ( once ) very true tale , so perfectionist i am , i didn't find much complain there . i loved opening scene wreck man telling tale understanding listener , his face unforgettable ! i only two small criticisms make , one fight-scene swamps , i found this quite silly , something nearly wrecked movie me my friend . other end , where great cthulhu reveals himself . i acknowledge they limited budget , but i just didn't quite enjoy him much i would liked . said , scene where man falls into wall while fleeing his divine attacker something i'll never forget . absolutely splendid ! whole island just perfectly , i adored it . bonus-material interesting , but i hope there few normal people out there who enjoy hpl too , not only bunch strange freaks , like many people behind movie undeniably . said , i really enjoyed film , apart minor criticisms i've already mentioned , i highly recommend this excellent adaptation set style 1920 movie	1
this film treated something like lost child canon director woody allen career . if he would apologize this instead , say , " curse jade scorpion " . what allen attempted here his directorial debut groundbreaking . this first example i recall director telling his film mock-documentary style , later employed albert brooks perfected christopher guest . allen proves himself not only great comic visualist but there great verbal puns here well . conceit film gas . we're supposed believe allen virgil starkwell , inept dweeb criminal , if not among fbi most wanted cause mr. hoover some sleepless nights . gags here rapidfire but i wouldn't spoil it those who uninitiated . my favorite , though , virgil orchestrating prison break gun he fashioned out soap during rainstorm . all this failed effort leaves him hand full soap lather . also , noteworthy cast late janet margolin virgil faithful wife . margolin basically plays straight woman allen but it shame this gifted actress who so good " david lisa " didn't more substantial film career	1
this movie story monty kessler ( brendan fraser ) , senior harvard who thinks his thesis his life . his computer fries ( surprise , surprise ) monty , perfectionist he decides go make copies it second his computer dies school copy center . only problem he slips falls while en route loses thesis boiler room one harvard libraries . he one his roommates then sneak into library ; only monty can't get his thesis back because old homless man decided use it firewood , only give it back him page page-a good deed per page , . initially monty decides use old man , whose name turns out simon wilder ( joe pesci ) not old he looks-to get his thesis back . but monty takes liking guy , all but one his roommates , two become very close . monty winds up learning lot simon ; result movie predictable many ways not predictable other ways . basic formula before , but this movie still good one , not awful but not best movie out there . it one those movies you watch over over again not tire . my book it gets four star rating . again , not best , there better movies out there , especially likes brendan fraser joe pesci , but worth your while . dvd this movie contains absolutely no extras i able find , not even music video main song " i'll remember " madonna .	1

otto preminger follow-up his ground-breaking film noir " laura " off-beat , dark foreboding tale con man eric stanton ( dana andrews ) who arrives small california coastal town literally no money his pockets . he soon under spell sultry waitress stella ( linda darnell ) . they no dough marry , however , so stanton plans get hitched wealthy heiress , june mills ( alice faye ) , then get rid her take her fortune . stella , however , not exactly sitting idly - she many boyfriends dates infuriate her lover . ultimately , things don't go planned ; stella found murdered eric prime suspect . surprisingly , june stands him tries him cleared . david raksin again provides haunting theme , dick haymes providing vocals stella favorite song , " slowly " plays repeatedly diner where she works . relationship andrews darnell very daringly portrayed 40s - what preminger able get away amazing - i'm surprised censors weren't all over him ! faye andrews actually end up sharing same bed motel room ( although their characters married this point ) but considering production code , it amazing scene not cut out censors . charles bickford provides right amount suspicion , cynicism ulterior motives local police detective who knows much more than he admit . darnell role stella turning point her career - she went portraying virginal heroines tarts femme fatales . her chemistry andrews explosive ; it could almost considered entanglement calls restraining order . faye blondness darnell dark brunette coloring give distinction heroine temptress . this film most remembered fact this last film alice faye would make over 20 years - she so angered because much her screen time reduced favor darnell ( although she placed blame studio , not linda ) , she left lot huff threw her keys guard . dvd transfer great ; it looks especially good since film out circulation so long . interesting extras , including photo galleries , theatrical trailer , commentary noir expert eddie muller dana andrew youngest daughter , susan , who gives some wonderful insights into this under-appreciated actor . not classic " laura " but definitely good example what dark film noir all	1
rebel without cause first movie james dean i've ever seen . i plan watch his other two because this one so good i didn't want it end . james dean one most beautiful actors i've ever seen . it wasn't just way he looked , ( though helps course ) but he also this charismatic way him makes you want watch his every move . i think that why , i watching movie , i started noticing he reminded me very much character ryan atwood oc . i first noticed way james dean looked people . he same manner ryan oc . james dean moves his eyes right or left sometimes instead straight ahead . his eyebrows raise slightly his smile never more than grin . it very endearing quality it why i noticed it so quickly into movie . then i noticed way james dean smoked . james dean made smoking cigarettes look like art form instead something could cause cancer . lol first episode oc , ryan took out cigarette he talking marissa he looked exactly like james dean . time though , i just thought ryan very " cool " " sexy " since i'd never seen rebel without cause . i no idea two looked so very much alike their mannerisms . there other similarities movie oc , such mansion trio run movie , model home oc where teens there go hide ryan . i'm not sure if this look character ryan atwood purpose make him seem like ' james dean ' type or if storyline just coincidence but my point saying all this i think kids today relate this movie . even though rebel without cause made over 50 years ago , teens today deal parental issues , peer pressure , rejection feelings first love . i would recommend this movie anyone ... especially teenagers .... who get tired same type movie they see over over . rebel without cause true classic i hope anyone hasn't seen it , gives it chance watches it just see themselves not all movies old , ' old fashion ' boring . this one great it one i could , watch many times . i'd really like add oc fans should watch it just see what i'm talking . i'd like see if anyone else noticed what i .	1

i know plenty people completely shocked i find billy madison adam sandler best movie date ( most argue me it happy gilmore but i could not disagree more ) . billy madison perfectly silly movie requires no thought need not overanalyzed . it adam sandler movie crying outloud , not ground-breaking documentary , so get over it . if you enjoy adam sandler somehow missed billy madison , you need go get it right now . billy madison ( adam sandler ) coasted through life his father dime . his father preparing retire wants leave his hotel empire his only son , but billy just wants drink sun all day live good life ( can't say i blame him ) . however , due billy lack responsibility drunken penguin-chasing ways , his father can't good conscious turn company over billy . plus , his dad admits he paid off all billy teachers first grade let him pass . his dad wants turn company over man named eric who worked him years , but eric evil guy . billy doesn't want eric gain control his father hotels so he throws log fire - he comes up idea return school take each grade over again order take over company . course , this where movie takes new silliness . i'm not saying this oscar-winner or anything like , but if you've bad day office or just need something mindless amusing zone out , billy madison movie you . adam sandler some great movies out there , but billy madison still remained my favorite one , even after all this time . absolutely recommended	1

you pretty much know any film featuring both john candy dan aykroyd going generate some laughs , making great outdoors pretty safe bet anyone mood little comedy - comedy basically all you should expect here ( any film supplies subtitles raccoon conversations isn't really trying express anything meaningful ) , despite fact john hughes wrote script . once , hughes ' involvement more harm than good . while great outdoors certainly good movie , it not very good john hughes movie . course , it hard follow 80s classics like breakfast club pretty pink , but hughes ' heart just didn't seem this one . this best demonstrated teenaged romance part story , which stumbles start really goes nowhere all . when you come right down it , there just isn't any real depth any characters this film - that just not something you expect get john hughes . all chet ripley ( john candy ) wanted nice family vacation country , week relax his wife bond his two boys , especially older one ( frankly , i'm not really sure why younger son even movie ) . what he got " surprise " form his brother-in-law roman craig ( dan aykroyd ) his rather strange family ( annette bening playing mrs. craig ) turning up out blue vacation right him . you can't just tell family get out , though , even if family includes arrogant , rich , know-it-all like roman . chet his best grin bear it , but you know it just matter time before he loses it . when inevitable happen , it triggers series important events re-draw some main characters , even giving roman heretofore unsuspected ( albeit rather narrow ) depth . despite this , strangely insignificant summer romance buck ( chris young ) local girl ( lucy deakins ) , great outdoors really just plays laughs nothing else . some more memorable scenes include chet wild water ski ride , course , battle pitting chet roman against bat . you'll definitely laugh several different moments , but film never really elevates itself side-splitting plateau comic genius . many ways , this pretty safe comedy - it doesn't break any new ground , but it really comfortable fit . would okay many filmmaker , but great outdoors just doesn't live up john hughes ' usually higher standards	1

um ... maybe because our attraction visuals ! first off , ignore all reviewers who complain this story line isn't most imaginative ever thought up , therefore give this fantastic movie terrible review . main point this movie it visually fun watch ! movie starts zevo toy founder kenneth giving dying wish his military brother leland : brother take over toy factory when kenneth passes away . kenneth son leslie ( robin williams ) true love company , but lacks leadership skills really take over company ... until leland starts making toys into actual weapons use kids all killing . this forces leslie come grips some serious issues what really important him , makes him couragous leader ( captain patrick zevo , leland son ) toy army take leland insanity . i'm not big fan or rap any means , but i really got kick out ll cool j performance this movie , it fun watch his character develop into toy-factory loving guy . robin williams brilliant usual , rest cast enjoyable well . most important scene this movie definitly fake vomit testing room turns into potentially deadly crossword puzzle - but there many other visual treats well ... enjoy !	1
i first saw this movie child , age 8 , ever since i loved this movie , most important fact it darker , more interesting , adaptation oz story . dark side this movie may scare children , it myself , but it not overwhelming or too extreme . fact , this movie strikes fine perfect balance darker elements , so typical child , over age 6 or so , scared good way . this because darker sides this film represented things children really should watch out real life , such stranger adults , temptations wander far off home . characters unique original , set designs visual treat . this movie must see people who want more substance than overrated sappy ' wizard oz ' movie pathetically timid judy garland . this movie , fairuza balk plays much stronger compelling dorothy , who we respect believe . overall , this movie far better than any other oz movie terms its dedication original books .	1

first all - even though most my friends hate them - i must admit i enjoy watching some good horror flicks . my dvd collection also primarily concentrating this genre . besides classics , such " psycho " , " haunting ( original ) " , " rosemary baby " , " exorcist " , " omen ( original ) " , " shining " , " changeling " , " halloween " , " alien " " evil dead " . i also enjoy more recent flicks , such " 6th sense " , " others " , " ring ( us version ) " , " grudge ( us version ) " " descent " , " dawn dead ( remake ) " " tcm 2003 remake " . problem " beginning " , . viewer knows nobody survive this massacre second movie starts . which leads fact no hero found this movie ! . nobody gets know why leatherface turned out this way . damn , they could've atleast shown some flashbacks or decent intro e.g.in " house wax " . . there waaaay too much unnecessary gore therefore lack true suspense . these facts , especially last , make this movie over top gorefest same league " wolf creek " , " high tension " , " hostel " " saw ( sequels ) " . one re-viewer stated . horror movies should entertain giving viewer bonechilling suspense few good scares . this movie sadly couldn't succeed , due unnecessary gore , splatter blood . i don't need	1

this reminder man inhumanity suffering caused wwii . when one lost all family personal possessions , desperation move one take liberties truth survival sake . but what one when such deception trumped people living one own house telegraph hill ? torturous concentration camp background , it plausible others may easily convinced immigrant cracking up . when help needed , who trusted while personally living lie new country ? viewer sees events through eyes immigrant victoria kowelska ( valentina cortese ) . following bit early over-dramatization concentration camp , victoria assumes identity wealthy benefactor named karen . after her marriage alan ( richard basehart ) , karen/victoria attempts prove murderous cover-up taking place her own life danger . same time , others either trying make her believe everything normal or she delusional . mrs. danvers ' contempt rebecca , " murderous " attempts suspicion , effort convince paula she going insane gaslight find corresponding scenes house telegraph hill . events unfold , subtle twists may catch you off guard but history prior classics may render some conclusions obvious . nevertheless , presentation not borrow such extent make it rehash . it more like tribute favored classics sufficient new settings good degree suspense . i some minor criticisms . few unresolved scenes , like reaction obvious scrapbook tampering why evidence explosion remains years , left viewer imagination logic . deathbed confessions closing scenes attempt sew up most loose ends . major marc bennett ( william lundigan ) seems too friendly too quickly appears nonchalant every twisted development . film transfer very good but not great .

going i assumed this film suave player ( campbell scott ) who charm women end up passing this skill down his nephew . i only half right . during set up we actually find out he sort prick . if he likes you he uses his elocutionary skills flatter you . if he bad day he using them debase you . then his 16 yr . old nephew enters picture asks help ladies . normally he might not " waste " his time helping human , but i believe it creates nice distraction current turbulation his life . this film primarily takes place during one night . scott bss his way throughout evening trying teach his nephew thing or 2 . they interact couple chicks bar , elizabeth berkley who i enjoy jennifer beals who i find highly overrated . they like boy naivetivity . scott then continues night trying get boy laid while night gets seamier seamier . there definitely some truthfullness this movie , such when scott tells his nephew closing time scenario which everyone gets depressed just don't want alone . end it seems nephew may learned thing or 2 even though he'd probably retain his sweetness . scott may or may not change , but i think it more scene lonliness than any one or 2 characters . this film really seem push you into movie . i often felt uncomfortable , just like real life . this look filmmakers going it really worked me .	1

seen theatrical release " fanny alexander " several times through years , it taken me while set aside time watch miniseries whence it came . film , course , won four oscars including 1984 best foreign film -- widely regarded ingmar bergman most personal masterpiece . i've always appreciated film , but never really put it among my favorites -- but experienced it anew 5+ hour miniseries version , might just changed . i'm not going delve into plot particularly , but more my response viewing experience . opening takes place during grand family celebration . extended version , this full ninety minutes . within this time , we meet immediate family , extended family , servants , friends -- literally dozens people . you get sense relationships , real feeling dynamic within household -- true appreciation theatrical roots ekdahl clan . fanny alexander play minor roles all merriment -- no one given more screen time than anyone else . while this all very nice , you might not see real emotional impact this opening until end film . fact , light tone beginning doesn't prepare you what follow . subsequent episodes , fanny alexander lose their father . then year later , their mother remarries religious leader forsaking her past material belongings . it these strict , unforgiving settings real drama starts unfold . while i taken break after first episode , i continued watch rest " fanny alexander " one sitting . it absolutely enthralling drama . nuanced performances , battle wills plays out next three hours like great theater . it intense , thrilling , powerful , haunting , even times ethereal -- pitch perfect screenplay words chosen carefully maximum impact . much acclaim given cinematography direction " fanny alexander , " that all excellent -- but words perfection . there plenty terrific performances contribute impact film . i especially captivated ewa froling emilie , fanny alexander mother . jan malmsjo , showiest role new stepfather , alternately evil strangely sympathetic . scenes these two resonate me long time . so consider me convert -- i am now raving " fanny alexander . " while opening may seem bit long uneventful , i promise you'll see sweetness impact it brings ending . so watch longer version , stick it you'll greatly rewarded . kgharris , 11/06	1
i really enjoyed this show , although like other reviewers i seen here , i wished she little more older material . still , you understand she catch up her last three albums , since there no tour right after bedtime stories or ray light . most show material ray light music , which two really good albums . she opens " drowned world ( substitute love ) " , then dives right into " impressive instant " , one best 2000 music . there few songs i wouldn't included personally . i think she should replaced stuff like " candy perfume girl " , which i don't think terrible song , i just wasn't feeling it show . it kind fit into creepy skin head-punk theme she going though . also , " beautiful stranger " isn't bad song either , but it didn't much me live . we also could without " mer girl " live song . it nice pretty , but kind makes energy fun come screeching halt . images bruised bloodied madonna weren't very flattering either . still , i could understand way show worked ; almost if it all juxtoposition beauty ugliness . i liked it because it departure her usual live fare , but some costumes hair just hideous ! i hated kill bill/ninja outfit " sky fits heaven " , but i enjoy jumps kicks . i like " frozen " costume-that amazing should remained stage longer than it . i liked they included one remixes song well mix it up bit . i love " nobody perect " studio song , but not live . then , i bit over whole madonna-as geisha thing . " nothing really matters " might made better song somewhere however . western set included such songs " don't tell me " " gone " really good " human nature " much welcome return older material . loved mechanical bull ! it all very cute well . " funny song " not very necessary , though it meant novelty , stupid those who wanted maybe older song it place . also , i think dixie chicks already made song killing cooking no good man . " secret " one my favorites ! i absolutely love this song played live . last couple sets best my opinion . i loved " what it feels like girl " espanol ( could without remix accompanying disturbing anime screens ) . course , " la isla bonita " brilliant , usual closers " holiday " " music " right point . overall , it dvd worth buying . madonna genius putting all this together so many different themes ideas . while i disagree few apects it , mainly song choices , it wasn't my show . it madonna show i'll get over it . i like some other tours little better though . but it all good	1
i'm kids hall fan , but * my * kids can't watch those shows just yet . i read reviews sctv decided it worth buying . we enjoyed all shows volume 1 , we don't get tired rewatching them . andrea martin evita spoof , rick moranis easy-listening remakes " turning japanese " police " da doo doo doo , da da da da " hilarious . john candy yuri , soviet weightlifter who gets his own talk show ! humor still completely target . it not frenetic pace most shows today , so some people might not like .	1
first let me say if you like shows like office ( both uk usa ) or larry sanders show or curb your enthusiasm , you love this show . like those shows its shot documentary style makes it feel if you these characters lives . i first saw episode newsroom pbs . i immediately struck genius ken finkleman ( shows main star , writer director ) . where office shows you satirical view office life newsroom shows you equal satirical view toronto newsroom life . how " leads " news cast chosen ( i.e. higher body count ) mundane issues george news director gets hung up ( getting parking space buildings garage ) you find yourself laughing others misfortune . all genius this show i very disappointed three episode long finale . i guess it trying make statement narcissistic ways george but it just wasn't funny ( thus 4 instead 5 stars ) . said , last episode ( where characters transported political situation ) again genius . this dvd well worth your money	1
i'm sorry , i plead addiction , but i loved this series its first episode . i still remain true it . writing excellent , characters believable you really connect them . but best part mystery whole thing . all questions bubble surface your mind when you're watching show . it keeps you edge your seat , hungering more . it show really makes you think , i love . some people didn't like this particular season much first two because they didn't understand show still climbling toward climax . things aren't picture perfect , but they interesting . my only complaint it too short , here list episodes .... 1 . new world , part 12 . new world , part 23 . tom baldwin4 . gone , part 15 . gone , part 26 . graduation day7 . home front8 . blink9 . ballad kevin tess10 . starzl mutation11 . gospel according collier12 . terrible swift sword13 . fifty-fift	1

this one weirdest video adapatations novel i've ever seen . novel early work jane austen ( published posthumously ) so it not well crafted later works . despite novel weaknesses , however , even this video production not it justice . heroine looks like she heroin , maj . tinley ( played same guy who played older doctor " all creatures great small " ) positively creepy , his son , henry tilney , smirks instead smiles , thorpe sister just plain ugly ( i should say she just plain plain ) tilney sister stiff . i can't remember whether other videos this novel available this one i chose or whether there no other choice . only value video me it helped establish who characters their relationships -- before i read book . they say , " book better , " this case , old saying couldn't more true	-1

+++++ " intolerance jews fact 16th century life , even venice , most powerful liberal city state europe . law jews forced live old walled foundry or `geto ' area city . after sundown gate [ geto ] locked guarded christians . daytime any man leaving [ geto ] wear red hat mark him jew . jews forbidden own property . so they practiced usury , lending money [ ] interest . this against christian law . sophisticated venetians would turn blind eye it but religious fanatics , who hated jews , it matter ... " this how this wonderful movie begins above words printed on-screen so orient viewer . this movie based controversial troubling play " merchant venice " ( written circa 1596 ) william shakespeare ( 1564 1616 ) . main plot this play movie concentrates follows : sixteenth century venice , when christian merchant named antonio ( jeremy irons ) must default large loan jewish moneylender named shylock ( al pacino ) his friend bassanio ( joseph fiennes ) who romantic ambitions rich portia ( lynn collins ) belmont , vengeful shylock demands cruel substitute repayment antonio . movie proceeds we hear these famous words uttered shylock : " he [ antonio ] hath disgraced me ... laughed my losses , mocked my gains , scorned my nation , thwarted my bargains , cooled my friends , heated mine enemies , what his reasons ? i am jew . hath not jew eyes ? hath not jew hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ?... if you prick us , we not bleed ? if you tickle us , we not laugh ? if you poison us , we not die ? " shylock continues : " if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?... if jew wrong christian , what his humility ? revenge . if christian wrong jew , what should his sufferance christian example ? why , revenge ! " aware end movie , you may not know whether you've seen tragedy or comedy ( play officially classified comedy ) , love story or tale hate . its infinite ambiguity , movie play said quintessential shakespeare . also , aware movie entirely elizabethan language . if you not used this kind spoken language , i would strongly recommend you turn closed-captioning . ( dvd , unfortunately , not english subtitles . ) one final caution : there bare-breasted prostitutes appear briefly . they not put movie make it more risqu� but rather add some historical authenticity . venetian law time required all prostitutes bare their breasts because christian authorities concerned rampant homosexuality city . thus , this movie `r ' rating because this ( which i think ludicrous ) . acting this movie word -- fantastic . i surprised this but al pacino thoroughly convincing shylock , very complex role . i also give credit jeremy irons ralph fiennes who fine jobs their roles antonio bassanio respectively . cinematography excellent . movie filmed location venice , veneto ( region north italy ) , luxembourg . background music exquisite . i heard lute , harp , other instruments i'm not familiar . i learned later some music contributed baroque string quartet . ( baroque period art period circa 1600 1750 . ) background vocals mesmerizing . finally , dvd ( one released 2005 ) perfect picture sound quality . it few extras . bottom line : this movie worthy addition bard cinematic cannon . ( 2004 ; 2 hr , 10 min ; wide screen ; 28 scenes ; rated `r ' ) +++++	1

this spiderman blew me away . there no flaws it all . it just perfect . it much better than one made 90 ( although one great , would love see it dvd sometime but it won't happen because marvel too greedy ) it unique animation . it 3d but it still looks feels like cartoon . each episode extremely well written directed . all animated shots spiderman superb . he actually moves like spider , much more so than other animated versions this series . all action sequences more exciting than any other spiderman movie or series ever made . i don't know why marvel would only make one season best work they've ever leave us such cliffhanger season finale . diehard fans , that pretty nasty thing . they probably won't make season 2 . good thing it released dvd , least we appreciate greatness marvel once before they decided trash everything good thing they made	1

other reviewers said , leonard maltin absolutely wrong this film . comedy very tight well timed . dialogue wittiest any movie i've seen era . it tend little toward one-liners , but it doesn't matter because it fall-out-of-your-seat funny . ingrid bergman divine role you would never expected her . signs times ubiquitous -- references quot ; pill , quot ; quot ; hippies , quot ; quot ; squares , quot ; etc ., but comedy far dated . best aspect film its unconventional plot . romantic comedies highly predictable class -- this one keeps you guessing . puts even neil simon shame . highest recommendation	1
oh my , this movie god-awful . it feel throughout group first time actors playing medieval dress-up dragons camera . special effects consist computer-generated dragons extreme overuse people backs getting set fire ... that pretty much it . plot also very weak so typical . fighting scenes horribly choreographed acting so bad it looks like first time efforts every actor except two kings theldag . picture ben stiller slight beard , medieval clothes , wig . that hero this calamity movie . there also typical trite very poor attempt humor spattered throughout also . this definitely low budget title . it also 4:3 full screen only . i consider this movie purchase one worst i ever made , but it cheap . you get what you pay	-1
first season six feet under featured astonishing acting/writing/directing , truly amazing new show . however , show began lag part way into second season . it lost its witty death related humor , began lose format original shows . decline second season culminated clich� cliff hanger , typical shows don't know how maintain interest . season three starts confusing premier which includes massive jump time ejects viewer out show , further illustrates writers ' budding ability not deal tough issues . season four show fully declined into rather lame incongruent night time soap , standard love triangles , mystery deaths , psychics . they also managed fully lose their format , beginning death dictating tone show . one episodes starts death based anti-lsd agenda , after first scene they completely ignore issues kid who died . i'm pretty sure fisher sons diaz didn't even embalm guy . some point massive amount useless sex they added show , extended kidnapping episodes become nothing more than unpredictable uninteresting . if you enjoy first season six feet under , quit while you ahead . however , if you enjoy shows like alias , lost , days our lives , their cliff hangers , disjointed action , love octagons , then i would advise you party !, enjoy last few seasons . bottom line : if you looking good tv , kind where pain , humor , love dance similar fashion life , watch first season don't waist time rest . if you just love characters no matter how strange they written , continue all means ; plot doesn't get worse , just writing acting directing . porn factor : season four people just random sex , story lines seem little better then bottom barrel porn . so , i guess , good soft core porn win	1
one could review kingdom heaven lot levels ... action packed medieval adventure/romance ... vehicle some your favorite actors ... or statement humanity less than perfect attempts find spiritual meaning life way doesn't lead warfare people differing points view . i expecting mostly first two ... pleasantly surprised find reasonable amount third . my favorite quote movie summed up powerful feeling i've spirituality some time now : " god understand , my lord . if he doesn't , then he not god we need not worry . " why people so infrequently ask themselves whether god they believe really makes sense their hearts or not , i don't know . when i heard these words coming screen , i realized " someone out there understands ... we don't find god books or doctrine or sermons ... we know god our hearts , or not all " . this character looked his heart knew ... god understand ... anyone who doesn't surely not god , no matter what someone else might claim . if you loved movie , you'll enjoy this dvd ... it classy widescreen handling film that visually rich deserves seen it cinematic format . gorgeous scenery delightful characters costuming , i can't imagine watching such visually appealing film less than wide screen form .	1

i remember watching these shows young boy telly during summers ' 89 ' 90 when i off school staying barnbury park nearby islington . all shows i vividly recall loving this 1st season red dwarf . more so than later seasons . it minimalist cast , low budget simple plot idea 1st season shows not only got me into sci-fi futher but shaped my overall sense humor sarcasm . nothing i've seen america comes close red dwarf . positives : one most original starts any show i think . all episodes season 1 , whiles not funny later seasons tightly produced every aspect plot well thought out dialogues very clever brillantly acted out . if anything , red dwarf during early seasons remined me alot black adder episodes shot mainly one or two rooms whole time consisted mainly very clever funny " stage-like " dialogue 2 characters trying deal each other their problematic environment . no negatives me but : these not average commercial , mainstream fast food tv shows easily eaten quickly forgotten . there lot intellegent charm , wit well constructed science fiction plot situtions here entertain everyone . this season rewatchable ( more so than later seasons ) not catch dust any collection . it needs re-watched really appreciated . however some aspects jokes not understood everyone who not familiar british culture or know what curry vindaloo ... then again my 12 year old cousin , who never england or remembers much 1990 , doesn't know what vindaloo or even familiar time travel science loves show .	1

oleanna twisted , vicious young woman need bring man ( extention , all men ) down . john , played william macy , college professor . carol , played debra eisenstadt , one his students . when carol seeks help failing grade , john goes out his way help her personally , one one basis . carol more than little irritating john becomes more than little irritated her seeming inability grasp simplist concepts . playing good professor , john faults his pedantic self her failure understand material . days later , john caught off guard when carol maliciously levels charge sexual harrasment against him - just time destroy his bid tenure . her earlier need help set up . carol keeping notes all - cataloging any word or action she might turn against him . carol campaign against john facilitated what she refers " group .

while oliver stone 60's-style " hipness " intrudes too much into characters situations , overall film good honest portrayal nazi-like terror inflicted this country police military beasts human form . associated amnesty international this time i'm well aware real people who tortured , mutilated , raped , murdered , " disappeared " name " western values .

though based famous character phil silver famous oldie tv show , new " sergeant bilko " less homage show than it classic steve martin his 1970 days . though this bilko ( again shifty tireless grafter , evil face non-coms everywhere ) very much opportunist silvers ' character ( he runs base casino ) , shy risk silvers ( unit mobilization orders desert storm mysteriously disappeared ) manages get caught his own dealings silvers ( bilko botches fixing army boxing match , unwittingly tricking each boxer think he one who supposed take fall ) screwball zaniness very much out steve martin snl days . script bilko unit charged testing brand new army weapon - " hovertank " soon cancelled because , among other things , it simply doesn't work . hovertank end spell doom his own cozy position doesn't seem bother bilko , mostly because he lives day-to-day . things change when officer charged evaluating hovertank turns out fearsome major thorn ( phil hartman ) . years earlier , bilko unwittingly made enemy thorn accidentally implicating him one his bitched schemes . now major , thorne isn't simply content enough eliminate hovertank , but must now axe bilko well . they say desperate times reveal man , bilko now revealed spineless weasel his troops come love . martin plays bilko like character one his old snl skits . it sort fun watch guy work material we haven't seen since his more sedate days playing less zany funnymen ( " la story " , " roxanne " ) more mature dramatic roles ( " spanish prisoner " , " grand canyon " update " silas marner " ) . it light breezy you'll probably forget most gags , script under-uses most supporting cast ( especially now late-great phil hartman bilko evil nemesis ) , but it still fun	1
i admit first time i saw this video i laughed out loud . why ? four grown men t-shirts kilts playing rock roll . wow . well , now when i laugh it shear joy ... their fantastic seasoned , fun , high energy performance . bruce plays his heart out ; tony , cool ever , ads his own magic bass ; mark drums -- clear crisp -- really showcases his talent . stuart .... he blast . you see his love affair audience , he gives above beyond energy , extra guitar solos , , well , like i said , you could tell he fun ( not much fun perhaps he berlin peace concert -- man , there he shining , too , but younger " look this crowd !

veteran english teacher i've taught this play all my career i never tire it . although some acting over-the-top times ( consider parents ' reaction helen condition first 10 minutes film ) , this classic nearly flawless . anne bancroft patty duke won well-deserved oscars their dynamic performances andrew prine made career out playing roles like his " jimmie " this film . script intelligently adapted play author william gibson even cleared up vague scene play implied annie might quit kellers . direction sturdy unobtrusive arthur penn who went very distinguished career . this wonderfully insightful inspiring film holds your attention beginning end . it little sentimental times , but that very forgivable . note : patty duke plays helen this film , but 1970 remake television she plays helen teacher annie sullivan . talk clever casting	1

sudden death i got this movie because i powers boothe fan , came like film itself . it gotten lot poor reviews , but i disagree i think film lot value mainly because chemistry actors . my favorite parts film those interaction emily joshua foss ( powers boothe character , never mentioned name except ending credits . ) duel wits these two priceless this best character ( emily ) powers boothe ever plays against my opinion . i believe it bears much more resemblance two `under seige ' films than `die hard ' its critics claim . children make this film so unique , they big part why characters where they , when they ; why plot unfolds way it . there violence , probably young children shouldn't watch it , but older mature teens might like it because emily tyler . this film deals , least surface level , many issues such government ineptitude , job-related disability , divorce/marriage/child custody , more . powers boothe , dorian harewood , colm meaney terrific villains . powers boothe especially plays great sociopath , low baseline mood , superficial charm emotional distance --- although more insight than most . whittni wright plays emily mccord , nothing listed imdb her after this film --- pity really i would love see more her . ross malinger plays tyler mccord he terrific , i'm happy see he moved good things since . film scored john debney , it his worse piece work ; subdued especially action film , unoriginal , not outstanding any way although believe me i've sat through far worse . there official soundtrack release but good luck finding decent-priced copy . debney went wonderful job `passion christ ' , whodathunkit he got well-deserved oscar nomination it . my gripes : this tenth anniversary we please widescreen release i think we've waited long enough , collector edition powers boothe commentary would nice but i won't hold my breath ... not lot extras dvd , but few good behind-the-scenes items ... idea noone needed go inside or outside stadium during game , or noone would cellphone or there would media blackout something like this really stretches credulity . it worth $10.00 price just good piece cinema history . i would like see prequel or sequel , say , emily joshua foss meeting up someday but now i guess thanks `deadwood ' powers boothe too famous sequel ( foss seemed quite dead film end , but this hollywood after all ) . finally : recently audio book `sudden death ' released audiotape narrated powers boothe , it terrific worth price if you find it . if you disliked movie you might like this audiobook , if you liked movie you'll love this audiobook	1
housewife named brandi typical torchlight releases . almost non-existent story horrible , pointless dialog ties together several very long sex scenes . story ? brandi buys computer . she sets up website sell lingerie , where she models lingerie front webcam . people make fun her site , so she starts sex her female friend husband front webcam instead . guy two other girls see site decide same thing steal all her business . end , two camps decide merge . that it far story goes . there six sex scenes . three boy/girl , two girl/girl , one boy/girl/girl . expected torchlight , scenes long , nine thirteen minutes . this good bad . most time it good , because all women video attractive good job during their scenes . few bad moments occur when director gets stuck some shot isn't particularly hot or interesting instead cutting away something else , it just drags one or two minutes . but overall , i thought sex scenes good . there four women video . ander page , april hannah , nicole luv , remy . ander page only one i recognized . she three scenes . audio video quality excellent . there no extras dvd all . i liked this dvd don't regret buying it . but torchlight stuff not something i unconditionally recommend . you not going get story or any dialog even remotely interesting , sex scenes going run three four times longer than what you'd see something like playboy softcore flick . but me , primary reason watch softcore sex scenes , this one delivers area quite nicely	1

this movie provides glimpse into lives lower middle class english youth whom savage battles over football matches never heard towns most important part their otherwise quietly desperate lives . poignant interplay two old men movie somehow made film seem more real even more sad . fight scenes really seemed capture chaos confusion lifestyle . no explanations given no apologies necessary . it held my attention start finish . good watch mature folks ; randomness violence intermixed snippets private life made movie seem more real me . i order this after watching it friend house - he huge soccer fan i believe he picked up movie europe . recommended	1

3 story-arcs classic dr. who , this really good price set , especially one including logopolis castrovalva ( both which i've tempted vhs just see them again ) . these part iconic tom baker run 4th doctor end his final season role . k9 gone , romana . he wears his plum digs suit somber mood his last 2 stories : keeper traken , logopolis , castrovalva . disc one : set opens keeper traken which reintroduces master ( absent since showdown doctor deadly assassin ) . end his 13th incarnation ( 12th regeneration ) he stays shadows ( so speak ) much 1st half this one , but end he literally new man . this one introduces nyssa , eventually become new zo� , brainy-girl board tardis , while adric , equally brainy but not really sensible also board all 3 these ( when they learn super-genius kid annoying archetype ) . plot this one shaky but necessary reoccurring role master 5th doctors run . disc two : next logopolis . if keeper traken somber , then logopolis literally wake before funeral . doctor more visable distressed over leaving romana e-space ( still waiting dvd e-space 3 set ) . his plans fix long broken tardis chameleon circuit logopolis . before doing so , he must find real police call-box measure , but doing so inadvertently lands around " new master " tardis , which ultimately leads death doctor ( well mortal wounding anyway ) . loads moody shots , out tardis , lots quirky labyrinthine scenes future companion tegan lost onboard . new master terrifically , theatrically hammy plays nicely off baker manic energy ( although substantially drained his standards , character doctor seems stoically accepted his impending death baker stoically accepts his retirement . ) he leaves top his game here , great , great story . disc three : castrovalva introduces 5th , youngest doctor ( time i'm not sure tennant age ) . peter davidson , brings character away 4th doctor style borrows heavily older doctors ( spite his youth , he plays it more like stogy old original incarnation played william hartnell . ) when filming , shooting order altered so , although this first new doctor episodes , it shot after four doomsday ( story 2 season ) . so davidson knew where his regeneration addled transformation would end up , because he already filmed wholly recuperated doctor . but process hard one , castrovalva opens immediately after doctor regeneration , his companions try get him safety , narrowly escaping master , or so it seems . while doctor struggles retain/ regain his wits ( see brilliant scenes doctor struggling not lose his way unraveling 4th doctor iconic scarf ) . crew falls deeper into master web traps arrive castrovalva , appropriately named after m.c. escher work . great start new doctor . new beginnings : drinking games drink whenever you hear " cloister bell " ( ringing which means emanate danger or drunkenness)drink when master watches / rebukes doctor gloomy safety his tardis console room . drink whenever one actor or character replaces via regeneration / body snatching / disguise or miscasting . drink whenever someone misplaces doctor ( including himself ) . drink whenever anyone declares : " but , doctor there ! " drink when any tardis crew complains . this one pays off !	1

this movie pinnacle blaxploitation films . lead character black man who wrongfully imprisoned then cruelly experimented jail . when he gets out , he unique pinnochio-esque talent . but , it not his nose grows ... think lower longer ( ha , ha ) . i could not stop laughing he killed his enemies his " secret weapon " . this movie not meant taken serious , but it accomplishes something other blaxploitation films this time not ... truly unique storyline	1

first all , i'd like point out incident mentioned review lupis1 takes place second season jeeves wooster , not third . however , i agree this season some very good episodes ( though not good second season ) . major fault i jeeves wooster dvds , like many dvds same genre , there little none way special features . " interactive menu " not count special feature . i would like see some audio commentaries some bbc dvds -- see what hugh laurie , stephen fry ferdinand fairax say process turning wodehouse memorable characters book screen . characters incredible , plot-lines hysterical . best episode " hot off press " .	1
this series deserved more seasons than it , though final season wrapped things up quite nicely . i still think resolution end rather un-fair though . those who haven't seen end episode , i am not going give it away . but introduction new mainstream characters , only lifespan one season ... can't good . but over all review , i very much enjoyed third final season .	1

i hadn't seen this while until recently , it still me my toes . this came out when i high school , but i didn't see it until after i graduated ... but i remember hype it " racy " . i really didn't know what think it first ... but after seeing it few times , it grew me . maybe it sex ... or crime drama thriller ... killers getting away killing ... or combination above . i remember hearing reading stone mixed-review performance beforehand , but after seeing it myself , i personally thought it fit character . you never really trust her , although times you almost want . i hadn't even really seen douglas any movies before this . if you liked this , than fatal attraction must see well ( i didn't see fa until after this one ) . throw here beautiful score jerry goldsmith ( which classical musician i noticed ) , well what become one my favorite dance tracks since i heard it high school , la tour " blue " dance club scene roxy . far flaws , i agree reviewer realism her antics she getting questioned . what wrong these guys , what really makes her so special ? they really haven't seen anything like her , polygraph guy says ? that main thing bothered me , but it movie , long you know , don't take it too seriously . there lots funny moments , esp . curran friend gus ... " that magna cum laude ***** fried up your brain ! " i didn't know this same director starship troopers showgirls , but this far better 3 . i think this one those movies where you either like it or you don't . again , movies aren't always supposed realistic , so just appreciate it what it . some movies keep you watching it more than once , others don't ... you don't always valid reason why . me , this just one those movies :)	1

many reviews here already indicate , this film not everyone taste . set dublin , it reflects something sensibility modern irish drama , its harsh , black-comic edges its ambivalence sentimentality . ensemble piece loosely weaves together more plot threads than viewer hope follow or account after seeing whole film , it capable cast skillfully portraying broad range characters , not any them particularly sympathetic , though you find yourself cheering some their small victories . yes , colin farrell fun watch charming but sociopathic skinhead . but all their brief fragmented moments screen , there standouts rest cast well , including colm meaney , whose character seems wish he tough cop " miami vice , " wistful kelly macdonald young woman who just wants steady man , even if he married , cillian murphy her totally hapless boyfriend job he hates stocking shelves supermarke t.t he movie farcical riff many different forms anger . almost everyone grievances lead them everything rage depression , which many viewers begin wear thin after while . there exhilarating relief while we witness spectacular bus crash , later film cuts back forth two simultaneous car chases , each them ending badly . finally resolving all this high-powered negative energy bit more than this film manage , ending rather unsuccessfully brings us soft landing . but then endings not easy anyway , what you remember film its oddball moments , which capture better than anything desperate measures people take while looking love all wrong places	1

i bought this movie because i love see old tale tespun retold . if it well there nothing better read or watch . this movie not retelling " beauty beast " its title premise would indicate . i own several versions " beauty beast " dvd print . after reading reviews here i really looking forward adding this movie my collection i excited chance watch this movie . i thought it going great ! but it worst movie i ever purchased . i prepared horses i prepared nudity eroticism . i not prepared filmmaker mangling " beauty beast " . what blurb box suggests . but instead getting beauty beast message redeeming power love , you get half-hearted sermon against bestiality . i didn't know such problem this world . i mean i never urge i don't know anyone who . there no reports news people sexually assaulting livestock i heard . i am sure i would heard something if such case . there no excuse what borowczyk here . movie starts out slow , i forgive , i attention span ( too many people don't . ) story starts pick up momentum promise when beast appears . then story heads cliff unhesitatingly dives off ! i saw kernel good movie here . what happened ? yourself favor . skip this one	-1
after i enjoyed martin scorcese " departed " , i decided watch film inspired celebrated director re-make it move action hong kong boston , ma , usa . i must say i liked original movie better : 50 minutes shorter than scorcese magnificent remake , " infernal affairs " tighter , faster , more compelling tells same story better . it not grand acting jack nicholson who basically plays daryl van horne attitude " infernal affairs "' characters don't talk don't curse much they " departed " but hong kong movie only benefits it . much i admire leonardo dicaprio bill castigan , tony leung ( yan ) his role simply unforgettable	1

there so many possibilities . this spy thriller . it works several levels , quite bit comedy keep it light . i interpreted much character development satire british people themselves . hitchcock careful . those last days before war british censors tough . if british didn't see humor it , i'm sure americans . you two chuckle-headed school chums prattling endlessly criket . cheating barrister his vapid paramour both married back england parnoid found out . then there miss froy , ( dame may whitty ) old , sterotypical spinister governess . even heroine , iris , played margret lockwood , blond ( naturally ) beautiful airhead , her facile , soon boyfriend , gilbert ( michael redgrave ) . miss froy goes missing train without getting off . she just made aquaintance iris then , poof , disappears . iris help gilbert seeks find her annoyance most everyone aboard train . but miss froy isn't what she appears . she secret agent british germans want kidnap her . only they weren't germans . order not offend nazis time , germany simply refered middle european country . they phony , german sounding accents like evil psychiatrist who identified czech . brits pulled themselves together when crisis hits . train stopped attacked police . miss froy amazingly nimble old lady . she jumps out train window evades 24 young men shooting her . hilarious . she gets back england before everyone else . see this . if your not hitchcock fan you maybe after seeing this , one his last movies before he moved hollywood .	1

this documentary , released concurrently hard-cover book same name 1991 , brief but highly accurate overview life art billie holiday . book , text robert o'meally , contains literally hundreds rare photographs , good deal these liberally sprinkled throughout film . but ultimately , it sparsely produced but flawlessly executed narrative her life craft make this dvd stand out among few biographical pieces released great lady day . film contains interviews several billie closest friends musicians who worked her . insight provided fellow jazz-singers friends carmen mcrae annie ross indeed enlightening , but it observances her fellow musicians , mal waldron , buck clayton harry " sweets " edison , well particularly eloquent comments writer jazz historian albert murray , make this documentary particularly illuminating . there snatches billie greatest recordings , which consist excerpts illustrate exactly what so unique lady genius , often accompanied explanations what made her music so important , or perfectly timed clips jazz audiences dancers day , reveling music . one point , trumpet player harry edison remarks billie jazz musician , way she used her voice , " attacked words could swing just like trumpet player " . his comment immediately followed brief clip her 1936 recording " i can't give you anything but love " ( teddy wilson his band ) which she exactly emulates sound instrument her voice . albert murray sweets edison carefully explain , once all , billie not blues singer , but jazz singer - very best jazz singer , while buck clayton , carmen mcrae mal waldron clarify billie first vocalist use her voice dramatically , change melody phrasing songs fit her mood , improvise written music create form art original it unique . they make you understand billie holiday literally influenced every singer came after her ; this film makes it possible someone little prior knowledge her , or her craft , understand exactly why she such important influential figure both popular music jazz singing . simply put , billie holiday changed way singers sang songs , this film articulates this fact vivid clarity . film goes out its way ( book ) correct some more glaring inaccuracies her biography , not flinch somewhat sordid sensational details her tragically short pain-filled life . same time , portrait one someone who certainly enjoy their life fullest despite tragedy , billie revealed basically happy cheerful ( if often abused ) person she really . throughout we hear actress ruby dee read some more accurate portions billie " autobiography " - lady sings blues , book she didn't write , probably never even read . also worthy note contributions producer milt gabler , who relates story behind billie biggest hit , " lover man " , which he produced decca records 1944 . there also well-orchestrated effective buildup song " strange fruit " , social political aspects which carefully explained milt gabler ( who labels it , " first important protest song " ) . he relates columbia records refused record it , fear " bad press boycotts " their southern dealers . annie ross says , " i knew it banned , i knew why it banned " , while carmen mcrae simply states , " just straight up facts , you know , way it those days " while they all express their admiration billie her brave stance african american , who dared sing song lynching pre-civil rights era 1939 . discussion followed late clip billie , looking absolutely radiant , singing song before television audience , while accompanied mal waldron piano . expressions drama etched her face while she runs through powerful lyrics , ( " southern trees bear strange fruit , blood leaves , blood root ; black bodies swinging southern breeze , strange fruit hanging poplar trees " ) right through dramatic climax , ( " ... sun rot , tree drop , here strange bitter crop " ) make this video potent testament her amazing valor artistic perfection . there other rare wonderful ( if much too brief ) video clips billie holiday her best , sometimes , stark shocking end her life . one clip begins particularly sickly , ghostly looking billie , her appearance nothing less than alarming , but clip progresses we realize poor video quality , combined unflattering camera angle bad lighting , make her look far worse than she really . moment later camera switches angles , relief we see she far more elegant healthy-looking than she appears onset clip . we also get brief scenes her only film , new orleans , louis armstrong , made 1947 . while billie sings song " blues brewin '" , close-ups give us rare glimpse into what it must like experience real billie holiday ; she sings words , " ... suppose you want somebody , but you ain't got nobody , you only got gleam your eye ... " , her expressions absolutely brilliant . there not only gleam her eye , there wrinkle her brow , lilt her gestures contractions her facial muscles , all combined , communicate range feeling show expression lesser singers could never hope convey . priceless . climax film celebrated clip her singing her composition , " fine mellow " famous 1956 television special , voice jazz . accompanied several her peers jazz world , including ben webster , lester young , roy eldridge gerry mulligan , cameraman wisely chose concentrate billie face , even soloists took their individual turns , we get delightful look billie playfully nodding her head time beat , appreciation talents her fellow musicians clearly showing her eyes motions . some viewers expressed disappointment fact more video clips billie not presented here , forgetting ( unfortunately ) there very few video records remaining her performances . i believe i now seen , through this other available videos , most her surviving video performances , this film contain some very best them . but inclusion those few precious video clips notwithstanding , it explanation billie art clear articulation her genius make this documentary so gratifying . film closes story her life , albert murray comments , end , it , " eloquence , universality her statement matters " most , while carmen mcrae reflects , although much billie voice gone time she recorded " lady satin " , there something her voice , even then , could evoke intense feeling , miss mcrae says she still plays album , cries . over credits , we hear few bars " i'm fool want you " lady satin , we instantly know exactly why carmen mcrae found it so moving . highly recommended .	1

if one film could some up ouevre jean luc godard it would probably ' band outsiders ' .. it great example french new wave .. many godard pictures plot not important - its like he saying - yeah , yeah , we've seen this plot million times before lets just use it means improvisation .. raoul cotard cinematography we see paris all its glory - filming streets like no one else .. yet despite all this playfulness ' band outsiders ' plays one godard most wistful , melancholic films .. maybe it score legrand ( who capable much better ) - but everytime i see this movie combination music image never fails make me get extremely tired actually doze off - i like this movie ! yet this what makes me hesitate calling it godard best ( though it contains some his best moments ) .. so i would say this must godard fans .. my personal favorites godard ' breathless ' ' pierrot le fou ' - although it hard beat minute silence ..	1

i sat through this entire film even after my wife begged me turn it off then stormed out room watch tv living room . she bored tears felt premise unbelievably stupid . little she know , i completely agreed i just this thing only seeing part movie . i finish it , even if i knew i gonna hate it . me idea anthony hopkins could black man so unbelievable i couldn't even begin concentrate meat film . i understand novel acclaimed everything , everyone , even critics feel this film loyal novel , but if that case then novel can't great . if they chosen actor i could believed it maybe , i mean , i light skinned black friends i know they could pass white , but when they tell you their black you see features ... anthony hopkins whiter than i am ... there no way i could pass black so hopkins out . really if it weren't excellent acting parts hopkins , kidman harris this movie would no redeeming qualities . so here you it , young black man looks white , realizes it easier just play white then who you , he disowns his family live his life easy , he becomes teacher now his 70 he accused racist people who think he white so he starts affair much younger woman whos drunk husband wants kill them both , he , then his secret exposed this guy who wants write book him . i just such hard time getting over idea some idiot thought anthony hopkins could black i can't even see this movie good it . i'm sorry ; this review probably so tainted it not even funny . all i know this great movie , i mean even premise something i would normally really enjoy it just so hard get over ... i'm rambling ... never mind . like i said , i really tried	1

when ellen evans directed this movie she managed get sex scenes energy , passion , sensuality , creativity . fans softcore know how rare these things . just how skilled director accomplish them . which make directors cut this movie ( which sold here ) such mystery . my only guess when she given chance reedit this film she wanted make version she could watch her 14 year old daughter , or maybe she trying get job hallmark channel . what ever reason if you fan oxygen network buy directors cut , if you fan softcore get original version .	-1
i disagree totally above reviewer . these films excellent . only one i am not thrilled hill , all others very good wwii films . i waiting command decision long time . this collection not disappoint	1
this one single most beautiful films i ever seen . unfortunately , i found story line just bearable . there lot fantasy involved perhaps it metaphor something i haven't grasped yet . regardless , it just didn't pan out me end i found myself wishing it better written . said , i need reiterate : this one single most beautiful films i ever seen . there one particularly bad cg sequence , but beyond , it visual masterpiece , hence five star rating despite lackluster storyline . i highly recommend it if only sheer unequaled beauty cinematography .	1
after long wait i am pleasantly surprised find out mary hartman still one most off-the-wall funny shows emerge 70 . i stuck how it borrowed likes david lynch , john waters , king hill mike judje . sony thanks putting out , but you cheapskates could coughed up more episodes !	1
i rented this movie mostly because they goof it " 40 year old virgin . " i like caruso csi miami , but i begun see caruso always plays david caruso . yet , here he plays even less cheerful cop . what fun . his character jade so stoic he makes dirty harry look like neurotic . sadly , this one those erotic thrillers neither thrilling nor erotic . it better than your usual shannon tweed erotic thriller twaddle , mostly because you get chaz palminteri supporting character rather than , say , william katt . plot makes no sense , however , sex scenes boring . if you want good-looking sex , rent some porn . if you want good thriller , rent rear window .	1
i never heard this series , but i recognized geoffrey palmer one my favorite britcoms " time goes " . although this series 70 it still seems relevant very entertaining . i adore ria rants boredom housewife . her flirtations leonard cute touching . both ria leonard deal feelings life passing much too quickly whether or not they living it their fullest	1
never even heard this 2002 when this released , 2002 great year itself sci-fi . we star wars ep2 , solaris my favourite sci-fi film up point ... minority report . then only couple weeks ago , went down my local hmv store saw this shelves sale . my expectations wasnt very high , but i am big fan . bale me , he always engaging . after putting this , 107 minutes later , i hooked . not way i utterly impressed like minority report when i first watched it , but somehow , it certainly me thinking movie theme , gunkata fight sequences , which so awesomely jaw-dropping it outdid anything matrix ever fraction its budge t.t hen i watched it again commentary , i caught all details i missed out first time . then it hit me , this great film . no , make it supreme film . 2nd time around , i noticed cinemtography production design , which word , beautiful . story , which whilst not original , definitely very engaging . 1984 , fahrenheit 451 movies come mind , but they never this entertanining . make this 1984 this millennium , movie moves ultra slick pace matrix , but more deep rooted theme dystopia control worlds apart philosophies twists walchowski bros . way , it simple story , but simple stories told well acted well also profound long lasting . acting , i believe bale role his best . it not easy notice first he plays cold , ruthless cleric despatches resistance hardly blink . but his physical abilities fluid movements shows off bale capabilities action hero give keanu neo run his money . but what augments this immeasurably his ability act ... slowly emote over length film . catch scene where he awakes sunrise first time , able feel appreciate it even this simple act . emily watson short but very effective role woman who first instigate him think turning . their scenes not easiest , yet tension eventual connection they make through just looks slightest dialogue . sean bean always equally memorable his very brief role bale partner . round it up good performances taye diggs angus mcfadden this movie surpasses usual sci-fi stilted acting we so often bombarded . kurt wimmer , director also smart director . instead giving us cliches , he gives us situations which you might not necessarily expect , short but stunning fight sequences instead prolonged fights explosions/stunts which only hampers story pace . ultimately , it movie rewards subsequent viewings , may explain why this turned into such cult classic among its devoted followers , myself included . fan fiction fan videos already extended world libria pay homage movie its characters . while it may never reach dizzying heights matrix , it doesnt need . this film not masses , but those who really appreciate its intentions its strong visuals ( despite its lack budget ) eventually , theme behind it . kurt himself says , its more numbness towards everything how one man reacts it finds himself liberated simplest things we take granted . myself , i enjoy rewatching this only best sci-fi movies compel me so . it simply not just sci-fi cult classic , it geniune masterpiece genre rarely produces one	1
this film not only severely biased , but it fails explain why israel would deliberately attack their only ally . time friendly fire attack there huge explosion near el-arish where israel fighting egyptian troops . because israel attacked sea day earlier , they presumed egyptian warship firing them . us never even informed israel ship 22 miles off coast , it not even supposed there first place , joint chiefs staff repeatedly cabled liberty previous night instructions withdraw distance one hundred miles egyptian israeli coasts . short this film only matches venemous lies anti-semitic , anti-israel websites which preach hatred	-1

( read my entire opinion before deciding how much you like ' crimson ' -- after all , i give it 4 stars . dialogue way more important than most films this genre . ) i remember jean reno " professional " which i really liked , otherwise description crimson not enough convince me watch . i am glad i watch ! it very enjoyable film . description cover most reviews i've seen left me thinking this just long long list tales this genre . it -- then again it much more than . , there more than enough surpises keep even cynic like me interested . i watched it again right away -- , really , because ... movie far easier watch if you fluent french , which i am not . like all native english-speaking people , i find europeans speak lot faster than americans . crimson , actors speak very natural pace fine french . because it subtitled english , however , makes it impossible keep up because it also action movie so you need focus first action , yet there lot dialogue you need read -- dialogue no way superfluous . say , dialogue important . still , it very good movie , just aware you frequently reversing dvd pick up many things because there nuances surprise or three tucked there , which also good thing . example , near very beginning there something many viewers find very ' interesting ' -- though different people assign different things it -- but you'll reading subtitles , only catch hint it later deep movie , which means some point you may want go back ( it took me ' til very end movie realize i thought maybe there ' something ' scene then i went back , but even then i needed dialogue ' see ' what happening , i watch scene dozen times sure what i seeing . then again , you might very well ' get ' it right away ! lol but i doubt it)*much i enjoy movie i feel duty advise you translations used subtitles frequently not even close french spoken movie . very well-scripted film like crimson gets hobbled bit number poor translations . enjoy movie , allow some extra time doubling back pick up some very interesting things you didn't quite ' get ' .

lolita , based controversial novel vladimir nabokov , who wrote screenplay stanley kubrick , but kubrick disregarded it ( i read this wikipedia ) . read novel assignment college , i thought this movie going obscene novel ( without downplaying book , i mean only lustful utterances character humbert humbert ) . kubrick cleverly builds up sexual tension humbert humbert lolita , while charlotte haze blinded her mature age her need finding man herself , not pay attention evident lust humbert humbert her daughter , flirtings her precocious child . there big lesson this movie one humbert humbert fails pay attention : ' universe not revolve around you . ' when he realizes it , lolita already fled away after held secret affair quilty ( peter sellers ) , who turns out stalking , deceiving man , person much more dangerous than humbert humbert himself , one we thought sexual predator , but who , end story revealed just pathetic sick man . what could very nasty movie , surely cut , or even prohibited censors ( sexual situations just insinuated ) , instead drama seasoned comical overtones , like when motel , humbert humbert valet trying deploy collapsible bed , while lolita sleeps . sidenote , i wish stanley kubrick peter sellers could worked together more projects , peter sellers great both lolita dr. strangelove ; surely peters sellers best actors history cinematography . while novel , vladimir nabokov kills all ' sinners ' his story ( lolita dies during childbirth ) , here kubrick lolita , she survives . not scared away classification this movie art movie or cult classic , stanley kubrick didn't shoot his movies elite intellectuals , but all us who enjoy good story	1

while watching this film , i found myself irritated whining bickering goes , wondering how it could better . hanging up tells tale three sisters : meg ryan eve , bulwark family , runs her own business ; diane keaton georgia her own self titled magazine ; lisa kudrow matty , somewhat vapid soap opera actress . their elderly father ( walter matthau his last movie role ) memory problems , can't walk admitted hospital . he going die . ryan daughter who saddled responsibility her father , while other two too self-centered even care . all this could made compelling " dramedy " but director keaton allows over emoting all conflict override gentler side losing parent . matthau not all likeable either . cloris leachman brief appearance his ex-wife adam arkin ryan globetrotting husband . it surprising most honest moment film comes brief sequence ryan mother doctor whose car she crashed into hospital parking garage . ryan tries gamely hold movie together although she quite good , she can't really salvage film . keaton kudrow both adequate , but no depth observed . matthau more like matthau than true character it sad his last role so unlikeable . hanging up tries tackle sensitive real issues but it so contrived it fails	1

frank julia forbidden love affair focus hellraiser , but cenobites stole show . this time around cenobites given lot more screen time . dr. channard , man dark obsessions , devotes his life researching infernal netherworld . kirsty becomes his latest patient his psychiatric hospital , after hearing events took place first movie , channard decides reanimate evil julia . he agrees bring her victims so she continue regenerating , exchange she his guide labyrinth hell . christopher young music awesome . loud , dramatic , ominous - movie theme during opening credits lets viewers know what they're getting into . his music also very significant during scene when tiffany solves puzzle box . music conveys tiffany childlike innocence her sense wonder she handles studies box . tone speed music ( tiffany manipulates box ) raises tension fever pitch . then , after deafening silence , movie theme erupts gateway hell unlocked , cenobites once again freed walk earth . their spectacular entrance this scene even more impressive than first movie when they appeared after kirsty solved box . this scene also when pinhead delivers most important line hellraiser ii : " it not hands call us - it desire . " but you need hear doug bradley delivery line it any affect you . line may look laughable , but it powerful so significant because it speaks volumes nature cenobites . it seems cenobites not slaughter someone who solves box unless person desire see what happens when box solved - even if person doesn't know what happen when box solved . would explain why they wanted torture kirsty first movie . since tiffany wanted solve box simply sake solving puzzle , she spared . she no idea anything would happen when she solved box . raises questions nature game - since cenobites obviously knew it channard who called them , why didn't they go after him ? or they think it kirsty who called them ? channard no qualms all when he people killed , yet he timid man . it clear he expects julia protect him whatever unknown terrors lurking hell . channard ultimately finds what he looking - pays painful price . there cenobite battle hellraiser ii , which disappointing because it so one-sided . there reason this though , case you don't get it when you watch movie , it explained audio commentary . dvd audio commentary ashley laurence , director tony randel writer peter atkins . their commentary very descriptive informative . they gently poke fun their mistakes , this makes commentary more enjoyable . lord knows there some glaring mistakes . but anyone besides me notice hostility seems exist randel atkins ? thought them sharing mutual dislike each other grudgingly doing this commentary together gives me perverse pleasure . i loved this movie up until kirsty reunion frank . point this movie goes hell ( manner speaking ) . it would nice if script dropped dumb subplot kirsty looking her father - even if left no reason kirsty character this movie . it near end movie when pinhead delivers his infamous line " your suffering legendary - even hell . " but even pinhead wit can't uplift last half hour this movie . but it pretty funny see patients tearing hospital apart - just how they get their hands all those puzzle boxes ? different actress plays female cenobite hellraiser ii - she less menacing this movie , but still entertaining . i glad see she still bloodlust so evident first movie . but i would preferred it if she didn't sound so nonchalant when she talking , i missed wide-eyed stare actress first movie . chatterer different face one point hellraiser ii , which confused me until i heard audio commentary . personally , i preferred chatterer original face . it real surprise when chatterer identity revealed . without giving away too much , it involves shocking scene - murder child . ending hellraiser ii made no sense whatsoever , but i'm guessing filmmakers wanted wait until sequel explain what going hell . yes , this writing i only seen first two movies hellraiser series . hellraiser ii also reveals pinhead background . needless say i disappointed - i preferred think cenobites lovecraftian origins . i even dreamed up whole history mythology cenobites after seeing first movie ! but i loved look dread despair pinhead face ( right before undergoing his `surgery ' ) toward end movie - you know if someone like him fearing his own safety then he must serious danger . how mighty fallen . buy soundtrack this dvd so you properly savour first two-thirds this movie	1

view askewniverse , you start wonder if any actors kevin smith movies manage break out characters they associated ( exception , course jason lee ben affleck ) . any jersey locals who act these films bankable career ? jay mewes started shed his " jay " character , but he going something better than " bottoms up . " i'd love see brian o'halloran something big well marilyn ghigliotti . jeff anderson , however , turns surprise not only acting gig , but writing directoral one well . it really good firs t-t ime outing guy who you feel got " railroaded " into acting world " clerks . " i almost hate compare this kevin smith flick , but anderson manages turn out romantic comedy par " chasing amy " but without world monologues kevin smith characters seem inhabit . don't get me wrong , kevin brilliant dialogue , but i imagine some viewers , they get lost all talking , witticisms , inside jokes . so flame me i dare blaspheme say anderson churned out something par ( or maybe slightly better than ) " chasing amy .

`lord flies ' made into movie least twice since william golding novel same name became cult classic / must read volume high school college students late 1950s . first version , which follows novel very closely , black white noted director , peter brook 1963 . second version color harry hook released 1990 . like many remakes same language , one immediately wonders why bother , original brook version more than gripping enough convey message novel . highlight differences two versions , let me outline story shared two versions . scene set when airplane carrying school children crashes south pacific , coast remote tropical island . approximately 30 children , ages 6 13 make it shore gather beach work out how they survive assume since they far removed their original destination island small uninhabited , there good chance it take long time , if ever , grown-ups find rescue them . first two principle characters ralph , one two or three oldest boys who we meet first , company intelligent , bespectacled , slightly overweight boy same age known `piggy ' . third main character jack , old fit ralph . three minor named characters simon , who prone fainting `seeing things ' sam eric , pair twins . early vote sets up ralph leader , few rules establishing conch shell found ralph piggy first reel symbol right speak gathering boys . jack immediately assumes responsibility leader `gang ' ( later become `tribe ' ) hunters who also take responsibility maintaining signal fire which ralph succeeds lighting using piggy eyeglass lens means concentrating sunlight clump tinder . jack gang gets involved too much hunting allows signal fire go out just aircraft flies near island . soon , story evolves presence monster island . this creates pretext jack split off group his tribe create camp more defensible location . this larger group becomes more more primitive , they raid ralph camp steal piggy specs since it only means they starting fires . placate monster , head killed wild pig cut its carcass stood top pole near suspected monster lair offering monster . after few days , simon observes this pig head its very large collection flies feasting festering flesh imagines he hears pigs head speak him , hence , source title . simon then killed when hunters mistake him night monster . when ralph piggy walk jack camp recover piggy specs , piggy killed `accident ' when jack tribe members pry large boulder loose falls piggy . ralph jack fight , ralph driven off , whole tribe sets fire jungle flush out ralph , presumably , kill him . both stories end ralph runs beach find himself feet very professionally uniformed member his country elite armed services . hook spices up dialogue making boys much more hip lots swear words references contemporary popular shows such alf miss piggy muppets . unfortunately , hook looses two most important elements whole story . beginning novel , subtly , beginning brook film , we see world once more war boys several different schools plane australia find relative safety coming ( nuclear ? ) conflict . hook shows nothing this , giving us simply group boys same military academy trip goodness knows where . this totally looses whole allegorical sense story where conflict boys mirrors war world large , especially sense last scene where world ( island ) destroyed conflict ( fire ) . second major oversight hook rendition there never enough attention given significance pig head , simon vision , sense `the lord flies ' . less important point origin monster myth different two movies . brook film follows book it misinterpretation billowing parachute fallen , dead pilot . hook creates myth out spasms downed plane delirious pilot he finds refuge cave rediscovered simon who believes he monster . both movies credible job depicting fall nominally civilized boys into savagery myth . combat ralph jack near end straight out frazier `the golden bough ' myth killing king . unfortunately , hook version seems eviscerated pig carcass , all great allegorical original story totally lost . , minimal they , i even think boys ' performances brook version better , their initial innocence face this loss civilization makes their transformation all more interesting . brook version highly recommended .	1

although some films here overlap some other early film dvds out there ( such edison set ' lumi�re brothers ' first films ' ) , there also some films here can't found anywhere else , it provides very nice introduction subject someone who just getting into these very early short films dawn motion pictures . categories include edison films , films lumi�re brothers , keystone short ( featuring charming mabel normand leading role ) , biograph short , max linder short , short french films , short documentary-style films , two very early film classics ' le voyage dans la lune ' ' great train robbery ' ( latter beautifully select hand-coloring ) . basically , it gives viewer good sampling various different types films made 1890s early teens . these very early films like literally looking back time , this bygone world , world where moving image so new revolutionary people didn't care movies only lasted under minute showed things like employees leaving factory or two babies quarreling , since they'd never seen these miraculously moving pictures before . it also opens short 1994 film ' homage eadweard muybridge , ' who invented zoopraxiscope , which projected series pictures way suggested movement . he one pioneers invention motion picture , even though here we're seeing series photography ( 1877-85 ) , not actual motion pictures . ( those who offended such things should aware woman these series photography " films " naked , times partially other times fully , though there absolutely nothing sexual or pornographic here ; it just series images woman who so happens not any clothes . ) my one complaint this disc ( other than mislabelling ' i.b. dam whole dam family ' ' whole dam family dam dog ' ) most films don't any dates given . even if one already familiar films this era instead new fan , it still nice them placed into historic context see years they all made . some bonus features also would nice , provided , say , some background films , people who made them , restoration process , what film-making like these very early days . it always nice supplemental information enjoy appreciate these antique films even more	1

first time i saw this movie - several years ago - i not very impressed . but now , today , it appeals me much more . i appreciate it upon 2nd or 3rd or 4th viewing . it definitely worth one collection . leslie caron fine little actress , her leading man very believeable filthy-rich , bored-with-life snob . until he tangles sweet , funny , gay , enchanting gigi . she softens him , falls love him , when she blossoms giddy schoolgirl into charming , alluring adult ( teen-ager ? ) , help her grandmother sophisticated aunt , his eyes opened , he definitely hooked , all ends well . " but it , you'll like it ! " i would given it 5-star rating but fact i thought there bit too much maurice chevalier i t.p.s. - it offer english subtitles . maybe french too , i don't remember . ( plot laid france .	1

i ordered this dvd amazon because most stores charging twice price so i didn't even mind shipping charges . it also came perfect condition	1
enjoyable many levels : coming age story , portrait strange subculture ( both repo men , la punks early 80 ) , diverting light science fiction , simple slice americana . not one greats any means , but it stands up bears multiple viewings .	1

" midnight marquee " series great idea , offering two old aip films one dvd , this one definitely worth , but primarily first film , " abominable dr. phibes . " " phibes " seems get better time . it stylish , classy horror film great cast , comic relief genuinely comic , grisly sense fun . price plays variation his " henry jarrod " character " house wax , " man grotesquely disfigured fire who hides himself behind more presentable mask sets out extract revenge those whom he believes wronged him . but he may even more demented . murders clever , if bit gross , but even so , we still manage root phibes . price quite wonderful unorthodox role ( character only speak artificially , which meant all his lines post-recorded ) deco trappings very attractive . since resolution left open-ended , sequel almost inevitable . " dr. phibes rises again " adequate follow-up , but falls several notches below original . it almost though everyone going through motions because inevitability sequel , but their hearts aren't it . everyone except co-star robert quarry , who takes things quite seriously . result , he very effective dorian gray-ish type part , but he also comes off though he not really joke . nowhere near stylish , or even logical , " dr. phibes rises again " still its moments -- bumbling policemen lot fun -- but it remains something disappointment	1

all i say , wow ! blame it my watched dallesandro movies " reverse " - viewed blood dracula flesh frankenstein , i prepared stone-faced portrayal dallesandro ... perpetual sneer worn over rigid , blank expression dallesandro " trademark " both films . instead i blown away fresh faced boy , beautiful smile , expressive face dancing eyes . wow ! this film must any dallesandro fan . quality film grainy , sound equally grainy little jumpy- but once you get used these deficiencies , you quickly get caught up story . i use term " story " loosely since , what i understand , entire thing shot without script - allowing actors simply ad-lib . it may , story line unfolds fascinating manner . once again , i disappointed find no commentary or interview dallesandro included special features . instead you get commentary morrrissey that only slightly interesting . i highly question his assertion he making some grand statement this movie . i think now , he wants looks back history pull grand statement , what then , only meant entertainment . but then i've always found morrissey little egotistical . ( besides which , i think morrissey should kicked turning dallesandro into stone-faced actor who wasn't allowed smile . ) people should know while this no means pornography , graphic male nudity makes this unsuitable young viewers .	1

though he long admired his rigorous almost ritualistic approach filmmaking , while he created number unforgettable narrative films , it likely herzog remembered his unique approach documentary . fact , hindsight , what appeals most his narrative films documentary elements -- where reality interjects itself . consider heart glass , example : narrative interesting but obscure , but what stunning document entire crew non-actors , ordinary villagers , who submitted filmed under hypnosis . or take stroszek . it very interesting story dream america represents some europeans , violence loneliness relationships , but what makes it unforgettable scene towards end live chickens who trained take part very bizarre set performances roadside attraction , way this real element comments narrative . this even more true fitzcarraldo ( whose making documented this film ) , where insane ambition main character -- bring opera natives -- manner realizing this -- dragging massive boat over mountain order make fortune accessing remote rubber trees -- where portrayal this insane ambition character made much more powerful realization it actually filmmakers . given , it fitting herzog himself should documented , since his large life lives he captures his films . here he documented process making film man who monumental but bizarre dreams achieves them ; course process making film mirrors its subject . one my favorite scenes film herzog rejecting vigorously idea " nature beautiful " yet insisting its ugliness , fecund horror nature , precisely what he loves it ( spite his better judgment ) . hier ist ein autentischer mensch ! reviewer compared this film unfavorably hearts darkness . it true there aren't many " oh my god i can't believe ... " type moments this film -- but part because coppola it over his head just barely made it through alive sane ( course two stunning films show it : apocalypse now his wife document his own descent ) . what we see this film just such insane scenario herzog not over his head because he precisely his element . ( still , i wish somebody would give criterion type treatment " hearts darkness " " apocalypse now " : imagine dvd set both versions apocalypse now " hearts darkness " special feature ! ) some great extras come criterion set , including wonderful fitting little documentary ( especially errol morris fans ) called " werner herzog eats his shoe " which herzog fulfills promise errol morris , well , eating his shoe .	1

it not lord rings : return king , this film would - should - won academy award best picture . while o'brien fans may quibble how closely details align novels , this outstanding picture nearly every respect . crowe ( captain jack aubrey ) down , acting superb , believable , effecting . title role , crowe manifests - both demonstrative action subtle coaching - attributes leadership , rich this film . costumes , editing cinematography outstanding . uniforms , equipment , weapons , food ( yes , including weevils ) take you his britannic majesty navy early 19th century . story line good balance edge-of-the-seat action quieter , reflective moments examining superstition , duty , conscience character . scene hms surprise " rounds horn " harrowing , leaving viewer wonder , how men such ships sail world ? doctor naturalist stephan maturin ( played paul bettany ) contrasts dutiful jack aubrey conscience not insignificant biological insight inspires aubrey hms surprise its final victory . i saw this movie theater three times , each occasion glimpsing something more , something different . addition film itself , collector edition includes fine documentary 19th century royal navy other " extras " . movie captain horatio hornblower ( 1952 ; gregory peck ) 8-part ae series , both based c.s. forester novels , superb their own way . however , i believe this film sine qua non naval dramas age sail	1
this film took me back time age 15 when only thing mattered how many friends you , how popular you , your status social pecking order . high school society most meaningless , inane , irrational , unproductive place world one . it almost better dead than go school every day , point agnes evidently concurred ( uh , no , she doesn't die ) ... this messed-up decadent reality modern world , where youth idle , nothing their time except obsess over shallow , hurtful social war-games . our society not engage young people helping solve today problems ; so , many problems ( like lost our manufacturing u.s.a. , or our export jobs careers , demise american middle class , environment ) simply not get fixed , people grow up callous uninterested solving social problems . this film indicts entire system education , which needs overturned revised ... i call two main characters " real " girls , contrast other girls this film , who not real , but phony , obsessed playing game getting into other people business . i not idealize lesbians particular , but extent they real willing buck social system themselves , they highly admirable . these two girls different personalities each other , it would really interesting see how their relationship progressed over time . but this movie first love ( lesbian ) , only involves initial stage , somewhere rejection acceptance . i won't tell you how movie ends , but it very moving highly recommended . i really feel agnes	1

ok , i'm only writing this because i wound up popping this dvd into my player last night watching it again . i bought this movie years ago after first seeing it laughing like imbecile pretty much throughout . yes , it sick humor . no , it not everyone . but this tom green ! i can't imagine what some people who reviewed this movie expecting - citizen kane ? c'mon people ! there precious little plot - just enough each tom green site gag or gross out gag , which basically what tom green known . letting him direct this film , i can't imagine what people thought they'd see ? most people i know not like this film , close friend mine still make fun me liking it , if i ever bring up title , but so what ? if lowbrow humor , sight gags gross out scenes make you chuckle , this film you . also , great acting , usual , rip torn - he hysterical . just remind yourself it tom green vehicle , you're only watching it lowbrow humor , you'll fine . if you sit down watch major movie production , yes , you'll disappointed but i don't think even close aim this movie . still ridiculously funny after all these years . baby scene , " backwards man " scene , sausage scene absolutely inane , yet priceless	1

i went see " touch zen " late seventies new york film festival . all seriousness it my greatest moviegoing experience all my years moviegoer . i guess it because whenever i saw classic film like " citizen kane " or " bicycle thief " or " godfather " or whatever , i prepared see something great . but i totally unprepared this . i never seen anything like it before . when hsu feng suddenly revealed her ability fight this awe-inspired power grace -- not mention bound like gazelle -- it hit me all beauty magic what movies . it knocked me out see woman warrior like this . since then course i've seen many films like this . " crouching tiger " quotes many films , but ang lee james schamus fans this one . but there also " matrix " ( shot where hsu feng revealed ceiling over door ) course , " house flying daggers " - scene bamboo forest totally ripped off film . course , countless hong kong films . this bible . i also believe painstaking beauty it leone-like compositions , it influenced new generation filmmakers like zhang yimou . other directors king hu time made four films year . he spent three years this . but thing remember " touch zen " completely before cgi . course there lot old-fashioned cinema trickery , but much it just plain old acrobatics . so i little afraid see what i would think it decades later . what made first time work how unexpected it . anyway , i popped copy , just check out how bad copy . i ended up watching whole three hours , finishing two am . i've seen so many other films like this since , but it still bes t.t he copy just like ones you see restoration videos , when they show you how brilliant color faded there all these scratches , etc . there version this film comes different company , it available amazon . uk , but you would need all-region player , which course illegal . it might end up same print anyway . there version i've seen cinflix.com no subtitles . one final note , i actually met king hu hollywood backlot eighties . he trying make hollywood film producers midge sanford sarah pillsbury ( " desperately seeking susan " ) i guess he little too early . i'm sure there would place him now , but he passed years ago	1

don't let this movie running time ( 325 minutes ; almost 4 hours ) , fact it not english , or it cricket , put off any potential viewers . this not action film , nor it high-suspense thriller . it doesn't any special effects , no blood , no gore . yet some reason , story catches you up you find yourself caring what happens . personally , i found four hours whizzed . i don't know more than couple words hindi , so i can't say how accurate subtitles , but they certainly good enough me informed . i especially appreciated subtitles musical numbers , which you rarely find . american , i find cricket rather mysterious . so i didn't understand finer details cricket match , but i definately got wrapped up tension suspense , even if i didn't know why . which , if you think it , good reccomendation ! acting great ; aamir khan very charismatic , intense , down right handsome . i appreciated gracy singh acting well ; she could really camped up her jealousy scenes , but instead came off adorable ; how could bhuvan ( kahn ) not love her ? i wonder how long it took british actors learn their hindi lines , or if they doing them phonetically . i digress . if you even passing interest india , indian history , bollywood style movies , or even peculiar game called cricket , then you enjoy this film immensely	1

there aren't many cases where movie better than book , but " goodbye mr. chips " one them . james hilton tossed together his barely over 100 pages big type week . scriptwriters film fleshed out good story line much more detail . well-directed just superbly acted robert donat title role , this film endearing classic . basic story traditional english schoolmaster , set period mid-victorian pre-wwii . it gentle tale meaning man life how we rise excellence our modest professions touch lives many . mr. chipping ( " chips " his students affectionately know him ) leads rich life , although also fraught sorrows . there still much relevance film -- tragedy war , importance balanced education , evils caste . yes , film sentimental little manipulative , but you probably not mind . fact , you may cry your eyes out . compared r.f. delderfield " serve them all my days , " book " chips " not nearly good , but this film tops bbc mini-series " days " virtually every way -- especially managing leave out lot class warfare ! order it , go buy box puffs , plonk yourself down delightful classic	1
this documentary written , directed edited ray greene features clips independent movies made 1950s 1960s height ( relatively speaking ) exploitation movies united states . clips , " schlock ! secret history american movies " interviews people who made these movies . you should recognize least some what whizzes here ( e.g. , " nude moon , " " carnival soul "" ) if you any familiarity genre you recognize lots names . just disappointed when one these movies catches your fancy then you discover it not available video or dvd . this 2001 documentary begins asking , " what exploitation movie ? " easy answer not forthcoming , but you certainly understand evolution genre over quarter-century which it thrived . greene finds genesis exploitation discovery teenagers comprised economic market distinct rather broad category " children . " i am not sure if i would privilege arrival vampira scene highly greene , but you admit she makes pretty good poster girl movies under discussion . actually , youth oriented films ( e.g. , " i teenage werewolf " ) get rather short shift " part i : fast furious , " although it introduce roger corman work a.i.p. explores idea there examples exploitation films might actually meaningful ( not their creators aware such depth ) . there also emphasis idea exploitation movies it how you sell these things matters more than whether or not they any good ( because they usually not ) . court rulings obscenity set up " part ii : sinema , " which most interesting part documentary because greene shows how industry got sex films dealing miracle birth " hygiene " issues , nudist camp films doris wishman , nudie cuties films harry novak . once exploitation films go " across great divide " part iii , we get emphasis blood gore impact sexploitation films we get what called roughies . so if you not interested sexploitation you going disappointed " schlock ! " because this where greene able make his best academic arguments . really . you only look so many naked women greene analysis interview clips wishman novak lot more interesting . final section returns corman see what he up 1960s looks how what happening end decade ratings system " midnight cowboy " ended up sounding death knell exploitation flicks . concluding argument today all movies examples exploitation , during end credits while we watch people walk poster " godzilla " ( " size matter " ) , which reinforces idea today all movies " exploitation " definition . it interesting see these filmmakers point out today movies their best days weeks when they open , which trademark exploitation films their heyday , versus way movies major studios would build momentum over time . terms dvd extra we begin behind scenes footage sexploiters harry novak ( takes us tour his office ) , dorish wishman ( interview outtakes ) , david . friedman ( demonstrating typical " sex hygiene " book pitch ) . then greene talks " sci-fi : science symbols " short clip television documentary we short , " atom eve , " surreal industrial film early 1960s produced connecticut yankee atomic power company , which uses buxom dancer leslie franzos sell nuclear power ( greene wryly notes card introducing this one , " obscenity eye beholder " ) . audio extras there kpcc radio interview greene , songs " your one only original lizard brain " " under rug , " latter johnny english , who wrote soundtrack music liked it enough add lyrics make it song . matter , you listen entire soundtrack . there exploitation art gallery ( most which pops up documentary ) , credits filmmakers also credits talking heads forrest . ackerman doris wishman ( which samuel . arkoff , peter bogdanovich , roger corman maila nurmi a.k.a. vampira ) . you also find audio commentary track greene , co-producer wade major special guests really continue explore topics broached documentary	1
this excellent dvd video collection . very good picture quality sounds . worth purchase it . not think twice	1
here italian cannibal movie i continue find there isn't much exciting this genre . again , we mostly controversy over killing animals which i really don't find either disturbing or entertaining all . i am also little bored seeing kerman movie . there really one scene where they could taken movie ' too far ' but they held back . i hoping they would take things too far .	1
i think biggest problem this movie people think they're supposed take it seriously . ummmm , no . it satirical comedy , not straight comedy . all indignant people who pan this movie saying it stupid taking it way too seriously . course it stupid , it satire . ( warning , some minor spoilers , but they don't matter much ) i mean , love interest nun , he mails himself vatican , he spends whole movie trying get cup capuccino his parole officer tries get him commit crime . think da vinci code meets laurel hardy .	1
jackie chan great even wild-wes t.t his movie just plain fun ! exactly what it meant ... not true western , not hilarious comedy , just plain fun	1
you know , this movie great . it some performances die , some most awkward dry humor out there , simultaneously hilariously funny deeply disturbing , relatable characters one either recognize or realize chillingly exist right next door ... or sometimes your very own house . it really great movie , especially utilizing todd solontz ' particular brand suburbia mentality . it just he didn't know where stop . mostly his relationships this film great , going surprising directions ultimately very telling type person he trying create . but honestly , we even need any side-story parents ? every time we got back them i got distinct feeling this five , ten , fifteen minutes i'd not watching other , better , more interesting characters develop . also , fat lady neighbor ; ultimately , her story came out end became worth it , but it most predictable least tightly defined all characters . i think todd solontz got little into " big cast " syndrome ( without actually hugely recognizable cast , save hoffman boyle ) express much widespread loneliness possible , but didn't think how much may weigh down otherwise biting in-your-face social commentary . it great movie , but it could even better . -- polarisdi	1
judging number reviews ( now 44 ) amazon , this 1943 western masterwork must relatively unknown . directed william wellman , starring henry fonda , dana andrews henry morgan , this tale mob ( posse ) rule frontier " justice " timeless , , unforgettable . film actually ensemble piece many fine performances . it should mentioned wellman cast black man prominent role preacher , which little unsual early 1940s . filmed bland silvery black white , absent here desolute beauty arizona desert or majesty colorado mountains , it appears movie made entirely studio backlot constructed sets . its great sense enclosure instrumental stark reality film inevitable conclusion . there very little action type normally associated westerns , but storyline so precise convincingly executed it moves quickly , almost too much so . say much more film content would giving too much away . film nominated academy award best picture wellman directed other great films , my favorite ( other than this one ) " battleground , " u.s. army struggle hold bastogne during battle bulge . " ox-bow incident " top my favorite westerns should staple any serious collector library	1

i'm not sure what i'm supposed expecting " classic eploitation/revenge " film , but if this it i'd say genre died just death . many reviewers pointed out , there simply fatal problems this film . sex scenes utterly awful , like they instructional film . christina lindberg beautiful , but don't expect any thrills her outside some decent lesbian scenes . lack music sound create claustrophobic feel , but this kind film i never tell if that intentional or just result piss-poor production values . " action " scenes almost all slow-motion which simply too slow robs scenes any sense real violence . i don't know why people go this kind movie . i think tarentino some sort complex : he feels guilty using kind production values he , while movies he grew up looked sounded like this one . he should get over it though , there nothing wrong movie looks sounds good , doesn't make you feel akward while you watch it . there little " rough " or " shocking " this movie , its just not very well . it interesting period piece , its cool i limited edition ( though it not numbered other reviewers pointed out ) , don't think this investment though , few more years , no one going care ...	1

comedy bitter sweet edge , " purple rose cario " fairly simple premise . cecilia ( mia farrow ) struggles make ends meet during great depression . her husband monk ( danny aiello)is lout who cheats her gambles since losing his job cecilia work restaurant take laundry meet their bills rent . only escape cecilia going movies -- fantasy world hollywood gives her coccoon brutal real world . her favorite movie " purple rose cario " featuring gil shepard ( jeff daniels ) tom baxter ( also jeff daniels dual role)changes her life when character tom baxter walks out movie into real world . he says he love her wants her happy something no one else except cecilia sister cares . rest characters film ( edward herrman , milo o'shea , deboarh rush , zoe caldwell , john wood , van johnson)are pretty upset end up sparing audience watching them screen when they complain how boring movie . " purple rose " one allen most complete films captures all wistfulness lurks background his films . this dvd looks extremely good considering transfer 2001 . there some minor artifacting particularly when characters move quickly screen but , whole , it not big deal . allen hasn't commentary tracks allowed extras his releases which too bad there cut footage viggo mortensen michael keaton ( who originally cast lead instead daniels)that would interest . i don't know if footage still exists but if it it would make lovely addition this . why mgm didn't choose include archieved footage allen talking film new interviews stars beyond me . this oscar nominated ( best screenplay)film certainly deserves documentary its making or , very least , featurette . we get original theatrical trailer booklet discusses making film . great movie hopefully get better treatment when it ends up blu-ray format , " purple rose " still treat well worth picking up . it also priced well $12-14 most retail outlets amazon.com	1

i love navy movies like this because i grew up hearing my grandfather stories life navy during ww2 . james caan plays sailor who required leave his ship because minor medical problem . because missing paperwork , however , he forced remain shore his beloved ship departs its latest voyage . although he stuck shore , he makes most his situation heads nearest bar!it bar he spots sexy marsha hunt , who known her sexual exploits sailors . after he hustles her pool game , they both leave bar head her apartment where he " collects " his payment ( you know what i mean ! ) . while there he discovers she young son ( kirk calloway ) who major attitude problem . despite boy attitude , caan starts spending more more his free time trying earn boy trust . he also realizes he falling love hunt . despite her initial protests , he tries his best help her change her lifestyle become better parent her troubled child ( who drinks alcohol chews tobacco ) . learning hunt pregnant man , caan bravely chooses marry her so she'll supported his navy benefits . her baby dies shortly after death , however , her depression drives them apart . caan must then choose returning navy or trying patch up their relationship . i won't spoil ending , although i must say i thought it rather unconvincing . i don't know why this called comedy video jacket , although there humorous scenes . some best scenes involve caan his former drill instructor ( eli wallach ) . way , i surprised discover glenn buttkus ( " sailor ward " ) small role this movie . if i'm not mistaken , that same glenn buttkus who fabulous movie lists amazon.com! while this movie isn't quite good " last detail " , i still highly recommend it .	1
while it would hard any movie top original matrix , this movie attempts so . some levels , it best matrix movie yet . it goes out bang . without ruining ending , i say it climactic experience , keeps you pinned your seat thirsty more every step way . this movie , well previous 2 , belong collections action fans everywhere	1
i remembered name theme movie but nothing else . i love espionage , mysteries , detective stories so i decided order it . it amazing see how far technalogy come since 40ths . every instrument they showed looked so ancient . fbi also different , good reputation it now .	1
this movie very difficult watch after awhile . its psycho boss but its not funny all . i didn't laugh through any movie . i love dark comedies like election , heathers , die , etc but this just didn't work me . i hated it so much i returned it ( lied said it gift ) . don't even rent it horrendous	1

whoever wrote editorial review sucks writing . also , this movie sucks	1
i gave two stars this movie exactly two benefits i gained watching it . these benefits illustrated next two paragraphs . there absolutely beautiful cinematography . depictions provence , region france adjacent both mediterranean sea italy , bountiful beautiful . director ridley scott showcasing scenes representing provence enough make one consider clicking " complete order " button 14-day european vacation extravaganza . catchy little tune alizee , " moi lolita " , made brief appearance movie which catapulted song back into my consciousness . song , course , one many attempts media capitalize cultural sensation vladimir nabokov controversial novel , " lolita " , but story entirely . * plot summation information below*the essence story tired clich� greedy , amoral pig finding meaning , love , purpose via simple equation : abandoned family estate + attractive native love interest + beautiful french countryside = happiness . max ( russell crowe ) wildly successful but unscrupulous power broker , who never met market he didn't want manipulate . following particularly successful business adventure , his assistant clues him possibility he risk investigated trade regulatory commission . partial solution , she his superiors recommend he take temporary leave absence company , preferably out country , until heat dies down . luck would it , max uncle recently died provence , since he left no , winery previously under his care automatically bequeathed max , he closest known relative . * end plot summation information*many complained sheer predictability plot , definitely negative aspect this film , but not necessarily terminal one . what kill my enjoyment film utterly nonsensical editing . scenes flash without any semblance explanation . cut conversation , seemingly no reason all , explain nothing , then cut next scene just one beginning soak up scenery . include several characters scenes without any actual suggested or implied reason their placement there . speed up action one or two semi-montage scenes vein physical-comedy film , no pre- or post-scene comedic introduction or resolution . finally , splice post- " fin " scene which could only described surreal . essence , this movie 200 mini-films spliced into one . least , that impression i got , it totally destroyed my suspension disbelief . there other negatives : lame stereotyping ( secretaries , americans , european humor ) , plots go nowhere ( " good " / " bad " wine secret " conspiracy " ) , humor attempts which only labeled " wince-inducing " , among many , many other detrimental attributes . not even worth renting , unless your friend already rented it , you cleaned all gunk you could reasonably expected clean out your fingernails already . romantic comedy lovers : this neither romantic nor funny , so if you just see handsome russell crowe or beautiful marion cotillard , buy poster instead . " gladiator " or " black hawk down " fans : no , even breakneck editing , it still not action movie . scenery fans : turn off audio , fast-forward " scenery " scenes , keep semillon flowing ... i would recommend three bottles per person	1
this one my favorite thriller/suspense category . if you fan this type movie , then this must . it keep you edge your seat , you not want pause this one	1
director anthony mann star james stewart made great combination . i always found their westerns together reached part me other westerns didn't reach . bend river , winchester ' 73 etc , this top-notch stuff , not necessarily heavy action , but lot hear t.t he rest really great cast includes donald crisp , arthur kennedy aline macmahon	1
i bought this movie because i remembered it fondly when i 14 year old teenage girl back 1978 . my husband never seen it we couldn't find copy video store . i told my 15 year old daughter it since she big fan beatles , she interested seeing it well . when i received dvd , i sort cringed how cheesy movie . peter frampton barry gibb looked like hotties i remembered when i 14 , but movie whole pretty campy . before viewing movie , i concerned my daughter watching it , i remembered scene where band all getting drunk stoned , but compared what kids watch nowadays , or see myspace , it pretty tame . not surprisingly , though , my 15 year old daughter loved it . she plays it all time her friends over watch . she asked me who sings " come together " i told her it steven tyler band aerosmith . she thinks he hot ! i broke news her he 30 years older now . she still loves movie . i purchased soundtrack well . this movie album my first exposure many beatle songs i never heard kid . it made me want go out there hear original songs . some them , i like beatles version better , but i fell love peter frampton version " golden slumbers . " this movie great trip down memory lane me	1
