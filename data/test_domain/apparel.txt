these shoes durable , comfortable , most importantly come different widths . most other athletic shoe manufacturers apprarently don't make anything but width . new balance . those you complaining width , my guess if you size your feet correctly , problem go away . i always worn 12d width , until some gentleman mom pop store sized my feet correctly first time my life i found out i need 13b . you may think you know your feet , but you may not . comfort , i can't complain . durability , maybe they little stiffer , but if what extends life these shoes over others , well worth it my book	1

i am technically 32jj ( per some lingerie store lady ) , but worn 34 dd ddd since high school ( i'm 27 now ) hunt good nursing bra ( 33 weeks pregnant today ) . i tried " medela seamless underwire full fit nursing bra " 34g 34h . this one most supportive , but underwire ( which after 8 hours , i can't wait take off - i've always committed underwire wearer ) cup fits , but i'm nervous if it fit once my milk really comes . i also tried " fancee free foam support soft cup nursing bra , " which i also got 34g 34h not most supportive , but comfortable ( i wear this one bed , around house , etc . ) . so , regarding goddess bra - i just got 34g yes , cups little big , which i'm so thankful because certainly allow some growth they aren't so big my breasts look silly through shirts . not mention , cup part looser mostly around nipple ( i've instructed begin wearing nipple shield , so it allows room so-not-inconspicuous item ) . my favorite part back portion , which stretchy cotton not dig into my ribs end day like others . it also pretty supportive , maybe 9 out 10 supportiveness compared medela - but steps above fancee free . i likely buy one more this style - call it day buying nursing bras because i finally found what i'm looking . i'd recommend buying one cup size below what you normally wear if you're looking wear it right now you may wear size up after milk comes . this bra really got me excited - enough after 4 years ordering amazon , this first review i ever compelled write . hope you find same success this bra , too . good luck	1
i found these shorts run little bit small size so make sure you give yourself extra size up make sure there adequate room move freely . follow care label first wash or two until they get broke because shorts bit stiff first due their scotchgaurding . tip : make sure you wash them before you wear them . i would recommend these shorts most anyone who looking durability , comfort , and/or needing professional look garments they wear . note : if you looking extra pockets go dickies cargo route . these not any extra pockets	1

oh my goodness ... i don't know what i would without my spanx ! i never wear pair work slacks without them . nice pair trousers some polyester involved it ... well this stuff clings bulges panty lines . spanx gets rid vpl smoothes out those little areas we don't like mention . so fabrics little more flow them , actually flow not cling ! you look more neat tidy your clothes you might even look few pounds lighter . they so comfortable because it thin nylon material , you wear them during warm summer months . don't fooled imitations ! spanx brand only one you want when it comes quality doing what it promises ! i recommend medium control even if you little bit tummy hide ( it still works well me ) . super tends little tighter so size up if you going get them	1

i really like this travel clock ~ lightweight , sturdy , compact even tells temperature ! i really like it displays alarm clock time also - shows whether or not alarm function ... even shows when it snooze ~ snooze 4-5 minutes , there indiglo light bar - which same snooze bar located across top clock - very convenient easy find ! clock alarm very easy set you go up or down so you don't scroll through whole sequence get back your time ... setting hour minutes separately . all buttons beep when pressed - even light/snooze button - but minimal compared all great features conveniences ~ it quick beep much less loud than others i tried ( less beeping you hold down button automatic scrolling when setting time ) . i highly recommend this travel clock ! enjoy your travels	1

i purchased six these chairs august myself my friends before start college football season tailgaiting . they all made this manufacturer ( north pole ) different nfl logos them ( i only bought one through amazon , others bought through different companies due availability issues ) . first game season , my chair ( steelers ) broke . second game season , two more chairs ( bengals broncos ) broke . they not misused no weight limits exceeded . they all broke same exact place ; plastic pieces base legs all cracked . therefore , 3 out 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours . needless say , $25-$30 each i would recommend prospective buyers spend their money elsewhere	-1

i first purchased this bra specialty bra boutique 139.00 ca . i know it lot bra , but i too happy i found bra fit great . up until day i wore 36d or 36dd , after getting fitted i am now 32 . you understand i hate shopping bras , i never found right one always walk out store thinking i should get breast reduction . this bra one oprah wears loves . now it my favourite thing . i agree other customers it not prettiest bra if you bigger chested gal like my self , but you forget when you put t-shirt or blouse , because you really look 10 pounds thinner around waist you chest where it should . if you bigger chested gal , i would suggest before buying this bra , if you not too sure what size you , go get fitted proper store .... specialty store . most stores only sell bras a-dd cup , why you should go specialty store , sales women know lot more	1
i many different types sandals , but never owned pair birkenstocks . i think price what kept me buying them always gotten sandals without reguard who makes them long they $20 range . after my last pair fell apart i decided spend extra money birkenstocks . i am glad i . you tell how well made they right out box . they extremely comfortable wear , footbed firm but soft . longer you wear them more comfortable they get . i like birkibuc material better than leather it seems more water resistant . arch solid just right spot proper support . part where strap attached sole seamless very well . i am very happy purchasing sandals i recommend them highly . your feet won't hurt wearing them all day like some sandals or flip flops . one thing watch out , it says size measures true but first pair i ordered much too big i send them back smaller pair . i used conversion chart seller , but you may want order half or full size smaller than you normally would . ones i now size 41 supposed size 8 us , but i am true size 9 these fit me room spare .	1

we ordered nightgown size 6 my 4 1/2 year old daughter . she bit tall side we wanted nightgown last while . nightgown itself no problems - contstruction seems sturdy , no visible flaws , good printing , even if it little darker side . she claims " ariel my favorite princess " , so there no way it wasn't going hit her . slippers came nightgown too small size 6 . they didn't even fit my three year old who wears size 8 . i'm guessing these slippers around size 6 . i would thought they would sized slippers size nightgown , but now i suspect they make them " one size fits all " ( aka " one size too small " ) . besides too small , there nothing pull up over heel , so they constantly slip off foot . they discarded after 15 minutes when my two daughters realized they looked like more fun than they actually . tiarra obviously cheaply made . we weren't expecting any more than . my 4 1/2 year old left it ground first evening she got it accidentally stepped it breaking it cleanly half . honestly , i relieved i could get rid it quickly . i'm giving product 4 stars because what we really buying nightgown . lack 5 stars due poor construction sizing slippers - they could better job . tiarra non-issue us	-1

tutto ok per venditore prodotto . la spedizione internazionale dovrebbe comprendere il corriere espresso . la posta normale tende ad abbandonare l'articolo sulla porta di casa con il rischio di un furto da parte di un malintenzionato . inoltre i tempi di consegna troppo lunghi non permettono di pianificare eventuali regali . ho acquistato l'articolo per regalarlo mia moglie , ma purtroppo � arrivato dopo san valentino ... sigh	-1

look what i found ? where ? under there ! under wear ? ... right there ! it says , " first person write review " jockey boxer briefs . hmmmm ... no wonder no one reviewed these yet -- who writes review men underwear ? ok , fine , i'll it . i love these , my preferred brand style . your brand your style may vary this category apparel tends personal preference item . i only buy these black i am firm believer underwear ( men especially ) should not white -- time end day rolls around it time change them -- it better left wondering what might there opposed seeing it so prominently displayed white background ! these hold up well price . nothing lasts forever . elastic band usually first go ( after many repeated washings ) before material gives out . i.e. they fall off before they rot off . finally , so i feel like i complete job reviewing these , i buddy mine help ultimate test - weggie test - these shorts handled it well ... extreme pain reached well before structure and/or material boxer short failed . i give these " ten tippy toes " rating how well they performed test .	1

this truly beautiful bag ! i got classic dark leather , which exactly rich brown shown pictures . leather wonderful grain adds bag character . leather thicker than i expected ; while it no means stiff , it not ultra-soft , ultra-thin butter leather . this leather age well last many , many years . zippers matte silver metal so not only they look great against brown leather , they'll durable . ( other hardware same type matte/antiqued silver . ) bag lined heavy khaki twill just shade or two lighter than strap . cotton strap not only adds bag uniqueness , it also keeps bag sliding when you bend over . ( i wear it across my chest like messenger bag . ) inside there two small pockets divider separating two sections bag . one gusseted works well cell phone ( or items similar size ) other suitable only small flat items such business cards ; i would really liked my ipod snuggle second pocket but something thick won't fit . internal sections bag large enough hold notebook , file or book but bag smaller than most other messenger bags i've tried because they sized laptops . i actually use it purse it plenty room all my junk ubiquitous book . outside , each end bag pocket vertical row stitching bisecting it . this creates 2 tall , thin pockets where i keep pens ; it would nice if one side didn't row stitching so it could hold larger items , but that not problem me . entire back side bag zippered pocket . front flap small zippered pocket turns out good home cell phone because you get it quickly without going into bag . magnetic closure flap sufficiently strong . there 2 magnets body bag flap there metal bar running width flap so you don't worry lining up magnets close bag . i've bag only few days already received compliments . though bag pricey , it obviously crafted care high-quality materials . it also very distinctive look . i am very happy this purchase already added diongini bag my amazon wish list	1

i am huge fan under armour workout apparel , addition owning several these tech t-shirts , also own several each loose gear shirts ( 0084 ) heat gear compression shirts ( 0039 ) - i've written reviews those well . tech t-shirt ( 0382 ) feels really good your skin - like your favorite , most comfortable old cotton t-shirt . it looks just like cotton matte finish - it not shiny/silky like loose gear shirts or heat gear compression shirts . it very soft , comfortable lightweight , i love this shirt both working out casual wear . shirt runs true size ( buy your regular t-shirt size it fit really well ) , roomiest cut under armour shirts . i absolutely love raglan sleeves tech tee - one features makes them so comfortable gives them little bit unique look . tech tee small amount lycra-like fabric polyester microfiber , which gives it quite bit stretch . i like this because shirt doesn't bind if you're doing something really requires you reach or stretch - certain weight exercises , aerobics , yoga , etc . shirt works way it supposed , wicks moisture your skin rapid evaporation . tech tee available numerous colors ( i 6 them ) spite fact fabric thin lightweight , shirts very opaque . shirts nice cut look great over jeans or shorts - addition gym , i often wear them out around , or when working yard . they super comfortable worn undershirt too , but probably little costly . like all under armour shirts , they self-material neck band , but it fits just right says place , even if you get sweaty - it doesn't sag like cotton ones . while i zero complaints tech tee , aware it under armour " budget " product , if there such thing . material start pill after few washings - this affects appearance slightly , but not performance or fit . although i haven't worn out any my under armour shirts yet , i'm going venture tech t-shirt won't quite durable their signature loose gear shirts heat gear compression shirts , nor it perform quite well . other hand it , it 20% cheaper , so anything else , you get what you pay . when stacked up against ua other shirts , i'd say tech tee you if : 1 ) you like look feel soft , cotton t-shirt but want wicking performance microfiber shirt . 2 ) you don't care shiny , silky , more synthetic look feel loose gear shirts , or tightness heatgear compression shirt . 3 ) you want shirt that little roomier . 4 ) you want shirt stretch it . 5 ) you want save little $$ but still wear authentic ua logo shirt	1

i really not believe this item would work . i lit " three match ordered three prove it . i still can't believe just how well it worked just perfectly promised . where this product all my life ! i just happened " stumble " over it looking ties . thanks foryour great product placement . i promise anyone reading this one thing : you not find better value your money anywhere internet	1
yoga mats come three basic thicknesses . 1/8 " this mat average thickness . mats half thick this one good travel or placing under thicker mat provide more traction . thick mats ( 3/16 " ) 50% thicker than this one designed those who need or want extra cushion . 24 " 68 " it average length width . these mats really beautiful ! professional , i'm normally not concerned look mat ; it performance ease use primary concern . however , these mats stunning ! you'll definitely get oohs aahs your fellow yoga enthusiasts when you roll these out . blue one looks like ocean orange looks like liquid lava ! i especially love how design goes all way through mat isn't just ' printed ' one side . design your mat last long your mat . there two sides this nearly all yoga mats . look carefully ' bumps ' each side mat . larger bumps designed face upwards cushion your hands , feet , knees during poses while keeping your body dangerously slipping out alignment . smaller bumps designed face downwards grip floor keep yoga mat sliding . many mats label one end name brand . this typically , but not always , located ' up ' side . bumps tell you sure . this yoga mat increase softness stickiness use . ( so most mats . ) they start out mildly sticky increase stickiness more they used . you want wash your mat when it first arrives so remove thin film they get their surface during manufacturing process . instructions washing mat included . once you've washed dried your mat you're ready begin ! after using it while , if you find mat decreasing stickiness each time you pull it out , this typical sign light coating dust or too much body sweat accumulated your mat it needs light hand washing very diluted soap water . after washing , roll your mat thick towel squeeze out excess water , otherwise it take forever dry air . then , air dry your mat unrolled , inside , away sunlight . ( hanging over shower bar works nicely . ) when you first unroll your mat you find one end bit curled . simply alternate direction you roll your mat ( top outside once , then bottom outside next ) or end you start ( curled end once , flat end next time ) you'll find it straightening out more or less over time . i recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them you . i've worked many studios gyms over years . sometimes management mats cleaned often , sometimes not . if you bring your own mat you always know where it . :o ) plus , owning your own mat may encourage you begin valuable practice home . my students who trouble their knees some poses requiring body weight rest knee , i recommend temporarily folding over one end mat get double cushion under knee while still leaving one layer under rest body . this saves you haul more than one mat out each time you practice which discouraging especially beginner .	1

i purchased boston clog summer 2000 , worn it every year since then , am happy report it still most comfortable shoe i possess . since many other reviews here praised its comfort , i briefly pass over few problems probably occur over long-term wear . first , after year wear , outsole began detach itself rest clog . this easily fixed some shoe glue i purchased shoe store . since applying it 2001 or so , i not any further problems outsole coming off . second , mentioned one review , part outsole where your foot hits ground most often wear out fastest . this expected . nevertheless , after close seven year worth wear , outsole still holding up quite well , heel only place where there no grip pattern left . still , plenty outsole remains . finally , year ago leather lining footbed started detach itself cork underneath heel . again , any good adhesive solve problem . this time i used super glue -- problem solved . overall , leather reflects seven year worth use , but it still holding up very well , both footbed , entire upper part . all things considered , i worn lot shoes past seven years , many them overpriced european brands fabled comfort ( ecco , camper , clarks ) but boston clog outlasted all them terms durability comfort . i highly recommend this quality shoe	1

amazon notes these socks " only made finest yarns . " they mean it , too ! these socks keep your feet warm ; they very well made last forever . these athletic crew socks worn athletic activities but course they could worn everyday routine use well . addition , they made 85% gold toe " ultrabrite " acrylic 15% stretch nylon . amazon states acrylic gives these socks " wickability " but this word may typographical error ; i could not find entry word " wickability " dictionary . price right , too . these crew length socks also fit any shoe size 7 12 ; therefore it -- almost -- one size fits all . reinforced heel toe makes them last longer they still feel very comfortable my feet . sock itself comes white ; but toe area literally made gold colored fibers . i would not dry these socks high temperatures . this could result sock becoming too loose your foot . eventually they could " bunch up " when you wear them that very uncomfortable . dry these fine socks lower temperature . then they remain just comfortable ever . i know mine ! overall , you can't go wrong buying these socks . they keep your feet extra warm during colder weather . they manufactured so well you definitely get more than your money worth . good deal ! smile	1

these light ( weight ) hikers slip-on shoe appears lace-up ( thus , " chameleon " ) . i put these things test extended hiking chores come day end sore back , legs , etc - but feet feeling fine ready more . sounds like baloney but it not . i cannot overstate how pleased i mine . great traction they show essentially no wear thus far . it scares me think what it take wear these things out . i didn't buy them looks , but i've several compliments them . some additional observations -- there essentially no break period . you hit it hard them right out box they'll treat your feet well . although slip-on , due their substantial construction , they not pull all easily . you use handy heel tab provided give pretty good tug . they look kind like running shoe ( " chameleon effect " again ) i gave them go two mile jog . big mistake . i might well wearing steel-toe engineer boots . these things substantial heel element concealed shoe they felt like they weighed ton . they not cross-trainers not suited running shoe . i fully recommend these situations where one their feet all day casual/sports appearing shoe appropriate . worth price	1

i've trying find decent bra ages : one would attractive * * hold things place same time . i afraid i'd doomed old 1950s bulletproof , cone-shaped bra-in-a-box styles forever ... those anything but seductive . ( i recently changed bra sizes one stores carried multiple styles/selections 34ddd , which you order online or made- astronomical prices . ) i hopeful this bra , because it decently priced ~ ~ i wasn't disappointed . underwire 4 hooks give excellent hold , cups deep enough cover everything ( keep things pointing up where they belong ) , criss-cross lacing cups gives it just enough peek-a-boo allure make it sexy . even though this bra sedate white , it still passed husband whistle-test . :) not bad !	1

i've using gt-2000 series shoes 2+ years now , i honestly say , they're most comfortable running shoes my build . this one asics best , if not best , selling shoes because it offers such wide variety fit most foot types . these shoes mainly designed moderate heavy over-pronator ( when feet roll too much ) low medium arches , but i've met fellow runners same shoe who medium high arches . i , myself , am flat-footed , but use orthotics . this major problem me when buying shoes because i need something wide enough heel allow my orthotics fit , these work great . don't worry if you don't wide heel because there memory foam embedded heel forms your foot over time . heel forefoot also offer good amount stability support . shoe designed medium large builds , but again , i've come across other runners who much lighter use same shoe . when i first began running , i weighed 300+ pounds , now 216 pounds , shoes still work well ( i've bought newer version this shoe i've worn others out ) . " upper " ( top parts shoe ) really comfortable . it made mesh material allows maximum amount air circulation into foot , while allowing all heat , moisture sweat out . shoe so comfortable , you could easily run it without socks ( which i only few times ) . 2000 series versatile , they're well priced , they come variety sizes , widths , colors , so chances they'll fit you . this far best running shoe i've used up date , would recommend it anyone who just starting or long time runner .	1

i very disappointed this rain suit . i bought it , especially after seeing above review , since i too bicycle commute . i'm not sure if they sent me different rain suit or what , but one i got didn't overall pants . i bike hour each way , after first ride , pants holes around bicycle seat area material breaking down other points pants well . jacket immediately started coming away bottom snap . ( definitely not " rugged " suit ! ) i didn't problem too hot , although perhaps because this springtime new england . i wouldn't bother buying this suit unless your commute quite short .	-1
i love these boots so much i bought them every color leather type available ! they very comfortable yet stylish enough wear dresses skirts . i hate pointed toe shoes worried these might prove too narrow , but toe area only gently pointed so they feel fit fine . also , i fairly wide foot typically wear clogs socks , but these again worked well me . leather soft i assume give little over time which just means slightly thicker sock my huge stash . also , there minimal padding so sock helps cushioning . sometimes i unfold flap make boots bit taller . i only wish they version truly came just below knee . i'd buy every color , too	1
if you really follow direction how wash it then should not question . i promptly remove it dryer or hang dry . it dries out very fast job it promises . " those who can't dance should not dance all	1
i purchased last years model at202 ( not pretty , but same functionally ) took it my trip peru 4 weeks . bag huge it well separated so you divide your things exceptionally well . it wheeled , carried ( top handles ) or hefted your back . i put bag heavily loaded my back carried it 3 blocks cusco . while it wasn't most comfortable carry - it allowed me move faster more easily . one thing i concerned older bag zippers . one point teeth not meshing either top or bottom sections i worried they ruined . but i simply ran both zippers same end ( using small force ) teeth seemed fixed . i really love this bag use it often all my travels , so potential zipper problem only thing i mention . i highly recommend bag	1
i just received these shoes today here my impressions . 3:30 pm shoes arrived i eagerly opened box put them . they feel quite bit different other shoes . sole very springy ! tongue hurting my right foot i'm concerned i am going need return shoes . 4:30 pm i take shoes off it turns out tongue ( which connected sides top shoe where laces go through)is not centered quite right so i fold it place put shoes back . i notice difference instantly . my wife comes home work says " i don't like way they look .... but they your shoes " . 5:30 i don't care how they look because they soooo comfortable . soft leather uppers seems fit foot perfectly soft sole still really springy . combination these two magnificent . 7pm i love these shoes so much i am sitting computer writing review amazon ! i generally wear birkenstock dr. marten shoes so i spoiled my feet . it fantastice surprise get these shoes find they even more comfortable than docs or birks . i just ordered pair desert treks ....	1

we bought these shoes my 3yo daughter august . she wears them every day they still look great . ( but i admit she not really hard her shoes . she usually outgrows them before she outwears them . ) here just some reasons why i'll probably buy her new pair when she outgrows her current pair : -everyone comments how cute they tires , chassis , flashing lights . -they're easy her put take off herself . -no one noticed or commented my daughter wearing " boy " shoe . -the dark color helps hide dirt scuff marks . these great shoes any cars fan ... whether you boy or girl . i only wish they came grown up sizes !	1

i bought my first pair berks qvc i loved them . i wore them many places i could because comfort , i simply refused change shoes . only thing shoe ran over quicker than i anticipated so i buy three more pair . heel not last long walking or running shoe esprit --- only draw back . since inside shoe molds your feet , it reflect your shoe size if you lose or gain too much weight . when i lost weight after my baby , i lost weight my feet well i start wearing bulky soxs my berks instead stocking . when i first tried my berks , they little tight slightly uncomfortable but after walking around them two days it loosen up molded my feet , ----- once happened they very comfortable then . thing i love it my sister cannot borrow my berks because she says they don't fit her right they uncomfortable . we wear same size shoe give or take few minor width inches here there , but because berks molded my feet imprint my walking pattern she can't wear them comfortable . yes , yes , i love little feature .	1
