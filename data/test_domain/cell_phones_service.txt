i recently purchased this bluetooth scala-500 used it all maybe 5 times . why such short amount time ? because sound quality heard other end so poor i am told it sounds like i am windy tunnel when fact i am car windows up radio off . it bit too hot drive air condition off windows up just so person other end hear me . now i keep this piece junk my console only use it if my logitech bluetooth out power . if you buy this make sure you plan use it place like library where there no sounds all interfere . only good thing this headset it easy setup connects well my cell phone . think twice buying this product or check it out your local retailer first . even rebate i only paid $[ ... ] , but still not bargain . one star ease setting up my cell phone	-1
samsung great phone black jack . unfortunately , headset jack not standard jack , but instead one unique samsung phones . therefore , you forced buy samsung headset . bottom line -- don't bother . design horrible . earbuds don't stay ear . what makes matters worse each ear bud rigid teardrop inch half connects cord . any pressure or movement teardrop say clothing or hair pushes ear bud out your ear . i hope samsung creates adapter fit jack allow you use regular headphones .	-1

basic phone , slice rates ok . i only few minor complaints . 1 ) when headset attached phone not ring through external speaker . so if you not wearing headset when call comes . call missed . 2 ) there no option use vibrate ring same time . it vibrate or it ring . 3 ) battery life not good stated . standby phone runs out power after six hours . 4 ) text messaging there no reply option . reply text you start new message then search sender original message . 5 ) ring tones come phone horrible . aside those few problems i quite satisfied phone	1

works fine . difficult connect but connects securely . comes unlabeled cd ( couldn't tell one side other ) great selection ringtones wallpapers , though tones aren't labeled any helpful way . i impressed . it also links any 1st party software you need though i'm sure google search would just easy	1
this battery performs expected . it standard palm battery - meaning it probably underpowered relative power consumption device . note also when using bluetooth and/or blackberry rim email service battery life notably reduced . solution would lower device consumption , or bigger capacity battery - neither which appear possible moment . so my solution second spare battery	1
got it day later basically ordered around 10 pm got it around today so great shipping it works great , drivers work everything ! awesome deal 3 bucks :	1
i it since october it clearly best phone i ever owned . it also replaced my camera , i am now never without camera . i attend lot concerts where cameras almost always prohibited . they don't give phone second glance , not realizing it got 3.2 megapixel capability . i got tons fantastic shots last 4 shows . after throwing 1gb memory stick ( i think it $79 ? ) it now storing half gig my best music display says it hold 300+ pics right now . movie function rocks too , however you going want up very close subject . sound playback movies fantastic though , so least concert videos make good listening . phone works flawlessly my pc . if i throw it usb cable , it pops up instantly drive , just like camera . just drag on/off music pics . all pics very nicely numbered named . if i don't care viewing files just want move stuff off phone , i don't even take it out my pocket . bluetooth connection allows me use their software move things around . also very cool it pops up my computer modem , which i actually able use immediately my pc anywhere program . terms phone , yeah it great . contact list easy work , call clarity no issue all , good signal , no dropped calls , etc . etc . ( this all cingular ) . speaker phone works well . it needs charging every 3rd day , charges very quickly . charges slower but usb plugged it also charges . only thing i think complain when using usb cable charge , it only wants charge it 89% . if i want 100% i throw it real charger few minutes .	1
overall i'm happy skin . it fits treo 700 very closely . this custom formed every curve , bump , button treo . my one complaint they advertise it compatible 700w 700p . i should paid more attention pictures thought it . 700w , if you don't know , almost identical except buttons just below screen . button layout same , but they different icons purposes . well , skin images button covers 700w , not 700p . not huge deal , just slight annoyance . i'm going see if there way remove these somehow	1

i owned palm organizers since days original palm pilot loved them ( i think i three different models over years ) . i wanted smart phone so i could check my email so i gravitated treo 680 so i could stay palm product so i could stay my current mobile provider , cingular . now i am counting days until my 2 year commitment ends so i punt this awful , awful product . i may even bite bullet pay off my commitment early just so i get rid i t.t he battery problem huge . you must remember stick this charger whenever you . if you forget leave it your pocket overnight then it dead next day . i turned off every thing i find sucks power it still drains amazingly fast . it won't even last day if you make very many calls . reception terrible . i've cingular phone long time able get good reception over most so . california ( except my house course ) . this phone i think you right underneath antenna get signal . i conference call yesterday got dropped twice . i am envious everytime i get elevator someone who talk their cell phone because mine freeze up any time i try . yes , it freezes up often . only way i found unfreeze it take out battery let it hard reboo t.t he versa mail program it came cingular hard work . you must leave your work computer check corporate mail . means if i am traveling my computer , phone corporate mail program not work . it often not sync anyway . i don't think browser comes phone work java , so i cannot check my yahoo mail either . i tried going back forth pre-java version yahoo too much pain . i get all kinds weird messages phone . i haven't ever able sync up palm features because some legacy files my previus palm software , something never happened when i upgraded before . yes , there manual huge . it hard use line so i guess i need bite bullet print out whole thing then take week vacation read it see if i make any these neat functions i read work . hardly week goes i don't actively think how much i hate this phone . i actually signed amazon today just write this because phone wasn't working properly today . what piece junk !	-1
so i bought this thing based amazon reviews saved bundle over local retail cost ( yeah amazon ! ) , but that not why i'm writing this review . i'd like talk performance comfort earboom . eargel thingies designed quite well , three different sizes each ear you're bound find one fits very comfortably . turns out i couldn't find any fit my right ear comfortably extended periods use but found perfect fit my mate other side . my wife exact opposite experience - hopefully our daughter inherit more symmetrical ears ! i hate jogging so can't comment fit during activity but say gels fit suprising well folds your ear boom quite secure when installed . i'd imagine it'd take big hit knock it loose once place . sound quality earbud decent , but i feel earboom lacks some fidelity , especially higher frequencies . normally this not problem , but it sometimes make person you're talking sound like isaac hayes . speaker plently loud lack high frequencies allows you tune into tonal range where us humans tend converse , without voices washed over background noise . gels block appropriate amount external sounds allowing you concentrate discussion hand without impeding your ability hear say ambulance while driving . there small slot gels funnels some external noise your drum , while rest gel fits snug ear blocking out other stray noise paths . i've asked people how i sound thus far feedback positive , my voice comes through loud clear despite boom apparent lack length , reinforcing my belief size doesn't matter . fact , i found mic very sensitive even small sounds . forget talking phone subtly typing keyboard our mouse click surfing - they'll hear every click . example , i my house person other end could hear kids playing pool 40 feet away house windows closed !! yes , mic sensitive . even while driving they could hear when i shifted gears . not it obtrusive other person phone , it just good aware they hear it all . what more say such simple device . form fit function all there i would recommend this product . fact , i just ordered - it makes great gift	-1
every new gadget imaginable i must report i love this phone because i take pictures make videos ! i loathe charge battery everyday ! perhaps i just got bad battery but i've never charge any phone daily . keep mind i leave my phone 24/7 . maybe i should turn it off . anyone else this same syndrome ? if you're shutterbug like me , you love this phone . i didn't even mention hot pink/magenta color which all gals love . one note caution , if you live hurricane alley like me , you may want carry spare battery just case they don't take down cell phone towers before storm . it may useless locally but you least tell your people you're still among living need money escape carnage	-1

i just purchased this phone four days ago impressed it most part . first thing you'll notice how crisp clear screen . this slider phone , thankfully you most things without sliding screen expose number keys . only things i think thus far requires you expose keys dial new number that not your contacts text message . next , we go features . so we got 1.3 mp camera , camcorder , music player , 1gb microsd card , bluetooth support , infrared port .. * drumroll please * fm radio . now , fm radio isn't satellite based , so you cannot pick up radio stations across u.s. , just those stations local you . now i go into good bad things each feature : 1 . camera - impressive picture quality . yes it only 1.3 mp compared those 8mp digital cameras , but you show me camera what this phone ? 5/52 . camcorder - not all impressive . while you recording , quality seems perfect . however , once you play it , it turns bit distorted . plus , it only allows 20 seconds recording time regardless size your microsd card . 3/53 . music player - impressive . speaker good quality , very loud . however , i still could not find way change order songs without making playlist . there play , pause , next song , previous song , fast forward , rewind features buttons shown pictures . buttons must pressed fairly hard , so your music won't start playing spontaneously your pocket . also , i blown away how quality music improves once you put those stock earbuds . 4/54 . fm radio - i bet those this phone tried use radio but stopped short told you buy enhancement . well , truth you don't need buy anything extra . just plug earbuds came phone , this serve ' antenna ' allow you hear stations . since you need earbuds hear radio , yes sound go earbuds . however , there ' loudspeaker ' option allows radio played through external speaker , but you still need keep earbuds plugged , it serves ' antenna ' . this means if you want hear radio your phone , you need earbuds you . you may need play around position phone antenna ( or you may move ) order get clear reception . 3/5misc . info : only two games included , both trials . ( lumines , texas hold'em)you can't transfer games phone . you must pay download them again . you can't delete pre-created profiles ( those come phone ) . you just create your own . order change phone vibrate , you must make vibrating profile . then use it , it takes several steps , which not hard , but inconvenient . interface shows month date , but not day week . only two face templates included phone . that all now . overall : 4/	-1
wow , i absolutely no problems this headset whatsoever . clear sound-great range-and most all its gorgeous . turns heads all over place . man i feel high tech this thing . i payed $30.00 off ebay , but rare deal . still amazons price cannot beat . buy it , youll love it	1

this phone also sold dopod 838 pro asia ( it quite popular singapore ) , htc tytn europe , but unlocked model . quite bit more expensive than what cingular sells it here . if you using this your first pda phone non windows product , you think it heavy , over feature laden product you never fully use , its problematic one . said , this probably one best windows pda phones available today . features this phone ( 3.5 , bluetooth 2.0 , etc . ) such you would never need bring laptop you . you even install skype mobile this phone . keyboard stows away well , good feel . there initial problems this phone asian market , now since resolved , now robust reliable . but one caveat keep mind when using this product ... it runs windows mobile . meaning , if you not familiar windows devices , it may frustrate you ... it doesn't respond like non windows cell phone . but , if you overlook , it perform better than anything available ... even blackberry devices not compare this	1

pros : fits phone very snuggly . made interesting flexible material fells like rubbery neoprene like polymer . all buttons phone accessible through case . belt clip sturdy removable so you wear phone your belt easily remove reinstall it belt clip without taking belt clip off your waist . cons : you cannot access keyboard without removing phone case . clear plastic screen covers phone screen little far surface phone screen . this makes it more difficult press buttons phone screen stylus near corners screen . clear plastic screen protector may stretch use make this easier but i'm not sure . positive side , you easily cut out clear plastic screen still use case some extra stick screen protectors found online .	-1
i've 3 cell phones prior this one , all motorola i really thought they all pretty good phones ... however i recently just made switch my new se k790a this one blows them all out water ! it very compact durable you tell it made incredible level quality control . i don't think i'll ever go back motorola . camera great feature . this why i bought phone , now i am never without camera . flash good strong , so it takes great pictures good focus . i don't really use mp3 feature because i ipod . i not comment this feature . however i very disappointed it wouldn't allow me use mp3s ringtones . i heard this because my service provider jackass not phone fault though . little bit forum browsing i able hack my way around this ( if you this problem email me skibum2801@yahoo.com ) ... now i my very own custom ringtones come out clear day nice speaker . call clarity much better than my other phones . i feel if i'm simply using my home phone it so grea t.t he screen resolution absolutely beautiful . buttons took little bit get used ( because i motorola girl so long ) but i picked it up quickly now i no issues .

first , let me say i really wanted like this device . i patience understanding while but it got me nowhere . main issue this phone its operating system : windows mobile 5.0 . this os piece fluff garbage . simple things should take click or two become so difficult access you basically just give up . main gripes ----------- connectivity t-mobile horrible : accessing aim function doesn't work 9 times out 10 . e-mail functions useless . i tried finding solution hours best i got my email checked every hour but deleted shortly after . internet explorer never find page i'm looking consistently tells me try again . even when connected wi-fi this happens . let me tell you also this device not let you choose wi-fi edge . if you already opened ie you using edge then it continue use edge unless you restart phone wi-fi enabled . calls ----- making call so difficult i wanted smash phone daily basis . usually , i would press talk dial call it would immediately say " call ended . " it if device doesn't even want try . also , when answering call , well trying answer call , it would drop it soon i pressed talk . what hell !? what good phone if you can't make or receive calls ? keep mind this happens around half time . also keep mind i live new york city ! my calls should not dropping except when i'm subway . side volume button extremely annoying causing volume go both extremes within one conversation . not only , but when you disable it , you no other method changing volume device . arggghhh ! keyboard ------- while keyboard basically easy type , phone buggy . first off , t9 sucks ! it completely change word you typing word that its dictionary while you're typing ! extremely frustrating ! now get this , you can't even permanently keep t9 off . so you keep going into menu change it normal abc mode . while i appreciate ability faster typing , isn't whole point qwerty able type without using t9 ? when you actually get typing , sometimes , keys " stick " character continuously repeat until you stop it . this isn't physical keyboard issue but yet software issue . programs ------- all you techno oriented people out there ( basically everyone buying this phone ) , programs this device available download minuscule . not only catalog programs extremely limited but when using java program ( which most programs coded ) dash java program not allow you open those programs . i always get error stating " java midlet not responding " it then gives me choice waiting or killing app . neither which solve anything . this phone so useless it beyond words . i could go it issues but i really don't care . stay away this phone ! while t-mobile customer support very helpful friendly , their service/coverage non-existent . calls constantly dropped , i get voice mails without phone even ringing , internet connectivity never really available . please , yourself favor wait iphone .	1

there many good reviews 8525 positive features most fairly accurate . lots good features 8525 . my intent document some shortcomings 8525 windows mobile os hope ms htc heed correct future . i am business user who wanted combine my hp ipaq 1945 my motorola v550 cell phone into one device . i use motorola h700 headset my old devices 8525 . my overall assessment ; replacing my two 3 year old devices resulted me accepting some compromises i don't think necessary terms functionality ease use . all features i describe below earlier windows mobile os used my ipaq 1945 or my motorola flip phone . if readers find there way perform any deficiencies i describe please let me know . my suggestions rough order priority : 1 ) blue tooth headsets . blue tooth audio should always come through blue tooth headset regardless pda volume setting . hear my voice commands repeated , i turn annoying sound pda , so when i voice dial via my blue tooth headset , i hear my voice commands repeated back . i am referring standard voice dial comes 8525 . one quick solution would tie bt headset phone volume setting rather than pda . even nicer would upgrade allows full audio " voicecommand " software ( this documented many other reviews ) . nice feature my motorola cell phone soon bt detected phone volume changed vibrate audio if it set vibrate . it changed back original audio setting after turning off bt headset . 1a ) if i request voice dial via my blue tooth headset screen should always display voice dial page . instead initial " owner info " page stays up you can't see name screen unless you reach down tap screen . not desirable when driving . if you didn't set pda its annoying noise level you can't hear name you requested either . 2 ) need able control pda phone volume independently audio , vibrate or off . example need able tie turn up phone volume while keeping pda volume setting off or vibrate . 3 ) need able program how long display stays . i am constantly groping find power button side keep display it turns off when i need see something . 4 ) i would buy non bluetooth headset if one available long drives when my bt headset battery dead . only solution i see 8525 stereo headphones turning speaker which little noisy listeners while driving freeway . 5 ) provide built way make ptt comm manager , ie quick key buttons programmable . i would use them many other functions ; such ptt bringing up volume control so i change it vibrate audio speaker ( need able select speaker here see below ) . 6 ) give me way press external button toggle speaker off . i can't easily push speaker icon my fingers . suggestion . add radio button volume control allows you select speaker phone . yes you select phone speaker soft button , but often display gone blank keypad showing . turning speaker on/off should easier . 7 ) provide option save email attachments storage card . my ipaq windows os allowed me capture lots attachments without running out memory . 8 ) remember filter setting i selected tasks . if i filtered task category during session remember filter i selected . currently i so many tasks there 5 second delay bring them all up 9 ) give me way turn off internet browser quick key ( or make this button programmable ) i am always close browser because it gets hit/selected10 ) let me edit/paste one step notes , word , task notes etc . ipaq " edit " bottom . 8525 os you must select menu , then edit , then copy . keep edit bottom . question : there key keypad select cntrl copy like what pc ( letters underlined menu , but i don't see cntrl key keypad ? 11 ) allow trackwheel scroll up icons top then use nav button move across icons ( might way allow external way set audio volume)12 ) if i power off device it remember my input selection . example i select " letter recognizer " . but i must reset each time i power 8525 off .	1
